    "since the matter fields are significantly heavier than @xmath2 , it is customary to introduce the matter fields as heavy particles , _",

    "the propagators of the matter fields are always @xmath17 , and in the leading order of a derivative expansion the matter fields couples to the goldstone bosons through the axial currents . @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the goldstone boson axial current , `` str '' denotes the supertrace over all the quark and ghost flavors , and @xmath20 is the axial current operator between the initial state @xmath21 and the final state @xmath22 .",
    "the form of @xmath20 depends on the matter fields in question .",
    "for example , the axial current of the vector meson fields @xmath23 takes the following form @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an undetermined coupling constant , while the exact forms of the baryon axial current couplings can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the chiral lagrangian of q@xmath5pt is complicated by the existence of hairpin axial current couplings , which couplings @xmath6 and @xmath8 to the flavor singlet axial current of matter fields . @xmath26 { \\rm str}[a_\\mu]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & i n^{1/2 } ( h / f ) \\,{\\rm str}\\ , [ x^\\mu_{(h_{(f)}^\\dag , h_{(i)})}]\\partial_\\mu ( \\eta ' - \\tilde \\eta ' ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after writing down the interaction lagrangians , one can study the chiral limit of different physical quantities by calculating the one chiral loop renormalizations .",
    "for example , the mass renormalization of the matter fields can be evaluated through the following integral , @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad{p_\\nu p_\\mu\\over v\\cdot p}\\ ; ( \\hbox{propagator of the goldstone boson } ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all possible intermediate states .",
    "note that the expression inside the square brackets are independent of @xmath28 and hence can be taken out of the integral .",
    "so @xmath29 just depends on the form of the propagators of the goldstone bosons .",
    "for all the flavor non - singlet states the propagators are @xmath30 , which is also the form of the `` single pole '' propagator of @xmath6 and @xmath8 . putting these propagators in the integral with",
    "contribute to @xmath29 with the generic form @xmath31 this @xmath32 term has a singular dependence of @xmath33 which is due to low - energy chiral dynamics and can not be canceled by counterterms .",
    "since such a term also appear in normal @xmath5pt , they are called standard chiral singularities . in contrast , if the contribution to the loop integral due to the `` double pole '' propagator is of the form : @xmath34 this term @xmath35 is more singular in the chiral limit than the @xmath36 term above and is a quenched artifact , which is usually called quenched chiral singularities .",
    "since these quenched chiral singularities dominate over the standard ones in the chiral limit , understanding them may be helpful in the determination of the best extrapolation of lattice qcd results to the zero mass limit",
    ".    naively , both the standard and quenched chiral singularities may depend on the normal axial coupling @xmath25 and the hairpin axial coupling @xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that the quenched chiral singularities are independent of the value of @xmath37 .",
    "the reasoning is very simple : the quenched chiral singularities come from @xmath6 and @xmath8 loops , and these goldstone bosons can couple to the matter field through either the standard or hairpin axial current couplings .    the matter field , made entirely of quarks and/or antiquarks , can not couple to @xmath8 through the standard axial coupling , hence @xmath38 on the other hand , @xmath6 and @xmath8 couple at the same strength through the hairpin coupling , but with opposite signs .",
    "@xmath39 hence the total couplings are @xmath40    the one loop integral is proportional to @xmath41 all @xmath37 dependences have canceled , as claimed .    actually , the result can be obtained in a more elegant way .",
    "let s define @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are orthogonal linear combinations .",
    "notice that the hairpin axial couplings always couple to str@xmath45 . on the other hand , since the `` double pole '' propagator mixes @xmath6 and @xmath8 , one can diagonalize it to find out its eigenstates .",
    "they turn out to be exactly @xmath46 . @xmath47",
    "since @xmath44 has eigenvalue zero , it does not propagate under the `` double pole '' propagator at all ! in other words , quenched chiral singularities are solely due to @xmath43 loops , while the hairpin axial couplings couple only to @xmath48 . as a result , the hairpin axial current couplings can not contribute to the quenched chiral singularities .",
    "after proving that the hairpin axial current couplings do not contribute to quenched chiral singularities for mass renormalizations , it is time to study the possible generalizations and/or limitation of our result .",
    "first of all , can our analysis be extended to more than two flavors , with possibly different masses for different flavors ? in the presence of different quark masses , it is more convenient to use instead of the singlet basis @xmath49 , the flavor basis @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the ghost degenerate with quark @xmath52 .",
    "the hairpin axial current couplings go through @xmath53 , in the leading order of flavor symmetry breaking . on the other hand , the `` double pole '' propagator now takes the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a @xmath56 matrix .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "it is now easy to check that @xmath59 annihilate @xmath44 , especially if one notice that by the same representation @xmath44 can be expressed as @xmath60 and the last two dimensional column submatrix is annihilated by the @xmath61 square submatrix in @xmath59 .",
    "hence our result holds even when the quarks are not degenerate .",
    "in fact it only depends on the one - to - one degeneracy between the quarks and the ghosts .",
    "it is also clear in this representation that our result _ can not _ be generalized to partially quenched theories , _",
    "i.e. _ , theories in which the number of quarks and ghosts are different .",
    "in fact it is straightforward to show that , in partially quenched theories with @xmath9 quarks and @xmath62 ghosts , the quenched chiral singularities and @xmath63 mesons do not have double pole in their propagators .",
    "instead they have two different single poles , one at the original position @xmath64 , while the other is shifted to @xmath65 .",
    "please refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "here we refer to the renormalization due to the shifted pole propagator as quenched chiral singularities , but in fact they are no more singular than the standard corrections unless one goes to the fully quenched limit . ]",
    "have the generic form @xmath66 , where @xmath25 and @xmath37 are the standard and hairpin axial current couplings respectively .",
    "so far we have been studying exclusively mass renormalization .",
    "does our result hold for renormalization of other physical quantities ? before answering this question , we must ascertain what we mean by standard and/or quenched chiral singularities under such circumstances .",
    "suppose we are interested in studying the chiral correction to a certain operator @xmath67 which acts on matter fields .",
    "the `` single pole '' propagator will lead to operator renormalization with the following integral form : @xmath68{p_\\nu\\over v\\cdot p}{\\cal o}{p_\\mu\\over v\\cdot p } { 1\\over p^2-m^2}.\\ ] ] we will refer whatever chiral correction induced by this term as standard chiral corrections . on the other hand , the `` double pole '' will induce corrections of another form : @xmath68{p_\\nu\\over v\\cdot p}{\\cal o}{p_\\mu\\over v\\cdot p }   { -na_0 + nm_0 ^ 2 \\over ( p^2-m^2)^2},\\ ] ] which we will refer as quenched chiral corrections .",
    "generically , if the standard chiral correction takes the form of @xmath69 in the chiral limit , the quenched chiral correction is more singular with the form @xmath70 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize our result to the following statement : _ quenched one - chiral loop corrections for matter field properties are independent of the values of hairpin couplings .",
    "_ this is the main result of this section , and there is one important exception to this rule , which will be discussed later .",
    "the author does _ not _ claim to be the first to note this pattern of cancelation of hairpin axial coupling in quenched chiral divergences .",
    "our result is `` immediate '' ( to quote steve sharpe @xcite ) from the quark flow diagrams in ref .",
    "when one surveys the existing literature it is probable that the authors of previous articles on q@xmath5pt on matter field are aware of such a pattern ( although , as far as the author is aware of , this is the first systematic discussion of this result ) .",
    "for example , labrenz and sharpe has calculated the quenched chiral singularities ( eq .  ( 97  99 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for baryons in three flavor q@xmath5pt and indeed they are independent of the the hairpin axial couplings .",
    "so are the quenched chiral corrections to the octet baryon axial charges as calculated by kim and kim @xcite .",
    "our rule also holds for heavy mesons , where booth",
    "@xcite as well as sharpe and zhang @xcite has calculated the renormalizations of heavy meson decay constants , masses , bag constants , and isgur  wise form factors . in all these cases the hairpin axial couplings do not contribute to the quenched chiral corrections .",
    "the same can be said for chiladze s work on heavy baryons @xcite . for easy comparison with the literature we list the standard and hairpin axial coupling constants in ref .",
    "@xcite in the following table :    more interesting are the cases where this result actually fails .",
    "this is the case for the paper by booth , chiladze and falk on q@xmath5pt for vector mesons @xcite , which is subsequently extended to the tensor mesons case by chow and rey @xcite . for these cases the hairpin axial current couplings , which is denoted as @xmath71 in ref .",
    "@xcite , does contribute to the quenched chiral singularities .",
    "the reason for this breakdown of our result is clear . in our analysis above we have assumed that the only source of quenched chiral singularities is the `` double pole '' term in the @xmath6 and @xmath63 propagators , while for the case of vector and tensor mesons there are additional sources of quenched singularities , namely the possible hairpin diagrams for these matter fields themselves , which may lead to `` double pole '' propagators for these matter fields .",
    "however , if one explicitly setting the hairpin diagrams on these matter fields to be zero ( _ i.e. _ , if one set the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , then our results are applicable . in other words ,",
    "the hairpin axial current coupling @xmath71 can not contribute to quenched chiral singularities which involve the @xmath6 and @xmath8 `` double pole '' propagators ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) but in general will contribute to the standard chiral singularities ( @xmath76 ) as well as the quenched chiral singularities which do not involve the @xmath6 `` double pole '' propagator ( @xmath77 ) . also note that there are more hairpin couplings for q@xmath5pt for vector and tensor mesons , which are called @xmath78 and @xmath79 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath79 does involve str@xmath80 \\sim \\partial_\\mu \\eta'_-$ ] and hence our result is applicable to this @xmath79 coupling .",
    "indeed it does not contribute to any of the quenched chiral singularities .",
    "on the other hand , the definition of @xmath78 does _ not _ involve str@xmath80 $ ] and hence is not constrained by our result .    in summary",
    ", we have proved that the quenched chiral corrections to matter field properties are independent of the values of the hairpin axial current couplings . besides serving as a useful check of the correctness of q@xmath5pt calculation results",
    ", this observation may be useful in the eventual determination of parameters in the q@xmath5pt lagrangians .",
    "all the coupling constants appearing in the q@xmath5pt lagrangians are nonperturbative quantities which can not be calculated from first principles from quenched qcd and has to be extracted from lattice results ( just as the paramaters in standard @xmath5pt lagrangians have to be extracted from experimental data ) .",
    "while one can extract the `` double pole '' parameters from lattice results on goldstone boson systems , it may be difficult to disentangle the effects of the standard axial couplings from their hairpin counterparts .",
    "our result suggests the procedure that one should extract the values of the standard axial couplings from the quenched chiral corrections , and with those pieces of information one can proceed to extract the values of the hairpin axial couplings from the standard chiral divergences .",
    "chiral perturbation theory , both the standard and quenched versions , provides a systematic framework to describe low energy interactions between hadrons . before one constructs a chiral lagrangian , however , one must decide which fields to include .",
    "there is no clear cut criteria on which fields should be included , but the conventional wisdom suggested that one should _ at least _ include all fields which are related by light flavor su(@xmath9 ) ( @xmath81 or 3 , depending on the scenario ) , as well as all the fields which are degenerate in the large @xmath82 limit .",
    "if the hadron in question contains a heavy quark , then we should also include all the fields related by heavy quark spin symmetry as well .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite both the vector meson octet and the singlet appeared in the chiral lagrangian , as the octet and the singlet are degenerate in the large @xmath82 limit .",
    "in fact they can be conveniently combined into a u(3 ) nonet . similarly in ref .",
    "@xcite the baryon chiral lagrangian contains both the octet and the decuplet , which are again degenerate in the large @xmath82 limit .",
    "it is well known that , in standard @xmath5pt , the failure to include the baryon decuplet will lead to huge chiral corrections to baryon octet , while the chiral loops in a @xmath5pt with both the octet and the decuplet is much smaller @xcite . physically these degenerate states are strongly coupled to each other , and the failure to include them will lead to an incomplete representation of the interaction , causing a badly - behaved loop expansion .    in both the real world and its quenched approximation on the lattice , however , all these symmetries ( chiral , heavy quark , and large @xmath82 ) are broken and the degeneracies are only approximate . in ( q)@xmath5pt , one often ( though not always ) treats these mass splittings as small perturbations and include them leading to the leading order .",
    "while such approximations are usually justified , they are not entirely satisfactory as it is not clear if the higher order effects will change the chiral behavior drastically .",
    "the question can be put more impendingly in the following way .",
    "let s take the chiral corrections to hadron masses as an example . since the one loop diagram has two axial current couplings , each giving a factor of @xmath83 , one can obtain from dimensional analysis that @xmath84 simply on the basis that the goldstone boson mass @xmath85 is _ the only other mass scale in the theory_. appear only when @xmath86 is an integer , so that the effect of shifting the subtraction point @xmath87 can be canceled by a counterterm analytic in @xmath88 . in this case @xmath89 , and chiral logarithms are forbidden . ] in other words , the chiral behavior of the mass correction can not be changed unless some other mass scale is introduced in the theory . in q@xmath5pt ,",
    "the new mass scale is @xmath15 , and the quenched chiral singularities are proportional to @xmath90 , which dominate in the chiral limit .",
    "now the mass splitting @xmath91 between states is another new mass scale and can potentially change the chiral behavior .",
    "the question is , will it ?",
    "fortunately , it is possible to study the feynman integral exactly .",
    "this has been done in @xmath5pt in ref .",
    "@xcite for baryons ( though the treatment is general and can be applied to other systems as well ) , and the generalization to q@xmath5pt is trivial .    let s review the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , which study the integral difference between our definition of @xmath92 and that in ref .  @xcite .",
    "] @xmath93 where we will assume @xmath94 so that the intermediate state is heavier than the external state and hence the integral does not have any cuts corresponding to real particle decays ( which will be the subject matter of the following section )",
    ". then the integral can be evaluated exactly .",
    "it is instructive to separate the result into two parts : @xmath95 the analytic contribution @xmath96 can be canceled by counterterms , while the nonanalytic contribution can not be modified by counterterms and is genuine signature of low energy chiral dynamics .",
    "@xmath97 where @xmath87 is the subtraction point .",
    "this nonanalytic contribution is plotted in fig .  1 , with @xmath87 set to be equal to @xmath91 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is clear that , while @xmath99 does behave like @xmath36 at large @xmath85 for both values of @xmath87 , @xmath100 , \\qquad m\\gg\\delta,\\ ] ] there are nontrivial corrections in the chiral limit due to a non - vanishing @xmath91 for @xmath101 , while the chiral behavior is much better - behaved with @xmath102 .",
    "it should be understood that changes in @xmath87 generate extra analytic terms ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 terms in this case ) , which should be absorbed into @xmath105 . to see it more explicitly one can perform a taylor expansion around @xmath106 @xcite , @xmath107\\ ] ] the @xmath108 term is actually analytic in @xmath103 which can be absorbed into the analytic part and canceled by counterterms .",
    "it vanishes , however , at @xmath102 , explaining why the @xmath102 curve approaches the chiral limit so nicely .",
    "the leading nonanalytic contribution is @xmath109 , quite different from the @xmath36 behavior when @xmath110 .",
    "in fact the @xmath111 suppression factor is reminding us that this is a higher dimensional operator produced on integrating out the heavier intermediate state .",
    "the corresponding integral in q@xmath5pt is @xmath112 where the subscript @xmath52 stands for `` quenched '' . as discussed above",
    ", the quenched chiral singularities comes from the @xmath15 term .",
    "so for simplicity we will set @xmath113 is the discussion below , and @xmath114 we are only interested in the nonanalytic part @xmath115 , which is @xmath116 we see the expected @xmath117 nonlinear behavior for large @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath118,\\qquad m\\gg\\delta.\\ ] ] and for small @xmath85 , @xmath119,\\ ] ] so the leading nonanalytic term is @xmath120 , again quite different from the @xmath121 behavior with vanishing @xmath91 .",
    "another interesting point is shown in fig .  2 , where @xmath115 is plotted with @xmath101 and @xmath98 . in this case",
    "a change in @xmath87 just shifts the curve vertically but do not change the `` shape '' at all , as dictated by the taylor expansion above , where the coefficient in front of the @xmath122 term is just a constant in @xmath85 .",
    "note that such a vertical shift would not affect extrapolations to the chiral limit at all as the `` shapes '' of the curves are identical .",
    "what does the analysis above imply for real lattice qcd simulations ?",
    "note that the nonlinear behavior in fig .",
    "2 appears around @xmath123 .",
    "so the implication of fig .  2 is twofold .",
    "firstly , it suggests that , for @xmath124 , the extrapolation of hadron masses to the chiral limit should be linear , a fact which is consistent with existing lattice results . on the other hand , it predicts the breakdown of such linear behaviors at @xmath125 , a regime which is not yet well - explored . in real lattice qcd simulation",
    ", the application of this analysis is complicated by the existence of more than one possible intermediate states , and hence more than one @xmath91 .",
    "however , one can still make some qualitative predictions .",
    "for example , since the n@xmath91 splitting is around 300 mev , one expects the extrapolation for the nucleon mass departs from a linear behavior at around 150 mev ( about the physical pion mass ) . on the other hand",
    ", the small @xmath126@xmath127 splitting ( 17 mev ) means that probably a simple linear extrapolation is sufficient in the vector meson sector .",
    "certainly more detailed studies along this line , especially for physical quantities other than masses , will be very useful to the extraction of physical information from lattice data .",
    "in this previous section , we have studied two point functions with the intermediate state @xmath128 _ heavier _ than the external state @xmath129 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath130 . in this section",
    ", we will consider the opposite , where @xmath131 and the intermediate state is _ lighter _ than the external state .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the case which @xmath132 , and at large euclidean time the two point function will be dominated the @xmath133 state , resulting in a cut in the two point function . however , often these decays involve creating a quark ",
    "antiquark pair from the vacuum .",
    "the question is , can hadron decay be studied on lattice under the quenched approximation ?    in this section , we are going to derive `` selection rules '' for the hadron decays under quenched approximation .",
    "for example , an obvious selection rule is _ the daughter hadrons can not contain any valence quark which does not appear in the mother hadron as valence quark _ , as these new valence flavors have to from an internal quark loop .",
    "we will see below that quenching does impose strong constraints on the possible decay mechanisms .",
    "we will focus at system with the standard and hairpin axial current couplings ( denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath37 respectively ) , but no other kind of couplings ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath78 and @xmath79 in ref .",
    "@xcite are out ) .",
    "then there are two classes of diagrams representing hadron decays :    \\(1 ) diagrams which all the vertices are standard couplings @xmath25 , and no hairpin propagators .",
    "the corresponding integrals will be proportional to @xmath134 .",
    "since these decays have clear analogs in standard ( unquenched ) qcd , we will call them `` standard decays '' .",
    "\\(2 ) decays with one hairpin axial vertex ( integral @xmath135 ) , and/or diagrams with the `` double pole '' propagator on the goldstone boson line ( integral @xmath136 ) .",
    "these decays may either have analogs in qcd or be merely quenched artifacts .",
    "we will call these `` hairpin decays '' .",
    "we will first consider standard decays for meson .",
    "it is trivial to see that ozi suppressed decays , like @xmath137 , can not take place under the quenched approximation .",
    "however , not all ozi allowed decays can survive quenching .",
    "decays through fig .",
    "3a , which contains an internal quark loop , are not allowed in quenched qcd , while decays through fig .",
    "3b are preserved .",
    "note , however , that the quark and the antiquark from an external meson line in fig .",
    "3b annihilate , demanding that the external meson must be flavor neutral .",
    "however , isospin symmetry , which is a good symmetry of q@xmath5pt , can rotate flavor neutral states into flavor states _",
    "unless the flavor neutral state has isospin zero_. hence , we have the selection rule that for _ the only possible standard meson decays are ozi allowed decays of @xmath138 mesons .",
    "_ the amplitude of such decays in quenched qcd is identical to its counterpart in standard qcd .",
    "an example of such decay is @xmath139 in the vector meson sector , and its tensor meson analog @xmath140 ; unfortunately these processes do not happen in the real world where the total mass of the daughter particles is larger than the mother particle .",
    "it turns out that light mesons , which form u(3 ) nonets , usually mix ideally so that the @xmath138 mass eigenstates are the @xmath141 state and the @xmath142 states .",
    "the @xmath141 states , like the @xmath143 vector meson and the @xmath144 tensor meson , can either decay through ozi suppressed modes like @xmath137 , which is clearly disallowed in quenched qcd , or modes like @xmath145 , which is described by fig .  3a and hence also do not survive quenching . and while the @xmath146 state , like the @xmath127 vector meson and the @xmath147 tensor meson in principle can decay through fig .",
    "3b , they are so light that they can not decay into the @xmath148 state in the same nonet ( @xmath126 and @xmath149 , respectively ) .",
    "so the only possibility for standard decays in the meson sector are decays of an @xmath138 state from a highly excited nonet to two lighter @xmath148 states in other nonets .",
    "these decays can not be described by q@xmath5pt as they involve transitions between different nonets , and it is probably difficult to really observe these decays on the lattice as these highly excited states may be very dirty . in passing we note that heavy mesons do not have standard decays in quenched qcd .    in the baryon sector",
    "we are interested in studying decays like @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the former decay has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , from which we will borrow heavily .",
    "the main complication in studying these baryon decays is that the initial and final baryons have different isospin wave functions to satisfy the spin - statistics theorem . for concreteness , ref .",
    "@xcite has chosen to study the decay of @xmath152 , which in standard qcd the only possible decay mode is : @xmath153 note that a @xmath154 pair is created .",
    "so _ naively _",
    "@xmath152 decay is prohibited by quenching .",
    "this argument , however , was shown to be wrong in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "standard decays for baryons can go through either fig .",
    "4a , which has an internal quark loop and hence does not survive quenching , and fig .",
    "4b , which does .",
    "we will denote the amplitude of @xmath152 decaying through fig .",
    "4a as @xmath155 , where @xmath52 is the quark on the internal loop , while @xmath156 is the amplitude of its decay through fig",
    ".  4b . in the unquenched world",
    ", the total decay amplitude is @xmath157 on the other hand , fermionic statistics of the quark forbids the existence of an intermediate @xmath158 octet .",
    "hence we have @xmath159 and hence @xmath160    the @xmath152 decay amplitude after quenching is @xmath161 the cancelation of quark loops and ghost loops demands that @xmath162 which gives @xmath163 so the decay amplitude changes sign under quenching . a more illuminating way to present the result is to note that @xmath164 as the sum in each pair of parentheses vanishes .",
    "so in quenched qcd @xmath152 decays to @xmath165,which clearly has the opposite sign as the qcd decay .",
    "how does this lesson generalize to other baryon decays ?",
    "we will focus our attention to the orbitally unexcited baryons , which are the states with most physical interest .",
    "in other words , we will consider the octet - decuplet light baryon system , and the antitriplet - sextet heavy baryon system .",
    "now we make the phenomenological observation that , while baryon decays through pion emission are possible in both of these systems ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath166 and @xmath151 ) , in neither of these system can baryon decay through @xmath167 or @xmath168 decay as physically these mesons are too massive .",
    "we will make the assumption that this pattern continue to hold in quenched qcd .",
    "then fig .",
    "4b demands that , for decay through pion emission to take place , the initial state must has at least two light valence quarks .",
    "so the selection rule is : _ standard decays for baryons are possible if the decaying baryon has at least two light valence quarks _ , and the list includes @xmath169 n and @xmath170 . and for all of these decays , the quenched amplitude has the same magnitude but opposite sign as the unquenched counterpart . on the other hand ,",
    "orbitally unexcited @xmath171 s and @xmath172 s do not have standard decays under the quenched approximation . our rule does not apply to orbitally excited baryons , which may have enough phase space to decay through @xmath167 and @xmath168 emission , but again studying these states on the lattice may be quite difficult .",
    "after studying the standard decays , let s now move on to the hairpin decays",
    ". hairpin decays either have a `` double pole '' goldstone propagator , leading to an integral proportional to @xmath173 ( the hairpin axial coupling @xmath37 can not appear ; see section 1 ) , or are interference effects between the standard coupling @xmath25 and the hairpin coupling @xmath37 , _ i.e. _ , proportional to @xmath174 .",
    "note that the @xmath175 term is absent here as in that case the goldstone boson line would form a quark loop . in other words , the hairpin vertex @xmath37 can cross interfere with @xmath25 , but not self interfere , which is an evidence for non - unitarity .",
    "the important observation here is , hairpin decays always have the form @xmath176 , as only @xmath6 couples through hairpin coupling , or propagate through the `` double pole '' propagator . since @xmath6 is a singlet under flavor su(2 ) and",
    "su(3 ) , however , it means that _ hairpin decays can take place only between multiplets with the same representation under the flavor group_.    in the view of this result , the most natural places to look for these hairpin decays are transitions between a heavy quark doublet , like @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "since the two states in a heavy quark doublet is related by just flipping the heavy quark spin , they always have identical flavor representation . as discussed above , there are no standard decay for @xmath179 , and this hairpin decay is the only possible mode under the quenched approximation",
    ". the @xmath180 baryon can decay to @xmath181 , which would probably dominate over this hairpin mode , as the latter in suppressed in the large @xmath82 limit @xcite . in the real world , moreover , @xmath180 is only 80 mev above @xmath182 , so probably this hairpin decay can not take place after all .",
    "the strange quark is not massive enough to be considered a heavy quark , and while the `` strange quark doublet '' @xmath183 and @xmath184 have the same representation under flavor su(2 ) ( both have @xmath148 ) , their flavor su(3 ) representations are different ( @xmath184 is in the octet , @xmath183 is in the decuplet ) .",
    "hence the hairpin decay @xmath185 is flavor su(3 ) suppressed .",
    "lastly , note that hairpin decays from the tensor meson nonet to the vector meson nonet are allowed under this selection rule , and in principle one can study these decays on the lattice .",
    "these decays , however , are not described within the framework of ( q)@xmath5pt , where the tensor meson number and vector meson number are separately conserved .    in conclusion , we have chosen that quenching provides severe `` selection rules '' on hadron decays .",
    "studying decay on lattice are important as it provide one of the most direct way to determine the values of the coupling constants in the q@xmath5pt lagrangian ( just as experimental decay rate can lead to determinations of coupling constants in the standard chiral lagrangian ) .",
    "one can obtained @xmath186 @xcite from @xmath169n@xmath13 , and @xmath187 @xcite from @xmath151 .",
    "regretfully , hadron decays are not observable in most of the lattice qcd simulations in the present generation as the light quark masses are still relatively large , and hence @xmath188 .",
    "but it is probable that , with the improvement in algorithms and increase in available computational power , probing the small @xmath85 region would be a feasible endeavor in the not - too - distant future .",

    "<S> three topics about the application of quenched chiral perturbation theory to matter fields are studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that the hairpin axial current couplings in quenched chiral perturbation theories do not contribute to the quenched chiral singularities for one chiral loop renormalization of matter field properties . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of mass corrections in the chiral limit due to nonzero mass splittings are studied , and selection rules for hadron decays in quenched qcd are obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> most lattice qcd simulations are performed under the quenched approximation , where the fermionic determinant is set to unity . </S>",
    "<S> while in the real world the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks have masses much less than @xmath2 , lattice qcd are often simulated with @xmath3 , and physical results are extracted by extraplation to the chiral limit @xmath4 . as a result , it is important to understand the chiral limit of quenched qcd . over the past few years , quenched chiral perturbation theory ( q@xmath5pt ) has been formulated as the low energy effective theory of quenched qcd @xcite . in q@xmath5pt , </S>",
    "<S> the cancelation of internal quark loops is enforced by the introduction of ghost quarks ( quarks with wrong  bosonic  </S>",
    "<S> statistics ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the contributions of ghost loops to path integrals are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to those of quark loops , there will be a complete cancelation of loop contribution if there are as many quarks as ghosts , with the same masses . </S>",
    "<S> ( one may also consider partially quenched chiral perturbation theories @xcite , in which the number of quarks and the number of ghosts are different . ) </S>",
    "<S> just as in ordinary chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt ) the low energy dynamics is dominated by the goldstone bosons ( pions for two flavor qcd ) which are quark - antiquark bound states , in q@xmath5pt the low energy dynamics is dominated by the goldstone `` bosons '' which may be quark - antiquark , ghost - antighost , quark - antighost or ghost - antiquark bound states .    </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between @xmath5pt and q@xmath5pt lies in the the role played by the @xmath6 meson . in ordinary qcd </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath6 acquires a heavy mass due to the necklace diagrams and hence are integrated out in the standard formulation of @xmath5pt . since the necklace diagrams involve quark loops , however , they do not contribute in the quenched theory . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 have the same mass as the other goldstone bosons ( massless in the chiral limit ) and can not be integrated out . </S>",
    "<S> it does differ from the other goldstone bosons in having an extra term in its propagator due the the hairpin diagram . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 where the first row / column represents the @xmath6 meson and the second row / column represents the @xmath8 , the ghost - antighost analog of @xmath6 , and @xmath9 is both the number of quark flavors and the number of ghost flavors . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is the usual propagator where @xmath6 and @xmath8 propagate independently with a single pole at @xmath10 , which denotes both @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath13 and @xmath6 are degenerate in quenched qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the second term carries a double pole and represents a possible mixing between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , characterized by the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 .. with three light flavors and @xmath16 , the form of the double pole term will be more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> however , our analysis is independent of the particular form of the double pole term . ]    besides the goldstone boson fields , one can also study the dynamics of matter fields ( vector and tensor mesons @xcite , baryons @xcite , heavy mesons @xcite , heavy baryons @xcite , _ etc . _ ) under the framework of q@xmath5pt . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will discuss three theoretical issue around the application of q@xmath5pt on matter fields . </S>",
    "<S> the first section will prove the ( ir)relevance of hairpin axial couplings ( which will be defined below ) to quenched chiral corrections of matter field quantities . </S>",
    "<S> then the effects of mass splittings in q@xmath5pt will be discussed , followed by the last section which study the possibility of understanding hadron decay in q@xmath5pt . </S>"
