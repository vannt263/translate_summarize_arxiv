    "the long - standing search for a consistent formulation of the abraham - lorentz - dirac equation ( ald ) for a radiating particle remains being a field of intense research activity @xcite .",
    "the complete understanding of the formulation and solution of the equations had presented hard theoretical difficulties .",
    "the existence of solutions with values growing without bound ( runaway behavior ) or pre - accelerated motions in advance to the applied forces , are two of the most debated issues associated to the ald equations @xcite .",
    "important advances in the understanding of these properties had been by now obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the ald equations ca nt be derived in a completely exact way from the integral equations satisfied by the coupled motion of a particle and its accompanying electromagnetic field for non analytically depending forces .",
    "moreover , the author derived a correction to the ald equations which should be used in order to consider suddenly changing forces . the change corresponded to multiplying the reaction force of the field on the particle by a proper - time dependent function @xmath0 which vanish at the proper time value at which the forces is started to be applied , and attains a unit value in a small time interval of the order of the time required by light to travel the radius of the considered structured body studied in ref .",
    "this change was argued to allow eliminating both : the runaway and the pre - accelerated types of solutions .",
    "thus , in general terms , it was concluded that the ald equations are not exact consequences of the integral equations of motions for the coupled system describing the structured particle investigated in ref",
    "in addition , in refs @xcite , the authors presented a derivation of a simpler second order in the time derivative of the position , for a radiating particle , assuming that it shows an internal structure .",
    "the equation derived was argued to be exact for the structured particle , which could justify its incomplete equivalence with the ald equation @xcite .    in the present work , at variance with the studies in refs . @xcite",
    "we will not consider that the radiating particles has a structure .",
    "our work , is rather devoted to identify and study some properties of a curious second order newton type of equation motion for the radiating particle , that when satisfied , by assuming that the force is a infinitely smooth function , directly obey the ald equations .",
    "this occurs in a proper time region of convergence of a particular series conformed with the infinite sequence of the time derivatives of the force at a given instant . the effective force at this instant results to be defined by the local values of the series at that moment , which implies that the  effective force vanishes when the external one is null within an open neighborhood , which eliminates the possibility of pre - acceleration of runway solutions when the external force vanishes .",
    "to motivate the second order equations , firstly we present their equivalence with the ald ones in the non - relativistic version of them for a general 3d motion .",
    "next , the equations are generalized to the relativistic case by a simple construction .",
    "the work also presents the solution of the equations for a simple example of a pulse like force for which the above mentioned particular series of their proper time derivatives converge in the whole time axis .",
    "the effective force is evaluated , and the position , velocity , acceleration and its derivative , are determined from the numerical solution of the equations .",
    "the results does not show runaway or pre - accelerated behaviors , since as noted before , the effective force only depends on the local behavior around a proper time instant .",
    "the case of forces being infinitely smooth , but eventually showing a numerable set of step like discontinuities is also analyzed for the case in which the motion is collinear .",
    "it becomes possible to derive modified ald equation of motion , after assuming that , as in the example of the analytic pulse , the discontinuous force can be expressed as the limit of a sequence of infinitely smooth forces , which define a corresponding sequence of effective forces also showing the same kind of discontinuity as the external one in the limit .",
    "the modified ald equations give a generalization of the ones derived in reference @xcite and fully support the central idea proposed in that work : that the validity of the lienard - wiechert solutions for the electromagnetic field closely around the particle ,  just after the external forces is retired , implies that its acceleration should also suddenly disappears .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that the electromagnetic field in a sufficiently close small vicinity of the particle is given by a lorentz boosted coulomb field , which is known to not produce any force on the central particle . using these modified equations we also investigated their solutions for an external force in the form of a rigorously squared pulse which exactly vanishes outside a given time interval .",
    "an important point to stress is that the delta function like terms within the smooth solution for the squared pulse obtained , follow as `` normal '' contributions to the usual `` radiation '' force terms .",
    "thus , their presence is consistent with the well understood notion about that the ald equation well describe the radiation properties of a moving particle .",
    "however , in addition it also follows that such delta function terms exactly cancel with other ones associated to time derivatives of step like changes in the acceleration occurring at the discontinuities .",
    "this means that , effectively , the discontinuities , do not contribute with finite terms to the radiation , contrary to what could be expected due to the appearance of the delta functions in the modified equations .",
    "the expositions proceed as follows . in section 2 , the newton like equation which solutions also satisfy the non - relativistic ald equations for a general 3d dynamics is presented .",
    "section 3 , generalizes the discussion by constructing a relativist newton like equation which also satisfies the relativistic ald one .",
    "next , section 4 presents concrete conditions which determine that given an infinitely smooth external force , the effective force determined by it , becomes also well defined .",
    "section 5 continues by presenting the numerical solution of the newton second order equations for the case of a force being similar to a squared pulse , but being defined by an analytical function along all the time axis .",
    "the following section 6 is devoted to derive the modified ald equations for forces defined almost everywhere by infinitely smooth functions , but which show step like discontinuities at a denumerable set of instants along the time axis . in section 7 , the modified ald equations are solved for the rigorous squared pulse .",
    "this force pertains to the class of almost everywhere @xmath1 functions , showing step like discontinuities .",
    "the solution is compared with the one associated to the previously studied analytical pulsed force .",
    "they show a very close appearance , indicating the presence of dirac delta functions concentrated at the discontinuity points of the external force in the modified ald equations . finally , in the summary the results are shortly reviewed and possible extensions of the work commented .",
    "let us consider a general but nonrelativistic motion of a particle @xmath2 along a space - time trajectory @xmath3 defined by a curve @xmath4(@xmath5 and parameterized by the time @xmath6  for this motion , the non - relativistic ald equations take the standard form @xmath7 where the index @xmath8 has the three values @xmath9 .  in what follows , without attempting to repeat the trial and error process which led to the mentioned solution , we will directly write its expression for afterwards arguing that it solves the above equations ( [ ald ] )",

    "then , for the time derivative of the acceleration we have @xmath11 where , as before , in the following a point over a quantity will mean a derivative over the defined temporal argument of it .",
    "therefore , assumed that the series is well defined , the trajectory @xmath12  solving equation ( [ newton ] ) , also satisfies the non - relativistic ald  equations@xmath13    now , a question appears about the existence of proper and helpful definitions of the effective force at the r.h.s of equation ( [ newton ] ) .",
    "let us differ the discussion of this point up to the next sections .",
    "there , we will derive a condition to be satisfied by the external force for the effective one to be well defined .",
    "in addition we will construct an explicit example in which the force is infinitely smooth at all the times , allowing to calculate the effective one . in coming section",
    "we will generalize the discussion by determining a second order covariant equation which solution should also satisfy the relativistic ald equations .",

    "it can be argued as follows .",
    "let us consider the same construction of the transformation @xmath49  but defined in another arbitrary observer s frame , and denote it as @xmath50 then , the expressions of the forces in the two considered frames are given as @xmath51 and after multiplying by the inverses of  @xmath52 and @xmath53 if follows @xmath54 which indicates that the defined forces in two arbitrary observer s frame are related by the lorentz transformation @xmath55 linking both reference systems .",

    "let us consider the series defining the components of the effective forces in the rest frame system in the form @xmath77 and consider the three functions @xmath78 as pertaining to the space of infinitely smooth functions @xmath1 with the additional condition that the series converges in an open region of  proper times values .",

    "it is known ,  that when all the times derivatives of a given function at a point are bounded , the functions admits a taylor expansion that converges to the value of the function in a neighborhood of the considered point .",

    "we will solve the effective newton equations for an external force  which constitutes a regularization of a rigorously constant force acting only during a specified time interval of duration @xmath87 and exactly vanishing outside this time lapse .",
    "the degree of the regularization will be defined by a time interval @xmath88 assumed to be very much shorter than @xmath87 .  it will be found that the parameter @xmath88 can be as shorter as ten times the extremely short characteristic time @xmath89 being associated to the radiation reaction forces in the ald equations .",

    ", it will be shown that the solution predicted by the effective newton equations does not show the runaway , nor the pre - accelerated behavior , exhibited by the solutions derived by dirac .",
    "however , it will be also numerically checked that these solutions also satisfy the ald equations .",
    "the explicit form of the `` regularized '' pulse defining the force in the rest frame of the particle will be @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the error function .",

    "let us no consider the series defining the effective force @xmath95  which is associated to the external force @xmath96@xmath97        but , given @xmath98 which is extremely well satisfied by the case of the electromagnetic ald equation , the series defining the effective force will converge just by only requiring that the time derivatives of arbitrary order are uniformly bounded for all time values .",
    "the satisfaction of this condition for the specific form to be considered for the force , after fixing @xmath93 cm and @xmath87 @xmath99 cm , is evidenced in figure [ derivft1 ] .",
    "it shows the plots of the times derivatives of orders @xmath100 it can be observed that all the depicted times derivatives are bounded , and moreover the bound decreases when the order of the derivatives increases .",
    "this behavior is maintained for higher orders , up to values in which the numerical precision becomes degraded in our evaluation .",
    "however , before assuming the form of the force in ( [ pulsef ] ) by fixing the values of @xmath88 and @xmath87 ,  it can be argued that the effective pulse like forces are also well defined for extremely short `` rising '' times @xmath88 and arbitrarily large time lapses @xmath87 of the pulses .",
    "this property can be argued after performing the changes of variables @xmath101 which allows to express the force @xmath102 in the form @xmath103    but , the implemented change of variables , allows to write for the effective force series@xmath104    the last line of this relation , again indicates that with the `` rising '' time being so short as to merely satisfying @xmath105     of the auxiliary functions @xmath106 .",
    "the plots show derivatives up to the order ten of the function @xmath106 being associated to the defined analytic regularization of the square pulse .",

    "but , figure [ derivfx2 ] illustrates that the values of these derivatives as functions of @xmath108  up to order ten , are bounded at all the values of the @xmath4 variable .",
    "this behavior is valid up to high orders for which the numerical precision of the evaluations start to become degraded .",
    "therefore , the results indicate that the regularized constant force pulses , constructed in the described analytic way , well define effective forces for very fast pulses , which can rise so rapidly as few times the ald time constant of nearly 10@xmath109 seconds in the electromagnetic case",
    ".      the equations for the coordinates as functions of the proper time for the pulsed force with the times parameters @xmath93 cm and @xmath87 @xmath99 cm will be now numerically solved . with the use of their definition ( [ secondrel ] )",
    "these equations can be written in the form @xmath110    in this 2d case we have the definitions @xmath111    the  following two newton equations can be explicitly written in the form @xmath112    but employing the definitions of the spatial velocity @xmath113 , 4-velocity @xmath114 and the effective forces @xmath115 @xmath116 the equations for the position and the time describing the trajectories @xmath117 @xmath118 which solve the newton equations become@xmath119    these equations are now solved for the particular values of the parameters@xmath120    the constant @xmath121 will be set to a value being in fact very much higher than the one associated to the electron motion , which is nearly 10@xmath122 cm .",
    "the chosen specific value @xmath123 cm will help to avoid extremely small higher orders contributions in powers of @xmath121 , in the numerical solution of these equations .",
    "it can be noticed that very much larger values of @xmath121 with respect to the one associated with the electron , are also of  physical interest , by example when considering the radiation of small moving objects in the air .",
    "the solutions of the equations were considered for the following initial conditions @xmath124 that is , at a proper time value of @xmath125 cm , the particle is situated at the origin of coordinates with a velocity given the proper time derivative of its coordinates ( the spatial component of the four - velocity ) equal to @xmath126 .",
    "it can be noted that this problem is similar to the one considered by dirac to illustrate the appearance of pre - acceleration in the solutions of the ald equations @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the two situations  is that here the pulse is not rigorously squared  with discontinuous step like transitions , but defined by an analytic function along the whole time axis .    .",
    "the bottom left figure shows the behavior of the acceleration which tends to vanishes outside the times in which the pulse gets appreciable values .",
    "the last graph presents the dependence of the time derivative of the acceleration .",
    "this quantity tends to be peaked around the instants at which the pulse drastically changes its value . ,",
    "width=434 ]    the form of this pulse was shown in figure [ pulse1 ] .",
    "the high value of the ratio @xmath127 gives to this function the approximate pulse like appearance .",
    "the set of plots in figure [ solution4 ] shows in first place , the proper time evolution of the coordinate of the particle , indicating that the motion is nearly free before the time interval of the pulse , for becoming accelerated for the times in which the force is nearly constant .",
    "when the times is large and outside the region in which the force is constant , the solutions becomes again a uniform motion as illustrated by the vanishing of the acceleration in this zone .",
    "note that the solution of the newton equations do not exhibit the pre - acceleration effect , nor the runaway motions after the pulse is passed , as it was the case in the dirac solution of the ald equations @xcite .",
    "this is not a strange result given that the effective force tends to vanish outside the pulse interval .",
    "however , this example allows to numerically check that the obtained solution also satisfies the ald equations .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure [ aldsatis5 ] .",
    "it shows the plot of the following function , which vanishes when the ald equations are satisfied @xmath128     which vanishing implies the satisfaction of the spatial ald equation .",
    "the fact that the values of the function @xmath129 can not be noticed in the plot , checks the very approximate satisfaction of the spatial ald equation , width=283 ]    in common with the plot of the time derivative of the acceleration term of the ald equations , which is the term of the equations showing , in general , the smaller values along the times axis .",
    "as it can be noticed , the values of the function @xmath130 can not be noticed in comparison with the values of the third derivative term .",
    "this indicates that the ald equations are satisfied within the precision of the numerical approximation of the solution , confirming the general derivation presented before .",
    "therefore an interesting conclusion arises : the obtained solution of the effective newton equation , at the same time that also satisfies the ald equation ,  avoids the appearance of the pre - acceleration or runaways effects .",
    "this example of an analytically regularized pulse , leads to an idea about how justify a modification of the ald equations for the case of non analytically defined forces , presented in reference @xcite .",
    "this point will discussed in next sections .",
    "we will now assume that the existence of a sequence of forces @xmath131 @xmath132 in all the proper time axis , which also show , for each @xmath133 , convergent values of the series defining their effective forces @xmath134 @xmath132 .",
    "a first general purpose of this section will be to argue that , assumed that the sequence @xmath135 converges to a piecewise continuous limiting force @xmath136 , the sequence of solutions of the corresponding effective newton equations ald equations will tend to satisfy a set of modified ald equations , which form will be also determined .",
    "it will follow that these equations just generalize the ones which were proposed in reference @xcite .  in that work",
    ", these equations were simply advanced under the basis of an idea : when a force acting over a radiating classical electron is instantly removed , the lienard wiechert solution for the electromagnetic field surrounding the electron within a sufficiently close neighborhood of its position , should be instantly defined by a lorentz boost transformed coulomb field .",
    "but such fields , are known to exert a vanishing four - force over the electron .",
    "this simple observation strongly suggests that the mechanical equations driving the electron motion , should be able to reproduce this effect : that is , to instantaneously lead the acceleration of the particle to vanish , when a force is removed in a extremely rapid way .",
    "the here found equations of motion implement this property .",
    "let us firstly consider that the proper time axis is subdivided in a denumerable set of contiguous  intervals by the specific sequence of increasing values of times @xmath137    the general intervals ( @xmath138 for arbitrary @xmath43 values will be called as the `` transition '' intervals , in which the arbitrary time derivatives for the forces of the sequence of @xmath139 for all @xmath133 values will be assumed as well defined , by also determining bounded values for the effective forces @xmath140 for all values of @xmath141  in the limit @xmath142 we will assume that all the times @xmath143 not showing the superindex @xmath133 ,  will remain constant , and the other instant will have limits @xmath144  in the limit @xmath142 the sequence of forces will be assumed to possibly approach a piecewise discontinuous limiting force at the points @xmath143 at all @xmath43 values .    on the opposite way , within all the intervals @xmath145 the sequence of force functions will be assumed to tend to an infinitely smooth function of the proper time , by also leading to well defined effective forces . in particular if the force functions are given by polynomial functions of the proper time with maximal order @xmath146 , the series defining the effective forces , having a finite number of terms , will always well define effective forces .    due to the assumption about the existence of the sequence of effective forces along all the whole time axis for all finite @xmath133 values",

    "then , this condition will imply that the time integrals of the forces within all the transition intervals @xmath147 should vanish when these intervals shrink in the limit @xmath148  therefore , since integrals of this sort will define the discontinuity in the four - velocities in the limit @xmath149 it follows that the four - velocities should be continuous in the @xmath150 limit .",
    "consider now the sequence of the solutions of the of the effective newton equations @xmath151 for all values of @xmath133 . from the previous discussion , it is clear that for each @xmath133 value , the 4-velocities as functions of the time will not tend to develop discontinuities across the transition intervals when they reduce their sizes in the limit @xmath148  this follows , because the effective forces are assumed to exist and to be also bounded .",
    "thus , the impulses  of these forces during the shrinking  transition intervals should tend to zero .",
    "therefore , we will have that the sequence of solutions tend to be piecewise smooth trajectory @xmath151 showing also a continuous velocity at the transition points in the @xmath142 limit .",
    "strictly inside all the intervals ( @xmath152 @xmath153 the solutions @xmath154 can be constructed as satisfying the @xmath142 limit of the newton equation , since the limiting @xmath142 values of the forces and the effective forces within these intervals are assumed to be smooth and also bounded .",
    "then , in these zones they will also satisfy the ald equation  therefore , within each of these intervals the limiting @xmath142 trajectory @xmath155 should satisfy the effective newton equations @xmath156 in which the effective forces @xmath157  are defined by@xmath158 with @xmath159 being the limit @xmath142 of the sequence of forces @xmath160 for the time taken within the interval ( @xmath161 at this point , as noted in the introduction , we will restrict the discussion in this section to collinear motions .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary motions seems to be feasible , and it will be considered elsewhere .",
    "however , due to the assumed developing of step like discontinuities of the force values after the limit @xmath149 at the transition points @xmath162 we can have for the effective four - force possibly different values at the left @xmath163 and right @xmath164 of the transition instants , with values@xmath165 where , as noted before the coordinates and velocities are continuous at both sides of the  transition point @xmath166 we will also define the force functions inside each of the intervals @xmath167 as @xmath168 for @xmath19 @xmath169 @xmath170 thus @xmath171 since these two limiting forces are equal to the mass @xmath172 times de accelerations at any instant ,  this relation says that the accelerations can be discontinuous at those instants .",
    "this property defines a clear deviation from the case of the solutions showing pre - acceleration or runaway behavior , which are assumed to have continuous accelerations  @xcite .",
    "then , let us now argue that the effective equations ( [ efective ] )  with the two boundary conditions ( [ cond1]),([cond2 ] ) are equivalent to the set of modified ald equations@xmath173 where  the dirac delta function , let say @xmath174  is defined as linear functionals determined by a sequence of functions of time @xmath175(@xmath176 all having time integrals equal to the unit for any @xmath133 value .",
    "their supports for each @xmath133 is defined by intervals @xmath177  with positive @xmath178 , which tend to vanish in the limit @xmath142 .",
    "the linear functional acting over a possibly piecewise continuous function @xmath179 is then defined as the integral@xmath180    therefore , if the function @xmath181 has a discontinuity of the step function type , the integral of the function @xmath182 will give the value of the limit of @xmath181 at the left of the point @xmath166 the right dirac delta @xmath183 is defined in a similar way , but with support of the form  @xmath184 , @xmath185 with all @xmath178 again positive .",
    "now let us consider the acceleration @xmath186 defined by the effective force in a sufficiently small open neighborhood @xmath187 of each instant @xmath188 the expression for it can be written in the form@xmath189 where the special heaviside like functions are defined as @xmath190 @xmath191therefore , let us search for the equation satisfied by this expression for the acceleration .",
    "the derivative of the acceleration within the neighborhood @xmath187 takes the form @xmath192    henceforth , after substituting this expression in ( [ modec ] ) , and considering that the ald equations are satisfied at the interior points of all the intervals @xmath193 it follows@xmath194    thus , all the terms in the above equations add to zero around each transition time @xmath195 .",
    "the first two lines line vanish because the trajectories solving the newton equations within each of the intervals @xmath196 also satisfy the ald equations within each neighborhood @xmath187except at the point @xmath195 .",
    "the last two terms also cancels between themselves since the delta functions allow to evaluate the argument of the functions multiplying them at their support point .",
    "therefore , after considering that the modifying terms of the ald equations vanish outside all the vicinities @xmath197  it follows that the limiting solution  along the whole axis satisfies the modified ald equations @xmath198      let us consider now the solution of the modified ald equations for the case of a exact squared pulse of the similar form as the before considered analytic one .",
    "the same initial conditions for the position and velocities will be fixed@xmath124    the newton equations in the interior points of any of the three intervals in which the time axis is decomposed by the two instants @xmath199 and @xmath200 have basically the same form as the equation ( [ newton2d ] ) @xmath201 where the force now defining the exact pulse of constant amplitude is given by the formula @xmath202 in which @xmath203 is the heaviside function .",
    "the width of the pulse was chosen as given by the same parameter @xmath87 defining the width of the analytically regularized pulse in past sections .",
    "the constant amplitude of the pulse @xmath204 will be approximately coinciding with the  height of the  regularized pulse , by selecting its magnitude as @xmath205 that is , by the height of the pulse at a time equal to  half of its approximate width @xmath87 .",
    "the parameters for the numerical evaluation will also coincide with values selected before  @xmath93 and @xmath206     the two evaluations tend to coincide . however , in the points close to the boundaries of this interval , the derivative of the acceleration associated to the analytic pulse develops peaked values .",
    "these peaked values gives account of the developing of the dirac functions entering the modified ald equations .",
    "the analytic solution , as obeying the exact ald along the whole axis should generate these dirac functions , in order to imply the modified equations in the limit.,width=434 ]    the solution of the equations ( [ newton2dpulse ] ) for the time dependence of the coordinate , velocity , acceleration and its time derivative ,  are jointly plotted in figure [ comparison ] , for both pulses : the one of exactly constant amplitude and the analytically regularized one .",
    "the plots evidence that these quantities are closely similar for both forces .",
    "a small difference starts to be noticed in the curve for the velocities .",
    "it shows that only in the close neighborhood of the transition points , in which the forces suddenly change , the rapid but smooth transition of the velocity for the  regularized pulse can be observed .",
    "further , the plot of the derivative of the acceleration is also presenting a difference .  for making the comparison clearer ,",
    "the plot associated to the derivative of the acceleration for the pulse of exact constant amplitude , is slightly shifted along the vertical axis away the zero values .",
    "this permits to note that the magnitude of the derivative of the acceleration at the interior points of the interval @xmath207 closely coincide for both solutions .",
    "however , near the transition points , the regularized pulse presents a peaked behavior .",
    "this is a numerical confirmation for the validity of the modified equations , since these peaked dependence are necessary for reproducing the dirac s delta functions entering these modified equations , in the limit when the regularized pulse tends to becomes the exactly constant one . that is , when",
    "the regularized pulse is gradually made to be even more similar to the constant pulse , it can be expected that the `` spikes '' appearing at the transition points for the derivatives of the acceleration , are associated to regularizations of the dirac s distributions .",
    "the enhancing of the peaks when the regularized pulse tends to be closer to the exact constant ones is illustrated in figure [ spikes ] .",
    "it shows the derivative of the acceleration for two solutions with almost all the parameters identical to the ones considered before , but differing only in the value determining the pulse rise time @xmath88 .",
    "the values selected for this parameters were @xmath93 cm and @xmath208 cm .",
    "that is , the pulse with @xmath93 will have a rising time two times smaller than the one with @xmath208 m. in the picture , there is a curve which shows the smaller peaks at the right and left of the figure , and the other one presents the higher peaks at both sides .",
    "the curve with the larger values is associated to the pulse @xmath93 and the curve with smaller values is related with the slower rising pulse .",
    "thus , it is clear that when the analytic pulse tends to approach the exactly constant one , the solution tends to show time derivatives with the appearance of  regularizations of the dirac s delta functions , as the it should be , if the modified ald equations are implied by the limit of the exact ald equations .",
    "the absence of the peaks in the solution linked with the square pulse is associate with the fact that the equations were solved at the interior points , and the boundary conditions are automatically satisfied across the two transition points , by the solutions of the newton equations in the three intervals .",
    "these boundary conditions were argued before to be equivalent to the presence of dirac delta functions with supports in the transition points .",
    "the work presents a second order newton like equations of motion for a radiating particle .",
    "it was argued that the trajectories obeying the equation exactly satisfy the abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equations .",
    "forces which only depend on the proper time were considered by now .",
    "a condition for these properties to occurs in a given time interval is derived : it is sufficient that the force becomes infinitely smooth and also that a particular series defined by the infinite sequence of its time derivatives converges to a bounded function .",
    "this series defines in a local way the effective force determining the newton effective equation .",
    "the existing solutions of such effective equations can not show the runaways or pre - acceleration phenomena .",
    "the newton equations were numerically solved for a pulsed like force given by an analytic function on the whole proper time axis .",
    "the satisfaction of the ald equations by the obtained solution is numerically checked .",
    "in addition , for the case of the collinear motions , it was derived a set of modified ald equations for almost infinitely smooth forces , which however , show step like discontinuities .",
    "the form of these equations supported the statement argued in a former work , about that the lienard - wiechert field surrounding a radiating particle should determine that the effective force on the particle instantaneously vanishes , when the external force is suddenly removed .",
    "the modified ald equations argued in the former study are here derived in a more general form , in which a suddenly applied external force is also instantly creating an effective non vanishing acceleration .",
    "the work is expected to be extended in some directions . by example , one issue which seems of interest to define is whether the class of external forces which also show well defined effective forces , constitutes a dense subset ( within an appropriate norm ) at least within the set of forces defined by continuous proper time functions .",
    "this property could help to understand , whether the ald equations , for any continuous time dependent force , could always exhibit a solution , which is also approximately solving second order newton equations , and then not showing pre - accelerated or runaway behavior .",
    "the authors would like to deeply acknowledge the helpful comments on the subject of this work received from danilo villarroel ( chile ) , jorge castieiras ( ufpa , brazil ) , luis carlos bassalo crispino ( ufpa , brazil ) and suvrat  raju  ( icts , tata institute , india ) .",
    "the support also received by both authors from the caribbean network on quantum mechanics , particles and fields ( net-35 ) of the ictp office of external activities ( oea ) and the  `` proyecto nacional de ciencias bsicas''(pncb ) of citma , cuba is also very much acknowledged ."
