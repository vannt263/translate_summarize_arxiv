    "the concept of current - carrying edge channels accounts for the magnetotransport properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a high magnetic field , both in the integer@xcite and fractional@xcite quantum hall regime .",
    "although the initial theoretical studies have used a noninteracting picture of edge channels , a considerable effort has recently been devoted to understand the effects of electron - electron interactions in the _ integer _ quantum hall regime.@xcite    at present there are two incompatible pictures for the electronic ground state of edge channels in the integer quantum hall regime . in the hartree - fock approximation",
    "the ground state wave function is a single slater determinant , which corresponds to occupation numbers zero and one.@xcite in this description the edge state is incompressible and the electron density drops rapidly at the edges , on a length scale which is typically of the order of the magnetic length .",
    "although the hartree - fock approximation is widely used for the description of quantum dots and wires,@xcite it has been challenged on the grounds that is does not take the global electrostatics into account properly.@xcite in the electrostatic description given in ref .",
    "a more gradual variation of the electron density at the edge is found energetically favorable . here",
    "the typical length scale for the density drop at the edge is of the order of the depletion length , which is much larger than the magnetic length . in this picture",
    "the electrons at the edge can screen the electrostatic confinement potential by a slow density variation and the edge states are therefore compressible .",
    "however , this description completely neglects the exchange interaction .",
    "a transition from incompressible to compressible edge states was already qualitatively discussed in ref .  , where a spontaneous transition from an unpolarized ( _ i.e. _ equal occupation for both spin levels ) to a polarized ( different occupation for different spin levels ) hartree - fock ground state was found for a critical confinement strength .",
    "it was speculated that a development to the electrostatic regime takes place as the confinement strength is decreased .",
    "more recently the transition between smoothly and abruptly varying density distributions has been studied by chamon and wen.@xcite on the basis of few particle exact solutions they predict formation of compressible edge states when the strength of the confinement potential is reduced beyond a certain point .",
    "their approach is difficult to extend to quantum wires or dots with a large number of electrons .    in the present work we interpolate between the different regimes of applicability of both hartree - fock and electrostatic pictures by extending the thomas - fermi approach used in ref . to a thomas - fermi-_dirac _ like treatment of the exchange effects in strong magnetic fields .",
    "first results of the present approach have been published in ref .  .",
    "very recently ferconi and vignale@xcite have studied the ground state energies and densities of a quantum dot in an arbitrary magnetic field , taking into account exchange - correlation effects by employing a kohn - sham scheme of current - density functional theory.@xcite for small quantum dots ( 2 or 3 electrons ) their method yields an accuracy better than 3% when compared with exact results . for a larger number of electrons and high magnetic fields",
    "we find that the kohn - sham formalism encounters serious problems .    in sec .",

    "let us consider first a quantum wire of the strictly two dimensional electron gas along the @xmath0  axis in the @xmath1  plane ( fig .",

    "is a uniform positive background charge which ensures global neutrality .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath0-direction and adopt the landau gauge so that @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the high magnetic field limit considered here only the lowest ( spin - up and spin - down ) landau levels are occupied .",
    "the wire is confined in the @xmath4  direction by a parabolic confinement potential : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dielectric constant and @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "we will ignore here the difference between the bare magnetic length @xmath8 and the magnetic length @xmath9 which is renormalized by the parabolic confinement potential : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the cyclotron frequency with @xmath12 the effective electron mass and @xmath13 characterizes the parabolic confinement potential @xmath14 .",
    "since we treat the problem numerically , the assumption of a parabolic form for the confinement is not essential : it is chosen here because it is widely used in the literature .",
    "all lengths will be given in units of @xmath15 throughout the paper unless otherwise indicated .",
    "we use density - functional theory in strong magnetic fields to find the electronic ground state of the system.@xcite without a magnetic field , the total energy of the system would be a functional of the electron density only . however , a magnetic field , apart from giving rise to zeeman splitting , causes orbital currents to flow in the electron gas , even when the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium . as a consequence ,",

    "[ fig : fillfact](c ) the confinement is still not strong enough to reduce the splitting to that of the bare zeeman splitting . in the case of even harder confinement ( @xmath83 ,  _ i.e. _  @xmath84  mev )",

    "note that the entire range from the electrostatic to the ( unpolarized ) hartree - fock regime can be realized in realistic confinement potentials with @xmath85 ranging from 3.4  mev to 5.3  mev .",

    "[ fig : potentials](b ) the same can be seen for the minority - spin electrons . in the figures",
    "the constant zeeman term has been omitted for simplicity so that the total potential is just the sum of the electrostatic and exchange potential .",
    "[ fig : potentials](a ) shows that for a majority spin electron the energetically most favourable position is near the edges .",
    "this is because these electrons are forced by exchange to form an electrostatically unfavourable density profile in which no screening of the confinement potential is possible , _",
    "i.e. _ the density of majority spin electrons is constant in the bulk of the wire .",
    "this in contrast to the minority spin electrons , for which the potential in the bulk is flat .",
    "this is due to the fact that these electrons still have the freedom to form a density distribution which can screen the external potential without being influenced much by the exchange interaction .",
    "the typical voltage drop from the edge to the middle of the wire has experimentally realistic values of @xmath87  300  mv for the bare confinement potential and @xmath87  30  mv for the selfconsistent potential .",
    "we also performed calculations of the widths of compressible and incompressible regions as a function of the confinement strength .",
    "the results are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetr ] where the widths of the outermost incompressible region ( i ) and innermost compressible region ( c ) have been plotted as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "if no incompressible strip is present in the middle of the wire , c is defined as half the width of the total compressible middle region ( see inset ) . in the figure",
    "the points do not always lie on the smooth curve which serves as a guide for the eye .",
    "this is due to the spacing between sampling points ( 0.2  @xmath15 ) , which imposes a upper bound on the accuracy of the calculated widths .",
    "the compressible strip shrinks rapidly as the confinement is increased but if the width has reached a value of roughly a few magnetic lengths , the further decrease becomes very slow and in practice we always find a small but finite compressible region .",
    "it is clear , however , that a hartree - fock treatment should give good results for hard confinements where small compressible regions exist .",
    "we recover the spin - polarizing transition of ref .   since the incompressible strip between spin - up and spin - down channels ( i in fig .  [ fig : phasetr ] ) drops to zero at a certain critical value of the confinement strength ( neglecting zeeman splitting ) .",
    "both the value for the critical confinement strength and the overall shape of the curve agree well with the results of ref .  .",
    "an important consequence of exchange on the distribution of electrons for experiments is the increased separation between the compressible regions .",
    "this causes a strong decrease in inter - edge channel scattering because of the reduced overlap of the edge - channel wave functions , which leads to an increase in the spin - flip equilibration length of the edge channels .",
    "this in contrast to the assumption of an edge channel separation of the order of one magnetic length in ref .  .",
    "using a typical edge channel separation of a few magnetic lengths in accordance with the present results , khaetskii s theory@xcite would give a much longer equilibration length .",

    "they obtain conductance quantization but , due to the small width of the incompressible regions , the calculated plateau widths are much smaller than those experimentally observed .",
    "they attribute this discrepancy between theory and experiment to the presence of disorder .",
    "however , we propose as an alternative explanation the electronic exchange interaction which we find to strongly enhance the width of the insulating strips .",
    "in this subsection we study the accuracy of our theory and how our present results are altered if we take into account realistic features which do not change the qualitative results but are important to describe experimental situations .",
    "first we investigate the validity of eq .",
    "( [ convolution ] ) for high magnetic fields where mixing with higher landau levels was disregarded . to this end",
    "we use a parabolic confinement @xmath14 and a density distribution of the form : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the width of the wire .",
    "the 2deg in the presence of the uniform magnetic field and parabolic confinement potential is our unperturbed system and we treat the hartree potential as a perturbation .",
    "the energy levels of the unperturbed system are @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the renormalized cyclotron frequency and @xmath92 is the renormalized electron mass : @xmath93 .",
    "the wave functions are the bulk landau level wave functions with effective magnetic length @xmath94.@xcite according to first order perturbation theory , the ground state wave function , @xmath95 , of the electron at the edge , with quantum number @xmath96 , is approximately : @xmath97 where we have used the hartree potential as the perturbation . a straightforward calculation of the coefficient of @xmath98 ( which of course depends on @xmath89 ) shows that for @xmath99 , a magnetic field of 5  t and a typical value of @xmath100  mev for the parabolic confinement , the mixing with the first landau level wave function is approximately 10% and that this value decreases as @xmath101 with increasing magnetic field .",
    "we have to conclude that the dip in the electrostatic , _ i.e. _ hartree and confinement , potential at the edges which is responsible for the spin - polarizing transition and ultimately for the compressible edge state , can not be compensated by mixing with higher landau levels , _",
    "i.e. _ that our approximation is allowed in the high magnetic field limit considered here .",
    "by performing a similar calculation it is possible to show that the mixing due the exchange - correlation potential used by ferconi and vignale@xcite is only a few percent .",
    "another approximation which gives rise to quantitative deviations from our theory is the assumption that the electron gas is strictly two dimensional . in reality",
    "the electron wave functions also extend in the @xmath102-direction and a form factor @xmath103 in the coulomb interaction , @xmath104 , takes this effect into account .",
    "calculations of edge channel splitting including a form factor in the hartree - fock approximation have already been calculated by rijkels and bauer.@xcite by comparison with ref .",
    "we estimate the values of @xmath7 to decrease by about 0.004 if a form factor would be included into our calculations .",
    "this shifts the range of @xmath85 in which both the electrostatic and the hartree - fock regime are unreliable to lower energies , _ i.e. _ to 3.2  mev-5.1  mev .",
    "the present theory can be easily generalized to a variety of systems . in the next subsections we consider two special cases , which are experimentally relevant .      as a first application we have carried out calculations for a system like the one considered in sec .  [",
    "sec : system ] , but now in the presence of an infinite plane of constant potential at a distance @xmath105 from the 2deg , which may represent a real back gate or a plane of not fully depleted donors parallel to the 2deg .",
    "this gate can be easily included into the calculations by adding the potential of a mirror charge distribution of opposite sign located at a distance @xmath106 from the electron gas : @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nubackgate ] we have plotted the solutions that minimize the total energy of the system including the back gate as a function of the distance @xmath105 to the wire for a given number of electrons and a fixed confinement potential .    it is clear from the figure that moving the back gate closer to the 2deg has the effect of reducing the width of the compressible regions .",
    "this is to be expected because the back gate screens the long - range coulomb interaction in the electron gas , thus effectively reducing the importance of the direct interaction relative to the exchange interaction and thereby forcing the solution for small distances @xmath105 into the hartree - fock regime .",
    "it should be noted that the description of the back gate given here does not apply for a quantum wire defined by a depletion gate . in that case",
    "the back gate would also screen the charge on the depletion gates , thus increasingly altering the confinement potential as the back gate is moved closer to the 2deg . in that case",
    "a fully self - consistent calculation is necessary .",
    "furthermore , for our results to be correct , the distance from the gate to the 2deg should not be too small since in that case also the short - range exchange interaction would be influenced by the gate .",
    "a system that is very similar to the strip previously considered is a quantum dot in a high magnetic field , especially when the number of electrons in the dot is large .",
    "there are two main differences . in the first place we use the symmetric gauge to describe the dot . in this gauge",
    "the wave functions in the lowest landau level , labeled by the quantum number of angular momentum , are @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "the second difference is that because the system is finite the filling factor @xmath110 is no longer labeled by the continuous variable @xmath69 but by the discrete quantum number @xmath111 . as a consequence the radial symmetric density is now given by : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the filling factor for a given angular momentum @xmath111 and spin direction @xmath24 .",
    "we impose as boundary conditions that @xmath114 and that the total charge in one spin level @xmath115 is an integer . due to the circular symmetry of the dot",
    "the hartree potential is in this case given by : @xmath116    an analysis analogous to the one presented in sec .",

    "fractional occupation numbers are essential , which can not be described by the kohn - sham scheme of ref .  .",
    "we have calculated the ground state of a dot consisting of 40 electrons using a parabolic confinement potential @xmath117 with varying strength @xmath7 in a magnetic field of 5.0  t. to find the ground state for a given magnetic field we vary the distribution of electrons among the occupied spin levels while keeping the total number of electrons constant .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuqdot ] .",
    "the ground states are similar to those of the strip except for the fact that the middle region is wider .",
    "this is due to the fact that the wave functions are centered around the radii @xmath118 , where @xmath111 is the angular momentum index , and not around equidistant points like in the strip .    in ref .",
    "a selfconsistent calculation was performed for the density profile of a quantum dot containing 39 electrons using a modified hartree form for the electrostatic electron - electron interaction : @xmath119 thus taking into account the finite @xmath102-extent @xmath120 of the wave functions and a back gate at distance @xmath105 .",
    "again we want to extend these calculations to include exchange but we must keep in mind that a finite @xmath121 also reduces the exchange interaction by a form factor : @xmath122 where @xmath121 is given in units of the magnetic length and @xmath123x@xmath124 denotes the complementary error function . a calculation using interaction eq .",
    "( [ veemceuen ] ) and the local exchange contribution reduced by the form factor eq .",
    "( [ formfactor ] ) gives a ground state which differs from that of mceuen  _ et al .",
    "_ in the sense that the widths of the incompressible ( compressible ) regions are larger ( smaller ) in our solution .",
    "we have calculated the addition spectrum of dots consisting of 37 and 38 electrons in order to determine the effect of exchange on the inter - level transitions that are responsible for the oscillatory behavior of the addition energy . here",
    "we take into account the fact that the magnetic length is renormalised by the magnetic field , eq .",
    "( [ renmaglen ] ) , in order to compare the energies at different magnetic fields .",
    "the addition energy @xmath125 needed for adding an extra electron to a dot of @xmath40 electrons is : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the total energy given by eq .",
    "( [ totenergy ] ) .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : addition ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that our results are very close to the hartree - fock solutions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the combination of the back gate and exchange force the solution into the integer filling regime .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : addition ] shows the energy dependence of different dot configurations with magnetic field for a dot containing 39 electrons .",
    "the ground state is formed by the configuration with lowest energy .",
    "the numbers in the inset represent the number of electrons in the majority ( _ i.e. _ lowest ) spin level for the indicated curve . as the magnetic field increases , the degeneracy of the spin levels is increased and at certain magnetic fields an electron can jump from the upper to the lower level , causing the kinks in the ground state energy .",
    "when all electrons are in the lowest spin level no transitions can occur and the curves for both the total and addition energy are smooth .",
    "recent calculations@xcite and measurements@xcite indicate that at higher magnetic fields than the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : addition ] an edge reconstruction occurs , resulting in an extra kink in the curve for the addition energy in the regime where only one spin level is occupied . performing a calculation with filling factors that are restricted to integer values , we are able to reproduce this feature",
    ". however , for the small confinement strength @xmath7 at which this transition occurs , the fractional - filling solution is not so well converged . in spite of the fact that we find evidence for the edge reconstruction",
    ", the numerical accuracy of our solution does not allow decisive conlusions .    in comparison with the results obtained in ref .",
    "the oscillations found in our calculations have a larger period and amplitude by a factor of approximately 1.5 .",
    "the increase in amplitude of the oscillations can be qualitatively understood in terms of the capacitance model for the island proposed by evans  _ et al._@xcite and is due to the increase of the width of the incompressible strip in the picture including exchange .",
    "this results in a decrease of the capacitance between the inner and outer compresible regions where the extra electron can be added and hence in an increase in the peak - to - peak amplitude . the larger period can be explained in a similar fashion : exchange effects reduce the widths of the compressible strips and thus the capacitances @xmath128 and @xmath129 between the respective compressible strips and the back gate which results in an increased period of the oscillations compared to the electrostatic treatment of mceuen  _ et al._. compared with their experimental data , the period of the oscillations found in our calculations is about 0.3  t too large whereas their calculations give a period which is 0.25  t too small .",
    "however , these values depend sensitively on the calculated ground state density since the total energy , with a typical value around 1  ev , has to be calculated with an absolute accuracy of at least 0.1  mev in order to resolve the oscillations and therefore small numerical deviations from the true ground state would drastically influence the addition energies .",
    "we have used density - functional theory in strong magnetic fields to investigate the effects of the electron - electron interaction on edge states in the integer quantum hall regime .",
    "we have included exchange in the local density approximation . in this approximation smooth density distributions corresponding to fractional filling at the edges",
    "can be treated , which is beyond a hartree - fock treatment of edge channels.@xcite to describe fractional occupation could otherwise only be achieved by exact diagonalization or configuration interaction calculations.@xcite we have found that the width of the edge channels is strongly reduced due to exchange effects and that the width of the incompressible strips is of the order of several magnetic lengths , which should have a strong influence on the spin - flip equilibration length and the two - terminal conductance of a point contact .",
    "we predict a range of confinement potentials @xmath85=3.2  mev-5.1  mev in which the entire regime from electrostatic to hartree - fock is covered .",
    "furthermore we have calculated ground state properties of the system in the presence of a back gate parallel to the quantum wire .",
    "we established an increasingly important role for the exchange interaction as the back gate is closed in on the 2deg .",
    "as a second application we have calculated the ground state of a quantum dot in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we found that the results are similar to those found for the quantum wire .",
    "we compared addition energies for the dot with the selfconsistent calculations of mceuen  _ et al._@xcite and found that the oscillations in the addition energies have larger amplitudes and periods in our calculations .",
