    "<S> such a possibility was recently demonstrated for the so - called anapole mode , which is associated with zero electric dipole scattering . by overlapping magnetic dipole resonance with the anapole mode </S>",
    "<S> we achieve ideal magnetic dipole scattering in the far - field with tunable high scattering resonances in near infrared spectrum . </S>",

    "<S> the responses of such materials to the magnetic component of light is usually negligible at frequencies above a few terahertz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , realization of effective optical magnetism is very crucial for designing functional metamaterials working at this spectrum range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optical mie resonances in dielectric nanoparticles with high refractive indices provide a platform for studying magnetic light - matter interaction mediated by their optical induced magnetic resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a nanoparticle supports a magnetic dipole ( md ) mode which resembles a circular displacement current distribution in the near - field and therefore manifests itself as a md scatter in the far - field . to date , various promising functions have been demonstrated via involving md modes , such as directional scattering of light @xcite , fano resonances @xcite , enhanced optical nonlinearity @xcite , nonradiate anapole @xcite , subwavelength topological edge states @xcite , purcell factor enhancements @xcite , and metasurface @xcite etc .    in general , the resonant frequencies of electric dipole ( ed ) and md modes in silicon nanoparticles ( sns ) are shifted with respect to each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus , they spectraly overlap in quite significant region , making sn as a dressed md scatter @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , they can exhibit various interference effects in the far - field , leading to the unidirectional fano resonant scattering of light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to unambiguously study the md scattering , it is necessary to suppress the electric dipole and all higher - order multipoles . </S>",
    "<S> such kind of exotic ideal md scatterer would be extremely useful for the study of _ magnetic light - matter interaction_.    regarding a sn , the conditions to realize an ideal md scatter are the solutions of the following equation set ( details can be found in the supplemental material @xcite ) :    </S>",

    "<S> it can be understood due to the fact that these two parameters are related to each other via so - called size parameter @xmath9 and by simply changing the radius of sn will simultaneously shift the resonances of the ed and md along the same spectrum direction and the spectrum overlap between ed and md is always preserved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but , in general , there is a possibility to achieve an ideal md scattering via overlap the md mode with the nonradiated anapole mode which had been demonstrated very recently in sns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been proved that such anapole can be effectively tuned in ag core / silicon shell nanoparticle to realize scattering transparency @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , we introduce the concept of _ ideal md scatter scattering _ whose ed and high order electric and magnetic multipoles are negligible at the resonant frequency of md . </S>",
    "<S> such suppression is based on the excitation of the anapole mode , which is a result of the destructive interference between cartesian ed and toroidal dipole ( td ) modes @xcite , in an au core / silicon shell nanoparticle . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there are two ed modes in this hybrid system and their interaction can be used to shift the resonant frequency of the anapole mode to overlap with the md mode . </S>",
