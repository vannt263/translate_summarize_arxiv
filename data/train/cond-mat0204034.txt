    "few quantities in physics play such a singular role in their theories as the entropy in the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) formulation of statistical mechanics : it provides , in an elegant and simple way , the fundamental link between the microscopic structure of a system and its macroscopic behavior .",
    "almost two decades ago , tsallis @xcite proposed the following entropy expression as a nonextensive generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) formalism for statistical mechanics , @xmath0^q } { q-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a constant , @xmath2 a parameter and @xmath3 a probability distribution over the phase space variables @xmath4 . instead of the usual bg exponential , upon maximization with a fixed average energy constraint , the above entropy gives a power - law distribution , @xmath5^{\\frac{1}{q-1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a temperature - like parameter and @xmath7 is the energy of the system . in the limit @xmath8 ,",
    "the above expressions reduce to the familiar bg forms of entropy , @xmath9 , and exponential distribution @xmath10 .",
    "the consequences of this generalization are manifold and far - reaching ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) , but its most notorious one is certainly the fact that @xmath11 , along with other thermodynamical quantities , are _ nonextensive _ for @xmath12 .    whether such formalism can be verified experimentally or elucidated from any previously established theoretical framework are obvious questions that arise naturally .",
    "the answer to the first one seems to be affirmative , as there are currently numerous references to systems that are better described within the generalized approach of tsallis than with the traditional bg formalism @xcite , the underlying argument being usually based on a best fit to either numerical or experimental data by choosing an appropriate value for the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this is , by far , the most frequent approach towards tsallis distribution and is surely not conclusive .",
    "its justification from first principles , although already addressed at different levels in previous studies @xcite , is nevertheless controversial and still represents an open research issue . for example , it has been recently suggested that systems in contact with finite heat baths should follow the thermostatistics of tsallis @xcite .",
    "this derivation , however , relies on a particular _ ansatz _ for the density of states of the bath and lacks a more direct connection with the entropy , as pointed out in ref .",
    "also , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the tsallis statistics , together with the biased averaging scheme , can be mapped into the conventional boltzmann - gibbs statistics by a redefinition of variables that results from the scaling properties of the tsallis entropy .    in a recent study @xcite , a derivation of the generalized canonical distribution",
    "is presented from first principles statistical mechanics .",
    "it is shown that the particular features of a macroscopic subunit of the canonical system , namely , the heat bath , determines the nonextensive signature of its thermostatistics .",
    "more precisely , it is exactly demonstrated that if one specifies the heat bath to satisfy the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a temperature - like parameter and @xmath15 is the thermodynamic temperature , the form of the distribution eq .  ( [ phasedist ] ) is recovered @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ q - eq ] ) is essentially equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ phasedist ] ) .",
    "however , it reveals a direct connection between the finite aspect of the many - particle system and the generalized @xmath2-statistics @xcite .",
    "it is analogous to state that , if the condition of an infinite heat bath capacity is violated , the resulting canonical distribution can no longer be of the exponential type and therefore should not follow the traditional bg thermostatistics .",
    "inspired by these results , we propose here a theoretical approach for the thermostatistics of tsallis that is entirely based on standard methods of statistical mechanics .",
    "subsequently , we will not only recover the previous observation that an adequate physical setting for the tsallis formalism should be found in the physics of finite systems , but also derive a novel and exact correspondence between the hamiltonian structure of a system and its closed - form @xmath2-distribution , supporting our findings through a specific numerical experiment .",
    "we start by considering , in a shell of constant energy , a system whose hamiltonian can be written as a sum of two parts , viz .",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and so on . the fact that tsallis distribution is a power - law instead of exponential strongly suggests us to look for scale - invariant forms of hamiltonians @xcite . furthermore , since scale - invariant hamiltonians constitute a particular case of homogeneous functions @xcite , our approach here is to show that , if @xmath21 satisfies a generalized homogeneity relation of the type @xmath22 where @xmath23 are non - null real constants , then the correct statistics for @xmath24 is the one proposed by tsallis .",
    "the foregoing derivation is based on a simple scaling argument , but we shall draw parallels to ref .",
    "@xcite whenever appropriate .",
    "the structure function ( density of states ) for @xmath21 at the energy level @xmath7 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the volume element in the subspace spanned by @xmath27 .",
    "for systems satisfying equation  ( [ homog - rel ] ) , this function can be evaluated taking @xmath28 and computing @xmath29 where we define @xmath30 and utilize the notation @xmath31 , @xmath32 , etc . , and @xmath33 hence ,",
    "if @xmath34 is defined at a value @xmath35 , it is also defined at every @xmath36 , with @xmath28 .",
    "we can then write @xmath37 and express the canonical distribution law over the phase space of @xmath38 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total energy of the joint system composed by @xmath38 and @xmath21 , and @xmath41 is its structure function , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the infinitesimal volume elements of the phase spaces of @xmath38 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ phasedist - new ] ) with the distribution in the form of eq .",
    "( [ phasedist ] ) , we get the following relation between @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath40 : @xmath45 notice that one could reach exactly the same result using the methodology proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. by evaluating @xmath46 at @xmath47 , calculating @xmath48 through eq .",
    "( [ q - eq ] ) and inserting these quantities back in eq .",
    "( [ phasedist ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , previous studies have shown that the distribution of tsallis eq .",
    "( [ phasedist ] ) is compatible with some anomalous `` canonical '' configurations where the heat bath is finite @xcite or composes a peculiar type of extended phase - space dynamics @xcite . in our approach",
    ", the observation of tsallis distribution simply reflects the finite size of a thermal environment with the property ( [ homog - rel ] ) , the thermodynamical limit corresponding to @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ q - micro ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that , although similar conclusions could be drawn from refs .",
    "@xcite , the theoretical framework introduced here permits us to put forward a rigorous realization of the @xmath2-thermostatistics : it stems from the _ weak _ coupling of a system to a `` heat bath '' whose hamiltonian is a homogeneous function of its coordinates , _ the value of @xmath2 being completely determined by its degree of homogeneity , eq .",
    "( [ q - micro])_. this provides also a direct correspondence between the parameter @xmath2 and the hamiltonian structure through geometrical elements of its phase space , viz .",
    "the surfaces of constant energy @xmath50 .    as a specific application of the above results ,",
    "we investigate the form of the momenta distribution law for a classical @xmath51-body problem in @xmath52-dimensions .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as @xmath53 where we define @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the linear momentum vector of an arbitrary particle @xmath56 ( hence the number of degrees of freedom of the system @xmath57 is @xmath58 ) , and @xmath21 ( the `` bath '' ) is due to a homogeneous potential @xmath59 of degree @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 with @xmath62 . at this point , we emphasize that the distinction between `` system '' and `` bath '' is merely formal and does not necessarily involve a physical boundary .",
    "it relies solely on the fact that we can decompose the total hamiltonian in two parts @xcite . by making the correspondences @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath58 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the homogeneity relation ( [ homog - rel ] )",
    "is satisfied . from eq .",
    "( [ phasedist - new ] ) it then follows that @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{q-1}},\\ ] ] where the nonextensivity measure @xmath2 is given by @xmath69 it is often argued that the range of the forces should play a fundamental role in deciding between the bg or tsallis formalisms to describe the thermostatistics of an @xmath51-body system @xcite .",
    "for example , the scaling properties of the one - dimensional ising model with long - range interaction has been investigated analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite in the context of tsallis thermostatistics , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite a rigorous approach was adopted to study the nonextensivity of a more general class of long - range systems in the thermodynamic limit ( see below ) .",
    "recall that , for a @xmath52-dimensional system , an interaction is said to be long - ranged if @xmath70 . within this regime , the thermostatistics of tsallis",
    "is expected to apply , while for @xmath71 the system should follow the standard bg behavior @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is not confirmed by the results of the problem at hand .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ phasedist - f ] ) is consistent with the generalized @xmath2-distribution eq .",
    "( [ phasedist ] ) no matter what the value of @xmath60 is , as long as it is non - null and @xmath51 is finite . in the limit @xmath72 , however , we always get @xmath73 , with the value of @xmath60 determining the shape of the curve @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath75 , @xmath2 approaches the value @xmath57 from above , while for @xmath76 the value of @xmath2 is always less than @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , for ( ergodic ) classical systems with @xmath51 particles interacting through a homogeneous potential , the _ equilibrium _ distribution of momenta always goes to the boltzmann distribution , @xmath77 $ ] , when @xmath72 . this observation should be confronted with the recent results of vollmayr - lee and luijten @xcite , who investigated the nonextensivity of long - range ( therein `` nonintegrable '' ) systems with algebraically decaying interactions through a rigorous kac - potential technique .",
    "contrary to the trend established by the practitioners of tsallis formalism , those authors argue that it is possible to obtain the nonextensive scaling relations of tsallis without resorting to an a priori @xmath2-statistics , the boltzmann - gibbs prescription ( @xmath78 ) being sufficient for describing long - range systems of the type above . even though our findings embody partially the same message ( we are not yet concerned about scaling relations ) ,",
    "there are some caveats that prevent their results from being straightforwardly applicable to our problem : neither a system - size regulator for the energy nor a cutoff function is present in our treatment .",
    "this is immediately in contrast with their observation that the `` bulk '' thermodynamics strongly depends on the functional form of the regulator .",
    "moreover , by not addressing the distribution function explicitly at finite system sizes , that work has very little in common with the most interesting part of our study , which might in fact explain some observations of the @xmath2-distribution .",
    "notwithstanding these differences , we believe that an investigation of the scaling properties of the system studied here would elucidate from a different perspective the connection of tsallis thermostatistics with nonextensivity and is certainly a very welcome endeavor .",
    "it is important to stress here that the essential feature determining the canonical distribution is the geometry of the phase space region that is effectively visited by the system . in a previous work by latora",
    "@xcite , the dynamics of a classical system of @xmath51 spins with infinitely long - range interaction is investigated through numerical simulations , and the results indicate that if the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath79 ) is taken before the infinite - time limit ( @xmath80 ) , the system does not relax to the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium . instead",
    ", it displays anomalous behavior characterized by stable non - gaussian velocity distributions and dynamical correlation in phase space",
    ". this might be due to the appearance of metastable state regions that have a fractal nature with low dimension . in our theoretical approach , however , it is assumed that _ the infinite - time limit is taken before the thermodynamic limit_. as a consequence , metastable or quasi - stationary states like the ones observed by latora _",
    "@xcite with a particular long - range hamiltonian system can not be predicted within the framework of our methodology .",
    "whether this type of dynamical behavior can be generally and adequately described in term of the nonextensive thermostatistics of tsallis still represents an open question of great scientific interest .",
    "in order to corroborate our method , we investigate through numerical simulation the statistical properties of a linear chain of anharmonic oscillators .",
    "besides the kinetic term , the hamiltonian includes both on - site and nearest - neighbors quartic potentials , i.e. @xmath81 the choice of this system is inspired by the so - called fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) problem , originally devised to test whether statistical mechanics is capable or not to describe dynamical systems with a small number of particles @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ hamilt - osc ] ) , we obtain the equations of motion and integrate them numerically together with the following set of initial conditions : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a random number within @xmath84 .",
    "undoubtedly , a rigorous analysis concerning the ergodicity of this dynamical system would be advisable before adopting the fpu chain as a plausible case study .",
    "this represents a formidable task , even for such a simple problem @xcite . for our practical purposes",
    ", it suffices , however , to test if the system displays equipartition among its linear momentum degrees of freedom , since this is one of the main signatures of ergodic systems .",
    "indeed , one can show from the so - called birkhoff - khinchin ergodic theorem that , for ( almost ) all trajectories @xcite , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the volume of the phase space with @xmath87 , @xmath88 denotes the the usual time average of an observable @xmath89 , and @xmath90 stands for the absolute temperature of the _ whole system _ , @xmath91 ( cf .",
    "we then follow the time evolution of the quantities @xmath92 to check if they approach unity as @xmath93 increases . from the results of our simulations with different values of @xmath51 and several sets of initial conditions , we observe in all cases the asymptotic behavior ,",
    "@xmath94 as @xmath95 .",
    "this procedure also indicates a good estimate for the relaxation time of the system , @xmath96 , so we shall consider our statistical data only for @xmath97 , with a typical observation time in the range @xmath98 , after thermalization .     as a function of the transformed variable @xmath99 for @xmath100 ( circles ) , @xmath101 ( triangles up ) , @xmath102 ( squares ) , and @xmath103 ( triangles down ) anharmonic oscillators .",
    "the solid straight lines are the best fit to the simulation data of the expected power - law behavior eq .",
    "( [ phasedist - f ] ) .",
    "the slopes are 1.0068 ( 1.0 ) , 3.07 ( 3.0 ) , 7.21 ( 7.0 ) , and 15.27 ( 15.0 ) for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , respectively , and the numbers in parentheses indicate the expected values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ q - nbody ] ) .",
    "the departure from the power - law behavior at the extremes of the curves is due to finite - time sampling . ]    in fig .  1 we show the logarithmic plot of the distribution @xmath104 against the transformed variable @xmath99 for systems with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 oscillators . based on the above result , we assume ergodicity and compute the distribution of momenta from the fluctuations in time of @xmath105 through the relation @xmath106 where the @xmath107 factor accounts for the degeneracy of the momenta consistent with the magnitude of @xmath38 ( cf .",

    "of course , we do not expect that our approach can explain the whole spectrum of problems in which tsallis statistics can be applied .",
