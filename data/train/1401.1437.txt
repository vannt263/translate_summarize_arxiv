    "interstellar dust is of primary importance in determining the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the radiation escaping from galaxies at wavelengths ranging from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the submillimetre ( submm ) and radio .",
    "dust attenuates and redistributes the light , originating mainly from stars and , if present , from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , by either absorbing or scattering photons .",
    "the absorbed luminosity is then re - emitted in the infrared regime .",
    "the dust may be situated in complex geometries with respect to these sources , affecting the observed structure of the galaxy at each wavelength as well as its integrated sed .",
    "modeling the propagation of light within real galaxies is thus a challenging task .",
    "nevertheless , it is essential to do such modeling , if physical quantities of interest , such as the distribution and properties of the stellar populations and the interstellar medium ( ism ) as traced by dust and the interstellar radiation fields , are to be derived from multiwavelength images and seds . + taking advantage of the approximate cylindrical symmetry of galaxies , 2d dust radiative transfer ( rt ) models , such as the one presented by popescu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , already contain the main ingredients needed to predict integrated galaxy seds , average profiles , dust emission and attenuation for the case of normal star - forming disc galaxies .",
    "however , there are a number of reasons why 3d dust rt codes are desirable . first",
    ", spiral galaxies , although well modeled with 2d codes , show the presence of multiple and irregular features such as spiral structures , bars , warps and local clumpiness of the ism .",
    "also , galaxies may host a central agn whose polar axis may not be aligned with that of the galaxy . for mergers or post - merger galaxies",
    "there is clearly no fundamental symmetry of the distribution of stars and dust .",
    "finally , solutions for the distribution of stars and ism provided by numerical simulations of forming and evolving galaxies generally require processing with a 3d rt code in order to predict the appearance in different bands .",
    "+ the main challenge in realizing 3d solutions of the dust rt problem is the computational expense .",
    "the stationary 3d dust rt equation is a non - local non - linear equation : non - local in space ( photons propagate within the entire domain ) , direction ( due to scattering , absorption / re - emission ) and wavelength ( absorption / re - emission ) . even using a relatively coarse resolution in each of the six fundamental variables , namely the three spatial coordinates , the two angles specifying the radiation direction and the wavelength , solving the 3d dust rt problem require an impressive amount of both memory and computational speed , at the limits of the capabilities of current computers .",
    "+ possibly the quickest way to calculate an image of a galaxy in direct and scattered light in a particular direction is by using monte carlo ( mc ) methods ( including modern acceleration techniques , see steinacker et al .",
    "there is a rich history of applications of mc codes to dust rt problems , starting with the pioneering works of e.g. mattila ( 1970 ) , roark , roark & collins ( 1974 ) , witt & stephens ( 1974 ) and witt ( 1977 ) . in the following decades",
    "the mc rt technique was further developed by many authors such as e.g. witt , thronson & capuano ( 1992 ) , fischer , henning & yorke ( 1994 ) , bianchi , ferrara & giovanardi ( 1996 ) , witt & gordon ( 1996 ) and dullemond & turolla ( 2000 ) .",
    "nowadays , this method can be considered as the mainstream approach to 3d dust rt calculations ( see e.g. gordon et al .",
    "2001 , ercolano et al .",
    "2005 , jonsson 2006 , bianchi 2008 , chakrabarti & whitney 2009 , baes et al .",
    "2011 , robitaille 2011 , but also see table 1 of steinacker et al .",
    "2013 for a recent list of published 3d dust rt codes ) .",
    "the mc approach to dust rt consists of a simulation of the propagation of photons within a discretized spatial domain , based on a probabilistic determination of the location of emission of the photons , their initial propagation direction , the position where an interaction event ( absorption or scattering ) occurs and the new propagation direction after a scattering event .",
    "thus , the mc technique mimics closely the actual processes occurring in nature which shape the appearance of galaxies in uv / optical light .",
    "however , since it is based on a probabilistic approach to determine the photon propagation directions , an rt mc calculation does not necessarily determine the radiation field energy density ( rfed ) accurately in the entire volume of the calculation .",
    "the reason is that regions which have a low probability of being illuminated are reached by only few photons unless the total number of photons in the rt run is substantially increased",
    ". nonetheless , in the case of disc galaxies , accurate calculation of radiation field intensities throughout the entire volume is needed , in particular for the calculation of dust emission . indeed ,",
    "far - infrared / submm observations of spiral galaxies show that most of the dust emission luminosity is emitted longwards of 100@xmath0 m ( see e.g. sodroski et al .",
    "1997 , odenwald et al .",
    "1998 , popescu et al .",
    "2002 , popescu & tuffs 2002 , dale et al .",
    "2007 , 2012 , bendo et al . 2012 ) through grains situated in the diffuse ism which are generally located at very considerable distances from the stars heating the dust .",
    "another method to solve the rt problem in galaxies , alternative to the mainstream mc approach , is by using a ray - tracing algorithm .",
    "this method consists in the calculation of the variation of the radiation specific intensity along a finite set of directions , usually referred to as `` rays '' .",
    "ray - tracing algorithms can be specifically designed to calculate radiation field intensities throughout the entire volume considered in the rt calculation .",
    "also , it should be pointed out that mc codes already make large use of ray - tracing operations ( see steinacker et al .",
    "it is thus interesting to pursue in the developing of pure ray - tracing 3d rt codes , which can be sufficiently efficient for the modelling of galaxies with 3d arbitrary geometries , if appropriate acceleration techniques are implemented .",
    "similar to mc codes , ray - tracing dust rt codes have had a rich history in astrophysics ( see e.g. hummer & rybicki 1971 , rowan - robinson 1980 , efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1990 , siebenmorgen et al .",
    "1992 , semionov & vansevicius 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "application to analysis of galaxies started with the 2d code of kylafis & bahcall ( 1987 ) .",
    "although originally implemented only for the calculation of optical images ( see also xilouris et al .",
    "1997 , 1998,1999 ) , this algorithm was later adapted by popescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the calculation of radiation fields and was coupled with a dust emission model ( including stochastic heating of grains ) to predict the full mid - infrared ( mir)/fir / submm sed of spiral galaxies ( see also misiriotis et al .",
    "2001 , popescu et al .",
    "thus far , extensions of the ray - tracing technique to 3d have been implemented but are specifically designed for solving the rt problem for star forming clouds ( e.g. steinacker et al .",
    "2003 , kuiper et al .",
    "2010 ) , heated by few dominant discrete sources , rather than for very extended distributions of emission and dust as encountered in galaxies .",
    "+ in this paper , we present dart - ray , a new ray - tracing algorithm which is optimized for the solution of the 3d dust rt problem for galaxies with arbitrary geometries and moderate optical depth at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "the main challenge faced by this model is the construction of an efficient algorithm for the placing of rays throughout the volume of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , a complete ray - tracing calculation between all the cells , used to discretise a model , is not a viable option , since it is by far too computationally expensive even for relatively coarse spatial resolution .",
    "our algorithm circumvents the problem by performing an appropriate pre - calculation , whose goal is to provide a lower limit to the rfed distribution throughout the model . in this way",
    ", the ray angular density needed in the actual rt calculation can be dynamically adjusted such that the ray contributions to the local rfed are calculated only within the fraction of the volume where these contributions are not going to be negligible .",
    "+ furthermore , the code we developed can be coupled with any dust emission model .",
    "applications of the 3d code for calculation of infrared emission from stochastically heated dust grains of various sizes and composition , including heating of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons molecules , utilizes the dust emission model from popescu et al .",

    "for most practical applications to large statistical samples of galaxies ( e.g. driver et al .",

    "2011 , grootes et al .",
    "2013 ) , rt modelling of the observed spatially integrated direct and dust - reradiated starlight necessarily ( in the absence of detailed images ) adopts 2d axisymmetric approximation of the distribution of stars and dust .",
    "however , the distribution of light at uv and short optical wavelengths from young massive stars is well known in real galaxies to be biased towards a spiral pattern of enhanced dust density , rather than the smooth exponential disc function typically assumed by these models .",
    "the question therefore arises whether this effect introduces any systematic bias into 2d model predictions of dust attenuation of integrated starlight and averaged rfed in spiral galaxies . to evaluate this bias ,",
    "we have performed a rt calculation for a galaxy model including logarithmic spiral arms .",
    "we considered a typical model galaxy from p11 , consisting of a disc with @xmath3 and a thin stellar disc with @xmath4 , and two dust discs with @xmath5 ( see sect .",
    "5.2 for a description of the model parameters of p11 ) .",
    "we modified this model using the same procedure as that adopted in p11 for the inclusion of circular spiral arms .",
    "thus , we considered the same double exponential distribution for the thick stellar and dust disc but we redistributed the thin disc stellar luminosity and dust mass within spiral arms .",
    "as shown in schechtman - rook et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the implementation of logarithmic spiral arms can be done by multiplying a logarithmic spiral disc perturbation @xmath6 to the double exponential formula describing the stellar volume emissivity and dust density ( see eqn .",
    "[ double_exp ] ) .",
    "we adopted the expression for @xmath6 in their formula 10 ( two spiral arms ) : @xmath7\\ ] ] with @xmath8 the fraction of stellar light or dust within the spiral arms , @xmath9 the pitch angle determining how tightly the spirals turn around each other and the exponent @xmath10 which regulates the relative size of the arm and interarm regions .",
    "for these parameters , we adopted the values @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then , we performed an rt calculation for a galaxy model ( including both old and young stellar discs ) in the b - band with face - on central optical depth @xmath14 and disc parameter values as in table [ table_p11_parameters ] .",
    "fig.[spiral_model_comparison ] shows the comparison for the output surface brightness images at different inclinations between a pure double exponential model ( upper row ) and for the model including spirals ( lower low ) .",
    "the images show the different morphology of the stellar emission for the face - on and low - inclination images",
    ". however , the edge - on images are remarkably similar for the two models .",
    "we also made a comparison for the total attenuation as a function of galaxy inclination for the two models , which is shown in fig.[plot_att_model ] .",
    "the attenuation curves are quite close to each other , within 0.02 dex , showing that the spiral pattern does not affect much the total attenuation of the galaxy for the adopted parameters .    finally , we compared the rfed profiles in the galaxy plane .",
    "fig.[plot_urad_prof_model ] shows the profiles for the pure double exponential model ( squares ) , a cut along the x - axis of the model including spiral arms ( blue line ) and its azimuthally averaged rfed profile .",
    "interestingly enough , although the rfed along the x - axis shows the variation due to the spiral arms , the azimuthally averaged profile is very close to the profile for the model without spiral arms .    although p11 have already shown that the spatially integrated dust and pah emission sed of a typical spiral galaxy does not depend on whether the young stellar population and associated dust is distributed in a circular spiral arm or in a disc , here",
    "we show for the first time that it is at the level of the radiation fields that heat the dust that the distributions in the spirals start to resemble the disc distributions on the average .    the results on the global attenuation",
    ", images and radiation fields , all suggest that double exponential models can be a quite good representation for spiral disc galaxies , and that the spatially integrated seds of spirals can be accounted by 2d models .",
    "although this is in qualitative agreement with previous works ( misiriotis et al .",
    "2000 , semionov et al . 2006 ,",
    "popescu et al . 2011 ) , a more extensive study is needed to see how the different parameters , e.g. the face - on optical depth , affect the attenuation curve and the radiation fields in models with and without spiral arms .    , @xmath15 and @xmath16 from left to right ) for a pure double exponential disc galaxy model ( upper row ) and a model including spiral arms ( lower row ) .",
    "the models are for a central face - on optical depth @xmath14 .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "in this paper we present a new ray - tracing dust radiation transfer algorithm which is able to handle arbitrary 3d geometries and it is specifically designed to calculate accurate rfed within galaxy models .",
    "the main optimization characteristics of this algorithm are the following : + 1 ) an adaptive 3d grid ( see  3.1 ) + 2 ) a ray - tracing algorithm based on the pre - calculation of a lower limit for the rfed ( see  3.2 and  3.3 ) + 3 ) an iterative procedure for the optimization of the angular density for the rays departing from each emitting cell (  3.3 ) . + furthermore , parallelized versions of the code have been written for its use on shared - memory machines and computer clusters .",
    "+ in order to verify the code accuracy , we performed comparisons with the results provided by other codes . specifically , we used our code to calculate solutions for a spherical dusty shell illuminated by a central point source and for an axis symmetric galaxy model .",
    "for the first configuration , we considered as benchmark a set of solutions calculated by using the dusty 1d code ( ivezic & elitzur 1997 ) .",
    "we showed that the equilibrium dust temperature radial profiles and the outgoing flux spectra derived by our 3d calculations agree within a few percent with the benchmark solutions for models with low radial optical depths ( @xmath17 ) but present larger discrepancies for more optically thick models ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the residual discrepancies , especially for the models with higher optical depths , are most probably due to the lack of dust self - heating in our code and the lower spatial resolution of the 3d calculations compared to the 1d ones . since the geometry of the source emission / opacity of star / dust shell does not reproduce that for which our algorithm was developed , namely that of an extended distribution of stellar emission and dust , we also used a second benchmark .",
    "thus , we considered the 2d calculations by popescu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for the rfed distribution within their galaxy model .",
    "we calculated the contribution to the rfed distribution due to an old stellar disc and a young stellar disc separately and we compared the results for radial and vertical rfed profiles derived for a set of reference radii and vertical distances .",
    "we found a general good agreement between the 3d and 2d calculations within a few percent in most of the cases .",
    "at least part of the residual discrepancy can be accounted by the relatively low spatial resolution of the grid used in the 3d calculation , which is not sufficient to properly resolve the thin disc component of the galaxy model of popescu et al .",
    "we showed an example of a 3d application of the code by performing rt for a spiral galaxy model where in one case the emissivity of the young stellar population and associated dust opacity are distributed in logarithmic spiral arms and in another case are distributed in exponential discs .",
    "we found that the edge - on images , the attenuation as a function of inclination and the azimuthally average rfed profiles on the galaxy plane are approximately the same for the two models .",
    "this suggests that the spatially integrated seds of spirals can be well described by 2d models .",
    "the tests we performed have shown that , in the conditions where dust self - heating is negligible and the 3d spatial resolution is high enough to resolve emission and opacity distributions , our code can be used to calculate accurate solutions for the rfed .",
    "this characteristic is particularly important for the calculation of stochastically heated dust emission , which requires both the overall intensity and the colour of the radiation field to be calculated in an accurate way . in a future work",
    "we will show applications of the code for the calculation of infrared emission .",
    "this will be performed using our 3d rt code coupled with the dust emission code used by popescu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which self - consistently calculates the stochastic emission from small grains and pah molecules . in this way",
    ", it will be possible to use our code to obtain both integrated seds and images in the mid- and fir - infrared for galaxies with arbitrary geometries .",
    "in addition , an important step will be to further optimize the code in order to make it possible to run on grids containing millions of cells in a reasonably short time .",
    "this will allow us to improve further the accuracy of the calculation for rfed within multi - scale structures spanning at least three orders of magnitude , such as from @xmath19pc to @xmath2010kpc in the case of a galaxy ism .",

    "<S> we present dart - ray , a new ray - tracing 3d dust radiative transfer ( rt ) code designed specifically to calculate radiation field energy density ( rfed ) distributions within dusty galaxy models with arbitrary geometries . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the basic algorithm implemented in dart - ray which is based on a pre - calculation of a lower limit for the rfed distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this pre - calculation allows us to estimate the extent of regions around the radiation sources within which these sources contribute significantly to the rfed . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , ray - tracing calculations can be restricted to take place only within these regions , thus substantially reducing the computational time compared to a complete ray - tracing rt calculation . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic scattering is included in the code and handled in a similar fashion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the code utilizes a cartesian adaptive spatial grid and an iterative method has been implemented to optimize the angular densities of the rays originated from each emitting cell . in order to verify the accuracy of the rt calculations performed by dart - ray , we present results of comparisons with solutions obtained using the dusty 1d rt code for a dust shell illuminated by a central point source and existing 2d rt calculations of disc galaxies with diffusely distributed stellar emission and dust opacity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the application of the code on a spiral galaxy model with logarithmic spiral arms in order to measure the effect of the spiral pattern on the attenuation and rfed .    </S>",
