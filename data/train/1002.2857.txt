    "it challenging to observe new ( bsm ) physics in inclusive processes at the lhc , where the signal could be buried under the overwhelming backgrounds . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the possibility to enhance the signal / background ratio using tagged outgoing forward protons .",
    "actually , by selecting events where the momentum fraction of the outgoing proton is very close to 1 , we turn the lhc into a pomeron - pomeron ( or @xmath6 ) collider , see , for instance@xcite . of course ,",
    "the energy and the luminosity are lower , but this may be compensated by the advantages which we discuss in section 2 .",
    "we consider some feasible applications in sections 3 - 6 . in section 3",
    "we discuss ` invisible ' higgs detection .",
    "another application is the possibility of using the semi - inclusive process @xmath7 to observe the production of pseudoscalar bosons , @xmath8 , where the @xmath9 signs denote the presence of large rapidity gaps . recall that in the pure exclusive process @xmath10 , pseudoscalar production is strongly suppressed by a `` @xmath11 p - even '' selection rule @xcite .",
    "however , in section 4 , we show that this is not the case for the semi - inclusive process , see also @xcite . in this section",
    "we consider the cross sections for both pseudoscalar @xmath8 and scalar @xmath12 semi - inclusive production .",
    "we apply these results , first , in section 5 , to the semi - inclusive production of the neutral bosons which occur in the higgs sector of supersymmetric models , where , for example , we consider the production of the pseudoscalar @xmath13 and the scalars @xmath14 of the mssm ; and then , second , in section 6 , we study the possible signals for the relatively light pseudo - goldstone bosons which may result from the spontaneous breaking of some new symmetry at very high scales , which are a typical feature of many bsm scenarios , see , for example , @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "the experimental signatures of many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios are characterised by events with sizeable missing energy and momentum , see , for example , @xcite . for example , in susy we may produce a pair of massive supersymmetric particles ( gluinos or squarks ) at the lhc , each of which decay into known particles together with the lightest supersymmetric particle which is stable and escapes detection .",
    "another missing - energy bsm scenario is large extra dimensions ( led ) in which interactions at the lhc may produce ( kaluza - klein ) gravitons , @xmath15 , which disappear into bulk space @xcite .",
    "yet another example is the production of a higgs boson which decays into a 4th generation heavy neutrino pair , for instance , @xcite  -  @xcite or a heavy photon pair @xcite , or other neutral particles which are not observable in the detectors , see , for example @xcite .",
    "there are other examples of a very specific experimental signature for the higgs boson decay , such as diphoton plus missing energy , considered in @xcite .",
    "of course , unexpected scenarios could well give events with missing energy and momentum .    the inclusive signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1](a ) ) of such bsm missing - transverse - energy events have sizeable sm backgrounds , particularly at lower values of @xmath16 coming , for example , from @xmath17 or @xmath18 production where the charm , @xmath19 , quark decays semi - leptonically . the neutrinos escape undetected . here",
    "we discuss a much cleaner missing - energy signal at the lhc , provided the new objects are not too heavy , see also @xcite .",
    "we consider the production of a massive system in some central rapidity interval , with large rapidity gaps on either side , with the forward outgoing protons measured at some distance far from the interaction point .",
    "actually , in this case , we can measure the missing 4-momentum , @xmath20 .",
    "the process is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1](b ) . thus , fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] shows the presence of bsm particles via decays either with missing transverse energy , @xmath16 , or with missing 4-momentum , @xmath20 .",
    "[ t ]     or missing 4-momentum , @xmath20 .",
    "the figure shows decays of the bsm object where some of the decay products are visible in the central detector .",
    "the method applies equally to totally invisible decays , as discussed in our illustrative example.,height=226 ]    at first sight it might appear strange to convert the lhc into a lower energy , lower luminosity ` pomeron - pomeron ' collider ( or @xmath6 collider ) .",
    "however there are advantages :    * we have almost @xmath21 geometry of detection of the centrally produced system ) is strongly suppressed by the large momentum fraction @xmath22 of the forward protons .",
    "the energy available for particles in the centrally produced system ( @xmath23 ) would be too small . ] .",
    "of course , the central detector acceptance in pseudorapidity ( @xmath24 for tracking and @xmath25 for calorimetry information ) limits , in turn , the mass of the centrally produced system that can be _ completely _ seen in the central detector .",
    "the hermiticity of the detector means we should be able , in principle , to accurately measure the missing 4-momentum , @xmath20 , and not just @xmath16 . in this way",
    ", we may see a peak in the missing - mass distribution .",
    "therefore , only at the lower ( pile - up free ) luminosities may we see a distinct peak in the missing - mass distribution . in summary ,",
    "the missing 4-momentum is determined from @xmath26 , where the last term allows for the possibility of accompanying particles @xmath27 in the central detector .",
    "this semi - inclusive process enhances the event rate by up to two orders of magnitude , as compared to exclusive production , but simultaneously degrades the missing - mass resolution , particularly in the presence of pile - up at high lhc luminosity . ] , indicating the presence of a new bsm object .",
    "note , however , the peak in a semi - inclusive process will not be so narrow as in the pure exclusive case .",
    "* there is a lower sm background . in inclusive missing @xmath28 events the background originates mainly from @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "their rate is suppressed for the semi - inclusive as compared to the inclusive case , since , unlike @xmath31 collisions , in pomeron - pomeron interactions there are no valence - quark initiated subprocesses .",
    "* moreover , by selecting semi - inclusive events with large rapidity gaps via the tagged forward protons , we eliminate the underlying - event background caused by the multiple interactions of the incoming protons .",
    "* there is the possibility to scan the energy of the centrally produced system , @xmath32 , and to measure the position of the threshold for the production , and hence the mass , of the new object . * in comparison with central exclusive production ( cep ) , see @xcite . ]",
    "the cross section is much larger due to the almost total absence of the sudakov factor , @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , only the small part of @xmath34 , due to emission in the beam pipe direction ( which may escape detection in the calorimeter ) , should be kept .",
    "moreover there is very little depletion of the signal due to enhanced soft rescattering ( which could have populated the rapidity gaps ) ; the survival factor @xmath35 for @xmath36 @xcite . * besides having an effective ` pomeron - pomeron ' collider , there is also the possibility to study @xmath6 central production , see , for instance , @xcite,@xcite@xmath37@xcite .",
    "if we are able to select events with outgoing protons with transverse momenta @xmath38 100 mev or @xmath39 300 mev , we may distinguish between @xmath6 and ` pomeron - pomeron ' collisions , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "if the new object is heavy ( @xmath40 gev ) , the sm background is not a danger and it is better to search for such an object in the conventional inclusive process , where the whole initial @xmath31-collision energy can be used .",
    "however , for objects with mass @xmath41 gev , the lower background , together with the possibility to scan the energy , means that the semi - inclusive process offers a better opportunity for detection .",
    "moreover , by observing the forward outgoing protons and measuring the whole missing 4-momentum , @xmath20 , we can study events with @xmath42 missing @xmath28 , but large missing @xmath43 , and have the possibility of observing peaks in the missing mass distribution . the proposed approach will provide a valuable addition to the existing wide programme of bsm studies in cep processes at the lhc in the forward proton mode , see @xcite,@xcite@xmath37@xcite .",
    "at present , various bsm scenarios are under consideration . note , that the current limits on the mass of the susy particles ( the gluinos and squarks ) are sufficiently large to justify using the inclusive signal . for a specific example of a bsm scenario where the semi - inclusive signal is favoured",
    ", we consider the production of the so - called invisible higgs boson , see @xcite .",

    "@xcite , but with a better account of the kinematics of the central detector .",

    "recall that the @xmath28 of such a boson will be rather low @xmath48 , so conventional detection based on large @xmath16 is practically impossible .",
    "the sm backgrounds for semi - inclusive central production are suppressed and can be controlled . the main background is the production of @xmath49 and @xmath50 pairs with subsequent semi - leptonic decays selection rule . ] .",
    "this background is larger than the expected signal by about a factor of 300 , but note that only the part of this background under the higgs missing mass peak is relevant .",
    "moreover , it can be rejected by observing the accompanying charged leptons , and also by observing the vertices of @xmath51 , and possibly @xmath52 , meson decay .",
    "recall that if we change the pomeron - pomeron energy , @xmath32 , we should be able to observe the threshold behaviour of the signal , which would confirm the presence of the invisible object indicated by the peak in the missing - mass distribution obtained from @xmath20 .",
    "the possibility of detecting an invisible higgs has been taken just an illustrative example of the use of the semi - inclusive signal .",
    "the points made above apply quite generally to semi - inclusive signatures .",
    "in many bsm scenarios it is natural to have a relatively light pseudoscalar boson @xmath8 , which may result from the spontaneous breaking of some extra symmetry at high scale . as a rule such a pseudo - goldstone boson",
    "is dominantly coupled to very heavy fermions ( of this extra symmetry ) , and therefore the production cross section is expected to be quite small in @xmath31 collisions ( that is , in light quark collisions ) . the best possibility to create",
    "@xmath8 is via gluon - gluon fusion mediated by the anomaly in the heavy fermion loop .",
    "this is analogous to higgs boson production via the top - quark triangle .",
    "the process @xmath53 may be described by the effective point - like lagrangian @xcite  =  _ -tr(g_^g^ _ ) .",

    "the gluons of the @xmath55 subprocess are indicated by their 4-momenta @xmath56 .",
    ", height=226 ]    we shall see that semi - inclusive processes provide an attractive possibility to search for new pseudoscalars , @xmath8 .",
    "the reasons are ( a ) that we deal with initial gluon - gluon collisions , and ( b ) we have much lower qcd and multiple interaction backgrounds . at first sight",
    ", we would expect a strong suppression of pseudoscalar @xmath8 production .",
    "the subprocess may be written as @xmath57 , where the superscript @xmath58 indicates that the initial active gluons each come from a colour - singlet perturbative pomeron ; hence their polarisations are correlated in such a way that the incoming state has @xmath59 and even p @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the purely exclusive process , @xmath60 , this `` @xmath11 p - even '' selection rule effectively filters out the @xmath8 boson , leaving just the @xmath12 signal .",
    "however , in the semi - inclusive process , @xmath54 , the pseudoscalar @xmath8 is much less suppressed @xcite .",
    "the process is sketched in fig.[fig : a3 ] .",
    "the subprocess @xmath55 is the lowest-@xmath61-order of semi - inclusive @xmath62 production .",
    "we are unable to emit just one gluon since the initial @xmath63 state is colourless .",
    "the cross sections for scalar and pseudoscalar boson production , via the subprocess @xmath55 , are derived in the appendix .",
    "the result is d ( gg g_c g_d )  =  n  |m()|^2 [ eq : sighat ] where ( _ )  =  1 .",
    "[ eq : ha2 ] and @xmath64 is the square of the c.m .",
    "subprocess energy .",
    "the normalisation factor @xmath65 is given in the appendix .",
    "as a rule , soft gluon emission does not change the polarisation structure of the amplitude , and a pseudoscalar particle should not be created in the collision of two gluons in a p - even state .",
    "so why is pseudoscalar @xmath8 production in @xmath66 possible ? to gain insight into why occurs , it is informative to look at the structure of the two triple - gluon vertices in fig.[fig : a3 ] .",
    "recall that a triple - gluon vertex which is responsible for gluon emission contains three terms , as shown in fig.[fig : a4 ] .",
    "[ h ]    , of fig.[fig : a3 ] where @xmath67 denote the gluon polarisations .",
    "there is a similar structure for the lower triple - gluon vertex .",
    ", height=226 ]    here , diagram ( a ) preserves the helicity , @xmath68 , whereas the sum of the last two diagrams flips the helicity the incoming polarisation vector @xmath69 goes to gluon @xmath19 , while gluon @xmath70 gets a polarisation @xmath71 in the direction of @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 is orthogonal to @xmath72 , this means that @xmath69 is orthogonal to @xmath71 .",
    "similarly for diagram ( c ) . from the sum ( b)@xmath9(c )",
    "we find @xmath74 .",
    "] , @xmath74 . however , the contribution of ( a ) is enhanced relative to ( b)+(c ) by the factor .",
    "the @xmath75 enhancement can be checked easily using the explicit form of the triple - gluon vertex displayed in fig.[fig : a4 ] , and the fact that the polarisation vectors of the gluons are orthogonal to their momenta . ]",
    "@xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the light - cone fraction of the momentum @xmath78 of the incoming gluon carried by gluon @xmath19 . recall that , according to the @xmath59 , p - even selection rule , the incoming gluons @xmath79 and @xmath80 have the same helicity , @xmath81 .",
    "this configuration corresponds to the production of the scalar boson @xmath12 , whereas we need @xmath82 in order to saturate the levi - civita tensor to produce a pseudoscalar @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the production of a scalar @xmath12 is driven by diagram ( a ) of the triple - gluon vertex , whereas production of a pseudoscalar @xmath8 comes from diagrams ( b)+(c ) in one of the two three - gluon vertices . since ( b)+(c )",
    "is suppressed by the factor @xmath77 ( or @xmath83 if it is the lower gluon vertex which provides the pseudoscalar character ) the amplitude @xmath84 vanishes as @xmath85 , see ( [ eq : ha2 ] ) or the derivation in the appendix .",
    "as an example , we consider scalar and pseudoscalar neutral higgs boson production in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , which contains three neutral higgs bosons : the light @xmath86 and heavy @xmath87 scalars , and the pseudoscalar @xmath13 , @xcite . in a large area of tan@xmath88 parameter space ,",
    "the pseudoscalar boson @xmath13 is practically degenerate with one of the scalar bosons , not only in mass and width , but also in the branching ratios of the main decay channels .",
    "therefore , it will be challenging to separate @xmath13 from @xmath87 ( or @xmath86 ) , and to know what we have observed .",
    "for the purely exclusive process , @xmath60 , the `` @xmath59 , p - even '' selection rule effectively filters out the @xmath13 boson production , leaving just the @xmath86 and @xmath87 signal .",
    "however , in the semi - inclusive process , @xmath54 , the pseudoscalar is much less suppressed , see @xcite . in comparison with exclusive scalar higgs production , @xmath89 ,",
    "cross section of the semi - inclusive subprocess , @xmath90 , contains the qcd coupling factor @xmath91 , but it is enhanced by the logarithmically large phase space , available for the final gluons and by a larger semi - inclusive luminosity . the latter occurs because the suppression caused by the sudakov - like @xmath92 factor is much weaker , since we can permit radiation of additional softer gluons , @xmath93 .",
    "the extra soft emission does not essentially change either the kinematics or the polarisation structure of the process .",
    "thus , for scalar @xmath87 production we expect a cross section larger than that for pure cep process .",
    "in addition , recall that for the allowed values of tan@xmath94 , the coupling of higgs - like bosons to gluons is larger than that in the sm .",
    "now what region of phase space will maximise the cross section , ( [ eq : sighat ] ) , for semi - inclusive pseudoscalar @xmath13 production ?",
    "we take the kinematics where one gluon , say gluon @xmath19 , is soft , and contains both the collinear @xmath95 and the soft @xmath96 logarithms . in particular , in the interval @xmath97 gev we will have ln@xmath98 , and ln@xmath99 .",
    "this is enough to compensate the small @xmath100 factor . for the second gluon , gluon @xmath101",
    ", we may take a similar choice for the collinear log , but we need a relatively large @xmath102 to make @xmath64 sufficiently large to avoid too much suppression from the factor @xmath103 of ( [ eq : ha2 ] ) .",
    "this means that in the case of @xmath13 production we should observe an energetic jet carrying about a half of pomeron - pomeron collision energy .",
    "consider a relatively light pseudoscalar @xmath13 of mass 115 gev , which would be almost degenerate with the light scalar @xmath86 .",
    "if we take the default parameters of feynhiggs @xcite including @xmath104=200gev , and tan@xmath10530 , then we find @xmath106=0.9 mev . with standard cms / atlas kinematics at the lhc ,",
    "the integrated semi - inclusive luminosity is  y  =  10 ^ -2 .",
    "that is , we will have one @xmath63 pair of active gluons for every 100 @xmath31 collisions at 14 tev .",
    "the effective ( observable ) cross section of semi - inclusive @xmath13 production , @xmath107 , is about d_obs  =  12fb  |m(a)|^2 , where @xmath108 is given in ( [ eq : ha2 ] ) .",
    "here we have not integrated over the phase space of the hardest gluon ( @xmath101 ) emission , but have included the integration over the softer emitted gluon ( @xmath19 ) in the 12fb .",
    "the kinematical factor @xmath109 in ( [ eq : xc ] ) is essentially cancelled by the approximate @xmath110 dependence of @xmath111 in this kinematic domain .",
    "if we integrate over the relevant phase space of the hard gluon , then we obtain @xmath112 4fb .",
    "unfortunately for semi - inclusive @xmath113 production and decay , the qcd @xmath49 background is not suppressed by the @xmath59 selection rule ( unlike pure exclusive production ) .",
    "therefore we resort to the @xmath114 decay mode , which has a branching fraction of about 10@xmath115 . the final semi - inclusive cross section , _",
    "obs(a ) ~0.4fb , is small , but not hopeless for a large lhc luminosity@xcite .",
    "moreover , there are ideas that at the next stage(s ) of the cms upgrade , it may be possible to double the trigger latency of the experiment , which would allow for the design of a level-1 trigger for the proton spectrometers at 420 m @xcite . ] .",
    "the main background is the semi - inclusive process @xmath116 + 2 quark jets , arising from the double - pomeron - exchange ( dpe ) , with two quarks in the hard matrix element @xmath117 coming from the pdfs of the soft pomeron .",
    "using the known diffractive pdfs , we find that the corresponding cross section ( @xmath118fb ) is comparable to that of the @xmath119 signal .",
    "this background contribution can be calibrated using the @xmath120 and @xmath121 modes .",
    "note that in the standard atlas inclusive searches @xcite , for mssm higgs bosons in the mass range @xmath122 gev , the dominant background is also @xmath123 .",
    "although the measured @xmath124 mass distribution is broad , a mass window @xmath125 gev can be imposed in order to reduce the background by about a factor of 5 @xcite . a similar procedure could be applied in our semi - inclusive case , with the @xmath126 signal extracted in a similar way to the inclusive search .",
    "with such a favourable expected signal - to - background ratio , @xmath127 , it will be important to determine the experimental strategy , such as triggering , event selection and cuts , which , in particular , will allow a strong reduction of the overlap background caused by pile - up events .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , unlike inclusive mssm higgs searches in the @xmath126 mode , in our case the @xmath128 background is very small , and can be neglected .    for a heavier pseudoscalar @xmath13 boson of mass 140 gev , where now @xmath13 and @xmath87 are approximately degenerate , @xmath129 is about twice smaller , using the same susy parameters .",
    "however , in some exotic susy scenarios ( such as @xmath130700 gev , for example , @xcite ) the semi - inclusive @xmath13 production cross section can be 10 times larger .",
    "the presence of the pseudoscalar @xmath13 boson signal may be revealed by the threshold behaviour .",
    "if we neglect boson width effects , then we expect just after threshold for scalar @xmath87 production that the cross section will decrease due to the factor @xmath131 of ( [ eq : ha2 ] ) , while the existence of a pseudoscalar @xmath13 will make the decrease much slower . indeed ,",
    "in the case of degenerate @xmath13 and @xmath87 bosons , we have _ h  :  _ a  :  _ a+h  ( 1-)^2  :  ^2  :  1 - 2 + 2 ^ 2 , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 , with the threshold at @xmath134 .",
    "a light pseudoscalar goldstone boson , @xmath79 , with a mass in the range of a few gev , is not excluded by experiment , is usually required in order to avoid the constraints from lep on the light higgs decay @xmath135 .",
    "lower mass limits come from the searches for new light cp - odd particles in radiative @xmath136 decays ( see , for example , @xcite ) or from the searches for @xmath137 decay chains at the tevatron ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "note , that as discussed in @xcite , the coupling of the pseudoscalar @xmath79 to down - type quarks and charged leptons can be strongly suppressed . in such a case , the upper limit for the mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath79 could be as high as @xmath138/2 . ] , because it couples very weakly to light flavour fermions , see , for example @xcite  -  @xcite . in some extensions of the mssm",
    "the dominant decay of the lightest higgs boson is @xmath139 , with @xmath140 @xcite or to @xmath50 @xcite , or to @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "this , in particular , will allow a reduction in tension between the lep limit on the higgs mass and fine tuning , which is needed in order for the lep higgs mass limit to be compatible with mssm . a light pseudo - goldstone boson , that couples significantly to the higgs boson , is required also in many other theories , such as little higgs models and non - supersymmetric two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "light pseudoscalars @xmath79 are also suggested by superstring modelling .",
    "for example , the global symmetry breaking scenario , discussed in @xcite , implies the existence of a few - gev pseudo - goldstone boson @xmath79 , with a dominant decay into two gluon jets , @xmath142 .",
    "now the @xmath79 bosons that are produced in @xmath87 decay , may have relatively large transverse momenta , @xmath143 gev .",
    "thus , the opening angle between the two gluon jets in an @xmath142 decay , @xmath144 , is smaller than the size of the jet cone usually used in the jet searching algorithm . in this case",
    ", the system , @xmath145 , will be seen experimentally as two broad jets , each composed of a gluon pair .",
    "the unusual feature of these gluon pairs is that each pair forms a colour singlet .",
    "actually a gluon pair is a short , light @xmath146 _ colour string _ , boosted in the transverse direction .",
    "the multiplicity of this system is much lower than for the usual gluon jet with the same @xmath147 .",
    "after the lorentz boost , we have almost no low @xmath147 particles .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to search for events with such special characteristics in semi - inclusive processes , where the background of low @xmath147 hadrons , arising from multiple interactions , is absent .",
    "moreover , the @xmath142 jet may be revealed as a narrow peak , @xmath148 in the distribution over the jet mass , measured in a way similar to that proposed in ref .",
    "here , we have discussed the advantages of semi - inclusive processes with two fast tagged forward outgoing protons , in the search for new bsm phenomena . the limited energy transfer to the central system",
    "allows the observation of all the secondaries in the central detector , which , in this case , therefore , covers practically the whole @xmath21 domain . despite the low cross sections , this offers an attractive tool to observe ( a ) events with missing longitudinal 4-momentum ( as in invisible higgs production ) , and ( b ) new bsm effects ( in particular , the production of possible pseudoscalar goldstone bosons @xmath62 ) in pomeron - pomeron collisions selected by semi - inclusive kinematics , @xmath149 .",
    "the @xmath9 signs denote large rapidity gaps , and @xmath150 indicates any number of soft particles ( in the central detector ) .",
    "an advantage over inclusive production is that there is a much lower background from underlying events .",
    "since such bsm particle searches may be done using the planned forward proton detectors at the lhc , we believe this opportunity to look for new neutral heavy objects should be given a serious consideration .",
    "the tree - level amplitudes of the subprocess @xmath151 may be evaluated in the helicity formalism @xcite .",
    "they take the form m ( )  =  cg^2_perm  tr(t^at^bt^ct^d )  m(,k_a^_a , k_b^_b , k_c^_c , k_d^_d ) , where the constant @xmath152 is the coupling of the effective @xmath153 vertex ( see ( [ eq : ggv ] ) ) ; @xmath154 are colour matrices of the fundamental representation of su(3 ) ; @xmath155 is the qcd coupling ; and @xmath156 and @xmath78 are the helicities and momenta of the corresponding gluons . if we use the ward identity m(,a , b , c , d )  +  m(,b , a , c , d )  +  m(,b , c , a , d )  =  0 , and the fact that the two incoming gluons , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , form a colour singlet , then the final result may be expressed in terms of just one of these three amplitude forms  @xmath157 .",

    "as we are looking for a logarithmically ( @xmath160 ) enhanced cross section , and we are assuming that at least one of secondary gluons is soft , we have neglected a second contribution to ( [ eq : b2 ] ) , which is suppressed by the factor @xmath161 . also we neglect the possibly complex phases of the amplitudes @xmath162 , since they are the same for both amplitudes .",
