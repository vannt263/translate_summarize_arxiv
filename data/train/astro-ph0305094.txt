    "evidence shows that there is a strong connection between active galactic nuclei and their host galaxies . within the framework of the hierarchical dark - matter cosmology ,",
    "the formation and evolution of galaxies and their active nuclei is intimately related ( fabian 1999 ; haehnelt et al . 1998 ; mathur 2000 ) .",
    "magorrian ( 1998 ) found that the central massive black hole ( mbh ) mass is proportional to the mass of the host bulge in a sample of nearby galaxies , hereafter referred to as the mbh / bulge relation , with the mbh mass being about 0.006 of the bulge mass .",
    "laor ( 1998 ) also found this relation for 14 bright quasars .",
    "recent research using higher quality hst data and a more careful treatment of the modelling uncertainties give lower values of the central mbh masses in nearby galaxies , with an average mbh - to - bulge mass ratio of about 0.001 and a nearly linear mbh  bulge relation , @xmath9 ( merritt , ferrarese 2001 ; kormendy , gebhardt 2001 ; mclure , dunlop 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "however , laor ( 2001 ) suggested a nonlinear mbh / bulge mass relation , @xmath10 , and showed that the mean mbh - to - bulge mass ratio is therefore not a universal constant , which is related to the bulge masses . the bulge information of late - type spirals and of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) ( both predicted to have low @xmath11 ) can test the mbh / bulge nonlinear relation .",
    "wandel ( 2002 ) revised the mbh / bulge relation for a sample of 55 agns and 35 inactive galaxies .",
    "he found that broad - line agns ( bl agns ) have an average mbh / bulge mass ratio of @xmath12 0.0015 and strong correlations , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "for a few narrow - line agns ( nl agns ) in wandel ( 2002 ) , the average mbh / bulge mass ratio is really lower,@xmath15 .",
    "mathur ( 2000 ) has proposed that the nls1s are likely to be active galaxies in an early stage of evolution , and therefore have a lower mbh / bulge mass ratio than bl agns .",
    "mathur et al . (",
    "2001 ) have estimated the central mbh mass for 15 nls1s by fitting their spectral energy distributions with the accretion disk and corona model ( kuraskiewicz et al .",
    "2000 ) , and found the mean mass ratio of the mbh / bulge to be 0.00005 , lower by a factor of 30 compared to that for broad - line agns .",
    "it is found that the central mbh mass is not only related to the bulge luminosity , but also to the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "ferrarese and merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt et al.(2000a ) have found that the mbh mass of inactive galaxies is better correlated with the stellar velocity dispersion in the host bulge than with the bulge luminosity , and that the relations are respectively @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that the mbh masses of a few seyfert galaxies from reverberation mapping are consistent with the relation between the mbh mass and galaxy velocity dispersion which they have found in inactive galaxies .",
    "the theoretical interpretation for the mbh / bulge relation is discussed based on several models .",
    "one model is about merger - driven starbursts with black hole accretion ( kauffmann , haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "some models are based on black hole accretion influencing the star formation and gas dynamics in the host galaxies ( silk , rees 1998 ; blandford 1999 ) .",
    "adams et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented an idealized model of the collapse of the inner part of protogalaxies , and assumed the mbh mass is determined when the centrifugal radius of the collapse flow exceeds the capture radius of the central mbh .",
    "they produced the observed relation between the mbh mass and the galactic velocity dispersion , and predicted the mass ratio of the mbh / bulge : @xmath18 .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) presented a model which could explain the mbh / bulge relation in agns and the dependence on the environmental parameters of the host galaxies , such as the gas or stellar velocity dispersion , as well as the relation of the central star burst and accretion process during galactic interaction .",
    "they also discussed the mass ratio of mbh / bulge based on a unified formation scheme , where the bulge formation and nucleus activity are triggered by galaxy mergers or tidal interactions , and found a correlation of the mass ratio of the mbh / bulge to be roughly @xmath19 .",
    "it is important to investigate the lower limit of the mbh / bulge mass ratio because it will reveal physical links between the bulge and the mbh .",
    "there has been a progress concerning the estimation method of the central mbh mass in agns ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; ho 1999 ; kaspi 2000 ; wang , lu 2001 ) .",
    "nls1s are suggested to have smaller central mbh masses with higher accretion rates close to the eddington limit .",
    "therefore , nls1s could play a particular role to understand the formation of the bulge and central mbh in galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the mbh / bulge relation in nl agns compared with bl agns using the recent estimation of mbh masses of nl agns . in section 2",
    "we present a sample of the nl agns , along with the estimated mass of the central mbh and the bulge . in section 3",
    "we explore the mbh / bulge relation for the bl agns and nl agns .",
    "the result and a discussion are presented in section 4 , and in section 5 we summarize our conclusion .",
    "all of the cosmological calculations in this paper assume @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "in order to investigate mbh / bulge relation in nl agns , we used available data of the bulge luminosity ( mackenty 1990 ; whittle 1992 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ; malkan et al .",
    "1998 ) and central mbh mass ( veron - cetty et al . 2001 ; wang , lu 2001 ) for nl agns in the literature .",
    "we selectd nl agns with the bmh mass and the bulge luminosity .",
    "veron - cetty et al . ( 2001 ) have compiled 83 objects known to us before 1998 january either to be nls1s or to have a `` broad '' balmer component narrower than @xmath23 , north of @xmath24 , bright than @xmath25 and with @xmath26 .",
    "the measurement with a moderate resolution of 3.4@xmath27 for 59 nls1s of the instrument - subtracted [ o @xmath5 and h@xmath28 widths as well as the optical magnitude at @xmath29 band are listed in table 2 and table 3 in veron - cetty et al.(2001 ) , which are used to calculate mbh masses .",
    "we obtained the bulge absolute blue magnitude ( @xmath30 ) to calculate the mass of the bulge .",
    "the number of nls1 suitable for studying the nls1s mbh / bulge relation is limited because there is so little information about the nls1s bulge luminosity .",
    "we obtained a sample of 22 nl agns ( table 1 ) .",
    "wandel ( 2002 ) derived the mbh / bulge relation for 46 bl agns , 9 nl agns , and 35 quiescent galaxies .",
    "our sample includes all 9 nl agns in the wandel ( 2002 ) sample .",
    "the central mbh masses of only 6 nl agns ( mrk 335 , ngc 4051 , 3c 120 , mark 110 , mrk 590 , pg 1704 ) in our sample were estimated from the reverberation mapping method .",
    "for the other 16 nl agns , we estimated the size of the broad line region ( blr ) using an empirical correlation between the size and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100 @xmath31 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 was estimated from the @xmath29-magnitude by adopting an average optical spectral index of -0.5 and accounting for the galactic redding and @xmath34-correction .",
    "if the h@xmath28 widths reflect the keplerian velocity of the line - emitting blr material around the central mbh , then the so - called virial mass estimated for the central mbh is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath37 is the velocity of the line - emitting material .",
    "@xmath37 can be estimated from the h@xmath28 width .",
    "assuming random orbits , kaspi ( 2000 ) related the @xmath37 to the fwhm of the h@xmath28 emission line by @xmath38}$ ] .",
    "the calculated central mbh masses for 15 nls1s are listed in table 1 ( wang , lu 2001 ) .",
    "we estimate the bulge masses of the nls1s from the bulge absolute blue magnitude ( @xmath30 ) of the host galaxies ( laor 1998 ; wandel 1999 ; mathur 2000 ) .",
    "@xmath30 was calculated from the galaxy s total bulge blue magnitude ( @xmath39 ) by the simien and de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) equation , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the hubble - type of the galaxy .",
    "we adopted a canonical hubble - type of sa for mrk 734 , mrk 486 , and mrk 1239 .",
    "for mrk 1044 , we took the host galaxy magnitude from mackenty ( 1990 ) , who included nuclear emission in the total blue magnitude .",
    "hence , in table 1 we quote the blue magnitude as an upper limit .",
    "we then use the relation between the bulge @xmath29 and @xmath37 magnitudes .",
    "we used @xmath43 , and calculated the bulge luminosity from the empirical formula , @xmath44 finally , we used the mass and luminosity relation for normal galaxies from magorrian et al .",

    "although we obtained the mbh / bulge mass ratios for 22 nl agns , we should noticed that there are some uncertainties in the estimation of the mbh / bulge mass ratios .",
    "there are mainly several opinions concerning the origin about the narrow width of h@xmath28 in nls1s .",
    "one is the small inclinations in nls1s ( figure 1 in mclure , dunlop 2002 ; bian , zhao 2002 ) ; the second is the long distance of the blrs emitting line of h@xmath28 in nls1s ; the third is their higher value of @xmath51 because of their low central black hole masses .",
    "the second option is more plausible considering the other properties in nls1s ( turner et al .",
    "2002 ) . the uncertainties in the @xmath29 magnitude , continua , and the empirical equation 1 would lead to an uncertainty of about 0.5 index in the mbh mass estimation ( wang , lu 2001 ) .    the errors in the calculated bulge masses are mainly related to the calculation of the bulge magnitude and the mass - light relation for the bulge",
    "the bulge luminosity obtained by a bulge / disk decomposition of the galaxy images tends to be systematically lower than that from the empirical formula for the bulge / total ratio , depending on the hubble type ( simien , de vauculours 1986 ; wandel 2002 ) .",
    "wandel ( 2002 ) found a bulge luminosity correction based on the width line of @xmath52 , which is derived from 15 seyfert 1 galaxies common to the wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) sample and the mclure and dunlop ( 2001 ) sample .",
    "we do nt use this bulge luminosity correction because we find it larger than the value of the bulge luminosity for the nl agns .",
    "accurate values of the bulge luminosity for nl agns is necessary in a study of the mbh / bulge relation in nl agns . in the mass  light relation , @xmath53 , @xmath28 is usually adopted as 1.18 since it is was determined through stellar dynamics ( magorrian 1998 ) .",
    "however , mclure and dunlop ( 2001 ) assumed the relation @xmath54 , which is from the gunn - r fundamental plane study ( jorgensen 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath55 .    in figure 2",

    "we notice that the relation is mainly due to the smaller mbh / bulge mass ratio and the smaller velocity dispersion for the nl agns .",
    "this relation can be expected from the relation between the mbh mass and the bulge mass and the relation between mbh mass and stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "our result gives @xmath57 and @xmath58 . if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 [ @xmath61 , ferrarese et al .",

    "the mean mbh / bulge mass ratio of nls1s will be significantly smaller than that of bl agns and normal galaxies .",
    "a scenario of mbh growth is his preferred interpretation .",
    "the accretion process determines the mbh mass ( haehnelt et al .",
    "the salpeter time for the growth of mbh , i.e. the @xmath63-folding time , is @xmath64 yr , where @xmath65 is the radiative efficiency normalized to 0.1 .",
    "let us assume the calculated mbh masses to be the initial mbh masses .",
    "the mbh would grow to a `` final '' seyfert mass , which is estimated from the mbh / bulge mass ratio in bl agns and the bulge masses .",

    "the growth time for nls1s to a `` final '' seyfert galaxy is @xmath67 yr .",

    "another interpretation of the nonlinear mbh / bulge relation is that it is also possible that that nl agns occur in low-@xmath70 galaxies , and that in such galaxies @xmath0 is lower than in galaxies with a higher @xmath70 if we consider that nl agns already have their `` final '' @xmath71 .",
