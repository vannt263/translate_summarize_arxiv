    "the temperature @xmath1 is fixed to be @xmath164 . from the fig .",
    "[ fig : abfpuva ] , it is apparent that the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and md results tends to increase as @xmath152 increases .",

    "( [ eq : g_exact ] ) , the solid line is the prediction of the lower bound according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : low ] ) . ]",
    "one possible reason is that the gibbs free energy given by the lower bound depart from the exact result significantly at large @xmath152 ( we can see that from the inset in fig . [",
    "fig : abfpuva ] ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the first cumulant approximation we adopted in deriving the inequalities is not enough .",
    "higher order contributions to the gibbs free energy must be considered in order to improve this method @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented a variational approach to study renormalized phonons in momentum conserving nonlinear lattices .",
    "specifically , we obtain two optimal harmonic reference systems , namely , the lh system and the uh system , by optimizing the two bounds of the gibbs free energy of the nonlinear system .",
    "these optimal systems which determine the properties of renormalized phonons can be regarded as optimal harmonic approximations of the nonlinear system .",
    "this method has been applied to lattices with either symmetric or asymmetric potentials , with or without pressure . for lattices with symmetric potentials , such as the fpu-@xmath58 lattice ,",
    "our variational approach gives two optimal and symmetrical reference harmonic lattices .",
    "in the zero pressure case , it is very interesting to find that the sound velocity derived from the lh system reproduce the previous theoretical results from the effective phonon theory and nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic theory , and the sound velocity derived from the uh system recover the previous theoretical results from a self - consistent approach .    for lattices with asymmetric potentials , such as the fpu-@xmath59 lattice where the existing effective phonon theory fails to predict the sound velocity",
    ", our variational approach can also give accurate predictions .",
    "in particular , our approach reveals the reason why the effective phonon theory can not predict the correct sound velocity .    in all the cases , the lh system works better than the uh system ,",
    "since the ensemble averages in the former are evaluated under the probability measure of the nonlinear system , it simultaneously takes nonlinear contributions into account compared with the latter .",
    "therefore , the lh system can be treated as an effective theory of renormalized phonons in various momentum conserving nonlinear lattices . a deviation between the prediction of our variational approach and the md results has also been found for stronger asymmetry and nonzero pressure situation where the underlying mechanism needs further investigations .",
    "compared with the existing quasi - harmonic theories , this approach can be used to investigate nonlinear systems with asymmetric potentials .",
    "we owe this ability to two aspects .",
    "one is the choice of an parameterized asymmetric harmonic potential with a parameter @xmath63 which can quantifies the degree of asymmetry of the potentials .",
    "the other is the consideration of the gibbs free energy instead of the helmholtz free energy , which enables us to deal with systems with pressure .",
    "we also found that the nfh gives satisfactory predictions of sound velocity in all those cases .",
    "the theory focuses on a hydrodynamic description of nonlinear lattices , not a construction of an effective theory of the renormalized phonons in nonlinear lattices .",
    "those agreements means that the hydrodynamic approximation really captures essential features of the systems in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "however , for systems without momentum conservation , the concept of sound velocity is invalid , the nfh may not be able to give the information of the renormalized phonons , although it can still describe correlation functions of those systems @xcite . while our variational approach can be uesd to investigate phonon band gap and phonon dispersion of those systems @xcite .",
