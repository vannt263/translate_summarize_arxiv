    "our optimal ecp for atomic ensembles in a partially entangled pure state with known parameters has the optimal success probability as the same as that of the ecp for two - photon systems @xcite and it is achieved by the detection of a single photon which interacts with a single - sided cavity one time .",
    "it can be used to distill the entanglement of each pair of atomic ensembles and does not require additional atomic ensembles , which relaxes the difficulty of its implementation in experiment largely .",
    "our efficient ecp can be used to distill a subset of atomic ensembles in a maximally entangled state from those in a partially entangled pure state with unknown parameters , resorting to a pcd which is constructed in a simple way and involves only one effective input - output process of a single photon , not two or more .",
    "moreover , the success of our efficient ecp is heralded by the individual detection of one @xmath72 photon in each node , independent of the scaled coupling strength @xmath253 , which is far different from the existing cavity - involved ecps @xcite . by iteration of the concentration process , our efficient ecp has the maximal success probability , compared with other ecps for the quantum systems in an entangled pure state with unknown parameters .",
    "our epp for nonlocal atomic ensembles in a mixed entangled state is more efficient than that in @xcite , where the entanglement purification for atomic systems is completed with the epp for two - photon systems in @xcite conditioned on the effective quantum memory @xcite . in @xcite , a cnot gate for the two ensembles in each node",
    "is used to perform the epp and it doubles the efficiency , compared with that in @xcite , while the two ensembles are required to be placed so close to each other that the cnot gate can be performed faithfully .",
    "this requirement is not needed when the pcds are used to perform our epp and the efficiency of our epp equals to that in @xcite in the ideal case .    in actual implementations , errors can always take place .",
    "the efficiencies and the fidelities of our three edps are influenced by some experimental factors , such as the detector s efficiency , the decay of the radiation to non - cavity modes , the impurities of the single - photon sources , and so on . for heralded single - photon sources based on the probabilistic correlated photon generation with a pdc source ,",
    "we should make the average pair production levels much less than one to avoid producing multiple pairs that lead to the impurity in the heralded channel @xcite .",
    "besides , with the development of the deterministic single - photon source @xcite , the impact of the impurities of the single - photon sources can be further reduced .",
    "the photon loss due to the cavity mirror scattering and absorption and the nonunit efficiency of the detectors will decrease the efficiency of the input - output process and thus will reduce the efficiency ( success probability ) of our edps .",
    "fortunately , all our edps succeed conditioned on the detection of a single photon and the instances with photon loss can be picked out according to the response of the detectors .    in summary",
