    "in the long standing challenge of the calculation of hadron spectrum from the first - principles lattice qcd simulation , the inclusion of dynamical quarks , or unquenching , has been the crucial but computationally demanding step .",
    "thanks to the rapid increase of the computer power and recent developments in the lattice formulations and numerical algorithms , such simulations have become feasible in the past several years .",
    "one of the stumbling block toward full qcd simulations has been the treatment of the third dynamical quark , _",
    "i.e. _ , the strange quark . since the standard hmc algorithm  @xcite assumes that the number of flavor is even , previous simulations including the odd number of flavors had to use a non - exact algorithm , such as the @xmath0 algorithm  @xcite , which contains a systematic error of order @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the molecular dynamics step size .",
    "recently an exact hmc algorithm with polynomial approximation has been developed  @xcite and this difficulty has been essentially removed .",
    "a major problem in the dynamical fermion simulations is that the up and down quark masses are much smaller than the masses we can simulate on the lattice .",
    "therefore , we usually extrapolate the data obtained at an order of magnitude larger sea quark masses to the physical point assuming some fitting ansatz . for the pseudo - scaler meson channel , the fitting ansatz can be justified by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , which provides a systematic expansion in terms of pion mass and momentum squared . however , the problem is that the region of applicability of chpt is not known _ a priori _ , and the lattice data , for instance obtained by the jlqcd collaboration , do not indicate the non - analytic behavior expected from the next - to - leading order chpt within simulated quark masses , _",

    "may also be considered as a mixed action calculation because the treatment of the ks - dirac operator is different between valence and sea ; while sea quarks are expressed by the fourth - root trick , valence quarks are treated by the quantum number projection .    preliminary results for the light hadron spectrum with the overlap or domain wall valence quarks on the @xmath14 ks - type sea quarks generated by the milc collaboration have been reported in @xcite .",
    "the valence mass is tuned by matching pseudo - scalar meson masses calculated with the domain wall and ks quarks  @xcite .",
    "the large splitting between the flavor singlet @xmath123 mass and other flavor octet meson masses should be explained by lattice qcd simulations .",
    "there have been a series of studies calculating the flavor singlet mass in unquenched simulations  @xcite .",
    "meson mass in @xmath11 as a function of @xmath124 quoted from  @xcite .",
    "results are obtained with pc  @xcite ( crosses ) , pw  @xcite ( bursts ) , pw  @xcite ( squares ) , and rc(tp )  @xcite ( diamond ( @xmath125 ) , octagon ( @xmath126 ) , fancy plus ( @xmath127 ) ) actions . ]",
    "[ fig : isosinglet ]    the continuum limit of the @xmath123 mass in @xmath11 was studied for the rc(t ) action  @xcite , and @xmath128 mev was obtained where the systematic errors come from the continuum and chiral extrapolations .",
    "this value seems consistent with the experimental value @xmath129 956  mev .",
    "however , the lattice result represents the value in the @xmath11 world for which the expectation for the iso - singlet meson mass is 861  mev ( method described in  @xcite ) or 715  mev ( from witten - veneziano formula ) . the above result from the rc(t ) action is consistent within the error .",
    "the rather large systematic error in the negative direction comes from continuum extrapolation .",
    "it seems difficult to obtain a reliable continuum extrapolation because of large statistical errors even if we add some points with different lattice spacings around @xmath130 2.5  gev .",
    "one would need a better method to improve the statistical signal .",
    "the chiral extrapolation should be carried out for both @xmath54 and @xmath131 as a linear function of @xmath54 , since reliable fit ansatz is not known .",
    "figure  [ fig : isosinglet ] shows the @xmath124 dependence of @xmath132 compiled in @xcite .",
    "the data show a similar dependence on @xmath124 except for crosses . the data at lighter two crosses  @xcite ( @xmath133 fm ) seems to be constant .",
    "squares  @xcite are obtained with @xmath134 noise method , while bursts  @xcite are obtained with truncated eigenvalue approximation ( tea ) method from the same sesam configuration  @xcite ( symbols are slightly shifted horizontally to avoid overlapping ) .",
    "they are consistent with each other while the tea has smaller statistical error .",
    "the value at physical point is different : @xmath135 mev with tea  @xcite and @xmath136 mev with @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "systematic study of chiral extrapolation with more data at smaller quark masses will clarify the difference of these data .",
    "the 1020% scaling violantion from @xmath138 error is also expected with unimproved gauge and quark actions even at @xmath139 gev lattice .",
    "the effect of @xmath140 and @xmath123 mixing can be treated by the partially quenched strange analysis within the @xmath11 simulations  @xcite . the quadratic mass matrix in the quark - flavor basis is obtained in  @xcite on the @xmath139 gev sesam configurations and they obtained @xmath141 mev and @xmath142 mev after the diagonarilzation of the mass matrix . while these individual numbers are still below the experimental numbers , the splitting is comparable to the experimental value .",
    "sometime ago , it was pointed out that the values of @xmath143 at @xmath144 disagree in the continuum limit between the pks action and pw ( rc(tp ) ) action  @xcite .",
    "the pks data in @xmath145 were extrapolated with a function @xmath146 , and the pw ( rc(tp ) ) data in @xmath147 were extrapolated with @xmath148 .",
    "this year reanalysis is done by adding new data with various lattice actions generated since 2000  @xcite .",
    "the universality is investigated in the quenched approximation by checking the consistency in the continuum limit among the various discretization method using the bayesian fitting approach  @xcite .",
    "all the data are simultaneously fitted with some constraints .",
    "the fit functions are polynomials which contains leading and higher order terms as a function of @xmath149 ( for the ks - type action only @xmath150 terms are included ) with a common continuum limit .",
    "the coefficients are constrained to stay within reasonable values by the bayesian prior .",
    "thus , they obtained a reasonable @xmath119 value for the consistent continuum limit .",
    "the continuum value is @xmath151 below and @xmath152 below from the previous analysis of the pk and pw actions respectively .",
    "they also investigated the universal continuum limit of @xmath153 and @xmath154 with more data ( lattice actions ) and obtained a reasonable @xmath119 values .",
    "these tests suggest the difficulty to estimate the systematic error of continuum extrapolation from single lattice action and the importance of the action improvement with many lattice spacings .",
    "the similar test for universality should eventually be done for unquenched simulations .",
    "the unquenched qcd simulations with dynamical up , down and strange quarks have made significant development over the past year .",
    "the progress has been more notable for the ks - type fermions for which an extensive work has been made both in pushing the simulations toward small quark masses and in analyzing the results .",
    "applying staggered chpt , it was shown that their data are consistent with the expected logarithmic chiral behavior once the pseudo scalar meson masses are decreased below @xmath102 gev .",
    "worries , however , regarding the field theoretic foundation of the fourth - root trick mandatory in @xmath14 simulations with the ks - type fermions still need to be clarified .",
    "simulations with the wilson - type fermions yielded an encouraging result that the meson spectrum moves progressively close to experiment as the number of dynamical quarks increases from @xmath155 to @xmath156 to @xmath17 .",
    "the largest issue is the long chiral extrapolation from heavy quark masses involved in reaching this result ; consistency with the expected chiral behavior is not established to satisfaction .",
    "hence algorithms which allow simulations with quark masses as light as used in the ks - type fermions are deeply needed . as we encountered for nucleon mass in the quenched case , cross checks between the ks - type and wilson - type fermions which will be made possible by such algorithms are very important for establishing unquenched predictions .",
