    "the distribution of major semiaxes ( separations ) of double and multiple stars is a fossil record of the conditions at star formation , as well as of the processes of dynamical evolution , including the dissociation of wide binaries produced= by encounters with massive objects : molecular clouds , spiral arms , etc .",
    "our long - standing interest in these topics has led us to investigate the frequency distribution of major semiaxes ( separations ) of wide binaries as a function of age . in the past , two main distributions of major semiaxes have been proposed :    @xmath4(1 ) a power - law frequency distribution _",
    "f(a ) _ @xmath5 _",
    "a_@xmath6    @xmath4(2 ) a gaussian distribution in log _ p _ or log _",
    "when @xmath7 = 1 in the power - law distribution , we have the well known oepik ( 1924 ) distribution ( od ) .",
    "on the other hand , kuiper ( 1935 , 1942 ) proposed the gaussian distribution , which was further elaborated by heintz ( 1969 ) .",
    "more recently , duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 , dm ) again proposed a gaussian distribution in log _ p _ , valid throughout the interval 1 @xmath2 log _ p _ ( days ) @xmath2 10 .",
    "our interest in the subject led us to construct a catalogue of= wide binaries in the solar vicinity , based on the catalogue of nearby stars of gliese and jahreiss ( 1991 , gj ) ; see poveda  ( 1994 ) for details .",
    "we have also constructed= a list of common proper motion binaries in the orion nebula cluster ( age 10@xmath8 years ) , extracted from the jones & walker ( 1988 ) catalogue of proper motions .",
    "( poveda & hernndez - alcntara 2003 ) . in our search for evolutionary effects in the observed distributions",
    "we have also looked at the oldest stars in the galaxy . for this purpose",
    "we constructed a catalogue ( allen  2000 ) of common proper motion companions to the lists of high velocity metal - poor stars of schuster ( 1988 ; 1989a ; 1989b ) , with ages of about @xmath9 years .    in all our catalogues , as well as in the luyten double star catalogue ( 1940 - 1987 , lds ) and in chanam & gould s catalogue ( 2004 , cg ) , we confirm our previous findings ( poveda  1997 ; poveda & allen 2004 ) , that the separations follow oepik s distribution ( od ) in an interval that is bounded at the lower end ( _ a _ @xmath1 100 au ) by the process of close binary and protoplanetary disk formation , and at large separations ( @xmath10 2500 au ) by the dissociation effects produced by encounters with massive objects .",
    "it can be shown that oepik s distribution in the plane ( _ n _ , log _ p _ ) is a horizontal straight line which is quite consistent ( within its error bars ) with dm distribution in the interval 2.44 @xmath2 log _ p _ ( years ) @xmath2 5.44 , which corresponds to 53 @xmath2 _ a _ ( au ) @xmath2 5500 .",
    "( poveda  2004 ) . since",
    "a great number of binaries from many different and largely independent sources confirm the validity of oepik s distribution , and since there is no stellar formation or single physical process able to produce a gaussian distribution valid in the interval 1 @xmath2 log _ p _ ( days ) @xmath2 10 , we propose to abandon the gaussian representation for _ a _ @xmath11 100 au . on the contrary ,",
    "oepik s distribution , which is equivalent to a surface density of secondaries @xmath12(_a _ ) @xmath1 _ a_@xmath13 , has a physical interpretation .",
    "in fact , this distribution is similar to the run of surface brightness in globular clusters ( king 1962 ) or to that of elliptical galaxies ( hubble s 1930 , or de vaucouleurs=92 1953 distributions ) . in both cases the physics behind such distributions",
    "is well known : it is the result of energy relaxation .",
    "the similarity of od to the surface brightness in clusters and elliptical galaxies indicates that binaries are not born alone ; at birth , they must be subject to a process of energy relaxation which can not be produced by two - body encounters , i.e. , stars must be formed in groups of multiplicity @xmath14 .",

    "with the purpose of detecting the effects of dissociation of weakly bound binaries with the passage of time , we constructed a catalogue of wide binaries ( 305 double systems , 26 triples and 3 quadruples with @xmath10 25 au ) , ( poveda  1994 ) .",
    "a sub - sample of this catalogue i.e. , all those systems with primaries of luminosity class v or iv and brighter than absolute magnitude @xmath22 9 is very important , as it is volume - complete . to show this , in figure 1 we plot _ n_(log _",

    "s _ and distances to give projected separations in astronomical units . however , a statistical relation between the average value of _ a _ for a given projected separation _ s _ , namely @xmath26 = 1.41_s _ ( couteau 1960 ) , can be used to estimate for each binary a value of @xmath26 .",
    "figure 2a shows for our volume - complete sample the run of the cumulative distribution @xmath27 .",
    "an inspection of figure 2a shows that this sample closely follows oepik s distribution in the interval 2.12 @xmath2 log @xmath26 @xmath2 3.42 , i.e. , 133 @xmath2 @xmath26 ( au ) @xmath2 2,640 . to evaluate quantitatively",
    "how reliably oepik = b4s distribution represents the data , we shall use the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , which was developed precisely for cumulative distributions and where no arbitrary binning of the data is required , ( as is the case in the popular chi - square test ) . in figure 2a each binary is plotted , thus _ n_(log @xmath26 ) increases one by one .",
    "by least squares we fitted to the data points a number of straight lines , each one defined in the interval ( log @xmath28 , log @xmath29 ) , until we found the best straight line that minimized the residuals and maximized the interval ( log @xmath28 , log @xmath29 ) , i.e. , the one giving the largest interval ( log @xmath28 , log @xmath29 ) in which oepik s distribution reliably represents the cumulative distribution of separations .    in figure 2a",
    "we give the equation of the straight line that best represents the data , in the interval log @xmath28 = 2.1248 , log @xmath29 = 3.4214 ( @xmath28 @xmath30 133 au , @xmath29 @xmath31 2,640 au ) .",

    "in fact , in a theoretical paper , weinberg  ( 1987 ) estimated that a binary with a major semiaxis smaller than 2000 au has a probability of one to survive ( against dissociation by giant molecular clouds ) during 10 billion years , yet a binary with @xmath26 @xmath30 12,600 au after two billion years has a probability of survival of only 0.5 .",

    "to further examine this hypothesis , we analyze the distribution of major semiaxes of the binaries in a very young group ( @xmath34 years ) .",

    "taking advantage of the jones & walker ( 1988 ) catalogue of proper motions of the stars in the orion nebula cluster , we have identified 68 candidate common proper motion= binaries ( poveda & hernndez - alcntara , 2003 ) .",
    "jones & walker s determinations of proper motions and infrared magnitudes for 1053 stars of the orion nebula cluster are appropriate for our work , because of the proper motions accuracy ( @xmath37  0.1  arcsec / century ) and also because the faint limiting magnitude ( @xmath38 13 ) .",
    "moreover , the one- million year age of the cluster allows us to look into the = 93almost=94 primeval distribution of major semiaxes .",
    "the cumulative distribution of major semiaxes for this sample of orion binaries follows very neatly oepik s distribution , ( see figure 3 ) .",

    "note that in the interval @xmath39 log @xmath40 ( 10 arcsec @xmath41 arcsec ) which includes 285 binaries , this distribution is consistent with oepik s , which in this plane would be a horizontal straight line . for larger separations ,",
    "the distribution becomes depopulated similarly to what we found to occur for other samples of binaries ( see text ) .",

    "chanam and gould ( 2004 , cg ) have assembled a catalogue of wide= binaries based on the revised luyten nltt catalogue by gould & salim ( 2003 ) and salim & gould ( 2003 ) .",
    "cg identified 999 common proper motion pairs .",
    "good photometry allowed them to construct a reduced proper motion diagram for their binaries .",

    "the large number of binaries allows to display this frequency distribution with small sampling fluctuations . in this figure",
    "we see clearly that @xmath42 is essentially constant in the interval 1 @xmath43 log _ s _ @xmath43 1.55 . for larger separations , i.e. , _ s _ @xmath44 35.5 arcsec",

    "f(a ) _ @xmath51 is equivalent to a surface density of secondaries @xmath52(_a _ ) @xmath53 .",
    "this surface density distribution is reminiscent of the surface density of stars in globular clusters and elliptical= galaxies ( king 1962 ; hubble 1930 ; de vaucouleurs 1953 ) .",
    "the physics involved in these distributions is well understood . in the case of globular clusters we have what we may call secular relaxation , i.e. , a process in which two body encounters gradually modify the energy of a given star over a time scale much greater than the crossing time ;",
    "in the case of elliptical galaxies , what we have is a case of initially violent= relaxation , in which the energy of the stars changes rapidly because the potential of= the stellar system ( galaxy ) changes rapidly due to an initial stellar collapse ( van albada 1982 ) or because of galaxy mergers . in the first case ( secular relaxation )",
    "there is equipartition of energy and therefore a tendency for the lighter stars to diffuse to the outer parts of the globular cluster ( this has been observationally confirmed ) ; on the contrary , in the case of violent relaxation there is no equipartition of energy and hence no segregation of stellar masses , which indeed is the case in elliptical galaxies ( no color gradients are observed ) .",
    "the process of energy relaxation involves the interaction of several close stars ( _ n _ @xmath54 3 ) , very early in the stellar history .",
    "in fact , the wide binaries in the orion nebula cluster follow od even though they are still in the pre - main sequence phase ( t @xmath2 10@xmath8 years ) .",
    "we conclude that the process of energy relaxation is not related to interactions with stars in the cluster environment , but rather it is the result of very early interactions in multiple systems .",
    "this suggests that stars are formed in multiple systems that quickly relax and assume od , with the possible ejection of one or more single stars .",
    "the common proper motion binaries in orion show that there is not enough time for the reverse process to take place , i.e. the formation of double and multiple stars by capture from stars in the cluster .    in the process of star formation",
    ", the transition from gas to stellar dynamics may lead to a virialized multiple system where 2_t _ @xmath55 , or to a non virialized one , depending on the initial conditions prevailing in the transition phase .",

    "we meet the conditions of violent relaxation , i.e. , the collapse of the proto - stars will produce a rapid change in the gravitational potential experienced by the stars . in this conditions some stars will be accelerated to velocities larger than those associated with a virialized multiple system .",
    "an _ n_-body simulation of this scenario was realized by the present authors many years ago ( poveda  1967 ) with the purpose of finding an alternative explanation for the formation of runaway stars . in those simulations we found not only runaway stars but also that the binaries formed followed oepik s distribution ( allen 1968 ; poveda   2004 ) .",
