    "the main result of this paper expresses a subfactor planar algebra of finite depth as a quotient of a universal planar algebra on finitely many generators by a planar ideal generated by finitely many relations .",
    "such a presentation is often referred to as a skein theory for the planar algebra .",
    "in addition , we also show that such a planar algebra is generated by a single element subject to finitely many relations .",
    "our presentation is universal in the following sense .",
    "we specify a small set of ` templates ' for relations in any finite depth subfactor planar algebra . if @xmath0 is one such with depth at most @xmath1 , taking a basis of @xmath2 to be a generating set and specialising these templates to @xmath0 presents it .",
    "skein theories for planar algebras have been the subject of several studies beginning with @xcite for the group subfactor planar algebra and @xcite and @xcite for irreducible depth two planar algebras to the more recent @xcite for the @xmath3 planar algebras , @xcite for a unified treatment of the ade planar algebras , @xcite for the haagerup subfactor planar algebra and @xcite for the extended haagerup subfactor planar algebra .",
    "one of the main results of each of these papers is a nice skein theory for a finite depth subfactor planar algebra or a family of such .",
    "the methods of this paper do not by any means give any such nice skein theories for finite depth subfactor planar algebras .",
    "the point is to show that all such planar algebras have a skein theory , or equivalently , a finite presentation . in particular",
    ", we make no attempt at being parsimonious with the relations .    in section 2",
    "we quickly recall basic definitions and properties of subfactor planar algebras .",
    "section 3 , which makes no mention of planar algebras , is about certain relationships between tangles that we call templates and certain relationships between templates that we call consequences .",
    "section 4 gives a finite presentation of a finite depth subfactor planar algebra . in section 5",
    "we make a couple of simple observations including the single generation of finite depth subfactor planar algebras .",
    "the purpose of this section is to fix our notations and conventions regarding planar algebras .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with planar algebras as in @xcite or in @xcite so we will be very brief .",
    "planar algebras are collections of vector spaces equipped with an action by the ` coloured operad of planar tangles ' .",
    "the vector spaces are indexed by the set @xmath4 , whose elements are called colours .",
    "we endow this set with the partial order that restricts to the usual order on @xmath5 and such that @xmath6 are incomparable and less than 1 .",
    "we will not define a tangle but merely note the following features .",
    "each tangle has an external box , denoted @xmath7 , and a ( possibly empty ) ordered collection of internal non - nested boxes denoted @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "each box has an even number ( again possibly 0 ) of points marked on its boundary .",
    "a box with @xmath11 points on its boundary is called an @xmath12-box or said to be of colour @xmath12 .",
    "there is also given a collection of disjoint curves each of which is either closed , or joins a marked point on one of the boxes to another such .",
    "for each box having at least one marked point on its boundary , one of the regions ( = connected components of the complement of the boxes and curves ) that impinge on its boundary is distinguished and marked with a @xmath13 placed near its boundary .",
    "the whole picture is to be planar and each marked point on a box must be the end - point of one of the curves .",
    "finally , there is given a chequerboard shading of the regions such that the @xmath13-region of any box is shaded white .",
    "a @xmath14-box is said to be @xmath15 box if the region touching its boundary is white and a @xmath16 box otherwise .",
    "a @xmath14 without the @xmath17 qualification will always refer to @xmath15 .",
    "a tangle is said to be an @xmath12-tangle if its external box is of colour @xmath12 .",
    "tangles are defined only upto a planar isotopy preserving the @xmath13 s , the shading and the ordering of the internal boxes .",
    "we illustrate several important tangles in figure [ fig : imptangles ] .    ) , height=321 ]    this figure , uses the following notational device introduced in @xcite . a strand in a tangle with a _ non - negative integer _",
    ", say @xmath18 , adjacent to it will indicate a @xmath18-cable of that strand , i.e. , a parallel cable of @xmath18 strands , in place of the one actually drawn .    a useful labelling convention for tangles is to decorate its tangle symbol , such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , with subscripts and a superscript that give the colours of its internal boxes and external box respectively . with this",
    ", we may dispense with showing the shading , which is then unambiguously determined .",
    "the basic operation that one can perform on tangles is substitution of one into a box of another .",
    "if @xmath21 is a tangle that has some internal boxes @xmath22 of colours @xmath23 and if @xmath24 are arbitrary tangles of colours @xmath25 , then we may substitute @xmath26 into the box @xmath27 of @xmath21 for each @xmath18 - such that the ` @xmath13 s match ' - to get a new tangle that will be denoted @xmath28 .",
    "the collection of tangles along with the substitution operation is called the coloured operad of planar tangles .",
    "a planar algebra @xmath0 is an algebra over the coloured operad of planar tangles . by this , is meant the following : @xmath0 is a collection @xmath29 of vector spaces and linear maps @xmath30 for each @xmath31-tangle @xmath21 with internal boxes of colours @xmath32 .",
    "the collection of maps is to be ` compatible with substitution of tangles and renumbering of internal boxes ' in an obvious manner . for a planar algebra @xmath0",
    ", each @xmath33 acquires the structure of an associative , unital algebra with multiplication defined using the tangle @xmath34 and unit defined to be @xmath35 .    among planar algebras ,",
    "the ones that we will be interested in are the subfactor planar algebras .",
    "these are complex , finite - dimensional and connected in the sense that each @xmath33 is a finite - dimensional complex vector space and @xmath36 are one dimensional .",
    "they have a positive modulus @xmath37 , meaning that closed loops in a tangle @xmath21 contribute a multiplicative factor of @xmath37 in @xmath38 .",
    "they are spherical in that for a @xmath14-tangle @xmath21 , the function @xmath38 is not just planar isotopy invariant but also an isotopy invariant of the tangle regarded as embedded on the surface of the two sphere .",
    "further , each @xmath33 is a @xmath39-algebra in such a way that for an @xmath31-tangle @xmath21 with internal boxes of colours @xmath32 and for @xmath40 , the equality @xmath41 holds , where @xmath42 is the adjoint of the tangle @xmath21 - which , by definition , is obtained from @xmath21 by reflecting it .",
    "finally , the trace @xmath43 defined by : @xmath44 is postulated to be a faithful , positive ( normalised ) trace for each @xmath45 .",
    "any subfactor planar algebra @xmath0 ( of modulus @xmath37 ) contains the distinguished jones projections @xmath46 for @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 and their non - normalised versions @xmath49 .",
    "a subfactor planar algebra @xmath0 is said to be of finite depth if there is a positive integer @xmath1 such that @xmath50 and the smallest such @xmath1 is said to be the depth of @xmath0 .",

    "all subsequent tangle figures , we suppress drawing the external box of tangles and adopt the convention that the @xmath13 of the external box ( if it is a @xmath1-box with @xmath57 ) is at the top left corner .",
    "shaded regions of a tangle will be to the left traversing any string along the direction indicated on it .",

    ". then @xmath0 is generated by a single @xmath259-box .    as a planar algebra , @xmath0 is generated by @xmath2 . since @xmath2 is a finite - dimensional @xmath39-algebra , it is singly generated , by say @xmath260 . by adding a multiple of @xmath261 to @xmath262",
    ", we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath263 ( recall that @xmath264 is the normalised picture trace on @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus the planar algebra generated by @xmath262 and @xmath265 contains @xmath2 and must be the whole of @xmath0 .",
    "now consider the element @xmath266 defined by    figure [ generator ] .",
    "it should be clear that applying suitable annular tangles to @xmath267 yields non - zero ( since @xmath263 ) multiples of @xmath262 and @xmath265 .",

    "what proposition [ single ] asserts is that @xmath271 maps onto any subfactor planar algebra of depth @xmath1 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether when a finite depth planar algebra @xmath0 is presented as a quotient of @xmath271 as above , the kernel is a finitely generated planar ideal .",
    "a standard proof shows that this is indeed so .",
    "[ equiv ] let @xmath0 be a planar algebra and suppose that for finite label sets @xmath208 and @xmath272 there are surjective planar algebra maps @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "the ideal @xmath275 is a finitely generated planar ideal of @xmath209 if and only if @xmath276 is a finitely generated planar ideal of @xmath277 .",
    "first note that universality of @xmath209 and @xmath277 yield ( possibly non - unique ) planar algebra maps @xmath278 and @xmath279 that satisfy @xmath280 and @xmath281 .    by symmetry",
    ", it suffices to prove one implication .",
    "suppose that @xmath282 for a finite subset @xmath283 .",

    "we claim that @xmath286 .",
    "clearly @xmath287 and so @xmath288 .",
    "the other inclusion needs a little work .",
    "first observe that @xmath289 implies that for all @xmath290 , @xmath291 .",
    "to see this we may reduce easily to the case that @xmath292 where @xmath21 is a @xmath93-tangle and @xmath293 .",
    "then @xmath294 this may be expressed as a telescoping sum of @xmath101 terms indexed by @xmath295 where the @xmath296 term is given by @xmath297 each of these terms is clearly in the planar ideal generated by @xmath298 and hence in @xmath299 .",
