    "the model assumes that endothelial cells secrete an autocrine , diffusive chemoattractant to attract one another .",
    "due to the resulting attractive forces between the endothelial cells , the cells aggregate into a spheroid - like configuration . if the chemoattractant sensitivity of the endothelial cells is restricted to the interfaces between the endothelial cells and the surrounding ecm by means of a contact inhibition mechanism , the spheroids sprout in microvascular - network - like configurations .",
    "although our group @xcite and others @xcite have suggested numerous plausible alternative mechanisms for de novo vasculogenesis and sprouting , in absence of a definitive explanatory model of angiogenesis we have selected the contact inhibition model for pragmatic reasons : it agrees reasonably well with experimental observation @xcite , it focuses on a chemotaxis mechanism amenable to genetic analysis , and it has a proven applicability in studies of tumor angiogenesis @xcite , age - related macular degeneration @xcite , and toxicology @xcite .    the computational model is based on a hybrid , cellular potts and partial differential equation model @xcite .",

    "whether tip cells occupy sprout tips , we simulated the model with a tip cell fraction of @xmath28 , in accordance with published observations : 11.9% in a huvec monolayer @xcite and @xmath2930% in the growing of the retinal vasculature @xcite . because we assume that tip cell fate is strongly inhibited in a monolayer and tip cells are overexpressed in the growing front , we set the tip cell fraction at 20% , which is roughly the average of the two . at the end of each simulation we detected sprouts with tip cells on the tip using an automated method , as detailed in the materials and methods section .",

    "= 0.2 . ]",
    "altogether , the computational screening presented in this section identified three tip cell parameters that affect tip cell position in the sprout and the morphology of the networks formed in our computational model : reduced secretion of the chemoattractant , reduced sensitivity to the chemoattractant , and increased tip - ecm adhesion .",
    "it is possible , however , that these effects are due to spatial or temporal averaging of tip and stalk cell parameters , not due to interaction of two different cell types .",
    "the next section will introduce a control for such effects .",
    "the computational screening highlighted three tip cell parameters that affected both the position of tip cells in the sprouts and the morphology of the networks : ( 1 ) increased tip - cell ecm adhesion , ( 2 ) reduced chemoattractant secretion by tip cells , and ( 3 ) reduced chemoattractant sensitivity of tip cells . because it was unsure whether these effects were due to ( a ) the differential cell behavior of tip and stalk cells , or ( b ) due to temporal or spatial averaging of the parameters differentially assigned to tip and stalk cells , we compared the results against a control model that had only one cell type with `` averaged '' parameters : @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the tip cell parameter value and @xmath51 the stalk cell parameter value .    for each of the three parameters identified in the first step of the computational screening , we compared the morphologies formed in the control model after 10000 mcs with the morphologies formed in the original model with mixed cell types ( fig  [ fig : tcpropmetric ] ) .",

    "p - values were obtained with a welch s t - test for the null hypothesis that the mean of mixed model and the control model are identical . ]",
    "we next tested if networks formed in the `` mixed '' model differed from those formed in the corresponding `` averaged '' model for tip cell fractions ranging from 0 ( no tip cells ) to 1 ( only tip cells ) .",
    "although the measures differed for individual morphometrics and tip cell fractions in all three scenarios ( figs  [ fig : tcpropmetric]*c - e , h - j , m - o * ) , only in the model where tip cells had reduced chemoattractant sensitivity all morphometrics differed significantly for practically all tip cell fractions tested ( figs  [ fig : tcpropmetric]*m*-*o * ) .",
    "the analysis was repeated for three additional parameter values per scenario ( ) ; although in all three scenarios the morphometrics differed between the `` mixed '' and `` averaged '' models for a number of tip cell fractions , only in the `` reduced chemoattractant sensitivity '' scenario the differential behavior of tip and stalk cells consistently affected the morphometrics .",
    "we thus retained only this model for further analysis .",
    "the parameter screening indicated that tip cells that are less sensitive to the chemoattractant than stalk cells tend to move to the front of the sprouts , affecting in this way the network morphology .",
    "to better understand now such differential chemoattractant sensitivity can affect angiogenic sprouting , we analyzed the migration of a cell pair consisting of one tip cell and one stalk cell .",
    "as shown in figs  [ fig : cellpair]*a*-*c * , cell pairs with a large difference in the chemoattractant sensitivity migrated much further than cell pairs with a smaller or no difference in chemoattractant sensitivity . to quantify this observation , we used the mccutcheon index @xcite , which is the ratio of the distance between the initial and final position , and the total path length .",
    "as shown in fig  [ fig : cellpair]*d * , the mccutcheon index decreases as the tip cell s chemoattractant sensitivity approaches that of the stalk cell . indicating that a strong difference in chemotaxis causes the cell pair to move along a straighter path .",

    "the resulting layered configuration with tip cells at the outer rim drives a drift away from the lacuna ( fig  [ fig : ptcvsdtc]*q * ) : due to their stronger chemoattractant sensitivity , the stalk cells attempt to move to the center of the configuration , pushing the tip cells away , thus leading to directional migration driven by the mechanism outlined in the previous section ( see also ref .",

    "the comparative , computational model analysis of the role of tip cells in angiogenesis , predicted that  among the models tested  a model where tip cells show reduced sensitivity to an autocrine chemoattractant best matches tip cell phenomenology : the tip cells lead the sprouts , and facilitate the formation of vascular networks of regular morphology for tip cell fractions of up to around 0.2 .",

    "the chemokine cxcl12 and its receptor cxcr4 @xcite are both upregulated in tip cells @xcite , suggesting that tip cells would have higher , not lower sensitivity to cxcl12 signaling than stalk cells .",
    "interestingly , cxcl12 and cxcr4 are key components of a self - generated gradient mechanism for directional tissue migration in the lateral line primordium mechanisms @xcite .",
    "because of the key role of cxcl12/cxcr4 in angiogenesis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) it is therefore tempting to speculate that cxcl12/cxcr4 may be part of a similar , self - generated gradient mechanism during angiogenesis .",
    "however , because cxcl12 expression is upregulated in tip cells relative to stalk cells , not downregulated , we will focus here on a third receptor / ligand pair differentially expressed in tip and stalk cells : apj and apelin .",
    "apj is a receptor for the endothelial chemoattractant apelin @xcite that is secreted by endothelial cells @xcite .",
    "apelin expression is upregulated in tip cells @xcite , whereas its receptor apj is not detected in tip cells @xcite .",

    "the chemoattractant is secreted at the same rate by tip and stalk cells , whereas apelin is preferentially expressed in tip cells .",
    "the next section will therefore add preferential secretion of apelin by tip cells to the model , and test if and how this changes the predictions of our model .",
    "the computational analyses outlined in the previous sections suggest that apelin and its receptor apj might act as an autocrine chemoattractant in the way predicted by our model : both stalk cells and tip cells secrete apelin and apj @xcite and the tip cells do not express the apj receptor @xcite .",
    "gene expression analyses @xcite also suggest that tip cells secrete apelin at a higher rate than stalk cells .",
    "we therefore tested if the simulation results still held if we changed the model assumptions accordingly : in addition to a reduced chemoattractant sensitivity in tip cells ( @xmath64 ) , we assumed tip cells secrete chemoattractant at a higher rate than stalk cells : @xmath65 .",
    "although the absence of apj expression in tip cells suggests that tip cells are insensitive to the chemoattractant , @xmath66 , to reflect the phenomenological observation that endothelial cells are attracted to one another , we set @xmath67 . such intercellular attraction could , e.g. , be mediated by cell - cell adhesion , by alternative chemoattractant - receptor pairs ( e.g. , cxcr4-cxcl12 @xcite ) , or by means of mechanical endothelial cell interactions via the extracellular matrix@xcite .",
    "fig  [ fig : dtc_apelin ] shows how the apelin secretion rate in tip cells ( @xmath68 ) affects the morphology of the vascular networks formed in our model , as expressed by the compactness .",

    "the networks became more compact and exhibit thicker branches for tip cell chemoattractant secretion rates of @xmath70 .",
    "this result does not agree with the observation that apelin promotes vascular outgrowth @xcite .",
    "the increased compactness for @xmath70 is a model artifact : stalk cells were so strongly attracted to tip cells that they engulfed the tip cells and thereby inhibited the tip cell phenotype .",
    "a similar increase in compactness and branch thickness is observed in a model where tip cells are not sensitive to the chemoattractant ( ) , which indicates that a too large apelin secretion rate of tip cells destabilizes sprout elongation .",
    "altogether , these results suggest that , if the apelin secretion rate of tip cells does not become more than ten times larger than that of stalk cells , our model produces similar results independent of the tip cell secretion rate of apelin .     for tip cell apelin secretion rates of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73,@xmath74 , and @xmath75 as insets .",

    "we studied two cases , reflecting the two extremes in the range of known molecular mechanisms regulating tip and stalk cell differentiation . in the first case",
    ", we assumed that endothelial cells are differentiated stably between a tip and stalk cell phenotype within the characteristic time scale of angiogenic development ( approximately 24 to 48 hours ) . in the second case",
    ", we assumed a much more rapidly - acting lateral inhibition mechanism , mediated by dll4 and notch . here",
    "endothelial cells can switch back and forth between tip and stalk cell fate at time scales of the same order of cell motility .",
    "our analysis showed that in a model driven by contact - inhibited chemotaxis to a growth factor secreted by endothelial cells , tip cells that respond less to the chemoattractant move to the tips of the sprouts and speed up sprout extension . under the same conditions , more regular and more dense networks formed if endothelial cells switched between tip and stalk cell fate due to lateral inhibition .",
    "this limits tip cells to growing sprouts ; due to their stronger chemoattractant sensitivity the stalk cells push the tip cells forwards leading to faster sprout extension in a mechanism reminiscent of a `` self - generated gradient mechanism '' @xcite .",
    "we next asked if a growth factor with the predicted properties is involved in angiogenic sprouting .",
    "to this end we looked for matching , differential gene expression patterns in published data sets of gene expression in tip and stalk cells .",
    "in particular the apelin - apj ligand - receptor pair turned out to be a promising candidate : apelin is a chemoattractant for endothelial cells that is secreted by endothelial cells and the receptor apj is only detected in stalk cells . in agreement with our simulations , _ in vitro",
    "_ experiments on endothelial spheroids showed that inhibition of apelin or its receptor apj reduced _ in vitro _",
    "spheroid sprouting .",
    "thus the reversed bottom - up simulation approach employed in this study helped identify a candidate molecule mediating the interaction between tip and stalk cells during angiogenesis .",
    "our approach was inspired by a prior study that used a computational model to identify what cell behavior changed when endothelial cells were treated with certain growth factors @xcite .",
    "this study used an agent - based , 3d model of angiogenesis in which sprouts extend from a spheroid . with a genetic algorithm the parameters for which the model reproduces experimental results are derived .",
    "in this way long _",
    "_ @xcite could hypothesize what changes in cell behavior the growth factors caused and successfully derived how certain growth factors affect cell behavior in 3d sprouting assays . here , we used a similar approach to study what behavior makes tip cells lead sprouts and affect network formation , using high - throughput parameter studies instead of objective optimization approaches .",
    "tip - stalk cell interactions have been studied before with several hypothesis - driven models where specific behavior was assigned to the tip cells based on experimental observations , and tip cells were either defined as the leading cell @xcite or tip cell selection was modeled such that the tip cell could only differentiate at the sprout tip @xcite .",
    "these models have been used to study how extracellular matrix ( ecm ) density @xcite , ecm degradation @xcite , ecm inhomogeneity @xcite , a porous scaffold @xcite , cell migration and proliferation @xcite , tip cell chemotaxis @xcite and toxins @xcite affect sprouting and angiogenesis .",
    "thus these studies asked how a specific hypothesis of tip cell behavior and tip cell position affected the other mechanisms and observables in the simulation .",
    "our approach aims to develop new models for the interaction between tip and stalk cells that can reproduce biological observation .",
    "these new hypotheses can be further refined in hypothesis - driven model studies , as we do here , e.g. , in fig  [ fig : dtc_apelin ] .",
    "in order to make this ",
    "reversed approach possible , we have simplified the underlying genetic regulatory networks responsible for tip - stalk cell differentiation .",
    "these molecular networks , in particular dll4-notch signaling , have been modeled in detail by bentley _",
    "their model describes a strand of endothelial cells , and was used to study how lateral inhibition via dll4-notch signaling in interaction with vegf signaling participates in tip cell selection . with this model bentley and",
    "coworkers predicted that the shape of the vegf gradient determines the rate of tip cell selection , and that for very high levels of vegf the intracellular levels of dll4 and vegfr2 oscillate .",
    "based on their experimental observations that tip cells migrate within a sprout , cell movement has been added to the model by allowing cells to switch positions along the sprout @xcite .",
    "bentley and coworkers reproduced tip cell migration in the sprout and showed that the vegfr2 levels in a cell determine the chance of an endothelial cell to become a tip cell .",
    "the migration of tip cells in a sprouts was further studied using a model that included a cell migration model @xcite .",
    "bentley and coworkers @xcite thus showed that the differences in ve - cadherin expression between tip and stalk cells could cause tip cell migration to the sprout tip .",
    "altogether , these models gave useful insights in the role of dll4-notch signaling and vegf signaling in tip cell selection in a growing sprout . here , instead of focusing at single sprouts , we focused on the scale of a vascular network . by combining a tip cell selection model with a cell based model of angiogenesis , we showed that tip cell selection can aid the development of dense networks by limiting the destabilizing effects of tip cells .",
    "the model prediction that tip cells respond less to a chemoattractant secreted by all endothelial cells fits with the expression pattern of the chemoattractant apelin , which is secreted by all endothelial cells and of which the receptor is not detect in tip cells .",
    "previous studies indicated that apelin induces angiogenesis _ in vitro _",
    "apelin - apj signaling is necessary for vascular development in _ in vivo _",
    "systems such as in the mouse retina @xcite , frog embryo @xcite , and chicken chorioallantoic membrane @xcite .",
    "furthermore , high levels of vascularization in human glioblastoma are correlated with high expression levels of apelin and apj @xcite . based on these observations",
    "apelin is considered to be a pro - angiogenic factor . similar to other pro - angiogenic factors such as vegf @xcite",
    ", apelin is expressed near areas where blood vessels develop and apelin expression is induced by hypoxia @xcite .",
    "the pro - angiogenic role of apelin is linked to its role as a chemoattractant @xcite and mitogenic factor @xcite .",
    "however , the role of apelin in proliferation may be disputed because apelin did not promote proliferation in a series of sprouting assays with human umbilical vein endothelial cells , human umbilical arterial endothelial cells , and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells @xcite .",
    "our models propose a scenario where apelin can promote angiogenesis as an autocrine chemoattractant , in contrast to the previous studies where the source of apelin was external .",
    "such a mechanism would fit with the observation that the apelin receptor apj is only expressed in stalk cells .",
    "inhibition of sprouting is manifested as a decrease in the number of sprouts .",
    "as mentioned previously , apelin may promote proliferation , and thus inhibition of apelin signaling may results in a reduced proliferation rate .",
    "a reduced proliferation rate could result in a reduced sprout length , but , a reduced number of sprouts is an unlikely effect of a decreased proliferation rate .",
    "this indicates that the mechanism that drives sprouting is affected by the inhibition of apelin signaling .",
    "however , whereas in the model inhibition of apelin signaling inhibits sprouting for all tested cases , in the experimental assays the effects of apelin or apj inhibition depended on the fraction of tip cells and the environment . in mixed spheroids , apelin and apj inhibition reduced sprouting in spheroids embedded in vegf - enriched collagen . in cd34- spheroids ,",
    "i.e. , spheroids enriched with stalk cells , apelin or apj inhibition had no effect in plain collagen and slightly enhanced sprouting in a vegf rich environment .",
    "this suggests that , in a vegf rich environment , apelin - apj signaling inhibits sprouting by stalk cells .",
    "vegf has been shown to induce tip cell fate @xcite , as well as apj expression @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unclear how the combination of a vegf rich environment and apelin signaling could inhibit sprouting and therefore further experiments studying the interaction between vegf and apelin signaling in vascular sprouting are needed .",
    "further _ in vitro _",
    "experiments are also needed to study the effects of apelin signaling on network formation , that follows the initial sprouting phase .",
    "our model predicts that inhibition of apelin signaling would also block network formation ( see ) .",
    "however , because the 3d sprouting assay does not mimic vascular network formation , this prediction could not be verified experimentally .",
    "the importance of vegf in our validation experiments suggests that we can not ignore vegf in our tip cell selection model .",
    "as mentioned above , vegf may interact with apelin - apj signaling .",
    "furthermore , vegf @xcite and apelin @xcite are both involved in endothelial cell proliferation . besides the link between vegf and apelin ,",
    "vegf is also involved in tip cell selection .",
    "dll4-notch signaling and vegf signaling interact directly in two ways .",
    "first , dll4 is upregulated by signaling between vegf and vegf receptor 2 ( vegfr2 ) @xcite .",
    "second , dll4-notch signaling downregulates vegfr2 @xcite and upregulates vegf receptor 1 ( vegfr1 ) @xcite , which acts as a decoy receptor for vegf @xcite .",
    "because _ in vivo _ vegf acts as an external guidance cue for angiogenesis , the interplay between vegf signaling and dll4-notch signaling could promote tip cell selection in the growing sprouts .",
    "the expression levels of vegfr2 also directly reduce adhesion between cells because vegfr2-vegf binding causes endocytosis of ve - cadherin @xcite .",
    "this reduced adhesion may enable cells with high vegfr2 levels , such as tip cells , to migrate to the sprout tip @xcite . because of this complex interplay between between cell behavior and dll4 , notch , vegf , and the vegf receptors , future studies will replace the simplified tip cell selection model for a tip cell selection model with explicit levels of dll4 , notch , vegf , vegfr1 and vegfr2 , and link those levels directly to tip and stalk cell behaviors .",
    "furthermore , future studies should include explicit levels of apelin and apj to study if and how vegf - induced apelin secretion affects network formation .",
    "such an extended model will provide more insight into how the interaction between stalk cell proliferation @xcite , ecm association of vegf @xcite , and pericyte recruitment and interaction @xcite , which all have been linked to apelin signaling and/or vegf signaling , affects angiogenesis .",

    "<S> , a highly motile type of endothelial cell , called the tip cell , migrates from the blood vessels followed by stalk cells , an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout . to get more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis , we extended an existing computational model of vascular network formation based on the cellular potts model with tip and stalk differentiation , without making a priori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells . to predict potential differences </S>",
    "<S> , we looked for parameter values that make tip cells ( a ) move to the sprout tip , and ( b ) change the morphology of the angiogenic networks . </S>",
    "<S> the screening predicted that if tip cells respond less effectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells , they move to the tips of the sprouts , which impacts the morphology of the networks . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip and stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant apelin and its receptor apj may match the model prediction . to test the model prediction we inhibited apelin signaling in our model and in an _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> model of angiogenic sprouting , and found that in both cases inhibition of apelin or of its receptor apj reduces sprouting . </S>",
    "<S> based on the prediction of the computational model , we propose that the differential expression of apelin and apj yields a `` self - generated '' gradient mechanisms that accelerates the extension of the sprout . </S>"
