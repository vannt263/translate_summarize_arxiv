    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are magnetically driven gigantic events whose disturbance in the outer corona influences the space - weather to a wide range . when propagating from the sun , they appear to have three - part structure in white light @xcite with leading edge , core and cavity .",
    "although not quite clear in the observations , the cavity is supposed to have its connections in the source regions on the sun and is approximated by a coherent , large scale magnetic magnetic flux rope ( mfr ) , manifested by twisted magnetic field lines .",
    "a recent statistical study suggests that at least 40% of cmes observed by space borne instruments have a clear mfr structure @xcite .",
    "many studies from space and ground based observations suggested that this mfr structure in the outer corona is an evolved form of filaments seen in h@xmath0 or sigmodal structure in soft x - rays in the so called magnetic active regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) on the sun .",
    "central to the space - weather phenomena and the sun - earth connections of the cmes having signatures of this predicted mfr topology , a majority of past and current scientific research dwells on basic questions like how such mfr like structures formed or comes into existence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , what are the initiating conditions in the source active region ( e.g. , @xcite ) and what kind of mfr evolution drive its outward propagation ( e.g. , @xcite ) in the extended corona and interplanetary medium .",
    "two strong ideas that the past and current observations on the sun implied were emergence of the mfr from beneath the inner photosphere and formation of the mfr from sheared arcade . in the process of active region formation while it emerges , the mfr structure would emerge as a bipolar region and equilibrates with the overlying , pre - existing structure @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the bodily emergence of the mfr @xcite showed the formation of sheared arcade in the corona after the mfr axis reached the photosphere . in the case of fully emerged active region , the equilibrated mfr structure in the form of sheared arcade evolves to full fledged mfr . based on these ideas ,",
    "different theoretical and observational models have been proposed and constructed @xcite . in all of them ,",
    "twisted mfr or sheared arcade which is a source of magnetic helicity , is the basic ingredient of pre - eruptive magnetic configuration .",
    "@xcite showed how helical mfrs can be formed by reconnection in a sheared coronal arcade . during the progressive reconnection phase ,",
    "the magnetic flux gets canceled , transforming the magnetic field lines in the sheared arcade along the magnetic inversion line to winding , helical field lines about a common axis of nearly formed mfr @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite proposed a mechanism for the formation of helical field lines from the reconnection of less sheared arcade along the polarity inversion line and also to build up the mfr . submerging motion of fluxes about",
    "the pil also plays vital role in bringing less sheared to highly sheared arcade .",
    "usually the reconnection location is associated with the photospheric flux cancellation @xcite and is evidently reported to be involved with the mfr formation and its eruption @xcite .    in the low corona , triggering and driving of mfr eruption is another important step in the eruption process .",
    "filament , prominence or sigmoid eruptions modeled by the numerical and theoretical constructions of mfrs have been successful in many respects of observed eruption features . the physics of these models essentially based on loss of equilibrium of mfr after reaching a critical height @xcite , kink instability due to exceeding mfr s twist @xcite , torus instability @xcite of the mfr when there is a rapid decline of the background field in the direction of the expansion of the mfr .    in the case of source active regions located near the disc center ,",
    "the cme mfr eruption is very likely directed toward the earth causing direct space weather impacts . in order to estimate the arrival times of cmes to earth",
    ", a vital step is to understand the kinematic evolution of cmes while propagating through the heliosphere .",
    "based on _ large angle and spectrometric coronagraph _",
    "( lasco ; @xcite ) coronagraph observations on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( soho ) , many studies found that cme having fast speed near the sun , decelerates during its journey to the earth while cme having slow speed accelerates @xcite .",
    "this finding clearly emphasizes the interaction of cme with the ambient solar wind medium .",
    "lasco observes only out to @xmath1 and can provide only projected kinematics of the cme while cme speed changes significantly beyond the fov of coronagraphs . therefore two point measurements of speed , one near the sun and another near the earth , are not sufficient to fully capture the physics of cme evolution in the heliosphere .    in the present era ,",
    "the estimation of cme kinematics from its lift - off in the low corona to the earth or even beyond is possible with multiple views ( a and b ) of the sun - earth space from the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _",
    "( stereo ; @xcite ) . using coronagraphs ( cors ) and heliospheric imagers ( his ) of _ sun - earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation _ ( secchi ; @xcite ) onboard stereo ,",
    "several studies have been carried out attempting to associate remote imaging observations with in situ observations near the earth @xcite .",
    "single and/or multiple spacecraft reconstruction methods on hi observations have shown major limitation in estimating kinematics and the inherent difficulties involved in interpreting the hi observations of the cmes .",
    "however , most of these studies have been carried out mainly for earth - directed cmes during stereo separation was small .",
    "therefore , the tracking of the cme or its associated mfrs moving away form the observer seems to be rarely undertaken for study @xcite .",
    "hence , the assessment of relative performance of reconstruction methods with different geometry , assumed for a cme receding from the observer , is an obvious next step for the solar - terrestrial scientist .    in the present study",
    ", we focused on an eruption event of april 11 , 2013 from the noaa ar 11719 , uniquely involving its gradual build up and eventual eruption to earth directed cme .",
    "the initiation mechanism based on morphological twist signatures of this mfr event was extensively studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vz14 ) .",
    "interestingly , the solar energetic particle ( sep ) event on 11 april , 2013 was found to originate from this eruption event @xcite which produced first large fe - rich sep event of solar cycle 24 @xcite . in view of further sun - earth connection of this cme mfr event ,",
    "in this manuscript , we extended the study of vz14 on the formation or development scenario of mfr in the source ar and its propagation in the inner heliosphere after its eventual eruption from the source ar . utilizing detailed multi - wavelength euv observations from _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ; @xcite ) , we study the evolution history of the source ar prior to three days . in concurrent with the observed morphological evolution , we analyzed vector magnetograms obtained from _ helioseismic and magnetic imager _",
    "( hmi ; @xcite ) to support or revert the scenario of mfr formation by canceling magnetic flux in the source active region . moreover , taking advantage of multi - view observations from stereo / scchi , soho / lasco coronagraphs , we determined orientation of the underlying mfr by a parametrized fitting model to the observed white light cme morphology .",
    "we further tracked this cme , which is moving away from the stereo observer , and estimated its kinematics using stereoscopic and single spacecraft reconstruction methods .",
    "the estimated arrival time of cme mfr at l1 is discussed in comparison with in situ plasma parameters to assess the reliability of the employed tracking methods .",
    "cme kinematics are also derived and discussed using drag based model .",
    "further , the ar twist signatures are explored from in situ magnetic field observations of this cme associated magnetic cloud .",
    "such a study involving multi - scale observations examines the complete sun to earth connection of an event and furthers the understanding in space - weather phenomena .",
    "the manuscript is structured as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , the requirement of observations from various instruments is outlined , and in section  [ sec3]-[sec4 ] , the formidable conditions for the formation / development are explored using coronal euv and photospheric magnetic field observations . for completeness , the details of onset and driving mechanisms of this mfr eruption ( vz14 ) are given in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "the orientation of the mfr while expanding from the source active region is determined in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "its propagation kinematics toward earth and interplanetary twist signatures are presented in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "we concluded with a summarized discussion of this investigation in section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "the overall eruption event of our interest is outlined in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the observations of the source active region noaa 11719 , both at photospheric and low corona heights , are well covered by the solar dynamic observatory and its component instruments aia and hmi .",
    "using aia channels , especially 304 and 94  observations ( 0.6 arcsec / pixel ) , the pre - eruptive ar [ at 06:50ut ] magnetic flux system is noticed to present an inverse - s sigmoidal structure ( top left panel ) that is stacked over filament channels . during the initial upward rise motion at 06:15ut ( just before the main eruption around 06:55ut ) , the plasma emission ( in 131 and 94  observations ) along this sigmoidal structure",
    "supports the interpretation that the sigmoid is manifested by a coherent core twisted flux system surrounded by twisted overlying flux bundle ( vz14 ) .",
    "we regard this coherent core flux along the sigmoid as main body of the mfr , which is wound by the overlying flux bundle .",
    "the time difference image of 193  ( top right panel ) shows an euv disturbance in the low corona during this main phase of eruption .",
    "this euv disturbance also outlines the expanding mfr having legs rooted from the pre - determined ( `` + '' ) sigmoid legs .",
    "the eruption of the sigmoid mfr from the low corona is preceded by a goes m6.5 flare ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "importantly , its cme - driven shock propagates at high altitudes above the solar surface and was likely the source of the solar energetic particles observed near earth @xcite .",
    "this propagating cme in the outer corona was well observed by the _ large angle and spectrometric coronagraph _ ( lasco ; @xcite ) on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) and the secchi on board the stereo ( a and b ) .",
    "the cme structure emerged out of the occulter to become a halo like structure at around 08:30ut .",
    "figure  [ fig1](bottom left ) of lasco / c2 image discerns a bright annular structure on east limb of the disc resembling the leading edge followed by invisible cavity of the mfr .",
    "while expanding , the transit of the mfr through multiple heights , in the field - of - views ( fovs ) of cor1 ( 1.1 - 4@xmath2 ) , cor2 ( 2 - 15@xmath2 ) , lasco / c2 ( 1.5 - 6@xmath2 ) , lasco / c3(3.5 - 30@xmath2 ) situated at perspective viewing angles , uniquely show a direct connection between the heliospheric mfrs and the sigmoidal structures in the source active region ( more details in section  [ sec6 ] ) .",
    "the majority of observed cmes in the past solar cycle had clear mfr structures and no presently known physical mechanism can produce a large - scale fast eruption beyond 10@xmath2 without ejecting a mfr @xcite .",
    "having these supporting observational signatures of mfr topology both in the source region sigmoid and cme morphology , we use the term mfr while describing and interpreting the observations in its favor .",
    "the cme propagation in the heliosphere was tracked by hi - i ( 15 - 90@xmath2 ) and hi - ii ( 70 - 330@xmath2 ) instruments of secchi . in situ plasma and magnetic field observations",
    "are obtained from wind space mission .",
    "taking advantage of these detailed observations , we focus on the objectives mentioned in the last section .",
    ", 335 [ green ] , 193[blue ]  passband observations .",
    "the eastward sigmoid lobe above dark filament is well visible by 10 may , 2013 15:00ut .",
    "the last panel shows the sigmoid morphology while rising upward .",
    "the entire sigmoid is heated due to reconnection in current sheet underneath it . ]",
    "the active region 11719 contains a well observed filament from its appearance on the eastern limb of the solar disc .",
    "the filament consists of two sections which together give an inverse s - shape to it .",
    "these coronal features are identified to be associated with magnetic regions ( labels in figure  [ fig4](a ) ) at the photosphere .",
    "the lower section originates from main sunspot ( s1 ) and has a cusp shape at the joining to upper section .",
    "long coronal loops having footpoints from flux region s2 are well captured in aia passbands , predominantly in 171  and are observed to overly the filament , with conjugate footpoints lying in n1 . in hotter passbands ( 2 - 10mk ) of aia especially in 94 , 131 , the entire active region structure becomes complicated as further features of loops filled with hot plasma are observed .",
    "however , the surrounding structures from other parts of the flux regions have similar thermal conditions .",
    "the field line system around the main filament is not quite enough to reveal the underlying topological configuration in detail . because this entire configuration evolves under quasi - static conditions , we observe no significant large scale structural change for hours .",
    "the aia filter passbands have a wide range of visibility of thermal plasma from chromosphere ( @xmath3 ) to hot , diffused corona ( @xmath4mk ) . in order to disclose details of connection between low lying filament and the overlying loops , we make use of composite images of different combinations prepared from aia passbands . for a simultaneous view of corona from chromosphere , we showed in figure  [ fig1](top left ) , the 304  passband image at 06:50ut on april 11 , 2013 blended with the image of 94  passband at the same time . from this , it is obvious that the low lying filament channel in 304  deviates in projection with the overlying hot sigmoid .",
    "the filament , the sigmoid above it and the overlying flux bundle demonstrate a complex flux systems stacked over each other .",
    "a similar observational view persists well before on 9 april in the 304 , 131 and 171  channels ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the cool filament channel is overlaid by long plasma loops ( ol ) having their photospheric connections on either side of it .",
    "this is analyzed in successive composite frames prepared from 304 , 171 , and 94  ( as shown in 2nd row panels of figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the central part of the filament is increasingly surrounded by hot plasma illuminated in 131 , which indicates the augmenting scenario of the main body of the mfr by wrapped field lines",
    ". this would be likely due to reconnection in the current sheets formed in the interface of mfr and surrounding field , by which the thermal energy heats the plasma to observable temperatures @xcite .",
    "the observations are of three - dimensional structures projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "moreover , although plasma and field are frozen together in highly conducting corona so that coronal plasma structures essentially trace the magnetic field , plasma emission is the only possible distinct observable under certain density and temperature conditions dictated by an observing instrument . in this case , we made use of composite images prepared from different combinations of aia channels ( for quiet and flaring corona with combinations 94 , 335 , 193 ; flaring corona , chromospheres , transition region in combinations of 131 , 94 , 304 ) for our interpretations .",
    "they provide substantial evidence for the developing scenario of the sigmoidal structure during three days of evolution ( images not shown here ) .",
    "the augmentation scenario of the mfr appears to occur in two stages ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) . in the first stage ,",
    "the long overlying loops , ( ol ) in the form of arcade , significantly turn to sheared arcade and then transform toward the east and west lobes of the sigmoid structure . in the second phase , these increasingly inclined loops turn towards two inverse j - sections having footprints lying side by ( l1 and l2 ) the filament . evidently , the loops l1 and l2 reflect a probable involvement in traditional tether - cutting reconnection @xcite .",
    "once reconnection of these l1 and l2 loops occurs , formation of continuous sigmoid is inevitable , by added axial fluxtubes .",
    "these two phases possibly occur in a slow dynamical evolution , where infinitesimal displacements of the flux regions having these loops , induce continuous reconnection , which adds twisted flux threads wounding some common axis of the existing mfr .",
    "this mechanism therefore is identical to the sheared arcade to rope transformation proposed by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the observed magnetic flux distribution well supports this augmentation scenario which shows the canceling and approaching opposite flux patches side by the filament ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "our interpretations are further supported by another set of observations ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) below .    earlier on 9 april ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , the existence of the sigmoidal structure is not clear in hot channels except faintly observed filament channel .",
    "however , emission from the lower lobe section ( like inverse j ) is conspicuously present most of the time . after a day of evolution i.e.",
    ", by april 10 , a developing sigmodal structure becomes apparent with a well visible east lobe .",
    "specifically , the hot overlying flux bundle at the middle of the sigmoid and its geometric evolution is of interest ( vz14 ) .",
    "while undergoing dynamical evolution , this whole structure brightens intermittently , probably corresponding to small scale reconnections of the loop systems .",
    "one such major bright emission corresponds to a partial / failed eruption ( around 18:00ut on april 10 ) in which the mfr lifted and appears to split so that the upper part expels and lower section settled back to its stable position @xcite .",
    "data gaps around this period constrain to reveal more details on this partial eruption . after this , the two j - shaped sections merged to form a continuous sigmoidal mfr which is very apparent ( panels at 15:00/10 , 01:00/11 april ) , by this time the magnetic flux distribution shows fragmented and disappearing positive flux corresponding to the northern lobe structure of the mfr .",
    "further , during the evolution of three days , it is difficult to interpret the magnetic topology of this flux system of filament / sigmoid from the projected imaging information .",
    "bald patch seperatrix surface ( bpss ) and hyperbolic flux tube ( hft ) are two kinds of topological configurations associated with theoretically predicted mfr models @xcite . as suggested by van ballagooijen",
    ", sigmoids formed from sheared arcades by photospheric flux cancellation driven by converging motions , which is the case here , are more likely associated with bpss rather than hft .",
    "when the sigmoid structure is regarded as mfr lying low in height , its middle section dips into dense photosphere and appears as two j - sections in the coronal observations like x - ray or euv .",
    "however , the associated bpss topology may turn to hft while slow upward rise motion commences @xcite and continuous structure of mfr will be envisioned .",
    "because fast reconnection occurs in a thinning current sheet with hft , the mfr lifts off the filament completely with full eruption and is very unlikely for the eruption to be suppressed at that stage .",
    ".net magnetic flux from the contour region in figure  [ fig4 ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     for ssse methods , the quoted speed is transit value    direction with negative ( positive ) sign refers to cme propagation in eastward ( westward ) to the sun - earth line .",
    "first cor2 appearance of leading edge is taken as launch time for ssse methods    negative ( positive ) value of error in arrival time refers earlier ( late ) arrival of the cme    [ tab3 ]    we noted that the hmf and ssef methods estimate the propagation speed of the cme apex , which is not exactly towards the earth , therefore we have applied geometrical correction @xcite to estimate its speed in an off - apex direction .",
    "this geometrically corrected speed , which is less than its speed derived in the apex direction , is used to obtain the estimated arrival time of the cme at l1 point .    from table",
    "[ tab3 ]  it is obvious that , among all the single spacecraft reconstruction methods , the most accurate estimation of cme arrival time ( within an error of 3 - 8 hr ) is obtained by the fpf method and less accurate by the hmf method .",
    "however , if we believe the direction of propagation of cme estimated from gcs model as accurate , then estimation of the direction from fpf methods is erroneous in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we find that even the fitting methods overestimate the speed of the cme . in principle",
    ", these fitting methods always overestimate the speed of fast cme as they estimate a constant speed for cme and therefore they are unable to incorporate the real deceleration due to acting drag forces on the cme .",
    "this limitation of these methods is most obvious for cme propagating largely away from the sun - spacecraft line .",
    "if we bear the uncertainties with the direction of propagation of the cmes , then fpf method does a good job for predicting arrival time of cme at l1 .",
    "we infer that in the fpf method , the two sources of errors arising from not taking the geometry of the cme and physical deceleration into account actually cancels each other .",
    "however , any such physical deceleration is significantly counted in terms of geometrical ( i.e. apparent ) deceleration , if ssef and hmf methods are used .",
    "the analysis of this event could help us to realize the potential differences in the results because of different fitting methods .",
    "( indicated for each curve ) as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "cme take off position @xmath6 and speed @xmath7 are considered from gcs kinematics .",
    "intersecting point of the each curve on the horizontal ( dotted ) line gives @xmath5 value for the cme arrival at l1 .",
    "* bottom : * cme trajectories ( @xmath8 ) as a function of time for ambient solar wind velocity w=350 , 375 , 400 km / s .",
    "velocity ( @xmath9 ) is also plotted with y - axis scale on the right .",
    "dotted lines points the in - situ mc arrival time ( april 14 , 2013 at 17:35ut ) on the trajectories .",
    "note that the arrival times are differed by 5h for the range @xmath10 . ]      despite using the ssse method with @xmath11 equal to @xmath12 , a rise in the cme speed around 14:00 ut on 2013 april 12 at a distance of @xmath13 is noticed .",
    "this late increase is unphysical , for the reasons mentioned earlier and also due to the limitations of the ssse method described in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the average in situ measured speed of the cme is around 450 km / s whereas each method ( even single spacecraft based ) applied in our study overestimates the speed of the tracked feature of the cme and is why these methods estimate the arrival well before the in - situ arrival .",
    "therefore , beyond a certain radial distance from the sun over which the cme is expected to maintain its deceleration , we have applied the drag based model ( dbm ; @xcite ) to estimate the arrival time and speed of the cme at l1 .",
    "the model is based on the hypothesis that beyond a certain distance the cme dynamics becomes governed solely by the interaction of the cme and the ambient solar wind via aerodynamic drag @xcite .",
    "this assumption relies on the fact that in the interplanetary space fast cmes decelerate , and slow ones accelerate , showing a tendency to have their velocity trend towards that of the ambient solar wind .",
    "cmes fulfill this assumption generally at heliocentric distances around or beyond @xmath14 @xcite . in the dbm model ,",
    "the solution ( position @xmath8 and velocity @xmath9 ) to the equation of motion describing the dynamics of the cmes under the assumption of constant solar wind speed ( @xmath15 ) and drag parameter ( @xmath5 ) is given by @xcite .",

    "based on earlier works @xcite , we assume that the mfr corresponds to the magnetic cloud in in situ observations and therefore , it is logical to compare the actual arrival of the magnetic cloud ( here april 14 , 17:35ut ) with that deduced from the propagation of the mfr in cor images . as @xmath15 and @xmath5",
    "are unknown under which conditions the cme is propagating ( see equation  3 ) , using the gcs kinematics as input to dbm , we performed a parametric analysis to obtain their approximate constrained values .    from the gcs",
    "fitting shown in table  [ tab2 ] , we constructed radial distance profile by including more points .",
    "we fit that profile to a second order polynomial and then derived the velocity profile by invoking a smooth cubic spline interpolation procedure .",
    "this results in an expected deceleration of the cme in its outward propagation from @xmath19 onward . from the heliocentric distance of @xmath20 at the time",
    "instance 10:54ut , we find that the cme is moving at a speed of @xmath21 .",
    "we assume from this distance onwards that the further cme propagation has no influence of lorentz force and has not deflected because of interaction with another cme .    supplying @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( obtained from gcs fit ) to equation  3 , we calculated the time difference between calculated ( c ) and observed (o: in - situ ) arrival time of cme at @xmath24 , by varying @xmath5 at a range of w values . this time difference ( o - c ) as a function of @xmath5 is plotted in figure  [ fig15](top ) .",
    "note that the curves for fast ( @xmath25 ) and slow ( @xmath26 ) solar wind speed intersect the zero time difference line at @xmath5 values which are unsuitable for this medium mass cme @xcite and therefore the values for @xmath5 should lie for the curves @xmath27 .",
    "statistical studies have shown that while implementing dbm , the choice of @xmath5 has lesser effect than ambient solar wind speed in determining the arrival time and transit speed of cmes at 1au @xcite .",
    "so , assuming a constant value for @xmath5 ( @xmath28 which is the intercept for the curve at @xmath29 ) within this range of solar wind , we plotted in figure  [ fig15](bottom ) the cme trajectory ( equations 3 and 4 ) for its initial take off position and speed obtained from gcs fit .",
    "as can be noted from this plot , the arrival times are differed only by 5hrs about the mean value curve of @xmath29 . also , the transit velocities vary from mean value 428km / s by only 24km / s .",
    "this parametric analysis constructs the cme kinematics reasonably well , once we admit significant uncertainties in the cme takeoff position and speed .",

    "when a cme reaches earth , the magnetic field strength associated with the mc is stronger than the ambient field .",

    "we plotted , in figure  [ fig16 ] , the observations of magnetic field components by wind instrument situated near lagrange point of earth .",

    "when mc passes , the magnetic field components show systematic variation indicating strong magnetic field associated to mfr .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath30 components remain positive , while @xmath32 component changes sign from positive to negative around the mid time ( around 07:00ut on april 15 ) of the mc passage . based on this information and the nature of the twist in the source ar",
    ", we interpreted the possible orientation of the mfr upto l1 @xcite .    in figure  [ fig17 ] , we schematically sketched the sun - earth connections by mfr in xz plane of the gse system . in this figure ,",
    "axis of the mfr is approximately in meridian plane whereas the mfr is having around @xmath33 tilt angle in the source ar .",
    "we point that there is now substantial observational evidence for the rotation of mfrs during their dynamic evolution and propagation @xcite .",
    "our schematic , however , is motivated by the observations of mfr rotation by about @xmath34 depending on its magnetic chirality @xcite . in our case , although the tilt can be upto @xmath35 in cor fov , it can even smoothly vary upto @xmath36 tending toward the meridian plane . in a majority of cases (  64% )",
    ", cmes in cor fov do have their orientation angles differed within @xmath37 with their interplanetary counterparts @xcite .",
    "the axial field is northward directed ( ecliptic north ) contributing to the @xmath30 component , which is positive . in this predicted orientation , the mfr cuts the xy plane in a circle having azimuthal field information and magnetic helicity ( handedness ) signatures of the mc .",
    "when mc passes , different regions of this cross - section encounter the spacecraft at different time phases ( say t1 , t2 , t3 sequentially , here t2 is 07:00ut on april 15 ) .",
    "the projection of the azimuthal field on y - axis at those time instances explains the sign and magnitude of the observed @xmath32 component .",
    "we can suitably fix the spacecraft position on the y - axis depending on the observed sign of @xmath31 component , which is positive here .",
    "obviously , the handedness of this azimuthal field should be negative ( left ) in order to match the observed @xmath32-component variation from positive to negative , which is consistent with the source ar signatures of inverse s - sigmoidal structure and the negative value of @xmath38 .",
    "this event is similar to the one observed on 2000 , february 21 @xcite with right hand twist , where the @xmath32 component of mc changes sign from negative to positive value .",

    "the morphological study of its evolution during 48 hour period implies a scenario of augmenting mfr .",
    "this augmentation evidently found to occur by reconnection of inclined loops lying side by the filament . under the slow flux motions , both the transformation of distance overlying loops toward sheared arcade ( stage 1 ) , and their reconnection ( stage 2 ) at the middle of the sigmoid are the suggested scenarios involved in the development of this sigmoidal mfr .",
    "the hmi magnetic fields measurements in the source ar support the euv observations , showing monotonic decreasing net flux for the last two days . the net flux from the rope leg and the entire ar ,",
    "according to mfr insertion models @xcite , implies a marginal stability of the system of axial flux confined by the overlying polaidal flux .",
    "the average twist of the flux system in the ar also suggests a rapid build up of the mfr structure past 7 hours to the onset of the eruption .",
    "it also suggests the availability of critical twist ( vz14 ) in order to initiate rise motion of the mfr .",
    "therefore , this study of euv and magnetic fields suggests that the developed mfr system is initiated to upward motion by kink - instability to reach to a height ( 31 mm ) from where steep gradients of horizontal field ( torus - instability criteria , @xcite drives its further outward motion in the outer corona .",
    "while expanding in the extended corona ( after 07:10ut , 2 - 30@xmath2 ) , the cme morphology captured from cor1 , cor2 , and lasco views , visually fits with a parametrized mfr orientation , which aligns with the orientation of magnetic neutral line in the source active region .",
    "tilt angle is a crucial parameter in determining orientation of mfr",
    ". mfrs by virtue of inherent twist , are shown to rotate upto @xmath39 while propagating ( 2 - 4@xmath2 ) in the low corona @xcite .",
    "this backsided halo cme did not allow us to detect the exact extent of possible mfr rotation .",
    "however , a tilt angle of @xmath33 projects the mfr on to the plane of sky to sufficiently map the white light features of this halo cme event . an unchanged value of aspect ratio ( ratio of minor to major radius of mfr=0.45 ) at successive stages of this cme mfr indicates its self - similar nature of expansion .",
    "tracking methods found that the cme is propagating about @xmath40 to the east of the sun - earth line .",
    "this is consistent with the solar source location of the cme and the estimated direction in cor fov from the gcs model .",
    "although source ar magnetic configuration defines the mfr orientation , due to bulk in size combined with projection effects , the exact orientation of mfr in the interplanetary space is difficult to predict within @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the predicted mfr orientation ( mfr axis is in a vertical plane to ecliptic , see figure  [ fig17 ] ) identifies the source ar twist signatures , which is left handed , in the in situ magnetic field observations of mc .",
    "this predicted orientation based on in situ observations , if correct , alternatively suggests a possible rotation ( clockwise as seen in line - of - sight direction , to align with meridian plane ) of mfr apex upto @xmath34 while traveling from sun to the near - earth environment .",
    "it is worth pointing that the @xmath30 component of this mc is northward , consequently no geomagnetic activity was associated with this cme .",
    "our analysis underlines the overestimation of the speed from all the stereoscopic methods applied on 2013 april 11 cme .",
    "therefore , for the selected cme , when the stereo is behind the sun , tracking of cme shock , leading edge , and flux ropes and predicting their arrival time at 1 au is challenging . further , for the position of stereo between february 2011 and 2019 june , any earth - directed cme will be moving away from the stereo space craft and hence , the estimation of kinematics and arrival time of cme during this time is expected to result in large errors .",
    "stereoscopic reconstruction methods lead to worse results than single spacecraft reconstruction methods .",
    "we note that fixed - phi fitting method seems to perform best among all the reconstruction methods used in our study . as the physical deceleration of the cme",
    "is translated as geometrical deceleration in fitting methods , the ssef and the hmf method seems to work poorer than the fpf method , for this quickly decelerating cme . based on our analysis limited to a single event",
    ", we suggest that the use of fpf method should be done for practical purpose of arrival time prediction of such a cme .",
    "however , in the absence of fitting methods , we must use the reconstruction methods ( i.e. tas and hm ) which approximates the cme as a very wide structure ( i.e. higher value of @xmath11 ) for estimating the kinematics and arrival time of cme moving at higher angle from sun - spacecraft line .    as almost all applied reconstruction methods failed to estimate accurate arrival time , alternatively",
    ", our study suggests that the estimated kinematics by the implementation of gcs model on cor2 observations can preferably be used as inputs in the dbm @xcite to reconstruct the cme trajectory and thereby estimate the arrival time . by a combination of parametric study and the observations ,",
    "the unknown parameters like solar wind speed and drag parameter can be constrained suitably to match the in - situ arrival .",
