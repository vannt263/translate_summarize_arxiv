    "bec of excitons in semiconductors has been a subject of intense interest for decades . in semiconductors , an electron in conduction band and a hole in valence band can bind together by coulomb interaction to form an exciton , a composite boson in contrast to electrons in superconductors , which bind together to form cooper pairs.@xcite while bec and superconductivity were found in superconductors , excitons in semiconductors have the potential to reach bec , novel collective ground states or even superfluidity .",

    "the results suggest the formation of stable excitons by showing exciton s @xmath17 internal transitions;@xcite on the other hand , they were interpreted as the hybridization gap due to a mixing of the electron and hole wavefunctions.@xcite though most of the fir investigation reveal multiple modes around cr in inas / gasb cqws , only a single mode was observed up to @xmath18 and interpreted as electron - cr by heitmann _ et al_.@xcite earlier studies in inas / gasb superlattice systems show electron cr , intersubband transitions and sometimes two absorptions near cr attributed to two occupied electron subbands.@xcite more recent reports about the inas / gasb 2dehs demonstrate results in favor of the hybridization gap interpretation.@xcite the hybridization model in association with the @xmath19 model can account for several features observed in this type of material , including the magnetic - field dependence of the cr energies,@xcite oscillation in cr linewidth , mass , and amplitude,@xcite the influence of a parallel magnetic field,@xcite the slow decay rate of the temperature - dependent absorption intensity,@xcite and the anomalies observed in magneto - transport measurements.@xcite    in inas / gasb cqw systems , the overlap between the electron and hole subbands can be reduced or even completely eliminated by the confinement energy ( small well width and high magnetic field ) ; therefore minimizing the effect of the hybridization .",
    "it has been shown that the degree of hybridization can be modified by the width of inas and gasb well , or by inserting a spacer layer.@xcite increasing inas or gasb well width tends to enhance the degree of hybridization by increasing the mixing of the electron and hole landau levels , whereas the interposed barrier layer tends to reduce it . with a barrier layer as thin as @xmath20-@xmath21 atomic layers , the mixing of the electron and hole wavefunctions can be suppressed,@xcite since the penetration length should be of the order of @xmath22 in this system.@xcite although the electron - hole coulomb interaction decreases with increasing average distance between 2des and 2dhs as the barrier layer is inserted , such a thin barrier layer has a negligible effect on the interlayer coulomb interactions.@xcite generally , multiple absorption modes near cr were found in systems , which have configurations in favor of hybridization model in contrast to a single absorption mode , attributed to electron cr , which was observed in the weakly hybridized systems.@xcite    in this paper , we present the result of the fir magneto - optical study on weakly hybridized inas / alsb / gasb cqws , which have narrow well width and a @xmath22 alsb barrier layer separating electron and hole layers .",
    "this particular configuration has been shown theoretically to have negligible hybridization coupling , but sufficient interlayer coulomb coupling , proposed as a candidate for achieving a stable condensed phase of excitons.@xcite we have observed a pair of fir absorptions occurring only at magnetic fields higher than @xmath3 with a field - independent ( piecewise ) energy separation .",
    "this pair of modes does not decay with increasing temperature up to @xmath2 and is insensitive to increasing parallel magnetic fields .",
    "these features distinguish our results from the ones reported in the literature .",
    "the connection between these phenomena and several models known to cause multiple absorption modes near cr is discussed .",
    "none of the models can account for the key features observed in this work , which suggests that more investigations should be carried out for this exciton system .",

    "the electron density is around @xmath26 and the hole density is around @xmath27 determined by the transport measurement@xcite for the particular sample shown in this paper .",
    "the electron and hole densities can be determined separately from the sdh oscillations .",
    "this implies a very weak hybridization effect between the 2des and 2dhs states .",
    "samples whose electron densities ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 and hole densities ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath30 have been investigated .",
    "the carrier densities are controlled by the thickness of the gasb cap layer and determined from the transport measurements fitted by two carrier conduction model.@xcite the detail configuration of the heterostructure and its corresponding carrier densities can be found in ref . [ 65 ] .",

    "below @xmath33 , only a single absorption mode is observed , attributed to the electron cr in the inas qw , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1 . from the cr energies at low magnetic fields ,",
    "the effective mass is determined to be @xmath34 , consistent with the values reported in the literature , but much larger than the bulk electron mass @xmath35 .",
    "the observed absorption modes below and above the gaas restrahlen band exhibits an oscillation in cr amplitude , linewidth and masses , which is similar to the one reported in the literature.@xcite all of these spectra are dark , which were taken without the beforehand light emitting diode ( led ) illumination . unlike some reported results,@xcite beforehand led illumination",
    "does not induce new modes , nor does it change the cr energy or absorption intensity .",
    "several works reported the observation of the hole cr in the gasb layer and the hole effective mass was determined to be around @xmath36 to @xmath37.@xcite no signs of hole cr have been observed beyond the noise level in any of the samples investigated , though high magnetic fields used in these measurements can place the hole cr in the observable frequency range in our setups .",
    "this result is similar to the general behavior of the reported multiple absorption modes .",
    "a pair of modes ( in some reports , more than two modes ) , separated by a few m@xmath11 , occurs near cr energy and their relative strength evolves with an increasing magnetic field . in this work ,",
    "the lower - energy transition ( crl ) is the strongest of the two at @xmath3 . with increasing magnetic field",
    ", the higher - energy transition ( crh ) increases in intensity at the expense of  crl .",
    "this process is reversed at around @xmath38 , above which crl increases in intensity at the expense of crh .",
    "the process is then reversed again at around @xmath39 and crh remains the dominating transition up to @xmath0 , which is the highest field measured for this series of samples .",
    "the evolution of the relative intensity is more similar to previous works , which interpreted the pair of modes in terms of cr and exciton s internal transitions;@xcite while others , which interpreted the multiple absorption modes in terms of hybridization of electron and hole wavefunctions , reported an evolution that a new mode appears from the lower - energy side , and replaces those that tail off to the higher - energy region.@xcite    although this pair of modes exhibit features similar to the ones reported in the literature , several key differences are difficult to explain by the previous models , hybridization of the electron - hole wavefunctions or exciton s internal transitions .",
    "these key differences will be discussed in the following subsections .",
    "one may notice that we prefer to refer the pair of modes found in this work as `` cr splitting '' , in place of the term , `` multiple absorption modes near cr '' , since we believe that they are both a consequence of electron cr involved with a transition between two electron landau levels .",
    "( lls ) in the hybridization model , the absorption modes arose from transitions between two electron - like lls and between a hole - like and an electron - like ll ; while in the exciton model , one of the modes is due to the electron cr and the other , from the @xmath17 internal transitions of an exciton .",
    "for those transitions , we will refer to them as multiple absorption modes near cr , though we will also use this term to describe our findings occasionally , since it is a more general term .",
    "in addition , we will also refer to the two models in abbreviated terms as `` exciton model '' and `` hybridization model '' .",
    "it has been argued that hybridization model , or conduction - valence landau level ( ll ) mixing , has an insignificant effect at high and low fields,@xcite while the cr splitting in this paper occur only at magnetic fields higher than @xmath3 . in the literature ,",
    "multiple absorptions were observed throughout and within nearly entire magnetic range investigated.@xcite one may argue that the magnetic field range , where the cr splitting were observed in this paper , is in fact the `` intermediate '' field range , but it is very unlikely .",
    "it is essentially impossible to place an intermediate regime within the confine of the given system .",
    "the hybridization model is about an antilevel crossing gap which occurs due to a resonance between electron and hole wavefunctions .",
    "it occurs at a magnetic field when the electron or hole lls are aligned ; in other words , at the points where the electron and hole lls cross each other .",
    "using electron mass @xmath40 , hole mass @xmath41 and electron density as @xmath26 , an energy diagram for the landau levels in this system is established in fig .",
    "3 . near the crossing points , a transition between a hole - like to an electron - like ll becomes possible due the mixing of the electron and hole ll wavefunctions . as a result ,",
    "more absorption modes make their appearance other than the transitions via two electron lls . for the exciton model",
    ", the binding of electrons and holes requires the energy separation between them to be lower than the binding energy .",
    "we can expect anomalies as a result of electron - hole binding around these crossing points as well , though there should be a sizable excitonic binding energy before the alignment of the electron and hole lls.@xcite    by selecting a small effective band gap @xmath42 ( @xmath43)@xcite , it can be clearly seen that any anomalies , due to either models , will not result in multiple absorption modes at low magnetic fields , since these anomalies are deep in the fermi sea and the neighboring lls are occupied .",
    "this explains why no cr splitting was observed at low magnetic fields in our samples or in the ones reported by heitmann _",
    "et al_.@xcite the electron densities in both cases are generally larger than the ones used in other reports , resulting in a larger fermi energy @xmath44 as compared to @xmath45 .    at intermediate magnetic fields , anomalies near the crossing point",
    "( @xmath46 can result in multiple absorptions through ll transitions between the @xmath47 and @xmath48 electron - like lls , and from the hole - like lls to the @xmath48 electron - like lls , possibly responsible for the two broad modes observed between @xmath3 to @xmath49 .",
    "however , cr splitting at higher magnetic fields can not be a result of electron - hole ll mixing , since electron lls will no longer be aligned to the hole lls at higher magnetic fields .",
    "this picture may explain why there exist two distinct regimes for cr splitting . in the intermediate magnetic field regime ( @xmath3 to @xmath49 ) ,",
    "absorption modes are broad and weak with a larger energy separation , in which the hybridization may have an effect on these modes ; while in the high magnetic field regime ( @xmath50 ) , absorption modes are sharp and strong with a smaller energy separation , in which hybridization has negligible effect .",
    "indeed , electron - hole ll mixing can occur at higher magnetic fields if the hole levels are located at higher energies .",
    "( i.e. larger @xmath51 ) a negative energy gap as large as @xmath52m@xmath11 has been used to account for the multiple absorptions observed at high magnetic fields.@xcite even by shifting the hole lls up by less than @xmath53m@xmath11 , where the ll mixing can barely result in multiple absorptions at around @xmath54 , ll mixing will also result in additional absorption at around @xmath55 through ll transitions between @xmath48 and @xmath56 lls , which were not observed in this series of samples .",
    "the position of the fermi surface ( fs ) can place the minigap deep in the fermi sea , and naturally minimize the influence of the hybridization even if the sample is strongly hybridized .",
    "in fact , most of the reports in favor of the hybridization model have placed the fs between electron and hole subbands , i.e. within the energy gap , which will definitely result in multiple modes at very low magnetic fields.@xcite    another explanation for the lack of cr splitting at lower magnetic fields is that the interposed barrier layer suppresses the strength of the hybridization . no matter whether the fs is above the hole subbands or between the electron and hole subbands , hybridization in these samples is too weak to result in multiple modes even when the electron and hole lls are aligned .",
    "the latter appears to be a more viable explanation , since most of the band calculations place the fs within the energy gap .",
    "the energy separation between the absorption modes appeared to be field - independent when it was plotted over a wide range in previous reports .",
    "multiple absorption modes were obtained from a set of spin - split lls in the hybridization model .",
    "although the magnetic - field induced spin splitting may not be as significant as the antilevel crossing gap , the separation still carries a zeeman term which grows with increasing magnetic field.@xcite upon taking a closer look at the data in the literature , the separation between the modes is indeed increasing with increasing magnetic field defined piecewise between the crossing points of the electron and hole lls.@xcite since the region between two crossings expands with increasing magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , a magnetic - field dependent separation will be more pronounced at high magnetic fields .    to demonstrate that the separation between the cr splitting , crl and crh , is field - independent",
    "more precisely , the spectra were offset horizontally to align crl at @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "4 and the energies of the modes as a function of magnetic field are plotted in the bottom .",
    "in fact , there exist three zones with three distinct separation energies . in general , the energies of crl and crh increase linearly with increasing magnetic field .",
    "two abrupt drops in each trace divide the region , where the cr splitting have been observed , into a succession of three zones , labeled : zones ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , respectively .  at the lower end of this region ( zone 1 ) , the separation energy is about @xmath58 before crl makes an abrupt drop .",
    "the energy separation is then about @xmath59 ( zone 2 ) until crh also makes an abrupt drop in energy . above @xmath57",
    ", the separation is maintained at around @xmath60 ( zone 3 ) as long as two modes are still observed up to @xmath61 .",
    "these values are of the same magnitude as compared to the exciton binding energies calculated by various works , but none have suggested a field - dependent binding energy with discontinuities .",
    "the discontinuities in mode energies have been observed in several works.@xcite these two abrupt drops in energy may be regarded as a part of the cr effective mass oscillation , and it will be discussed in section e.    in zones ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the energy separations between crl and crh are generally larger than the separation in zone ( 3 ) , which is inconsistent with the concept that the cr splitting are a result of a pair of lls with different spin states . moreover , within zones ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the energy separation is again slightly larger at lower fields , inconsistent with the nature of the zeeman splitting . in zone",
    "( 3 ) , the energy separation maintains a nearly perfect field - independent energy separation up to @xmath61 . at high magnetic fields ,",
    "the influence of the spin splitting should be discernibly visible .",
    "the lack of a magnetic - field dependent energy separation in this work suggests that the cr splitting is not a consequence of a set of spin - split lls , and is thus unlikely to result from the hybridization of the electron and hole wavefunctions .",
    "we here acknowledge that works in favor of the exciton model have reported an energy separation , which was also slightly larger at lower magnetic fields.@xcite      previous studies in these types of materials have revealed that multiple absorptions will merge into one if the temperature is sufficiently high.@xcite in the exciton model , the higher - energy transition was interpreted as an exciton internal transition , while the thermal energy , overcoming the binding energy , breaks the bond between the electron and hole in the exciton.@xcite marlow _",
    "et al . _ then argued that the higher - energy transition did not decay fast enough for an exciton with a binding energy about @xmath62 ; therefore , the decay of the higher - energy transition is a result of populating the higher - energy spin - split lls with increasing temperature@xcite and interpreted it in terms of the hybridization model .",
    "et al . _ then observed that multiple modes merged into one at around @xmath63 , while the sum of the absorption intensity increases with increasing temperature.@xcite the increase in the integrated intensity has been interpreted to mean that the thermal excitations give access to transitions associated with levels away from the minigap with lower degree of hybridization.@xcite in spite of how the temperature dependence was interpreted in the past , multiple modes converge at high temperatures and usually merged into one at even higher temperatures beyond the critical point of modal convergence .    a set of spectra measured at @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 for three different temperatures",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "5 to demonstrate the temperature dependence of the cr splitting .",
    "one can instantly see that the absorption modes are insensitive to increasing temperature .",
    "these modes are rather robust against rising thermal excitations , which suggests that both modes result from free - carrier excitations with the fs far away from the minigap , consistent with the picture illustrated in sec .",
    "a.    as indicated in sec .",
    "a , the minigap , if existed , is deep in the fermi sea and the states around minigaps are occupied .",
    "since the fs is pinned at the corresponding electron lls with a ll separation around several hundred @xmath67 , thermal excitation at @xmath63 can hardly distort the fs at high magnetic fields .",
    "though it is possible that the minigap lies closer to the fs at intermediate fields ( @xmath68-@xmath49 ) , the spectra at these fields are not displayed due to the reduced signal - to - noise ratio at higher temperatures .",
    "the broad peaks observed at intermediate fields are close to the noise level , but the results are more likely to be temperature - independent .",
    "the nature of the hybridization model is an antilevel crossing gap as a result of pauli exclusion principle , creating minigaps near the resonances of electron and hole ll wavefunctions .",
    "a parallel magnetic field can cause a phase shift between electrons and holes , moving the electron and hole dispersion relations in opposite directions in @xmath69-space.@xcite this shift decouples the dispersion relations and eliminates the formation of the minigap .",
    "this phenomenon was experimentally confirmed in the inas / gasb cqws,@xcite and was considered as plausible evidence in support of the formation of minigaps in these types of materials .",
    "similar to what happened to the absorption modes when the temperature is increased , multiple absorption modes merge into one with increasing parallel magnetic field;@xcite while petchsingh _",
    "et al . _ reported an increase of the integrated intensity occurred simultaneously@xcite not unlike the one discussed in the previous section .",
    "a parallel magnetic field as small as @xmath55 suppresses the hybridization and destroys the formation of the minigaps even in the strongly hybridized samples.@xcite    the sample is placed on a wedge with the normal direction of the sample tilted at an angle from the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the tilt angle was determined to be @xmath70 by fitting the cr energies at low magnetic fields .",
    "a set of magneto - fir spectra measured in the tilted geometry is displayed in fig .",
    "6 and the energies of the crl and crh modes as a function of the total magnetic field are displayed in the bottom .",
    "the magnitudes of the parallel ( @xmath71 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath72 ) fields are shown in the bracket and a parallel magnetic field as large as @xmath49 has been reached .",
    "the spectra were divided into two groups ; the spectra with a perpendicular field larger than @xmath54 are displayed in the top graph while the ones below @xmath54 are displayed in the bottom .",
    "twenty tesla was the magnitude of the magnetic field which divided the cr splitting into a sharp - peak region and a broad - peak region in the faraday geometry .",
    "as compared to the spectra measured in the faraday geometry , the absorption modes become sharp and strong at around the same total magnetic field , instead of the same perpendicular field , suggesting that the sharp - peak behavior , or the narrowing of the linewidth , are induced by the total field , independent of the tilt angles .",
    "however , the abrupt drops of mode energies occur at around the same perpendicular fields ; in other words , they occur at the same filling factors or the same ll separations .",
    "the cr splitting are observed at a parallel magnetic field higher than @xmath33 , while it was shown to be sufficient to suppress the formation of the minigaps in strongly hybridized samples.@xcite by comparing the spectra of similar perpendicular fields , but different parallel fields , crh in comparison to crl becomes slightly stronger , which can simply be a result that their relative strength are mainly determined by the total field , instead of the perpendicular field .",
    "the energies of crl and crh generally scale with tilting angle @xmath73 as @xmath74 with an additional suppression at high fields , possibly due to the additional confinement introduced by the high parallel fields .",
    "additional confinement reduces the effective well width , thus resulting in a larger effective mass ; in other words , a lower cr energy . the energy separation is about @xmath75 in zone ( 1 ) , @xmath76 in zone ( 2 ) and @xmath77 in zone ( 3 ) .",
    "the first two are slightly smaller than their counterparts in the faraday geometry , while the last one is slightly larger than its counterpart .",
    "the energy separation is slightly smaller at intermediate magnetic fields , which may be due to the closing of the minigaps by increasing parallel magnetic field ; however , it also demonstrates that the effect of the hybridization is secondary to the major factor causing the cr splitting . at high magnetic fields ,",
    "the separation becomes larger , which can not be explained by the hybridization model , or the concept of spin - split electron cr .    in the tilted geometry , parallel magnetic field",
    "can also cause the lls of different electron subbands to couple , known as resonant subband ll coupling.@xcite a quick estimate places the electron s 2nd subband @xmath78m@xmath11 above the first , which is too high to produce an effect in measurements below @xmath0 .",
    "the oscillation of cr was found to be more pronounced in the inas - based 2ds@xcite than the one in the gaas - based systems.@xcite on one hand , cr linewidth maxima were observed at even filling factor @xmath79 s and the minima at odd @xmath79s,@xcite attributed to the @xmath79-dependent screening of impurity scattering by the 2d electron gas.@xcite on the contrary , linewidth maxima were observed for odd @xmath79 s in the spin - resolved cr measurements,@xcite attributed to the nonparabolicity effect.@xcite the driving mechanism behind such a pronounced cr oscillation particularly in the inas - based 2ds is not fully understood ; nonetheless , cr oscillation can still be used to reveal principal parameters , such as carrier densities , which in this case , help to determine which mode , crl or crh , is more likely to result from the typical electron cr .",
    "unlike the multiple absorption modes reported in the literature , the observed cr splitting is insensitive to increasing temperature or parallel magnetic fields . as a result",
    ", both of them can be a conventional electron cr .",
    "to understand the origin of the cr splitting , it is very important to identify which one results from the typical electron cr .",
    "an electron - hole coupling is likely to have an attractive interaction , which tends to result in an absorption at higher energies as more energy is needed to break the coupling ; while an electron - electron coupling is likely to have a repulsive interaction , leading to an absorption mode at lower energies .",
    "the oscillations of cr effective mass , amplitude and linewidth ( half width at half maximum ) are displayed in fig .",
    "7 and the period of the oscillation agrees well with the electron density of @xmath80 with linewidth maxima for even - valued filling factor @xmath79 s . by using the cr effective mass oscillation",
    "observed at lower magnetic fields , where only a single absorption has been observed , one can extend the oscillations to higher magnetic fields to determine which one is more likely to be electron cr .",
    "crl has an oscillation pattern consistent with the ones found at low magnetic fields ; therefore , we intend to believe that crl results from the typical electron cr in the inas layer , while crh is an induced mode .",
    "since it has produced an additional absorption mode at a higher energy , an attractive interaction is more likely to be the cause .",
    "electron - hole interaction is a likely cause , while the hybridization model results from an antilevel crossing , which comes from the repulsive interactions between the states . in the works supporting the hybridization model ,",
    "a new mode emerges from the lower energy side,@xcite which illustrates that the interaction is repulsive .",
    "the crl s effective mass oscillates with filling factors and a sudden rise in effective mass occurs at around @xmath81 , corresponding to the abrupt drop in crl energy in fig .",
    "4 ; then , it is possibly approaching another effective mass maximum near @xmath82 .",
    "the sudden rise in effective mass may be related to the unique properties of the @xmath83 quantum hall states , which has been a subject of interest recently.@xcite though the region where the crh mode has been observed is not wide enough to exhibit significant periodic behavior , a similar effective mass jump has been observed at around @xmath84 , corresponding to the abrupt drop in crh energy .",
    "it has been shown that both of these jumps are either filling factor or perpendicular field dependent in sec .",
    "d. one can hardly correlate @xmath85 and @xmath83 to one another and to a common physical origin .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the effective mass jump of crh mode also occurs at around @xmath83 , but from a region of slightly higher carrier density .",
    "the implication of this concept will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv c.    the amplitude oscillation at high magnetic fields , i.e. lower filling factors , is more driven by the exchange of the integrated intensity between the cr splitting , instead of the @xmath79-dependent oscillations .",
    "crl s amplitude decreases while crh s increases between @xmath86 , then the process is reversed between @xmath87 . both amplitudes increase with increasing magnetic field between @xmath88 , corresponding to an anomalous linewidth narrowing at @xmath84 .",
    "( transition from the broad - peak to the sharp - peak regions ) in the end , crh s amplitude continues to increase for @xmath89 , while crl s amplitude decreases with increasing magnetic fields .",
    "the evolution of the cr amplitudes with increasing magnetic fields tends to mimic the evolutionary profile of the absorption strength observed in fig .",
    "the linewidth oscillation of crl and crh at high magnetic fields are expanded in the inset , which display an interesting pattern . while crl s linewidth generally oscillates with the filling factors at high magnetic fields , crh s oscillates at a much faster rate .",
    "if this rate is taken seriously , such a fast oscillation corresponds to an electron density as large as @xmath90 with linewidth maxima at even filling factors ( @xmath53 , @xmath91 , and @xmath68 ) and minima at odd filling factors ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ) , opposite to the crl s linewidth oscillations .",
    "it is very unlikely that such a dense region ( by an order ) is formed in this system .",
    "the maxima of the crh s linewidth corresponds to the fields , where one of the two modes is dominating , while the two minima correspond to the fields where the two modes are of nearly equal strength .",
    "it suggests that the linewidth oscillation for crh mode is also strongly affected by the intensity exchange between the cr splitting .    at around @xmath84 ,",
    "linewidths of both modes collapse , though it is less significant for crl , since its linewidth is decreasing from @xmath83 to @xmath95 . at very high fields ( @xmath96 ) ,",
    "both linewidths remain small and become independent of the magnetic fields or filling factors .",
    "the sharp reduction of photoluminescence linewidth was attributed to a phase transition of the exciton system into an ordered state.@xcite this sharp reduction of cr linewidth could be an effect parallel to that found by fukazawa _",
    "et al . _ , but we lack the evidence supporting that a critical temperature @xmath8 is associated with the narrowing of the cr linewidth .",
    "the cr splitting appear to be temperature - independent up to @xmath97 and it is the highest temperature attainable with our present high - field probe .",
    "many aspects of this work have been discussed and compared with the two most widely used models , the exciton model and the hybridization model . as indicated in the previous sections , neither",
    "one can account for the features found in this paper .",
    "though they appear to be quite different , interlayer coulomb interaction and hybridization of electron - hole wavefunctions share many similar properties . by considering the electron - hole system s hamiltonian as a simple @xmath98 matrix as illustrated by petchsingh _",
    "et al._,@xcite hybridization effect and interlayer coulomb interaction will both appear in the off - diagonal term , thus resulting in similar types of energy characteristics , though an interlayer coulomb interaction is possibly more complicated .",
    "the hybridization model is realized as two intercepting dispersion relations ; one belongs to the electron and the other to the holes .",
    "the minigaps are formed at the intercepts of the electron and hole dispersion relations , i.e. where the @xmath69 wavevectors belonging to different dispersion relations are equal .",
    "coulomb interactions , in the form of @xmath99 , should also have a prominent effect at the intercepts . when the hybridization model is realized in an energy diagram shown in fig .",
    "3 , a minigap of several m@xmath11 is formed when the electron and hole lls are aligned with increasing magnetic field . by contrast , an exciton is formed with a characteristic energy of several mev when the single particle energy gap becomes smaller than the binding energy , i.e. when the electron and hole lls are nearly aligned . for the hybridization model , the @xmath100 model has established an energy diagram for the multiple absorption modes that agree well with the observed mode energies , which may also reflect what is going to occur if the interlayer coulomb interaction is included in the @xmath100 model .",
    "we would like to suggest a small tweak to the original exciton model . as indicated in the sec .",
    "iii e , the crl mode is likely to result from the conventional electron cr , which is a ll transition from @xmath101 to @xmath47 . instead of having exciton internal transitions",
    ", crh is an exciton pair - breaking excitation .",
    "the exciton absorbs the photon energy , breaking the electron - hole pair and the electron makes a ll transition from @xmath101 to @xmath47 ll . as a result ,",
    "its magnetic - field dependence is similar to the electron - ll transition , but is instead offset by the binding energy . since the spin - split ground state ll is fully occupied up to @xmath61 , a pair broken by the thermal excitations can not place the electron back to the ground state , thus rendering it forbidden .",
    "extra thermal energy is needed in order to break the pair and place the electron in the next available ll , which is separated by about @xmath102.(@xmath103 with @xmath104 ) as a result , both modes are insensitive to the temperature changes up to @xmath97 within the magnetic field range investigated .",
    "unfortunately , this concept suffers a severe setback ; since the hole density is much smaller than the electron density .",
    "even if each hole is bound to an electron , the crh mode should remain the weaker mode of the two ; which contradicts observation - unless , we assume that a hole is bound with several electrons forming the many - particle state , which release an electron after it absorbs the photon energy .      as indicated in sec .",
    "iii a , the hybridization model can not account for the cr splitting observed at high magnetic fields , or it will result in multiple absorption mode at low fields .",
    "it does not seem to rule out the possibility that the cr splitting are caused by the spin - split lls as a result of a difference in the @xmath105-factors of lls with different ll index ; in this case , @xmath47 and @xmath48 lls .",
    "we have basically ruled out the spin - split cr as a possible cause for the cr splitting when we ruled out the hybridization model ; since it also arose from a set of spin - split lls . at this juncture",
    ", we will discuss several additional discrepancies between the observed features and the features that is expected if the cr splitting are a result of the spin - split lls .    in the single particle picture ,",
    "such an effect is basically the zeeman splitting , which increases linearly with increasing magnetic field as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the difference in the @xmath105-factor and @xmath108 the bohr magneton .",
    "the observed energy separation is field - independent at high magnetic fields , while being slightly larger at lower magnetic fields . to account for the observed energy separation",
    ", @xmath109 needs to be rather complicated , which has to be field - dependent as @xmath110 at high fields , and as @xmath111 with @xmath112 piecewise defined at the intermediate fields .",
    "additionally , this must occur between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the lineshapes of the cr splitting are not symmetrical , since crh always has a larger linewidth .",
    "this would require the system to have a spin - direction - selective scattering mechanism .",
    "the strength of the two modes are nearly equal for three different fields , which are @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the spin - split cr should have nearly equal contributions at @xmath81 and then one of them , usually the lower - energy transition , increases at the expense of the other one with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the intensity of the two modes of the cr splitting exchange several times between @xmath83 and @xmath95 and there is no way to account for all three magnetic fields , where the intensity of the two modes are nearly equal to each other .",
    "the cr splitting should start to appear at around @xmath117 , which is around @xmath118 with at least three different transition energies .",
    "one is at around the typical cr energy if the @xmath48 and @xmath56 lls have the same @xmath105-factor and a pair of modes offset by @xmath119 .",
    "such splitting has not been observed in this system . in addition , the features observed when the sample is tilted are also against the spin split cr ; in particular , the energy separation increases with increasing tilt angle @xmath73 , while it should be tilt - angle - independent for spin splitting .",
    "it has been proposed that electrons were trapped by the localized states on the surface@xcite or in puddles between repulsive scatterers,@xcite forming regions of higher electron densities , in which the cr energy of the weakly bound electrons in the harmonic traps is shifted to a value @xmath120 where @xmath121 is related to the curvature of the confining potential . at sufficiently high magnetic fields ,",
    "both of the cr and the confinement shifted cr increase linearly with increasing magnetic field , as if the latter offsets from the the former by a constant energy separation .",
    "moreover , the energy separation between the two , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , will be larger at lower magnetic fields , but nearly a constant at high magnetic fields .",
    "it has been argued previously ( iii e ) that the sudden rises in the cr effective mass of both modes may result from a common cause . while it is known that crl s effective mass jump occurs when the filling factor approaches @xmath83 , the jump of crh mode may result from regions of higher electron density , which approaches @xmath83 at higher fields .",
    "we propose that a spontaneous phase separation is induced by increasing magnetic field and the 2des splits into two phases : puddles with the electron density of around @xmath124 surrounded by the region with the electron density of around @xmath80 .",
    "additional confinement shifts up the cr energy in the puddles and the edge scattering of the puddles increases the overall crh linewidth .",
    "although it appears that the confinement shifted cr is described by a simple guadratic sum , it is difficult to formulate the cr energy itself due to strong cr oscillation and nonparabolicity in inas 2des . disregarding cr oscillation and nonparabolicity at high fields , we describe the cr energy phenomenologically by approximating the effective mass jump near @xmath83 with a step function .",
    "cr effective mass is @xmath125 when @xmath126 and @xmath127 when @xmath128 .",
    "the energy of crh mode can then be described by the confinement shifted cr at an appropriate filling factor for puddle s carrier density is higher .",
    "crl and crh mode can be described fairly well by this simple phenomenological model , as shown in the inset of fig . 8 with @xmath129 .",
    "most importantly , this concept can also account for the exchange of the integrated intensity from @xmath3 ( @xmath113 ) to @xmath61 ( @xmath82 ) , which is difficult to explain in terms of the fermi level oscillation .",
    "an energy diagram for the lls in the puddles ( crh ) and in the environment ( crl ) is established in fig . 8 to demonstrate the transfer of the electrons , which leads to the exchange of intensity .",
    "the energies of the ll are plotted to scale based on the measured energies of crl and crh modes at different magnetic fields .",
    "a @xmath105-factor of @xmath130 is applied to the calculated lls,@xcite in order to distinguish lls of different spins states .",
    "the lls in puddles ( crh ) are offset by -@xmath131 to represent an energy trap for the electrons , resulting in the electron density difference . with increasing magnetic field , lls in the puddles and in the environment",
    "pass through the fs at different magnetic fields , resulting in the exchange of the integrated intensity between the cr splitting .",
    "to efficiently and clearly label the lls in the puddles and in the environment , each ll will be labeled as @xmath132 , in which the first part labels whether it is a ll in the puddles or in the environment .",
    "the second part labels the ll by the filling factor , instead of the landau level index for convenience .    at around @xmath3",
    ", @xmath133 passes the fs , and electrons fill up to @xmath134 . the electrons transfer from @xmath134 to @xmath135 , when empty states become available with increasing magnetic fields , since @xmath134 is higher in energy than @xmath136",
    "; therefore , the intensity of crh increases while the intensity of crl decreases .    at around @xmath38 ,",
    "the transfer of the integrated intensity is reversed , since @xmath137 passes the fs .",
    "the electrons now transfer from @xmath136 to @xmath138 , since @xmath139 is lower in energy than @xmath136 ; therefore , the intensity of crh increases while the intensity of crl decreases .",
    "likewise , the transfer of the integrated intensity is reversed again at around @xmath39 when @xmath136 passes the fs and the electrons transfer from the @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
    "the electrons will continue to pool into the puddles until @xmath139 passes the fs .",
    "the size of the puddles can be estimated based on the equation proposed by mikeska _",
    "et al._.@xcite if the depth of the trap is around @xmath131 , the average diameter of the puddles is about @xmath141**. * * the temperature dependence of the cr splitting can be easily explained if the triple point of the phase separation is much higher than @xmath63 .",
    "a possible mechanism involves the holes in the gasb layer , which trap the electrons into puddles through the interlayer coulomb interaction . a quick estimate for the depth of the electron trap yields a value in the appropriate range provided the band bending and",
    "the in - plane screening are ignored .",
    "kallin and halperin@xcite had previously discussed an impurity mode induced by the impurity scattering ; while , in this case , the impurities are the holes on the other side of the barrier .",
    "inas / gasb based type ii and broken - gap quantum wells have been extensively studied in the past as a promising candidate for finding bec of excitons in bilayer 2ds without photoexcitation .",
    "the works in the past have revealed multiple absorption modes near cr which were interpreted in two different models . on one hand , these modes indicated the formation of stable exciton phase , which exhibits an additional mode at the exciton s @xmath17 internal transitions . on the other hand , these modes seem to result from the formation of the minigaps due the hybridization of the electron and hole wavefunctions .",
    "recent studies in these types of materials have been strongly in favor of the hybridization model .",
    "we have studied a series of weakly hybridized inas / alsb / gasb cqws , in which the hybridization effect is minimal by having narrower well width and an alsb barrier interposed between inas and gasb layers .",
    "we have observed a pair of modes , only at magnetic fields higher than @xmath3 , in this series of samples ; whereas , only a single absorption mode , attributed to electron cr , was found in the weakly hybridized samples in the past .",
    "the cr splitting exhibit several features , which are very different from those reported in the past .",
    "the energy separation is slightly larger at lower magnetic field , while it is magnetic - field independent at high magnetic field .",
    "the cr splitting were robust against increasing thermal excitations and increasing parallel magnetic fields .",
    "these key differences are inconsistent with the two models proposed in the past .",
