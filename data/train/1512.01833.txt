    "black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrb ) are powered by accretion from a donor star onto a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the accretion often proceed via an optically thick , geometrically thin , accretion disc @xcite .",
    "systems with low - mass donors usually show recurrent outbursts on a range of timescales , occurring due to a hydrogen - ionization thermal instability ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . after a period of quiescence ,",
    "an outburst starts in the low / hard spectral state , which is characterized by a power - law spectrum in the @xmath0210 kev range with the photon index of @xmath1 and a weak blackbody emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at a later phase of the outburst and at higher accretion rates , the system usually enters the high / soft spectral state @xcite , which is dominated by blackbody emission from the disc ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review of the radiation processes in different states ) .",
    "physically , the hard state has been explained by emission from a hot inner accretion flow @xcite , surrounded by a disc that is truncated far away from the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the standard hot accretion solution corresponds to the gravitational energy transferred predominantly to the ions and coulomb energy transferred to the electrons .",
    "given the relative weakness of the coulomb coupling , the plasma is two - temperature with the ions being close to the virial temperature and the electrons of @xmath2 kev .",
    "also , the weakness of the coupling results in most of the ion energy advected to the bh at low accretion rates ; thus the flow is radiatively inefficient @xcite .",
    "however , the efficiency increases at higher accretion rates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a substantial part of the accreted matter may form an outflow @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the detail , the outer cold disc in this scenario is expected to be truncated @xcite .",
    "the truncation is also required in early stages of an outburst , given that the disc in quiescence does not extend down to the isco @xcite .",
    "when the accretion rate increases further , the truncation radius decreases , the disc starts to penetrate the inner flow and eventually reaches the isco in the high / soft state @xcite .",
    "there is , indeed , strong observational evidence that the disc extends all the way to the isco in the high / soft state , e.g. , @xcite . on the other hand , the actual values of the truncation radius in the low / hard state have been a subject of an intense debate in recent years .",
    "the sources in the low / hard state usually show a soft component , which is often attributed to disc emission .",
    "the truncation radius can be calculated by modelling this component .",
    "in addition , the disc acting as a reflector produces a characteristic spectrum .",
    "the most important feature of the reflected spectrum is the fluorescent fe k@xmath3 line , which is broadened and skewed due to the special and general relativistic effects in regions close to the bh @xcite .",
    "hence , modelling the reflection component provides us another way to measure the disc truncation radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , various studies of the reflection spectra have resulted in conflicting results , with some studies suggesting that the accretion disc extends till the isco ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while some other studies find truncated discs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gx 3394 is a bhxrb where the geometry of the low / hard state is one of the most debated .",
    "a number of studies found the disc extending down to the isco at a luminosity as low as @xmath41 per cent of the eddington luminosity , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "then , @xcite , using the same data as @xcite and @xcite , found a large truncation radius .",
    "they argued that the discrepancy stems from the pile - up in the _ xmm - newton _ mos ccds , which broadens the fe line .",
    "hence , one should avoid using detectors which are severely affected by this effect @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter kdd14 ) calculated the inner radius both from the modelling of the disc and that of the reflected component using the data taken by the _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn detector in timing mode .",
    "though their study indicates highly truncated disc , the radii calculated by the two methods do not agree with each other .",
    "@xcite analysed the _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn data taken in the imaging mode during the 2013 outburst , in which the source always remained in the hard state .",
    "they have found the inner disc radii of @xmath6 from both disc and reflection spectral components .",
    "however , the disc inclination was found to be low , @xmath7 , which , given the large mass function of gx 3394 found by @xcite , would imply an unrealistically high bh mass , @xmath8 ( but see the caveats in section [ gx ] ) . on the other hand , a recent study of the same outburst using a joint _ swift _ xrt and _ nustar _ data found an inclination in the range of @xmath9@xmath10 @xcite .    here",
    ", we attempt to resolve some of the above controversies . for the first time",
    ", we simultaneously analyse all the available data of the source in the low / hard state taken by _",
    "xmm - newton _",
    ", whose high - resolution ccds are crucial for accurate measurements of the reflection features .",
    "we use a large range of spectral models , in order to determine the level of robustness of our conclusions . in section [ gx ] , we describe main properties of gx 3394 . in section [ data ] , we describe the observations and data reduction , while section [ analysis ] describes the analysis method and the techniques that we have developed in order to get robust estimations of the disc inner radius .",
    "the results of our study are given in section [ results ] . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss physical effects related to our results and their implications .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "appendix [ comparison ] compares our results with those of other spectral studies .",
    "appendix [ reflection ] discusses different definitions for the fractional reflection strength .",
    "the orbital period of gx 3394  has been measured by @xcite as @xmath11 d , though some other shorter periods were also found possible .",
    "the above period appears to be confirmed by @xcite , who found @xmath12 d by analysing the _ rxte _ all sky monitor data .",
    "@xcite measured the mass function of @xmath13 .",
    "they used emission lines , and thus the result is less certain than that of absorption lines due to some uncertainty of the location of the emission . @xcite considered some of those uncertainties and argued for the mass function to be higher due to the displacement of the centre of of the emitted light with respect to the donor centre of mass , and , consequently , @xmath14 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite estimated the mass ratio as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 is the mass of the donor .",
    "the highest bh mass measured yet in a low - mass binary is @xmath18 in grs 1915 + 105 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for the dependence on the distance ) . using that mass upper limit and the @xmath19 lower limit on @xmath20 , the binary inclination of gx 3394  is @xmath21 . on the other hand , @xcite estimated the binary inclination to be low , @xmath22 , under the assumption that the velocity separation of the balmer lines corresponds to the disc rim , though @xcite stated that this interpretation was not certain .",
    "we note that an inner part of the disc is aligned with the bh rotation axis , which can then be inclined with respect to the binary orbit , in which case the inclination of the reflecting part of the disc , @xmath23 , can be different than the binary one , @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated the dimensionless bh spin in gx 3394  as @xmath25 while @xcite claimed @xmath26 .",
    "those values remain , in our opinion , to be rather uncertain .",
    "we assume @xmath27 . at this spin ,",
    "the isco is at the radius of @xmath28 ( hereafter @xmath29 gives the radius in the unit of @xmath30 ) .",
    "the actual value of @xmath31 has a little influence on our results because we find generally @xmath32 , at which range the effect of the kerr metric is small .",
    "the source distance is relatively uncertain , estimated at @xmath33 kpc by @xcite , while @xcite constrained it to @xmath34 kpc .",
    "we note that @xcite pointed out that the distance of @xmath015 kpc argued for by @xcite , and often considered as a realistic upper limit to the distance , disagrees with the observed structure of the galaxy .",
    "while gx 3394  at this distance would be @xmath35 kpc below the galactic plane , @xcite associated it with the warped material of the outer galactic disc .",
    "however , @xcite point out that the warp s galactic azimuthal angle is @xmath36 , while that of gx 3394 at @xmath37 kpc would be @xmath38 , ruling out that association .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath39 kpc as the currently best estimate .",
    "we note that @xcite argued for @xmath40 kpc ( and @xmath41 ) based on comparison of the outburst light curves and eddington ratios at state transitions with other bh transients .",
    "gx 3394  appears to be the low - mass bhxrb with the shortest firmly established recurrence time , of the order of a year to a few years .",
    "consequently , it should have the mass transfer rate from the companion close to the the critical value ( dependent on the system parameters ) at which accretion becomes stable @xcite .",
    "the mass - transfer rate can be estimated from the average flux of the system .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath42 erg s@xmath43 for the epoch of mjd 5080053000 .",
    "this corresponds to the average bolometric luminosity of @xmath44 erg s@xmath43 , i.e. , 5 per cent of @xmath5 of a @xmath45 bh at 8 kpc and assuming the h fraction of @xmath46 .",
    "the radiative efficiency , @xmath47 , defined with respect to the mass flow through the inner lagrangian point , @xmath48 , is probably @xmath49 , but it can be much smaller than that in the presence of advection and outflows , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we can write the corresponding mass transfer rate as @xmath50 .",
    "almost the same value , @xmath51 , was obtained for the epoch of mjd 5010055900 by @xcite . according to them ,",
    "this corresponds to about 40 per cent of the critical mass transfer rate .    on the other hand , @xcite calculated the theoretical mass transfer rate in gx 3394  using the model of @xcite ( who used the evolutionary calculations of @xcite ) as @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath5316 times less than the observational estimate of @xcite .",
    "clearly , that theoretical maximum is strongly violated by the observational data .",
    "thus , the results of @xcite for the donor evolutionary status and mass based on those calculations may be not accurate .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t_lamppost ]    case 2(ii ) .",
    "we then test for the presence of an unblurred reflection component .",
    "this is expected , given that the standard accretion disc of @xcite is flared , with the height to radius ratio of @xmath54 , and with a larger exponent in the presence of irradiation .",
    "this effect is not included in relxill , which assumes a flat reflector",
    ". we can take it into account by including another reflection component prior to relativistic blurring , as given by the xillver model @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ t_unblurred ] .",
    "we see the fits are relatively poorly constrained , which is due to the absence of strong relativistic effects in the data , as we found before .",
    "thus , adding an unblurred reflection to a weakly blurred one does not allow a determination of the parameters of both .",
    "still , we find high truncation radii and weak reflection in all the data . for obs .  5",
    ", we obtain an upper limit and the disc can in principle extend down to the isco , but the data are also consistent with a truncated disc . statistically , this additional component does not improve the fit , we obtain @xmath55 by adding 14 more free parameters to the model 2(i ) . for this case",
    ", we have also tried a fit with @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57/dof = 795.5/836 , i.e. , @xmath58 with 7 more dof . in all cases",
    "the reflection fraction is low for both xillver ( 0.060.73 ) and relxill ( 0.100.89 ) .",
    "case 2(iii ) .",
    "we now consider the lamppost geometry @xcite , in which a power - law point source is located on the bh rotation axis and perpendicular to a flat disc surrounding the bh .",
    "it is implemented in the relxilllp model .",
    "the model has been relatively widely used , e.g. , by @xcite for gx 3394 .",
    "the radial profile of the flux irradiating the disc is calculated using gr given the value of the height of the source , @xmath59 .",
    "similarly to the case 2(ii ) , we have found that this model is weakly constrained by the data , with very large ranges of the allowed values of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we have fixed @xmath61 , which model yields a @xmath62 of only @xmath63 with respect to free @xmath60 case .",
    "the results are given in table  [ t_lamppost ] .",
    "thus , the model is consistent with the disc extending down to the isco , but also a truncated disc is allowed .",
    "the latter case may be indicated by the relatively low values of the reflection fraction , in particular for the observations 13 .",
    "however , when the disc extends to the isco , the height of the source is large in most cases , @xmath64 , which implies that relativistic effects are still weak , as the innermost parts of the disc are only weakly irradiated .",
    "the statistical quality of the fit of this model is poor , @xmath57 is high and much worse , @xmath65 , than that of the case 2(i ) . clearly , this model is not statistically preferred .",
    "we have also added an un - blurred component , i.e. , due to reflection from a distant medium subtending a substantial solid angle , to this model .",
    "this has not improved the statistics , yielding @xmath66 , i.e. , an increased reduced @xmath57 compared to the case without the un - blurred reflection .",
    "a further possible complexity possible is to allow for a broken power - law radial profile of the flux incident on the disc .",
    "thus , we allow the emissivity to be @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "we have found that the presence of the additional parameters causes the fit to be rather weakly constrained .",
    "thus , we have fixed the outer index at its standard value , @xmath71 .",
    "we have then found that the best - fit values of @xmath72 are also close to 3 , and , consequently , the model gives results similar to our default case , 2(i ) .",
    "in particular , the disc inner radii are still large , ranging from 42 to 600 at the best fit , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , with the @xmath75 .",
    "the reduced @xmath57 is larger than in the case 2(i ) , which shows that this model is not statistically preferred .",
    "finally , we have also explored the effect of ionization dependent on the radius , which complexity is allowed in the relxill .",
    "this again has not improved the fit and did not lead to constrained results .",
    "similarly to most of the cases above , the obtained values of @xmath60 were high .",
    "our results of large truncation radii are consistent with those of @xcite , which were obtained based on x - ray reverberation time lags , in which the x - ray source irradiates the disc .",
    "those authors analysed the _ xmm - newton _ observations 1 , 23 ( combined ) and 7 , and obtained the time lags decreasing from @xmath014 to @xmath04 ms as the bolometric eddington ratio increases from 0.027 to 0.152 ( see table [ tobs ] ) . in the truncated disc model",
    ", these lags correspond to @xmath60 decreasing from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , which fully agree with the results for our best model , case 2(i ) ( table [ t_best ] ) .",
    "as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fe_line ] , the width of the fe k line complex increases with the decreasing spectral hardness , and the line for obs .  5 , 6",
    ", 7 appears broad . on the other hand",
    ", we always find a significantly truncated disc in our analysis .",
    "the effect we found responsible for the line broadening in addition to the relativistic effects is ionization .",
    "we illustrate it for our case 2(i ) . in order to show the relative contribution of the reflection spectrum ( for relxill ) , we omit it , and then show the resulting data - to - model ratio in fig .",
    "[ ionization_broadening](a ) .",
    "we note that the obs .",
    "13 have both narrow fe lines and low relative reflected continua , whereas the obs .",
    "57 have both broad lines and high reflected continua , with the obs .",
    "4 being intermediate between those two cases . the level of the reflected continuum increases with the ionization parameter ( as the disc is more reflective when more ionized ) and with the reflection fraction .",
    "indeed , both @xmath78 and @xmath79 are much higher for obs .",
    "57 than for 13 , see table [ t_best ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath60 is high for all of the cases , though there is a decreasing trend with the softness , see fig .",
    "[ rin_r ] .",
    "thus , we investigate the effect of the ionization on the line broadening .",
    "we show the the rest - frame reflected spectra ( i.e. , without relativistic effects ) , given by xillver .",
    "we show the model reflected spectra in fig .",
    "[ ionization_broadening](b ) for @xmath80 , 2.7 , 3 , 3.3 and 4 .",
    "specifically the values of @xmath81 and 3.3 correspond closely to our observations with the narrow and broad lines , see table [ t_best ] .",
    "we clearly see that the width of the fe k complex increases with the increasing @xmath82 .",
    "then we show how the relativistic effects further broaden the line in fig .",
    "[ ionization_broadening](c ) .",
    "we use the relxill model for the same values of @xmath82 and for @xmath83 , which is the highest value among the broad - line observations , 57 , corresponding to the obs .",
    "we see some rather modest further broadening .",
    "hence , we conclude that the disc ionization plays a vital role in broadening the line .",
    "we give below a brief qualitative explanation of the physical processes that can lead to this effect , following @xcite .    in xillver",
    ", the reflected spectrum is produced from a plane - parallel slab of uniform density gas irradiated from the top by a power - law spectrum with an exponential high - energy cutoff .",
    "the ionization parameter is defined as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the flux integrated over 11000 ry and @xmath86 is the electron density .",
    "the source function of the radiation transfer equation is given by the ratio of the total emissivity to the total opacity .",
    "the opacity consists of the scattering term , @xmath87 ( given by @xmath86 times the klein - nishina cross section ) , and the atomic absorption term .",
    "the emissivity consists of two parts , the continuum and line emissivity , @xmath88 , and one due to comptonization , equal to @xmath87 times the comptonized mean intensity , @xmath89 .",
    "the probability of compton scattering of a photon with energy , @xmath90 , is approximated by a gaussian profile ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) with the centre at @xmath91 and the half - width , @xmath92 , where @xmath93^{1/2}.   \\label{compton}\\ ] ] with these assumptions , the standard radiation transfer equation is solved iteratively in the range of thomson optical depth of @xmath94 . at each point within the slab , the population levels , temperature , opacity and emissivity are calculated using xstar . as the radiation penetrates within the slab ,",
    "the continuum is modified by both scattering and absorption ( followed by re - emission at different energy ) . at some depth",
    ", recombination leads to a rapid cooling and the temperature falls to @xmath95k .",
    "hence , the temperature structure of the slab is approximately constant followed by a sudden drop after a certain optical depth .",
    "the ionization parameter has two major effects on the temperature structure . for higher ionization parameter ,",
    "first , the temperature of the illuminated region is high , and second , the radiation penetrates deeper the slab .",
    "let us consider our specific cases of @xmath81 and 3.3 . as we see in fig .",
    "[ ionization_broadening](b ) , the latter case leads to a much broader line than the former .",
    "the main differences between these two cases are as follows .",
    "( i ) difference in ionization states : at these ionization levels , there is no fe k@xmath96 emission . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the emission spectrum is rich with many fe k@xmath3 lines in the 6.46.7kev band , while for @xmath98 , the line emission is centred at 6.7kev and 6.9kev of the fe k@xmath3 emission from highly ionized fe .",
    "( ii ) for the former case , the illuminated region of the gas attains a temperature of @xmath99kev , in which case fe k@xmath3 photons are only down - scattered when leaving the disc . in the latter case ,",
    "the temperature is much higher , @xmath100kev . at this temperature ,",
    "the probability of up and down - scattering becomes comparable , see equation ( [ compton ] ) ; hence , the line is symmetrically broadened .",
    "( iii ) in the former case , the photoelectric opacity dominates over scattering in the 10@xmath101ev range , while the opposite occurs for the latter case .",
    "hence , the absorption dominates in the lower ionization case , leading to decreased flux level at both the red and blue wing of the line complex .",
    "( iv ) in the former case , the illuminating radiation fully ionizes the fe only down to @xmath102 , while in the latter case , the ionization continues till @xmath103 . consequently , for higher ionization",
    ", the line complex is produced deeper inside the slab , and the line photons encounter more compton scattering while coming out , which leads to a broader profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have also tested whether the data of obs .",
    "57 are also consistent with low values of @xmath82 and @xmath60 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have modified the case 2(i ) by imposing low values of @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , we fix @xmath104 ( found for obs .",
    "1 ) for all observations . we then obtain a much worse fit with @xmath57/dof = 1119/844 , i.e. , @xmath105 for one less free parameter .",
    "we still find the disc to be truncated , with @xmath60 in the range 20600 . for obs .  7",
    ", we obtain @xmath106 .",
    "although our work is devoted to the analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn data , we have used the simultaneous _ rxte _ pca and hexte data to calculate the bolometric fluxes given in table [ tobs ] , except for the obs .  46 , where we use the spectrum obtained from the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) .",
    "for the hexte data , we choose one or both of the clusters a and b according to their observed count rate and the available background .",
    "we use both the clusters for obs .  2 and 3 , while cluster b is used for obs .  1 . for obs",
    "7 , while the source data was obtained by cluster a , the background is not available .",
    "hence , we could not use the hexte data for this case .",
    "then we fit all the spectra using the model of case 1(i ) .",
    "as a wider energy range is available , the electron temperature of the nthcomp @xmath107 and the cutoff energy of the relxill @xmath108 are initially made free .",
    "however , we found a large difference between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "hence , we put a constraint as @xmath109 except for obs .  7 for which @xmath110 is assumed .",
    "[ xmm_xte ] shows the resulting fits , which clearly show the mismatch of the calibration between _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn and _ rxte _ pca data in the fe k region . for the pca data , we have also checked the effect of applying the calibration correction pcacorr of @xcite , which we found to be negligible , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ xmm_xte ] .",
    "the systematic error applied to the pca data is 0.1% with the pcacorr correction and 0.5% without the correction .",
    "we have checked that the observation times overlap well ; hence , the discrepancy can not come from the difference it .",
    "this apparent calibration difference between the epic - pn and pca may possibly explain the differences between our results and those of @xcite , see appendix [ comparison ] .      as we see in fig .",
    "[ ionization_broadening](a ) , the profiles of the reflection spectra correlate with the spectral slope rather than with the flux .",
    "namely , the obs .",
    "7 has the flux four times that of the obs .",
    "56 , and the obs .  2",
    ", 3 have the flux twice that of the obs .  1 , yet they show very similar spectra within each trio .",
    "this indicates that the basic properties of a state of gx 3394  are determined by the spectral hardness rather than the flux . in the framework of the truncated disc paradigm",
    ", this would imply the disc truncation radius , which determines the spectral properties , depending on the history of a given outburst .",
    "for example , obs .",
    "46 , which took place during the declining phase of ` failed ' ( i.e. , without going to the soft state ) outburst , have apparently similar truncation radius as the obs .",
    "7 , taken during the rise of an outburst . in the case of ionization affecting the line width ( section [ ionization ] ) , our results imply that the ratio of the flux to the disc density is constant for a given spectral hardness .",
    "our results indicate that both disc truncation and ionization are important ; the reflection fraction and the ionization parameter increase and the disc inner radius decreases with the increasing spectral softness .",
    "this is another manifestation of hysteresis , well known to occur in gx 3394 , in which the hard - to - soft transition usually occurs at a much higher @xmath111 than the reverse transition .",
    "hysteresis is a feature of systems in which there are two stable states for the same controlling parameter , the accretion rate in our case .",
    "once a system goes to a given state it stays in it as long as it is physically possible , which leads to the value of the controlling parameter at the transition depending on its direction .",
    "we have done our best to determine the actual disc truncation radius in the hard state . in our best models",
    ", this radius decreases with the softening slope of the x - ray continuum , but it remains high through the hard state , with @xmath60 changing from a few hundred to a few tens as @xmath112 changes from 1.5 to 1.7 .    still , these results are based on currently available models , which still have limitations . in particular , the ionization structure in xillver is calculated for a fixed density , and irradiating photons are assumed to hit the disc at an angle of @xmath113 . relaxing those assumptions may possibly lead to some changes of the results .",
    "we also note that the definition of the reflection fraction in xillver and relxill ( v0.2h ) is phenomenological , which issue we discuss in appendix [ reflection ] .",
    "however , this does not affect our determination of other parameters of the system .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have pointed out that the direct emission is not redshifted in the relxill and relxilllp models , and photons reflected by the disc and returning to it due to light bending are not taken into account .",
    "however , our results show only the presence of only moderate relativistic effects in gx 3394 ; thus , those issues do not affect our results .",
    "then , we have found out that assuming the disc inner radius determined from the reflection and that from the disc continuum are the same leads to an apparently unphysical result , of @xmath60 decreasing for harder spectra .",
    "this is apparently related to the fact that the disc blackbody model ignores the effect of its irradiation by the x - rays emitted above @xmath4 1 kev , which , in the hard state , have the luminosity content an order of magnitude higher than that of the disc itself , see @xcite and kdd14 .",
    "for example , @xcite found that an outer disc region is strongly irradiated , emitting flux in the far uv range significantly exceeding that expected from a standard disc . but the effect of irradiation of the inner disc in x - rays is usually ignored , though the recent study by @xcite takes it into account .",
    "we have tried to circumvent those problems by constraining our fits to energies @xmath114 kev , where the disc contribution is weak .",
    "thus , we do not expect that this would affect our final results for @xmath60 from reflection .",
    "we also note that the normalization of the disc blackbody model is @xmath115 . for weak disc components ,",
    "@xmath60 will be low . in the vicinity of the bh ,",
    "the natural scale length is @xmath30 , and clouds or a small inner disc may be formed with that characteristic size .",
    "this may explain results of papers claiming the disc extending to the isco based on disc fitting . in our work , we have found that we do not require the presence of clouds or a small inner disc , but this may be simply due to the limited statistics of the data .",
    "we have also not explored the effect of using more complex continua , e.g. , two comptonization components , see @xcite and kdd14 .",
    "such complex continua are required by the physics of the accretion .",
    "that complexity may be responsible for the soft components , fitted by us and others as discs .",
    "we have analysed the seven available x - ray observations of gx 3394  in the hard spectral state by _ xmm - newton_. we have jointly fitted the spectral data by comptonization and the currently best available compton reflection code @xcite , relxill . in the fitting , we have assumed the parameters of the interstellar absorption , and the reflector abundances and inclination to be the same for all the data .",
    "we have studied a large array of spectral models , in particular , we have considered in detail a possible contribution from a standard blackbody accretion disc .",
    "also , we have reviewed the parameters of the gx 3394 , and , in particular , its transient behaviour .",
    "our main results are as follows .    in section [ gx ] , we have compared the estimates of the average accretion rate of gx 3394  by @xcite and @xcite , and found them to be in agreement . on the other hand , its theoretical estimates based on the stripped giant model by @xcite yield much lower values , indicating a need to revise these calculations and a tentative character of the current estimates of the properties of the donor .",
    "we have tested whether the inner radius of the blackbody disc in the spectral fits can be set equal to that of the reflector . in order to be able to do it ,",
    "we have modified the diskbbb model ( section [ diskbb ] ) .",
    "however , we have found ( section [ full ] ) that this leads to an unphysical behaviour of the disc truncation radius , which increases with the spectral softness .",
    "this increase is not consistent with either the truncated disc model , in which the truncation radius decreases to the isco when approaching the soft state , or the disc extending down to the isco during all the observations .",
    "this implies that the soft x - ray component is not a standard blackbody disc .",
    "this is fully consistent with the presence of strong disc irradiation by the hard x - rays @xcite , which dominate the total emission by a large factor in the hard state .",
    "we thus treat the soft component phenomenologically in our final models .",
    "we have considered a large range of models , testing among others the effects of the chosen energy range , of adding an unblurred reflection component , and assuming a lamppost geometry .",
    "surprisingly , we have found the effects of relativistic broadening to be relatively weak in all cases . in the coronal models , we find the inner radius to be large , @xmath32 . in the lamppost model , the inner radius is unconstrained , but when we fix it to the isco , we find the height of the source to be large , which also implies a weak relativistic broadening .",
    "still , we find the inner radius in the coronal models to correlate with the x - ray hardness ratio , which is consistent with the truncation radius decreasing from being large in quiescence to the isco in the soft state .",
    "our large values of the disc truncation radius agree well with those determined by @xcite , based on x - ray reverberation time lags , and obtained using the observations 1 , 23 and 7 .",
    "we have found the disc inclination of @xmath116@xmath10 , implying @xmath117 for the case of the disc and binary axes being aligned .",
    "the fitted fe abundance has been found to be approximately solar .",
    "we have also found a strong effect of the disc ionization .",
    "its degree anti - correlates with the hardness , with the ionization parameter becoming very large in our softest states .",
    "this leads to strong spectral broadening due to compton scattering of the reflected photons in the disc , and accounts for the relatively large truncation radii even in the softest studied states .",
    "we have discussed the physics of this effect in section [ ionization ] .",
    "if we constrain the ionization to be weak , the fit strongly worsens but still @xmath118 .    although our study is devoted primarily to the _ xmm - newton _ data , we have also analysed ( section [ xte ] ) the simultaneous _ rxte _ data available for obs .",
    "13 and 7 , in order to determine the bolometric flux .",
    "at this occasion , we have found pronounced differences in the calibration of the epic - pn and the pca in the fe k region , see fig .  [ xmm_xte ] .",
    "this disagreement persists even when the correction proposed by @xcite is applied .",
    "this may explain the differences of our results with respect to those of @xcite , who fitted the pca data only .",
    "we have found that the properties of the reflection component are mostly determined by the spectral hardness , with both the relative strength and the broadening of the reflection spectrum decreasing with the hardness . on the other hand , these properties",
    "are not determined by either the 110 kev or the bolometric flux .",
    "this appears to be one more manifestation of the hysteresis , well known to be present in gx 3394  ( section [ hysteresis ] ) .    in appendix",
    "[ comparison ] , we have compared our results with those of other studies .",
    "we find the differences accounted for by the effect of pileup when fitting the epic - mos data , and by using less advanced spectral models .",
    "still , we have found our results generally consistent with those of @xcite and with a number of fits in @xcite .    in appendix",
    "[ reflection ] , we have discussed in detail the issue of the definition of the fractional reflection strength . we have found that the phenomenological definition based on the 2040 kev flux of the reflected photons used in xillver and relxill v0.2h leads to some unphysical effects .",
    "we advocate the use of the definition based on the ratio of the flux of photons directed in the local frame towards the disc and away from it .",
    "we thank bei you and andrzej niedwiecki for valuable discussions , javier garca for help with the reflection codes , and alberto segreto for providing us with the bat spectrum for the observations 46 .",

    "they did not include a diskbb model .",
    "they found that the values of @xmath60 are close to the isco .",
    "the other parameters found by them ( e.g. , @xmath160 ) have usual values except for the @xmath134 , which was found very high , @xmath161 .",
    "we consider this to be a major caveat for their results .",
    "furthermore , the profiles of the fe k region in fits to simultaneous _ rxte _ pca and _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn data disagree systematically , even including the pca calibration correction of @xcite , see section [ xte ] .",
    "the issue of how to measure the relative strength of reflection is quite complex . in the non - relativistic ( i.e. , neglecting relativistic effects on the propagation of the reflected radiation ) , angle - dependent",
    ", models of pexrav and pexriv ( and the associated convolution models , reflect and ireflect ; @xcite ) , the reflection fraction , @xmath78 , is defined as the ratio of the flux directed towards the observer to that toward the slab .",
    "thus , @xmath162 corresponds to isotropic , optically - thin emission reflected from an infinite slab .",
    "then @xmath78 can be roughly identified with the solid angle , @xmath163 , subtended by the reflector , @xmath164 .",
    "naturally , @xmath165 can also correspond to either the direct emission being not isotropic or a part of the primary source being obscured ( e.g. , in seyfert-2 galaxies ) .",
    "also , some of the reflected radiation can be up - scattered by a hot corona , and thus removed from the reflected spectrum .",
    "the above definitions involve photons hitting the reflecting slab , not those reflected .",
    "the number of the reflected photons can be @xmath166 than that hitting the slab , as the process involves both scattering and absorption .",
    "in general , the albedo integrated over a typical power law spectrum with a high energy cutoff at @xmath4100 kev is @xmath167 , but its value strongly depends on the ionization state .",
    "the above distinction is often not taken into account , with some papers giving the ratio of the reflected to direct fluxes as the reflection fraction .    some models , e.g. , reflionx @xcite ,",
    "do not provide a reflection fraction at all , and instead normalize the reflection strength by the ionization parameter , proportional to the flux incident on the reflector . then",
    ", however , it is unclear what geometry a given model corresponds to .",
    "comparing the direct and reflected fluxes can give a rough estimate , which , however , may be quite inaccurate given the unknown albedo ( dependent on the spectral shape and the degree of ionization ) .",
    "the models we use in this work , xillver and relxill v0.2h , define @xmath78 by the energy flux ratio between the reflected and direct observed spectra in the 2040 kev range regardless of the inclination .",
    "this , unfortunately , leads to quite significant inaccuracies .",
    "we show some examples ( for xillver ) in figs .",
    "[ xillver_pexriv ] and [ afe ] .",
    "[ xillver_pexriv ] shows that xillver yields an approximately correct amplitude of the reflected spectra for an inclination close to face - on , but overestimates it at large viewing angles .",
    "also , we note that the shape of the high - energy cutoff in the reflected spectra becomes incorrect above @xmath4100 kev , due to the scattering treatment of equation ( [ compton ] ) being non - relativistic .",
    "[ afe ] shows that the used range of 2040 kev is also sensitive to the fe abundance , and its change leads to a change of the high - energy reflected continuum , which , as dominated by scattering , should be independent of it .    in our opinion",
    ", the most physical way of defining @xmath78 in the non - relativistic case is that of pexrav / pexriv .",
    "namely , @xmath78 should be defined as the ratio of the flux directed towards the observer to that toward the disc .",
    "this appears straightforward to implement in xillver .",
    "following our discussion , @xcite have implemented that definition in xillver v0.4a .    on the other hand",
    ", further complexity appears when relativistic effects on the photon propagation are taken into account , due to both photons no longer travelling on straight lines and some of them crossing the bh horizon .",
    "these effects can be quite extreme if most of the emission is from close vicinity of a rotating bh .",
    "for a given static reflection model , they can be taken into account , e.g. , using the relconv model @xcite . in the case of xillver ,",
    "the relativistic effects are taken into account by relxill ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "still , relxill defines the reflection strength by the flux ratio in the 2040 kev energy range .",
    "this creates the same problems as shown in figs .",
    "[ xillver_pexriv ] and [ afe ] .",
    "then , @xcite defined the reflection fraction as the ratio of the photon flux hitting the disc to that for photons escaping to infinity .",
    "they show that this ratio can reach very large values , up to @xmath430 , for the maximally rotating bh surrounded by a disc extending down to the isco .",
    "however , this definition disagrees with that in terms of the 2040 kev flux ratio , and the disagreement can be very strong due to the beaming of both direct and reflection radiation toward the equatorial plane of a rotating bh .",
    "for that reason , the definition of @xcite has been implemented in relxill v0.4a @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "our proposal is to directly extend the non - relativistic definition used by pexrav .",
    "the reflection fraction , @xmath78 would be then defined as the ratio of the flux directed toward the disc to that away from it _ in the local frame_. in coronal models , the irradiating flux is usually assumed to be power - law function of the radius .",
    "then , @xmath162 would correspond to the local - frame emission being isotropic at each radius .",
    "if needed , it would be easy to calculate the fractional contribution of reflection in any given photon - energy band by integrating over the model components .    in the lamppost model",
    ", @xmath162 would correspond to the case with an isotropic point source on axis of the bh , and @xmath165 would scale that theoretical reflection spectrum . e.g. , if either @xmath168 or @xmath169 were found in fitting data , it would indicate an inadequacy of the assumed model ."
