    "eclipsing binary star systems ( ebs ) are our primary source of measurements of the properties of stars @xcite .",
    "they are vital tracers of the physical processes which govern stellar structure and evolution @xcite . from time - series photometry and spectroscopy of an eb it is possible to measure the masses and radii of the two stars empirically , and to accuracies of better than 1% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these numbers in turn give the surface gravity and mean density of the stars .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accurately known surface gravities are also very helpful in performing a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the stars @xcite .",
    "the large number of physical properties measurable for ebs makes them prime objects for constraining the predictions of theoretical stellar models .",
    "@xmath0scuti  stars are very promising targets for the study of stellar structure and evolution through asteroseismology ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "they are objects of spectral types a2 to f5 located near the main sequence inside the classical instability strip .",
    "many show a large number of simultaneously excited non - radial pulsation modes driven by the opacity mechanism .",
    "photometric studies have revealed the presence of low - degree ( @xmath4 ) and low - radial order pressure modes ( @xmath5-modes ) @xcite , whereas spectroscopic studies showed that these stars also oscillate with high - degree modes up to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the presence of two unconnected convection zones allows the study of the efficiency of convective flux transport processes @xcite .",
    "the abundance of gravity modes ( @xmath7-modes ) or mixed modes provides the opportunity to study regions close to the stellar core .",
    "although there are several extensive observational studies of @xmath0scuti  stars from both the ground ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the successful application of asteroseismology has been hampered by uncertainty in their fundamental stellar parameters , an unknown mode - selection mechanism , complicated frequency spectra due to the presence of mixed modes and rotation , and the lack or uncertainty of the mode identification .",
    "the corot space mission revealed an immense increase in detected frequencies in a @xmath0scuti  star compared to ground - based data @xcite but its interpretation was largely assigned to stellar granulation rather than all frequencies being due to oscillation modes @xcite .",
    "the study of a @xmath0scuti  star in a binary system provides the possibility to accurately measure its fundamental stellar parameters , greatly helping mode identifications and thus the application of asteroseismology .",
    "one of the main hurdles facing studies of both pulsating stars and eclipsing binaries is the need to obtain extensive high - quality photometry .",
    "the recently - launched _ kepler _",
    "satellite @xcite provides an overwhelming solution to this problem .",
    "_ kepler _ is currently monitoring roughly 150000 pre - selected stars with extremely high photometric precision and a duty cycle close to 100% .",
    "almost all of these stars are observed in long - cadence mode , where the datapoints are sums of 270 consecutive 6s exposures , leading to a sampling rate of 29.4244min .",
    "up to 512 stars at any one time can be observed instead in short - cadence mode , where sets of nine datapoints are summed to provide a sampling rate of 58.84876s .",
    "the high duty cycle means that analyses of stellar pulsations are unaffected by aliasing ( also termed spectral leakage ) problems , and the high photometric precision leads to light curves of unparalleled quality .",
    "kic10661783  was found to be an eb as a result of the asas variability survey of the _ kepler _ field @xcite .",
    "we selected kic10661783  as a good target for the detection of pulsations in the component stars of ebs , and _ kepler _ observations at both long and short cadence were obtained in the framework of the kepler asteroseismic science consortium ( kasc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting light curves clearly exhibit deep total eclipses as well as multi - periodic pulsations with frequencies representative of short - period @xmath0scuti  pulsations .    using the 2mass magnitudes of the system and the infrared flux method",
    "@xcite we find an effective temperature of @xmath8k .",
    "the light contribution of the secondary star will act to lower the @xmath9  found by the irfm , so the primary star will be a few hundred degrees hotter than this @xcite .",
    "some basic observable properties of kic10661783  are collected in table[table : kic ] .",
    "we find that it is a semidetached binary whose evolutionary history will have been strongly affected by interactions and mass transfer between the stars .",
    "this will complicate theoretical analyses of the frequency spectrum of the pulsating primary star , and may in the future require a new theoretical treatment of such objects .",
    "the study of pulsating stars in ebs has the potential to be a remarkably exacting test of theoretical stellar models due to the large number of physical constraints which can be applied . in the case of @xmath0scuti  stars",
    ", the measurement of a large number of frequencies in a star of known mass and radius should enable identification of the pulsation modes .",
    "this previously elusive goal is an important step towards obtaining a proper physical understanding of @xmath0scuti  pulsations . in addition",
    ", it holds the promise of being able to directly detect the spatial distribution of pulsations on a stellar surface via eclipse - mapping techniques , leading in turn to empirical mode identifications .",
    "although few pulsating ebs are known @xcite , _ kepler _ will lead to a major increase in this number .",
    "an alternative approach which is possible for the brightest nearby stars is interferometric observations to pin down the radius of a pulsating star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

[ cols=\"<,>,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         whilst jktebop provided an impeccable fit to the _ kepler _ light curve , the model parameters are not expected to be reliable for stars which are as distorted as the components of kic10661783 .",
    "we have therefore fitted the short - cadence data using the wilson - devinney code @xcite , which implements roche geometry to accurately represent the surface figures of stars in binary systems .",
    "we used the 2004 version of the code ( hereafter referred to as wd2004 ) , with automatic iteration performed using the jktwd wrapper written by js .",
    "the primary and secondary components are referred to as stara and starb , respectively .    in order to save computing time",
    "we combined the light curve into 230 phase bins using the orbital ephemeris obtained in sect.[sec : porb ] , with a finer bin size during the eclipse phases .",
    "the orbital period and time of primary mid - eclipses were then fixed at 1.0 and 0.0 , respectively .",
    "the stars were set to rotate synchronously with the orbital motion .",
    "the gravity darkening coefficients were set to 1.0 for the hotter star , which has a radiative atmosphere , and 0.3 for the cooler star , which probably has a convective atmosphere @xcite .",
    "changes in these values do not have much effect on the light curve solution .",
    "the albedos were set to 1.0 and 0.5 respectively , as expected for stellar atmospheres of this type .",
    "the @xmath9s of the stars were put to 8000k and 6500k and were not adjusted during the fitting process .",
    "we instead fitted directly for the light contributions of the two stars .",
    "the @xmath9s are therefore used only in the specification the initial limb darkening ( ld ) coefficients , and do not affect the shape of the calculated light curves .",
    "the square - root ld law was adopted @xcite and initial coefficients were taken from the tabulations of @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear ld coefficients were fixed and the linear ld coefficient of stara was included as a parameter of the fit @xcite .",
    "other fitted parameters were the potentials of the two stars , their mass ratio and the orbital inclination .",
    "our initial attempts to fit the light curve were not very successful , which is unsurprising given the breathtaking quality of the _ kepler _ light curve .",
    "difficulties centred around matching the eclipses and the outside - eclipse variations simultaneously .",
    "attempts to solve this by fitting for rotational distortions or the gravity brightening exponents of the stars did not help significantly .",
    "we were finally able to obtain a much improved match to the data by including the stellar albedos as fitted parameters .",
    "the drawback to this approach is that the resulting value for the primary star is substantially greater than unity , implying that the reflected / reprocessed light from the stellar surfaces is more than the incident light .",
    "we caution that this should not be taken as evidence for the spontaneous creation of energy or the possibility of a perpetual motion machine .",
    "we attribute this phenomenon to the imperfection of the physics included in eclipsing binary light curve models",
    ".    it may also be the case that the pulsating nature of stara is affecting the light curve more than we expect .",
    "the pulsations were removed from the light curve using their mean amplitudes , whereas the light contribution from stara is variable with orbital phase .",
    "the pulsation amplitudes will be more representative of the outside - eclipse brightness level , and will be overestimated during primary eclipse ( when parts of the pulsating star are masked by its companion ) and underestimated during secondary eclipse ( when the light from the pulsating star is no longer diluted by its colleague ) .",
    "a plot of the binned light curve versus the best wd2004 fit is shown in fig.[fig : plotlcphase ] .",
    "residual pulsation effects are certainly visible as ` waviness ' during the totality of secondary eclipse .",
    "they are probably also existent through primary eclipse but are less obvious to the naked eye .",
    "@xcite presented a study of hd174884 , a late - b - type eb observed by the corot satellite .",
    "these authors found short - period correlations in the residuals of their fit to the light curve , and attributed these to pulsations which were phase - locked to 8 and 13 times the orbital frequency .",
    "such a phenomenon may occur for kic10661783 , and would result in pulsations which do not average down when the light curve is phase - binned .",
    "we finally arrived at two best - fitting light curve models , corresponding to two different binary configurations .",
    "the first is that of a detached binary system ( wd2004 ` mode 0 ' ) , and the other is for the case when the secondary star is filling its roche lobe ( ` mode 5 ' ) .",
    "the quality of the fit it essentially the same for both , so they are statistically indistinguishable with the current photometric data .",
    "the main difference between the two solutions is in the mass ratio , which is 0.25 for the former and 0.06 for the latter .",
    "based on preliminary spectroscopic results we are able to reject the former solution , which means that kic10661783  is a semi - detached eclipsing binary system .",
    "the final characteristics of the semi - detached eclipse model are given in table[tab : wdfix ] ( fixed and control parameters ) and table[tab : lcfit ] ( fitted parameters ) .",
    "the best fit is shown in fig.[fig : plotlcphase ] , for which the root - mean - square of the residuals is 0.95mmag ) .",
    "future work on this eb would benefit from a more extensive light curve , as this would allow the pulsational effects to be better averaged out as well as more accurately modelled during the eclipse phases .",
    "wd2004 returns error estimates calculated from the covariance matrix evaluated around the best fit to the light curve .",
    "these error estimates are known to become optimistic in the presence of correlations between parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to obtain more realistic error estimates we sequentially sliced up the short - cadence light curve into five different datasets , which were individually phase - binned and fitted with the wd2004 code .",
    "the error estimates were then calculated as the standard deviation of the five different values for each fitted parameter .",
    "we did not divide the standard deviations by the square root of the number of estimates for each parameter as we are in the regime where systematic errors dominate the fit ( fig.[fig : plotlcphase ] ) , and these are not averaged down by the provision of more data .",
    "given that we were not able to obtain a perfect fit to the data , there is a systematic error on top of the quoted errorbars which is difficult to assess before improved light curve models become available .",
    "we have presented _ kepler _ photometry of kic10661783 , a semi - detached binary system which shows total eclipses and multi - periodic @xmath0scuti  pulsations .",
    "the _ kepler _ short - cadence and long - cadence data were augmented with superwasp observations in order to precisely measure the orbital period of the system .",
    "the short - cadence data comprise 38000 datapoints obtained over 27days and with a duty cycle of 89% .",
    "these were fitted with the jktebop code in order to obtain a good morphological match to the light curve .",
    "this fit was then subtracted , leaving behind the pulsation signatures .",
    "this residual light curve was subjected to a frequency analysis which revealed at least 68 frequencies of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsation modes and the rest to harmonics of the orbital frequency .",
    "the frequency analysis was curtailed at this point due primarily to the limited frequency resolution of the data .",
    "the remaining unmodelled variation in the residual light curve is mostly pulsations whose frequencies are too closely spaced to be resolved .",
    "the main frequency range of the variability signal lies between 18 and 31  d@xmath1 , and possesses amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag .",
    "one harmonic term ( @xmath2 ) and a few combination frequencies ( @xmath3 ) have been detected .",
    "a dataset covering a longer time interval will enable the detection of hundreds of pulsation frequencies .",
    "from plots of the residuals of the 68-frequency fit to the data , we attribute the pulsation activity to the primary star .",
    "we then removed the pulsation signatures from the short - cadence light curve , leaving behind the variations due to binarity ( eclipses , reflection effect and ellipsoidal effect ) .",
    "the light curve was phase - binned into 230 points , with a denser sampling for the eclipse phases than other phases , and modelled using the wilson - devinney code .",
    "we were able to get a reasonable but not completely satisfactory fit to the binned data , and then only by pushing the albedo of the primary star to a higher value than physically expected .",
    "we diagnose a problem with the approximate treatment of reprocessing and the reflection effect , which becomes apparent for light curves of the spectacular quality now attained by the _ kepler _ satellite .",
    "our fit to the binned light curve is also compromised by the residual pulsation signal apparent in the data .",
    "this arises because the contribution of light from the pulsating primary star  and therefore the pulsation amplitudes  is variable throughout the orbit ( most obviously during primary eclipse ) .    after finding the best fit to the light curve we obtained error estimates for the fitted parameters by splitting the data into five subsets and modelling them individually .",
    "the fractional radii of the two stars ( their radii expressed as a fraction of the semimajor axis ) are measured to precisions of 0.3% and 0.4% , respectively .",
    "we have already begun to obtain spectroscopic radial velocity observations of the two stars which , when combined with the photometric model , will yield direct measurements of the masses and radii of the two stars .",
    "the spectra will also be useful for measuring the @xmath9s and chemical abundances of our target .",
    "although the secondary component contributes only 8.5% of the total light of the system , its atmospheric characteristics should be easily accessible using spectral disentangling techniques .",
    "we are already obtaining additional _ kepler _ photometric observations of kic10661783 , from which we will be able to measure a larger and more precise set of pulsation frequencies . these results",
    "could then be used to identify the pulsation modes of the primary star .",
    "the semi - detached nature of kic10661783  means that it is a member of the class of oea ( oscillating algol ) stars @xcite .",
    "the number of confirmed oea systems is currently only about twenty @xcite , of which one is a high - amplitude @xmath0scuti  pulsator @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in performing asteroseismology from the ground means that the largest number of pulsation frequencies detected in an oea system was previously only eight ( ycam * ? ? ?",
    "kic10661783  is therefore the oea with the richest pulsation spectrum , making it a very promising object for improving our understanding of the physical properties of @xmath0scuti  stars .",
