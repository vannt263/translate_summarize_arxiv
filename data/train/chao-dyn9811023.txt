    "the breathing circle is the time - dependent plane region bounded , instantaneously , by a circle whose radius is a periodic function of time .",
    "the billiard problem on the breathing circle consists on the free motion of a point particle inside this region , colliding elastically with the moving boundary .    as j. koiller , r. markarian and ourselves have showed in @xcite , time varying billiard computations can be performed in the same way as done on rigid billiards .",
    "but , beside the usual coordinates describing static billiards ( for the impact point on the boundary and the direction of the movement ) , one must also introduce the energy and time .",
    "if , for each fixed time , the frozen boundary is a strictly convex plane curve , the associated time - dependent billiards can be modeled by a 4-dimensional , volume preserving diffeomorphism which maps successive impacts with the moving boundary .    in the special case of the breathing circle ,",
    "the angular momentum is conserved , implying a reduction of the model to a 2-dimensional diffeomorphism .",
    "then , using a corollary of herman s _ thorme des courbes translates _ @xcite we prove that if the motion of the moving boundary is sufficiently smooth then , for any admissible initial condition , the particle will move with bounded velocity and therefore will have a bounded gain of energy .",
    "a similar case was studied by levi in ( @xcite  1 ) , where he shows examples of _ pulsating soft circular billiards _ whose energies stay bounded for all time .",
    "the study of time - dependent billiards is motivated by two main questions . from one side ,",
    "it is a natural extension to higher dimensions of the fermi accelerator , studied for instance in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . from another side , among many branches of physics , it is of special interest on the study of the motion of particles inside collectively excited nuclei . on the attempts to understand the origin of dissipation of collective motion in finite fermi systems ( see , for instance ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) models were constructed where the classical part corresponds to time - dependent billiards , especially with multipole resonances ( with the breathing circle corresponding to the monopole mode ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a strictly positive @xmath1-periodic @xmath2 function , @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the ( moving ) boundary of the breathing circle .",
    "suppose that at an instant @xmath5 a particle is on @xmath6 at a point @xmath7 .",
    "let the unitary tangent vector at that point be @xmath8 and the unitary outward normal vector be @xmath9 .",
    "the point on @xmath6 is then given by @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that it leaves the circle from @xmath7 with velocity @xmath11 .",
    "it travels on a straight line and hits the boundary again at an instant @xmath12 at @xmath13 with r_n + 1 = r_n + ( t_n + 1 - t_n ) v_n [ eq : r ] and will then rebound with velocity v_n + 1 = v_n - 2 < v_n , _",

    "[ eq : reb ]    let @xmath14 denote the angular momentum with respect to the center of the breathing circle , then @xmath15 this shows that the angular momentum is conserved at impacts with the moving boundary . as it is also obviously conserved between impacts ( since the particles moves on a straight line with constant velocity ) , angular momentum is conserved along all the movement .",
    "a first easy consequence of this conservation is that a particle never changes orientation with respect to the breathing circle , i.e. , it always rotates in the same direction . in other words , if we introduce the notation @xmath16 , is is easy to verify that @xmath17 is conserved .",
    "another consequence of the conservation of angular momentum is that a particle never stops if its angular momentum is different from zero .",
    "this is because if @xmath18 , as @xmath19 then @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 max @xmath23 .",
    "it also follows that the traveling time of a particle ( between two impacts with the moving boundary ) is bounded , because t_n+1 - t_n = [ eq : trav ] for every @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath25 .",
    "it is , in a certain sense , a natural variable , because it is the normal counterpart of the conserved quantity @xmath17 .    for given @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 initial impact variables , let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the next impact with the breathing circle",
    "let @xmath33    [ lem:1 ] for any fixed @xmath34 and for every @xmath35 with @xmath36 , the map @xmath37 is defined by the formulae : & & i_1 = i_0 - w_1 + ( ( t_1 - t_0 ) - 2 i_0 ) [ eq : i ] + & & ( t_1 - t_0 ) ( ( t_1 - t_0 ) - 2 i_0 ) = r_1 ^ 2 - r_0 ^ 2 [ eq : t ]    equation ( [ eq : t ] ) above is easily obtained after computing @xmath38 from ( [ eq : r ] ) .",
    "now , if the particle moves inside the breathing circle region , it s normal velocity at the impacts must be bigger than the normal velocity of the boundary , i.e. , @xmath39 or , using the variables introduced above , @xmath40 .",
    "this condition implies that ( [ eq : t ] ) has a solution @xmath41 and thus the map is well defined under this assumption .",
    "( in @xcite we have in fact proved a little more : @xmath40 implies @xmath42 . )    on the other hand , from ( [ eq : r ] ) we have that @xmath43 .",
    "this relation together with the rebound formula ( [ eq : reb ] ) yields ( [ eq : i ] ) .    formulae ( [ eq : i ] ) and ( [ eq : t ] ) above are invariant under the translations @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the period of @xmath0 and @xmath24 is any integer .",
    "so , we can take @xmath46 and then the domain of @xmath47 is contained in the cylinder @xmath48 .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that , although time - dependent billiards are described by four variables , the breathing circle only takes two , namely @xmath31 and @xmath49 , the other two independent variables being the ( conserved ) angular momentum and its conjugate variable . moreover , as @xmath50 appears only squared in the calculations , we can suppose @xmath51 .",
