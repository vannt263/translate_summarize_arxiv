    "in the classification of varieties proposed by campana ( @xcite , @xcite ) , a central rle is played by the concept of general type fibrations . roughly speaking ,",
    "a fibration @xmath5 is of general type if either @xmath6 is of general type , or @xmath7 has `` enough multiple fibres '' ( definition [ gtf ] ) .",
    "campana s definition of multiplicity of a fibre is different from the classical one : in the case of surfaces , it is the minimum of the multiplicities of the components of the fibre , while classical multiplicity is the greater common divisor .",
    "although the definitions are different , a first natural question is whether there exists or not a fibration such that the minimum and the g.c.d of the multiplicities of the components of some fibres are different ; let us call such fibres _ @xmath8-fibres_. the problem of existence is solved by a theorem of winters @xcite asserting that a curve with locally planar support such that the multiplicities of its components satisfy a natural combinatorial assumption is the fibre of a surjective proper morphism from a smooth surface to a curve .",
    "winters result thus reduces the question of the existence of @xmath8-fibres to a combinatorial one .",
    "it is however interesting to explicitly construct examples of such fibrations , and in particular it is significant from the point of view of campana s classification to study general type fibrations where the base curve is rational or elliptic .",
    "the arguments used by winters are of very abstract nature ( deformation theory and grothendieck algebrization theorem ) , and do not allow neither to construct explicit examples nor to have any control on the base of the fibration , which is obtained by completion from an affine base .",
    "campana gives in @xcite an example of general type fibrations of genus 13 over @xmath9 with no classical multiple fibres .",
    "the @xmath8-fibres in this example are simply connected .",
    "this implies that classical multiple fibres and @xmath8-fibres are different concepts even from the topological point of view ; indeed , a multiple fibre of a connected fibration can not be simply connected ( see remark [ multversussimply ] ) .",
    "moreover , as these are fibrations over @xmath10 with a simply connected fibre , the total space is simply connected itself ; this means that fibrations with @xmath8-fibres does not have topological restrictions on the fundamental group , as fibrations with classical multiple fibres do ( see remark [ multiple ] ) .",
    "it seems interesting to exibit more @xmath8-fibres , and to construct examples in arbitrary genera .",
    "there are no @xmath8-fibres in genus @xmath3 ; this follows from the classification of singular elliptic fibres done by horikawa @xcite v.7 .",
    "as the @xmath8-fibres are very `` complicated '' , it seems natural to guess that there is an upper bound on the genus of fibrations possessing them .",
    "this note arises from the observation that in the classification of genus @xmath0 fibres done by namikawa - ueno and ogg there are exactly four types of @xmath8-fibres . using the local equations provided in @xcite we construct surfaces with genus two fibrations over @xmath9 and any possible @xmath8-fibre . from these",
    ", we can form general type fibrations over @xmath9 , and we prove that they are simply connected ( theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that genus two fibrations do not admit any multiple fibre in the classical sense ( remark [ nomult ] ) , hence these examples provide another evidence of the difference between the two notions .",
    "our construction is very simple , once one is provided with a local equation for these singular fibres ; we consider a suitable double cover of @xmath11 , and apply the canonical resolution process .",
    "eventually , we perform a base change in order to obtain `` enough '' multiple fibres . as an illustration",
    ", we develop in detail in [ explicituno ] the computations for verifying the existence of the @xmath8-fibre in one case .",
    "thanks to this insight on the resolution of our surfaces , we can investigate their geometry and compute their invariants in some cases ( proposition [ ratio ] ) .",
    "the fibration we construct are in two cases isotrivial , in the other ones not ( remark [ isotrivial ] ) from one of the local equations we can eventually derive very naturally a construction for @xmath8-fibres in any even genus ( theorem [ evengenus ] ) .",
    "let us finally remark that the surfaces here constructed are defined over @xmath12 .",
    "one of the points of view from which campana s classification is of compelling interest , is the study of diophantine problems",
    ". it would be interesting to analyze the density of rational points on these surfaces , in view of bombieri - lang conjecture ( see remark [ density ] ) .",

    "more generally , in @xcite , proposition 1.7 ( see also @xcite section 3.5 ) it is shown that if @xmath22 is a general type fibration , then @xmath14 has kodaira dimension @xmath0 if and only if the genus of @xmath7 is at least @xmath0 .",

    "we will say that a fibre @xmath33 is of campana type , and call it @xmath8-fibre , if it is not a multiple fibre , but @xmath34 .",
    "we now turn to the question of the existence of general type fibrations with @xmath8-fibres .",
    "the following result of winters @xcite holds .",
    "[ winters ] let @xmath35 be any reduced locally planar curve .",
    "let @xmath36 be a collection of positive integers .",
    "if for any @xmath37 , @xmath38 divides @xmath39 , then there exists a proper surjective morphism from a smooth surface to a smooth complete curve such that @xmath40 as a fibre of such a morphism .",
    "[ multversussimply]one has to be aware that winters result does not establish the existence of a fibration , i.e. of a proper morphism with connected fibres .",
    "note for instance that if @xmath41 is any simply connected locally planar reduced curve then for any @xmath42 the curve @xmath43 satisfies the conditions of theorem [ winters ] and hence it can be seen as the fibre of a morphism @xmath22 .",
    "however , necessarily @xmath7 has not connected fibres .",
    "indeed if @xmath7 would be a fibration , the sheaf @xmath44 would be a torsion sheaf on @xmath41 ( @xcite , lemma iii.8.3 ) , so that @xmath45 , a contradiction .",
    "on the other hand , it is immediate to see that the case of a classically multiple fibre is the only case when the morphism of winters is not a fibration :    let @xmath40 be the fibre of a proper surjective morphism @xmath22 from a smooth projective surface @xmath14 to a smooth complete curve @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that @xmath8 is connected and that g.c.d.@xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath7 has connected fibres ; hence , it is a fibration .    consider the stein factorization of @xmath7 @xmath47_{f'}\\ar[rr]^f & & b \\\\ & b'\\ar[ur]_\\gamma\\\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a finite morphism of degree @xmath49 and @xmath50 a fibration ( in particular it has connected fibres ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 has not connected fibres : equivalently @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath8 be as above , and @xmath32 such that @xmath52 .",
    "as @xmath53 , the support of @xmath54 is connected if and only if @xmath55 is a branch point of total ramification for @xmath48 .",
    "but then @xmath56 , hence g.c.d.@xmath57 , contrary to the assumption .    as pointed out in the introduction ,",
    "winters result is not constructive , and in particular it does not guarantee the existence of fibrations with @xmath8-fibres and no multiple fibres , and the existence of general type fibrations over base curves of genus smaller than one .    the first example of fibration with @xmath8-fibres is provided by campana in @xcite , sec .",
    "the author constructs a genus @xmath58 fibration over @xmath9 without multiple fibres and with a fibre made of @xmath59 rational smooth curves all meeting in a point , 3 with multiplicity 2 and 2 with multiplicity 3 , as in figure below .    from this , by performing a suitable base change",
    ", he can produce a surface fibred over @xmath9 with at least @xmath60 fibres of the above type .",
    "moreover , the surface is simply connected , because it has a fibration over @xmath9 with a simply connected fibre .",
    "the fact that @xmath8-fibres do nt exist in genus one follows from the classification of singular elliptic fibres done by horikawa ( @xcite v.7 ) .",
    "it seems natural to think that in low genus no @xmath8-fibres exist .",
    "for instance , it is not hard to see that the lowest possible genus of a @xmath8-fibre made of two irreducible components is @xmath61 , achieved by a curve of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath15 are two smooth rational curves meeting transversally in @xmath60 points .",
    "however , from the lists given by ogg @xcite and by namikawa - ueno @xcite , we see that there are @xmath8-fibres already in genus two .",
    "there are in fact @xmath64 possible configurations , having much more than two irreducible components ; listed in figure 1 below . for the reader",
    "s convenience , we report in the figure the corresponding numbers of ogg s list .",
    "the straight lines in the picture are smooth rational components , the number attached to them are , as usual , their multiplicities .",
    "[ nomult ] the fact of finding @xmath8-fibres of genus two fibrations is another evidence of the difference between this kind of fibres and the multiple ones , because genus two fibrations does not admit multiple fibres .",
    "indeed , this follows from this more general simple remark .",
    "let @xmath65 be a fibration of genus @xmath4 .",
    "then , for any fibre @xmath18 , by the adjunction formula , @xmath66 .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 is a multiple fibre , i.e. @xmath67 , with @xmath68 effective .",
    "then @xmath69 the arithmetic genus of @xmath68 is @xmath70 hence , given any fibration of genus @xmath4 , the multiplicity of the fibres divides @xmath71 .",

    "we construct the surfaces by using the explicit equations for the local deformations of such fibres given by namikawa and ueno .",
    "indeed the two authors give for any fibre a local equation of a family of sextics which realize locally a smooth family with the desired fibre ( some of these equations were also found by ogg ) : @xmath78    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath78    the coordinate @xmath79 is the local coordinate of the base , @xmath80 of the fibre .",
