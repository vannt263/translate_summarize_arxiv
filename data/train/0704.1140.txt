    "in recent years experimental mixtures that closely resemble a hard rod  hard sphere system have been studied ; typically the rods are represented by tobacco mosaic or _",
    "fd_virus particles , while the spheres are represented by polystyrene latex particles or globular proteins @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams found include the isotropic phase , as well as phases with liquid - crystalline symmetry . among these ,",
    "nematic ( n ) and smectic ( sm ) phases have been found .",
    "in addition , bulk demixing transitions , as well as microsegregated phases of various symmetries , have been observed@xcite .",
    "intensive theoretical effort has been devoted to the understanding of these systems .",
    "a useful concept in this effort is that of a _ depletion _ force .",
    "structural and thermodynamic stability of systems consisting of hard particles can be understood solely in terms of entropic effects which , in mixtures , can be reinterpreted as an attractive depletion force .",
    "some studies have been done recently in an attempt to quantify attractive depletion interactions between solute particles , of anisotropic shape , mediated by solvent particles that can be isotropic or possess themselves liquid - crystalline order @xcite .",
    "one of the microsegregated phases that has been observed is the lamellar phase .",
    "this phase , having smectic symmetry , consists of alternate pure layers of rods and spheres .",
    "the lamellar phase can be greatly stabilised with respect to the corresponding smectic phase in the pure  rod fluid , as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the lamellar phase",
    ", depletion forces result from the fact that it is entropically more favourable for spheres to occupy the interstitial space , which creates a large effectively attractive force between adjacent layers of rods ; enhanced smectic  phase stability ensues .    thus far , theoretical studies of the lamellar phase have mostly used , among others , the following approximations : parallel rodlike particles with frozen orientational order , specific particle geometry , onsager theory @xcite and neglect of particle flexibility .",
    "cinacchi et al.@xcite studied the hard - spherocylinder ( hspc)hard - sphere ( hs ) mixture using onsager theory and free particle orientations , but presented phase diagrams including isotropic , nematic and the lamellar phase , without specifically addressing any stability issue . in this paper",
    "we lift stepwise the first three of these restrictions and assess their impact on the enhancement of smectic stability in the mixture with respect to the pure rod system .",
    "density  functional theory is a convenient theoretical tool to study the structure and phase behaviour of soft  condensed matter .",
    "onsager theory is a most successful version of density  functional theory , intended for bodies interacting through hard potentials .",
    "some of the shortcomings of onsager theory are improved by fundamental  measure theory @xcite ( fmt ) , which introduces the fundamental particle measures in the theory and should therefore be quite general .",
    "our theoretical analysis is based on both these density  functional approximations .",
    "specifically , we first use the hspc model within onsager theory to include the orientational degrees of freedom of the rods by means of an orientational distribution function and the associated order parameter .",
    "the results will be discussed in terms of a parameter , @xmath0 , which is directly related to the depletion strength in smectic phases @xcite .",
    "then , we discuss the effect of particle geometry by considering various shapes for the hard particles in the frozen - orientation approximation .",
    "finally , we consider a fmt approximation for mixtures of hard parallelepipeds ( hpar ) and cubes ( hc ) , and analyse it in the context of the zwanzig approximation @xcite ; the latter consists of considering particle orientations to be restricted to three mutually perpendicular axes .",
    "recent advances on the application of fmt to freely rotating particles have focused on anisotropic particles with infinitely narrow breadths ( needles)@xcite . since one of our aims is to investigate how the depletion mechanism changes as the breadth ratio of the particles is varied , these recent developments are not appropriate in our context , and the use of the zwanzig approximation seems to be justified for lack of a better approach .",
    "fmt provides a different theoretical viewpoint with respect to which the predictions of onsager theory can be assessed .",
    "in fact , the main purpose of this part of the work is to assess the impact of a proper inclusion in the theory of pair correlations on the depletion mechanism in smectic phases . in the framework of fmt",
    ", we additionally study in detail the asymptotic limit of @xmath0 with respect to different parameters relating to the aspect ratio of the rod and the relative sizes of hpars and hcs . with a view to completing this study , and based on some expressions used to calculate the @xmath0 parameter , which we evaluate for hard spheres , we speculate that , for hspc  hs mixtures , @xmath3 as the ratio of rod breadth to sphere diameter tends to infinity .    in the following section the general procedure used to locate the nematic ",
    "smectic spinodal line is illustrated ; for the sake of clarity , this is illustrated in the context of onsager theory for a binary mixture of hard rods and hs s . in section [ iii ] the @xmath0 parameter , which is used to quantify the stability of the smectic phase when hs s are added ,",
    "is defined , and a closed expression , valid in the context of onsager theory and parallel rods , is presented .",
    "the results are presented in section [ v ] , which has three subsections .",
    "the first is devoted to the effect of free particle orientations , the second addresses the effect of particle shape and the third contains the results for mixtures of hpar s and hc s , analysed by means of fmt in the zwanzig approximation .",
    "this last subsection is in turn divided into two parts .",
    "the first is devoted to the results obtained by applying onsager theory to the zwanzig hpar ",
    "hc system , while in the second we describe the results from fmt , together with a detailed discussion on the asymptotic limits of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section [ vi ] .",
    "the appendices collect expressions for the fourier transforms of the overlap functions for the various particle geometries explored in the paper , together with a few details on the numerical minimisation of the functional in the context of the frozen  orientation approximation .",
    "an exact expression for @xmath0 in terms of the correlation functions , valid for a general mixture of freely rotating particles , is also included .",
    "explicit expressions for these functions in the zwanzig  onsager and zwanzig  fmt approaches for hpar  hc and hs binary mixtures are provided .",
    "finally , the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath0 parameter , within the framework of fmt , and for the hpar  hc mixture , is described .",
    "the first theory we employ to describe hard rod  hard sphere mixtures is onsager theory , first proposed by onsager@xcite for a pure system of hard rods and extensively used in theoretical approaches to orientational ordering in hard  rod fluids .",
    "it can be regarded as a truncated virial expansion , up to second order in density , of the excess part of the free energy .",
    "thus , it contains the orientational ",
    "dependent second  virial coefficient exactly .",
    "it is a density  functional theory , since the free energy depends functionally on the orientational distribution function .",
    "the extension of onsager theory to mixtures is straightforward ; the reader is referred to ref.@xcite for a detailed account on its implementation for the present model fluids .",
    "we consider a two - component mixture of hard rods and hard spheres labelled with 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the density functional in the onsager approximation , assuming uniaxial smectic symmetry and taking @xmath4 as the coordinate along the smectic layer normal , is written as @xmath5 -\\rho_1(z)s_{\\hbox{\\tiny r}}(q ) \\right.\\nonumber\\\\&&\\left.\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j=1}^2 \\int dz^{\\prime}\\rho_i(z)\\rho_j(z^{\\prime } ) f_{ij}(z - z^{\\prime};q)\\right\\ } , \\label{ons}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the helmholtz free - energy density per unit thermal energy , @xmath7 the smectic layer spacing , @xmath8 is the orientational - entropy density of the hard rods , @xmath9 their orientational order parameter , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are local densities for the two components , and @xmath12 are angular averages of the overlap functions between species @xmath13 and @xmath14 , already integrated in the @xmath15 plane . the procedure used to calculate these averages has been described in detail elsewhere for the case of mixtures of spherocylinders @xcite . in the case where one adopts the popular approximation of considering that particles possess perfect orientational order ( @xmath16 ) , an approximation used in all previous theoretical analyses of the hard - rod  hard - sphere mixture @xcite , the functions @xmath12 can usually be written exactly , depending on the particle geometry .",
    "note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 both depend on @xmath9 , but certainly not @xmath19 . in the nematic phase ,",
    "@xmath20 is a constant .",
    "since we are interested in searching for the nematic - smectic spinodal , we consider the following perturbations on the constant nematic densities : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total mean density , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the molar fractions of the two components , and @xmath25 is the smectic wave number . note that @xmath26 can be positive or negative ; in the case that @xmath27 , smectic layers rich in one of the components will alternately appear , giving rise to a microsegregated smectic phase .",

    "the second equation ensures that instability will occur at some particular @xmath25 vector for the first time , as the density is decreased from above down to the value at the spinodal . for the pure case ( @xmath38 ) the instability equations reduce to @xmath39",
    "these are the equations defining a spinodal to an ordered phase in a pure system : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the fourier transform of the direct correlation function ( in onsager theory @xmath42 ) .",
    "the stability of the nematic phase against smectic - type fluctuations can be quantified in different ways . in this paper",
    "we use the parameter @xmath0 proposed by dogic et al.@xcite in their analysis of the hard - rod - hard - sphere mixture : @xmath43 in this expression @xmath44 is the total packing fraction of the mixture , @xmath45 the partial packing fraction of spheres , and the derivative is evaluated at the nematic - smectic spinodal line .",
    "other definitions are possible ; for example , one could use the spinodal line @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the pressure , instead of @xmath48 . here",
    "we adhere to the @xmath0 parameter as a measure of smectic stability .",
    "it turns out , as shown below , that the @xmath0 parameter can be directly related to the depletion potential , so that @xmath0 contains basic information on depletion forces in the system .",
    "we now obtain a compact expression for @xmath0 in the framework of onsager theory , considering the case of perfect orientational order ( @xmath16 ) . the generalization to free orientational order and a general density functional",
    "is given in the appendix c. our strategy consists of obtaining the nematic ",
    "smectic spinodal line @xmath49 perturbatively in the packing fraction @xmath45 ( i.e. for small values of @xmath45 ) , and then extracting the value of @xmath0 from the first - order term .",
    "we begin by first expanding eqns .",
    "( [ ec ] ) at small @xmath37 .",
    "we assume the expansions @xmath50 where now @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the density and wave - vector , at the @xmath38 spinodal , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the derivatives of @xmath22 and @xmath25 with respect to the molar fraction @xmath37 , at the @xmath38 spinodal , respectively . inserting these equations into the first two of eqns .",

    "the @xmath0 parameter is calculated by solving eqns .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) and then evaluating eqn .",
    "( [ tau ] ) .",
    "we now proceed to show the direct relation existing between the parameter @xmath0 and the depletion interaction between two parallel rods mediated by the solvent particles ( hard spheres ) , at least in the limit where the density of the solvent particles @xmath63 and their diameter , relative to the breadth of the rods , are very small .",
    "these are the conditions under which the asakura ",

    "now @xmath65 and eqn . ( [ tau ] )",

    "( [ imply ] ) relates the @xmath0 coefficient with the depletion potential , and shows that @xmath0 contains basic information on depletion forces . in turn",
    ", it provides a condition under which @xmath0 may be negative , and thus directly links the depletion potential to the enhancement of smectic  phase stability in fluid mixtures of hard rods and spheres .",
    "all previous theoretical analyses of the lamellar phase in the hard - rod  hard - sphere mixtures @xcite have relied on the approximation of considering perfect orientational order . in this section",
    "we assess the impact of this severe approximation on the formation of smectic phases in the hspc / hs mixture . we have investigated a number of hspc / hs mixtures using the original onsager theory , changing the hspc aspect ratio @xmath67 and the hspc breadth relative to the hs diameter , @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the spinodal line @xmath44@xmath45 of the nematic ",
    "smectic transition , for the cases of frozen and free orientations , and for @xmath69 and various values of the scaled hs diameter .",
    "we note that , in all cases shown , the smectic phase is stabilised with respect to the nematic phase ( negative slope at @xmath70 ) on adding hs to the pure hspc fluid ; this is always the case when @xmath71 ( spheres smaller than the cylinder diameter ) .",
    "the effect is amplified when both the hspc aspect ratio length ( @xmath72 ) is increased and the sphere diameter is decreased ( @xmath1 increases ) .",
    "however , the effect is less pronounced when the hspc are free to orient their main axes .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter , shown in fig .",
    "( [ taus ] ) , reflects this behaviour , which points to a less strong depletion effect due to orientational fluctuations .      to investigate the effect of the shape of the rods on the depletion effect and , in turn , on the stability of the smectic phase , vesely@xcite has recently considered parallel - rod models consisting of linear overlapping hard - sphere chains , hard ellipsoids and hard spheroellipsoids . here",
    "we have studied , still in the approximation of frozen orientations , two additional types of hard particles : cylinders ( hcyl ) and parallelepipeds with a square transverse shape ( hpar ) . to minimize the effect of the different particle geometries , the particles were chosen to have the same volume ( see later ) . in all cases",
    "the minority component continues to consist of hard spheres .",
    "the functions @xmath12 , and also their fourier transforms , can be calculated analytically in these cases .",
    "the relevant expressions can be found in the appendix a.    results for the @xmath0 parameter in the case of hcyl / hs and hpar / hs mixtures , along with the previously considered hspc / hs mixtures , are shown in figs . [ final](a)-(c ) .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is plotted against the aspect ratio of the rods @xmath72 in fig . [",

    "finally , the @xmath0 parameter against @xmath1 for different values @xmath72 is plotted in fig . [ final](c ) .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ final](a ) that @xmath0 tends to decrease linearly , becoming negative for sufficiently large aspect ratios .",
    "this effect is more and more pronounced as the diameter of the hs is decreased .",
    "an interesting feature is that , when the diameter of hs is greater than that of the rod , depletion is larger , and therefore smectic stability is enhanced more substantially , as one goes from hpar to hcyl or hspc ( note that these two are very similar ) .",
    "the opposite behaviour ( i.e. depletion in hpar is enhanced with respect to hcyl and hspc ) results when the hs diameter is equal or less than that of the hspc [ fig . [ final](a ) ] . for short rods",
    "@xmath0 exhibits oscillatory behaviour [ see fig . [ final](b ) ] . finally ,",
    "fixing @xmath72 and increasing @xmath1 , we find that the @xmath0 parameter decreases as a cubic power - law in @xmath1 and that its value for hpar is much less than that for hspc or hcyl .    the linear and cubic dependences of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath72 and @xmath1 , respectively , can be elucidated from eqn .",
    "( [ tau ] ) using the fact that the volume ratio can be expressed as @xmath75 for the hcyl case ( the other cases being similar ) , while the squared ratio of fourier transforms of the overlap functions tends asymptotically , for large @xmath72 and @xmath1 , to a constant .",
    "simple calculations give , in this limit , @xmath76 with @xmath77 the reduced wave number of the n ",
    "sm spinodal instability in the one  component system .    to study the effect of a varying particle shape on the phase behaviour of the rod - sphere mixtures , we have performed a full minimization of the helmholtz free - energy functional with respect to smectic - like density profiles of the rods [ @xmath10 ] and spheres [ @xmath11 ] .",
    "the minimization was carried out with respect to the fourier amplitudes of the truncated fourier expansion of the density profiles and smectic wave number ( details are provided in appendix b ) .",
    "the choice of a fourier expansion is justified by the fact that the hs equilibrium density profiles obtained with this minimization differ very significantly from those obtained via the usual single ",
    "amplitude exponential parametrization , as shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the parametrization produces too sharp density peaks in the hs profile , which enhances the depletion effect .",
    "since we would like to compare the results from the density  functional minimization of mixtures composed of rods of different geometries ( hspc , hcyl and hpar ) , a sensible criterion is required to choose the sizes of the particles so as to make sure that these differences arise from the shape and not from different sizes and volumes . for this purpose",
    "we have used three different criteria : ( i ) all particles have the same diameter and the same length , ( ii ) all particles have the same length and the same volume , and ( iii ) all particles have the same aspect ratio and the same volume . comparing the equilibrium density profiles resulting from use of these three criteria , we have concluded that differences between particles are minimised using the third criterion ( these results are not shown here ) .",
    "we have calculated , using the free , i.e. fourier  based , minimization , the phase diagrams of binary mixtures of rods ( hspc , hcyl and hpar ) and hs .",
    "the hspc and hs diameters were taken to be equal and adopted as unit of length .",
    "the aspect ratios of all the rods were set to 10 , all particle volumes being the same .",

    "the resulting phase diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "the first interesting feature of all phase diagrams is the presence of a tricritical point , where the nature of the n ",
    "sm transition changes from second to first order@xcite . for pressures higher than that of the tricritical point ,",
    "the demixing instability region becomes wider .",
    "the width of this demixing window increases for mixtures going from hspc to hcyl and then hpar . this scenario clearly demonstrates that increasing differences in shape between spheres and rods enhance the depletion in smectics , resulting in a wider demixing gap .      in order to check whether the effects presented above are robust with respect to the theory and approximations used , we have analysed a mixture of hpar and hc using fundamental  measure theory in the zwanzig approximation .",
    "zwanzig @xcite introduced a model that considerably reduces the complexities associated with minimising a density - functional that depends on particle orientations .",
    "the approximation consists of restricting the possible orientations of a rod to lie along the three orthogonal axes @xmath82 and @xmath4 , treating a pure system as a three - component mixture ( one component for each orientation ) .",
    "the approximation is very useful and has been used quite substantially . in our fmt context ,",
    "the resulting theory treats spatial correlations very accurately so that it should better describe the onset of smectic order in the nematic fluid .",
    "we have used the hpar - hc system and the zwanzig approximation because in this combination a fmt can be rigorously formulated @xcite .",
    "the zwanzig approximation should not be terribly limiting , since the nematic fluid is well oriented . in order to elucidate the effect of restricted orientations separately from that inherent to the proper inclusion of higher  order correlations , a study of the hpar - hc mixture using a zwanzig  onsager theory , together with that on mixtures of parallel hpar and hc ,",
    "is necessary .      in appendix d",

    "a second conclusion that can be drawn is that when the surface curvature of the rods is very different from that of the other species ( e.g. the case of hpar and hs ) , depletion is enhanced and the smectic phase stabilizes at lower packing fractions as hs become more abundant .",

    "<S> it is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced , and that this effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this particular binary system , comparing our results with those obtained adopting the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations frozen . </S>",
    "<S> we consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres of different diameters , and we treat them within onsager theory . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that depletion effects , and consequently smectic stability , decrease significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when compared with corresponding data based on the frozen  orientation approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these results are discussed in terms of the @xmath0 parameter , which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength . </S>",
    "<S> we present closed expressions for @xmath0 , and show that it is intimately connected with the depletion potential . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyse the effect of particle geometry by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes ( spherocylinders , cylinders and parallelepipeds ) . </S>",
    "<S> we finally provide results based on the zwanzig approximation of a fundamental  measure density  functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of different sizes . in this case , we show that the @xmath0 parameter exhibits a linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard  rod aspect ratio , in conformity with onsager theory , as well as in the limit of large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length , @xmath1 , in contrast to onsager approximation , which predicts @xmath2 . based on both this result and the percus  </S>",
    "<S> yevick approximation for the direct correlation function for a hard sphere binary mixture in the same limit of infinite asymmetry , we speculate that , for spherocylinders and spheres , the @xmath0 parameter should be of order unity as @xmath1 tends to infinity . </S>"
