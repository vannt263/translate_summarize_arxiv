    "<S> mub have practical importance as well . </S>",
    "<S> they play an important role in quantum error correction codes  @xcite , quantum cryptography for secure quantum key exchange  @xcite , quantum state tomography  @xcite , and more recently in the detection of quantum entanglement  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore been of great effort and research interest to construct the complete set of mub . to date , numerous construction methods of complete sets of mub are known in power of prime dimensions @xcite , and each method provides a useful and different insight for the problem of the existence of mub . alas , it is still not known whether complete sets of mub exist in all finite dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> a strong numerical evidence suggests that they do not exist in dimensions which are not power of prime @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new approach for ` unbiasedness ' , by generalizing this notion from bases to measurements . </S>",
    "<S> more particularly , we consider unbiased measurements in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , such that unbiased bases are a special , limiting , case . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this idea enables us to construct _ all _ possible complete sets of @xmath1 mutually unbiased measurements ( mum ) in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if a complete set of mub exists , it must be a particular case of this construction . naturally , this generalization can be useful to study questions relevant to mub . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting question , for example , is how close can @xmath1 mum get to a complete set of mub in a given dimension , say , in dimension 6 ? </S>",
    "<S> beside their relevance to mub , mum may be of interest of their own . </S>",
    "<S> we show that they provide a linear inversion formula for quantum state tomography , and that they abide by entropic uncertainty relation , similar to mub .    in order to formulate the notion of mum , </S>",
    "<S> we first briefly recall the measurement formalism in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> generally , a measurement in quantum mechanics is described by a set of positive operators ( sometimes called measures ) @xmath4 that sum to the identity operator , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of the @xmath6th outcome is given by born s rule , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the state ( statistical operator ) of the quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> this representation of a measurement is therefore called a probability - operator measurement ( pom ) , or equivalently a positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly a basis of a finite - dimensional hilbert space defines both a set of states and a measurement . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , consider a set of @xmath1 mub in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath9 where @xmath10 labels the basis while @xmath11 labels the vectors within a basis . </S>",
    "<S> the set of projectors on the @xmath12th basis vectors , @xmath13 , form a measurement , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , with the defining properties of mub , @xmath17 the @xmath18s can be thus regarded as quantum states and as measurement operators . therefore , the unbiasedness of two bases could be re - stated as a property of two measurements as follows : in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , measurements of two bases are unbiased if and only if when the system is in any state of one basis ( measurement ) , the probability distribution upon measuring it in the second measurement , is completely random .    </S>",
    "<S> the notion of unbiasedness of measurements of bases can be therefore generalized to general measurements . </S>",
    "<S> +    two measurements on a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with @xmath0 elements each , are said to be _ mutually unbiased measurements _ ( mum ) if , and only if , @xmath21    according to this definition , each measurement operator @xmath22 can be also regarded as a quantum state , for which @xmath23 , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , indeed , if the system is in any state , say of @xmath25 , then the probability distribution of measuring it in a second measurement , say @xmath26 , is completely random ( @xmath27 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the inner product of two elements within the same measurement depends on the _ efficiency parameter _ @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of this parameter determines how close the measurements operators to rank one projectors , i.e. , to mub . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is obtained for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the other extreme is @xmath30 , which corresponds to the trivial case where all the measurement operators are equal to the completely mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the efficiency parameter satisfies ,  @xcite .    before moving on </S>",
    "<S> , we note that , within this definition , the purity of the states ( that is , of the measurements operators ) @xmath22 is a constant equals to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> one may consider more general definitions of mum in which the purity of the states depends , for example , on the measurement label @xmath12 and on the outcome label @xmath31 , @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> these definitions , however , result in less symmetric mum , which are the primer objective of our study .    the definition above allows us to construct @xmath1 mum in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> consider an orthogonal basis , @xmath33 , for the space of hermitian , traceless operators acting on a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> such a basis is composed of @xmath34 operators , @xmath35 , satisfy @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we arrange the basis elements on a grid of @xmath38 columns and @xmath1 rows , @xmath39 it is convenient to re - label the operators by a double index @xmath40 according to their ( column , row ) location @xmath41 , @xmath10 , @xmath42 next , we define the @xmath43 operators @xmath44 with @xmath10 , and @xmath45 being the sum of the basis elements on the @xmath12th row , i.e. , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this definition ensures the properties , @xmath47,{\\nonumber\\\\}\\sum_{n=1}^d f^{(b)}_n&=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which will be used later . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , any complete set of mum have this form .    to show that the @xmath22s of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pinf ] ) indeed form mum , one can verify that they satisfy the definition of mum , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the efficiency parameter , given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ effpara ] ) , obtains its maximal value @xmath29 for @xmath54 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the mum are actually mub . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the efficiency parameter is determined by the free parameter @xmath3 , which in turn is set such that @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement implies that the range of @xmath3 is @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the smallest ( negative ) and largest ( positive ) eigenvalues of the operators @xmath60 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fbv ] ) with @xmath50 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> [ since @xmath61 , these operators must have both negative and positive eigenvalues . ] </S>",
    "<S> the larger the @xmath3 , in its magnitude , the larger the efficiency parameter would eventually be . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we define the optimal @xmath3 to be @xmath62 the optimal efficiency parameter of a mum is given by @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of @xmath64 ensures @xmath51 @xmath16 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath64 depends on the particular choice of the operator basis @xmath60 . for a given choice </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath65 sets an upper bound on how close we can get to mub . </S>",
    "<S> the question whether a complete set of mub exists in any finite dimension is then translated to the question whether there exists an operator basis for which @xmath66 . in the supplementary information section </S>",
    "<S> we show that for the case where the traceless hermitian operator basis is the generalized gell - mann operator basis , an optimal efficiency parameter can be analytically calculated , @xmath67 . in a sense , </S>",
    "<S> the gell - mann operator basis is not a good choice for a basis , since the optimal efficiency parameter very close to its minimal value @xmath68 ( except for @xmath69 , for which it equals 1 ) . of course </S>",
    "<S> , one may resort to numerical methods to estimate better value of @xmath65 in a given dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> the mum , share various properties with mub . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the set of the @xmath1 mum of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mupom ] ) are informationally complete , that is , any state of the system is determined completely by the mum outcomes probabilities , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , much like mub , the mum provide a linear inversion relation , @xmath71 where the reconstruction operators @xmath72 associated with the mum are linear function of the outcomes @xmath22 , @xmath73 the reconstruction operators satisfy their defining property , @xmath74 in the supplementary information section we are considering a measurement related to mum with @xmath75 outcomes which , as well , provides a linear inversion formula for quantum state tomography .    beyond the mathematical generalization of mub , </S>",
    "<S> the mum have a physical significance of their own . as discussed above , the mum elements , @xmath22 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pinf ] ) , can be regarded as quantum states , and the outcome of measuring a state of one measurement in any other mum , is completely random . </S>",
    "<S> we now formalize this aspect of complementarity of the mum by showing that they satisfy a non - trivial entropic uncertainty relation similar to the one satisfied by mub . when the latter exist , they satisfy the strong entropic uncertainty relation @xcite , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the shannon entropy of the probability distribution , @xmath78 , associated with measuring the system @xmath8 in mub measurement @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ tm:2 ] the complete set of @xmath1 mum @xmath80 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pinf ] ) in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , satisfies the entropic uncertainty relation , @xmath81 where @xmath28 is the efficiency parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof is given in the supplementary information section . note that the inequality of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mubineq ] ) abide by the mub is a particular instance of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thm2 ] ) for the maximal value of the parameter efficiency @xmath28 , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the mum with an optimal efficiency parameter , @xmath65 , satisfy eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thm2 ] ) with @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> the inequality @xmath83 for @xmath84 $ ] , apparently indicates that the smaller @xmath28 the stronger the inequality . </S>",
    "<S> this counter intuitive result , can be resolved by noting that for the minimum value of @xmath30 , the measurements operators are the completely mixed state , and as such do not provide any information about the state of the system ; hence the uncertainty is the largest . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the uncertainty of each measurement must be taken into account before concluding about mutual unbiasedness of the mum . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , there is a distinction between the uncertainty relation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mubineq ] ) abide by mub and the uncertainty relation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thm2 ] ) abide by general mum . </S>",
    "<S> this distinction originates in the difference between a measurement of a basis and a general measurement , such as mum . to be more precise , lets define a state - dependent uncertainty associated with a measurement @xmath85 as , say , the shannon entropy of its probability distribution , @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> now suppose that @xmath85 is a measurement of a basis . </S>",
    "<S> in this case there always exist states the basis states for which the state - dependent uncertainty is zero . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore reasonable to define a state - independent uncertainty associated with a measurement as the minimum of the state - dependent measurement uncertainty , @xmath87 a measurement has in general an uncertainty @xmath88 larger than than zero . going back to the uncertainty relations , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that since the mub are measurements with zero uncertainty each , the entropic uncertainty relation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mubineq ] ) captures the complementarity , or unbiasedness , aspect of the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , each one of the mum are uncertain in general . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , though eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thm2 ] ) provides an entropic uncertainty relation , it includes the ` self ' uncertainty of each measurement . to account for the unbiasedness feature of the mum we must subtract the uncertainty of each measurement , @xmath89,\\ ] ] so that the proper complementarity entropic uncertainty reads @xmath90 techniques , for example , introduced in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> may be used to calculate @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> we have numerically searched for @xmath91 for the case where the mum are constructed by the generalized gell - mann operator basis as given in the supplementary information section . </S>",
    "<S> searching over @xmath92 states in six - dimensional hilbert space of random rank , we found that the mum satisfy a non - trivial complementarity relation , as described in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : d6 ] and its caption .     as a function of @xmath28 for mum on a six - dimensional hilbert space constructed form the gell - mann operator basis described in the supplementary information section . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath28 plotted is @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> for a given @xmath28 value , the complementarity on the mum is larger than @xmath94 . ]    to conclude , in this work we generalized the notion of unbiasedness of bases , mub , to general measurements , mum . </S>",
    "<S> we constructed the complete set , i.e. , @xmath1 mum in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space , where mub , when exist , are a particular case thereof . this construction can be used to study , either analytically or numerically , the problem of the existence of mub in non power of prime dimensions , and may be helpful to obtain bounds on how close we can get to mub in these cases . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that this mathematical generalization captures the physical essence of unbiased bases in two principle aspects . </S>",
    "<S> first , that the probability of obtaining any outcome upon preparing the system in one of measurement elements , and measuring it in the other measurement , is independent of the prepared state and the measurement outcome . and second , a complete set of mum satisfies a non - trivial entropic uncertainty relation , similar to mub . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this relation answers an interesting question regarding the existence of entropic uncertainty relation among @xmath1 measurement settings in finite @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space  @xcite .    _ </S>",
