    "the conformal einstein field equations ( cefe ) constitute a powerful tool for the global analysis of spacetimes see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the cefe provide a system of field equations for geometric objects defined on a lorentzian manifold @xmath0 ( the so - called _ unphysical spacetime _ ) which is conformally related to a to a spacetime @xmath1 ( the so - called _ physical spacetime _ ) satisfying the ( vacuum ) einstein field equations .",
    "the metrics @xmath2 and @xmath3 are related to each other via a rescaling of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the so - called _ conformal factor_. the cefe have the property of being regular at the points where @xmath6 ( the so - called _ conformal boundary _ ) and a solution thereof implies , wherever @xmath7 , a solution to the einstein field equations .",
    "the great advantage of the conformal point of view provided by the cefe is that it allows to recast global problems in the physical spacetime @xmath1 as local problems in the unphysical one @xmath0 .",
    "the cefe have been extended to include matter sources consisting of suitable trace - free matter see",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "the cefe can be expressed in terms of a _ weyl connection _",
    "( i.e. a connection which is not metric but nevertheless preserves the conformal structure ) to obtain a more general system of field equations the so - called _ extended conformal einstein field equations _ , see @xcite . in",
    "what follows , the conformal field equations expressed in terms of the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath2 will be known as the _",
    "standard cefe_. the analysis of the present article is restricted to this version of the cefe .",
    "the standard cefe can be read as differential conditions on the conformal factor and some concomitants thereof : the schouten tensor , the rescaled weyl tensor and the components of the unphysical metric @xmath2 this version of the equations is known as the _",
    "metric cefe_. alternatively , by supplementing the field equations with the cartan structure equations , one can replace the metric components by the coefficients of a frame and the associated connection coefficients as unknowns . this _ frame version _ of the equations allows a direct translation of the cefe into a spinorial formalism the so - called _",
    "spinorial cefe_.    in view of the tensorial nature of the cefe , in order to make assertions about the existence and properties of their solutions , it is necessary to derive from them a suitable evolution system to which the theory of hyperbolic partial differential equations can be applied .",
    "this procedure is known as a _ hyperbolic reduction_. part of the hyperbolic reduction procedure consists of a specification of the gauge inherent to the equations .",
    "a systematic way of proceeding to the specification of the gauge is through so - called _ gauge source functions_. these functions are associated to derivatives of the field unknowns which are not determined by the field equations .",
    "this idea can be used to extract a first order symmetric hyperbolic system of equations for the field unknowns for the metric , frame and spinorial versions of the standard cefe .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that gauge source functions can be used to obtain , out of the metric conformal field equations , a system of quasilinear wave equations see @xcite .",
    "this particular construction requires the specification of a _ coordinate gauge source function _ and a _ conformal gauge source function _ and is close , in spirit , to the classical treatment of the cauchy problem in general relativity in @xcite see also @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we show how to deduce a system of quasilinear wave equations for the unknowns of the spinorial cefe and analyse its relation to the original set of field equations .",
    "the use of the spinorial cefe ( or , in fact , the frame cefe ) gives access to a wider set of gauge source functions consisting of _ coordinate , frame and conformal gauge source functions_. another advantage of the spinorial version of the cefe is that they have a much simpler algebraic structure than the metric equations .",
    "in fact , one of the features of the spinorial formalism simplifying our analysis is the use of the symmetric operator @xmath8 instead of the usual commutator of covariant derivatives @xmath9 $ ] . as shown in this article , the use of spinors allows a more unified and systematic discussion of the construction of the wave equations and the so - called _ subsidiary system _ needed to show that under suitable conditions a solution to the wave equations implies a solution to the cefe .",
    "as already mentioned , in the spinorial formulation of the cefe the metric is not part of the unknowns .",
    "this observation is important since , whenever the wave operator @xmath10 is applied to any tensor of rank one or more , there will appear derivatives of the connection which , in terms of the metric , represent second order derivatives .",
    "thus , if the metric is part of the unknowns , the principal part of the operator @xmath11 is altered by the presence of these derivatives .",
    "this is an extra complication that needs to be taken into account in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the construction of wave equations to the fields of the cefe gives access to a set of methods of the theory of partial differential equations alternative to that used for first order symmetric hyperbolic systems",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a discussion on this .",
    "for example , the analysis in @xcite is motivated by the analysis of the characteristic problem on a cone for which a detailed theory is available for quasilinear wave equations .    as an application of the hyperbolic reduction procedure put forward in the present article",
    ", we provide an analysis of the non - linear stability of the milne universe .",
    "the milne universe is a spatially flat friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solution to the einstein field equations with vanishing cosmological constant see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the milne universe can be seen to be a part of the minkowski spacetime written in comoving coordinates adapted to the world line of a particle . accordingly , analysing the non - linear stability of the milne universe is essentially equivalent to obtaining a proof of the the semiglobal stability of the minkowski spacetime see @xcite .",
    "the stability of the milne universe has been analysed by different methods in @xcite see also @xcite . in our case",
    "the stability result follows from the theory of quasilinear wave equations , in particular the property of cauchy stability , as given in @xcite . in broad terms , our stability result for the milne universe can be phrased as :    initial data for the conformal wave equations close enough to the data for the milne universe give rise to a solution to the einstein field equations which exist globally to the future and has the an asymptotic structure similar to that of the milne universe .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in section [ section : cefe ] we briefly present the spinorial version of the conformal einstein field equations which will be the starting point of the analysis . in section [ section : waveequations ] , we give the derivation of the wave equations .",

    "the general strategy to answer this question is to use the spinorial wave equations of proposition [ cewe ] to construct a subsidiary system of homogeneous wave equations for the zero - quantities and impose vanishing initial conditions .",
