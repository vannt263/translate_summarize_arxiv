    "this study is an outgrowth of recent investigations based on molecular dynamics simulations for this system @xcite .",

    "such a kinetic theory is obtained here from the asymptotically exact short time limit for the generator of the dynamics , providing both context and a generalization of the analysis in reference 4 to strong electron - electron coupling conditions .",
    "the kinetic theory is solved exactly to express the correlation functions in terms of effective single electron trajectories about the ion and collective excitations via a dielectric function for the non - uniform electron fluid .",
    "for @xmath1 the results reduce to the familiar random phase approximation ( rpa ) with local field effects ( the generalized vlasov approximation of reference 5 ; see also reference 6 for a related nonlinear kinetic equation for dusty plasmas ) .",
    "more generally it constitutes a generalization of the rpa to a non - uniform electron gas , with both ion - electron and electron - electron interactions renormalized by correlations ( the vlasov equation for an electron gas in a periodic potential is discussed in reference 7 ) .",

    "more generally , the markov approximation ( [ 2.12 ] ) upgrades this mean field result to include the effects of equilibrium correlations on all interaction potentials .",
    "thus it is suitable for a discussion of the strong coupling conditions that occur for @xmath63 . the left side of ( [ 2.12 ] ) describes single electron motion about the ion in the effective potential @xmath64 , while the right side describes dynamical screening of this motion .    in summary",
    ", the description of electron dynamical correlations and fluctuations has been reduced in the markovian approximation to @xmath65where @xmath66 is the operator whose kernel is ( [ 2.9 ] ) .",

    "the kinetic equation can be solved exactly in terms of the single particle trajectories about the ion and dielectric function for an inhomogeneous electron gas , describing the dynamical screening due to interactions among the electrons in the presence of the ion .",
    "the details are carried out in appendix appc , and the correlation functions are obtained from that solution in appendix [ appd ] . for the class of correlation functions for which @xmath68 ( i.e. , is independent of the velocity ) the laplace transform of ( [ 2.13 ] ) takes the simpler form@xmath69the dynamics",

    "equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) is the exact short time ( markovian ) form for the dynamic structure factor .",
    "for @xmath1 it becomes the usual random phase approximation ( rpa ) with local field corrections \" ; this means that the bare electron - electron potential has been replaced by @xmath85 ( the corresponding direct correlation function ) to account for exact initial correlations .",
    "the @xmath1 case has been studied in detail for the hydrogen plasma , where this approximation is found to be very good up to moderate plasma coupling strengths over a wide range of space and time scales @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 2.15 ] ) extends this approximation to include the presence of the ion for @xmath86 , corresponding to an inhomogeneous rpa .",
    "a second important example is the autocorrelation function @xmath87 for the electron electric field at the ion , where@xmath88this correlation function also is obtained from the dynamic structure factor @xmath89 by integration@xmath90so @xmath91interestingly , one of the fields is dynamically screened while the other is statically screened,@xmath92",
    "the trajectories of the mean field generator @xmath93 do not represent the dynamics of any given electron , but rather their effective collective representation .",
    "thus , the interactions among many electrons appears in the mean field theory only through their modification of the potentials .",
    "the bound states of the effective potential @xmath94 are representations of real metastable states in the md simulation . at weak coupling",
    "there are few such metastable states and their lifetimes are short compared to the correlation time for the field autocorrelation function . as @xmath0 increases",
    "the stronger coupling gives rise to more metastable states with longer lifetimes .",
    "there is a crossover of these lifetimes to values larger than the correlation time at which point they behave essentially as bound states for the relevant time scales . to isolate the effects of such bound states",
    "it is useful to divide the phase space integral of ( [ 2.13 ] ) into contributions from bound and free parts of that phase space .",
    "the decomposition is defined by the negative and positive energy states for the effective potential @xmath95 . for a given position",
    "@xmath96 there is a maximum velocity @xmath97 above which the total energy is positive@xmath98the single particle equilibrium density for the position and velocity can therefore be divided into two contributions @xmath99for example , integration over the velocity gives the relative contribution of bound states to the density @xmath35 @xmath100where @xmath101 is the thermal velocity of the electron and @xmath102 is the error function . since @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath103 , @xmath104 is an increasing function of @xmath0 for all @xmath96 .",
    "the decomposition ( [ 2.26 ] ) provides the identification of contributions to the correlation functions from bound and free states @xmath105the analysis of the following sections shows that the interesting @xmath0 dependence of electron dynamics can be understood in terms of the relative sizes of these two contributions .",
    "the dielectric function @xmath106 describes a crossover from no screening at short times ( large @xmath107 ) to static screening at large times ( @xmath108 ) .  in the next two sections , the short time form with @xmath109",
    "will be considered . in that case the correlation functions in ( [ 2.14 ] ) become the effective single particle functions @xmath110which are asymptotically exact at short times .",
    "the effects of dynamical screening at longer times are discussed briefly in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the electric field autocorrelation function is particularly instructive since the field is sensitive to configurations closest to the ion .",
    "also , its time integral determines the dominant contribution to the half width of spectral line widths broadened by electrons in many practical caseslewis .",
    "the short time form of ( [ 2.22a ] ) is @xmath111it is shown in appendix [ appa ] that the statically screened field of ( [ 2.22 ] ) simplifies further to@xmath112thus , the number density @xmath113 determines all of the ingredients needed for calculation of @xmath87 .",

    "the electron - electron coupling is therefore weak , but the ion - electron coupling can be very strong , @xmath122 .",
    "these conditions were chosen because previous molecular dynamics studies have been performed at these values @xcite .",
    "it is useful to anticipate the increasing role of bound states with increasing @xmath0 by considering first the time independent covariance @xmath123 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . the sharp increase above @xmath124",
    "is seen to be entirely due to the appearance of the bound states .",
    "similar strong effects on dynamical structure are observed .     as a function of @xmath0.,title=\"fig : \" ] .     and @xmath125,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the results for @xmath87 calculated from ( [ 3.2 ] ) for @xmath126 .",
    "the development of a strong anti - correlation and the decreasing initial correlation time with increasing @xmath0 is evident .",
    "these are the effects noted above , first observed in md simulations @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this two - fold dependence on @xmath0 is provided by figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] showing the contributions from bound and free state contributions for @xmath127 . for @xmath128",
    "the dominant contribution is from free states , which have a monotonic positive decay .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath129 the dominant contribution is from bound states which provide the negative anti - correlation as the sign of the field changes along each trajectory when it passes through apsidal distances .",
    "the time for this change can be estimated by half the period for a circular orbit at position @xmath130 , which is proportional to @xmath131 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed decrease in correlation time in figure fig2 .",
    "further elaboration and explanation is provided by the simple model of the next section .     for @xmath128.,title=\"fig : \" ] .     for @xmath132.,title=\"fig : \" ] .     calculated from kinetic theory and from the simple model for @xmath128 and @xmath133.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the results of this section demonstrate the utility of the kinetic theory for conditions of strong ion - electron coupling .",
    "although only weak electron - electron coupling was considered , the theory is applicable to strong coupling among electrons as well .",
    "also , while attention in this section has been limited to the electric field autocorrelation function it is clear that the analysis applies with equal ease to the dynamic structure factor as well , with only the additional complication of more parameters ( i.e. , two position vectors ) characterizing that function .",
    "the decomposition of the correlation function into bound and free contributions demonstrates that the interesting features associated with increasing @xmath0 can be attributed entirely to the increasing contribution from bound states .",
    "consider again the electric field auto correlation function given by ( 3.2 ) explicitly decomposed into its bound and free contributions@xmath134@xmath135the objective here is to capture the qualitative features of the bound and free contributions in a very simple model that allows further elaboration of their relative roles and the mechanisms involved .",
    "this is accomplished by assuming circular trajectories for the bound states and straight line trajectories for the free states , @xmath136@xmath137here @xmath138 and @xmath139 for circular obits . in this case",
    "the velocity must be orthogonal to @xmath44 with the specified magnitude@xmath140for consistency with newton s equations .",
    "the maxwellian in @xmath141 must therefore be replaced by this restriction on the velocities @xmath142where @xmath143 is the component of @xmath144 orthogonal to @xmath145 .",
    "the factor @xmath104 is given by ( [ 2.27 ] ) and is required by the correct normalization on integration over all velocities . equation ( [ 4.4 ] ) then becomes @xmath146where @xmath147 .",
    "note that these modifications of the trajectories do not affect the initial value , @xmath123 , which is still exact .",
    "one further simplification is made to complete the  model .",
    "the effective potential @xmath54 is replaced by its weak coupling debye form@xmath148where @xmath149 is the debye length and @xmath150 is the quantum regularization length of ( [ 2.1a ] ) .",
    "the corresponding electron density is now the non - linear debye form@xmath151this is exact in the weak coupling limit , with @xmath152 .",
    "more generally , @xmath153 is chosen to give the correct value of @xmath123 using ( [ 4.8 ] ) and ( [ 4.9 ] ) in the exact equation for @xmath123 and adjusting @xmath153 to fit the values obtained from hnc@xmath154with@xmath155table 1 gives the values obtained using @xmath156 from the hnc approximation , for the case @xmath118 and @xmath119 .

    "remarkably , the use of the debye form with the straight line and circular trajectories gives an accurate representation of the kinetic theory results .",
    "this provides the basis for a practical tool for use in more complex conditions , as discussed in the last section , and for other correlation functions , as illustrated in the next section .",
    "the last two sections addressed the short time form ( [ 3.1 ] ) of the correlation functions for which the dielectric function behaves as @xmath157 .",
    "for very long times ( small @xmath158 ) @xmath159 crosses over to represent static screening . at intermediate times",
