    "the use of exactly solvable models and methods leading to analytical solutions has always been important in physics in general .",
    "models of particular interest are those that display some physical correspondence to the physics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) or that may give insights to the difficult task , given its nonperturbative nature , of analyzing the phase structure at finite temperatures and densities .",
    "this is also the kind of situation , regarding phase transitions in a hot and dense medium , that is expected to be realized in the early universe and in the recent experiments involving heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the use of appropriate techniques and models in the context of quantum field theory that can increase our knowledge on this kind of phenomena are then timely and important .",
    "one such phenomenon of topical interest is the study of the chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) in qcd .",
    "however , due to the intrinsic difficulty of approaching directly this study in the context of qcd itself , other more tractable models have been extensively used . among them ,",
    "the simplest fermionic model displaying many properties common to qcd is the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite .",
    "for instance , in 2 + 1 dimensions it can exhibit a discrete spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) that happens for a critical coupling at zero temperature and density , while its spectrum can contain excitations like baryons as well as mesons ( which are composite fermionic states ) . even though it is a quartic interacting fermion model , thus nonrenormalizable ( in 2 + 1 dimensions ) in ordinary perturbation theory , it is renormalizable in a @xmath1 expansion ( where @xmath2 denotes the number of fermion species ) and it is exactly soluble in the large-@xmath2 limit @xcite .",
    "these properties make this effective model one of the simplest and most useful frameworks for understanding some of the important physical features displayed by qcd .    for the reasons above",
    ", the gn model is a perfect laboratory for studying symmetry aspects in a hot and dense medium and outside the qcd realm , the model by its own and its extensions may also have applications in condensed matter physics in the understanding of the properties of fermion liquids and high-@xmath3 superconductivity models @xcite . besides being studied analytically mostly with the large-@xmath2 expansion technique , there are a large number of works studying the gn model numerically from the lattice monte - carlo perspective @xcite ( for an introduction to lattice qcd , its problems in implementation and applications to effective models , like the gn one , see @xcite and references therein ) . among the interesting thermodynamical properties of the gn model demonstrated by the large-@xmath2 technique",
    "is the existence of a line of second order csr in the temperature and chemical potential ( @xmath4 ) plane , starting at a value ( @xmath5 ) and ending , abruptly , at a first order transition point ( @xmath6 ) @xcite . while this phase structure was verified by lattice simulations with finite number of fermion species , @xmath2 , in ref .",
    "@xcite some indication was given for the existence of a first order transition line starting at a tricritical point ( @xmath7 ) and ending at @xmath8 .",
    "however , the precise position of this tricritical point in the phase diagram could not be determined .",
    "even within the @xmath1 expansion , there are no results available on the phase structure of the 2 + 1 dimensional gn model beyond the leading order , due to the appearance of complicate integrals ( note however that there are results up to @xmath9 for the critical exponents @xcite of the bulk transition ) .",
    "it then becomes an important and interesting issue to investigate whether there is indeed a tricritical point for the gn model at finite @xmath2 in 2 + 1 dimensions and by which method we would be able to localize it in a robust form . by doing so , we expect to have a much better understanding of the chiral symmetry restoration problem at finite @xmath10 and @xmath11 not only in this model but also to have eventually a better knowledge of a similar behavior that may happen in qcd or even in analog condensed matter systems . in this work",
    "we study the 2 + 1 dimensional gn model beyond the large-@xmath2 limit and , to obtain its phase diagram at finite @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we make use of the method of the optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) ( also known as linear @xmath12 expansion ) @xcite . here , we discuss how this method can be used to extract useful information , regarding critical quantities , from the landau expansion of the free energy density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model , presenting the opt free energy density . in sec .",

    "let us only emphasize here that though the model is not perturbatively renormalizable , to @xmath50 and within dimensional regularization , we only need standard ( i.e. mass , wave - function , etc ) renormalization counterterms to render the effective potential calculation finite @xcite .",

    "the opt will then gather all powers of @xmath1 corresponding to the ( rainbow ) class of diagram .",
    "in other words , the simple evaluation of a first topologically distinct diagram is already able to bring non - perturbative information concerning that type of contribution .",
    "if one proceeds to order-@xmath47 , information about corrections to the scalar propagator as well as yukawa vertex will enter the perturbative effective potential .",
    "then , the pms will dress up these perturbative contributions and so on .",
    "of course this rather simple opt / pms procedure does not give all the truly non - perturbative and higher order contributions , such as the genuine @xmath68 and higher order corrections , but is just one particular class of graphs that are being resummed in this way .",

    "the coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) can be obtained , respectively , by a second , fourth and sixth derivative of the free energy density expansion at @xmath82 .",
    "higher order terms in the expansion ( [ landau ] ) can be verified to be much smaller than the first order terms and can be consistently neglected .",
    "lets recall that the expression of the free energy in the form ( [ landau ] ) is the simplest one able to exhibit a rich phase structure , allowing also for studying tricritical phenomena .",
    "in particular note that a tricritical point can emerge whenever we have three phases coexisting simultaneously .",
    "for the above potential , eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) , one can have a second order phase transition when the coefficient of the quadratic term vanishes ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 .",
    "a first order transition happens for the case of @xmath85 .",
    "the tricritical point occurs when both the quadratic and quartic coefficients vanish , @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ landau ] ) offers a simple and immediate way for analyzing the phase structure of our model .",
    "for instance , to obtain @xmath3 at @xmath49 one only needs to consider eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) to order-@xmath88 with @xmath89 to assure that the potential is bounded from below .",
    "then , the solution of @xmath90 sets the critical temperature .",
    "however , in order to use landau s expansion we must have @xmath67 in terms of @xmath73 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 only ( apart from @xmath2 and the scale @xmath75 , of course ) . in principle , this can be done by using the pms relation , eq .",
    "( [ pmsselfconsistent ] ) .",
    "as one can easily check the large @xmath2 result , @xmath91 is quickly recovered by solving @xmath90 with the latter obtained from eq .",
    "( [ vlde1ddim ] ) with @xmath92 .",

    "can then be easily solved numerically by iteration .",
    "let us consider the first order ( in the iteration ) approximate pms solution ( pms1 )    @xmath94    and to access the convergence of the solutions , let us also consider the next approximation ( pms2 ) by doing @xmath95 on the right hand side of eq .",

    "i we compare the results given by pms1 and pms2 with the analytical relation @xmath96 $ ] , eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) , for @xmath49 .",
    ".the critical temperature , @xmath3 ( at @xmath49 and in units of @xmath75 ) , obtained with the opt in three alternative ways for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "we have considered as much digits as we needed to establish eventual numerical differences . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is also possible to express and analyze the phase diagram in terms of the pressure @xmath97 and density @xmath98 , defined respectively by @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this was done in @xcite , where it was shown the existence of a chiral broken / restored coexistence phase ( the analog of a liquid - gas phase ) , whose result is a direct consequence of the existence of the tricritical point seen in fig . [ phase ] . at this point one",
    "may wonder how the consideration of the order-@xmath47 terms , which contains additional @xmath1 as well as new @xmath68 corrections , would affect the first order results .",
    "clearly , at @xmath101 and @xmath102 the explicit evaluation of all the three loop contributions is a rather difficult task .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , a lengthy evaluation of those contributions has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite showing that the potential corrections to the @xmath36 results are not negligible but remain under control , about a few percent .",
    "for example , the result obtained for the scalar field vacuum expectation value at @xmath48 and @xmath49 is found to be ( at @xmath103 ) @xmath104 at @xmath105 , for a reasonable choice of the arbitrary renormalization scale , chosen as given by @xmath75 , while at @xmath106 it is @xmath107 . for larger values of @xmath2",
    "the difference gets even smaller , in conformity with the large-@xmath2 results ( since at @xmath108 the opt converges exactly to the large-@xmath2 results @xcite ) .",
    "this then hints on the accuracy and quick convergence of the order-@xmath12 results discussed in this letter .",
    "in conclusion , by studying the 2 + 1 dimensional four - fermion gn model with discrete chiral symmetry in terms of the opt , we have shown how this method can be advantageous compared to the widely used large-@xmath2 and monte carlo approximations .",
    "here we have presented precise analytical expressions for the order parameter @xmath71 ( at @xmath69 ) , the critical temperature @xmath3 ( at @xmath49 ) , and the critical chemical potential @xmath109 ( at @xmath48 ) for csr which are valid for any values of @xmath2 already at lowest order in the opt . as usual",
    ", all these relations exactly reproduce the standard large-@xmath2 results when the @xmath58 limit is taken .",
    "we were also able to precisely locate a tricritical point in the @xmath13 phase diagram not seen using the large-@xmath2 approximation and also not obtained before using other methods , though numerical simulations seemed to indicate its presence .",
    "we have discovered that , due to the finite @xmath2 effects , the model behaves as a van der waals liquid in which a coexistent liquid - gas phase does exist .",
    "the observed metastable region is rather small , which possibly explains why its observation was missed in ref .",
    "@xcite and previous works .",
    "all these results seem to survive when going to higher orders in the opt , as we discussed in the last section . in this letter",
    "we have extended our previous applications of the opt to the gross - neveu model @xcite by analyzing how the method can be applied to the landau expansion for the free energy density in order to determine the value of critical quantities in a way that is less time consuming than the straight numerical methods used in refs .",
    "we have shown that this is possible if one considers further approximations in the optimization equations .",
    "however , the numerical effects of such approximations , even at the first level , turn out to be negligible .    concerning the next order opt corrections we have checked in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for @xmath53 , @xmath103 , and a reasonable choice of renormalization scale the differences for the order parameter are about @xmath110 . as for the @xmath1 expansion we are not in position to speculate what a complete next to the leading @xmath68 order calculation would give from a quantitatively perspective .",
    "however , we believe that it should point out to the existence of a tricritical point in the @xmath111 plane since , according to our work , this seems to be an effect of finite @xmath2 corrections which is also supported by monte carlo applications @xcite",
    ".    possible follow - ups to this work that would be interesting to investigate regard the possible existence of a kind of nuclear matter state around @xmath109 , at large @xmath11 and low @xmath10 , for which the chiral phase would be degenerate with a baryonic phase , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this is still an unsettled question in the literature and that could be ideally addressed with the opt .",
    "another interesting work would be to evaluate the various critical ( and tricritical ) exponents , determining whether they belong to the mean - field universality class or the ising universality class in two dimensions .",
    "this is also a controversial point concerning the gn model , with no clear answer so far in the literature .",
    "based on its recent success in dealing with critical theories @xcite we expect that the method employed here will be a valuable tool in these analysis providing us with a better understanding of the chiral symmetry behavior in a hot and dense medium .",
    "finally , we point out that since the gn model is part of a larger class of four - fermi models , e.g. the nambu - jona - lasinio type of models commonly used in nuclear physics problems and as an effective model for qcd , or even its non - relativistic version , used in the study of planar superconductors and low dimensional fermionic systems ( like fermi gases in atomic physics ) , we expect that not only our results but also the opt method used to obtain them can be of interest and have applications in these areas as well .",
    "in particular , we believe that the success of the opt method in redrawing the phase diagram of the three dimensional gn model could certainly attract the attention of condensed matter as well as nuclear physicists to this method as an alternative tool to the well known large-@xmath2 and monte carlo techniques , which are currently used in an interdisciplinary manner .",
