    "much of this work has focused on reproducing the mass - size relation .",
    "this fundamental relation describes how the sizes of galaxies scale with their stellar mass .",
    "the relation is a projection of the fundamental plane @xcite , an inherent relation for all dispersion supported galaxies and is typically very tight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there are interesting trends that remain to be studied in greater detail . for example",
    ", @xcite found that the merger of two similar late - type galaxies produced an apparent flattening of the mass - size relation of the remnant spheroid and that disc instabilities were responsible for growing the bulge .",
    "@xcite found a similar flattening , but they attributed it to the lack of gas in the merging galaxies .",
    "there is also evidence that bulges are not present - day elliptical galaxies embedded in discs @xcite as they exhibit different mass - size relations .",
    "the gas content of a merger progenitor can determine the size of the virialized remnant as it controls the amount of energy that can be lost as a result of dissipation .",
    "gas - rich ( ` wet ' ) mergers tend to dissipate orbital energy , which shrinks the effective size of the system as the gas cools .",
    "the light profile of such a galaxy will have a higher stellar surface density due to the increasing central concentration of stars ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however gas - poor ( ` dry ' ) mergers maintain this energy in stellar orbits , keeping the galaxy puffed up .",
    "violent relaxation can mimic dry mergers by ejecting stars into the outer regions of galaxies , making the light profile extend to larger radii .",
    "discs can regrow and be replenished around these merger remnants both by diffuse infall from the surroundings and by gas accreted from satellite galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although one might expect discs to be destroyed in the merging process itself , both @xcite and @xcite ( amongst others ) demonstrated that discs can quickly reform during the merger with sufficiently gas - rich progenitor galaxies .",
    "the bulge is then built very slowly with little angular momentum , keeping it small .",
    "finally , the bulge component of disc galaxies can also form via secular instabilities in the disc , transferring some disc material into the bulge component ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite have recently demonstrated with semi - analytic models of galaxy evolution @xcite that the mass - size relation flattens for spheroidal galaxies formed by _ dissipationless _ processes below a critical mass of .",
    "this result differs from their sample of observations of early - type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . the pure power law description of their data was suggested to be the result of _ dissipation _ of energy due to wet mergers . the flattening effect seen below a critical mass",
    "is believed to be an event of dry mergers as the excess energy puffs up the spheroidal component of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite also simulated several mergers of different masses and different gas contents .",
    "they found that when dry mergers are turned off ( i.e. only wet mergers ) ; the sizes are much smaller than expected , although the mass - size relation still remains more or less a power law .",
    "when gas was treated like stars ( i.e. no dissipation ) , a power law similar to the ` no dry merger ' case resulted ; however , these sizes are larger than those from wet mergers .",
    "these two studies show that the size of the bulges in gas - rich galaxies seems to be smaller than their dry - merging counterparts .",
    "however , both pieces of work disagree on how strong the effects of dissipation are as their mass - size relations are inconsistent with each other , especially with the flattening seen by @xcite at low masses .    in order to better understand the effects of dissipation on the formation of the spheroidal components of galaxies , we study the mass - size relations of two very large spheroidal subsamples , namely bulges and pure spheroids , and compare them with expectations from theoretical models .",
    "the careful , quantitative selection of our subsamples , derivation of spheroid masses and the characterization of the mass - size relation are described in section  [ data ] .",
    "our results are discussed in section  [ results ] .",
    "the cosmology adopted throughout this paper is ( @xmath1 ) = ( 70 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) .",
    "the taxonomy of describing galaxy subcomponents in the literature is quite diverse . in addition to galaxy discs , the literature is filled with pseudo - bulges , classical bulges , lenticulars , and spheroidals just to name a few @xcite .",
    "we adopt  spheroid \" here to describe the structural component of a galaxy that is not a disc ( and not a bar ) .",
    "spheroids can then be divided into two categories : bulges which are spheroids embedded in discs and pure spheroids which correspond to single component galaxies .",
    "we seek to quantitatively define bulge and pure spheroid subsamples by applying a set of selection criteria to the large catalogues of @xmath3 bulge+disc decompositions and stellar masses presented by @xcite ( s11 hereafter ) and @xcite ( m14 hereafter ) for spectroscopically - observed galaxies in the legacy area of the sdss data release seven @xcite . even though the parameters of the s11 decompositions do match those measured from deeper , higher resolution observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the spatial resolution of sdss images is unfortunately insufficient over the magnitude range of our sample to accurately measure the srsic index of the bulge itself .",
    "we therefore can not differentiate between different kinds of bulge profiles .",
    "furthermore , our photometric decompositions can not differentiate between virially - supported or disc - like ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) structures without any kinematic data .",
    "we start by selecting galaxies with effective @xmath4-band surface brightness @xmath5 , sdss data base flag specclass = 2 and spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath6 .",
    "the cut on surface brightness was necessary as fainter galaxies up to @xmath7 were only targeted when the global and local sky values were within 0.5 mag of each other .",
    "the specclass flag selects objects that have been identified as galaxies on the basis of their spectral energy distribution .",
    "the redshift selection ensures that peculiar velocities do not dominate the distance determination of galaxies in our sample .",
    "we applied a quality control criterion to our sdss catalogues .",
    "we used @xmath8 to keep only galaxies for which the sum of their individual bulge and disc masses is within @xmath9 of their total stellar mass as a consistency check ( as discussed in m14 ) .",
    "m14 discuss the classification of galaxies based on their 1d profiles into one of four types : ( 1 ) those dominated by the bulge component , ( 2 ) those dominated by a disc component , ( 3 ) those which host a classical bulge+disc ( ` b+d ' ) configuration , and others that do not fit these categories .",
    "for the purposes of this work we rely on profile types 1 and 3 .",
    "for a bulge within a disc , we require that the galaxy be classified as a profile type 3 . however , it is unclear in the profile fitting whether a pure spheroid system is best fitted by either a single bulge component ( type 1 ) or b+d configuration ( type 3 ) .",
    "to ensure we are correctly selecting the single - component spheroids and not including the b+d systems , we use the @xmath10-test probability ( @xmath11 ) calculated in s11 which indicates whether a given galaxy is better fitted with the pure srsic ( ` ps ' ) model rather than the b+d model .",
    "this image modelling was originally performed using the sdss @xmath12 images but has since been extended to the @xmath13 filter set to compute galaxy , bulge and disc stellar masses as described in m14 .",
    "therefore , the distinction between pure spheroids and bulges is made on the basis of @xmath11 , the profile type , and the @xmath4-band bulge fraction ( @xmath14 ) . as shown in figure 12 of s11 , the combined criteria @xmath15 and @xmath16 select galaxies for which two - component fitting is required , and the combined criteria @xmath17 and @xmath18 select single - component galaxies .",
    "the profile type further refines the sample and ensures that the @xmath11 cut is indeed a physical representation of the light profile .",
    "the remaining three selection criteria are disc inclination @xmath19 , ellipticity @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and effective radius @xmath22 .",
    "internal extinction can have a significant impact on measured structural parameters @xcite . given that our bulge subsample was still quite large at this point",
    ", we opted to keep only bulges in face - on ( @xmath23 ) galaxies to improve the quality of this subsample .",
    "one difficulty with bulge+disc decompositions of galaxy images is that strong bars can be mistaken for bulges .",
    "the signature of this problem is a very high bulge elllipticity .",
    "selecting galaxies with @xmath24 is sufficient to remove bars from the bulge subsample .",
    "finally , we required that the bulge effective radius be smaller than the disc .",
    "our selection criteria are summarized in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    ".selection criteria and subsample sizes .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : cuts ]      we build our mass - size relations using the stellar mass ( ) , the maximum volume sampled ( @xmath25 ) , and the bulge or spheroid radius @xmath26 in kiloparsecs .",
    "the radii given in s11 are measured along the semimajor axes of the galaxies .",
    "we circularize these radii using the well - known relation    @xmath27    @xmath28 is hereafter simply denoted @xmath29 .",
    "the stellar masses are taken from m14 .",
    "they are estimated from the comparison of the galaxies _ ugriz _ spectral energy distributions with a large grid of photometric templates which encompasses a range of ages , metallicities , star - formation histories and dust contents .",
    "this grid is generated from the flexible stellar population synthesis code @xcite in conjunction with a chabrier initial mass function @xcite .",
    "this methodology was applied independently to both bulges and discs , deriving the masses from the flux in the regions identified by the s11 decompositions .",
    "the errors are typically @xmath30 0.15@xmath310.2 dex , and include the statistical uncertainties from the total fluxes and bulge - to - total ratios measured by s11 .",
    "figure [ fig : grscl ] shows the distributions in the mass - size plane of the entire sample , the b+d subsample , and the ps subsample .",
    "both subsamples show a well - defined trend in the mass - size relation , with little scatter ( in particular the ps subset ) . however , there is a large amount of scatter at the low mass end in the b+d subsample .",
    "it is apparent that both subsamples do _ not _ have similar trends , as the majority of b+d systems tend to have smaller sizes for a given mass than their ps counterparts . to compare to previous work ,",
    "the observed mass - size data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have been included in the middle panel of figure [ fig : grscl ] .",
    "although the distributions do not line up exactly , it is apparent that the spheroid subsample is very similar to the previous measurements .",
    "we see the same flattening in the bulge mass - size relation at low masses as reported in @xcite .     the mass - size relation for ( a ) the entire sample ; ( b ) the b+d subsample ; and ( c ) the pure spheroid subsample using the @xmath25-corrected space density of our subsamples .",

    "( where @xmath25 is the maximum volume over which a galaxy can be observed from the m14 catalogues ) for each mass bin .",
    "although the scatter for bulges in the lower mass bins is not quite gaussian , with an extra tail at smaller radii , a gauss - hermite expansion of the size functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yields mean sizes that agree with the medians to within 0.05 dex .",
    "stellar mass - size relations for bulges ( blue circles ) and spheroids ( green triangles ) using the median sizes shown in figure [ fig : hist ] .",

    "have also been included .",
    "these models investigate the predicted mass - size relation at @xmath38 by : ( i ) excluding mergers with dissipation ( treating gas particles like stars ) , and ( ii ) excluding dry mergers .",
    "these two extreme cases produce size mass relations that are parallel to one another , but where the sizes of the bulges in dry mergers are larger than in the gas - rich case .",
    "the existence of two distinct mass - size relations in the data , that are also parallel , yet offset , is strong evidence that bulges and pure spheroids form from different types of mergers .",
    "_ bulges are not simply pure spheroids wrapped in discs_. this is in agreement with previous studies @xcite , although our work has a more rigorously defined sample of bulges and spheroids and exceeds the sample sizes of previous works by at least an order of magnitude .    the @xcite models show a large spread in the srsic index ( predominantly between @xmath39 ) for the progenitor bulge - like structures . to test the effects of assuming a classical b+d decomposition over a free srsic index+disc profile , figure",
    "[ fig : mass - size ] shows the mass - size relation for bulges with srsic within two bins ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; blue grey and unfilled circles , respectively ) from the s11 catalogue .",
    "the masses were derived using the g - r colours in @xcite as m14 did not derive masses for these free @xmath33 fits .",
    "overall , there is no great difference between assuming @xmath3 or adopting a best fitting @xmath33 for the bulge fits for the highest mass bin in figure [ fig : mass - size ] , the points agree within the 1@xmath42 range . ] with this data set , therefore we continue to use @xmath3 to represent the populations of bulges .",
    "the first remarkable feature of these relations is their behaviour at masses higher than .",
    "the two relations are clearly shifted with respect to each other , with pure spheroids being 1.4@xmath43 larger than bulges at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "this offset is so constant over the mass range @xmath44 that both relations would lie directly on top of each other if this shift were applied to the bulges .",
    "they almost follow lines of constant stellar mass surface density ( @xmath45 ) in contrast to the virial theorem , which at fixed velocity dispersion , would have @xmath46 .",
    "the ` no - dry ' ( ` wet ' ) merger model of @xcite reproduces the mass - size relation of bulges very well , but neither model is a good match overall to the pure spheroid mass - size relation .",
    "the observed relation of pure spheroids approaches the ` no dissipation ' ( ` dry ' ) model at the highest stellar masses but falls significantly below it for log @xmath47 . clearly , the process that led to the formation of the pure spheroids was not entirely dissipationless , and was therefore likely a mix of wet and dry mergers .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who found that present - day , massive early - type galaxies could not have formed entirely through dry merging .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite have recently identified a specific sample of elliptical galaxies with enhanced star formation rates and nuclear activity that they propose to be the result of a merger .",
    "the second notable feature of these relations is the flattening of size with decreasing mass below .",
    "this flattening was also observed by @xcite , and , although they attributed this flattening to a lack of dissipation , none of the hopkins et al .",
    "model curves reproduces this behaviour well .",
    "bulge formation through secular evolution is expected to play a larger role at lower bulge masses and may be responsible for this flattening of the bulge mass - size relation , but it obviously can not affect the pure spheroid relation in any way .",
    "either dry mergers must dominate the formation of low mass ps galaxies @xcite , or another process must be taking place .",
    "our bulge and pure spheroid mass - size relations and their observed features point towards a picture in which spheroids do emerge from a hierarchical mass assembly process driven by mergers .",
    "however the amount of dissipation , i.e. , the amount of gas present in these mergers , leaves a distinctive signature on their present - day sizes and masses .",
    "using large catalogues of bulge+disc structural parameters and stellar masses for galaxies in the sdss dr7 legacy area , we quantitatively defined two subsamples of galaxy spheroids to distinctly select pure spheroids and bulges with identical properties other than bulges being embedded in disks .",
    "these two subsamples are used to study the relation between their size and stellar mass .",
    "we found that these subsamples had distinct mass - size relations , which indicates that bulges are not simply present day , pure spheroids wrapped in discs . at stellar masses above , the relations are parallel but shifted by a factor of 1.4 in size at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "bulges follow a mass - size relation consistent with a ` wet ' merger model , and the relation for pure spheroids indicates a combination of ` wet ' and ` dry ' mergers . at stellar masses below ,",
    "both relations exhibit a flattening in size with decreasing mass that is not reproduced at all by theoretical models .",
    "a comparison between our observed relations and theoretical models suggest that dissipation leaves a distinctive signature on the mass - size relations of bulges and pure spheroids .",
