    "the laminar flow through a straight pipe is linearly stable for any reynolds number [ @xcite , @xcite ] , but , as first demonstrated by @xcite , transition to turbulence usually occurs at a reynolds number @xmath2 , based on the pipe diameter and mean velocity , of around @xmath3 . by reducing the external disturbances , it is possible to achieve laminar flow up to @xmath4 [ @xcite ] when the pipe is smooth and the flow at the inlet very quiet .",
    "the reynolds number up to which it is possible to keep the flow laminar varies inversely as the level of external disturbance [ @xcite ] .",
    "although questions remain about the complete route to turbulence in a straight pipe , it seems likely that the spectrum of linear ( stable ) modes has a role to play via transient algebraic growth [ @xcite ] of disturbances .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that a nonlinear self - sustaining mechanism leads to the existence of travelling waves ( and time - periodic states ) that appear to play a key role in shear turbulence [ @xcite ] .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to examine the possible role of small local divergences in the transition process .",
    "these could have a large effect since linear stability is described by a singular perturbation problem .",
    "whearas a large amount of work has been done on the flow in significantly converging / diverging [ e.g. @xcite ] and in suddenly expanding geometries , we know of no work on the stability of _ slowly _ diverging pipe flows .",
    "sudden expansions have attracted attention because of the recirculation zone they generate . in particular , @xcite and @xcite",
    "study the length of the recirculation zone as a function of the reynolds number , and @xcite examine the oscillations of the recirculating bubble and their effect on the flow .",
    "our focus is different , as will become clear below . @xcite and @xcite , analysed the jeffery - hamel flow generated by a slowly diverging channel , and showed by linear parallel stability analysis ( the orr - sommerfeld equation ) , that the critical reynolds number decreases by a large amount even for a small divergence angle .",
    "the divergent _ pipe _ is more interesting for several reasons : the critical reynolds number is infinite for an angle of divergence of zero , the reynolds number is a decreasing function of the streamwise ( axial ) coordinate @xmath5 , and the flow non - parallelism is larger for a given divergence . in the present work ,",
    "we employ a two - pronged approach . for the mean flow",
    ", we derive an axisymmetric jeffery - hamel equation ( ajh ) , which is valid at small divergence angles . at larger angles of divergence ( @xmath6 or greater )",
    "we solve the navier - stokes equations directly in the axisymmetric geometry shown in figure [ geometry ] , with a divergent portion of finite extent . at small angles of divergence and high reynolds numbers ( above @xmath7 )",
    ", a parallel flow stability analysis is conducted on the ajh profile , while at lower reynolds numbers , the partial differential equations for non - parallel stability are solved as an extended eigenvalue problem .",

    "the following two sections describe the basic flow computations and the stability analysis respectively .",
    "we begin by noting that unlike in a divergent two - dimensional channel , no similarity flow is possible in a divergent pipe . at very low angles of divergence , however , it is possible to derive a one - parameter family of velocity profiles , where the parameter @xmath13 varies slowly in the axial coordinate @xmath5 . here",

    "a parabolic velocity profile is prescribed , while at the outlet the neumann boundary conditions : @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are imposed .",
    "the reason for using a long exit section , and the consequent increase in computational effort , is due to the requirement that the neumann condition be valid at the exit .",
    "we begin with a guess solution , where the velocity profile is parabolic at every axial location , and march in psuedo - time until a steady - state solution is obtained .",
    "the vorticity distribution at each new time step is calculated from ( [ omegaeq ] ) , adopting a first - order accurate forward differencing in time and second - order accurate central differencing in space , on a @xmath57 grid .",

    "the axial and radial velocity profiles for @xmath59 and angle of divergence @xmath12 at different downstream locations are compared with those from the ajh profiles in figure [ vel](a ) and [ vel](b ) respectively .",

    "each flow quantity is expressed as the sum of a steady mean and a time - dependent perturbation , such as @xmath65 since the flow under consideration varies significantly in the axial direction , a normal mode form may be used only in time and in the azimuthal coordinate @xmath66 . in the axial coordinate , the perturbation may be expressed as a rapidly varying wave - like part scaled by a relatively slowly varying function [ see e.g. @xcite ] , such as @xmath67 = { \\rm real } \\left\\{[u(x , r ) , v(x , r ) ,   w(x , r ) , p(x , r ) ] \\exp\\left[\\i \\left(\\int{\\alpha(x ) \\d x } + n \\theta -   \\beta_d t_d\\right ) \\right]\\right\\ } , \\label{normal_mode}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the axial , radial and the azimuthal velocity perturbations respectively , @xmath71 is the pressure perturbation , @xmath72 is a local axial wavenumber , @xmath73 is the number of waves in the azimuthal direction , and @xmath74 is the disturbance frequency .",
    "flow quantities in the form ( [ split ] ) are substituted in the navier - stokes and continuity equations , the mean flow equation is subtracted , and nonlinear terms in the perturbations are neglected . since axial variations are slow and the reynolds number is large , a consistent approximation is to retain all terms up to @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( in the critical and wall layers and elsewhere in the pipe ) and neglect higher order effects .",
