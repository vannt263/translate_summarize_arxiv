    "in order to meet the exponential growth of mobile and wireless data traffic , the fifth generation wireless systems are expected to deliver a thousand - fold higher capacity @xcite . among various potential enabling technologies to tackle such challenges , massive mimo @xcite , where the bs deploys an unprecedented number of antennas to simultaneously serve a much smaller number of users , stands out as a promising candidate because of its remarkable capability of substantially improving both the spectral and energy efficiency @xcite . as such",
    ", massive mimo technology has attracted enormous research attention from both academia and industry .",
    "the gains of massive mimo systems were initially demonstrated by assuming an ideal propagation environment . as such ,",
    "understanding the performance limits of massive mimo systems in realistic propagation environments is of paramount importance . thus far",
    ", the impact of various practical channel imperfections on the performance of massive mimo systems has been studied in literature by including line - of - sight effect @xcite , spatial correlation @xcite , pilot contamination @xcite , pilot design for channel estimation @xcite , channel estimation error @xcite , channel quantization @xcite , transceiver hardware impairments @xcite , and phase noise drift @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned channel / system imperfections , there is another important aspect of practical channel impairments known as _ channel aging _ ; this refers to the phenomenon that channel varies between when it is learned via estimation and when it is used for precoding or detection because of the random fluctuation of the propagation channel due to the relative movement between the users and the bs , as well as , the processing delay at the bs . despite its significance",
    ", very few works have investigated its impact on the performance of massive mimo systems .",
    "capitalizing on the deterministic equivalent analysis framework @xcite , the effect of inaccurate csi due to channel aging was first studied in @xcite by assuming matched filter at the bs .",
    "later on , the analysis was extended to the scenario with more sophisticated receivers , such as regularized zf precoders ( downlink ) @xcite and minimum - mean - square - error ( mmse ) receivers ( uplink ) @xcite .",
    "the analytical expressions developed in @xcite are derived by employing the deterministic equivalent approach which relies on the key assumption of large system regime , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the number of bs antennas and @xmath4 is the number of users , and they only serve as accurate approximations .",
    "hence , it is also of great interest to find tight sum rate bounds valid for arbitrary finite @xmath1 and @xmath4 , which provide an alternative perspective of quantifying the sum rate . in this regard ,",
    "we propose tractable and tight lower bounds on the achievable sum rate of the system . another major limitation of the expressions in @xcite is that they are in general too complicated to yield any useful insights into the impact of channel aging on the system performance . motivated by this",
    ", we derive simple and informative power scaling laws which shed light into how the channel aging affects the achievable rate .",
    "in addition to the multi - cell scenario considered in @xcite , the single cell scenario is also studied in detail in the current paper , mainly motivated by the following reasons : 1 ) compared to the multi - cell scenario , the single - cell scenario provides more engineering insights as reported in many prior works @xcite ; 2 ) the analytical approach developed for the asymptotic analysis of the single - cell scenario could also be applied for the multi - cell scenario ; 3 ) with a relatively large frequency reuse factor , the single cell performance can be actually attained @xcite ; 4 ) in practice , single cell massive mimo deployment has also been considered for indoor scenarios , see for instance @xcite .",
    "specifically , the main contributions of the paper are outlined as follows :    * we obtain tight lower bounds on the achievable sum - rate of single - cell uplink massive mimo systems employing mrc or zf receivers with channel aging , which are valid for arbitrary number of bs antennas @xmath1 and number of users @xmath4 , thereby enabling efficient evaluation of the achievable sum - rate in the presence of aged csi . * taking into consideration channel prediction , we derive tight lower bounds on the sum - rate of single - cell uplink massive mimo systems employing mrc and zf receivers . * for both scenarios with / without channel prediction ,",
    "we characterize the power scaling law of the system . it is shown that channel aging does not reduce the power scaling law , and using channel prediction method does not improve the power scaling law .",
    "* finally , we extend the power scaling law analysis to the single - cell downlink and multi - cell uplink scenarios .",
    "it turns out that the single - cell downlink case achieves the same power scaling law , while the multi - cell uplink scenario exhibits a different power scaling law due to the pilot contamination effect .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe the system model incorporating the combined effects of channel estimation error and channel aging .",
    "section iii presents the achievable uplink rate with aged csi for mrc and zf receivers in the single - cell uplink scenario . in section iv",
    ", the achievable uplink rate with predicted csi is studied .",
    "then , section v extends the analysis to the single - cell downlink scenario .",
    "the multi - cell scenario is considered in section vi .",
    "numerical results are provided in section vii .",

    "with mrt precoder for @xmath293 , @xmath281 , @xmath294 with @xmath295 db , and @xmath296 . ]      in this section , we examine the impact of channel aging and channel prediction on the achievable sum - rate of cellular massive mimo systems . as in @xcite , we assume @xmath297 , and @xmath298 @xmath299 for all @xmath16 @xmath300 , and consider a setting with @xmath301 cells .     for mrc receivers with aged csi for @xmath279 , @xmath281 , and @xmath106 with @xmath289 db . ]",
    "[ fig : rate_multicell_m_scaling1 ] illustrates the power scaling law of multi - cell massive mimo systems with aged csi .",
    "as expected , we see that when @xmath262 , the achievable sum - rate gradually decreases , and eventually reduces to zero as @xmath1 approaches infinity . while for @xmath302 , the achievable sum - rate converges to a deterministic non - zero value .",
    "in addition , when @xmath264 , we see that , regardless of the antenna number @xmath1 , there exists a constant gap between the two curves associated to scenarios with aged csi and current csi , respectively , elucidating the detrimental effect of channel aging . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath266 , the two curves overlap for sufficiently large @xmath1 , indicating the vanishing effect of channel aging , as indicated by ( [ eqn : qbk ] ) .     for mrc receivers with channel prediction for @xmath279 , @xmath281 , and @xmath106 with @xmath289 db . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_multicell_m_scaling ] depicts the power scaling law of multi - cell massive mimo systems with channel prediction , given by .",
    "as expected , the achievable sum - rate converges to a non - zero limit when @xmath302 , and reduces to zero when @xmath262 as the number of antennas @xmath1 increases .",
    "moreover , as the predictor order @xmath146 increases , the non - zero limit becomes larger .",
    "this paper studied the achievable sum - rate of uplink massive mimo systems taking into account the channel aging effect .",
    "specifically , we derived tractable lower bounds of the sum - rate for both mrc and zf receivers with / without channel prediction , which are valid for arbitrary number of antennas and users .",
    "in addition , we characterized the impact of channel aging effect and channel prediction on the power scaling law .",
    "the findings of the paper suggest that aged csi degrades the corresponding achievable sum - rate , and the more severe the channel aging effect , the more significant reduction of the sum - rate .",
    "moreover , channel prediction enhances the sum - rate , and the higher the predictor order , the better the sum - rate performance .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the benefits due to channel prediction are more pronounced in the scenario , where the channel aging effect is not severe .",
    "finally , it was found that both in the single - cell and the multi - cell scenario , the transmit power of each user can be scaled down at most by @xmath0 in the presence of channel aging , which indicates that aged csi does not degrade the power scaling law , and channel prediction does not improve the power scaling law .",
    "similarly , the single - cell downlink scenario analysis was presented , which concludes that in the single - cell downlink scenario , the same power scaling law @xmath0 is achieved as in the single - cell uplink scenario .",
    "however , unlike the single - cell scenario , the achievable rate in the multi - cell scenario converges to a non - zero limit when each user does not cut down the transmit power by the maximum limit , i.e. , @xmath105 with @xmath303 , due to the effect of pilot contamination .",
