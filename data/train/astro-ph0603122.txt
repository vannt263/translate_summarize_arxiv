    "from time to time in science there are paradigm - shifting developments that occur at such a rapid pace that it is recognized that an important new subfield of science has emerged .",
    "such is the case for the study of gravitationally bound companions to minor bodies in the solar system , a group of objects that can be referred to as _ binary minor planets _ , or , more simply , _ binaries_. the broad term _ binary _ used in this context often includes objects that would normally be considered satellites because of the large mass ratio of primary to secondary , others that are true binaries or doubles where the mass ratio of primary to secondary is closer to one , and contact binaries and bilobate objects .",
    "systems consisting of more than two gravitationally bound objects can also exist and one such system has now been observed ( marchis et al .",
    "2005a ) .    for the lingustic purists , it is worth noting that the term _ binary _ is frequently used to refer to gravitationally bound minor planets regardless of the mutual size of the components .",
    "if one cared to do so , a _ true _ binary could be defined as a system where the barycenter resides outside of either of the two gravitationally bound bodies . by this definition , pluto and charon",
    "qualify as the first known solar system binary ( not counting the sun - jupiter binary ) .",
    "the requirement for meeting this definition can be expressed as @xmath0 where a is the semimajor axis of the system , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the masses of the two components , and @xmath3 is the radius of the primary which can be expressed in terms of the primary mass and density as @xmath4 . in practice , however , many systems will not have measured radii or known densities and albedos and thus the location of the barycenter relative to the surfaces will be uncertain . as with many other instances of taxonomical terminology , however , the precise use of the term _ binary _ is less important than is a detailed knowledge of the objects in question . in this review",
    "i will use the term _ binary _ in the broadest sense to include both true binaries and related classes of objects found among the minor body populations of the solar system .",
    "the two - century - long history of searches for and eventual discovery of binary minor planets has been summarized in several earlier reviews , most recently and most thoroughly by merline et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and by richardson & walsh ( 2005 ) .",

    "all of the binary populations have most objects within a similar small fraction of the hill radius .",
    "the main difference between populations is the large number of objects in the kuiper belt with large size ratios .",
    "the lack of tnbs with small secondary to primary size ratios is heavily influenced by observing bias and the number of such systems remains to be determined .",
    "it is clear that large primary to secondary ratio systems are rare in the main belt and among neas . ]",
    "[ fig : hill ]",
    "an important area of investigation is the effort to understand when , how , and under what conditions binaries and multiples are formed and how long they are able to survive",
    ". theoretical work to date has identified three main formation mechanisms : capture , collisions , and rotational fission .",
    "currently , the leading models for binary formation differ for each of the major populations .",
    "richardson & walsh ( 2005 ) have thoroughly reviewed this topic and i include here only a few of the most salient points .",
    "tnbs have had the greatest variety of models proposed for their formation .",
    "stern ( 2002 ) proposed a collisional model but noted that the then assumed fraction of 1% binaries could not be met unless he assumed that the mean albedo was higher than the formerly assumed value of @xmath6 adopted from comet halley .",
    "while it is now apparent that albedos of many tnos are indeed higher than 4% , the collisional model can not produce the much higher fraction of binaries that are now being found .",
    "a collision model has also been proposed for the pluto / charon binary ( canup  2005 ) but stochastic models such as this have little applicability to larger populations of binaries .",
    "capture models have evolved in complexity with the most recent work by astakhov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) using chaos - assisted capture giving a reasonable distribution of orbital parameters compared to the observed sample . the hybrid collision - exchange capture model of funato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) can now be ruled out because the eccentricity of observed orbits does not meet the predictions of this model .    in the main belt , collisions appear to be the dominant mode of forming binaries .",
    "the evidence for this is the small secondary to primary size ratio for most of the objects ( table  [ tab : mbb ] ) and the apparent higher incidence of binaries in collision families ( merline et al .",
    "numerical models of formation of binaries ( e.g.  durda et al .",
    "2004 ) identify two main classes of post - collision binaries : fragments that are captured or reaccreted around a remnant primary and pairs ( or more ) of fragments that are mutually captured .",
    "nea binaries are distinctive in the rapid rotation of the primaries , typically less than 3 hours ( pravec et al",
    ".  2005a ) .",
    "this is taken to be an indication that these objects may have formed through spin - up ( from the yorp effect or collisions ) and subsequent fission .",
    "the role of tidal forces during close encounters with earth and mars has usually been assumed ( richardson et al .",
    "1998 , walsh & richardson 2005 ) .",
    "however , the recent evidence for a similarly large fraction of binaries among rapidly - rotating small asteroids populations in the main belt opens the question of whether nea binaries are formed in the main belt and survive the orbital perturbations that bring them into nea orbits or whether binaries are efficiently formed during the relatively brief 10  myr mean lifetime of neas .",
    "survival of binaries , once they are formed , is an important , and so far largely - neglected question .",
    "petit & mousis ( 2004 ) have investigated the survival of tnbs and have found that some of the most widely separated may have lifetimes shorter than the age of the solar system .",
    "if this is correct , the initial inventory of binaries may have been even higher than the already high fraction we see today .",
    "an important question , in addition to lifetime against collisional erosion , is the survival of binaries during scattering events .",
    "the fact that most binaries orbit within 10% of the hill radius or less ( figure  [ fig : hill ] ) , regardless of population , may be the signature of tidal disruption of the most loosely bound systems .    given the large size range and potentially different histories of these populations , the variety of formation mechanisms may not entirely surprising , but from an aesthetic point of view , it is clearly less than satisfactory . a question for the future is whether or not there are underlying and unifying modes for formation that apply across all the classes of minor bodies in the solar system . at present",
    ", collisions appear to be the most universal component of any such model , even if , in some cases , they are only part of the formation scenario . the apparent prevalence of binaries in the kuiper belt raises the possibility that bound systems are commonplace in accreting dust disks and that further evolution is dominated by the destruction ( or lack thereof ) of preexisting binaries .",
    "the most promising case for consolidation is for nea binaries which may turn out to be survivors of a preexisting binary population in the main belt .",
    "the main belt asteroid ( 87 ) sylvia has now been confirmed as the first known minor planet triple ( marchis et al .  2005a , b ) .",
    "the discovery of triples was not entirely unexpected as numerical simulations of collisions produce triples and higher multiples as well as binaries , at least in the early post - collision time scale ( leinhardt & richardson 2005 ) . stability of multiples is an important issue that will have to be addressed , but as demonstrated by the existence of stellar triples and higher - order multiples , stable configurations can be found . ultimately , the incidence of triples relative to binaries may help constrain models of formation , especially collisional models .",
    "no multiples have been identified among neas or tnos as of mid - october 2005 .",
    "however ,  has been proposed as a potential triple as a way of understanding the apparent low density derived from spitzer observations ( margot et al .",
    "2005 , stansberry et al .  2005 ) .",
    "interestingly , an unexplained large change in brightness on one night has been reported for this object ( ivanova et al .",
    "further monitoring of the lightcurve is called for .",
    "the tno  also has reported large variations in one of the two components ( noll et al .",
    "2004 , margot et al .",
    "this may be the signature of a close binary or contact system , or may simply represent large albedo and shape effects .",
    "the largest tnos have larger hill radii ( for objects of the same density r@xmath7 scales with the radius of the primary ) and a larger fraction of their hill spheres are searchable with instruments of a given resolution .",
    "stern ( 2003 ) reviewed searches for additional satellites of pluto and prospects for improved searches using the hubble space telescope and the new horizons spacecraft . with a high fraction of pluto - sized objects",
    "now known to have one satellite , it seems more likely that multiples will eventually be found .",
    "the discovery of numerous binary systems has stimulated creative and unconventional thinking .",
    "uk & burns ( 2005 ) propose a variant of the yorp effect which would apply to binaries .",
    "for neas , which are small enough and close enough to the sun to be affected , this effect can explain the nearly circular and synchronous orbits of secondaries .",
    "the timescale for orbital evolution under the byorp effect is surprisingly short , generally less than 10@xmath8 years .",
    "because of the short evolutional time scale , uk and burns speculate that most nea binaries may be in stable states where yorp and byorp cancel and are small .",
    "this prediction is testable with accurate observations of orbital elements for nea binary pairs , a test that should be possible within the next five years . on a much grander scale ,",
    "cintala et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest an `` experiment '' aimed at deorbiting a binary companion with multiple explosive charges .",
    "they list candidates in order of @xmath9 needed to deorbit the secondary and crash it into the primary .",
    "the authors identified 2000  ug@xmath10 as the best candidate with a 230 m diameter primary and a 140 m secondary orbiting with a semimajor axis of 410 m.    comet nuclei are thought to originate from the same pool of primordial bodies that populate the outer solar system and are thus likely to share a similar propensity for binaries .",
    "study of comet nuclei is a notoriously difficult problem because of the small size of the objects and because of the persistent presence of coma , even at large heliocentric distances .",
    "disruption of comet nuclei is observed , with perhaps the best known example being comet shoemaker - levy 9 ( c.f .",
    "weaver et al .",
    "there are , however , no conclusive observations of a gravitationally bound cometary binary .",
    "marchis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) speculated that some aspects of comet hale - bopp might be more easily explained if that object were a bound binary , but this was not a unique interpretation .",
    "it seems likely , however , that some fraction of comets , particularly  new \" oort - cloud comets could be binary systems .",
    "observations of nuclei at large heliocentric distances with high - angular resolution could address this question .",
    "the immediate future of the study of binaries in minor planets is very promising .",
    "discovery will continue , probably at an increased pace , due both to the heightened awareness of the existence and detectability of these bodies and to the availability of instrumentation capable of finding faint companions at small separations .",
    "binaries will continue to provide critical physical data that is not obtainable in other way .",
    "the growing number of detected binaries will enable the nascent study of binaries fraction as a function of dynamical history , composition , size , rotation rate , and other conceivable correlations .",
    "there are many possible avenues of investigation . among the most promising are apparently high fraction of binaries in the dynamically unperturbed classical kuiper belt ( stephens & noll 2005 ) and the apparently high fraction of binaries in some main belt collisional families ( merline et al .",
    "2005 ) because both have the potential to yield clues on the origin and survival of binaries .",
    "we have now reached the point where it is possible to state that binaries must be a common feature in the evolution of protoplanetary disks like the one that formed our solar system .",
    "debris disks that we now observe around other stars probably share an affinity for forming pairs .",
    "it remains to be seen if the great utility of binaries as mass - measuring tools and in teasing out the early history of the solar system will result in insights that extend beyond to inform our understanding of planetary systems in general . if nothing else , however , the triumph of the detection and utilization of minor planet binaries must stand as an object lesson in the value of persistence and as an especially poignant reminder of the unexpected complexity of planetary systems",
    "in a rapidly developing field such as this , online compilations are invaluable resources for researchers and students .",
    "while online resources are typically not referenceable , because of their ephemeral nature , it is worth mentioning several resources that are currently available . a comprehensive compilation of solar system binaries is regularly updated by w.  r.  johnston at his website http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/asteroidmoons.html .",
    "the ondrejov asteroid photometry project led by petr pravec maintains an online resource at http://sunkl.asu.cas.cz/@xmath11ppravec/ that includes prepublication data and an updated list of binary neas .",
    "joel parker maintains the distant ekos ( edgeworth - kuiper belt objects ) web pages that include a compilation of transneptunian binaries .",
    "franck marchis has an extensive online collection of binary asteroid orbital information , much of which has not been published at the time of this review .",
    "updated information is available at http://astron.berkeley.edu/@xmath11fmarchis/ and was used in the tables in this review ; references , however , were to published materials .",
    "i would like to acknowledge ongoing and productive collaborations with my colleagues , particularly w.  grundy , d.  stephens , d.  osip , j.  spencer , and m.  buie .",
    "a tip of the hat also to a.  storrs and b.  zellner , early collaborators who helped me appreciate the excitement of objects smaller than saturn .",
    "a special note of thanks goes to a.  lubenow who was the key enabler for complex solar system programs on the hubble space telescope for two decades and who did so with his unique mixture of deep technical expertise and intolerance for nonsense .",
    "this work was supported in part by grant go 10514 from the space telescope science institute which is operated by aura under contract from nasa .",

    "<S> the discovery of binaries in each of the major populations of minor bodies in the solar system is propelling a rapid growth of heretofore unattainable physical information . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of mass and density constraints for minor bodies opens the door to studies of internal structure , comparisons with meteorite samples , and correlations between bulk- physical and surface - spectral properties . </S>",
    "<S> the number of known binaries is now more than 70 and is growing rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> a smaller number have had the extensive followup observations needed to derive mass and albedo information , but this list is growing as well . </S>",
    "<S> it will soon be the case that we will know more about the physical parameters of objects in the kuiper belt than has been known about asteroids in the main belt for the last 200 years . </S>",
    "<S> another important aspect of binaries is understanding the mechanisms that lead to their formation and survival . </S>",
    "<S> the relative sizes and separations of binaries in the different minor body populations point to more than one mechanism for forming bound pairs . </S>",
    "<S> collisions appear to play a major role in the main belt . </S>",
    "<S> rotational and/or tidal fission may be important in the near earth population . </S>",
    "<S> for the kuiper belt , capture in multi - body interactions may be the preferred formation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of these conclusions remain tentative and limited by observational and theoretical incompleteness . </S>",
    "<S> observational techniques for identifying binaries are equally varied . </S>",
    "<S> high angular resolution observations from space and from the ground are critical for detection of the relatively distant binaries in the main belt and the kuiper belt . </S>",
    "<S> radar has been the most productive method for detection of near earth binaries . </S>",
    "<S> lightcurve analysis is an independent technique that is capable of exploring phase space inaccessible to direct observations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , spacecraft flybys have played a crucial paradigm - changing role with discoveries that unlocked this now - burgeoning field . </S>"
