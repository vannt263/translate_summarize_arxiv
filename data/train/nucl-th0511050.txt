    "the prediction that atomic nuclei can possess stable low - lying configurations with the tetrahedral symmetry has been confirmed by several independent calculations using a variety of nuclear mean - fields@xcite .",
    "however , no experimental evidence has been reported so far , which can be put down to the lack of understanding of the excitation mechanisms in such exotic systems .",
    "we investigate here the collective rotation , since the deep minima and large barriers reported e.g.in ref.@xcite suggest tetrahedral nuclei may be amenable to sustain rotational bands . this article is a sequel to previous works where the structure and moments of inertia of tetrahedral collective bands were analyzed@xcite , and the consequences of the collective rotation in terms of symmetries and quantum numbers were discussed@xcite . to complement these studies , we wish to focus here on the stability of the tetrahedral minimum as a function of the rotational frequency , which is one of the pre - requisites to an eventual observation of rotational bands .",
    "today there exists several articles in the literature about the nuclear tetrahedral symmetry ( associated to the point group of symmetry @xmath0 ) and we refer the reader interested in a general introduction to this subject to e.g.  ref.@xcite . for the purpose of the present study , it suffices to recall that a nucleus with a non - axial @xmath1 octupole deformation ( in the standard expansion of the nuclear radius on the basis of spherical harmonics , with deformation parameters @xmath2 ) has all the symmetries of a regular tetrahedron .",
    "although other realizations of the group @xmath0 , involving higher - order multipole terms with @xmath3 , also appear to generate stable minima in the potential energy landscape@xcite , they will not be considered in this article .",
    "the cranking model was the subject of several comprehensive review articles and we refer to refs.@xcite for a general discussion of its main features .",
    "we just recall here how the model should be adapted in the 3-dimensional case : the rotation is described with the help of 3 lagrange multipliers @xmath4 which are interpreted as the classical rotational frequencies along the x- , y- and z - axis of the body - fixed frame respectively .",
    "equivalently , one can choose the spherical representation in which the rotational frequency vector @xmath5 is parameterized by @xmath6 .",
    "it is known that a collective rotation of a nucleus with prolate or oblate deformation takes place about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis . however , in the case of a nuclear shape with the @xmath0 symmetry , the quadrupole deformation is equal to zero , and consequently no simple criterion exists to determine the sorientation of the rotation axis .    a possible procedure to find optimum rotation axis consists in computing the total energy as a function of the orientation of the rotation axis , characterized by the two angles @xmath7 , for different rotational frequencies @xmath8 , as was done in refs.@xcite .",
    "one thus obtains two - dimensional maps whose minima signal the energetically - favored axes of rotation .",
    "these calculations were performed using a macroscopic - microscopic technique , in which the total energy is the sum of a liquid - drop contribution parameterized as in ref.@xcite and shell - correction extracted from a woods - saxon potential with the form defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results@xcite suggest that at low rotational frequencies ( up to @xmath9 mev/@xmath10 ) , no particular axis of rotation is favored , while at higher frequencies , several well - defined minima emerge",
    ". however , these calculations assumed a fixed tetrahedral deformation and did not include pairing correlations : therefore , in the present study we want to see whether the tetrahedral minimum survives the increase of angular momentum .",
    "in order to study the stability of the tetrahedral minimum and to treat on the same footing the response of the nuclear system to rotation and pairing correlations , we performed the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations in the current implementation of the code hfodd ( v2.17k)@xcite for @xmath11zr , which shows@xcite a pronounced tetrahedral minimum at @xmath12 . in our calculations",
    "we employed the sly4@xcite skyrme force in the particle - hole channel and the density - dependent delta interaction in the particle - particle channel , whose intensity was fitted so as to reproduce the trend of experimental pairing gaps in the neutron - rich zr isotopes , see ref.@xcite for details .",
    "the calculations were performed for two families of rotation axes : ( i ) the axis passing through the middle of the edge of the tetrahedron , ( ii ) the axis passing through the tip of the tetrahedron .",
    "they will be referred hereafter as to edge and tip axes , respectively .",
    "these two axes are given a particular attention as they are symmetry axes of the rotating tetrahedron ; a 4-fold axis with inversion ( edge ) and a 3-fold axis ( tip ) , i.e. these symmetries commute with the cranking hamiltonian .",
    "for the edge and tip axes , we performed the constrained hfb calculations . in the case of the edge axis we requested that the discrete antilinear @xmath13-simplexes , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , be conserved .",
    "( we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of the discrete symmetries implemented in the code hfodd ) .",
    "this was equivalent to conserving the @xmath16-signature symmetry , @xmath17 .",
    "they were supplemented by full symmetry - unconstrained calculations , which was the only option available for the rotation about the tip axis . in the latter case",
    ", we also used the option to readjust the orientation of the rotation axis self - consistently in the course of the iterations .",
    "we did not notice ( i ) any change in the orientation of @xmath5 fixed at the beginning of the iterations , at least up to the first single - particle crossing , ( ii ) any significative difference in energy between the various orientations of @xmath5 and between the symmetry - constrained and symmetry - unconstrained case .",
    "this confirms a spherical - like behaviour of the rotating tetrahedron as claimed in ref.@xcite .      with the standard choice of the spherical harmonics for the calculation of the multipole moments , the edge - axis coincides with the z - axis of the body - fixed frame@xcite .",
    "the deformations @xmath2 extracted from the multipole moments can be plotted directly , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "the curve with plain circles shows the `` tetrahedral '' deformation @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noticing that it is nearly constant as function of @xmath8 , thus proving the resilience of the tetrahedral symmetry to the rotation .    in the case of the tip - axis",
    ", we chose to first perform a rotation of the nucleus at rest by the euler angles @xmath18 in such a way that the new tip - axis coincides with the z - axis of the reference frame .",
    "this corresponds to an angle @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the multipole moments @xmath22 must be transformed according to the general relation : @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are the wigner matrices . in our case ,",
    "the initial deformation was characterized by @xmath25 and all other moments were null .",
    "after the rotation , only @xmath26 and @xmath27 are different from zero , and they are related by : @xmath28",
    ". we report in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] the equivalent @xmath29 and @xmath30 deformations as function of the rotational frequency , together with the value of @xmath30 in the exact symmetry limit .",
    "the little deviation from the exact symmetry case seems to increase slightly with @xmath8 although remaining very small .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the rotation of tetrahedral nuclei using a fully - microscopic 3-dimensional cranking model .",
    "the results of self - consistent skyrme hartree - fock bogoliubov calculations show that the tetrahedral minimum remains as function of the rotational frequency and that practically no quadrupole polarization remains .",
    "the latter observation implies strongly hindered stretched-@xmath31 transitions for the eventual rotational bands .",
    "this work was supported in part by the exchange programme between in2p3 ( france ) and polish nuclear physics laboratories , by the polish committee for scientific research ( kbn ) under contract no .  1  p03b  059  27 and by the foundation for polish science ( fnp )"
