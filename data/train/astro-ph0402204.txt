    "this would cause optical line emission from the cooler gas and locally enhance the x  ray emission .",
    "the two phases should consequently display spatial similarities .",
    "cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) pointed out that if temperature gradients are sufficiently high , classical electron conduction ( spitzer 1962 ) overestimates the actual energy flux .",

    "the x  ray filaments and optical filaments appear marginally resolved , although since we may be viewing sheets or ribbons , the interface length scale could be smaller . for reference , we adopt a length scale of @xmath33  pc at 20  arcsec radius , and assume it is inversely proportional to radius .",

    "we conclude that , given the uncertainties , saturated electron conduction could be providing the power to the optical filament systems .",
    "if the energy loss from the ( optical / uv / ir ) filament system does represent the heat being drained from the coronal phase , then it is energetically significant , overwhelming the losses due to x ",
    "rays at least locally .",
    "the energy flow rather than the total energy content dominates in this scenario , and radiation governs the ultimate loss of energy , primarily in the optical and infrared regions .",
    "the consequent cooling of the cluster core will enhance its x  ray emissivity as the density increases to maintain pressure equilibrium .",
    "the essential features of a `` cool core cluster '' ( or cooling - flow cluster ) are hence induced .",
    "there are of course caveats to this interpretation .",
    "topology , projection effects , magnetic fields and details of the interface impose large uncertainties on the available energy .",
    "if the cool gas is significantly in the foreground or background , then the available energy can be much less .",
    "if magnetic fields shield the filaments , the heat may not be able to flow into the filaments .",
    "evaporating and condensing clouds in the presence of radiation and conduction have been studied by mckee & cowie ( 1977 ) and begelman & mckee ( 1990 ) , ( though we note that mckee & cowie 1977 eliminate the important thermally stable @xmath1  k phase from their analysis ) . in reality , the details of timescales , dynamical motions and inner and outer boundary conditions will all enter into a correct description of the physics of these complex regions , and it may well be that other transport processes are equally , or more , effective than electron conduction .",
    "we accept that there may indeed be other viable interpretations of the data .",
    "if indeed , it can be shown that the optical filaments are powered by a mechanism other than energy flow from the hot plasma , then we may infer that conduction would have to be suppressed since it represents a significant energy source .",
    "however , to counterbalance this , we note that the models presented above , derived from properties of the _ coronal x  ray gas _ , give acceptable agreement to the _ optical _",
    "@xmath17 data , without adjustment of free parameters .",

    "( 2003 ) draw attention to the similarity of the perseus filaments to a rising spherical cap bubble , which has an analogue in m87 : the eastern low - frequency ( intermediate ) radio lobe is interacting with the halo x  ray emitting gas , and drawing it out from the center ( churazov et  al .",
    "sparks et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed evidence ( from the velocity field plus absorption due to dust ) that the innermost optical filaments of m87 are flowing out in the vicinity of the jet .",
    "hence it may be that in such systems , the large and rapid energy release associated with the triggering of an agn is providing , in a general sense , heating and an outflow in the central regions of the clusters , and that in both virgo and perseus the optical and x  ray filaments towards the center are expanding away from the nucleus , and not infalling .",
    "the outer filaments , by contrast , do appear to be infalling , and it is reasonable to speculate that the agn activity was triggered by the same infall or merger event that is interacting with the x  ray halo . since we are dealing in concept with fundamental physical and transport processes , if valid here , then this conclusion must have wide validity .",
    "given the dynamic and violent nature of cluster centers  regions that are influenced by mergers , active nuclei and energy transport processes  we suggest that the cool - core phenomenon is transient and merger induced .",
    "it is unlikely we are witnessing a steady - state even in the x  rays .",
    "if merger events have triggered nuclear activity , and if strong thermal interactions arise between hot and cold gas , then a logical consequence is that prominent x  ray peaks of cool - core galaxy clusters are themselves transient and only intermittently present as the stochastic evolution and assembly of galaxy clusters proceeds .",
    "our primary goal has been to present a very deep x  ray image of the center of the virgo cluster , and to stress an important empirical observation , namely that warm gas with @xmath46  k emitting strong optical line emission is strikingly similar to a phase which is a thousand times hotter and radiates at x  ray wavelengths .",
    "this correlation may be offering important clues to the nature of transport processes in the cluster interstellar medium , since it implies that two dramatically distinct phases , close in space , `` know about one another '' and are in some form of thermal communication .",
    "x  ray spectral analysis shows that the hot phase itself has two temperature components , and that the lower of these is more prevelant in the vicinity of the optical filaments .",
    "we build on these observations to show , quantitatively , that electron conduction ( possibly saturated ) can provide the energy seen in the form of emission line radiation in these and other optical filaments .",
    "we do not claim that this is the _ only _ viable model .",
    "there are important uncertainties particularly with regard to magnetic field structures and strengths , and conduction would have to proceed at or close to spitzer or saturated levels at least in one direction .",
    "nevertheless , the model appears promising and offers an acceptable _ quantitative _ relationship between @xmath0  k coronal and @xmath1  k plasma properties .",
    "if the material of the filaments has an external merger origin , then other ancillary properties such as their dustiness have a natural explanation .",
