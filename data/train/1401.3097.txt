    "the effect is enhanced in cluster sectors adjacent to low - density regions of the surrounding environment , as it seems to be confirmed by the significant azimuthal variations found in the aforementioned clusters .",

    "this functional form fits the data well outside @xmath35 , adding support to the suggestion that the flattening and downturn of the icp entropy can be the result of the weakened accretion .",
    "the authors have also shown that the gas clumping calculated in the numerical simulations of nagai & lau ( 2011 ) is insufficient to reproduce the observed flattening and turnover of the entropy . moreover , they have shown that a temperature decline much shallower than observed is necessary in the outskirts to reproduce a power law increase of the entropy @xmath36 , even using the gas density profiles from _",

    "this analysis exploits the possibility of easily obtaining the gas density profile from the x - ray surface brightness in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) where the temperature dependence is negligible in a hot cluster , and then use it to obtain the icp temperature from the sz data .",
    "this avoids the difficulty of measuring high - quality x - ray spectra ( see cavaliere et al .",
    "2005 ) . of course , any bias in the x - ray profile reflects immediately on the temperature determination .",
    "for example , the eventual presence of gas clumping implies a steeper decline in the temperature profile obtained by the x - ray / sz joint analysis .",
    "this method has been used by eckert et al . ( 2013a ) to challenge the entropy flattening reported in the _ suzaku _ x - ray analysis of several clusters ( see walker et al .",

    "steep temperature and flat entropy profiles have been observed by _ suzaku _ toward the virial radius in some relaxed cc clusters , and in the undisturbed directions of ncc clusters ( like coma ) .",
    "these findings can be interpreted in terms of a reduced entropy production relative to a pure gravitational inflow .",
