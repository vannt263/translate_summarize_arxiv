    "classical random walks on form the basis for many successful physics - inspired algorithms . the evolution of probability distributions according to simple update rules for probability spreading",
    "allows us to sample from thermal distributions ( via the metropolis algorithm @xcite ) or to look for ground - states of physical systems(with simulated annealing @xcite ) .",
    "the effectiveness of random - walk based algorithms can be characterized by its mixing time ( how fast it approaches the stationary distribution ) , or by a hitting time ( how fast it reaches a particular vertex ) . for example , the fast mixing of a random walk algorithm for sampling from the thermal distribution of the ising model @xcite forms the basis of a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for the permanent of a matrix @xcite .",
    "thinking about how to utilize the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics , instead of analyzing the diffusion of probabilities , we can ask what happens if we let the amplitudes in a system whose interactions respect some graph structure evolve according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the result of this way of thought are _ quantum walks _",
    "@xcite , a useful tool in quantum computation .",
    "they bring new dynamics ( different wavepacket spreading @xcite ) and algorithmic applications ( e.g. in searching for graph properties @xcite , graph traversal @xcite , game evaluation @xcite ) as well as theoretical results ( universality for computation @xcite ) .",
    "we can define quantum walks in discrete time with an additional coin register , or in continuous time , with hamiltonians which are adjacency matrices of graphs . in this paper , we choose the latter approach .",
    "the mixing of quantum walks has been previously investigated for several types of graphs ",
    "e.g. on a chain @xcite , a 2d lattice @xcite , hypercubes @xcite and circulant graphs @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on continuous quantum walks on _ necklaces _  cyclic graphs composed from many ( @xmath0 ) copies of a subgraph of size @xmath1 ( pearls ) , as depicted in fig.[figurenecklaces ] .",
    "our goal is to provide a simplified approach for finding their eigenvectors and eigenvalues , as well as for analyzing the mixing times for such walks .    the motivation for analyzing this type of graph comes from hamiltonian complexity @xcite .",
    "quantum computation in the usual circuit model @xcite can be translated into a quantum walk in two ways .",
    "first , following childs @xcite , evolving a wavepacket on a graph with many wires ( representing basis states ) , connected according to the desired quantum circuit .",
    "second , we can use feynman s idea @xcite to view a computation as a `` pointer '' particle doing a quantum walk ( hopping ) in a `` clock '' register , while the computation gets done in a `` data '' register @xcite or particles holding the working data hopping along a graph @xcite . in both cases , we need to look at transmission / reflection properties of the graphs , and their long - term dynamics . specifically",
    ", we would like to know ( and ensure ) that a computation is done when we want it to be , not having the wavepacket localized ( or spread ) in undesired parts of the graph .",
    "this is why we focus on the mixing properties of quantum walks that are underlying quantum computational models based on quantum walks , looking at their spectra in detail .",
    "note that proofs of computational complexity for qma - hard problems ( e.g. @xcite ) also involves investigating the ( low - lying ) spectrum of a quantum walk .",
    "the simplest graph involved in the feynman - like models is a line or a cycle , and the dynamics for this quantum walk are well understood @xcite .",
    "we look at continuous - time quantum walks on _ necklace _ graphs , which appear in the analysis of quantum computational models @xcite that generalize the feynman approach .",
    "necklace graphs could also be viewed as implementing dynamics for quantum walks on imperfect cycles .    utilizing the cyclic structure of the necklaces , we propose a bloch - type ansatz for the eigenfunctions , allowing us to obtain several results .",
    "first , in section [ sec : ansatz ] we reduce the problem of finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the quantum walk on a necklace of @xmath0 pearls of size @xmath1 to diagonalizing a @xmath2 matrix @xmath0 times ( compared to full @xmath3 diagonalization .",
    "second , in section [ sec : mixing ] , we analyze average - time mixing for quantum walks on necklaces and find a general method for showing convergence to the limiting distribution . finally , in section [ sec : examples ] , we work out examples of quantum walks on particular necklaces , giving analytic ( and numerical ) results for the eigenvectors , eigenvalues and the scaling of the mixing time , concluding with open questions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "consider a quantum system with a hamiltonian @xmath4 given by the adjacency matrix of a necklace - like structure .",
    "the simplest necklace is a cycle with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "a  general necklace is a collection of @xmath0 pearls ( small identical graphs with @xmath1 nodes ) , connected into a cycle as in fig .",
    "[ figurenecklaces ] .",
    "we label points in the @xmath5-th pearl @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the endpoints of the @xmath5-th pearl ( connected to the previous and following pearls ) are @xmath8 and @xmath9 let @xmath10 be the adjacency matrix of a pearl .",
    "the hamiltonian for the whole necklace is a sum of intra - pearl terms and the connections between them : @xmath11    our goal is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath4 .",
    "because of the underlying cyclic structure of a general necklace graph with @xmath0 pearls , we can assume that its eigenvectors will have a structure related to a plane wave on a cycle with @xmath0 nodes .",
    "let us then look at the @xmath0-node cycle first . there",
    "the hamiltonian has no @xmath12 s in it , allowing us to find the ( plane - wave ) eigenvectors of @xmath13 : @xmath14 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath15 parametrized by momenta @xmath16 : @xmath17 for @xmath18 .     and",
    "@xmath19.,width=249 ]    consider now a general necklace with @xmath0 pearls .",
    "we expect the eigenvectors of the necklace hamiltonian to have a form resembling , also depending on the momenta @xmath16 .",
    "let us thus look for the eigenvectors of @xmath4 in the form @xmath20 where each @xmath21 is a normalized vector with support only on the @xmath5-th pearl ( the vertices @xmath22 ) . using and",
    ", we obtain @xmath23 where the last two terms correspond to the amplitudes on the endpoints of the @xmath5-th pearl coming from the endpoints of the neighboring pearls . notice that because of our parametrization",
    ", the hamiltonian is now block - diagonalized , acting in the same way on each pearl ( see figure [ figurenecklacepb ] ) .",
    "when @xmath24 is an eigenvector of @xmath4 , we also have @xmath25 using and , finding the eigenvalues of @xmath4 thus reduces to diagonalizing the @xmath2 matrix @xmath26 where @xmath10 is the adjacency matrix of a pearl , and @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has only two non - zero elements in the corners if a pearl has two distinct roots @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "there is a special case when a pearl is connected to the rest of the necklace through a single root vertex @xmath28 .",
    "there , the matrix @xmath30 has a single nonzero element and reads @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] diagonalizing gives us @xmath1-dimensional vectors @xmath32 . for each @xmath33",
    ", there will be @xmath1 of these , and we will label them @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath36 of @xmath37 are also the eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , to find all the @xmath38 eigenvalues @xmath36 of the necklace hamiltonian with @xmath0 pearls , we need to diagonalize the @xmath2 matrix @xmath37 for each @xmath33 . to get the eigenvectors of @xmath4 from the eigenvectors of @xmath37 , we plug the coefficients @xmath39 of the vectors we just found into and .    in conclusion , the ansatz simplifies the general problem of diagonalizing the @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 to diagonalizing an @xmath2 matrix @xmath0 times .",
    "this is useful especially when @xmath1 is small and @xmath0 is large .",
    "our focus in what follows will be on mixing of continuous quantum walks on many - pearled ( large-@xmath0 ) necklaces .",
    "time evolution according to the schrdinger equation with a hamiltonian that is an adjacency matrix of a graph produces a continuous time quantum walk .",
    "let the eigenvectors of the system be @xmath40 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath15 .",
    "when starting from an initial state @xmath41 , the probability of finding the `` walker '' at vertex @xmath42 at time @xmath43 ( measuring position @xmath44 ) is @xmath45 the evolution is unitary , so it does not mix towards a time - independent stationary distribution like a classical markov process . on the other hand , we can think about mixing for a quantum walk in a time - averaged sense , investigating a time - averaged probability distribution .",
    "it holds information about the probability of finding the system at a particular vertex at time @xmath43 , chosen uniformly at random between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( a chosen limiting time ) : @xmath48 this time - averaged probability has a well - defined @xmath49 limit , which gives us the _ limiting probability distribution _ , expressible using the eigenvectors of @xmath4 as : @xmath50 where the final sum goes over pairs of equal eigenvalues .",
    "note that for some quantum walks this limiting distribution can be dependent on the initial state ( e.g. when we start in some eigenstate ) , so we will keep the superscript @xmath51 around .    to determine how fast the time - averaged probability converges towards the limiting distribution , we need to bound the total distribution distance @xmath52 .",
    "using , integrating an exponential and realizing that the terms summed over pairs of equal eigenvalues subtract out , we arrive at @xmath53 where the sum now goes over pairs of eigenvalues that are not equal .",
    "we can put an upper bound on this expression by a technique similar to @xcite .",
    "first , we use @xmath54 and move the absolute value inside the sums , to obtain @xmath55 the cauchy - schwartz inequality @xmath56 allows us to perform the sum over @xmath44 , resulting in @xmath57 after another use of the cauchy - schwartz inequality on the terms involving @xmath41 , realizing the expression is symmetric under exchange of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we finally obtain @xmath60 which corresponds to lemma 4.3 of @xcite .",
    "it involves a sum of the inverse of eigenvalue differences .",
    "these terms can be large , but as @xmath47 grows , the @xmath61 factor can bring the total variation difference to zero .",
    "it is our task now to investigate how fast this happens .",
    "we seek @xmath62 ( the _ mixing time _ ) , for which @xmath63 would hold for all @xmath64 , given any precision parameter @xmath65 .      for our first example",
    ", we now follow @xcite and compute the limiting distribution for the case of a walk on a cycle . later",
    ", we will show that the time - averaged probability converges to it for times @xmath66 , using a more general mixing result proved in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the continuous - time quantum walk on a cycle are given by and .",
    "we obtain the limiting distribution from by summing over the few nonzero terms .",
    "the sum over the equal eigenvalues splits into a sum over @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( degenerate eigenvalue pairs ) .",
    "when the initial state @xmath41 is concentrated at a vertex @xmath69 , in the case of even @xmath0 , the limiting distribution for the quantum walk on a cycle is @xmath70 where @xmath71 for all pairs @xmath72 , with an exception for the two points @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where its value is @xmath75 . for a cycle with an odd length @xmath0 , we get @xmath76 with @xmath77 defined in the same way as for even @xmath0 , equal to zero for all pairs @xmath72 except for @xmath73 , where @xmath78 . the slight differences from a uniform distribution arise because not all of the eigenvalues are doubly degenerate .",
    "proving that the time - averaged distribution converges towards the limiting distribution for @xmath79 takes more work .",
    "we want to show that the total distribution distance @xmath52 goes to zero as @xmath79 .",
    "when computing @xmath80 , the terms with @xmath81 produce the limiting distribution @xmath82 and are thus subtracted out .",
    "however , the terms left over ( which were killed by the @xmath83 limit when computing @xmath84 ) need to be carefully accounted for and govern the convergence . in ,",
    "we have a bound on the total distribution distance by a sum over pairs of inequal eigenvalues .",
    "we will upper bound this sum in section [ sec : method ] , using a general approach of lower bounding the terms @xmath85 in .",
    "this result is then applicable to several other walks on necklaces .",
    "the rate of convergence of the time - averaged distribution towards the limiting distribution is governed by a sum of @xmath86 over non - equal eigenvalues as in .",
    "we will now show a method for upper bounding it that will work in several cases .",
    "first , let us choose two particular sectors of eigenvalues , fixing @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is often possible to bound the eigenvalue differences for this sector as @xmath89 for some constant @xmath90 , where where @xmath91 are the momenta , and the indices @xmath92 run from @xmath46 to @xmath93 , observing @xmath94 .",
    "we will rewrite using the substitution @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 where @xmath98 while @xmath99 , and @xmath100 while @xmath101 .",
    "first , because of symmetry , we observe that it is enough to sum only over @xmath102 and multiply the resulting sum by 4 .",
    "second , it can only increase our upper bound if we count all @xmath103 , instead of having to take care with counting starting at @xmath104 .",
    "the symmetry of the term involving @xmath105 then again allows us to sum only up to @xmath106 and multiply the result by 4 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath107 recalling now that @xmath108 , we can deal with each sum as @xmath109 thus finally expressing the sum in ( note that we worked only in a single @xmath110 sector ) as @xmath111 where the extra factor @xmath112 comes from the term @xmath113 , when we expect the initial state to have roughly equal overlap with all momentum states . according to and working this out for all sectors",
    "@xmath110 , this suffices to show an upper bound on the mixing time ( in the time - averaged sense ) for this type of quantum walk , which grows with the system size a @xmath114 .",
    "we will now show that for particular examples of walks on necklaces , the eigenvalues obey , and so that we can use the above approach for proving their convergence .",
    "the first example that we can deal with using this method is the cycle itself , where is an equality .",
    "therefore , we have just shown that the time - averaged distribution ( when starting from a single point ) converges to the limiting distribution for a cycle of length @xmath0 with mixing time @xmath115 ( up to logarithmic factors ) .",
    "we now look at a specific type of necklaces , which appear in the quantum - walk based model of computation @xcite .",
    "these `` combs '' are constructed from a ring of length @xmath116 by attaching an extra node ( tooth ) to the ring at every @xmath117-th vertex as in fig .",
    "[ figurecombkd ] .",
    "the `` pearl '' in this comb - like graph has size @xmath118 , and there are @xmath0 of them , so the total number of vertices in this graph is @xmath119 .",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath15 of the hamiltonian are symmetrically distributed around zero , and each of them is also doubled if @xmath0 is even .",
    "note that two of the eigenvectors @xmath130 are zero on every other base and tooth , and correspond to eigenvalues @xmath131 .",
    "the limiting distribution is analyzed in appendix [ app : comb1 ] .",
    "we find that for large @xmath0 , the limiting distribution ( when starting from a base vertex ) is @xmath132 on base vertices and @xmath133 on teeth , with corrections for the initial vertex and the vertex across from it .",
    "we now prove convergence to the time - averaged limiting distribution , showing that the ( time - averaged ) mixing on this densest comb is no different than the one we saw for a cycle .",
    "we will upper bound the sum in by the method in section [ sec : method ] , dividing the eigenvalues into 4 regions , @xmath134 , corresponding to choices of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in the @xmath135 and @xmath136 regions , we have @xmath137 so the inverse of such terms does not govern the scaling in .",
    "the important region combinations must then be @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where a few lines of algebra give us @xmath140 as the eigenvalues are well bounded away from zero .",
    "armed with this inequality , and the fact that the overlap of a single - starting - vertex initial state with the eigenvectors scales as @xmath141 , we can now use the result of section [ sec : method ] .",
    "this gives us an upper bound on the mixing time for the @xmath122-comb necklace , scaling with @xmath0 as @xmath142 , i.e. the same as for a cycle with no teeth , up to logarithmic factors .",
    "the next example is the @xmath143 comb .",
    "it has a tooth ( extra vertex ) at every second node of the basic loop , so its pearl @xmath10 has three vertices .",

    "the only interesting cases are thus the @xmath138 and @xmath139 choices of eigenvalue pairs . there",
