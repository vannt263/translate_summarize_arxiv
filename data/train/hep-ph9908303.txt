    "the hera data of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) measured in the last few years contain a sizeable fraction of events with a large rapidity gap in the forward region  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is present even at high @xmath1 and results from a colour  singlet exchange between the dissociated virtual photon and the recoiling proton ( or proton remnant ) , characterizing what is usually called _ diffractive _ dis ( ddis ) .",
    "the measurement of ddis at hera provides an unique opportunity to study diffraction in regions in which perturbative qcd is applicable .",
    "open heavy quark production at hera is also a subject of major interest in qcd phenomenology . both the h1 and zeus collaborations have found the charm component of the structure function , @xmath2 , to be a large fraction of @xmath3 at small @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "recently the first measurements of the @xmath5cross section have been reported  @xcite . due to the higher mass of the @xmath6quark ,",
    "it is two order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath7cross section  @xcite .    for the moment",
    "most of the experimental data is for the neutral current structure function @xmath3 .",
    "a number of theoretical estimates of @xmath2 has recently been obtained  @xcite ( see also a review in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider ddis with open charm production and calculate a charm contribution to the diffractive structure function @xmath8 .",
    "there are two different approaches to a treatment of the charm component in structure functions . in one approach",
    "@xcite the charm is an active flavor which undergoes massless renormalization group ( rg ) evolution .",
    "we will follow another approach in which only light ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) quarks and gluons are active partons and no initial state heavy quark lines show up in any diagram  @xcite .",
    "it involves the calculation of the photon ",
    "gluon fusion process and thus is quite sensitive to the gluon distribution .    for the time being , the gluon distributions inside the pomeron predicted by a number of models are dramatically different and they have different shapes .",
    "the diffractive production of open charm at hera will , therefore , provide us the possibility for a direct test of the models .    the present analysis is partially based on a previous study on the pomeron structure function @xcite in which charm contribution was not considered .",
    "this study was mostly concerned with effects of the pomeron flux factor on the evaluation of the diffractive structure fuction .",
    "such effects are a central issue also in the present analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe how to take into account the charm content of the pomeron .",
    "the charm contribution to the diffractive structure function is evaluated in section iii , where the comparison with other models is also given .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in section iv .",
    "after integration over the entire @xmath12 range , the ddis inclusive cross section can be written as @xmath13\\ f_2^{d(3 ) } ( \\beta , q^2,x_{\\rm   i\\ ! p } ) ,   \\label{2}\\ ] ] where the contribution due to longitudinal structure function , @xmath14 , has been neglected since it is expected to be small . here",
    "the following kinematic variables are used to describe ddis ( in addition to usual dis variables @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the invariant mass of the diffractive system . the kinematical variable @xmath20 defined in eq .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) can be interpreted as the fraction of the proton momentum transferred to the pomeron , while @xmath21 , given by eq .",
    "( [ 4b ] ) , may be considered as the momentum fraction of the pomeron carried by the quark coupling to the photon . to simplify the notation , in what follows",
    "we will often write @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 .    in a fit to the full data sample , h1 collaboration has found that a description of @xmath24 that considers only diffractive exchange requires a @xmath21dependent pomeron intercept .",
    "however , this factorization breaking may be explained by introducing secondary trajectories  @xcite .",
    "so , we suggest that , in the region where pomeron exchange is the dominant process , the diffractive structure function could be expressed in a factorized form , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the integrated pomeron flux factor , and @xmath27 is the pomeron structure function  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of @xmath6quarks to @xmath22 is expected to be negligible due to the large mass of the bottom quark ( as it takes place for dis ) .",
    "thus , we can omit this contribution and write @xmath28 @xmath29 being the electric charge of the quark @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .    for @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the charm - quark mass",
    ", we can regard @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks to be massless and put ( both the quark and antiquark are included in the distribution @xmath34 ) @xmath35 that results in @xmath36    recently , a factorization theorem has been proved for diffractive lepton scattering off nucleons  @xcite from which structure functions of ddis coincide with dis structure functions .",
    "therefore , quark and gluon distributions inside the pomeron , @xmath34 and @xmath37 , obey the same set of rg evolution equations as quark and gluon distributions inside the proton do .",
    "as the observed values of @xmath21 are not too small , dglap equations  @xcite can be used to perform such an evolution .    in the present analysis",
    ", we suppose that charm quarks are mainly produced by virtual photon ",
    "gluon fusion and do not take part in the evolution of the light quarks .",

    ", the non - diffractive structure function @xmath38 contains between 10% ( low @xmath1 ) and 30% ( high @xmath1 ) of charm at small @xmath4 . from these figures",
    ", we see that the charm contribution to @xmath135 grows with the decrease of @xmath121 and is a little bit larger for the hard gluon distribution ( fig .",
    "1 ) than it is for the super - hard gluons ( fig .  2 ) . however , for both parametrizations ( fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2 ) it is comparable with the experimental errors of the h1 and zeus data and , consequently , can likely be measured in forthcoming hera experiments on diffractive dissociation processes .    on the other hand , for the renormalized flux factor",
    "the charm component is very small in the full range of @xmath21 and @xmath1 presented in fig .",
    "the reason is that the initial gluon distribution for this case , eq .",
    "( [ 70 ] ) , is much smaller as compared to the initial gluon distribution with the same form for the standard flux factor , eq .",
    "( [ 66 ] ) .    another way of comparing these results is shown in fig .  4 in terms of @xmath136 , which is calculated for the three combinations of pomeron flux factors with the respective structure functions considered here",
    "two main features that characterize our predictions for @xmath136 are evident in this figure : ( 1 ) the shape of the @xmath21 distributions are quite similar ( they are moderately hard at the initial scale ) and change similarly with @xmath1 evolution ; ( 2 ) the amount of charm is different in each case with the proportions seen in the figure .      the diffractive production of the open charm in dis has been studied in the framework of perturbative two  gluon exchange between the @xmath7pair and the proton in refs .  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , non  perturbative approaches were used to calculate cross sections and spectra for charm quark pair production .    one common aspect of some of these models ( the first two of refs .",
    "@xcite and the first one of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which is in contrast with the results of our analysis shown in fig .",
    "4 is that their predictions for the charm contribution practically do not change at low @xmath21 with @xmath1 evolution .",

    "this last aspect is also observed in the analysis by levin _",
    "@xcite , although in this case the low @xmath21 behavior does not follow the others .",
    "another general observation is that the obtained steep rise of the charm component towards small @xmath121 is in qualitative accordance with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .  5",
    ", we present a quantitative comparison of our results for the charm contribution to @xmath137 with of those obtained by lotter @xcite for two @xmath1 values and @xmath138 .",
    "it is seen that , in terms of the amount of charm , lotter s predictions are comparable only to our renormalized case ( fit 3 ) , although in terms of shape these distributions are quite different .",
    "let us note , however , that lotter s model is not adequate to describe diffraction in the complete @xmath21-range as was mentioned by the author  @xcite .",
    "now let us consider other models , reminding that our analysis was performed in the context of the ingelman  schlein model .",
    "predictions for the charm contribution to the pomeron structure function have been made by using the same scheme in refs .",
    "however , no estimates of the charm contribution to the diffractive structure function @xmath69 have been presented .    in fig .",
    "6 , we present a comparison of our predictions for @xmath136 with those obtained by haakman _",
    "we see that in their analysis the charm structure function is pretty soft even at low @xmath1 where our results are predominantely hard . in terms of amount of charm , their results are comparable only to our fit 3 .",
    "we have considered in this paper the charm content of the pomeron and its effects on the structure function measured in diffractive deep inelastic scattering .    in the present analysis ,",
    "the formulas are derived in a way to define this contribution from the quark and gluon distributions inside the pomeron obtained previously by fitting hera data on diffractive deep inelastic scattering .",
    "two parametrizations have been chosen for the standard pomeron flux factor corresponding to the hard and superhard gluon components of the pomeron , whereas for the renormalized flux factor , the hard parton parametrization has been analyzed .",
    "numerical calculations show that the results depend crucially on the pomeron flux factor .",
    "in particular , the charm content of the pomeron is expected to be very small for the renormalized flux factor . as for charm contribution corresponding to the standard flux factor ,",
