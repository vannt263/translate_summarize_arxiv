    "there is recently much interest in spin polarized transport in ferromagnetic tunnel junctions , motivated by the high d.c .",
    "magnetoresistance observed,@xcite and their potential applications as magnetic sensors and nonvolatile memories .",
    "these structures are junctions of two metals with a thin ( @xmath3 ) layer of an insulator in between .",
    "they are symbolically denoted as an f - i - f structure where i stands for insulator .",
    "the spin polarized transport in this system has been studied theoretically without taking into account the electron - electron ( e - e ) interation@xcite and including the e - e interaction.@xcite it is found that@xcite in tunnel junctions at least one side of which is a ferromagnet , under steady state moderate currents ( @xmath4 ampere ) there will be a * very large * change in the polarization ( @xmath5 ) and splitting of the spin up and spin down fermi energies ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the implication of this splitting has not been explored . by applying different voltages ,",
    "the fermi levels can be moved and different parts of the band structure can be probed .",
    "different physical characteristics of different parts of the band structure can be manifested .",
    "one can envision inducing different phase transitions by tuning the applied voltage .",
    "experimental results that illustrate the new physics that can happen as a result of the splitting are beginning to appear .",
    "the big splitting of the spin up and spin down fermi energies provides for an explanation of the bias dependence that is experimentally observed.@xcite we discussed here an illustration of the probing of a different part of the band structure with a detailed calculation of a giant anomolous hall resistivity recently discovered in co - i - al tunnel junctions.@xcite good agreements with the experimental results are obtained .",
    "we then conclude by discussing two other experiments that provide further illustration for the conclusion discussed here .",
    "the changes in the fermi levels can in principle also be produced by external magnetic fields of strength of the order of 1000 teslas .",
    "this field strength is much higher than can be created by the highest magnetic field on earth .",
    "this presents a possibility of a new area of research of ultrahigh magnetic field physics . that a current can induce a magnetization in a ferromagnetic- paramagnetic junction ( no insulator in between ) was first discussed by johnson and silsbee@xcite and van son et al.@xcite .",
    "the magnetized current from the ferromagnet induces a magnetization in the paramagnet due to a spin bottleneck effect and causes a splitting of the spin up and the spin down fermi energies @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio of this splitting to the driving current @xmath8 is of the order of the resistance of the * metal*. this same reasoning can also be applied to the f - i - p structure with an insulator in between , and the magnetization and the splitting is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the resulting magnetization from this `` spin accumulation effect '' is very small and is different from the physics discussed here . for the f - i - p structure and our mechanism ,",
    "the ratio @xmath9 is of the order of the resistance of the * insulating barrier*. this is several orders of magnitude larger than that expected from the spin accumulation effect .",
    "we first recapitulate briefly the reasoning that led to the splitting of the fermi levels .",
    "the physics can be approximatly described by the following sets of equations .",
    "the first is that of global charge current conservation:@xcite @xmath10 here @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the total ( including both spins ) current and charge densities . the second equation is the diffusion equation which expresses the current density for spin s , @xmath13 as a sum of ( a ) the external driving current @xmath14 that is controlled by the conductivity @xmath15 and the external electric field @xmath16 ; ( b ) the current driven by a density gradient ( diffusion ) expressed as a gradient of the chemical potential @xmath17 through the density of states at the fermi surface @xmath18 and ( c ) the current driven by the internal electric `` screening '' field @xmath19:@xcite @xmath20/e\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is the conductivity for spin channel s. @xmath21 is the local electric ( screening ) potential due to the other electric charges that is determined self - consistently : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the coulomb potential . because of this self - consistent screening , charge fluctuation dies off with a length scale @xmath24 called the screening length,@xcite which is of the order of 10   for metals .",
    "finally , the magnetization density * changes * @xmath25 relaxes with a length scale of @xmath26 where the bar indicates a renormalization effect due to the electric field:@xcite @xmath27 for the systems of interest , the spin diffusion length @xmath26 , is of the order of 1000 to 10000   and is much larger than the screening length @xmath24 .",
    "because of these two very different length scales , there is a delicate balance in the current from the charge and the magnetization diffusion that has to be maintained .",
    "one can solve these sets of equations on each side of the junction .",
    "the currents on opposite sides of the junction are related by the boundary condition that the current @xmath28 is continuous across the junction and that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the resistivity of the junction for spin @xmath31 .",
    "the final solution can be developed in increasing powers of @xmath32 . solving equations ( 1 - 3 ) for a junction of thickness d at the origin",
    ", we find `` dipole layers '' of charge ( @xmath12 ) and magnetization ( @xmath25 ) densities that peaks at the junction and dies off exponentially away from the junction with a functional form @xmath33$]:@xcite @xmath34 @xmath35 in this paper , we use units of @xmath25 in terms of the bohr magneton .",
    "the charge and magnetization densities are now coupled : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a coefficient of the order of unity.@xcite @xmath38 here @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the diffusion constant for the magnetization ( charge ) that can be expressed in terms of the conductivities.@xcite the charge dipole layer densities are smaller than the magnetization densities by a factor @xmath32 ! this comes from the two very different length scale of change for the charge and the magnetization degrees of freedom .",
    "there is a small correction to the charge density that is of much longer range than the screening length . in general the constants @xmath41 , @xmath42 on opposite sides of the junction",
    "can be different from each other .",
    "the * total * charge on opposite sides of the junction are opposite in sign and equal in magnitude , of course . after matching the boundary condition ( eq . ( 4 ) ) one obtains for the magnetization and the fermi energy splitting:@xcite",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a coefficient of the order of the inverse density of states at the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "it is different for parallel and antiparallel alignment of the magnetizations on opposite sides of the junction .",
    "thus the magnetization density induced is controlled by the resistance of the * junction * , not of the metal ! to illustarate the application of this , we first calculate the hall conductivity @xmath46 of al in a co - i - al junction .",
    "otani et al.@xcite recently measured the hall coefficient of al in a co - i - al structure .",
    "they found that above a threshold voltage of about 1 volt , there is a rapid increase in the hall voltage that is of the same sign ( negative ) as but much larger than the ordinary hall coefficient of al .",
    "this effect disappears as the temperature is increased from 30k to 150 k. their original explanation in terms of an extraordinary hall effect is inapplicable with a revised estimate of the hall resistivity that is several orders of magnitude higher .    in our picture , as the external voltage @xmath47",
    "is increased , the spin up and spin down fermi energies will move apart by an amount @xmath48 proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "the sample is polycrystalline experimentally@xcite , without detail knowledge of the nature of this polycrystalline sample , for simplicity we consider the crystal structure as a single fcc crystal of bulk al with lattice parameter 4.0491 , and have taken the direction of the magnetization parallel to the @xmath49 symmetry axis of al .",
    "we have calculated the hall conductivity @xmath46 from first principles as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "our calculations are performed using the band structure obtained with the self - consistent full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method @xcite under the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite with spin - orbit coupling@xcite .",
    "the conductivity is calculated using the kubo formula .",
    "the brillouin zone sampling is performed using _ 4000 _ special k - point meshes , which yielded _ 315 _ points in the irreducible brillouin zone.@xcite the dependence of conductivity on the frequency have been tested on the kerr effect of bcc fe . for an inverse lifetime @xmath51 , our result is in very good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the hall conductivity is the zero frequenct limit of the conductivity .",
    "our result for the hall conductivity is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the sign and the shape ( including the threshold ) are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the physics of the threshold and the temperature dependence can be understood as follows .",
    "the band structure of al with the spin up and spin down fermi levels is shown in fig 2 for the case @xmath52 .",
    "two band crosses along the direction xzw .",
    "the crossing is spin - orbit split . at zero magnetization",
    ", this corssing is below the fermi energy .",
    "when the spin - up and the spin down fermi levels move apart , one of them will move towards this crossing and a significant interband contribution will come in for the hall conductivity .",
    "the thresold is determined by the distance between the energy at this crossing and the fermi energy at zero field .",
    "because the spin - orbit band gap is very small , we expect the interband contribution will decrease significantly when the temperature becomes comparable to this band gap .",
    "the magnitude of our result depends on the scattering time @xmath53 .",
    "our result is in the range of 1 to 10 @xmath54 . because of the nonuniformity of the current flow due to the geometry of the experimental sample , and becuase we do not know the detail material characteristic of the polycrystalline experimental sample",
    ", we do not expect to get * exact * quantitative agreement with the experimental results . if we pick a typical @xmath55 ,",
    "our result is in good agreement with experimentally revised value of @xmath56 for an average @xmath57 .",
    "( recall that @xmath58 . )",
    "this diagonal resistivity is consistent with recent unpublished results by the same authors for a ohmic ( f - p ) co - al junction .",
    "our picture can be further tested experimentally . in our calculation",
    ", the hall resistance goes through a maximum and decreases as the bias voltage is further increased . so far the experiment was carried out up to a bias when the maximum of @xmath59 was reached .",
    "we predict that the hall resistivity will decrease as the voltage is further increased .",
    "we next discuss some other recent experimental results that supports the present picture .",
    "moodera and coworkers recently found a fascinating series of bias dependences , including a negative junction magnetoresistance , for a f - i - p - f structure with varying thickness for the paramagnet.@xcite to explain their result , they assuumed a model with different spin up and spin down fermi energies . the result discussed here",
    "provides for a possible justification of the model that they have used .",
    "ono , shimada and ootuka@xcite recently studied the magnetoresistance of ferromagnetic single electron transistors made from tunnel structures .",
    "depending on the gate voltage , this device can be in an on or an off state . in the on - state",
    ", they found a magnetoresistance ratio of about 4 % .",
    "they observed a ten fold increase of the magnetoresistance ratio in the off - state . in the off - state",
    ", the transport depends * exponentially * on the activation barrier which is a * sum * of the coulomb charging energy and the difference of the fermi energy on the left and the right hand side of the junction.@xcite the large magnetoresistance can be understood in the present picture from the different splitting of the fermi levels between the cases of the parallel and the antiparallel alignment of the magnetizations .    in conclusion",
    ", we propose that magnetic tunnel junction provides for new opportunities to observe high magnetic field physics . theoretical and experimental evidences are provided to support this claim .",
