    "g357.7@xmath00.1 is a bright radio object near the galactic center ( gc ) direction and was first catalogued by @xcite as msh17 - 3_9_. the extended , non - thermal emission with the spectral index of @xmath2 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the linear polarization of @xmath310% ( e.g. @xcite ) placed this source as one of the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "it has an elongated shape with @xmath4 length and has the brightest peak offset to one side , which is called the `` head '' , while fainter emissions are elongated to the other side , called the `` tail '' .",
    "unusual structure was found with the higher resolution observations .",
    "the remarkable feature is the several co - axial filamentary arcs swirling around its major axis , and hence nicknamed as the `` tornado nebula '' ( figure  [ fig : xisimg]a : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite corrected the large - scale brightness gradient of the radio map , and found a bipolar radio structure along the major axis .",
    "the distance to the tornado is constrained to be @xmath5  kpc from h absorption measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , oh maser at 1720 mhz , supporting evidence for the shocked molecular clouds , is detected at the head ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . from the velocity of the oh maser ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 )",
    ", the distance is estimated to be 11.8  kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath8 emission lines are also detected toward the head of the tornado ( @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the tornado nebula has been controversial due to its peculiar appearance .",
    "some scenarios are based on the head - tail structure ; the center of activity is located at the brightest head and the tail is the periphery structure .",
    "the source may be either a radio galaxy with one - sided jet ( , ) , a galactic nebula powered by a pulsar , or a galactic binary source located at the head ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the other scenarios are along the lines of bipolar - like structure : an extragalactic double - lobed source ( @xcite ) , an exotic remnant by an equatorial supernova of a rotating massive star ( @xcite ) , or precessing jets of binary accretion system ( @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of these scenarios is that no compact source has been found near at the center of the tornado .    [",

    "then @xcite discovered a diffuse x - ray source in the head with chandra . from the centrally filled x - rays",
    ", the authors proposed that the tornado is a galactic mixed - morphology snr ( @xcite ) . however the nature of the x - rays , whether thermal or non - thermal , was not clear due to the limited photon statistics .    in order to give further constraint on the origin from the high energy phenomena , we conducted deep x - ray observations on the tornado nebula with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) onboard suzaku ( @xcite ) .",
    "we present the discovery of twin thermal plasmas associated with the head and tail of the tornado .",
    "we investigate possible interaction of the tornado with molecular clouds by referring the data from the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45-m telescope . based on these new results ,",
    "we discuss the nature of the x - ray source .    throughout this paper , east and west indicate for the direction in the galactic longitude , and north and south for that in the galactic latitude .",
    "statistical uncertainties are represented by the 90% confidence intervals .",
    "the tornado nebula was observed twice .",
    "the first observation was centered at the head region , while the second covered the whole structure of the tornado .",
    "the observation log is given in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the xis consists of four ccd cameras each placed at the focal planes of four x - ray telescopes ( xrts : @xcite ) .",
    "three sensors employ front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) while the other employs a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd ( xis1 ) .",
    "xis2 has not been functional since an anomaly in 2006 november .",
    "the xis is equipped with spaced - row charge injection technique ( sci : @xcite ) to restore the radiation - induced degradation of the energy gain and resolution .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of xis combined with xrt covers an @xmath9 region with a pixel scale of  pixel@xmath7 .",
    "an angular resolution of  in the half - power diameter ( hpd ) is almost independent of photon energies and off - axis angles within @xmath4 10% .",
    "the total effective area of operational xis0 , 1 , and 3 with three xrts is 430  @xmath10 at 8  kev . due to the low orbital altitude of suzaku at @xmath4 550  km , the xis achieves a low and stable background environment suitable for studying faint diffuse sources .    in the present observations ,",
    "the xis was operated in the normal clocking mode with the sci technique .",
    "the data reduction was made from the pipeline processing version 2.4 .",
    "we updated the gain correction method to be optimized for the sci ( @xcite ) by using the makepi files version 20090915 provided by the xis team .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the energy scale is @xmath3 10  ev at 5.9  kev .",
    "we removed events during the south atlantic anomaly passages and earth night - time and day - time elevation angles below and , respectively .",
    "we also removed hot and flickering pixels .",
    "we reduced the data using the software packages headas version 6.9 .",
    "in the spectral analysis , we used the xspec ( @xcite ) version 12.5.1 . the non  x - ray background ( nxb )",
    "data were generated by xisnxbgen ( @xcite ) .",
    "the redistribution matrix function is generated by xisrmfgen and the auxiliary response function is made by a ray - tracing simulator xissimarfgen ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nxb subtracted data were used to make the three - band x - ray images in the soft ( 0.51.5 kev ) , medium ( 1.53.0 kev ) , and hard ( 3.07.0 kev ) bands .",
    "figure  [ fig : xisimg]b shows the results after the vignetting correction .",
    "we see two diffuse emissions only in the medium band ( 1.53.0 kev ) .",
    "we hereafter call these sources as `` nw '' and `` se '' .",
    "the apparent sizes of nw and se are @xmath4 , which are larger than the hpd of the suzaku xrt ( @xmath4 ) . thus these x - ray sources are not single point sources , but diffuse or ensemble of multiple point sources .",
    "we then searched for x - ray point sources in the source areas from the chandra catalog ( @xcite ) , and found only one chandra point source in the se area .",
    "the flux is only @xmath11% of the total flux ( after the background subtraction ; see   [ sec : bg ] and   [ sec : nwse ] ) in the se area in the 1.27.0  kev band .",
    "we further made the x - ray light - curve from nw and se areas , and found no time variability of these sources . thus nw and se must be extended sources .      the background x - rays in the source ( nw and se ) areas are mainly due to the galactic diffuse x - ray emission ( gdxe ) , because the two sources are near the gc and the galactic plane .",
    "the flux ( surface brightness ) of the gdxe smoothly decreases with increasing distances from the gc and the plane , while the spectrum shape has no significant position - to - position variation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to investigate the flux and spectrum variation near the source fields",
    ", we select two background regions from the nearby blank sky ( bg1 and bg2 : broken ellipses in figure  [ fig : xisimg ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bgspec ] shows the nxb - subtracted spectra of bg1 and bg2 .",
    "we see that the over - all spectral structures and fluxes are very similar to each other .    for the quantitative study , we conducted spectral fittings with the following process .",
    "the gdxe is known to exhibit strong k - shell lines from highly ionized silicon ( si ) , sulfur ( s ) , and iron ( fe ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the xis spectra of bg1 and bg2 clearly exhibit the highly ionized si , s , and fe k - shell lines .",
    "the co - existence of these lines indicates that the spectra require at least two temperature plasmas .    the previous studies on the gdxe near the gc direction ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) showed that the gdxe spectra can be fitted with two plasmas in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) : a low - temperature ( @xmath12  kev ) cie for the si and s lines , and a high - temperature ( @xmath13  kev ) cie for the fe line .",
    "we therefore apply a two - temperature cie plasma model by using the apec code ( @xcite ) . we also included a gaussian in the gdxe as a k@xmath14 emission line at 6.40  kev from neutral irons ( fe ) , which is also found in the gdxe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these three components are attenuated by interstellar extinction ( wabs : @xcite ) toward the gc distance .",
    "then , the gdxe is written as :    @xmath15    the temperatures ( @xmath16 ) , chemical abundance of metals ( @xmath17 ) relative to the solar values ( @xcite ) , the volume emission measures of the plasmas , the surface brightness of fe k@xmath14 line ( @xmath18 ) , and the hydrogen - equivalent column density of the absorbing materials ( @xmath19 ) were free parameters .",

    "201/171 & 190/171 +    as is seen in figure 2 , the spectra of bg1 and bg2 exhibit significant emission in the soft band ( 0.51.5  kev ) .",
    "if these soft x - rays come from the gdxe , the x - rays should be heavily attenuated by interstellar extinction toward the gc distance",
    ". therefore the soft x - rays are mainly foreground emissions .",
    "the soft x - rays are also observed near the gc region ( @xmath40 ) by @xcite .",
    "they found that the soft x - ray emission is almost uniform within the central one degree on the plane .",
    "they applied the model below :    @xmath41    since the absolute galactic latitude of the tornado fields are close to that of the region of @xcite , we can reasonably assume that the typical parameters for the soft x - ray spectrum are same as those of @xcite : the plasma temperature of 0.9  kev , the chemical abundance of @xmath42  @xmath30 , and the hydrogen - equivalent absorption column of @xmath43  @xmath34 .",
    "thus for the foreground soft x - ray spectrum , only the normalization was a free parameter .",
    "the other background component , the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , is isotropic and we adopted the empirical form , an absorbed power - law :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the normalization constant at 1  kev and @xmath46 is the photon index of the power - law .",
    "these are fixed to be @xmath47  photons  s@xmath7  @xmath34  arcmin@xmath48 and @xmath49 according to @xcite .",
    "since the cxb should be absorbed by the interstellar materials throughout the whole galaxy , we assumed the hydrogen - equivalent absorption column toward the cxb to be twice of that for the gdxe ( @xmath1 ) .    in the model",

    "we clearly see several emission lines from highly ionized atoms , si , s and argon ( ar ) . we therefore fitted the spectra with an optically thin thermal plasma model in cie ( apec ) absorbed by the interstellar medium ( wabs ) .",
    "free parameters were the chemical abundances of si , s , and ar , the temperatures and normalization of the cie plasma , and absorption ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "since the properties of the x - ray plasmas are almost identical , these would be the twins formed by a common process .",
    "a plausible scenario is that the x - ray plasmas have been generated by the termination shocks at the intersecting molecular clouds .",
    "in fact the shocked molecular cloud associated with the tornado has been found near nw ( @xcite ) . to confirm the cloud interactions , we further search for the molecular structure near at the nw and se regions using the data of co @xmath7610 taken with the nro 45-m telescope ( private communication with t. oka ) .",
    "the results in the velocity range of @xmath77  km  s@xmath7 , close to the velocity of the oh maser near at nw , are shown in figure  [ fig : multiimg ] .",
    "we clearly see co counterparts near nw ( mc1 ) and se ( mc2 ) .    as we described in   [ sec : intro ] ( introduction ) , many ideas for the origin of the tornado have been proposed . the present result that the tornado has bipolar x - rays at the head and tail excludes most of these scenarios . in the following sections (   [ sec : jet ] and   [ sec : remnant ] ) , we discuss two plausible origins .",
    "one possibility is that the tornado is made by bipolar jets from a binary accretion system .",
    "the filamentary radio arcs swirling around the major axis would be due to the precession of jets as is found in ss433 .",
    "the twin x - ray emitting plasmas are made by the shock with molecular clouds .",
    "bipolar jets have usually a bright central power source , but no x - ray source is found from the center of the tornado nebula .",
    "we set the 3-@xmath68 upper limit on the luminosity to be @xmath78  erg  s@xmath7 in the 0.510.0  kev band , assuming the absorption column of @xmath79  @xmath34 , the power - law spectrum with the photon index of 2 , and the distance of 12  kpc .",
    "chandra has gave more severe constraint of @xmath80  erg  s@xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these upper limits are only less than 1% of nw and se luminosities of @xmath81  erg  s@xmath7 and @xmath82  erg  s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "a plausible explanation for the non - detection of the bright central source is that putative binary went into a quiescent state after forming jet - structures in a past active phase .",
    "the synchrotron cooling timescale ( @xcite ) for electrons which emit @xmath83  kev photons in a magnetic field @xmath84  g is estimated to be , @xmath85 assuming the magnetic field of @xmath86  @xmath87 g ( @xcite ) , the cooling timescale for @xmath88 kev photons is estimated to be less than @xmath44050  years .",
    "the lower energy electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron radiation can survive much longer time .",
    "the cooling time of the x - ray emitting plasma , which are made by the interaction between the jets and the molecular clouds , is also much longer .",
    "thus the radio tornado and the twin x - rays at the both ends would be fossil radiations of a past activity some @xmath44050  years ago .",
    "although such object is very rare , we see a hint in the jets of 4u1755@xmath033 .",
    "the central source is in low luminosity of @xmath89  erg s@xmath7 at present , but was bright two decades ago ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative possibility for the bipolar structure of the tornado is a remnant of an equatorial explosion of a rotating high mass star ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a hypernova explosion associated with a @xmath90-ray burst may produce a bipolar blast wave ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this blast wave hits molecular clouds , then the double x - ray spots will be produced .",
    "this scenario does not necessary require a central source .",
    "however , a hypernova is very energetic , and in our case , the explosion energy is less than @xmath91 erg s@xmath7 ( table 4 ) .",
    "we therefore suspect this possibility is less likely compared to the bipolar - jet model of an x - ray binary .",
    "1 .   we detected two diffuse x - ray sources and obtained the high quality spectra with the xis . both the spectra exhibit clear emission lines from highly ionized atoms , which establish the optically thin hot plasma nature .",
    "the properties of the plasmas are almost the same with each other .",
    "we derived the distances to the sources by using the x - ray absorption and found that both the sources are the galactic objects located slightly beyond the gc distance , at the consistent distance with the radio object , tornado .",
    "thus , together with the association in the projected image , the two x - ray sources are physically connected to the tornado nebula .",
    "3 .   the discovery of the twin thermal plasmas at the head and tail of the tornado confirm the symmetric structure with respect to the center .",
    "4 .   the most plausible origin is a bipolar jet from an accreting binary which had been active in the past and has recently entered the quiescent state . in this view , the x - ray emission is a fossil radiation from shock heated gas made by the past jet activity of the central core source .",
    "the non - thermal synchrotron x - rays may be already cooled down below the detection limit .    the authors thank all of the suzaku team members for their full support of the suzaku project . we acknowledge the financial support from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan ; the grant - in - aid for the global coe program `` the next generation of physics , spun from universality and emergence '' and others for scientific research b ( no .",

    "<S> the tornado nebula ( g357.7@xmath00.1 ) is a mysterious radio source with bright `` head '' and faint `` tail '' located in the direction of the galactic center ( gc ) region . </S>",
    "<S> we here report the discovery of two diffuse x - ray sources at the head and tail of the tornado with the suzaku satellite . </S>",
    "<S> we found emission lines from highly ionized atoms in the two sources . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are reproduced by an optically thin thermal plasma with a common temperature of 0.60.7  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the interstellar absorption ( @xmath1 ) of these sources are the same and are slightly larger than that of the gc distance . </S>",
    "<S> since the estimated distance using the @xmath1 value is consistent with the radio observation of the tornado , these x - ray sources are likely associated with the tornado nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the twin - plasma morphology at the both ends of the tornado suggests that the system is a bipolar / outflow source . </S>"
