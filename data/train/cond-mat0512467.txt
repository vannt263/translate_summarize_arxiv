    "exciton - exciton interactions in quantum wells are becoming increasingly important to science and technology .",
    "for example , the interaction of two excitons is a mechanism for non - linear optical response @xcite .",
    "it is the excitonic component of polaritons that lead to their interactions .",
    "also , in experimental studies of cold excitonic gases in quantum wells , exciton - exciton scattering is a process that drives the excitons towards a bose distribution .",
    "exciton - exciton interactions are difficult to theoretically predict @xcite .",
    "fast collisions between excitons may be treated with time dependent perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "carrier exchange is known to be a significant contribution to the scattering process @xcite . at a different extreme ,",
    "slow moving excitons interact through dipole interactions .",
    "if the excitons have intrinsic dipoles , perhaps from carefully engineered quantum well bandstructure or an applied electric field , the repulsive dipole - dipole force can dominate interactions @xcite . in the more common case of unpolarized excitons , quantum fluctuations of the polarization",
    "leads to attractive van der waals interactions , which are often neglected . finally , we know that the wavefunction describing elastic exciton collisions must be orthogonal to any bound biexciton states .",
    "the presence of weakly bound biexciton states can have dramatic effect on exciton scattering cross - sections @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have extended a quantum monte carlo technique in order to to study exciton scattering in a gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum wells .",
    "an earlier paper studied bulk exciton - exciton scattering for a generic model of a semiconductor @xcite .",
    "the simulation technique directly samples the energy of the four - particle scattering wavefunction .",
    "this allows all mechanisms listed in the previous paragraph  carrier exchange , dipole and van der waals forces , and orthogonality to bound biexcitons  to be fully incorporated in the numerical simulation .",
    "random walks are used to project essentially exact energies from a set of trial wavefunctions , thus providing numerical estimates of the phase shifts and scattering cross sections for elastic exciton - exciton collisions .",
    "our new calculations apply this technique to a quantum well , allowing a detailed study of the exciton - exciton collision process within the effective mass approximation .",
    "two key results of these calculations are the observation of a second , weakly - bound biexciton and the numerical estimate of a large cross - section @xmath2 nm for low - energy exciton - exciton scattering in a quantum well .    in the next section of this paper ,",
    "we describe the effective mass model we use .",
    "after that we give a brief description of our computational technique and details of our simulation of a gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as well .",
    "the last section is a discussion that emphasizes new results of this paper , some subtleties of two - dimensional scattering , and future directions for this research .",
    "we use a single - band effective mass model , @xmath3 here the electrons are labeled @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the holes are labeled @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the isotropic effective masses are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the dielectric constant is @xmath10 .",
    "( future calculations will include the anisotropy of the heavy - hole mass . ) the confining potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 are finite square wells with offsets @xmath13 ev and @xmath14 mev .",
    "these material constants have been chosen to match other theoretical studies of excitons and biexcitons in gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum wells for direct comparison with this work @xcite .",
    "the electron effective mass and dielectric constant define natural length and energy scales for the problem : the donor effective bohr radius , @xmath15 nm , and the donor effective rydberg , @xmath16 mev . in this paper we present numerical answers to three digits for comparison to other theoretical papers ; such accuracy is beyond the limits of the effective mass model and the leading digit should suffice for comparison to experiments .    for a well of width 9.97 nm",
    ", we find an exciton binding energy of 9.22 mev , using qmc methods described in the next section .",
    "previously published qmc calculations report energies of about 10.0 mev for the exciton binding energy at this well width @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the biexciton binding energy , which is around 1.87@xmath170.01 mev , in very good agreement with experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite values .",
    "we also see a second , very weakly - bound excited biexciton state with binding energy 0.032@xmath170.007 mev .",
    "this state is not likely to be directly observable , but it can have a big influence on the scattering length .",
    "also , note that this calculation is within the effective - mass approximation with isotropic effective masses , and the bound state may be an artifact of this approximation .",
    "nevertheless , this results suggests that a second bound biexciton state is possible in a gaas / algaas quantum well .",
    "the projection over an imaginary time 0.06 mev@xmath18 takes a buffer of 200 monte carlo steps . ]",
    "we use random walks to project a set of wavefunctions in imaginary time , as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we first construct variational wavefunctions corresponding to a bound state and excited state of scattering .",
    "the excitons can be paired two ways : electron @xmath4 can be paired with hole @xmath6 and electron @xmath4 with hole @xmath7 , which we denote @xmath19 , or we can have the pairing @xmath20 .",
    "eigenstates are symmetric or antisymmetric combinations , @xmath21 these wavefunctions can be related to spin states through the symmetry of the wavefunction . in these calculations",
    "we are just studying the @xmath22 wavefunction , since this is the one that has the bound biexciton .",
    "this is one channel for scattering , and to get cross sections for different exciton spin states we will need to study @xmath23 also .",
    "next we discretize the scattering states by restricting the excitons to never be separated by a distance greater than @xmath24 .",
    "we choose values of @xmath24 between 160 nm and 280 nm .",
    "this turns the scattering states into standing waves we can study with qmc . using qmc",
    ", we project the wavefunction with a random walk .",
    "the random walk is repeated projection of the wavefunction with @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : proj ] we show the projection of eigenvalues from the simulation with @xmath24=200 nm .",
    "we clearly see the bound biexciton projected to an energy of about -1.9 mev .",
    "there is also a much more subtle feature : a second weakly bound biexciton state .",
    "this can be thought of as a quantized vibrational excitation in the radial exciton - exciton separation coordinate .        .",
    "]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : evsr ] we show the energy eigenvalues for a series of different @xmath24 values .",
    "we see that the two bound states are relatively insensitive to the boundary condition , while the scattering states systematically decrease in energy with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "these energy curves hold all the information about low energy s - wave scattering . \f since we know the energies of the scattering states , we know the relative momentum k. because we know the scattering function has a node at @xmath24",
    ", we can infer the phase shift , @xmath26 .",
    "we plot the phase shift in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltak ] .",
    "again , the weakly bound vibrationally excited biexciton shows up , this time as the phase tends to @xmath27 , indicating two bound states . the scatter in this data is the monte carlo noise from our simulations . \f    .",
    "]    from the phase shift , we calculate the s - wave scattering cross sections , given by @xmath28 . fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmae ] shows the scattering cross sections from our raw monte carlo data . at low energy ,",
    "the cross section becomes quite large , @xmath29 nm . two effects may contribute : ( 1 ) the weakly - bound excited biexciton state at @xmath30 mev can enhance scattering , and ( 2 ) two dimensional systems have a logarithmic divergence of the scattering cross - section at low energy . the statistical error in these simulations prevents us from distinguishing between these contributions .",
    "scattering in two dimensions differs significantly from three - dimensional scattering @xcite . in particular",
    ", the scattering length can no longer be simply obtained from an effective range expansion @xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "the scattering length characterizes the interaction strength for low energy collisions .",
    "the corresponding quantity in two dimensions is dimensionless : the scattering is characterized by an effective range and a dimensionless parameter . as a simple analysis",
    ", we will extract just one parameter from our results by fitting our phase shifts to a hard - disk model .",
    "this analysis can not capture resonant effects from the weakly bound state , but it does provide a useful length scale .    the phase shift for s - wave scattering for hard disks of radius @xmath6 in two dimensions is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "a crude fit of our calculated values of @xmath33 to the hard disk formula gives @xmath34 with a statistical uncertainty of about 10% .",
    "this suggests the excitons can be approximated as hard disks with radii of 27 nm , if the electron and hole spins are each in singlets as required by our @xmath22 wavefunction .",
    "now we must consider spin .",
    "we have only simulated the @xmath22 scattering states . in bulk , three - dimensional calculations , the @xmath23 have a much smaller contribution to the scattering , since there is now bound biexcition when electrons and holes are spin polarized @xcite . using table iii of ref .",
    "@xcite and neglecting the @xmath23 contribution , we approximate the scattering cross section of paraexcitons as @xmath35 the symmetric value , or 1.7 nm .",
    "two orthoexictons in a relative @xmath36 state have a scattering cross section that is @xmath37 the symmetric value , or 13.5 nm . recall that this hard disk analysis neglects resonant effects from the weakly bound excited biexciton .",
    "future work will include a study of @xmath22 and @xmath23 scattering channels for different geometries .",
    "we will also attempt to extract two parameters , an effective range and a scattering strength , from our calculations .",
    "such a parameterization could provide input for models of thermal equilibration rates and properties a weakly - interacting bose condensate of excitons ."
