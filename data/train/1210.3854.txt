    "ptas are complementary to other gw detection experiments , such as ground - based and space - based interferometers , in that they are sensitive to gws in a different frequency band ( currently @xmath0nhz , i.e. , periods of five years to a few months ) . in this frequency band ,",
    "the most promising astrophysical sources of gws are binary super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "smbhs , with masses in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 , are of great importance to the evolution of galaxies .",

    "models that trace the co - evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) postulate that smbhs grow primarily through accretion and coalescence with other smbhs during active phases triggered by galaxy mergers .",
    "presumably , there exists a large population of binary smbhs at various stages of coalescence in the cores of galaxies that have recently merged with other galaxies .",
    "the final stages of smbh - smbh coalescence are driven by losses of energy and angular momentum to gws , primarily emitted in the pta frequency band .",
    "various works have predicted the average spectrum of the gw strain amplitude from the cosmic population of binary smbhs @xcite . under the assumption that all binary systems are in circular orbits evolving only through gw emission",
    ", this spectrum takes the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the characteristic strain as a function of gw frequency , @xmath5 , at the earth , and @xmath6 is the characteristic strain at a frequency of @xmath7 . the characteristic strain is the gw strain per logarithmic frequency interval , and is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the one - sided strain power spectral density ( psd ) .    the combined gw signal from binary smbhs",
    "is widely assumed to form an isotropic , stochastic gw background .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is used to specify the amplitude of the background .",
    "the most recent predictions for the value of @xmath6 were made by @xcite , who found a likely range of @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "this range of predictions was derived by considering a variety of smbh seeding , accretion and feedback scenarios , as well as uncertainties in the galaxy merger rate and in the smbh mass function .",
    "pta projects are based on observations of periodic pulses of radio emission from pulsars using large radio telescopes .",
    "these observations lead to measurements of pulse times of arrival ( toas ) at the observatories .",
    "toa measurements are typically conducted every few weeks over many years .",
    "pulsar timing involves parameters of a physical model for the toas being fitted to the measured toas , with the differences between the observed toas and the model predictions being the timing residuals .",

    "for any stochastic gw signal , the expected value of the normalized correlation for each pulsar pair is expressed in terms of the angular separations between the pulsars as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the angular separation between pulsars @xmath12 and @xmath24 , and the kroenecker delta , @xmath25 , is unity if @xmath26 , and zero otherwise .",

    "measurements of correlations between pulsar timing datasets that are attributable to the effects of gws are necessary for the detection of gws with ptas @xcite .",
    "the prospect of detecting or constraining the amplitude of a background of gws from binary smbhs has been the primary rationale for the development of the pta concept .",
    "various works have placed upper bounds on the value of @xmath6 for a background with the characteristic strain spectral form of equation  1 @xcite .",
    "the best published upper bound @xcite finds that @xmath27 with 95% confidence .",
    "all analysis methods developed to study the combined gw signal from binary smbhs with ptas assume that the @xmath17 time - series for multiple pulsars can be described as a specific stochastic process .",
    "we describe the exact nature of this assumption in  2 .    in this paper , we elucidate the statistical nature of the toa variations induced by gws from binary smbhs .",
    "we accomplish this by modeling the gw signal from the predicted population of binary smbhs , and by simulating realizations of @xmath17 corresponding to realizations of the gw signal .",
    "this study is critical to the validity of interpreting published upper limits on @xmath6 as representative of limits on the mean characteristic strain spectrum of gws predicted to arise from binary smbhs .",

    "toa variations induced by gws from binary smbhs ( @xmath17 ) are commonly modeled among the pta community as a wide - sense stationary random gaussian process .",
    "this is based on the hypothesis that many gw sources forming a gw background contribute to the toa variations , resulting in a statistical process governed by the central limit theorem . while the nature of the random gaussian model for @xmath17 has been extensively described elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we summarize it here for completeness .",
    "the key property of a random gaussian process is that a linear combination of samples will have a joint normal distribution function .",
    "different samples need not be statistically independent .",
    "the distribution of samples from a ( zero - mean ) random gaussian process is characterized by the covariance matrix of the samples .",

    "as the gaussian process is wide - sense stationary , each element @xmath59 of @xmath61 depends only on the time difference @xmath62 between samples @xmath18 and @xmath63 for pulsar @xmath12 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "elements of @xmath57 are sampled from a covariance function , @xmath64 , between the gw - induced toa variations for pulsars @xmath12 and @xmath24 .",
    "this covariance function is defined by the inverse fourier transform of the one - sided psd , @xmath37 , of gw - induced toa variations for a given pulsar : @xmath65.\\ ] ] here , @xmath66 denotes a complex fourier transform , and @xmath67 is a time - lag .",
    "the psds of the gw - induced toa variations for all pulsars are equivalent , and given by @xcite @xmath68 for a gw signal with the expected characteristic strain spectrum @xmath4 .",
    "the above discussion applies equivalently if pulsar @xmath12 and pulsar @xmath24 are the same pulsar , or if they are different pulsars .",
    "the hellings & downs factor @xmath35 , defined in equation  4 , accounts for the correlation between gw - induced toa variations for different pulsars .",
    "if @xmath4 has the form in equation  1 , we have @xmath69 .",
    "the gw - induced toa variations for each pulsar will therefore be a `` red '' process . in this work ,",
    "we only consider time - series @xmath17 with finite lengths @xmath70 .",
    "we are interested in comparing a new model for @xmath17 with the random gaussian model described in this section . to this end",
    ", we need to be able to simulate realizations of @xmath17 as a random gaussian process .",
    "multiple pta groups test their data analysis algorithms by simulating realizations of @xmath17 using the gwbkgrd plugin @xcite to the tempo2 pulsar timing package @xcite .",
    "while this plugin does not explicitly generate random gaussian realizations of @xmath17 by construction , we and others @xcite have checked that it approximates a random gaussian process well .    in the plugin gwbkgrd , a number of gw oscillators , @xmath71 , are simulated between gw frequencies @xmath72 and @xmath73 , with the normally distributed @xmath74 and @xmath75 gw polarization amplitudes set to be purely real with zero mean , variance @xmath76 and frequency probability distribution , @xmath77 , given by @xmath78 toa variations calculated for a given pulsar @xmath12 at different times @xmath19 corresponding to gws from each of these oscillators are summed to produce a realization of the @xmath17 time - series . the frequency limits @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    "are generally chosen respectively to be much less than the @xmath79 and much greater than the nyquist frequency corresponding to the minimum sampling interval .",
    "we make a distinction between the expected psd of toa variations induced by gws from binary smbhs , as defined in equation  8 , and estimates of this psd based on realizations of the toa variations . a commonly - used non - parametric , unbiased estimator of the psd of a time - series is the periodogram @xcite .",

    "in this section , we describe a new method of simulating toa variations caused by gws from the predicted population of binary smbhs .",
    "various works have presented models for the cosmic demographics of binary smbhs @xcite .",
    "more recently , such efforts have been based on analytic prescriptions for baryon physics applied to dark matter halo merger tree catalogues from n - body simulations ( * ? ? ? * hereafter g11 ) . in particular , the g11 prescriptions were applied to merger trees from both the millennium @xcite and the millennium - ii @xcite simulations . the millennium and",
    "millennium - ii simulations follow the evolution of dark matter structures , using the same physical prescriptions and number of particles .",
    "the millennium - ii simulation was however carried out in a comoving cubic volume with one - fifth the side length as that of the millennium simulation , with the aim of resolving smaller - scale dark matter structures than the millennium simulation .",
    "together , these simulations resolve dark matter halos corresponding to the observed galaxy population , from dwarf galaxies to the largest - mass early - type galaxies .",
    "the g11 model is the latest in a series @xcite of semi - analytic prescriptions applied to the millennium simulations .",
    "a host of observables of galaxies at low redshifts are reproduced , along with the redshift - evolution of the quasar population and star formation .",
    "of most relevance here is that the model also traces the smbh population , reproducing the @xmath87 smbh - galaxy scaling relations in their slopes , normalization and scatters , as well as the inferred smbh mass function @xcite .",
    "we base our description of the binary smbh population emitting gws on the prediction for the smbh - smbh coalescence rate from the g11 model .",
    "we fit an analytic function to the distribution of binary smbhs , and randomly draw gw sources from this distribution to produce realizations of the gw sky corresponding to binary smbhs .",
    "we then add the effect of each gw source to simulated pulsar toa datasets in order to analyze the gw - induced toa variations .",
    "this work is different from previous attempts to model the gw signal from binary smbhs .",
    "initial attempts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to predict the mean gw characteristic strain spectrum from binary smbhs used empirical determinations of the galaxy merger rate and the smbh mass function .",
    "@xcite predicted the gw spectrum by analytically following the dark matter halo merger hierarchy in an extended press - schechter framework , and by deriving the smbh coalescence rate by relating the smbh masses to the halo circular velocities . @xcite considered the possible range of predictions of the characteristic strain spectrum , using monte carlo realizations of dark matter halo merger trees and various prescriptions for smbh growth .",
    "the key difference between the present work and previous calculations of the gw signal from binary smbhs is that we are chiefly concerned with the statistics of @xmath17 .",
    "our approach to modeling the binary smbh population is similar to @xcite in our use of mock galaxy catalogues derived from analytic prescriptions applied to the millennium simulations .",
    "however , whereas @xcite modeled the smbh population by using empirical smbh - galaxy scaling relations combined with ( earlier ) mock catalogues , we utilize smbhs modeled by g11 in a self - consistent framework which reproduces the relevant observables .      as in the previous works discussed above",
    ", we consider all binary smbhs to be in circular orbits , and use expressions for the resulting gw emission presented by @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss the assumption of circular orbits in  6.3 .",
    "the strain amplitude , @xmath88 , at frequency @xmath5 of gws from a circular binary , averaged over all orientations and polarizations , is given by : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath91 is the chirp mass of the binary , @xmath92 is the vacuum speed of light , @xmath93 is the redshift , and @xmath94 is the comoving distance to the binary .",
    "the evolution of the received gw frequency with observed time , @xmath15 , is determined by @xmath95 the rest - frame binary orbital frequency is given by @xmath96 .",
    "we assume , after @xcite , that the maximum received frequency , @xmath97 , is attained at a binary separation of three schwarzschild radii , corresponding to the last stable orbit : @xmath98 assuming a mass ratio of unity .",
    "the mock galaxy catalogues resulting from the g11 model are available online @xcite .",
    "the halo merger trees from the millennium and millennium - ii simulations were evaluated at 60 logarithmically - spaced redshift `` snapshots '' between @xmath87 and @xmath99 .",
    "we obtained the lists of smbh - smbh coalescence events within the comoving volume of each simulation by querying the online database .",
    "redshifts at the ( non - logarithmic ) midpoints between the redshift snapshots were assigned to each event .",
    "we used these lists to fill bins of a distribution , @xmath41 , of the number , @xmath100 , of observable binary smbhs per unit comoving volume per solid angle on the sky , given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the sky - integrated comoving volume shell between redshifts @xmath93 and @xmath104 .",
    "also , @xmath105 , and the derivative @xmath106 was obtained from equation  15 .",
    "@xmath41 is the predicted distribution of binary smbhs in @xmath40 ( which corresponds to the frequency - independent gw `` power '' , or squared strain amplitude ) and the observed gw frequency .    for chirp masses below @xmath107 , the limited capability of the millennium simulation to resolve low - mass halos caused an under - prediction of the chirp mass function as compared to the millennium - ii simulation . in order to ensure a complete chirp mass function , we included binary smbhs with @xmath108 from the millennium list of coalescence events , and binaries with @xmath109 from the millennium - ii list .",
    "some degrees of randomization in the coalescence lists were possible .",
    "first , in cases where more than two smbhs coalesced to form a single smbh between redshift snapshots , the merger order was not specified . in these instances we randomized over merger order .",
    "second , a spherical comoving volume shell between any pair of redshifts less than @xmath110 could be contained within the simulation volume .",
    "some millennium redshift snapshots exist at @xmath111 , and the comoving volume shells between redshifts corresponding to these snapshots enclose some smbh - smbh coalescence events in the g11 model .",
    "an observer located at the center of the millennium simulation volume would observe only a fraction of the total list of events in the g11 model at @xmath111 , and an observer located elsewhere in the volume would observe a different selection of events .",
    "this is not the case for the millennium - ii simulation , where the volume was too small to enclose any comoving volume shells between redshift snapshots . for each realization of the millennium ( but not the millennium - ii ) coalescence list , we therefore specified randomly - placed spherical shells within the simulation box to select binary smbhs at these redshifts . for coalescence events at @xmath112 ,",
    "the corresponding comoving volume shells between redshift snapshots were smaller than the millennium simulation volume , though not enclosed by it . for these coalescence events , we randomly included binaries in the millennium coalescence list according to probabilities given by the ratios between the volumes of the comoving shells and the millennium simulation volume .",
    "we used 1000 realizations of the millennium and millennium - ii coalescence lists to form realizations of the binary smbh distribution @xmath41 .    in generating realizations of the distribution @xmath41",
    ", we assumed that every smbh - smbh coalescence event in the g11 model catalogues was the result of a binary smbh system that had decayed through gw emission .",
    "the g11 model included the assumption that , upon the merger of two galaxies with central smbhs , the smbhs coalesced in every case , before accretion onto the newly - formed smbh .",
    "we note that smbhs with masses as low as @xmath113 were present in the g11 model catalogues , but were not included in the @xmath41 distributions .",
    "we verified that relaxing the lower cutoff on the smbh masses in the @xmath41 distributions from @xmath1 to @xmath113 did not significantly modify the total signal .",
    "the 1000 realizations of @xmath41 were averaged to form a distribution @xmath42 .",
    "we fitted @xmath42 with an analytic function which could be used to generate random realizations of the observable binary smbh population .",
    "we did not use realizations of @xmath41 as realizations of the binary smbh population because the @xmath41-distributions were binned for computational purposes .",
    "a four - parameter function , @xmath114 with free parameters @xmath52 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , was found to fit @xmath42 well .",
    "we performed the fit on the logarithm of the data to approximate linearity in the fitting procedure .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  2 .",
    "the frequency - exponent was held fixed at @xmath118 , as predicted by equations 15 and 17 .",
    "for a set of binary smbhs drawn from the distribution @xmath43 , we simulated a corresponding time - series @xmath17 by summing the contributions from each individual binary .",
    "details of the method used to calculate these contributions are presented in @xcite . for each binary , we randomized over the right ascension and declination , the orbital inclination angle , the orientation of the line of nodes , and the orbital phase angle at the line of nodes . a new publicly - available tempo2 plugin , `` addallsmbhbs '' ,",
    "was written to perform this simulation .    for most of the present work ,",
    "we did not use tempo2 to fit timing model parameters .",
    "instead , we made use of the tools available for spectral analysis of timing residuals . in our simulations ,",
    "the `` timing residuals '' corresponded exactly to @xmath17 given the absence of timing model fitting .",
    "we consider it important to emphasize the distinction between the @xmath17 time - series and the timing residuals resulting from analyses of observed toa datasets .",
    "consider a set of observed toas that exactly match a particular timing model , except for the addition of gw - induced variations ( a @xmath17 time - series ) .",
    "given that an observer does not actually possess any prior knowledge of the timing model parameters , the observer will fit the model parameters to the toas .",
    "the resulting timing residuals will not be equivalent to @xmath17 .",
    "this is because the @xmath17 variations in the toas can alter the apparent pulsar timing parameters .",
    "for example , the presence of a @xmath17 time - series consisting of a sinusoidal signal with a period of one year will alter the apparent pulsar position .    in order to investigate the statistics of @xmath17",
    "given our model for the binary smbh population , we first used tempo2 to generate 500 toas spanning 5 years exactly corresponding to the psr j0437@xmath1194715 timing model @xcite .",
    "we then added realizations of the @xmath17 time - series evaluated at the observed toas to these datasets , that is , with @xmath120yr and @xmath121yr .",
    "the pulsar distance was set to 1kpc , and the position was held fixed for all simulations . as the binary smbhs used to produce realizations of @xmath17 had randomized positions and orientations , allowing the pulsar position to vary between realizations would not alter our results .",
    "the results presented in this paper are not dependent on the timing model used or on the pulsar distance from the earth .",
    "we also added gaussian white noise variations with 1ns rms to the toas .",
    "this white noise component is much smaller than is usually observed in toa datasets , but was necessary to smooth over machine precision errors .",

    "in particular , @xcite randomized over the existence of `` fractional '' sources in every frequency bin of a fiducial dataset , and also excluded the strongest single source in every frequency bin in an attempt to isolate the background signal . the smaller number of sources per unit frequency at higher gw frequencies , combined with the greater contributions to the signal from the strongest single sources in frequency bins at higher frequencies , both resulted in the curved characteristic strain spectra presented by @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  2 shows the mean numbers of highest-@xmath40 sources that contribute 90% and 50% of @xmath44 in these frequency bins .",

    "we compare the millennium - based simulations of @xmath17 with simulations of @xmath17 created using the tempo2 method described in  2 . to this end , we simulated toas as before , but added realizations of @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath147 oscillators simulated using the tempo2 plugin gwbkgrd .",
    "these oscillators were simulated as described in  2 with a mean characteristic strain spectrum given by @xmath45 .",
    "we refer to this latter method of simulating @xmath17 as case h09 , after @xcite .",
    "simulations of @xmath17 using gw sources drawn from @xmath43 will be referred to as case r12 after the present work .",
    "in this section , we consider the differences between the cases in the distributions of the periodograms , @xmath38 , evaluated for realizations of @xmath17 for a single pulsar .",
    "this is motivated by the results in figure  2 , in particular that the number of gw sources per spectral bin that contribute 90% of @xmath44 varies significantly with frequency .",
    "the case r12 simulations are intended to more accurately represent the effects of gws from binary smbhs on toa datasets than the case h09 simulations .",
    "example realizations of 5-year @xmath17 time - series in both cases are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the time - series appear quite similar : realizations in both cases are dominated by low - frequency components .",
    "values of up to 1@xmath154s are also present in one realization .    instead of directly measuring @xmath38 , the added white noise component in the simulated toas required us to analyze the periodograms of a time - series , @xmath47 , given by @xmath155 where @xmath46 is a time - series of gaussian white 1ns rms toa variations as discussed above .",
    "the psd of @xmath17 , @xmath44 , is significantly red , with a spectral index of @xmath156 ( see equations 1 , 20 ) , and is expected to dominate the psd of @xmath46 at low frequencies .",
    "we used the generalized least - squares algorithm described in @xcite to measure the periodograms , @xmath49 of realizations of @xmath47 .",
    "this method requires knowledge of the auto - covariance function of @xmath47 , which we obtained as in equation  7 using the inverse dft of the known psd of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , given by @xmath157 in the following , we consider the distributions of @xmath49 in the lower spectral bins , where @xmath158 , to be approximately equivalent to the distributions of @xmath38 .",
    "we produced 1000 realizations of @xmath47 in case r12 and in case h09 , and measured @xmath49 for each realization . in the top panel of figure  4 , we show the averages of @xmath49 measured from each of the case r12 and case h09 realizations , along with the expected psds of @xmath17 and @xmath46 .",
    "arbitrarily chosen single realizations of @xmath49 in each case are also shown .",
    "the means of the periodograms in both cases are clearly the same , and equivalent to the predicted psd , @xmath48 , given in equation  24 .",
    "though this is as expected , it is both a check of the simulations of @xmath47 , and a demonstration of the ability of our psd estimation method to measure steep red spectra without bias .",
    "in contrast , the distributions of @xmath49 in the frequency bins where @xmath158 are different between the cases .",
    "the single realizations of @xmath49 in each case shown in the top panel of figure  4 begin to hint at these differences . in most spectral bins ,",
    "the case r12 periodogram is below the case h09 periodogram . that this is a genuine trend",
    "is confirmed in the bottom panel of figure  4 .",
    "here , we depict various `` percentile '' periodograms of the distributions of @xmath49 in each of case r12 and case h09 . the percentile periodograms may be interpreted as contours of equivalent percentiles of the periodogram distributions in different spectral bins .",
    "for example , the `` 50% '' percentile periodogram links the 50th percentile points of the distributions of periodogram values in each spectral bin . below the 95th percentile ,",
    "all case r12 percentile periodograms lie below case h09 percentile periodograms .",
    "this implies that in most spectral bins , most measurements of a periodogram in case r12 will , like the individual ones shown in the top panel of figure  4 , be below most case h09 periodograms .",
    "however , the 95th percentile periodograms are essentially equivalent , and the maximum value case r12 periodogram is well above the maximum value case h09 periodogram .",
    "these implied `` tails '' at high values in the case r12 periodogram distributions in each spectral bin are highlighted in figure  5 , which depicts the distributions of the @xmath49 in the spectral bins indicated by the vertical lines in the bottom panel of figure  4 .",
    "the distributions are shown as the fractions of case r12 and case h09 periodograms at or above a given value .",
    "figure  5 also shows that the case r12 periodogram distribution in the @xmath159 spectral bin has a longer tail relative to the case h09 distribution , as compared to the @xmath150 spectral bin .",
    "this effect is also evident in the bottom panel of figure  4 , in that the fractional differences between the percentile periodograms are greater at the upper end of the gw - dominated frequency regime .",
    "this is consistent with the number of gw sources per spectral bin included in the case r12 simulations going down with increasing frequency , as shown in figure  2 .    in summary , approximating @xmath49 with @xmath38 as discussed above , we find that :    * in most spectral bins , most realizations of @xmath38 in case r12 will be below most realizations of @xmath38 in case h09 .",
    "* the maximum possible values of @xmath38 in case r12 will be higher than the maximum possible values of @xmath38 in case h09 .",
    "@xcite showed that the _ average _ values of correlations between @xmath17 for different pulsars , for a stochastic gw signal , will always be given by the hellings & downs curve ( equation  4 ) .",
    "the distributions of individual estimates of these correlations , much like the distributions of the psd estimator @xmath38 considered above , will however depend on the nature of the gw signal . here",
    ", we characterize the distributions of estimates of these correlations for multiple pulsar pairs in each case discussed above .",
    "we simulated 100 realizations of each of case h09 and case r12 toas as described in  3.2 for pulsars at the positions of each of the 20 pulsars timed by the parkes pta , using the timing models specific to each pulsar @xcite .",
    "for each realization , the same set of gw sources was used to simulate gw - induced toa variations for each pulsar .",
    "the pulsar distances were set arbitrarily between 1kpc and 20kpc .",
    "we estimated the correlations between time - series @xmath17 and @xmath36 , @xmath35 , for each pulsar pair @xmath160 in each realization of case r12 and case h09 toas .",
    "no autocorrelations were estimated .",
    "a frequency - domain estimation technique , based on the method of @xcite , was used .",
    "this technique will be detailed elsewhere ( hobbs et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we refer to our estimates of @xmath35 as @xmath50 .",
    "these estimates were performed using @xmath47 time - series , rather than @xmath17 time - series ( see equation  23 ) , and the estimation technique was optimized using the expected psd of @xmath47 given in equation  24 .",
    "the technique removes best - fit linear and quadratic terms from each @xmath47 time - series using the standard tempo2 least - squares fitting algorithm .",
    "this mimics the effect of fitting pulse frequency and frequency - derivative terms to the simulated toas and then analyzing the timing residuals .    following the removal of linear and quadratic terms from one of the 100 case r12 realizations of @xmath47",
    ", a single gw source was found to dominate the residual time - series .",
    "we show the corresponding @xmath47 time - series for two of the 20 simulated pulsars for this realization in figure  6 .",
    "the left panel of this figure shows the large sinusoidal oscillations induced by the source , and the right panel shows example case r12 realizations of @xmath47 that are not dominated by an individual source .",
    "it is possible that an individual gw source with a period greater than the 5-year dataspan could dominate the realizations of @xmath47 in the right - hand panel of figure  6 .",
    "the toa variations induced by such a source would however be absorbed in the removal of the linear and quadratic terms from the @xmath47 time - series .",
    "we averaged all measurements of @xmath50 for each pulsar pair @xmath160 from the case r12 realizations , besides the one clearly dominated by an individual source .",
    "the realization dominated by an individual source added a large amount of scatter to the average case r12 correlations , and was left out of the average to enable a better comparison between the cases .",
    "we also averaged the case h09 measurements of @xmath50 for each pair @xmath160 in 99 arbitrarily - chosen realizations .",
    "the average measurements of @xmath50 are shown for both cases in figure  7 .",
    "the functional form of the hellings & downs curve is recovered in both case r12 and case h09 .",
    "however , the case r12 estimates are significantly more scattered about the expected values of the correlations than the case h09 estimates .",
    "the increased scatter in the case r12 correlations with respect to the case h09 correlations in figure  7 is caused by outlying estimates in only a few realizations of toas .",
    "this is shown in figure  8 , where we display the histograms of the @xmath50 measurements between simulated toa datasets for psr j0437@xmath1194715 and psr j0613@xmath1190200 in each case .",
    "correlation estimates @xmath161 were possible because we normalized the estimated covariances between @xmath47 time - series using the expected cross - psd between the time - series . while most measurements in both cases are concentrated about the expected value of @xmath35 , a few case r12 measurements are significantly displaced .",
    "this is consistent with the results of  4 .",
    "we also stress that the large scatter of the estimator common to both cases is expected , and intrinsic to the gw signal .",
    "we have shown that the toa variations induced by gws from the predicted binary smbh population are not consistent with the model described in  2 .",
    "the random gaussian model for @xmath17 described in  2 and approximated in case h09 is reasonable given that a large number of gw sources are expected to contribute to the gw - induced toa variations .",
    "that is , the values of @xmath17 at all times @xmath19 are the sums of many random variables .",
    "an argument based on the classical central limit theorem would suggest that @xmath17 would then be gaussian random at every time @xmath19 .",
    "it is apparent , however , that such a central limit theorem - based argument does not apply to the case r12 realizations of @xmath17 .",
    "this is because of the nature of the gw sources contributing to @xmath17 in case r12 .    in case r12 ,",
    "a few sources contribute most of the psd of @xmath17 at every frequency , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "these sources are rare , because they are found at the high-@xmath40 tail of the @xmath43 source distribution .",
    "the estimators we consider in this work , @xmath38 and @xmath50 , are dominated in case r12 by a few gw sources that need not occur in every realization of the @xmath17 time - series .",
    "this is why the distributions of these estimators are different between the cases .",
    "the quantities that we estimate , @xmath37 and @xmath35 , are used to define the covariance matrix of the gw - induced toa variations ( see equation  7 ) .",
    "we have therefore shown that the toa variations induced by gws from binary smbhs are dominated by the effects of a few strong , rare sources and can not be accurately modeled using the random gaussian process discussed in  2 .",
    "current pta data analysis techniques use assumptions about the statistics of @xmath17 to attempt to estimate or constrain the amplitude of the characteristic strain spectrum of gws from binary smbhs .",
    "we consider the implications of our results for a selection of techniques in turn .",
    "we assume , in this discussion , that our results for the statistics of gw - induced toa variations would apply even if the normalization of the gw characteristic strain spectrum @xmath45 , which we refer to as the gw amplitude , parameter introduced in equation  1 , because @xmath45 does not have exactly the same form as given in equation  1 . ]",
    "were scaled up or down .",
    "such a scaling could occur , for example , under different scenarios for whether coalescing smbhs accrete gas before or after coalescence @xcite .",
    "we summarize a few key techniques here :    * @xcite describe a statistic which measures the degree of correlation between estimates of @xmath35 from toa data , and the expected functional form of @xmath35 .",
    "the expected detection significance , which is estimated under the assumption that the gw - induced toa variations are gaussian random , saturates at high values of the gw amplitude once the variance of the statistic is dominated by the stochasticity of the gw signal ( see our figure  8 and related discussion ) .",
    "* @xcite constrain the amplitude of the gw characteristic strain spectrum from binary smbhs by estimating the maximum possible gw signal present in measured data , under the assumption that the data could be modeled using a white noise process and gw - induced toa variations . a statistic that estimates the gw background amplitude from individual pulsars",
    "was measured , and compared to the simulated distributions of the statistic for different gw amplitudes .",
    "the simulated statistic distributions were created from simulated toa datasets with gw - induced toa variations included using the tempo2 plugin gwbkgrd . *",
    "@xcite present a bayesian parameter estimation method for the gw characteristic strain spectral amplitude .",
    "@xcite used this method to constrain the gw amplitude .",
    "this method requires an evaluation of the likelihood of the parameters used to model the toa datasets , which include the gw amplitude .",
    "the likelihood is the probability distribution of the data given the model parameters .",
    "the gw amplitude is used to calculate the covariance matrix , @xmath57 , between the gw - induced toa variations for pulsars @xmath12 and @xmath24 ( see equations 7 , 8) . this covariance matrix in turn is used to define the pta likelihood , assuming that the gw - induced toa variations can be modeled as a random gaussian process . * @xcite use a pta likelihood similar to the work of @xcite to constrain the gw amplitude by evaluating the distribution of a maximum likelihood estimator for the amplitude .",
    "they also use a method similar in concept to @xcite to attempt to detect the gw signal from binary smbhs .",
    "first , the non - gaussianity of the gw - induced toa variations means that the estimate of the intrinsic gw - induced variance of the @xcite statistic will be incorrect .",
    "this will affect estimates of the detection significance , particularly in the `` strong signal regime '' , where the effects of gws in the toas are large compared to all other noise processes .",
    "second , the limit on the gw amplitude placed by @xcite will be biased .",
    "the @xcite limit was placed by finding the gw amplitude for which 95% of simulated statistic values were above the measured value .",
    "the distribution of their statistic derived using our simulations would be different .",
    "ruling out a gw amplitude using the @xcite technique does not necessarily rule out a gw signal corresponding to our simulations with the same confidence .",
    "finally , our results indicate that the likelihoods evaluated by @xcite and @xcite will also be biased , leading to a similar effect on gw amplitude constraints made using their methods . a definitive statement on the magnitude of the consequences of our simulations for current constraints on the gw amplitude",
    "can not be made , however , without fully considering the various pta data analysis methods .",
    "we have established that in every frequency bin of the 5-year datasets we consider , a few strong gw sources dominate the psd of @xmath17 .",
    "this means that we can not consider the expected gw signal from binary smbhs to form a background .",
    "we briefly consider the prospects for there being single sources of gws that are detectable by ptas .",
    "various methods of detecting and characterising individual continuous sources of gws with ptas have recently been presented @xcite .",
    "there are , however , few predictions for the expected numbers of detectable sources .",
    "@xcite analysed similar binary smbh population models to those considered here to suggest that a 5-year toa dataset would include 5@xmath11910 single gw sources above the mean `` stochastic background '' level , mainly at gw frequencies greater than @xmath162hz . their definition of a _",
    "resolvable _ source as one which has a ( mean ) strain amplitude that is greater than the mean background level is conservative .",
    "this is because a pta is capable of spatial , as well as frequency resolution .",
    "the background contribution per spatial resolution element of a pta will be less than the all - sky background level , resulting in a higher source amplitude to background ratio for a bright source located in the resolution element .    the exact number of resolvable gw sources given a gw background level for ptas depends on the particular search method .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that a pta composed of @xmath100 pulsars could resolve up to @xmath163 sources per frequency bin . in figure  9",
    ", we present a simple indication of the expected amplitudes of strong individual sources in the @xmath164 spectral bins of our fiducial 5-year dataset . using 300 case r12 realizations of the gw source population , we found the mean strain amplitudes in each spectral bin of the strongest three gw sources .",
    "we express these amplitudes as multiples of the mean summed strain amplitude , @xmath165 , of the remaining sources .",
    "the errors in the @xmath165 values were not included in the error bars as they were very small .    if we consider the sources besides the strongest three in a spectral bin to form a `` background , '' it is clear that , for spectral bins with @xmath166 , three sources , on average , produce the same total strain amplitude as the remaining sources . even for the @xmath150 spectral bin ,",
    "three sources are expected to produce more than half the total strain amplitude of the remaining sources .",
    "indeed , the strongest source in the @xmath150 spectral bin has an average strain amplitude that is @xmath167 , which implies that a pta which can resolve out two - thirds of the sky will detect equal contributions from the source and from the background .",
    "blind searches for single gw sources with ptas are therefore important .",
    "pta data analysis methods that attempt to detect an isotropic component will not optimally recover the entirety of the gw signal from binary smbhs , and could perhaps miss a large component of the signal for some realizations of the gw source population .",
    "a careful consideration of the efficacy of gw background detection methods as compared to search methods for single sources , given the predicted source characteristics , is required .",
    "a shortcoming of our approach towards modeling @xmath17 , and indeed of all predictions for the gw signal from binary smbhs to date , is the assumption of circular orbits for all binaries .",
    "recent work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that binary smbhs emitting gws in the pta frequency regime will have highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the candidate binary smbh oj287 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is in fact modeled with an orbital eccentricity of @xmath1680.7 .",
    "the gw waveform of an eccentric binary radiating in the pta band spans many frequencies , and does not follow the frequency - time relation of equation  15 , or the dependence of the gw strain amplitude on frequency of equation  14 . therefore ,",
    "if most binary smbhs radiating in the pta band are eccentric , the predicted mean spectral slope of the characteristic strain spectrum ( equation  1 ) will change .",
    "we will also need to account for the binary eccentricity distribution in our predictions of the statistics of gw - induced toa variations .",
    "other effects that require further investigation are the effects of gas and stars on binaries .",
    "we do not include these effects in our model because the understanding of their combined contributions towards specifying the binary smbh population is not sufficiently advanced .",
    "we have used a sophisticated model for galaxy evolution @xcite to predict the distribution of binary smbhs radiating gws in the pta frequency band . by drawing lists of gw sources from this distribution",
    ", we simulate the effects of gws from binary smbhs on 5-year pulsar toa datasets .",
    "we compare these simulations ( case r12 ) with simulated pulsar datasets containing the effects of an equivalent - amplitude gw signal modeled as a random gaussian process ( case h09 ) .",
    "we estimate the psds of the simulated gw - induced toa variation time - series , and the correlations between these time - series for different pulsars .",
    "we find that the distributions of the psd estimators of the realizations of the gw - induced toa variations are different between the cases in every frequency bin , although the mean estimated psds are the same in each case .",
    "while in case r12 the estimated psds are concentrated at lower values than in case h09 , the case r12 estimations extend to higher psd values than the case h09 estimations .",
    "we also find that the functional form of the hellings & downs curve is recovered on average in both cases .",
    "the correlations between the gw - induced toa variation time - series for different pulsars in case r12 are , however , significantly more scattered about the expected values than in case h09 .",
    "we interpret our results in terms of the influence of strong individual gw sources on the toas in case r12 .      1 .   the effects of gws from binary smbhs on pulsar toas",
    "can not be accurately modeled using existing methods , i.e , as a random gaussian process .",
    "this is because a few gw sources dominate the psd of the gw - induced toa variations at all frequencies , with reducing numbers of sources contributing equivalent psd fractions in higher frequency bins .",
    "our results directly affect existing pta data analysis methods aimed at detecting or estimating the parameters of the gw signal from binary smbhs .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of gravitational waves ( gws ) from a simulated population of binary super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) on pulsar timing array datasets . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a distribution describing the binary smbh population from an existing semi - analytic galaxy formation model . using realizations of the binary smbh population generated from this distribution , </S>",
    "<S> we simulate pulsar timing datasets with gw - induced variations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the statistics of these variations do not correspond to an isotropic , stochastic gw background . </S>",
    "<S> the `` hellings & downs '' correlations between simulated datasets for different pulsars are recovered on average , though the scatter of the correlation estimates is greater than expected for an isotropic , stochastic gw background . </S>",
    "<S> these results are attributable to the fact that just a few gw sources dominate the gw - induced variations in every fourier frequency bin of a 5-year dataset . </S>",
    "<S> current constraints on the amplitude of the gw signal from binary smbhs will be biased . </S>",
    "<S> individual binary systems are likely to be detectable in 5-year pulsar timing array datasets where the noise is dominated by gw - induced variations </S>",
    "<S> . searches for gws in pulsar timing array data therefore need to account for the effects of individual sources of gws . </S>"
