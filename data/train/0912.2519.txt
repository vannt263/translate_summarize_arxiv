    "cavity polaritons are mixed states of light and matter formed as a result of the strong coupling of quantum well excitons with the photonic mode in the microcavity which embraces the quantum well .",
    "exciton - polaritons demonstrate a wide range of spectacular phenomena caused by the combination of photonic and excitonic properties  @xcite . among those are spin effects related with an interplay of the exciton spin and photon polarization degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the polaritonic spin states are characterized by a projection of the angular momentum on the growth axis which can be either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the states with a definite angular momentum projection emit circularly polarized light , and their linear combinations correspond to the elliptically polarized light , in general .",
    "it is convenient to describe the spin dynamics of cavity polaritons in the framework of the ( pseudo)spin bloch vector whose @xmath2 component describes the circular polarization degree and in - plane components determine orientation of the linear polarization plane .",
    "a driving force for polariton spin dynamics is the spin splitting of their energy dispersion .",
    "acting as a wave vector dependent effective magnetic field similar to the dresselhaus or rashba terms in the electron effective hamiltonian it induces the spin precession of cavity polaritons which may be directly observed by time - resolved photoluminescence and faraday rotation experimental techniques  @xcite . the powerful tool to visualize the polariton spin precession and spin splitting is the optical spin hall effect which consists in the linear - to - circular polarization conversion in microcavities  @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of the circular polarization degree carries information on the magnitude and the direction of an effective magnetic field acting on the polariton spin  @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the spin splitting of the polariton states can result from the longitudinal - transverse ( te - tm ) splitting of the cavity mode  @xcite .",
    "this splitting is strongly wavevector dependent , and it has a symmetry of second angular harmonics because the polariton spin flip is accompanied by the angular momentum change by @xmath3 . another contribution to the spin splitting can be caused by the in - plane anisotropy of the microcavity which results in the splitting of the modes polarized along two perpendicular in - plane axes  @xcite .",
    "an interplay of the longitudinal - transverse and anisotropic splittings can strongly affect the spin dynamics of cavity polaritons  @xcite .",
    "coherent effects are also very sensitive to the fine , spin - dependent structure of their energy spectrum , for review see ref .   and references therein .",
    "it was demonstrated recently that the presence of longitudinal - transverse splitting strongly affects the weak localization of exciton polaritons : the coherent backscattering can be reduced in the presence of the polariton spin splitting  @xcite .",
    "so far , an analytical theory of polariton dynamics in the presence of both te - tm and anisotropic splittings is absent .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the theoretical study of an interplay between the longitudinal - transverse and anisotropic splittings in spin dynamics and transport properties of cavity polaritons .",

    "there are two important limiting cases where the spin dynamics in microcavities is most brightly pronounced : the excitation of a given state @xmath42",
