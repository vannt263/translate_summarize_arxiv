    "mesoscopic circuits with ferromagnetic elements are generating a growing interest , both for the fundamentally new effects they can exhibit due to the lifting of spin - degeneracy , and for the possibilities of technological advances , e.g. towards nanospintronics@xcite . the description of the interface between ferromagnetic and non - magnetic elements is crucial to understand the behavior of these devices . obviously , one first has to take into account the spin - polarization of the electronic transmission probabilities through the interfaces , a property which generates the widely known magnetoresistance effects@xcite .",
    "importantly , the phases of the scattering amplitudes also depend on the spin in general .",
    "this so - called spin - dependence of interfacial phase shifts ( sdips ) is less frequently taken into account .",
    "however , the sdips has already been found to affect the behavior of many different types of mesoscopic conductors with ferromagnetic leads , like diffusive normal metal islands @xcite , resonant systems @xcite , coulomb blockade systems@xcite , or luttinger liquids@xcite .",
    "the sdips can also have numerous types of consequences in superconducting / ferromagnetic ( @xmath0 ) hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "it can e.g. produce effective field effects in superconducting electrodes@xcite , or a phase shift of the spatial oscillations of the superconducting correlations induced by the proximity effect in a diffusive @xmath1 electrode@xcite .",
    "the sdips has also been predicted to induce triplet correlations in a @xmath2 electrode in contact with several ferromagnetic insulators with non - collinear polarization directions@xcite .",
    "recently , mean current measurements through @xmath0 quantum points contacts ( qpcs ) have raised much interest as a possible means to determine the polarization of a @xmath1 material .",
    "however , the effects of the sdips in these devices have not raised much attention so far . in most cases ,",
    "the experimental results were interpreted in terms of a generalization of the blonder - tinkham - klapwick ( btk ) model@xcite to the spin - dependent case @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the description of a @xmath0 interface in terms of a delta - function barrier naturally includes a finite sdips but does not allow one to analyze its effects separately .",
    "moreover , the sdips included in the generalized btk model is specific for the delta - function barrier , and for a more realistic interface potential the sdips can be different .",
    "this is the reason why the influence of the transmission probabilities and of the sdips have to be investigated separately .",
    "the scattering approach seems perfectly adapted for this purpose since it allows to account explicitly for scattering phases@xcite . in a few works , current transport through @xmath0 qpcs was described with a single - channel scattering description@xcite .",
    "however , the sdips was not taken into account in these works .    in this article , we study how the conductance and the current noise through a single channel @xmath0 qpc are affected by the sdips , using a scattering approach .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the current noise in hybrid @xmath0 systems has draw little attention so far@xcite , although it can provide more information on the system considered .",
    "we find that the behavior of the qpc depends on its spin - dependent normal state transmission probabilities @xmath3 , but also on the difference @xmath4 between the normal state reflection phases of up spins and down spins against @xmath1 .",
    "the device is thus more difficult to characterize than in the spin - degenerate case since there are two more parameters to determine , i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "we show that a finite sdips @xmath6 can strongly modify the behavior of the qpc , for instance by shifting the andreev peaks appearing in the qpc conductance to subgap voltages , as found by zhao et al . for @xmath7 quantum point contacts@xcite , or by producing subgap peaks or dips in the differential fano factor curves . at finite temperatures",
    ", we find that the sdips - induced shift of the andreev peaks in the conductance can be difficult to distinguish from a gap reduction .",
    "we show that , in this context , a noise measurement can be very useful to characterize better the contact properties .",
    "this is particularly clear in cases where the qpc differential fano factor versus bias voltage is qualitatively modified by the sdips while the conductance curve remains similar to the curves obtained without a sdips .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii.a introduces expressions of the conductance and noise of a @xmath0 interface in the scattering formalism , section ii.b presents an explicit expression of the scattering matrix of a single channel @xmath0 qpc , section ii.c discusses the conductance and noise of this qpc at zero temperature , and section ii.d discusses the finite temperature case . section iii concludes .",
    "we consider a superconducting / ferromagnetic ( @xmath0 ) interface with @xmath2 a conventional bcs conductor with a s - wave symmetry .",
    "we assume that the @xmath2 and @xmath1 leads can be considered as ballistic , so that the @xmath0 interface can be described with the scattering approach@xcite and the leads with bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations@xcite .",
    "we use a gauge transformation to set the origin of the quasiparticles energies to the fermi level of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath8@xcite . due to the bias voltage @xmath9 applied to the qpc",
    ", the fermi level of @xmath1 is @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the absolute value of the electron charge . in the following",
    ", we will denote by @xmath12 electron states with spin @xmath13 and by @xmath14 hole states in the @xmath15 spin band , with @xmath16 a spin component collinear to the polarization of @xmath1 . a hole @xmath14 corresponding to an empty electronic state at an energy @xmath17 carries the same energy @xmath18 as an electron @xmath12 occupying a state with energy @xmath18 .",
    "these two types of quasiparticles are coupled by andreev reflection processes occurring at the @xmath0 interface .",

    "this feature never appears in the absence of a sdips .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the conductance @xmath58 and noise @xmath2 of a superconducting / ferromagnetic ( @xmath0 ) single channel quantum point contact ( qpc ) as a function of the qpc bias voltage @xmath9 , using a scattering approach .",
    "we have shown that the spin - dependence of interfacial phase shifts ( sdips ) acquired by electrons at the @xmath0 interface strongly modifies these signals .",
    "in particular , for a weakly transparent contact , the sdips produces unusual sub - gap resonances or dips in the @xmath161 and @xmath178 curves .",
    "we have shown that measuring the noise should help to gain information on the system .",
    "this fact is well illustrated e.g. by cases where the sdips modifies qualitatively the zero - frequency noise but not the conductance .    one should note that , so far , experiments on @xmath0 quantum point contacts were performed in the multichannel limit .",
    "although single - channel contacts were already realized in the @xmath80 case@xcite , this seems more difficult in the @xmath0 case with the present fabrication techniques .",
    "a multichannel theory should thus be very useful . for a multichannel disordered @xmath80 qpc , ref .",
    "has shown that , due to time reversal symmetry , the eigenstates the qpc normal state scattering matrix are also those of @xmath102 . as a consequence ,",
    "the multichannel generalization of @xmath161 and @xmath178 just requires a summation on the normal channels index . in the @xmath0 case , the calculation should be more complicated because time reversal symmetry breaking suppresses the normal channels independence @xcite .",
    "so far , the multichannel case has been addressed with the btk model , in which the hypothesis of a specular interface allows one to consider the normal channels as independent in spite of the time reversal symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "however , this approach lacks of generality since it imposes a particular relation between the transmission probabilities and the sdips parameters , and it is not valid for disordered interfaces .",

    "however , to our knowledge , the multichannel @xmath0 case has not been studied with a more general approach so far .",
    "our work suggests that such a study should take into account the sdips .",
    "considering that , even in the single channel case , the conductance and noise of the device vary nonlinearly with the sdips parameter ( see e.g. eq . [ thesingle ] ) , there is no reason to expect that the effects of the sdips average out in the multichannel case , even in the extreme case of a sdips parameter @xmath195 randomly distributed with the channel index @xmath196 .",
