    "since the first observation of the flavor  changing neutral current induced decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 by cleo @xcite , the rare b - meson decays have begun to play a more important role in the particle physics phenomenology .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that as these processes only occur at loop level in the weak interaction , they provide fertile testing ground for the gauge sector of the sm .",
    "in addition , these decays can also serve as a good probe for establishing new physics beyond the sm .    from experimental point of view",
    ", studying rare @xmath3 meson decays can provide essential information about the poorly known parameters of the sm , such as the elements of the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , the leptonic decay constants etc . in this connection ,",
    "the pure leptonic b decays @xmath4 could be used to get such information .",
    "however , these decays are proportional to the lepton mass , so that they are helicity suppressed with the factor of @xmath5 , having the branching ratios of @xmath6 @xcite . for @xmath7 channel",
    ", there is no such suppression and @xmath8 @xcite , but this time the difficulty arises from their experimental observation due to the low efficiency . as for the @xmath9 decay , it is obviously forbidden in the sm due to the helicity conservation if neutrino is massless .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath10 decays can be considered as potential processes to determine the above - mentioned constants , especially the leptonic decay constant @xmath11 , since its branching ratio ( br ) quadratically depends on this constant .",
    "due to the additional the photon emission in @xmath12 , the helicity suppression is removed , as in @xmath13 decay , so that larger br is expected .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath14 is of the order of @xmath15 and it has very clear experimental signature , i.e. , the `` missing mass '' and isolated photon so that they are among the potentially measurable decays in the near future .    in this paper",
    ", we will use the light cone qcd sum rules method to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements and study the rare @xmath16 decay in a general model independent way by taking into account the polarization effects of the photon .",
    "@xmath10 decay has been investigated in the sm , using the constituent quark model and pole models @xcite for the determination of the leptonic decay constants @xmath17 . in @xcite , this process",
    "was studied also within the framework of the light cone qcd sum rules method , but there neutrino was assumed to be massless and the hamiltonian consisted of a single term representing the four vector interactions of the left handed neutrinos only .",
    "however , the super kamiokande @xcite results indicated that neutrino had mass so that it could have right components",
    ". therefore , in our work , we use a most general model independent effective hamiltonian , which contains the scalar and tensor type interactions as well as the vector types ( see eq.([effh ] ) below ) .",
    "we note that this mode has been studied in a recent work @xcite in a similar way to our analysis and shown that the spectrum is sensitive to the types of the interactions so that it is useful to discriminate the various new physics effects .    in a radiative decay mode like ours ,",
    "the final state photon can emerge with a definite polarization and studying the effects of polarized photon may provide another kinematical variable , in addition to the differential and total branching ratios for radiative decays @xcite .",
    "although experimental measurement of this variable would be much more difficult than that of e.g. , polarization of the final leptons in @xmath13 decay , this is still another kinematical variable for studying radiative decays . in this work",
    "we will investigate sensitivity of such `` photon polarization asymmetry '' in @xmath18 decay to the new wilson coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian and the parametrization of the hadronic matrix elements in terms of appropriate form factors .",
    "we then calculate the differential decay width and the photon polarization asymmetry for the @xmath19 decay when the photon is in positive and negative helicity states .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussion of our results .",
    "for the semileptonic @xmath0 decay , the basic quark level process is @xmath21 , which can be written in terms of 10 model independent four  fermi interactions in the following form @xcite-@xcite : [ effh ] h_eff & = & \\ { c_ll^tot |s _ ( 1-_5 ) b |^(1-_5)+ c_lr^tot |s _ ( 1-_5 ) b |^(1+_5 ) + & & + c_rl |s _ ( 1+_5)b |^(1-_5)+ c_rr |s _ ( 1+_5)b |^(1+_5 ) + & & + c_lrlr |s ( 1+_5 ) b |(1+_5 ) + c_rllr |s ( 1-_5 ) b |(1+_5 ) + & & + c_lrrl |s(1+_5 ) b |(1-_5 ) + c_rlrl |s ( 1-_5 ) b |(1-_5 ) + & & + c_t |s _ b",
    "|^+i c_te^ |s _ b | _ }  , where @xmath22 are the coefficients of the four  fermi interactions with @xmath23 describing vector , @xmath24 scalar and @xmath25 tensor type interactions .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 already exist in the sm in the form @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the @xmath30 decay , while for @xmath31 transition , we have @xmath32 @xcite with x(x_t ) & = & + x_1(x_t ) . here , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which gives about @xmath35 contribution to @xmath36 ,",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "now , writing c_ll^tot & = & 2 x(x_t ) + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot & = & c_lr  , we see that @xmath37 contains the contributions from the sm and also from the new physics .",
    "we note that the wilson coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq.([effh ] ) describe the scalar type interactions , which do not contribute for the @xmath0 processes .",
    "the next step is , starting with the hamiltonian in eq.([effh ] ) , to calculate the @xmath0 decay at hadronic level .",
    "we already note that the pure leptonic decay @xmath42 is forbidden due to helicity conservation .",
    "however , when a photon is emitted from initial b or s - quark lines , this pure leptonic process change into the corresponding radiative one and no helicity suppression exists anymore .",
    "the contributions coming from the release of a free photon from any internal charged line will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath43 , therefore they can be neglected .",
    "thus , the matrix elements necessary to calculate @xmath16 decay are as follows @xcite-@xcite :    [ mel1 ] ( k ) |s _ ( 1 _ 5 ) b b(p_b ) & = & \\ { _ ^ q^k^g(q^2 ) + & & i f(q^2 ) }  , +   + [ mel2 ] ( k ) |s _ b b(p_b ) & = & _  , + ( k ) |q ( 1 _ 5 ) b b(p_b ) & = & 0 [ ff3 ]  , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the four vector polarization and four momentum of the photon , respectively , @xmath46 is the momentum transfer and @xmath47 is the momentum of the @xmath3 meson . due to eq.([ff3 ] ) , the scalar type interactions do not contribute to the @xmath16 decay , as we have noted before .",
    "using eqs.([mel1]-[ff3 ] ) , the matrix element for @xmath16 decay can be calculated as follows : [ sd ] m & = & \\ { |^(1-_5 ) + & + & |^(1+_5 ) + & + & i _",

    "the final state photon can emerge with a definite polarization and there follows the question of how sensitive the branching ratio is to the new wilson coefficients when the photon is in the positive or negative helicity states . to find an answer to this question",
    ", we evaluate @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath0 decay , in the c.m . frame of @xmath52 , in which four - momenta and polarization vectors , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are as follows : p_b & = & ( e_b,0,0,e_k ) , k = ( e_k,0,0,e_k ) , p_1=(p,0,p , -p z ) + p_2 & = & ( p,0,-p , p z ) , _ 1 = ( 0,1,i,0)/ , _ 2 = ( 0,1,-i,0)/ [ mom ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . in eq.([mom ] ) @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the angle between the momentum of the b - meson and that of @xmath60 in the c.m . frame of @xmath52 . using the above forms ,",

    "the effects of polarized photon can be also studied through a variable `` photon polarization asymmetry '' , @xcite : h(x)= & = & , where [ hx ] ( _ 1)-(_2 ) = x^2",

    "in this section we will present our numerical analysis about the branching ratio ( br ) and the photon polarization asymmetry @xmath63 for @xmath16 decay .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ bela ] ) and ( [ hx ] ) that in order to make such numerical predictions , we first of all need the explicit forms of the form factors @xmath64 and @xmath65 . they are calculated in framework of light ",

    "the values of the other input parameters which have been used in the present work are : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore we assume in this work that all new wilson coefficients are real and vary in the region @xmath78 .",
    "we note that such a choice for the range of the new wilson coefficients follows from the experimental bounds on the branching ratios of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 decays @xcite .      in figs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) , we present the dependence of the @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 decay on the new wilson coefficients , @xmath26,@xmath85,@xmath27,@xmath86,@xmath87 and @xmath88 , where the superscripts @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to the positive and negative helicity states of photon , respectively .",
    "we observe from these figures that among the new interactions considered in the effective hamiltonian the branching ratio in both cases is most sensitive to the tensor type of interactions . indeed ,",
    "e.g. , for @xmath91 , @xmath82 is larger about @xmath92 times compared to that of the sm prediction . for @xmath83 , we get even larger enhancement , which is about @xmath93 times compared to the sm . in addition , the dependence of the branching ratio in both cases on @xmath87 and @xmath88 is symmetrical with respect to the zero point . from figs.([f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) , we also see that branching ratio @xmath82 is sensitive to the vector interactions with coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while @xmath83 is more sensitive to the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    in fig.([f3 ] ) , we present the dependence of the integrated photon polarization asymmetry @xmath63 for @xmath84 decay on the new wilson coefficients , @xmath26,@xmath85,@xmath27,@xmath86,@xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we see that spectrum of @xmath63 is perfectly symmetrical with respect to the zero point for all the new wilson coefficients , except the @xmath86 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath86 , when it is between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , is also the only one which gives the constructive contribution to the sm prediction of @xmath63 , which we find @xmath96 .",
    "this behavior is clear also from fig.([f4 ] ) , in which we plot the differential photon polarization asymmetry @xmath97 for the same decay as a function of dimensionless variable @xmath98 for the different values of the vector interaction with coefficients @xmath86 .",
    "finally , we give in fig.([f5 ] ) , @xmath97 as a function of @xmath99 for the different values of the tensor interaction with coefficients @xmath88 . from these two last figures",
    ", we can conclude that performing measurement of @xmath63 at different photon energies can give information about the signs of the new wilson coefficients , as well as their magnitudes .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied the branching ratio of the @xmath84 decay when photon has positive and negative helicities , also another physically measurable quantity , namely the photon polarization asymetry of the same decay , using a general , model independent effective hamiltonian .",
    "it follows that these physical observables are very sensitive to the existence of new wilson coefficients so that their experimental measurements can give valuable information about new physics .      99 cleo collaboration , r. ammar et al .",
