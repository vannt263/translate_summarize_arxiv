    "because of the interaction between the particles , the factorization of the wave function is not preserved by the time evolution .",
    "however , it turns out that for large @xmath0 the interaction potential experienced by any single particle may be approximated by an effective mean - field potential , so that the wave function @xmath21 remains approximately factorized for all times . in other words",
    "we have that , in a sense to be made precise , @xmath22 for some appropriate @xmath23 .",
    "a simple argument shows that in a product state @xmath24 the interaction potential experienced by a particle is approximately @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes convolution .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 is a solution of the nonlinear hartree equation @xmath27    let us be a little more precise about what one means with @xmath28 ( we omit the irrelevant time argument ) .",
    "one does not expect the @xmath29-distance @xmath30 to become small as @xmath2 .",

    "there are two commonly used indicators of the closeness @xmath41 : the projection @xmath42 and the trace norm distance @xmath43 it is well known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that all of these indicators are equivalent in the sense that the vanishing of either @xmath44 or @xmath45 for some @xmath31 in the limit @xmath2 implies that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "however , the rate of convergence may differ from one indicator to another .",
    "thus , when studying rates of convergence , they are not equivalent ( see section [ measures of convergence ] below for a full discussion ) .",
    "the study of the convergence of @xmath48 in the mean - field limit towards @xmath49 for all @xmath50 has a history going back almost thirty years .",
    "the first result is due to spohn @xcite , who showed that @xmath51 for all @xmath50 provided that @xmath13 is bounded .",

    "it is a simple computation to check that the bbgky hierarchy is equivalent to the schrdinger equation for @xmath21 . using a perturbative expansion of the bbgky hierarchy",
    ", spohn showed that in the limit @xmath2 the family @xmath53 converges to a family @xmath54 that satisfies the limiting bbgky obtained by formally setting @xmath55 in .",
    "this limiting hierarchy is easily seen to be equivalent to the hartree equation via the identification @xmath56 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a short discussion of some subsequent developments .    in the past few years considerable",
    "progress has been made in strengthening such results in mainly two directions .",
    "first , the convergence @xmath57 for all @xmath50 has been proven for singular interaction potentials @xmath13 .",
    "it is for instance of special physical interest to understand the case of a coulomb potential , @xmath58 where @xmath59 . the proofs for singular interaction potentials are considerably more involved than for bounded interaction potentials .",
    "the first result for the case @xmath60 and @xmath61 is due to erds and yau @xcite .",
    "their proof uses the bbgky hierarchy and a weak compactness argument . in @xcite , schlein and elgart extended this result to the technically more demanding case of a semirelativistic kinetic energy , @xmath62 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is a critical case in the sense that the kinetic energy has the same scaling behaviour as the coulomb potential energy , thus requiring quite refined estimates .",
    "a different approach , based on operator methods , was developed by frhlich et al .  in @xcite , where the authors treat the case @xmath60 and @xmath58 .",
    "their proof relies on dispersive estimates and counting of feynman graphs . yet",
    "another approach was adopted by rodnianski and schlein in @xcite .",
    "using methods inspired by a semiclassical argument of hepp @xcite focusing on the dynamics of coherent states in fock space , they show convergence to the mean - field limit in the case @xmath60 and @xmath63 .",
    "the second area of recent progress in understanding the mean - field limit is deriving estimates on the rate of convergence to the mean - field limit .",
    "methods based on expansions , as used in @xcite and @xcite , give very weak bounds on the error @xmath64 , while weak compactness arguments , as used in @xcite and @xcite , yield no information on the rate of convergence . from a physical point of view , where @xmath0 is large but finite , it is of some interest to have tight error bounds in order to be able to address the question whether the mean - field approximation may be regarded as valid .",
    "the first reasonable estimates on the error were derived for the case @xmath65 and @xmath58 by rodnianski and schlein in their work @xcite mentioned above .",
    "in fact they derive an explicit estimate on the error of the form @xmath66 for some constants @xmath67 . using a novel approach inspired by lieb - robinson bounds , erds and",
    "schlein @xcite further improved this estimate under the more restrictive assumption that @xmath13 is bounded and its fourier transform integrable .",
    "their result is @xmath68 for some constants @xmath69 .    in the present article",
    "we adopt yet another approach based on a method of pickl @xcite .",
    "we strengthen and generalize many of the results listed above , by treating more singular interaction potentials as well as deriving estimates on the rate of convergence .",
    "moreover , our approach allows for a large class of ( possibly time - dependent ) external potentials , which might for instance describe a trap confining the particles to a small volume .",
    "we also show that if the solution @xmath70 of the hartree equation satisfies a scattering condition , all of the error estimates are uniform in time .    the outline of the article is as follows",
    ". section [ measures of convergence ] is devoted to a short discussion of the indicators of convergence @xmath45 and @xmath44 , in which we derive estimates relating them to each other . in section [ l2 potentials ] we state and",
