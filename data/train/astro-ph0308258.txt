    "the very compact h ii  regions in the magellanic clouds , extremely reddened , yet observable at the optical wavelengths , represent the early evolutionary stage of the cradles of the more recent star formation ( sf ) .",
    "if the duration of sf episodes is related to the size of the sf regions @xcite , then the very compact h ii  regions in the smc are the ideal probes of recent star formation in a low metallicity environment .    while completing our _ hst _ snapshot survey of smc planetary nebulae ( pns ; _ hst _ program 8663 , cycle 10 ; see stanghellini et al .",
    "2003 ) , we found that two of the target pns where misclassified in the ground - based catalog @xcite .",
    "on the basis of their morphological properties in both the narrow and broad band images we found that these targets are the most compact , most reddened h ii  regions in the smc known to date .",
    "furthermore , in one of the h ii  region frames we serendipitously observed an additional , very compact h ii  region , previously classified as an emission - line object ( and possibly a h ii  region ) by @xcite . our broad band and slitless spectra acquired with stis disclose some extreme properties of these three regions , including extreme extinction , that are worth discussing .",
    "only a handful of objects similar to the ones presented here are currently known in the magellanic clouds , and only three of them have been discovered in the smc . the sample presented in this paper then doubles the existing database of h ii  regions that are much more compact than the typical magellanic cloud h ii  regions , and that have very high reddening .    in this paper",
    "we present the _ hst _ stellar and nebular data of ma  1796 , ma  1797 , and mg  2 . in @xmath12 we give an overview of the observing strategy . in @xmath13",
    "we discuss the imaging and spectral analysis , including the determination of the extinction from the nebular balmer emission , the ionizing flux inferred from nebular balmer emission , the visual stellar magnitudes of the brightest stars within the regions , and the cluster nir magnitudes .",
    "@xmath14 includes a discussion of our findings in the context of star formation in the smc .",
    "the observations were acquired with stis .",
    "all observations were made with the ccd detector , in direct imaging ( 50ccd ) and slitless mode .",
    "the spatial scale of the ccd is 0.051 arcsec pixel@xmath2 , corresponding to 0.014 pc pixel@xmath2 at the distance of the smc .",
    "this allows a good spatial resolution to study the h ii  region structures .",
    "each imaging observation was split in two , to allow easy cosmic rays removal .",
    "the slitless spectra were acquired with the g430 m and g750 m gratings .",
    "observations with the g430 m grating cover the range 4818    to 5104    at 0.28    pixel@xmath2 , and those with the g750 m grating cover the range 6295    to 6867    at 0.56    pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the exposures where originally planned to get good signal to noise ratio in the brightest emission lines of pns , thus were not ideally designed with h ii  regions in mind .",
    "the observing log is reported in table 1 , where we list the targets , their coordinates , the observing date , the data set name , the spectral element used in the observations , and the exposure time and number of exposures obtained .",
    "ma  1796 has been classified as a new smc pn by @xcite ( simbad resolver : [ ma93 ] 1796 ) .",
    "it is located on the outer side of the larger , young stellar cluster ngc  456 .",
    "ma  1796 and ngc  456 could be physically associated , but our data are not helpful in establishing any connection .",
    "mg  2 is catalogued as a pn in @xcite ( simbad resolver : mgpn smc 2 ) .",
    "there are no published spectra of this object , nor images that resolve the h ii  region spatially .",
    "ma  1797 ( simbad resolver : [ ma93 ] 1797 ) was previously catalogued as a possible h ii  region by @xcite , possibly part of the dem  152 cluster .",
    "the stis data were calibrated using the standard pipeline system , as in the lmc pn data @xcite .",
    "figure 1 show the observed h ii  regions in the three observing modes : broad band ccd , [ oiii ]  , and h@xmath3  images .",
    "the images are to scale , to reflect the relative physical scales .",
    "the apparent and physical dimensions of the nebulae are listed in table 2 , columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "spectral analysis have been performed in the same way to that of lmc and smc pns @xcite .",
    "the combination of dispersion and spatial scale allows a clear separation of the monochromatic images for the major emission lines .",
    "we extract the one - dimensional spectra and applied a photometric calibration using the standard stis calibration pipeline module * x1d * @xcite .",
    "we used extraction boxes for the regions large enough to encompass the nebular features , but snug enough as to exclude most of the sky background from the extraction .",
    "sky background regions were selected for each object to avoid stray stellar photons from field stars .",
    "the background was then averaged and subtracted .",
    "we measured emission line intensities with iraf * splot * task , fitting gaussians to individual lines , while estimating the continuum level . in the cases in which the emission lines were notably non gaussian , we estimated the line flux as measured from the area above the continuum .",
    "the measured fluxes are listed in table 2 , columns ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) .",
    "we identified the h@xmath4  and the [ oiii ]  @xmath5 4959,5007 lines in the g430 m spectrum of mg  2 .",
    "the h@xmath3  emission is the only nebular feature in the g750 m spectrum of this h ii  region .",
    "the given h@xmath3  flux includes the [ nii ]  emission , although the slitless spectrogram suggest that the [ nii ]  contribution to the flux is marginal .",
    "the analysis of the ma  1796 spectra shows the [ oiii ]  and h@xmath4  lines detected with a very good signal to noise ratio .",
    "the [ sii ]  emission at @xmath66716,6731 is also detected .",
    "ma  1797 was serendipitously observed at the edge of the field , so the h@xmath4  emission does not appear in the g430 m spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath3  flux is high , comparable with that of the previously observed compact h ii  regions n  81 and n  88a .",
    "we derive the optical extinction from the analysis of the nebular balmer lines , and we give the logarithmic extinction constants ( c ) in table 2 , column ( 5 ) .",
    "we assume that the optical extinction law is the same in the galaxy and the smc , thus we do not estimate the foreground extinction separately .",
    "the derived extinction is rather a lower limit , since we do not consider possible regions whose optical flux is totally absorbed .",
    "our feeling is that the extinction corrections should be higher than what estimated from the nebular lines .    with a h@xmath3  /h@xmath4  flux ratio of 8.7 ,",
    "mg  2 is evidently an extremely reddened object .",
    "note that the flux ratio could be off by a factor of two , given the flux uncertainties , and still be extremely high for a compact h ii  regions . by assuming t@xmath7=10,000 k",
    ", we estimate the logarithmic optical extinction constant c=1.4 ( or e@xmath8=0.95 , seaton 1979 ) .",
    "the optical extinction constant of ma  1796 , c=1.53 , is the highest ever measured in a compact smc h  ii region .",
    "this nebula is a factor of 10 lower in excitation than mg  2 .",
    "given that we do not measured its h@xmath4  flux , we could not derive the extinction constant for ma  1797 .",
    "we computed the rms density of ma  1796 and mg  2 , based upon our knowledge of the h@xmath4  flux , the average nebular extinction , the known distance to the smc , and the physical extent of the nebulae , using the formulation :    @xmath9^{0.5}\\eqno(1),\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the h@xmath4  ( or h@xmath3  ) frequency , @xmath11 is the recombination coefficient for h@xmath4  ( or h@xmath3  ) , v is the nebular volume , and w is the geometrical dilution factor . the log density is given in column ( 8) of table 2 .",
    "we also estimated the total number of ionizing photons , q@xmath12 , for the strmgren spheres corresponding to the sizes of these nebulae @xcite , assuming that all ionizing radiation is contained within the regions .",
    "the results , in the last column of table 3 , are roughly consistent with a single b0 or a very late o main - sequence star exciting the region @xcite .",
    "the value of q@xmath12 is very uncertain because it is proportional to the square of the electron density , which itself is very uncertain .",
    "it also depends upon the assumption of high optical depth to ionizing radiation , which is probably a reasonable approximation for ultra compact h ii  regions .",
    "we did not attempt an estimate of the fraction of the ionizing radiation absorbed by dust ( see discussion of the reddening ) .",
    "in the case of ma  1797 we perform the calculation of the density and q@xmath12 from the h@xmath3  flux , uncorrected for extinction .",
    "the resulting analysis for this region is extremely uncertain , and it is given in table 2 only as an indication .",
    "in the next section we make use of these approximate values for q@xmath12 in these nebulae to aid our interpretation of the stellar photometry .      with the high spatial resolution of _ hst",
    "_ we can easily resolve the stars individually , thus we can use aperture photometry with confidence .",
    "we have measured the magnitudes of the brightest stars within ma  1796 and mg  2 .",
    "the stellar photometry was performed with the _ apphot _ package in iraf , through a circular aperture of 2 pixels of radius .",
    "the averaged sky within an annulus 1 pixel wide adjacent to the position of the star was then subtracted to the stellar measurement .",
    "the sky includes the nebular emission as well . the measured instrumental magnitudes ( stmag system ) use the zero - point calibration by @xcite . the aperture correction has been taken from the curve of encircled energy derived by @xcite for stars near the field center .",
    "the 50ccd mirror has broad - band transmission , and its response curve is far from that of the standard v filter .",
    "the transformation between the measured instrumental magnitudes and the standard v magnitudes depends on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source , which is determined by the amount of extinction and , to a lesser extent , by the stellar temperature .",
    "we do not have the stellar temperatures of the stars , but we know that they are hot enough to ionize h ii  regions , thus we infer their temperatures to be in the range between 30,000 and 50,000 k. we assume that the extinction toward the stars is the average nebular extinction .",
    "we feed these parameters to the iraf / stsdas routine * synphot * , to perform the synthetic photometric modeling necessary to derive the transformation to the standard v magnitudes .    in table 3",
    "we give the photometric measurements of the three brightest stars in ma  1796 , and the 5 brightest stars in mg  2 .",
    "the quoted errors in the v standard magnitudes include the standard deviation of the transformation for the range of temperatures used . in figures 2 and 3",
    "we identify the stars with the same numbering than in table 3 , for ma  1796 ( fig .",
    "2 ) and mg  2 ( fig .",
    "we have corrected the v magnitudes for extinction by using the approximate relation between the average logarithmic extinction constant derived for the nebula , c , and the color excess , e@xmath13 ( c  =  1.47  e@xmath13 , seaton 1979 ) .",
    "the smc extinction law is very similar to the galactic law in this wavelength range @xcite , so we have used the galactic reddening curve law of @xcite , and assumed that r@xmath14  =  3.1 .",
    "the stellar extinction in magnitudes we apply is then a@xmath14  =  2.1  c.    in order to derive the absolute visual magnitudes , we have used the average smc distance modulus obtained with the rr lyrae method @xcite .",
    "none of the stellar magnitudes measured and transformed as described above correspond to an o star of any subclass , according to the calibration of @xcite , the explanation probably lies in the extinction , being higher than measured .      in order to frame the extinction correction a little better ,",
    "we have searched the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) for near infrared sources within 5 \" of the central position of ma  1796 and mg  2 .",
    "we found that each h ii region is uniquely associated with one compact object in the 2mass point source catalogue ( all - sky point source catalog ) . the j ,",
    "h , and ks magnitudes corresponding to these two point sources are listed in table 4 .    in a jhk color - color diagram ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "ma  1796 and mg  2 would lay outside and to the right of the reddening band , indicating the presence of intrinsic infrared excess .",
    "this result alone could have indicated that the objects are not common pns .",
    "intrinsic infrared excesses are indicative of the presence of circumstellar material . according to @xcite , young stellar objects and herbig ae / be stars populate the part of the near - infrared color - color diagram where our sources are located .",
    "we have identified two new compact young stellar cluster in the smc , that were previously classified as pns .",
    "the unique spatial resolution of _ hst _ clearly disclose that these objects , merely a few arcsecond across , are not pns .",
    "limited analysis of their nebular spectra disclose very high h@xmath3  to h@xmath4  ratios , placing them among the extreme compact and reddened h ii regions in the smc , as observed at the optical wavelengths .",
    "imaging and the h@xmath3  flux are also available for a third , larger h ii region that was serendipitously observed in the same frame of one of the misclassified pns .",
    "stellar photometry places the brightest stars in the regions out of the o star domain .",
    "the definitive stellar classification is not possible with the present data .",
    "if the stars observed near the center of these nebulae are in fact providing all or most of the ionizing photons , then the spectral types inferred from the observed brightness and the bolometric correction are inconsistent with the observed level of nebular ionization .",
    "a possible explanation is that the stars suffer greater extinction than is inferred from the nebular balmer decrement .",
    "we conclude that we observed a few very young clusters of recent star formation , but the details of the populations therein are left to a future investigation .",
    "we plan to perform ubv photometry of these regions , possibly with _",
    "hst _ resolution , to disclose the true nature of the component stars .",
    "infrared observations at high resolution are also necessary to analyze in detail the reddening structure of these unique h ii regions . a small cluster of stars whose few brightest and hottest members are of early b or late o spectral type is consistent both with the level of nebular ionization , and with the small physical size of the nebula .",
    "we also plan to obtain the physical parameters of the gas , such as temperature , density , and abundances , from moderate resolution ground based optical spectra .",
    "such observations will also verify our estimated of the ionizing photons from the embedded stars .",
    "this work was supported by nasa through grant go-08663.01-a from space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas -26555 .",
