    "the formation of planetary and stellar systems is heavily affected by the abundance of dust @xcite ; in particular dust is the the building block of rocky planets in protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dust in the ism scatters ultraviolet and visible light , and emits brightly in the infrared @xcite .",
    "however , dust formation in stellar and galactic environments is not well understood .",
    "the observation of crystalline silicates @xcite and dust formation in the hostile environment of colliding winds of wr stars @xcite underline serious holes in our understanding of the physics of the phase transition at the base of dust formation .",
    "in addition , theoretical predictions of dust formation in supernova explosions over - predict the amount of dust observed at early times by several orders of magnitudes ( on timescales of one year after core - collapse ) @xcite",
    ". the limitations of the classical theory of nucleation for dust formation have been repeatedly pointed out @xcite . among the weaknesses of the theory",
    "is that of assuming quasi - equilibrium conditions for a strongly out of equilibrium phenomenon , the assumption of local thermal equilibrium , ignoring the presence of other components in the gas phase , and the capillary approximation .",
    "the capillary approximation is used to predict the binding energy of very small molecular clusters by assuming : ( i ) that they are spherical in shape , ( ii ) that a surface can be defined for them , and ( iii ) that the surface energy does not depend on the cluster size . since the nucleation rate depends exponentially on the energy of cluster formation , and",
    "since the critical size of refractory grains is usually small due to the large temperatures at which nucleation occurs , the capillary approximation can be devastating to the accuracy of the results .",
    "another limitation of dust formation calculations is that they assume homogeneous nucleation , i.e. that each compound nucleated independently of all the other atoms and molecules in the gas phase . while this is inaccurate in some environments such as the interstellar medium , where abundant hydrogen can incorporate into dust materials , we here consider only pure carbon clusters .",
    "our results should be therefore considered relevant only for carbon - rich environments .    in this article",
    "we bypass the difficulties of the capillary approximation by using the atomistic formulation of the energy of cluster formation to determine nucleation rates .",
    "this approach accounts for clusters to form in irregular shapes , and has been shown to better model nucleation rates in crystals @xcite .",
    "using modern molecular and quantum mechanical methods we find the ground state configuration and cohesive energy ( and thus binding energy ) of small carbon clusters up to @xmath3 atoms .",
    "while results for some clusters are available in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) we offer here a comprehensive study of all sizes up to @xmath3 , as required for application in the nucleation theory .",
    "we use these data to make predictions of critical cluster sizes and nucleation rates using both the thermodynamic and the kinetic nucleation theory .",
