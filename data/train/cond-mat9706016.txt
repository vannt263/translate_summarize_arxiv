    "the issue of quantum computation has attracted much attention recently @xcite .",
    "quantum algorithms can perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers  @xcite .",
    "the basic concepts of quantum computation are quantum operations ( gates ) on quantum bits ( qubits ) and registers , i.  e.  arrays of qubits .",
    "a qubit can be any two - level system which can be prepared in arbitrary superpositions of its two eigenstates .",
    "quantum computation requires `` quantum state engineering '' , i.  e.  the processes of preparation and manipulation of these quantum states in a controllable way . for quantum registers",
    "also `` entangled states '' ( like the epr state of two spins ) have to be constructed .",
    "this necessitates a coupling between different qubits , and one has to be able to construct many - qubits states ( many - particle states ) in a controllable way .",
    "several physical systems have been proposed as qubits @xcite .",
    "a serious limitation is the requirement that the phase coherence time is sufficiently long to allow the coherent quantum manipulations .",
    "the theoretically and experimentally most advanced system appears to be the chain with trapped ions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative system , composed of low - capacitance josephson junctions .",
    "the coherent tunneling of cooper pairs mixes different charge states . by controlling the gate voltages",
    "we can control the strength of the mixing .",
    "the physics of coherent cooper - pair tunneling in this system has been established before  @xcite .",
    "the algorithms of quantum computation introduce new , well - defined rules .",
    "their realization in experiments creates a new challenge . here , we consider a one - bit system and we describe the possible ways of constructing quantum states .",
    "then we focus on a two - bit system , where we propose a controllable coupling and we discuss the construction of two - bit states . in section 2 , we consider ideal systems .",
    "in section 3 we include the coupling to a realistic external electrodynamic environment which limits the phase coherence time .",
    "the system we propose as a qubit is shown in fig.[one_bit_ideal ] .",
    "it consists of two small superconducting grains connected by a tunnel junction .",
    "the junction is characterized by its capacitance @xmath0 and the josephson energy @xmath1 .",
    "an ideal voltage source is connected to the system via two external capacitors @xmath2 .",
    "we assume the total number of electrons in both grains to be even , so that at low enough temperatures all electrons are paired .",
    "moreover , we assume that the superconducting energy gap @xmath3 is the largest energy in the problem .",
    "thus we can neglect pair - breaking processes .",
    "the complete set of possible quantum states is , then , characterized by @xmath4 and @xmath5 - the numbers of extra cooper pairs on the left and the right island , respectively .",
    "since there is no tunneling through the external capacitors , the total number of the extra cooper pairs @xmath6 is constant . in the following we assume @xmath7 .",
    "hence the set of basis states is parameterized by the number of cooper pairs on one island or their difference @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the conjugate to the variable @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 is the flux quantum .",
    "we consider systems where the charging energy of the internal capacitor @xmath13 is much larger than @xmath1 . in this regime",
    "the energy levels are determined by the charging part of the hamiltonian ( [ 1bit_hamiltonian ] ) for most values of the external voltage @xmath14 . however ,",
    "when @xmath14 is such that the charging energies of two neighboring states @xmath15 and @xmath16 are close to each other , the josephson tunneling becomes relevant .",
    "then the two eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 with an energy gap of @xmath1 between them .",
    "we concentrate on the voltage interval near one such degeneracy point .",
    "we demand , however , the interval to be wide enough , so that for most values of the voltage away from degeneracy to a reasonable approximation the eigenstates are @xmath15 and @xmath16 . near the degeneracy points we can translate ( [ 1bit_hamiltonian ] ) to the spin-@xmath17 language : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . using this language we can immediately propose a few one - bit operations . if , for example , one chooses the operating point ( i.  e.  the voltage ) away from the degeneracy , the logical states @xmath21 and @xmath22 are just @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "then , switching the system suddenly to the degeneracy point for a time @xmath25 and switching suddenly back , we can perform one of the basic one - bit operations ( gates ) - a spin flip : @xmath26 to get rid of the time - dependent phases we perform all the calculations is the interaction picture , when the zero order hamiltonian is the hamiltonian at the operation point . to estimate the time - width @xmath25 of the voltage pulse needed for a total spin flip , we note that a reasonable experimental value of @xmath1 is of the order of @xmath27k .",
    "it can not be chosen much smaller , since the condition @xmath28 must be satisfied",
    ". therefore the time - width is very short : @xmath29s .",
    "however there exists an alternative way to perform a coherent spin flip , as follows : the system is pushed adiabatically to the degeneracy point .",
    "then the ac voltage with frequency @xmath30 is applied .",
    "the process is completely analogous to the paramagnetic resonance ( here the constant magnetic field component is in the x - direction , while the oscillating one is in the z - direction ) .",
    "the time - width of the ac pulse needed for the total spin flip depends on its amplitude , therefore it can be chosen much longer then @xmath31s .",
    "one can also perform an operation which changes only the relative phase between the the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to this end",
    "one should suddenly switch to another voltage away from the degeneracy and switch suddenly to the original point .",
    "the phase is acquired due to difference in energy gaps between the two points .      to perform two - bit operations ( gates ) which result in entangled states",
    ", one has to couple the qubits in a controllable way .",
    "the best situation would be one where the coupling can be switched off , leaving the qubits uncoupled when no operations are performed . unfortunately , this option appears difficult to realize in microscopic and mesoscopic systems . as an alternative we suggest for a system with a weak constant coupling between the qubits .",
    "we will show that by tuning the energy gaps of the individual qubits we can change the effective strength of the coupling .",
    "we propose to couple two qubits using an inductance as shown in fig.([two_bit_ideal ] ) .",
    "one can easily see that if @xmath32 the system reduces to two uncoupled qubits , while if @xmath33 the coulomb interaction couples both qubits strongly .",
    "therefore , we are interested in low values of @xmath34 ( the exact criterion to be specified ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this system is @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the total charge on the external capacitors of both qubits , @xmath37 is its conjugate variable , and @xmath38 .",
    "the oscillator described by @xmath36 and @xmath37 variables produces an effective mean field coupling between the qubits for frequencies smaller than @xmath39 . in order to have this coupling in a wide enough voltage interval around the degeneracy point",
    ", we demand that @xmath40 although the integration over @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be performed exactly starting with ( [ 2bit_hamiltonian ] ) , the resulting effective action is not simple .",
    "we prefer an alternative way .",
    "first we perform a canonical transformation @xmath41 @xmath42 , which results in a new hamiltonian ( we omit the tildes ) : @xmath43   \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + { q^2\\over 2(2c_{\\rm t } ) } + { \\phi^2\\over 2l } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we make an additional assumption @xmath44 this assumption is , actually , necessary if one wishes to have josephson tunneling terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "qualitatively , one can observe from ( [ 2bit_hamiltonian_cosine ] ) , that if ( [ small_fluctuation_assumption ] ) does not hold , the @xmath45 terms are washed out . below we will obtain this result in a more rigorous way .",
    "assuming the condition ( [ small_fluctuation_assumption ] ) we expand the @xmath45 terms of ( [ 2bit_hamiltonian_cosine ] ) in powers of @xmath37 and we neglect powers higher than linear .",
    "then we can perform the integrations over @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are again gaussian . as a result",
    "we obtain an effective hamiltonian , which consists of two one - bit hamiltonians ( [ 1bit_hamiltonian ] ) and a coupling term : @xmath46 ^ 2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 this hamiltonian is valid for frequencies which are smaller than @xmath48 . in the spin-@xmath17 language",
    "it is @xmath49 the mixed term in ( [ 2bit_spin_coupling ] ) is important in certain situations .",
    "assume that @xmath50 is comparable to @xmath1 and the voltages @xmath51 and @xmath52 are such that both qubits are out of degeneracy .",
    "then , to a good approximation , the eigenstates of the two - bit system without coupling are @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in a general situation ,",
    "these states are separated by energies which are larger or much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the effect of the coupling is small .",
    "if , however , a pair of these state is degenerate , the coupling may lift the degeneracy , changing the eigenstates drastically .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 , the states @xmath54 and @xmath55 are degenerate . in this case",
    "the correct eigenstates are : @xmath58 and @xmath59 with the energy splitting @xmath50 between them .",
    "now we are ready to propose a way to perform two - bit operations which will result in entangled states . for this",
    "we choose the operating points for the qubits at different voltages .",
    "then we switch suddenly the voltages to be equal for a time @xmath25 and switch suddenly back .",
    "the result is a `` generalized '' spin - flip , which may be described in the basis \\{@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 } by a matrix : @xmath60 the gate ( [ 2bit_operation ] ) together with the one - bit gates ( [ 1bit_spin_flip ] ) constitute a universal set , i.e. , they are sufficient for quantum computation .",
    "instead of applying very short voltage pulses , one again can move the system adiabatically to the degeneracy point ( @xmath61 ) , and , then , apply an ac voltage pulse in the antisymmetric channel @xmath62 .",
    "the idealized picture outlined above has to be corrected with respect to the possible dissipation mechanisms , which , as usual , cause decoherence and energy relaxation . in this paper",
    "we focus on the effect of ohmic dissipation in the circuit , which originates mostly from the voltage sources .",
    "we also consider the effect of lc resonances in the circuit .",
    "we neglect quasi - particle tunneling since it is strongly suppressed at low temperatures and low voltages . the system is shown in fig.[one_bit_dissipation ] .",
    "we include the inductance @xmath34 explicitly for two reasons .",
    "first , we would like to couple the bath of oscillators to a continuous charge variable , rather than directly coupling them to the discrete variable @xmath63 .",
    "second , we would like to treat the @xmath64 oscillatory mode separately from the bath oscillators , since it plays an important role in the two - bit system .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is : @xmath65 where @xmath66 \\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath67 . in ( [ 1bit_dissipative_hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ bath_hamiltonian_q ] )",
    "the variable @xmath36 denotes the charge on the external capacitors , while @xmath37 is its conjugate variable .",
    "the coupling to the bath ( [ bath_hamiltonian_q ] ) produces the usual dissipative term - @xmath68 - in the equation of motion for @xmath36 .",
    "although the hamiltonian ( [ 1bit_dissipative_hamiltonian ] ) is quite transparent , another equivalent form is more convenient .",
    "it is obtained after two consequent canonical transformations : @xmath69 and @xmath70 now the hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath71 + { \\bar q^2\\over 2c_{\\rm t } } + h'_{\\rm bath}(\\tilde\\phi ) \\ .\\ ] ] where @xmath72 +    { ( \\tilde \\phi - \\sum_j { \\lambda_j\\over{m_j   \\omega_j^2 } } \\tilde p_j)^2   \\over { 2l } }   \\ .\\ ] ] the two forms ( [ 1bit_dissipative_hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ 1bit_dissipative_hamiltonian_phi ] ) differ mostly in the definition of the phase variable conjugated to @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath34 is small enough , the variable @xmath37 fluctuates in a small interval around zero .",
    "however , the fluctuations of @xmath73 are around a bath - dependent value , which may fluctuate strongly itself .",
    "below we will see that both forms may be useful in different situations .",
    "first , we estimate the energy relaxation time , @xmath74 , due to the ohmic dissipation .",
    "we assume that the system is away from the degeneracy point and is prepared in one of its eigenstates ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) at the beginning .",
    "we use the hamiltonian in the second form ( [ 1bit_dissipative_hamiltonian_phi ] ) . the part of ( [ 1bit_dissipative_hamiltonian_phi ] ) connecting the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath75 at this point we can directly apply the standard golden rule results for the transition rate from the state @xmath15 to the state @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath76 \\ , \\\\",

    "l } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath77 is the energy gap between the two states .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the system is , as usual , controlled by the dimensionless conductance @xmath78 . in our system a remarkable renormalization of the controlling parameter @xmath79",
    "occurs : from ( [ p(e ) ] ) one can observe that @xmath80 is the relevant parameter .",
    "thus , making the external capacitances @xmath2 much smaller than the internal one - @xmath0 , we can drastically reduce the effect of the dissipation .",
    "physically , this means that the fluctuations produced by the resistor are screened by the small capacitors , and , therefore , they have little effect on the josephson junction .    to be more concrete , we exploit the asymptotic formula for @xmath81 @xcite @xmath82^{2/\\tilde g } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the gamma function . for large values of @xmath84",
    "we obtain : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the operation time ( see ( [ 1bit_spin_flip ] ) ) .      at the degeneracy point the system is equivalent to the two - level model with a weak ohmic dissipation , which was extensively studied during the last decades @xcite .",
    "it is well known that when @xmath87 coherent oscillations take place .",
    "these oscillations make the spin - flip operation ( [ 1bit_spin_flip ] ) possible .",
    "the decay time of the coherent oscillations is given by @xmath88 and the energy gap @xmath1 is slightly renormalized : @xmath89 the physical cut - off @xmath90 is usually a system - dependent property . for a pure ohmic dissipation caused by a metallic resistor it may be as high as the drude frequency .",
    "however , when additional capacitances and inductances are present in the circuit , the relevant cut - off may be lowered to the characteristic @xmath64 frequencies .    as was said above",
    ", the @xmath64 phase fluctuations can wash out the josephson coupling . to see this , we begin with the first form of the hamiltonian ( [ 1bit_dissipative_hamiltonian ] ) and we integrate out the bath variables and the oscillatory mode variables - @xmath91 .",
    "the partition function reads : @xmath92 \\right\\ }    \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath94 below we will show , that in the relevant parameters range , the following inequality holds @xmath95 therefore , the natural cutoff for ( [ g(tau_tau ) ] ) would be @xmath96 . to make a rough estimation we replace ( [ g(tau_tau ) ] ) by @xmath97 the kernel ( [ g_approximate ] ) is a sum of a trivial charging energy renormalization ( the first term ) , the usual ohmic dissipation ( the third term ) and the inductive term , which we will focus on .",
    "we apply the standard charge representation technique @xcite , expanding @xmath98 $ ] in powers of @xmath1 and integrating over @xmath10 term by term .",
    "one obtains , then , a path integral over integer charge paths with instantaneous `` jumps '' between the different values of @xmath63 .",
    "each such `` jump '' contributes a multiplicative factor of @xmath99 to the weight of the path .",
    "it turns out that the inductive term contributes another multiplicative factor for each `` jump '' , so that @xmath1 is renormalized as : @xmath100 one can immediately observe that the condition that @xmath1 is not renormalized to zero coincides with the small fluctuations condition ( [ small_fluctuation_assumption ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the phase fluctuations which may wash out the josephson coupling in ( [ e_j_renormalization ] ) are related to the `` weakly fluctuating '' phase @xmath37 , rather than to the `` strongly fluctuating '' @xmath101 ( see ( [ canonical_transformation_phi ] ) ) .",
    "thus the effects of the inductance and the dissipation may be well separated in this regime .",
    "another way of viewing this separation is by noting that the @xmath64 phase fluctuations are fast , therefore they effectively wash out the slower processes ( like josephson tunneling ) . on the other hand",
    "the phase fluctuations , caused by the resistor , are large only at low frequencies , thus they can not wash out the faster processes .      in this subsection",
    "we show that the coupling term ( [ 2bit_coupling ] ) survives when the ohmic dissipation is present in the circuit .",
    "the analyzed system is shown in fig.([two_bit_dissipation ] ) .",
    "we include the auxiliary inductances @xmath102 in order to couple the dissipation bathes to continuous charge variable , rather than directly to the principal variables @xmath63 and @xmath103 . finally we take @xmath104 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the charge on the left - most external capacitor , while @xmath107 is the charge on the right - most external capacitor . @xmath108 and @xmath109 are their conjugate phases ( weakly fluctuating ones ) .",
    "we make a canonical transformation @xmath110 ( @xmath42 ) and the new hamiltonian looks like ( we omit the tildes ) : @xmath111 + { q_i^2\\over 2c_{\\rm t } } +   h_{\\rm bath}\\left(q_i + { c_{\\rm t}\\over",
    "c_{\\rm j}}2e n_i\\right )   \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + { ( \\phi_1+\\phi_2)^2\\over 4l_a } + { ( \\phi_1-\\phi_2)^2\\over 4(2l+l_a ) } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the canonical transformation ( [ 2bit_canonical_dissipative ] ) looks equivalent to ( [ canonical_transformation_theta ] ) , there is one essential difference . in ( [ canonical_transformation_theta ] )",
    "we used the phase variable which included the bath fluctuations , while in ( [ 2bit_canonical_dissipative ] ) we keep the weakly fluctuating phases @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "next , we expand the @xmath45 terms in @xmath108 and @xmath109 and we integrate over the baths and over the two oscillatory modes .",
    "finally we assume @xmath104 .",
    "one can directly check that in the nondiagonal channel the mixed term of ( [ 2bit_coupling ] ) emerges , accompanied with a bunch of other terms which are small at low frequency .",
    "thus , the two - bit coupling , crucial for the quantum computation , is stable under the influence of the dissipation .",
    "several conditions were assumed in this letter in order to guarantee the validity of our results .",
    "here we state these conditions once more and discuss the appropriate ranges of parameters .",
    "we start with @xmath112k as a suitable experimental condition . to satisfy @xmath113",
    "we take @xmath114f , which is an experimentally accessible value . as we would like @xmath115 to be large ( [ high_frequency_condition ] )",
    ", it seems that @xmath34 and @xmath116 should be as small as possible .",
    "however , the two - bit coupling energy , @xmath50 ( [ e_l ] ) , should be larger than the temperature of the experiment . assuming a reasonable working temperature of @xmath117mk , we demand @xmath118k . from ( [ high_frequency_condition ] ) and ( [ e_l ] ) we get @xmath119 . to have a wide enough operation voltage interval we take @xmath120 , and obtain @xmath121f and @xmath122h .",
    "thus the renormalization of @xmath79 is of the order of @xmath123 , and @xmath124 ( assuming the realistic value @xmath125 ) ( [ energy_relaxation_time ] ) .",
    "finally we observe that in this range of parameters the inequalities ( [ small_fluctuation_assumption ] ) and ( [ frequences_unequality ] ) are always satisfied . we conclude that the quantum manipulations we have discussed in this paper can be tested experimentally using the currently available lithographic and cryogenic techniques .",
    "application of the josephson junction system as an element of a quantum computer is a more subtle issue , demanding either the fabrication of junctions with @xmath126f , or a further reduction of the working temperature .",
