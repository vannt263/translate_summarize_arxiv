    "a number of physical phenomenon from water waves traveling in narrow canals @xcite , to phase transitions in the early universe @xcite exhibit the formation of localized , energy density configurations , even without gravitational interactions .",
    "the reason for their longevity are varied .",
    "some configurations are stable due to conservation of topological or nontopological charges , while some are due to a dynamical balance between the nonlinearities and dissipative forces .",
    "relativistic , scalar field theories ( with nonlinear potentials ) form simple yet interesting candidates for studying such phenomenon .",
    "some well - studied examples include topological solitons in the @xmath0-dimensional sine - gordon model and nontopological solitons such as q - balls @xcite .",
    "the sine - gordon soliton is stationary in time whereas the q - balls are oscillatory in nature .",
    "both have conserved charges which make them stable ( at least without coupling to gravity ) .",
    "this paper deals with another interesting example of such localized configurations called oscillons ( also called breathers ) . like the sine - gordon soliton",
    ", they can exist in real scalar fields , and like the q - balls they are oscillatory in nature . unlike both of the above examples they do not have any known conserved charges ( however , see @xcite for an adiabatic invariant ) .",
    "in general they decay , however their lifetimes are significantly longer than any natural time scales present in the lagrangian . along with their longevity ,",
    "another fascinating aspect of oscillons is that they emerge naturally from relatively arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "not all scalar field theories support oscillons . in the next section",
    "we discuss the requirements for the potential . here , we note that the requirement is satisfied by a large number of physically well - motivated examples . for example , the potential for the axion , as well as almost any potential near a vacuum expectation value related to symmetry breaking , support oscillons .",
    "oscillons have also been found in the restricted standard model @xmath1 , @xcite .",
    "oscillons first made their appearance in the literature in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "they were subsequently rediscovered in the 1990s @xcite .",
    "oscillons are not exact solutions and ( very slowly ) radiate their energy away .",
    "the amplitude of the outgoing radiation ( in the small amplitude expansion ) has been calculated by a number of authors , see for example @xcite .",
    "characterization of their lifetimes and related properties using the  gaussian \" ansatz for the spatial profile was done in @xcite ( also see references therein ) .",
    "the importance of the dimensionality of space for these objects has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "their possible applications in early universe physics has not gone unnoticed .",
    "for example , they could be relevant for axion dynamics near the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "the properties of oscillons in a @xmath0-dimensional expanding universe ( in the small amplitude limit ) have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "their importance during bubble collisions and phase transitions have been discussed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "interactions of oscillons with each other and with domain walls were studied in 2 + 1 dimensions .    in this paper , we point out what is required of scalar field potentials to support oscillons .",
    "we then derive the frequency as well as the spatial profile of the oscillons for a class of models under consideration .",
    "we show that the spatial profile can be very different from a gaussian , an ansatz often made in the literature .",
    "in particular , we derive the nonmonotonic relationship between the height and the width of the oscillons , and discuss the importance of this feature for the stability of oscillons ( see @xcite for a somewhat related analysis for q - balls ) . to the best of our knowledge , this has not been done previously in the literature in the context of oscillons .",
    "we consider the stability of oscillons against small perturbations , mainly with spatial variations comparable to the width of the oscillons .",
    "we also comment on a possible , narrow band instability at higher wave numbers .",
    "oscillons could have important applications in cosmology , especially in the early universe . with this in mind",
    ", we discuss the changes in the profile and the loss of energy from these oscillons due to expansion .",
    "the properties of oscillons can depend significantly on the number of spatial dimensions . in this paper , for simplicity we always start with @xmath0-dimensional scenarios where analytic treatment is often possible .",
    "we then extend our results to the physically more interesting case of @xmath2 dimensions , analytically where possible and numerically otherwise .",
    "we extend previous analysis to the interesting  flat - top \" oscillons because of our new systematic method for capturing the entire range of possible amplitudes , while still using the methods from the small amplitude expansion .",
    "our expansion , which can also be thought of as a single frequency approximation , allows us to use results existing in the literature for time periodic , localized solutions .",
    "although interesting as classical solutions , a quantum treatment can lead to changes in oscillon lifetimes @xcite . another question worth investigating is the stability of oscillons coupled to other fields .",

    "we extend our results to @xmath2 dimensions .      in this section",
    "we extend the results of the previous section to a @xmath2-dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "although we are unable to obtain an analytic form for the profile , the important qualitative ( and some quantitative ) aspects of the solutions can still be understood .",
    "in particular , we derive a critical amplitude and frequency for which the solution becomes spatially homogeneous and argue that the relationship between the height and width is nonmonotonic .    the equation of motion ( assuming spherical symmetry ) is given by @xmath90 we can follow the same procedure used in the previous subsection to arrive at the equation for the profile @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",

    "the equation of motion takes on an intuitive form @xmath98 this means that as we move away from @xmath99 , we move from a higher @xmath100 trajectory to a lower one . with the requirement that the solution is  localized \" ( more specifically , @xmath101 as @xmath102 ) ,",
    "we need @xmath103 as @xmath102 . requiring that the solution is smooth at @xmath99 requires @xmath104 at @xmath99 .",

    "the @xmath112 ones are the oscillon profiles we are looking for .",
    "the numerically obtained profiles are shown on the right in fig .",
    "[ profile13d ] .    from figure [ width13d ] , it is easy to see that the relationship between the heights and widths of the oscillons is nonmonotonic .",
    "we know that for @xmath113 ( ie .",
    "@xmath114 ) , the usual small amplitude expansion yields solutions that have the property that their widths decrease with increasing amplitude .",
    "we also know that for @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) the width will be infinite .",
    "thus , as in the @xmath0-dimensional scenario , we expect the width to be a nonmonotonic function of the central amplitude .",
    "this is indeed what is seen from the numerical solutions of the profile equation as shown in fig .",
    "[ width13d ] .",
    "note that the width is a multivalued function of the amplitude beyond @xmath116 .",
    "nevertheless , it still approaches the homogeneous solution via the flat - top profiles .",
    "the multivalued relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is shown in fig .",
    "[ frequency ] .",
    "the oscillon solution does not solve the equation of motion exactly .",
    "we have ignored terms of @xmath117 $ ] as well as outgoing radiation .",
    "the problem of calculating the outgoing radiation in the small amplitude limit ( not the flat tops ) has been addressed in the literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our intention here is to point out that for flat tops , the radiation will still be small .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the amplitude of the outgoing radiation can be estimated by the amplitude of the fourier transform of the oscillon at the radiation wave number @xmath118 ( also see @xcite ) . for small amplitude oscillons ,",
    "this is exponentially small @xmath119 .",
    "let us estimate what changes are expected when we move to the flat - top oscillons .",
    "as we have seen , already our solutions have the form , @xmath120 where the function @xmath121 is independent of @xmath28 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath122 can be determined from the fourier transform of @xmath123 using @xmath124 now @xmath125 is determined entirely by @xmath38 .",
    "hence , for any given @xmath38 , the fourier transform of @xmath122 gets narrower as @xmath28 is increased .",
    "thus , by increasing @xmath28 we can make the amplitude at the radiating wave number as small as we want . note that even though the fourier transform of a flat - top oscillon resembles a `` sinc '' function , rather than a sech , this is true only for wave numbers near zero .",
    "since the flat top oscillons are smooth solutions , their fourier transforms still exhibit a rapid asymptotic decay .",
    "the argument in 3 + 1 dimensions will be similar .",
    "for the oscillons in @xmath0 ( left ) and @xmath2(right ) dimensions .",
    "the stability of oscillons is determined by the sign of @xmath126 where @xmath127 . note the important difference between the curves in the two cases .",
    "while all oscillons are stable to long wavelength perturbations in @xmath0 dimensions , this is not the case in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "only those with small frequency ( or equivalently , towards the flat - top regime ) are robust .",
    "frequency is measured in units of @xmath14.,width=624 ]    in this section we investigate whether oscillons are stable against small , localized perturbations . as discussed in the previous section , the periodic oscillon expansion , formulated in powers of @xmath31 , fails to solve the governing field equations and must expel radiation . in our stability analysis",
    "we ignore the effects of the exponentially suppressed radiation and focus on perturbing the oscillon profile .",
    "the main results of this section are as follows : ( i ) on the time scale of order @xmath28 , @xmath2-dimensional oscillons with large amplitudes are robust ( their small amplitude counterparts are not ) against localized perturbations with spatial variations comparable to the width of the oscillon .",
    "( ii ) for small wavelength perturbations ( compared to the width of of the oscillon ) , instabilities _ could _ exist in discrete , extremely narrow bands in @xmath128 space .",
    "we now provide the details essential for reaching the above conclusions .",
    "as done previously , we discuss the @xmath0-dimensional case first , and then extend the results to @xmath2 dimensions . starting with a fixed oscillon profile @xmath129",
    "( [ sol1d ] ) ] , we linearize about the oscillon by an arbitrary function @xmath130 . provided the field @xmath130 remains smaller than @xmath129 , the linearized dynamics will approximately describe the perturbation .",
    "let @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the amplitude of the perturbation and we keep @xmath133 .",
    "note that for a linear analysis , @xmath130 must also vanish at infinity so that the perturbation @xmath134 remains smaller than the original oscillon .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis to spatially localized perturbations .",
    "the field @xmath130 then satisfies @xmath135 we now wish to determine if all initial conditions @xmath130 remain bounded , or whether there exists an unstable initial profile @xmath136 .",
    "the @xmath137 terms act as periodic forcing functions oscillates in time , the problem is essentially one of parametric resonance stability / instability .",
    "we are really diagonalizing the floquet matrix - which in this case would really be an integral operator . ] .",
    "this periodic forcing , somewhat analogous to pumping ones legs back and forth on a swing , may deposit energy into the field @xmath130 and consequently excite an instability .",
    "a complete treatment of stability may require one to solve ( [ chifield ] ) for a complete basis of initial conditions .",
    "because of the spatially dependent oscillon solution , a fourier analysis is difficult . with this in mind , we split the set of initial conditions into two groups .",
    "the first with spatial variations comparable to the size of the oscillons and another which varies on much shorter length scales . in the second case we can approximate the oscillon as a spatially constant oscillating background .",
    "this allows us to carry out a standard floquet analysis .",
    "such an analysis reveals the most dangerous instability band at @xmath138 , with a width @xmath139 . for large @xmath28 , this becomes extremely narrow .",
    "in addition , we expect the time scale of these instabilities to be @xmath140 .",
    "nevertheless , one should bear in mind that the slow spatial variation of the oscillon could still be important .",
    "now , let us look at the case where the perturbations vary on length scales comparable to the width of the oscillon in detail .",
    "note that to leading order , the forcing potential : @xmath141 is ( i ) @xmath142 $ ] , ( ii ) smoothly varying with a natural length @xmath143 , and ( iii ) oscillating with period @xmath144 in the variable @xmath145 .",
    "the first observation implies we may use perturbation theory and seek an expansion for @xmath130 in inverse powers of @xmath28 : @xmath146 in the following analysis we shall work out the linear instabilities to first order in @xmath147 .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that solutions stable to order @xmath147 , may in fact develop higher order instabilities over longer time scales .",
    "since we are interested in perturbation with wavelengths comparable to @xmath148 , we rescale the length @xmath149 . to capture the instability , however , we introduce two times : the original oscillatory time @xmath145 and a slow time @xmath150 provides the important slow time scale .",
    "a back of the envelop calculation is as follows - consider a homogeneous background oscillating at the oscillon frequency . a naive perturbation series for @xmath130 in powers of @xmath147 exhibits an oscillating term for @xmath151 , and then a term which grows linearly in @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "this means @xmath153 becomes the same order as @xmath151 when @xmath154 .",
    "hence , there is a characteristic slow time @xmath155 .",
