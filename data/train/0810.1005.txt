    "the concept of `` holography '' is first introduced by d.  gabor in 1948  @xcite as a new technique of the optical physics to playback the three - dimensional information onto the two - dimensional plate as a hologram . in 1997 , this concept of holography comes to get a new appearance in the framework of the superstring theory as the duality between two theories belonging to the different spatial dimensions .",
    "it is first proposed by maldacena  @xcite as the ads / cft correspondence between @xmath7 supergravity and @xmath8=4 susy yang - mills theory through @xmath9 brane in type iib superstring theory . in more general point of view , an essential element of the holography is `` @xmath10 brane '' as the @xmath11-dimensional membrane in the ten - dimensional space - time .",
    "in fact , @xmath10 brane appears as the soliton , i.e. , the condensed object of the fundamental strings .",
    "the @xmath10 brane has two important aspects as follows : @xmath11-dimensional gauge theory appears _ on _ a surface of the @xmath10 brane , and @xmath12-dimensional supergravity appears _ around _",
    "the @xmath10 brane .",
    "( the italic `` _ 1 _ '' denotes the radial dimension with non - trivial curvature around the @xmath10 brane , indicating the existence of the gravity ) .",
    "actually , the concept of holography indicates the duality between the @xmath11-dimensional gauge theory without the gravity and @xmath12-dimensional supergravity mediated by the @xmath10 brane , and the gauge interaction as a `` hologram '' on the surface of the @xmath10 brane is to give the supergravity as a `` vision '' in the extra - dimension .",
    "one of the most essential properties of the holography is the `` strong - weak duality '' between the gauge theory and the supergravity : the coupling strengths are transversely related with each other .",
    "therefore the holography provides a remarkable possibility that non - perturbative aspects of one side can be analyzed by the other dual side just with the tree - level calculations .",
    "then , if we find the special configurations of @xmath13 branes reflecting qcd on their surfaces , non - perturbative aspects of qcd can be successfully examined from the tree - level dual supergravity side .",
    "this is the strategy of the holographic qcd .",
    "there exist several trials to find the special configurations of @xmath13 branes reflecting qcd .",
    "eventually , in 2005 , sakai and sugimoto succeeded in constructing qcd with massless quarks and gluons from the fluctuation modes of the open strings on the d4/d8/@xmath14 multi - d brane configurations in type iia superstring theory  @xcite , called sakai - sugimoto model , which is one of the most realistic model of holographic qcd . by using this model , many phenomenological properties of _ mesons _ belonging to the non - perturbative aspects of qcd like meson mass spectra , hidden local symmetry  @xcite , vector meson dominance  @xcite , ksrf relation  @xcite , gsw model  @xcite , etc .",
    ", are successfully derived from the tree - level dual supergravity calculations . in this sense , holographic qcd is often regarded as the `` unified meson theory '' . on the other hand ,",
    "baryon description is not straightforward in this approach since the classical supergravity is found to be dual with the strong - coupling `` large-@xmath3 '' qcd , where baryons do not directly appear as dynamical degrees of freedom  @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we gave the first study of the baryon as a non - trivial topological soliton in the four - dimensional meson effective action derived from holographic qcd .",
    "we call this topological soliton as a `` brane - induced skyrmion ''  @xcite . especially we included pions and @xmath1 mesons appearing below the kaluza - klein mass scale @xmath2 , which is often called the `` truncated - resonance model '' for the baryon analysis .",
    "actually , @xmath15 plays the role as the ultraviolet cutoff scale of the holographic approach .",
    "in fact , there appear infinite number of `` non - qcd modes '' with mass scale @xmath16 in holographic qcd like gluinos and kaluza - klein modes . in this sense",
    ", the duality with qcd could be maintained below @xmath15 as the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "the appearance of certain cutoff scale @xmath15 should be essential for the holographic approach to be dual of realistic qcd with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking as the non - susy natures . in the holographic model with @xmath0 multi - d brane system ,",
    "d4 branes are @xmath17-compactifiled with @xmath15 scale , to give the complete susy breaking and its resulting non - conformal natures of qcd like finite string tension and chiral condensate .",
    "these considerations suggest that @xmath15 should be so much respected , giving our truncation of meson resonances at @xmath15 for baryon analysis ( see , sec .",
    "[ mea ] for details ) . recently",
    "a baryon is also described as an `` instanton '' on the five - dimensional gauge theory of d8 branes with d4 supergravity background  @xcite .",
    "the instanton is introduced _ before _ the mode expansion of the five - dimensional gauge field into mesons , so that the baryon as the instanton is to be composed by the infinite number of color - singlet modes with mesonic quantum number even above @xmath15 scale .",
    "however , we consider that such color - singlet modes above @xmath15 might not directly correspond to physical mesons in qcd , because the duality with qcd is mentained below @xmath15 . furthermore , there also exist infinite number of other non - qcd modes above @xmath15 , which could also affect the baryon properties if they were included . therefore , in contrast to instanton models , we severely respect the cutoff scale @xmath15 and truncate the meson resonances at @xmath15 , to keep the duality with qcd .",
    "more comprehensive discussions with instantons are summarized in sec .",
    "[ so ] .    in present work ,",
    "we newly consider the extension of the holographic model to dense qcd . due to the non - abelian nature of qcd ,",
    "various realizations are expected in the vacuum itself with finite temperature and density , called `` qcd phase diagram '' . up to now ,",
    "interesting phase structures are proposed by using some low - energy effective theories of qcd , e.g. , confined phase with mesons and baryons , deconfined phase with quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , chiral symmetry broken phase with mass generation  @xcite , color superconductivity as diquark condensation  @xcite , etc .",
    "in fact , some wisdom about qgp gives the insight for the early universe just after the big bang  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possible qcd phase transitions in the core region of neutron stars could affect a lot of their macroscopic features like moment of inertia , angle velocity , and breaking index  @xcite .",
    "there also exist several experimental projects to search the qgp in the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions in rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) at bnl , and lhc ( large hadron collider ) at cern .",
    "there will also appear relatively low - energy collision experiments to make the low - temperature high - density object in fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) at gsi , giving some knowledge about the core region of the compact stars . with these background",
    ", it should be urgently important to make clear the structure of qcd phase diagram more explicitly from qcd itself with the rich help of experimental data , which will eventually bring about the fundamental understanding of our whole nature .",
    "there exists the lattice qcd numerical study as the first principle calculation of the strong interaction .",
    "however , because of the `` sign problem '' , its applicability is severely restricted near the zero - density at finite - temperature regime of the wide qcd phase diagram ( for some review , see , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "if one succeeds in the extension of holographic approach to the dense regime , it should give a new analytical tool for non - perturbative aspects of the finite density qcd , where the holography provides the duality between the strong - coupling gauge theory and the weak - coupling supergravity .",
    "this is the main aim of our study .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the baryonic matter in holographic qcd as the extension of the holographic approach to dense qcd .",
    "especially , we treat the baryonic matter with large-@xmath3 because the holographic qcd is derived as a large-@xmath3 effective theory . as the general property of large-@xmath3 qcd  @xcite ,",
    "the static baryon mass is proportional to @xmath18 , so that its kinetic energy becomes @xmath19 .",
    "there also exist the quantum effects like the zero point quantum fluctuation energy @xmath20 and also the baryon mass splitting @xmath21 within the baryonic matter , while these correspond to the higher order contributions of the @xmath22 expansions as @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "such large-@xmath3 countings indicate that , for sufficiently large @xmath3 , the kinetic energy and the quantum effects within the baryonic matter can be suppressed relative to the static mass , and the baryonic matter comes into the static skyrme matter .",
    "such static skyrme matter was first analyzed by klebanov  @xcite , by placing the skyrme soliton solutions periodically along the three - dimensional cubic lattice , which would correspond to the nuclear crystal in the deeper interior of neutron stars .",
    "since the cubic lattice treatment is rather cumbersome , we employ a mathematical trick to analyze such static skyrme matter , proposed by manton and ruback  @xcite . in order to represent some high - density state of the multi - skyrmion system on the three - dimensional flat space @xmath25 , single skyrmion",
    "is alternately placed on a surface of the three - dimensional closed manifold @xmath4 with a finite radius .",
    "in fact , the multi - skyrmion system on @xmath25 and the single skyrmion on @xmath4 can be related with each other through the compactification of the boundary of a unit cell on @xmath25 shared by one skyrmion .",
    "the interactions between baryons on @xmath25 are simulated by the curvature of the manifold @xmath4 , and decreasing the radius of @xmath4 represents the increase of the baryon - number density in the medium in this modeling .",
    "actually , by taking such mathematical simplification , one could avoid some complicated analysis like monte carlo simulations on the three - dimensional cubic lattice  @xcite , and he can get some physical intuitions as for the baryonic matter qualitatively and even quantitatively  @xcite . therefore , by placing the single brane - induced skyrmion on the closed manifold @xmath4 , we try to analyze the typical features of baryonic matters in holographic qcd .",
    "especially , in this analysis , the roles of @xmath1 mesons in the dense baryonic matter will be examined in detail from the holographic point of view .",
    "there exist a lot of works about the extension of the holographic approaches to dense susy qcd ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . with the bottom - up construction of the ads / qcd models  @xcite ,",
    "it was applied to dense qcd by introducing the bi - nucleon condensate  @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the sakai - sugimoto model  @xcite as one of the most reliable holographic top - down approaches to non - susy qcd with massless quark flavors , there exist several proposals about the extension of this model to dense qcd .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the baryon chemical potential @xmath26 is introduced by the asymptotic value of a @xmath27 gauge field on the d8-@xmath28 branes as @xmath29 , similarly to the introduction of the chemical potentials to the chiral perturbation theory by promoting the global chiral symmetry to local gauge one  @xcite . in these holographic analyses , the density dependence of the `` local '' properties of mesons and baryons like their masses and coupling constants , and also the phase structure of qcd",
    "have been successfully discussed .",
    "now , in our paper , we treat the baryon as a `` non - local '' solitonic object as the skyrmion in the sakai - sugimoto model , and we analyze the dense qcd by the skyrme matter . therefore , adding to the informations about the local natures of hadrons and qcd phase structure , we can extensively examine the internal structure of the baryon like the size and the field configurations .",
    "here we show the organization of this paper and its brief summary . in sec .",

    "[ so ] is devoted to summary and outlook . in this final section ,",
    "we compare our truncated - resonance approach with another `` instanton '' description of baryons @xcite in the holographic qcd , paying attention on the role of cutoff scale @xmath35 .",
    "in this section , we overview the derivation of the four - dimensional meson effective action from holographic qcd with @xmath0 multi-@xmath13 brane system in type iia superstring theory , called the sakai - sugimoto model  @xcite .",
    "the meson effective action is derived without small amplitude expansion to discuss a baryon as a large amplitude chiral soliton .",
    "( for more comprehensive derivations , see our previous paper  @xcite ) . here",
    "we especially emphasize the roles of cutoff scale @xmath15 in holographic qcd .",
    "first , we review the construction of @xmath0 multi - d brane system and also the supergravity description of d4 branes as the holographic dual of qcd . as the first step ,",
    "@xmath3 sheets of d4 branes are prepared to construct the gluon sector of qcd .",
    "the d4 branes are @xmath36-compactified along one extra - dimension with a radius as the inverse of the kaluza - klein mass scale @xmath15 .",
    "there appear ten independent fluctuation modes from the open strings on the surface of d4 branes , i.e. , gauge fields @xmath37 , scalar fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and also their superpartners as fermions . by imposing the anti - periodic boundary conditions for all the fermions along the @xmath36-compactified direction",
    ", they acquire large masses @xmath16",
    ". then supersymmetry ( susy ) is completely broken and , due to the radiative corrections , all the scalar fields @xmath38 and @xmath40 also get large masses @xmath16 . because of the @xmath36-compactification , there also appear the infinite number of the kaluza - klein modes with masses @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , below the @xmath15 scale , only massless gauge fileds @xmath41 appears . in this sense",
    ", the system of @xmath3 sheets of d4 branes with the @xmath36-compactification can be viewed as the @xmath42 yang - mills theory below @xmath15 scale , corresponding to the pure gauge sector of qcd . as the next step , @xmath43 sheets of d8 and @xmath28 branes",
    "are added to introduce the massless quark flavors of qcd . @xmath28",
    "has opposite chirality relative to d8 , providing @xmath44 chiral symmetry in this model . from the fluctuation modes of open strings between d4 and d8 ( @xmath28 ) ,",
    "there appear massless chiral fermions as quarks in qcd . as a whole",
    ", massless qcd appears as the `` hologram '' on the surface of @xmath0 branes .",
    "then we shift into the gravitational description of d branes from the extra - dimensions .",
    "the d brane is originally introduced as the fixed edges of open strings with dirichlet boundaries .",
    "this also indicates that , through the `` open - closed duality '' for the fundamental strings , the d brane can also be regarded as the source of closed strings , giving the graviton in the extra - dimensions outside of the d brane . in this sense ,",
    "the d brane can be identified as a highly gravitational system , i.e. , the `` black brane '' , allowing the gravitational description from the extra - dimensions .",
    "in fact , the mass of the d branes is proportional to its sheets number , so that , by assuming @xmath45 , only d4 branes can be represented by the gravitational background and d8 ( @xmath28 ) branes are introduced as the probes called `` probe approximation '' , which corresponds to the quenched approximation in lattice qcd study  @xcite . especially the classical supergravity description of d4 branes is tractable , followed by the local approximation of the strings and also the suppressions of the string loop effect .",
    "these conditions in the gravitational side around the d branes give the constraints for the gauge theory side as the qcd on the surface of d branes as @xmath46 which is achieved by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and thooft coupling : @xmath49 fixed and large . in this sense",
    ", the strong - coupling large-@xmath3 qcd is found to be dual with the classical supergravity of d4 branes with probe d8 ( @xmath28 ) branes , which is one of the realization of the strong - weak duality between the gauge theory and gravitational theory through the holography .",
    "therefore , by analyzing the effective action of d8 branes with d4 supergravity background around the d branes , one can analyze the nonperturbative aspects of qcd on the surface of d branes .",
    "then we start formal discussions from the @xmath50 non - abelian dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action of probe @xmath51 brane with @xmath52 supergravity background as a probe approximation . after dimensional reductions",
    ", the nine - dimensional dbi action of the probe @xmath51 brane with the @xmath52 supergravity background can be reduced into a five - dimensional yang - mills theory , belonging to the flat four - dimensional euclidean space - time @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 and the other fifth dimension @xmath55 with curved measures as follows  @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gauge field and @xmath58 } $ ] ( @xmath59 ) is the field strength tensor in five - dimensional space - time @xmath60 of the probe @xmath51 branes . in the action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath61 unit is taken , and the overall factor @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 ( note here that we use the value of @xmath62 as a half of that in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking away the misleading factor @xmath64 in eq.(16 ) of ref .",
    "all the formula and numerical results can be scaled by the factor @xmath62 , so that the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite are not altered . )",
    "the functional @xmath65 in the action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) expresses the nontrivial curvature in the extra fifth dimension @xmath55 induced by the supergravity background of the d4 brane .",
    "the gravitational energy of @xmath51 brane , i.e. , @xmath66 is subtracted in the action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) as the vacuum relative to the gauge sectors .    in the @xmath0 multi-@xmath13 brane configurations ,",
    "color quantum number is carried only by the @xmath3-folded @xmath52 branes .",
    "therefore , after the supergravity description of @xmath52 branes , there is no colored particles from the fluctuation modes of open strings on the residual probe @xmath51 branes .",
    "this is regarded as some holographic manifestation of `` color confinement '' in low - energy scale of qcd .",
    "in fact , gauge field @xmath67 in the action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) is color - singlet and obeys the adjoint representation of @xmath68 group , eventually producing the meson degrees of freedom after some proper mode expansions in the holographic qcd .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the non - trivial leading order of @xmath22 and @xmath69 expansions in the holographic qcd as the five - dimensional yang - mills action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) with @xmath70 . in general",
    ", there also exists the chern - simons ( cs ) term to avoid anomalies in the superstring theory . by introducing @xmath71 meson degrees of freedom as the @xmath72 sector of @xmath1 meson fields in the holographic approach , @xmath71 meson indirectly couples with pions via ( axial ) vector mesons after the proper mode expansions of cs term , which is regarded as a general representation of the gell - mann - sharp - wagner ( gsw ) model  @xcite .",
    "the roles of @xmath71 mesons for low - energy meson dynamics and also chiral solitons have been traditionally examined in some of qcd phenomenologies  @xcite .",
    "actually , however , the cs term is found to be @xmath73 , i.e. , the higher order contributions of thooft coupling expansion relative to the @xmath70 of the yang - mills action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) with @xmath74 , which is manifestly shown in holographic qcd .",
    "furthermore , most part of cs term includes one time - derivative of pion fields and does not affect the static properties of hedgehog solitons .",
    "therefore we neglect the cs term along the discussions below for the argument of the non - perturbative ( strong coupling ) properties of qcd .    in the holographic approach",
    ", the pion field is introduced as the wilson line of the fifth gauge field @xmath75 , i.e. , a path - ordered product of the fifth gauge field along the @xmath55 direction  @xcite as @xmath76 one can also introduce the variables @xmath77 as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a single - valued arbitrary function of @xmath80 .",
    "then the pion field ( [ pion1 ] ) can be written as @xmath81 some resemble formula of which can also be found in the traditional approach of hidden local symmetry  @xcite .",
    "now we take `` @xmath82 gauge '' and also `` @xmath83 gauge '' for the @xmath68 gauge symmetry in the action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) of the probe @xmath51 brane .",
    "the @xmath82 gauge is similar to the unitary gauge in the non - abelian higgs theory ; fifth gauge field @xmath75 performs as a scalar field in four - dimensional space - time @xmath84 , and it is eaten by the four dimensional gauge field @xmath85 to give the mass generation of gauge field , especially the ( axial ) vector mesons as a part of @xmath85 . in this sense",
    "the masses of the ( axial ) vector mesons come from the higgs mechanism in five - dimensional space - time with the @xmath68 gauge symmetry breaking on the probe @xmath51 brane .",
    "the @xmath86 gauge is also essential to get the low - energy effective theory of qcd with proper parity and g - parity classification in a manifest way  @xcite . with these gauge fixings ,",
    "the five - dimensional gauge field @xmath87 can be mode - expanded into the four - dimensional parity and g - parity eigen states with proper complete orthogonal basis @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) as follows  @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are left and right currents of pion fields , respectively .",
    "the basis @xmath88 are introduced to support whole of the gauge field @xmath87 at the boundary @xmath94 as @xmath95 and @xmath96 as @xmath97 in order to diagonalize the five - dimensional yang - mills action ( [ 5dimdbi_2])with the induced measures @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the fifth dimension @xmath55 , the basis @xmath100 @xmath101 are taken to be the normalizable eigen - function satisfying @xmath102 with normalization condition as @xmath103 in the holographic model , the fields @xmath104 in the mode expansion ( [ limit2_lr ] ) are regarded as ( axial ) vector mesons , belonging to the adjoint representation of the @xmath68 gauge group as @xmath105 . by substituting the expansion ( [ limit2_lr ] ) into the action ( [ 5dimdbi_2 ] ) , the mass of @xmath106 field is found with the eigenvalue of oscillating fifth basis in eq.([eigen1 ] ) as @xmath107 , indicating that the origin of meson mass is the oscillation of meson wave function in the extra fifth dimension .",
    "furthermore , @xmath108 is the five - dimensional vector and @xmath89 are the parity eigen state in the @xmath55 direction as @xmath109",
    ". therefore , from the mode expansion ( [ limit2_lr ] ) , @xmath106 fields have four - dimensional parity transformation as @xmath110 .",
    "these consideration indicates that vector and axial vector mesons appear alternately in the excitation spectra about index @xmath111 as @xmath112 .    in our study",
    ", we construct the four - dimensional meson effective action only with pion field @xmath113 and @xmath1 meson field @xmath114 below the kaluza - klein mass scale @xmath2 .",
    "recall that there appear infinite number of non - qcd modes with large mass @xmath16 in holographic qcd , e.g. , scalar fields , gluino , and also the kaluza - klein modes , discussed in the first part of this section .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 multi - d brane system can be viewed as qcd as far as low energy phenomenology below @xmath115 is concerned . in this sense , @xmath15 plays the roles as the ultraviolet cutoff scale of the theory , so that we include the meson degrees of freedom below @xmath15 for the baryon analysis in later sections , called `` truncated - resonance model '' .",
    "actually , the appearance of @xmath15 scale with finite value seems to be essential in the recent holographic analysis . in the framework of ads",
    "/ cft correspondence without kaluza - klein compactification , the @xmath116 susy and its resulting conformal symmetry protect the emergence of the dimensional quantities like string tension and chiral condensate at the ground state , because of the cancellation of the radiative corrections between bosons and fermions . in this sense ,",
    "susy breaking is at lest needed to be dual of qcd with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking as its vacuum nature . in the sakai - sugimoto model , @xmath3 sheets of d4 branes",
    "are kaluza - klein compactified with radius @xmath117 , and the susy is completely broken by the field boundary condition along the compactified direction . therefore confinement and chiral symmetry breaking _ could _ occur as the non - susy gauge theory .",
    "in fact , the compactified d4 brane is `` non - bps '' , having a `` horizon '' in the supergravity description . in the holographic framework , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking _",
    "do _ occur on this horizon , giving the lost of `` colored '' information , and also the geometrical connection of d8 and @xmath28 branes . as a whole , the appearance of @xmath15 would be essential for the holographic model to be dual of realistic qcd .",
    "now , one may regret about the finiteness of @xmath15 as almost 1gev , which is comparable with the qcd mass scale @xmath118 . in the holographic approach ,",
    "the qcd mass scale is introduced by the experimental inputs for the pion decay constant and @xmath1 meson mass as @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "these experimental values come from our hadronic world with @xmath121 and large but finite thooft coupling @xmath122 , which may infringe the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) to give the effects of string length and string loops in the gravitational side .",
    "therefore , too large @xmath15 can not be taken to neglect the internal structure of strings on the surface of d4 branes compactified with radius @xmath117 , which might eventually gives the scale @xmath123 .",

    "+    in the previous section , we numerically find the swelling of the baryon by taking the skyrmion picture for the baryon analysis .",
    "actually , as discussed in sec .  [ bis_r3 ] , the skyrmion picture is naturally derived from qcd through the new concept of holography . therefore one can expect the swelling phenomenon in qcd itself . in this section , we try to give a qualitative explanation about the swelling mechanism of a baryon in terms of qcd , by especially referring to contexts of the lattice qcd  @xcite and also the finite density bag picture  @xcite .    first , in lattice qcd study , the non - perturbative qcd vacuum is analyzed within a finite box of periodic boundaries ( and also dirichlet boundaries ) in the euclidean space .",
    "the non - perturbative effects with long wave length tends to be `` blocked out '' from such finite box of definite boundaries , so that the qcd vacuum in the finite box is found to approach to the perturbative one .",
    "also , the finite - temperature phase transition in lattice qcd occurs because of the definite boundaries along the imaginary time axis in euclidean space ; as the temperature increases , the qcd vacuum in the euclidean space is more closely packed along the imaginary time axis to block out the non - perturbative effects with long wave length , which eventually gives the transition into the perturbative qcd vacuum , like the chiral symmetry restoration and also the deconfinement .",
    "next we combine the above picture into the finite density bag model , to explain the mechanism of the swelling in qcd . in the bag model , the baryon",
    "is represented by a `` bag '' with the perturbative qcd vacuum surrounded by the dirichlet boundaries , which is supported by the non - perturbative qcd vacuum with the bag pressure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fbag](a ) . as a number of bags increases , representing the high density baryonic matter ,",
    "the non - perturbative qcd vacuum around the bags is more closely packed within a definite region , imitated by a cube with dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_fbag](b ) .",
    "then , in analogy with the case of lattice qcd study discussed above , the qcd vacuum around the bags should approach to the perturbative one by blocking out the non - perturbative effects with long wave length as shown by the several waves in fig .",
    "[ fig_fbag ] .",
    "therefore the bag pressure as a non - perturbative effect decreases as the number of bags increases , so that it eventually gives the swelling of bags .",
    "such swelling in turn decreases the region of non - perturbative qcd vacuum around the bags to give the decrease of the bag pressure again . in this sense",
    ", such swelling could occur _ non - linearly _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rms ] , giving some drastic change of features like `` deconfinement '' in the baryonic matter .",
    "one can expect some resemblance between the finite density bag model and the skyrme matter in our study with respect to baryonic matter , so that the swelling phenomena as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rms ] could be understood on the same footing provided above .",
    "now we also suggest the physical effects of the swelling in the high density baryonic matter . here",
    "we take into account possible baryon excitation with the chiral soliton picture . since a moment of inertia of the baryon",
    "is related with the size of the baryon , some non - linear increase in the moment of inertia around critical density is expected along with the swelling of a baryon . in the semiclassical quantization procedure of a skyrme soliton , the baryon mass spectra is given  @xcite as @xmath255 where @xmath256 is static hedgehog mass and @xmath257 is the moment of inertia of a baryon .",

    "the baryon mass splitting in the second term in eq.([sqp ] ) is proportional to the inverse of the moment of inertia , indicating that a larger object can not be easily rotated .",
    "therefore we can now propose that the baryon mass splitting decreases as the density increases in the medium , because the moment of inertia @xmath257 increases due to the swelling .",

    "such lost of individuality may be regarded as some precursory phenomena of deconfinement , where the dominant degrees of freedom in the hadronic matter shifts from the confined composites as baryons ( and mesons ) into quarks and gluons .",
    "such swelling of the baryon leads to some interesting phenomenological realizations .",
    "as one possibility , here we propose the stable @xmath30-@xmath31 mixed matter in dense qcd . for simplicity , we consider the `` symmetric nuclear matter '' , where only the strong interaction is taken into account without the electro - magnetic interaction . in the low density case ,",

    "therefore , the non - perturbative effect with long wave length like the bag pressure would be blocked out from such definite region to give the swelling of the baryon .",
    "such swelling provides the the decrease of the baryon mass splitting , indicating the lost of the individualities for the baryons as the precursor of the deconfinement .",
    "we also propose the stable @xmath30-@xmath31 mixed matter in dense qcd because of the swelling , which could , e.g. , soften the eos of the neutron stars .",
    "the features of the delocalization phase transition and the chiral symmetry restoration are also analyzed with the order parameters in the holographic qcd .",
    "we conjecture with careful arguments that the delocalization phase transition can be related with the deconfinement of the baryons in qcd .",
    "then we find the coherence of the deconfinement and the chiral symmetry restoration through the meson field configurations .",
    "such coherence of the two phase transitions are also suggested in the lattice qcd study in the finite temperature  @xcite , the pnjl model as a low - energy effective theory of qcd  @xcite , and also the sakai - sugimoto model as one of the reliable holographic approaches  @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the critical densities of the phase transitions with the experimental inputs for the pion decay constant @xmath124 and @xmath1 meson mass @xmath125 as @xmath332 and @xmath333 .",
    "we find the critical densities as @xmath334 for the skyrme model and @xmath335 for the bis model .",
    "we can see that the larger baryon - number density is needed for the bis model to give the phase transitions , because of the shrinkage of total size of the baryon with heavy @xmath1 mesons in its core region .",
    "finally we compare our truncated resonance approach for the baryons with the other works of baryons as the _ instantons _ in holographic qcd .",
    "in fact , there seem to exist some conflicts for the baryon analysis in holographic qcd , especially between the truncated resonance model and the instanton models . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the baryons are studied as the instantons on the five - dimensional gauge theory of the probe d8 brane with d4 supergravity background as the holographic dual of qcd .",
    "the properties of the baryonic matter are also analyzed by the system of the single instanton on the three - dimensional closed manifold @xmath4 as the wigner - seiz approximation  @xcite . in these analyses ,",
    "the instanton is found to shrink into zero size only for the dbi sector of the effective action of the d8 brane , which corresponds to the leading order of large-@xmath3 and large thooft coupling expansions . in the holographic approach ,",
    "infinite tower of color - singlet modes with mesonic quantum numbers as @xmath1 , @xmath244 , @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , appears in the mode expansions of the five - dimensional gauge field @xmath340 on the d8 brane as in eq.([limit2_lr ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "the baryon as the instanton on the five - dimensional gauge theory before the mode expansion is in principle to be composed by the infinite tower of such color - singlet modes with mesonic quantum numbers .",
    "therefore , the instability of the instanton only with the dbi sector is often regarded that the infinite number of ( axial ) vector mesons @xmath1 , @xmath244 , @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , would affect the low - energy soliton feature to give the zero size . then ,",
    "in order to describe the baryon as an instanton with finite size in the holographic approach , the inclusion of the chern - simons ( cs ) sector of the effective action of the d8 brane is claimed , whereas the cs sector corresponds to the higher order contribution of the thooft coupling expansion relative to the dbi sector .",
    "however , as emphatically noted in sec .",
    "[ mea ] , the appearance of certain cutoff scale like @xmath2 in holographic approach should be essential to be dual of qcd .",
    "in fact , the mesonic mass spectra predicted from holographic qcd starts to deviate from the experimental data beyond the @xmath15 scale , indicating that the holographic duality with qcd is mainly maintained almost below @xmath15 .",
    "this tendency of the mass spectra also denotes that such color - singlet modes beyond cutoff scale @xmath15 do not directly correspond to physical mesons in qcd .",
    "therefore , one _ can not _ manifestly conclude that the instability of the instanton only with the dbi sector really arises from the physical effect in qcd .",
    "furthermore , there also exist the infinite number of non - qcd modes , e.g. , the kaluza - klein modes with large mass @xmath16 through the kaluza - klein compactification of the d4 brane  @xcite . therefore",
    ", if the baryon as the instanton is to be really composed by the infinite tower of the color - singlet non - qcd modes even beyond @xmath15 , there is no reason to cast away the kaluza - klein modes in the baryon analysis .",
    "in fact , such kaluza - klein modes still have the possibility to affect baryon properties , giving , e.g. , the stability of the instanton even without the cs sector of the effective action of the d8 brane , through it is not to be manifestly proved yet . as a whole , there still seems to remain puzzling conflicts between the truncated resonance model and instanton models for the baryon analyses in holographic qcd .    by looking back the long history of hadron physics , baryons seem to have inherent difficulties to be described relative to mesons . for example , the quark model succeeded in the systematic classification of the hadrons in terms of their valence quarks  @xcite .",
    "however , while the dynamics of mesons as the two - body composites can be relatively easily analyzed by solving the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite , we have to treat the complicated faddeev equation  @xcite to describe the dynamics of the baryons as the three - body composites .",
    "same difficulties are also found in the lattice qcd studies , for instance , with respect to the inter - quark potential of mesons  @xcite and baryons  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the quark - antiquark potential as the internal nature of the meson could be successfully measured in lattice qcd in 1980  @xcite , while it takes almost twenty years after that to find the well measurement of three - quark potential with the appearance of gluonic y - type flux tube as the internal nature of the baryon  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of the baryons gets more apparent in the large-@xmath3 qcd  @xcite , which has provided a powerful perturbative treatment with the @xmath22 expansion for the non - perturbative aspects of the strong interaction .",
    "in fact , large-@xmath3 qcd achieved large successes in the explanations for the hadron phenomenology , e.g. , the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule @xcite , the @xmath341 rule @xcite , and the narrowness of meson resonances @xcite .",
    "it also provided a quantitative formula for the large @xmath342 meson mass as the veneziano - witten formula @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the baryon does not even appear as the dynamical degrees of freedom in the large-@xmath3 qcd , because the baryon mass is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , @xmath3 quarks are needed to construct the su(@xmath3 ) color - singlet composite as a baryon only from quarks , while a meson can still be constructed as the two - body color - singlet composite from a quark and an antiquark . in the end",
    ", the baryon appears as a `` non - local object '' , i.e. , the soliton of the meson fields in the large-@xmath3 qcd . as a whole ,",
    "the baryons tend to suffer from the many - body difficulties relative to the mesons , by seeing the long hadron history .",
    "now , we suppose here that the recent baryon analyses in holographic qcd may suffer from the same kind of difficulties inherent in the baryon itself .",
    "in fact , meson properties are successfully described in the framework of holographic qcd as the sakai - sugimoto model  @xcite whereas the baryons seem to be not sufficiently described yet .",
    "one should note that the baryon mass splitting corresponds to the higher - order contributions of the large-@xmath3 expansion . in terms of the superstring theory ,",
    "such baryon mass splitting corresponds to the string loop effect beyond the classical supergravity , which is fairly untractable .",
    "these naive considerations imply that the baryon still drags the essential difficulties even by starting from the superstring theory .",
    "we have to sincerely reconsider the meaning of the difficulty existing in the baryon itself and identify an origin of the problems , which would inspire us to cure the recent conflicts of the baryon analyses in the holographic approach for the future .",
    "authors thank josh erlich and dong - pil min for their communications about our truncated resonance model as the baryon analysis in holographic qcd in comparison with the instanton models .",
