    "the work of norbert mller and alexej jerschow @xcite on nuclear spin noise imaging has reactivated the fundamental idea given by felix bloch @xcite in 1946 that n nuclei with magnetic moment @xmath4 can be measured because of `` statistically incomplete cancellation '' .",
    "a recent review on nuclear spin noise which corresponds to this idea can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to set the frame for a quantum mechanical description of an ensemble of @xmath5  identical non interacting spins  @xmath0 at finite temperature which experience the presence of main static and radio frequency ( rf ) magnetic fields in magnetic resonance experiments .",
    "we will recall the elementary quantum description of such a system which explains the small induced current by an ensemble of spins at equilibrium and the possibility to make nmr images without any rf magnetic field only with time dependent gradient magnetic fields .",
    "this derivation should be helpful for new magnetic resonance imaging sequences or for developing quantum computing by nmr .",
    "for one nuclear spin  @xmath0 in a @xmath6  magnetic field , the potential part of the hamiltonian is : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclear spin and @xmath9 is the spin that verifies the following equation : @xmath10 with @xmath11 a vector defined by the following pauli matrices : @xmath12 matrix notation of equation   is given by : @xmath13 by convention , the vector  @xmath14 is placed in the @xmath15-direction , that is @xmath16 and the @xmath17-plane is called the transverse plane .",
    "therefore the matrix form of the hamiltonian reduces to : @xmath18 the two eigenvalues of the hamiltonian  @xmath19 , which give the energy of the quantum states , are : @xmath20 and @xmath21 which have the following two corresponding eigenvectors : @xmath22 the wave function of one spin@xmath0 at time @xmath23 is : @xmath24 the 1 indice corresponds to the low energy or ground level .",
    "time evolution of this quantum system ( far from the speed of light ) is given by the schrdinger equation : @xmath25 if we write @xmath26 then we have the following differential equations : @xmath27 is the resonance or larmor frequency . the following time dependent wave function is the obvious solution of this system of equations : @xmath28 which defines the spin evolution time operator @xmath29 .      in nmr",
    ", a transition between the two states @xmath30 and @xmath31 is obtained by a @xmath32  magnetic field rotating in the transverse plane .",
    "@xmath32 is assumed to lie along the @xmath33-direction .",
    "this field is generated by an electromagnetic rf  wave obtained by an oscillating current in a solenoid surrounding the spin sytem . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian has non - diagonal elements due to the rf  magnetic field  @xmath34 rotating around  @xmath35 with an angular velocity  @xmath36 : @xmath37 in this case time evolution is no longer trivial .",
    "we have the following differential equations : @xmath38 in the time - independent case ( @xmath39 ) these equations reduce to equations  . for the time - dependent case",
    "we need to solve the following differential equations : @xmath40 to solve these two equations we make the following substitutions :    @xmath41    therefore we have :    @xmath42    when we take the second derivative of @xmath43 we obtain the following second order differential equation : @xmath44 let @xmath45 be the solutions of the equation @xmath46 we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 therefore :    @xmath49    a similar computation for @xmath50 leads to :    @xmath51    as @xmath52 verify initial values and the differential equations   we have : @xmath53 computation of the constants  @xmath54 is now straightforward and gives :    [ ccoef ] @xmath55    these expressions are simplified if the angular velocity  @xmath36 of the rf  magnetic field verifies the resonance condition @xmath56 and in this case we have @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "+ in general case we can write the evolution of the spin wave function in matrix notation as : @xmath59 where a matrix is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the complex conjugate of @xmath62 . in this equation",
    "it is possible to separate the evolution due to the rf frequency @xmath36 .",
    "we then obtain : @xmath63 or @xmath64 at the resonance frequency , the matrix @xmath65 reduces to : @xmath66 -i \\sin\\tfrac{\\omega_1 t}2&\\cos\\tfrac{\\omega_1 t}2   \\end{pmatrix}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] effect of an rf  pulse is usually described as a rotation @xcite with an angle of @xmath67 in the spin space around vector @xmath68 as : @xmath69 \\left ( -iu_x+u_y\\right)\\sin\\tfrac{\\theta_1}2 & \\cos\\tfrac{\\theta_1}2+iu_z \\sin\\tfrac{\\theta_1}2   \\end{pmatrix}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath70 lies in the transverse plane : @xmath71 where @xmath72-direction is given by the phase of the rf pulse ( in other words by the beginning of the rf pulse ) and therefore the rotation matrix becomes : @xmath73 -i\\sin\\tfrac{\\theta_1}2 & \\cos\\tfrac{\\theta_1}2   \\end{pmatrix}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that this is exactly the transformation matrix that we have computed at resonance in equation , except for the fact that the time evolution @xmath74 is missing in this equation .",
    "therefore in the general case , equation gives the evolution of the wave function and equation shows that the evolution of the spin system is a time evolution given by matrix @xmath74 which depends on the rf frequency followed by a rotation of angle @xmath75 around vector : @xmath76 it is important to note that this is a non - commutative product . in other words , the spin evolution in presence of an rf field is , according to equations and , a matrix product of a time evolution operator and a rotation operator .",
    "the wave function after the pulse is given by : @xmath77 which is the same as the equation derived in abragam textbook @xcite but here we have calculated explicitly the a matrix",
    ". therefore at resonance the wave function at the end of the rf pulse is equal to the wave function multiplied by the rotation matrix of angle @xmath78 which is then multiplied by the evolution matrix but there is no time sequence between these two operations . if this elementary description of the spin dynamic retrieve the main characteristic of nmr experiments , it is not complete .      as an hamiltonian corresponds to the sum of the potential and the kinetic energies of the physical system under investigation , the potential energy ( @xmath79 )",
    "must be completed by the kinetic energy ( @xmath80 ) or more precisely @xmath81 where f is a function of space and time dependent on the spin system . for our purpose",
    "we consider only the time dependence @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a scalar dependent on the absolute temperature for a macroscopic sample .",
    "it is well known that such a system obeys always the schrdinger equation .",
    "the complete hamiltonian for one spin is : @xmath84 and the schrdinger equation becomes : @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "+ here to solve these equations we make the following substitutions : @xmath87 which gives ( if @xmath88 and @xmath89 are time independent ) : @xmath90 these equations have the same solutions as equation with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the solution of these equations is : @xmath93 c_3 e^{i\\tfrac{\\delta -k}{2}t}+   c_4 e^{-i\\tfrac{\\delta + k}{2}t } \\end{pmatrix}=\\\\ \\nonumber & \\begin{pmatrix } e^{-i \\tfrac{k}{2}t}&0\\\\ 0&e^{-i \\tfrac{k}{2}t}\\\\ \\end{pmatrix } \\begin{pmatrix } c_1 e^{i\\tfrac{\\delta}{2}t}+c_2 e^{-i\\tfrac{\\delta}{2}t}\\\\[0.8em ] c_3 e^{i\\tfrac{\\delta } { 2}t}+c_4 e^{-i\\tfrac{\\delta } { 2}t }   \\end{pmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 are identical to the coefficients obtained in the previous case and given by equations   with exchanging @xmath95 by @xmath96 and @xmath97 by @xmath98 .",
    "this solution is again the product of an evolution matrix with a rotation matrix : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a matrix and not a scalar , and r is given by @xmath101 -i\\tfrac{k}{\\delta}\\sin\\tfrac{\\delta t}2 & \\cos\\tfrac{\\delta t}2+i\\tfrac{\\omega_0}{\\delta}\\sin\\tfrac{\\delta t}2 \\end{pmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the evolution of the wave function of one spin is given by the product of the spin evolution operator and a spin rotation of angle @xmath102 around @xmath103 . as the evolution operator is a rotation",
    "there is no oscillation between the two states , and without rf or static magnetic time evolution , it seems that no nmr signal can be detected .      in the general case",
    "the hamiltonian of a spin @xmath0 is dependent on the time evolution of the magnetic field @xmath104 and the kinetic energy @xmath82 , therefore it can be written as : @xmath105 and the schrdinger equation becomes : @xmath106 with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "+ we look for an adequate exponential substitution @xmath111 and @xmath112 which derivation gives :    [ general1 ] @xmath113 - \\tfrac i2 ( \\omega_x -i\\omega_y+k ) q e^{(a - b)}\\\\ \\dot{q}&= q \\left [ \\dot{b } + \\tfrac i2(\\omega_z - k ) \\right ] - \\tfrac i2 ( \\omega_x + i\\omega_y+k ) p e^{(b - a)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath114 , @xmath115 these equations simplify but the second derivation introduce a coupling between the two states :    [ general2 ] @xmath116    the constant solution of these equations corresponds to :    @xmath117    in case of constant magnetic field @xmath118 we retrieve equations and the comparison with these equations shows that the general derivation introduces a coupling of the kinetic energy and the x component of the magnetic field in case of non constant magnetic fields .",
    "the solutions of equations is , as usually , obtained by the constant solution then varying the constants .",
    "+ the constant solution of these equations , equivalent to equation , is :    [ general4 ] @xmath119    with @xmath120 where @xmath54 coefficients are given by equations with @xmath121 .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath122 is now the frequency difference with the reference frequency @xmath88 which is the resonant frequency at time @xmath123 .",
    "the explicit constant solution at each time @xmath124 is :    @xmath125    which verify @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .      for two spins",
    "we consider a four dimensional hilbert space which is a tensor product of the two dimensional hilbert spaces of the one spin system .",
    "as the energy is given by the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , energy conservation needs that the eigenvalues of the sum matrix is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues of each hamiltonian matrix .",
    "this property is obtained by the kronecker sum @xmath129 of two matrices which is defined by : @xmath130 with @xmath131 the tensor product with identity matrices @xmath132 of dimensions @xmath133 the first dimension of matrix @xmath134 and @xmath135 the second dimension of matrix @xmath65 .",
    "+ therefore the hamiltonian of the two spin system is : @xmath136 this description is the most general possible for two independent spins in a @xmath134 field .",
    "the description we have obtained for the wave function of two spins is easily generalized and the hamiltonian of @xmath5 spins is just the kronecker sum of the one spin hamiltonian : @xmath137 this property shows the importance of the hamiltonian of one spin which determines the dynamic of the whole free spin system .",
    "in nmr , the measurement of the spin system is obtained by the current induced in a tuned @xmath138 circuit which corresponds to the photon emission when a spin switch from the excited state to ground state .",
    "it is well known that after a @xmath139 pulse an electrical current is induced in the @xmath138 circuit , but even in absence of @xmath139 pulse , the presence of the sample can be detected by the nuclear - spin noise @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . this signal has even been used for imaging sample without any rf pulse @xcite but in this case we will see that the presence of magnetic field gradients explains an increase of the nmr signal which permits to obtain images with a relatively good signal to noise ratio . +",
    "in order to discuss the difference between these two cases , we calculate the probability of a spin to be in each state from equations and : @xmath140\\\\ \\nonumber x_1 \\bar{x_1}&=r_1 ^ 2 + \\sin \\tfrac{\\delta}2 t \\left [ r_1 ^ 2 a+ r_2 ^ 2 \\tfrac{\\omega_1 ^ 2}{\\delta^2 } \\sin \\tfrac{\\delta}2 t - 2 \\tfrac{\\omega_1}{\\delta } r_1 r_2",
    "b   \\right]\\\\ \\nonumber   & \\text{with}\\\\ \\nonumber   a&=\\sin \\tfrac{\\delta}2 t ( \\tfrac{\\omega_z^2}{\\delta^2 } - 1)\\\\   \\nonumber   b&=(\\cos \\tfrac{\\delta}2 t \\sin(\\phi_1- \\phi_2 ) + \\tfrac{\\omega_z}{\\delta}\\sin \\tfrac{\\delta}2 t \\cos(\\phi_1- \\phi_2 )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that the probability of a spin to be in one state is periodic around the value at t=0 and the period is @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the probability for a spin to switch from a state to the other depends on the value of @xmath142 . for a free spin in a very homogeneous magnetic field @xmath143 ( remember that @xmath144 and the probability for a spin to change from one state to the other at a rate greater than the spontaneous oscillation between the two states is @xmath145 . in presence of a rf magnetic field , we are in the case where @xmath146 and at resonance the probability to change from one state to the other is 1 because @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath89 are small compared to @xmath88 .",
    "after the first observation of random noise emission from nuclear spins by sleator , hahn , hilbert and clarke @xcite , @xcite using a superconducting squid , mccoy and ernst @xcite have observed nuclear spin noise at room temperature using a conventional ( 300 mhz ) nmr spectrometer .",
    "they compared the proton resonance of the methyl group in ethanol without any rf pulse just by co - adding 8000 spectra with a conventional one pulse spectra .",
    "the most surprising features of the spectrum without any rf is the negative deviation compared to the spectrum obtained by a @xmath149 pulse excitation and the amplitude of the signal which is about @xmath150 time smaller .",
    "our elementary derivation retrieves this main characteristics .",
    "+ without rf and no field inhomogeneity , the probability for a spin to emit a photon is given by @xmath151 , as @xmath152 where @xmath83 is the kinetic energy of a proton @xmath153 therefore the probability of a nmr signal detection is @xmath154 for protons in a 300 mhz magnetic field as in the mccoy and ernst experiment .",
    "this probability is very small therefore in case of a great number of spins the statistical fluctuations around the mean values of @xmath155 and @xmath156 gives a squared probability which is @xmath157 .",
    "the minus sign gives the deviation from the probability to find the spin in a state at @xmath123 . in case of a rf magnetic field at resonance",
    "the probability is one and the deviation from state at t=0 is positive .",
    "the elementary description of the spin motion retrieves the main characteristics of a spin noise spectrum compared to the spectrum obtained with a @xmath149 pulse .      in imaging experiments ,",
    "magnetic gradient fields are applied in all space directions as in the work of mller and jerschow @xcite or in the three main direction as in phase encoding imaging thechnics . in this case a first gradient is applied in the x - direction with a rf pulse in order to select a slice with its thickness , after that a gradient is applied in a orthogonal direction in order give a phase coherence and after that a gradient is applied in the third orthogonal direction during signal acquisition .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] gives the schematic of one of the simplest imaging sequence .",
    "the first line corresponds to the rf channel where `` om '' is the synchronization of the lock - in detector with rf , the gaussien pulse shape is the red line and ( o ) corresponds to the acquisition of the current induced in the nmr receiver .",
    "the second line corresponds to the applied magnetic field gradients in blue for the @xmath158 ( or slice ) direction , in red for the @xmath159 ( or phase ) direction and in green for the @xmath160 ( or read ) direction . when applying gradients the exact synchronization on the reference frequency @xmath88 is mandatory to have the @xmath123 values and the same x - direction for each phase encoding step or gradient orientation .",
    "image a of figure  [ fig:2 ]        is the conventional nmr image of a test object composed of two lego pieces in water with 1g / l @xmath161 and agar / agar 10",
    "images of 128x128 pixels was obtained on a bruker 7 t bs70/30 small animal imaging system .",
    "image a of figure ( 2 ) was obtained with field of view of 58 mm corresponding to a magnetic field gradient of 2 @xmath162 t / m , a slice thickness of 1.16 mm , and an echo - time of 3.9 ms with a repetition - time of 8 ms corresponding to an acquisition - time of 1s 23ms .",
    "the rf pulse used was a gaussian pulse of 15 mw power corresponding to a flip angle of @xmath163 .",
    "the signal to noise ratio in image a is 18.1 .",
    "image b of figure  [ fig:2 ] was acquired with the same parameters except that there was no rf pulse ( power excitation pulse < @xmath164 ) , in this case the signal to noise ratio is 5.0 .",
    "we see from equations that nmr images can be obtained without rf magnetic field due to the fact that the probability to emit a photon by the spin system is not very different with or without rf because @xmath97 without rf is @xmath165 and with rf @xmath166 . in effect in presence of magnetic field gradients @xmath97 is not very different in both cases because @xmath167 is always small compared to @xmath168 and the variation of @xmath169 .",
    "an adequate discussion of the enhancement of the nmr signal with and without a rf pulse needs a precise description of the magnetic properties of the system under investigation and the information on spatial distribution of the spins , but the important result is that nmr imaging with good signal to noise ratio can be obtained without any rf magnetic field",
    ". such imaging sequence can be of great medical interest for decreasing rf power deposition in a patient .",
    "this work has shown that an elementary approach of the quantum description of an ensemble of independent spin @xmath170 can retrieve the magnetic resonance basic experimental facts .",
    "this derivation completes the density matrix formalism which is well adapted for describing all nmr experiments where spin coupling has important effects .",
    "experiments using nuclear spin noise are difficult to be explained by the matrix density formalism without introducing an extra probability factor and a stochastic operator as in the paper of field and bain @xcite",
    ". a precise description of nmr quantum effects should participate to the quantum mechanic fundamental aspects used in the development of quantum computing where nmr is still the only example of an experimental quantum computer working with more than ten qubits .",
    "the main result of our approach is to predict that the quantum interference effects are best detected in very homogeneous magnetic field without any rf pulse .",
