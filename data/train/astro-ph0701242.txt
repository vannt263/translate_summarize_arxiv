    "as shown in figure  [ fig : op1 ] , the spectrum of oph  1622@xmath02405a is poorly matched by both m9v and m9v+m9iii , as well as the m9 taurus member kpno  12 @xcite .",

    "however , their analysis did not further refine the age of the system and they did not claim to accurately measure the gravities and ages of oph  1622@xmath02405a and b , and instead assumed membership in ophiuchus . on the other hand , @xcite constrained the gravity of oph  1622@xmath02405a and b more tightly by comparing their data to kpno  4 ( @xmath9  myr ) and @xmath23  ori  51 ( @xmath10  myr ) .",
    "this comparison indicated that oph  1622@xmath02405a and b are older than kpno  4 and similar in age to @xmath23  ori  51 , which is in agreement with the age constraints that we have derived in this section .",
    "the analysis of gravity - sensitive lines in ",
    "[ sec : grav ] demonstrated that oph  1622@xmath02405a is older than taurus ( @xmath9  myr ) , which in turn is older than the stellar population within the ophiuchus cloud core ( @xmath11  myr , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , oph  1622@xmath02405 is not a member of the current generation of stars forming within the ophiuchus cloud , which is consistent with the low extinction of this binary ( @xmath24 ) and its large angular distance from the cloud core ( @xmath25 ) . instead ,",
    "oph  1622@xmath02405 probably is part of an older population of stars in the sco - cen complex , which contains several neighboring and overlapping generations of stars with ages from @xmath26 to 20  myr @xcite .",
    "for instance , oph  1622@xmath02405 is within the area encompassed by known members of upper sco @xcite and is near a population of exposed young stars distributed across the front of the ophiuchus cloud , which is coeval with upper sco and may be an extension of it @xcite .",
    "although we can not definitively identify the origin of oph  1622@xmath02405 nor measure its distance , membership in upper sco is likely based on its location and surface gravity diagnostics .",
    "indeed , this evidence of membership in upper sco is the same as for previously reported late - type members @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of estimating their luminosities , we assign to oph  1622@xmath02405a and b the distance of upper sco , which extends from 125 to 165  pc @xcite . based on the comparison of the optical spectra of oph  1622@xmath02405a and b to spectra of other young late - type objects in   [ sec : class ] , we find that the extinction of each component is @xmath24 .",

    "our luminosity measurements for oph  1622@xmath02405a and b are listed in table  [ tab : data2 ] .    to examine the ages implied by their luminosities , we plot oph  1622@xmath02405a and b on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] with the evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have converted our optical spectral types to effective temperatures with a temperature scale that is compatible with these models for young objects @xcite .",
    "the data and models in figure  [ fig : hr ] imply ages of 10 - 30  myr for the primary and 1 - 20  myr for the secondary .",
    "thus , these results are consistent with coevality for the two objects , which is expected for a binary system .",
    "these ages are somewhat older than the canonical value of 5  myr that is usually quoted for upper sco , but the age of a young population is sensitive to how it is defined , the mass range of objects considered , and the choice of models .",
    "to reliably compare the inferred ages of oph  1622@xmath02405a and b to those of upper sco members , the luminosities and temperatures of this binary should be compared directly to those of late - type members of upper sco .",
    "we do this by including in figure  [ fig : hr ] the late - type members of upper sco from @xcite .",
    "the lower limits of the sequence in temperature and luminosity are reflections of the detection limits of the survey from @xcite .",
    "an extension of the sequence below these limits in a manner that is parallel to the theoretical isochrones would encompass both components of oph  1622@xmath02405 .",
    "in other words , the model ages of the more massive members of the upper sco sequence from @xcite are consistent with the model ages of oph  1622@xmath02405a and b. similarly , the binary components fall within the sequence of low - mass upper sco members in the color - magnitude diagram from @xcite .",
    "in addition to ages , the evolutionary models in figure  [ fig : hr ] also provide estimates of masses , implying values of 0.055@xmath20.01 and @xmath28  @xmath6 for oph  1622@xmath02405a and b , respectively .",
    "the quoted uncertainties reflect only the uncertainties in spectral types and luminosities .",
    "additional systematic errors could be introduced by the adopted temperature scale and evolutionary models .",

    "the mass estimated for oph  1622@xmath02405a by @xcite is similar to our value , while her estimate for the secondary was twice our value because of the earlier spectral type that she derived . meanwhile ,",

    "the validity of higher estimates is supported by the fact that oph  1622@xmath02405a is only slightly cooler than the composite of the eclipsing binary brown dwarf 2 m  0535 - 0546a+b ( figure  [ fig : op1 ] ) and thus should have a comparable mass ( @xmath29 and 0.034  @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral types , temperatures , luminosities , and masses of oph  1622@xmath02405a and b produced by our analysis are compiled in table  [ tab : data2 ] .",

    "our analysis of gravity - sensitive absorption lines in the spectra of oph  1622@xmath02405a have demonstrated that this system is too old to be a member of the ophiuchus star - forming region ( @xmath11  myr ) . instead , the age constraints from those data combined with the position of oph  1622@xmath02405 on the h - r diagram are consistent with membership in upper sco ( @xmath10  myr ) . additional observations ( e.g. , proper motions , radial velocities ) are needed to better determine the origin and membership of this binary system . if the distance of upper sco is adopted for oph  1622@xmath02405 , then the separation of @xmath12 for this binary corresponds to @xmath34  au , making it the second young wide binary brown dwarf to be found .",
    "thus , oph  1622@xmath02405 is very similar to 2 m  1101 - 7732 in both mass and separation but is somewhat older ( 5  myr versus 1  myr ) . given the advanced age of this system compared to most disk - bearing stars and brown dwarfs , the disk detected in oph  1622@xmath02405 by @xcite is a valuable laboratory for studying the evolution of brown dwarf disks .",
