    "the cerebral cortex is an important part of the mammalian brain , and it is the outer covering of gray matter over the brains hemispheres . it is responsible for cognitive tasks like emotion , complex thought , memory , language comprehension , and consciousness @xcite . in the literature , it is possible to find information about the structure of the cerebral cortex network for the macaque monkey @xcite , c. elegans @xcite , the cat @xcite , etc .",
    "the cat cerebral cortex connectivity data was first published by scannell and young @xcite . the cat corticocortical network can be separated into 65 areas , and the areas are connected by fibres of different densities that can be described thought a connection matrix .",
    "the areas are separated into four clusters or cognitive regions named as visual , auditory , somatosensory - motor , and frontolimbic .",
    "we have studied a model of neuronal network that contains a connectivity configuration in accordance with the cat matrix @xcite .",
    "the clusters formed by cortical areas with common functional roles are responsible for the complexity of the cat network @xcite . with this in mind",
    ", we consider that each element of the matrix has a sub - network with small - world property @xcite .",
    "small - world network is clustered like regular networks wich has a path length comparable to random networks .",
    "the short path length is due to the existence of long - range connections .",
    "stam and collaborators @xcite presented studies about the presence of small - world characteristics in functional brain networks , as well as they also presented that alzheimer s disease is characterised by a loss of small - world property .",
    "epilepsy in small - world network was investigated by netoff and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they modelled activity in hippocampal slices considering small - world networks of excitatory neurons that reproduce bursts and seizures .",
    "in recent years , mathematical models to describe neuronal networks have been studied very intensively .",
    "neuronal mathematical models can take many forms , e.g. differential equations such as the hodgkin - huxley model @xcite and hindmarsh - rose model @xcite , as well as models with discrete time as the rulkov map @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider a coupled rulkov map network that presents not only discrete time , but also discrete space .",
    "the rulkov map presents two different time scales , where the variable with slow dynamics is responsable for the modulation of bursts in the fast variable @xcite .",
    "networks of coupled rulkov maps have been used in studies about neuronal phase synchronisation @xcite , suppression of bursting synchronisation @xcite , and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "neuronal synchronisation can be found in neuronal activities due to coupling among neurons or by means of common inputs .",
    "studies have demonstrated the importance of synchronisation of oscillatory phases between different brain regions in memory processes @xcite .",
    "roelfsema et al .",
    "@xcite realised studies recording local field potentials from electrodes implanted in the cortex of cats .",
    "they verified large - scale synchronisation when cats were submitted to a sudden change of a visual pattern .",
    "synchronisation in ensembles was also studied by ivanchenko et al .",
    "@xcite , who observed a second - order phase transition to synchronisation .",
    "axmacher et al .",
    "@xcite verified that specific forms of cellular plasticity during subsequent stages of memory formation are induced by synchronisation .",
    "nevertheless , there are evidences that certain brain disorders are related to neuronal synchronisation , e.g. epilepsy that results from high and extended synchronisation @xcite .",
    "moreover , synchronisation of neuronal activity is a common finding in patients with parkinson s disease @xcite .",
    "levy et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that parkinsonian patients present synchronised high - frequency activity in the subthalamic nucleus .    in face of neuronal synchrony in brain disorders ,",
    "we study here three methods to suppress undesired synchronisation : delayed feedback control , external time - periodic driving , and activation of selected neurons .",
    "the delayed feedback control was proposed by rosenblum and pikowsky @xcite to suppress synchronised pathological brain rhythms through delayed feedback signal @xcite .",
    "batista et al .",
    "@xcite observed that feedback control in networks of hodgkin - huxley - type neurons with chemical synapses can present more energy saving when compared to other suppression methods .",
    "feedback control is a method that has been implemented in clinical applications by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging based neurofeedback @xcite . with regard to external time - periodic driving",
    ", it was verified that electrical stimulation of deep brain structures can reduce or completely suppresses seizures @xcite .",
    "in addition , the method about activation of selected neurons was used by han and boyden @xcite .",
    "they used light pulses on genetically targeted neurons not only for activation , but also for inhibition of neuronal activity .",
    "all in all , we consider a clustered network that is composed by the matrix of corticocortical connections in the cat with small - world sub - networks using as local dynamics a two - dimensional map to describe the neuronal activity .",
    "we build small - world sub - networks according to the procedure proposed by newman and watts @xcite , who inserted randomly chosen shortcuts in a regular network . with the objective of finding an effective way of suppression of neuronal synchronisation",
    ", we study 3 methods : external time - periodic signal , neuron control with light , and time - delayed feedback signal .",
    "one of our main numerical results is to show that the time - delayed feedback signal is more effective than the control with light and feedback signal in the cat cerebral cortex .",
    "we also verify that a perturbation in the frontolimbic region affects the other regions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we present the mathematical model of the neuronal network .",
    "section 3 shows the burst phase synchronisation .",
    "section 4 exhibits our numerical results with the different methods of suppression of neuronal phase synchronisation . in the last section ,",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider , as neuronal model , the rulkov map @xcite that reproduces neuronal bursting by means of two variables , and is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fast dynamical variable , @xmath2 is the slow dynamical variable , @xmath3 controls the duration of bursts , @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the slow time - scale .",

    "the visual region is composed of 18 cortical areas and the auditory of 10 areas , while the somatosensory - motor and the frontolimbic present 18 and 19 cortical areas , respectively .",
    "the values of percentages , in figure [ fig2 ] , describe the amount of connections between regions in relation to the total connectivity in the matrix . for instance , inside the visual region there is @xmath13 of the total connectivity , and the percentage of connections to the visual region from the auditory region is equal to @xmath14 .",
    "the frontolimbic region has the largest amount of connections in the cat matrix .        in this work ,",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the time average order parameter as a function of the chemical coupling strength for each cortical region , where the value of the electrical coupling @xmath58 .",
    "we can see that the values of saturation of @xmath59 for the visual and the somatosensory - motor regions are larger than those of the auditory and frontolimbic regions .",
    "the auditory region presents a small percentage of intra connections , and due to this fact it is not possible to observe a strong synchronised state .",
    "consequently , the time average order parameter saturates in a value smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , we also observe that all transitions are of second - order .     for a fixed electrical coupling @xmath58 .",
    "we consider @xmath61 iterations where the first @xmath62 were excluded as transient.,width=302,height=188 ]",
    "the neuronal synchronisation can be associated with brain disorders , such as epilepsy and parkinson s disease . due to this fact",
    ", we have studied methods of suppression of neuronal phase synchronisation . as diagnostic tool of suppression",
    "we use the suppression factor @xcite , given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the variance , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the mean fields of the fast dynamical variable @xmath1 in the absence and presence of the control , respectively .",
    "the variance of @xmath66 is small when the synchronisation is suppressed , consequently the suppression factor @xmath67 is strongly increasing .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath67 has a value approximately equal to one when the control is not efficient to suppress the synchronisation .",
    "we have considered three methods of suppression that are found in literature : delayed feedback control , external time - periodic driving , and activation of selected neurons .",
    "* in the delayed feedback control , the last term in eq .",

    "the third method is similar to light stimulation , in other words , the neuron receives a light pulse and goes to a state where it is forced to spike . in our simulations , @xmath9 randomly chosen neurons are activated ( @xmath74 ) in a specific cognitive area when the perturbation is applied .     as a function of the chemical coupling strength @xmath24 for @xmath58 and the different controls applied on ( a ) the visual ,",
    "( b ) the auditory , and ( c ) the somatosensory - motor areas.,width=264,height=340 ]    in figure [ fig4 ] , the suppression factor is calculated for the controls applied on ( a ) the visual , ( b ) the auditory , and ( c ) the somatosensory - motor regions varying the chemical coupling strength .",
    "the feedback is represented by orange and red lines for @xmath69 equal to @xmath75 and @xmath76 iterations , respectively .",
    "the external time - periodic driving is denoted by green line , whereas the activation of selected neurons is represented by blue line .",
    "our results show that the feedback control with @xmath69 equal to @xmath76 does not produce a suppression of the synchronisation .",
    "conversely , for @xmath77 , for activation , and for time - periodic driving it is possible to observe a suppression with @xmath78 for a chemical coupling strength smaller than @xmath79 .",
    "the activation and the time - periodic driving have approximately the same behaviour of the suppression factor .",
    "we also verify that the feedback with @xmath77 presents the largest value of suppression factor .",
    "in addition , the other cognitive areas do not suffer a significant effect from these controlled areas ( visual , auditory , and somatosensory - motor ) , in other words , the unperturbed areas remain in a synchronised state .",
    ".,width=321,height=321 ]    in the same way that the controls are applied on the visual , the auditory , and the somatosensory - motor , we apply on the frontolimbic area . unlike the before cases , the uncontrolled cognitive areas presents a small influence from the suppression in the frontolimbic area .",
    "the suppression factor has its maximum value approximately equal to @xmath80 in a small range of the chemical coupling strength , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] for the visual , auditory , and somatosensory - motor areas . in the frontolimbic area ,",
    "the values of the suppression factor have a behaviour similar to that obtained in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "in fact , the feedback with @xmath69 equal to @xmath75 presents the best efficiency compared with the activation , the time - periodic driving , and with @xmath69 equal to @xmath76 .     versus the time delay @xmath69 , where we consider @xmath58 and @xmath81 . delayed feedback control applied on ( a ) the visual , ( b ) the auditory , ( c ) the somatosensory - motor , and ( d ) the frontolimbic areas.,width=321,height=321 ]    in view of our results from the delayed feedback control better than the activation and time - periodic driving , we analyse how the suppression factor is affected by the time delay @xmath69 and the percentage of perturbed neurons @xmath82 . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we can see the suppression factor in the bar for the number of perturbed neurons versus the time delay , where the delayed feedback is applied on ( a ) the visual , ( b ) the auditory , ( c ) the somatosensory - motor , and ( d ) the frontolimbic areas .",
    "the black regions correspond to the case in which the cognitive area does not present a suppression of synchronisation ( @xmath83 ) , the grey regions exhibit a small suppression of synchronisation with the suppression factor in the interval @xmath84 , and the white regions show the values of @xmath82 and @xmath69 where the feedback delayed control is more efficient ( @xmath85 ) . as a result",
    ", we verify that the method by means of feedback delayed control is efficient not only for different @xmath82 values , but also for small time delay .",
    "the time evolution of the mean field for the black region in figure [ fig6 ] presents a large amplitude oscillations , as a result of the synchronised behaviour .",
    "whereas , in the white region , where there is no evidence of synchronisation , the mean field has small amplitude oscillations .",
    "oscillation quenching has been investigated in systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators @xcite , that are classified in : oscillation ( od ) and amplitude death ( ad ) . in our simulations , we have verified that the 3 methods of suppression can induce to a mean field amplitude death ( mfad ) .",
    "this way , @xmath67 can be used as a disgnostic tool of mfad .",
    "in this work , we studied suppression of burst phase synchronisation in a neuronal network with a structure according to the corticocortical connections of the cat brain .",
    "we have considered the cat matrix , where each cortical area has a sub - network with small - world properties .",
    "considering an initial configuration in that the neuronal network presents a synchronous behaviour , we have applied and compared three different suppression methods : delayed feedback control , external time - periodic driving , and activation of neurons . as a result , we verify that it is possible to obtain suppression by means of the three methods .",
    "the methods produce suppression only in the cortical areas where are applied , except when they are applied on the frontolimbic area .",
    "we observe a small suppression in the other areas when the perturbations are applied on the frontolimbic area .",
    "this occurs due to the fact that the frontolimbic area presents a larger external connectivity than the other areas .    in our simulations , using the suppression factor as diagnostic tool , the delayed feedback control have shown the best efficiency compared with the external time - periodic driving and the activation of neurons .",
    "in addition , we have verified that the delayed feedback is better for small values of the time - delayed in a large range of the number of controlled neurons .",
    "the delayed feedback control does not damage the neurons due to the fact that it uses a signal amplitude presented by neuronal activity .",
