    "in four dimensions , a large family of solutions of vacuum einstein equations with the cosmological constant of type d have been constructed by plebaski and demiaski @xcite , generalizing the carter ",
    "plebaski form @xcite of non - accelerating solutions .",
    "various known metrics , for example the kerr metric @xcite , the taub - nut solution @xcite , or the ( accelerating ) c - metric e.g. @xcite are contained in this family as ` special cases ' .",
    "however , to obtain such special cases explicitly is not an easy task , as one has to perform certain ( often singular ) limits , scaling both the coordinates and the metric parameters .",
    "it is also for this reason the physical meaning of parameters of the plebaski ",
    "demiaski solution , describing for example the rotation or a nut charge , is often obscure and difficult to interpret , see e.g. @xcite . on the other hand , the carter ",
    "plebaski frame is directly linked to the underlying explicit and hidden symmetries of the geometry and hence is invaluable for the study of mathematical properties of the spacetime .",
    "for example , it is in this frame the test scalar field equations do separate @xcite .",
    "moreover , being able to describe a large family of spacetimes , the carter ",
    "plebaski ( or more generally plebaski  demiaski ) metric allows one to generate ( by taking special limits ) new types of solutions , see , e.g. , @xcite for recent examples .    although a generalization of the plebaski ",
    "demiaski family to higher dimensions remains elusive ( see however @xcite ) , a higher - dimensional generalization of the carter ",
    "plebaski class , the so - called _ kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetime _ , has been found by chen , l , and pope @xcite . the geometry describes _ a large family of metrics _ of various signatures that solve the einstein equations with the cosmological constant and contain a set of free parameters that can be related to mass , rotations , and nut parameters . in particular , the general rotating black holes of myers and perry @xcite , their cosmological constant generalizations due to gibbons et al .",
    "@xcite , or the higher - dimensional taub - nut spaces e.g. @xcite , are expected to emerge as certain limits of kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetimes .",
    "surprisingly , apart from its ` integrability properties ' not much is known about the kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry and its special subcases .",
    "on one hand , it has been shown @xcite that , similar to the four - dimensional carter ",
    "plebaski case , the kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetime represents a unique einstein space that admits a completely non - degenerate _ closed conformal killing ",
    "( ccky ) 2-form @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this tensor uniquely determines _",
    "canonical coordinates _ in which the metric is written . in these coordinates the hamilton ",
    "jacobi , klein ",
    "gordon , and dirac equations fully separate @xcite  making in particular the geodesic motion completely integrable @xcite .",
    "such integrability properties can be further linked to the existence of a full _ killing tower _ of explicit and hidden symmetries that can be generated from @xmath0 , see e.g. @xcite for a review . on the other hand ,",
    "again similar to the carter ",
    "plebaski case , it is not straightforward to precisely identify the exact physical meaning of the metric parameters , nor is particularly simple to obtain special subcases contained in the kerr - nut-(a)ds family .",
    "for example , the non - rotating schwarzschild  tangherlini black hole @xcite can not be simply recovered by merely setting some of the parameters equal to zero .",
    "the goal of this paper is to proceed towards better understanding of the higher - dimensional kerr - nut-(a)ds family @xcite as well as to uncover some of its special subcases .",
    "we start by performing a basic analysis of the kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetime , discussing its signature , coordinate ranges , scaling properties , and number of independent metric parameters . in particular , we identify the maximally symmetric space , the euclidean instanton , and the black hole solution . concentrating on the black hole case , we then show how to switch off some of the rotation parameters  constructing so a new rich class of vacuum ( with a possible cosmological constant ) black holes that can be distinguished not only by mass and rotation parameters but also by nut charges .    more concretely , we want to study black hole spacetimes that are generated from the kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry in the limit where some of the rotation parameters vanish .",
    "unfortunately , one can not just substitute zero values of the chosen rotational parameters directly in the kerr - nut-(a)ds metric , since the ranges of some coordinates would degenerate .",
    "this is related to a well known ambiguity in constructing the limiting spaces when some of the parameters limit to zero @xcite : there is always a possibility to make a coordinate transformation depending on the chosen parameters , before taking the limit . to escape the pathology and to achieve the limit of vanishing rotations",
    ", we have to properly _ rescale both _ the _ metric parameters _ and the _ coordinates_.    as we will demonstrate , the resulting black hole spacetimes have one parameter less than their kerr - nut-(a)ds precursor and inherit from it nice geometrical properties . in the absence of nuts , they reduce to the kerr-(a)ds black holes @xcite with several rotations switched off , in particular we obtain the schwarzschild  tangherlini-(a)ds solution @xcite . however , when the nut parameters are maintained , the black hole spacetimes are more interesting and , we believe , new .",
    "the metric acquires a warp product structure , where both components of the product have the form similar to the kerr - nut-(a)ds metric .",
    "namely , it takes the following form : = + ^2 , where the euclidean _ seed metric _ of the product , @xmath1 , is exactly the lower dimensional kerr - nut-(a)ds metric while the lorentzian _ base metric _",
    "@xmath2 has the same form but modified radial dependence . in general ,",
    "nut parameters remain in both components .",
    "we use this as an opportunity to partially rehabilitate a ` bad reputation ' of nut parameters which is based on the fact that in four dimensions they typically lead to causally ill - behaved spacetimes @xcite , see however recent discussion in @xcite .",
    "similar pathology happens in higher dimensions when the nut charges maintain their ` lorentzian character ' .",
    "however , when present only in the spatial part of the metric , the ` euclidean nut ' parameters just label deformations of the angular part of the metric and do not introduce regions with closed time - like curves .",
    "such nuts typically ` smoothen ' the curvature singularity , although the ` axes of rotation ' may suffer from non - regularity .",
    "this is precisely what happens with the surviving nut parameters after we take our limit .",
    "those surviving in the base part of the metric maintain their lorentzian character and lead to standard pathologies .",
    "those surviving in the seed part of the metric , which is euclidean , play different geometric role : they do not lead to pathologies with closed time - like curves and tend to smoothen the curvature singularity .",
    "such nuts control deformation and also a _ global twist _ of the euclidean geometry .",
    "namely , in higher dimensions we have a freedom in making linear combinations and various periodic identifications of killing coordinates , which we refer to as global twisting of the geometry . since the metric contains non - diagonal terms , the freedom in twisting can not be easily resolved .",
    "the presence of nut parameters additionally causes non - regularity on the axes of rotation and thus enters non - trivially into the discussion of twisting .    obviously , the twist is non - trivial only in the case when the seed metric is sufficiently ` multi - dimensional ' , that is , when it possesses more than one azimuthal killing coordinate .",
    "since the number of killing coordinates of the resulting seed metric equals ( in the studied even - dimensional case ) the number of rotation parameters that were _ simultaneously _ set equal to zero , to have a non - trivial twist two or more rotations have to be switched off simultaneously .",
    "we call the corresponding limit a _ multiple - spin - zero limit_. such a limit leads to the _ deformed and twisted _ black holes . on the other hand , when the rotation parameters are switched off _ successively _ one by one , that is when we apply several _ single - spin - zero limits _ , the resulting seed metrics are two dimensional and their twist vanishes . in particular , we shall consider a case where all rotations and twists are eventually switched off",
    ". we call the corresponding solutions the _ deformed _ ( non - twisted ) black holes . although they are static , their geometry is still non - trivially deformed by the presence of nut charges . as we shall show in sec .",
    "[ sc : multilimit ] , the same geometry can be obtained by a successive application of the multiple - spin - zero limit , each of which leaves the base metric only two dimensional .    after obtaining the limiting metrics",
    "we discuss their symmetries .",
    "in particular , we show that the resulting warped geometry admits a _ degenerate _ ccky 2-form @xmath3 , inherited from the base metric @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting geometry therefore belongs to a wide class of _ generalized kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetimes _ constructed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite , see app .",
    "a for their review . despite the degeneracy of this tensor",
    ", we show that the new geometry inherits the full original symmetry structure of the kerr - nut-(a)ds family , namely , it possesses the full killing tower of hidden and explicit symmetries that can be obtained through the scaling limits of the original killing tower of symmetries .",
    "( these symmetries can be also built up by a proper combination of the killing towers of both seed and base geometries , see @xcite . ) for this reason our new metrics represent a very special sub - class of generalized kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetimes , characterized by a property that they maintain the full killing tower .",
    "in particular , this implies that the new class of solutions inherits the integrability properties of the original kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry .",
    "as expected , for vanishing nut , twist , and deformation parameters , the symmetry is further enlarged .",
    "for example , the schwarzschild ",
    "tangherlini-(a)ds solution is spherically - symmetric and its group of isometries is larger than the symmetry group of the initial metric .",
    "similar `` symmetry enlargement '' also happens , when one puts some smaller set of the rotation and nut parameters equal to zero .",

    "we introduce the kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry and analyze its basic properties . in sec .  [",

    "we will use this freedom in the lorentzian case , requiring gauge condition below .",

    "moreover , no new independent integrals of motion are in general present in the obtained space .",

    "this tensor becomes degenerate , @xmath401 . as a result",
    ", the metric belongs to a wider class of metrics called the generalized kerr - nut-(a)ds spacetimes ( see app .  a ) .",
    "such metrics do not necessarily admit the full killing tower of symmetries .",
    "however , our limiting procedure was constructed in such a way , that the adopted ` enhancement ' of the vanishing part of the ccky tensor results in appearance of a new additional two - form @xmath198 . this object ` takes care ' of the additional integrals of motion , which ` disappeared ' because of the degeneracy of the surviving ccky tensor @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the full killing tower of symmetries still exists , though it can not be generated from a single non - degenerate ccky tensor .",

    "the presence of euclidean nuts is less severe than that of their lorentzian counterparts ; typically euclidean nut charges smoothen the curvature singularity and introduce a global twisting of the geometry ( the axes of symmetry may suffer from non - regularity due to identifications of killing angles ) .",

    "a few interesting possible developments immediately come to mind .",
    "the most obvious one is the extension of the present results to odd dimensions .",
    "next is to consider another interesting limit where some of the rotation parameters are set equal but non - zero .",

    ". one might be even able to obtain the recently constructed super - entropic black holes @xcite .",
    "although we studied the limit under which the nut parameters survive and characterize a deformation of the resulting geometry , our limiting procedure is significantly different from the four - dimensional limit in which the carter  plebaski generic metric is turned to the taub  nut solution , see , e.g. , @xcite . in our limit",
    ", the metric functions @xmath12 are approximately given by the even polynomials @xmath402 with roots @xmath403 , and these roots get only slightly modified by the linear nut term . by sending @xmath404 we send some of these roots to zero . as a result",
    "the spacetime assumes a warp structure with `` minimal coupling '' between the regular and unspinned sectors . on other hand , the taub ",
    "nut limit corresponds to the case when the even polynomial @xmath402 does not have maximal number of real roots and the real roots appear only due to the nut term .",
    "nut solution is then obtained when two of these roots coincide .",
    "a detailed discussion of such a limit in higher dimensions awaits to be properly studied .",
    "another future direction would be to generalize the above limit to solutions with non - trivial matter fields .",
    "in particular , one may consider a test electromagnetic field @xcite and its impact on integrability of charged geodesic motion .",
    "surprisingly , not much is still known about the higher - dimensional kerr - nut-(a)ds geometry .",
    "being a higher - dimensional generalization of the carter ",
    "plebaski class it likely contains a large family of solutions of einstein s equations of various signatures and physical interpretations . in the present paper we have slightly uncovered the basic structure of this family .",
    "in particular , by studying the signature and ranges of coordinates we identified black hole solutions of the kerr-(a)ds type . we also were able to find one special subclass contained in this family that arises from switching off one of the ` rotation parameters '",

    "probably the most difficult is to analyze the meaning of free parameters that appear in the kerr - nut-(a)ds solution .",
    "analogous task has been accomplished for the carter ",
    "plebaski class only recently @xcite .",
    "the process of identification of these parameters is intrinsically related to a procedure by which various special limits can be taken and various subclasses identified .",
    "the metrics of the generalized kerr - nut-(a)ds type are likely to emerge in this process , smearing the gap between the two families .",
