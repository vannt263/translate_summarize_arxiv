    "monomethine cyanines have a distinguished role in the history of chemical science and industry.@xcite the description of their optical properties was an early target of quantum electronic structure models.@xcite the optical properties of monomethine dyes and push - pull polyenes can be described by two - diabatic - state models based on the concept of resonance between configurations with opposing charge and bond localization.@xcite .",
    "the resonating diabatic states are shown for four typical symmetric monomethine dyes in [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "a distinguishing feature of monomethine cyanines is the environmental sensitivity of their fluorescence emission yield.@xcite the dyes are practically non - fluorescent in fluid solutions , but can become highly fluorescent when bound to biomolecules or other constraining media.@xcite this underlies the use of monomethine cyanines as fluorescent turn - on labels in biological imaging . the fluorescence enhancement is interpreted as suppression of a bond - twisting process in the excited state , which would otherwise lead to dark twisted intramolecular ( tict ) states@xcite .",
    "the tict states in monomethine cyanines are dark , so population of these states is associated with ultrafast loss of transient fluorescence .",
    "the tict are characterized by a small adiabatic gap , and nonadiabatic decay can occur by conical intersections that occur at twisted geometries.@xcite    enhancement of fluorescence due to suppression of excited - state twisting motion is the defining characteristic of a `` molecular rotor''@xcite .",
    "this behavior is not limited to monomethine cyanines .",
    "an example of a non - methine molecular rotor is the amyloid fibril - sensing dye thioflavin - t@xcite .",
    "this molecule undergoes twisting in the excited state , allowing ultrafast internal conversion via twisted intramolecular charge - transfer ( tict ) states with small or vanishing electronic gap@xcite .",
    "the tict states in thioflavin - t and auramine - o are dark , so that the twisting reaction is accompanied by a fast transient fluorescence decay and negligible steady - state quantum yield .",
    "the fluorescence is enhanced upon binding to biomolecular environments or in viscous solution .",
    "the nonradiative decay rates of thioflavin - t and the monomethine dye auramine - o have been extensively characterized by huppert and coworkers in a series of glass - forming alcohols , under conditions spanning 10 orders of magnitude in the viscosity@xcite .",
    "these studies supported earlier indications@xcite that the nonradiative decay time could be estimated from the damped rotational stokes drift of a spherical rotor down a linear potential through an angle of one radian .",
    "the reaction coordinate is taken to be rotation of a double bond to form a dark tict state .",
    "a useful estimate of the rotational timescale ( which describes the non - radiative decay timsecale ) was found to be @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the medium viscosity , @xmath9 is the effective volume of the rotor ( 20 @xmath10 were taken for thioflavin - t or auramine - o ) , and @xmath11 is the mean torque on the rotor over a rotation of one radian .",
    "a key point was that the non - radiative decay timescale was found to depend linearly on the medium viscosity .",
    "a linear viscosity dependence of the nonradiative decay rate was also observed in experiments on the triphenylmethane dye crystal violet , which decays via a similar mechanism.@xcite    different possible situations for a one - dimensional molecular rotor system with dark tict states are illustrated schematically in figure [ fig : tictoutcomes ] . for twisting that is both favorable in the excited state and without barrier",
    ", one expects ultrfast (  1ps ) decay of fluorescence as the tict state is formed from the bright franck - condon ( fc ) state . provided depletion of tict excited state is not rate - limiting , which our results support ( see below ) , ground state recovery should track the fluorescence decay . for twisting that is favorable but activated ,",
    "one expects slower fluorescence decay . again ,",
    "if the depletion of the excited tict states is not rate - limiting , the ground state recovery should follow the fluorescence decay . when tict state formation is not favorable , we expect that they do not form on a relevant timescale and the molecule is fluorescent . if our assumption about fast depletion of the tict excited - state were wrong , so that populuation accumulates on the excited state , then the same pattern would appear in the ultrafast fluorescence , but we would expect the ground state recovery to lengthen independently .    for molecular rotors with the dimensions characteristic of monomethine cyanines , the timescale for generation of a charge - transfer state by twisting and the timescale for solvation of the same charge - transfer state can not be reliably separated .",
    "the nonradiative decay times for thioflavin - t and auramine - o in glass - forming solvents scale with the transverse debye dielectric relaxation time@xcite , but are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with nonradiative decay times that are comparable to the debye _ longitudinal _ relaxation time .",
    "the longitudinal relaxation time is the appropriate timescale to describe dielectric relaxation following a sudden change in the molecular charge density@xcite . for alcoholic solutions ,",
    "the longitudinal relaxation time will be  10 times smaller than the transverse timescale@xcite , which is comparable to estimated twisting times .",
    "although solvent - dependent effects can be observed at sub - ps timescales for auramine - o , these were assigned to a distinct dynamical origin.@xcite heisler and colleagues showed for auramine - o in nanoconfined water droplets that restriction of solvation by the confinement slowed the fluorescence upconversion decay.@xcite results reported by kondo and coworkers for auramine - o in bulk solutions indicated that the dominance of solvation dynamics vs reaction coordinate friction in determining the fluorescence upconversion decay could not be determined for several solvents excepting water , for which solvation dynamics was dominant.@xcite the _ n , n_-dimethylaniline rotors in auramine - o are identical to those of michler s hydrol blue in figure [ fig : scheme ] , and so the timescales for damped twisting are expected also to be the same .",
    "if the timescales for solvation and for twisting are comparable , then a faithful description of the physics must treat these processes at a comparable level of approximation . a successful yet simple approach for the one - dimensional rotor _",
    "n , n_-dimethylbenzoaminonitrile ( dmabn ) , which forms an emissive tict state on a timescale much longer than common for monomethine cyanines , has been to develop two - dimensional models coupled to a twisting coordinate and a single solvation coordinate that gauges the polarization state of the medium.@xcite    the identification of monomethine cyanines as molecular rotors raises an interesting question , because the ground states of these molecules are a superposition of structures with different @xmath12-bond localization ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : scheme ] ) . in a molecule where the double bond can be in multiple places , how does one choose the appropriate reaction coordinate to describe double bond twisting in the excited state ?",
    "ab initio studies of the excited state surface in monomethine cyanines indicate that there are not one but _ two _ low - energy twisting channels on the excited - state potential energy surface@xcite .",
    "general models of tict electronic structure suggest that as the bond twisting proceeds , the lowest two adiabatic states should become polarized and form a twisted intramolecular charge - transfer ( tict ) system.@xcite .",
    "this picture is upheld by more detailed quantum chemical models@xcite . however , twisting one or the other bond will destabilize the diabatic states by different amounts  because the @xmath12-bonds are in different places .",
    "accordingly , the polarity of the tict adiabatic states will depend upon the bond that is twisted@xcite .",
    "the dependence of the tict polarity on the identity of the twisted bond can also be explained using simple molecular orbital theories.@xcite the correlation between the path taken and the tict polarity suggests that a polar environment can distinguish the twisting pathways , and could influence their relative yields .",
    "this has been suggested as the mechanism that underlies reversible photochromism and fluorescence switching in fluorescent proteins@xcite .",
    "fluctuation in the charge - coordination environment have been predicted to influence the bifurcation and availability of twisting pathways in photoactive yellow protein chromophores@xcite .",
    "modern theoretical photochemistry suggests the location , topography and energetics of conical intersection seams between adiabatic electronic states are important for understanding the mechanism and yield of photochemical reactions@xcite .",
    "ab initio calculations and general models indicate that conical intersections can occur in monomethine dyes in configurations where one or more bonds is twisted , so that the @xmath12 orbitals on the fragments across the bond overlap weakly@xcite .",
    "the non - adiabatic coupling ( to nuclear displacement ) diverges at conical intersections , so that internal conversion is expected to be dominated by configurations near these points . unlike transition states that separate different basins on a given surface , conical intersections are multidimensional seams embedded in the configuration space of the molecule@xcite .",
    "although conical intersections can sometimes be discussed in terms of their minimum - energy configurations , there are cases where the relevant nonadiabatic dynamics is thought to occur far removed from the minimum - energy regions of the intersection seam@xcite .",
    "since the twisted conical intersections in monomethine dyes arise from intersection of diabatic states with different charge localization , changes in the solvent configuration could very plausibly affect the positioning , topology and/or energetics of the seam .",
    "the effect of polar solvation on the structure of conical intersection seams in a retinal protonated schiff base model has been studied in a series of papers by hynes and coworkers@xcite . in these papers , it was shown that solvent effects determined the placement and energy of conical intersection seams , as well as the coordinates that accessed them . a tendency for charge - transfer conical intersections to be stabilized by solvents excited - state potential in solvated systems has been observed in excited - state dynamics simulations@xcite .    in this paper , we seek to develop a better intuition for how non - equilibrium solvation affects the excited - state twisting process in monomethine cyanines , with special attention to the issue that there are two possible twisting pathways that can be distinguished by the solvent .",
    "one reason why it is important to consider simple models is that simple models make it easy to keep track of how the ideas that go into the model relate to the predictions that come out .",
    "that way , a challenge to the model can be framed as a challenge to the underlying ideas , rather than to some detail of the model parameterization . in this paper , we focus on only a few ideas that are simple extensions of the old notion of cyanine electronic structure as a resonance between structures with opposing charge- and bond - order localization ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "our model describes favorable excited - state twisting with no or a small barrier for typical monomethine cyanines in solution , leading to a manifold of twisted intramolecular charge - transfer ( tict ) configurations with small or no electronic gap .",
    "the driving force for twisting in the isolated dye is small for dyes with absorption in the red , and increases with increasing absorption energy for a given @xmath12-bond stabilization energy .",
    "the model predicts that solvation of products along one twisting pathway tends to destabilize the alternate pathway , so that the model can describe solvent - driven selection of distinguishable tict channels .",
    "the position and energy of a conical intersection in the tict manifold is shown to change with the solvent configuration .",
    "the fraction of tict states that can be made to coincide with the intersection seam grows with the solvent reorganization energy . for couplings corresponding to typical monomethine cyanines in polar solvents",
    ", there is no minimum or `` basin '' that can be associated with an adiabatically excited tict system .",
    "instead , the bottom of the excited state potential coincides with a conical intersection for monomethine cyanines in even moderately polar solvents .    here",

    "@xmath13    the hamiltonian is comprised of two subcomponents , a dye hamiltonian @xmath14 , which is a function of the bridge - bond twist angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and a solvent interaction hamiltonian @xmath17 , which is a function of a single solvent configuration coordinate @xmath18 , which interpolates between equilibria with @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the electronic coupling strength , the @xmath12-bond stabilization energy , and the diabatic solvent reorganization energy .",

    "diagonal coupling has one term representing charge transfer between rings via sequential transfers across both bridge bonds .",
    "the direct transfer element between the ring is taken to be neglible , so that the lowest order couplings between the ( many - body ) diabatic states go as the product of transfer terms for each bond , and the modulation of transfer across each bond goes as the overlap between @xmath12-orbitals on the bonding fragments .",

    "in the latter case , the molecule will remain on the excited state in a region of strong radiative coupling and would be expected to decay by fluorescence . if the energy at * rt*/*lt * vanishes , then there is no driving force for twisting . in the case of a flat , barrierless surface , equation",

    "the question of whether or not there is a barrier to twisting boils down to the sign of the eigenvalues of the second - derivative matrix ( hessian ) with respect to the twisting displacements at * fc*. the solvent coordinate is always bound in the adiabatic excited - state of our model ( as can be verified by consideration of figure [ fig : nitzan ] and remembering that @xmath81 ) .",
    "the hessian is diagonal at * fc * , and the force constants associated with the two twisting displacements are equal by symmetry .",
    "the excited - state force constants with respect to these displacements have the particularly simple form    @xmath82    .",

    "we expect the presence of the barrier to lengthen the fluorescence decay . however , the time to internal conversion on the far side of the barrier should be independent of the barrier height , so that in the activated regime we expect other contributions to the ground - state recovery time to be unaffected . the ground - state recovery time",
    "would be expected to be dominated by the fluorescence decay time in this case .",

    "assuming an attempt frequency of @xmath97 for a torsional barrier , this would not be sufficient to engender steady - state fluorescence in the dye for moderately polar solvents @xmath98 .",
    "the observation of a barrier to twisting in our model must be approached with awareness that we are leaving out potentially important intramolecular degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , our model does not consider bond vibration displacements , to which the states in these systems are known to be coupled .",
    "laage and hynes have suggested a form for the diabatic coupling that is formally identical to the solvation model we use here.@xcite it has been pointed out that the coupling of solvation and stretching displacements through the same electronic degree of freedom ( the diabatic gap ) , can amplify the effects of either.@xcite if a solvation coordinate were included in this way , with a reorganization energy of order @xmath99 , it would act to reduce the barrier height and increase the driving force for reaction .",
    "this may lower the barrier to the point that it becomes irrelevant for typical monomethine cyanines .",
    "we conclude that our model predicts barrierless or near - barrierless excited state twisting for typical solvated monomethine cyanines , but we are unable to rule out the possibility that a monomethine cyanine may exist , if the dye has near - ir absorbance and large @xmath12-bonding interactions , that would show steady - state fluorescence in sufficiently non - polar solvents .",

    "it has been suggested that the timescales observed in ultrafast spectroscopic experiments on monomethine cyanines may be interpreted on the basis of a partitioning of the dynamics between ( fast ) descent into a basin corresponding to a twisted configuration , followed by diffusion to the sink or conical intersection.@xcite this notion presupposes the existence of an adiabatic twisted minimum on the excited state surface , in which diffusion could occur . in this section ,",
    "we address the question of whether a true ( i.e. gapped ) excited state minimum can exist in the tict manifold .    to answer the question , we analyze the extent and location of conical intersections in the model .",
    "the conditions for intersection of adiabatic states is that the diabatic gap and coupling vanish simultaneously .",
    "this gives    @xmath100    for the coupling , and @xmath101 for the gap .",

    "again , we have concentrated solely on the `` patch '' shown in figure [ fig : atlas ] ; a more general statement would include periodic images of the ci .",
    "it is clear that [ eq : ci_conditions2 ] can only be solved for @xmath105 if @xmath106 , since the range of @xmath18 is limited to the interval @xmath107 $ ] . for solvent configurations @xmath108 ,",

    "accordingly , there is an adiabatic gap remaining at angles @xmath111 less than some minimum angle @xmath112 for which the ci may exist .",
    "if tict states exist that are gapped for all solvent configurations , then these may accumulate population on the excited state surface , which will decay following diffusion to the vicinity of the ci seam .",
    "if the adiabatic excited state pes does possess a minimum , and if this basin is sufficiently removed in energy and configuration space from the intersection seam such that transient steady - state population accumulates there , we would expect the ground state recovery time to increase without consummate lengthening of the fluroescence decay time . this is because the tict states are dark , so accumulated population in the tict channels will not contribute to the fluorescence .",
    "table [ tab : solv_reorg_en ] says that , for a dye with dimensions similar to michler s hydrol blue ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) , the reorganization energy should be of order 1 ev even for weakly polar solvents .",

    "however , even for an angular interval of @xmath116 radian , we expect that the diffusion time in a medium of viscosity @xmath117 cp might be @xmath118 , and so this should be detectable as a delay in the ground state recovery time that is not apparent in the fluorescence decay time .    for dye - solvent systems with @xmath119",
    ", the ci can be brought into coincidence with any point in the tict channels . since the tict channels represent the bottom of the excited - state potential ( c.f .",
    "discussion relevant to blue line in figure [ fig : phase_diagram ] , above ) , this implies that a ci spans the bottom of the excited state potential of the model in this regime .",
    "this regime is the one that we expect to be relevant to most spectroscopic experiments using monomethine cyanines in moderate- to strongly polar solvents ( such as eg .",
    "small - chain alcohols )",
    ".    the growth of access to the tict channels by the ci can be dramatically visualized by taking the fast - solvent limit , where the solvent is allowed to equilibrate to the dye at every fixed dye configuration .",
    "this limit yields two - dimensional potential energy surface such as shown in figure [ fig : zippingupci ] for michler s hydrol blue . in the fast - solvent limit ,",
    "the coincidence of the ci with the bottom of the excited - state pes is apparent as a `` zipping up '' of the tict states as the seam extends into the channels . the results shown in figure [ fig : zippingupci ] show that even for weakly polar solvents , the intersection can already extends over most of the tict configurations .",
    "the pes given for acetonitrile in the figure is the same for _ all _ solvents with @xmath120 .",
    "this is because solvent configurations that are sufficiently polarized to re - introduce an excited - state gap also raise the excited - state energy , so that the force on the solvent coordinate at these configurations will drive the system back towards the intersection .",
    "accordingly , these solvent configurations are never sampled in the fast - solvent limit .",
    "the phenomenon of `` zipping up '' of intersection seams in the fast - solvent limit has also been described by burgardt and co - workers for a model of the photoisomerization of a protonated schiff base@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be traced in both cases to the diagonal form of the solvation coupling used in the hamiltonian equation [ eq : ham_mat ] .",
    "erez et al .",
    "have showed for the molecular rotors thioflavin - t and auramine - o , that the nonradiative decay timescale is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude slower than the transverse dielectric relaxation timescale in a variety of glass - forming solvents@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a twisting timescale that is of the same order as the _ longitudinal _ debye relaxation time .",
    "the longitudinal time will an order of magnitude lower than the transverse time in lower alcohols .",
    "the longitudinal relaxation time is the relevant time for solvation following a change in the charge distribution@xcite .",
    "these points emphasize that only qualitative insights can be obtained from considering the fast - solvent limit , which is not believably achieved in real experiments on symmetric monomethines .",
    "we have proposed a valence - bond model of non - equilibrium solvation effects on the excited - state twisting reaction of a general monomethine cyanine dye .",
    "the model has been made intentionally simple , so as to explore the consequences of a few specific ideas .",
    "the solvation model is similar to a previously published model of anomalous solvatochromism charged push - pull polyenes@xcite .",
    "it differs by the introduction of potentials for twisting distinct @xmath12-bonds in the diabatic states , and the introduction of a twist - dependent coupling that goes as product of @xmath12 orbital overlaps across the bridge .",
    "the functional forms used can be justified using valence - bond models@xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the concept resonance in dyes , traditionally used to describe optical properties@xcite@xcite , may also explain non - radiative decay . since the resonance notation of figure [ fig : scheme ] describes a transfer between states with different charge- and bond - order localization , the location of the barrier is different in the diabatic states .",
    "the correlation of charge and @xmath12-bond order localization has important consequences for the structure of the excited state pes in the model , and the response to non - equilibrium solvation .",
    "the assumption of a coupling that varies as a product of overlaps across the bridge bonds is a consequence of the negligibility of the direct ( single particle ) inter - ring charge - transfer matrix element , which is traditionally assumed.@xcite    the model broadly reproduces features of the ground and excited state pes that are observed in more complicated electronic structure calculations of monomethine cyanines@xcite@xcite and related systems@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that there are two energetically accessible twisting channels on the excited state surface , and that these channels are distinguished by the polarity of the adiabatic tict transitions within the channels@xcite@xcite , such that control of the pathway yield by environmental interactions is possible@xcite@xcite@xcite .    for parameter regions characteristic of monomethine dyes ( c.f .",

    "the intersection occurs at a geometry of the dye where both bonds are twisted .",
    "this is an ambiguous position with respect to the two tict channels .",
    "it corresponds to either a concerted- or `` hula- '' twisted geometry@xcite . as the solvent configuration changes , so as to solvate better one or the other diabatic state , the intersection moves into one of the tict channels",
    "this means that the intersection will occur at a geometry where one bond is twisted more than the other .    in general , _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on methine dyes show that minimal - energy conical intersections in symmetric monomethine cyanines occur at geometries where both bonds are twisted , but where the twist distribution is not symmetric@xcite .",
    "this is also true in non - symmetric methines with very small diabatic gap@xcite .",
    "the reason why our model predicts a symmetric twist distribution can be traced to the neglect of other intramolecular displacements that could break symmetry in the any real specific case . in any case",
    ", our results suggest that intersections in methines can move in response to solvation , and will move to the bottom of the excited - state pes for solvents of moderate polarity .",
    "decay via different twisting channels is favoured for distinct configurations of the solvent .",
    "migration of conical intersections towards the bottom of the excited state potential in solvated organics was observed in early qm / mm wavepacket simulations of solvated photoisomerization in methines@xcite .",
    "our model gives a simple and transparent description of this effect for the case of monomethine cyanines .",
    "our model predicts that configurations with mixed twist distributions ( for example , the `` hula - twist '' configuration * ht * ) have relatively low energy on the excited - state pes .",
    "in particular , these geometries are accessible from * fc * in gas phase .",
    "this is contraindicated by _",
    "ab initio _",
    "calculations on monomethine cyanines@xcite , as well as non - symmetric monomethines with small diabatic gap@xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the discrepancy is that , in our model , there is no additional penalty for breaking both @xmath12 bonds at once .",
    "this could be added to our model easily , but would not qualitatively alter our main results .",
    "we have provided a simple expression for the lowest energy possible in the tict channels , relative to * fc * , that can occur in our model .",

    "these estimates are in reasonable agreement with measured values of @xmath132 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively.@xcite    equations [ eq : qyield ] , [ eq : trot2 ] and [ eq : e1min ] together suggest that the fluorescence quantum yield of a monomethine cyanine is limited by the relative value of the driving torque in the excited state and the hydrodynamic friction . for a given dye chromophore ( i.e. given @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) ,",
    "the driving torque will be modulated by the reorganization energy as equation [ eq : e1min ] , so that decreasing the reorganization energy of the environment of the dye will , in the absence of other considerations , give greater fluorescence , as will increasing the viscosity .",
    "alternatively , for a given medium , the driving force will be increased by reducing the electronic coupling or by increasing the hydrodynamic volume .    assuming a @xmath12-bond stabilization energy of @xmath126 ev , as we have here , implies that only monomethines with near - ir absorbance will have inaccessible tict states .",
    "polar solvation can only accelerate tict formation ( in one channel or another ) . in a structured environment , such as provided by a protein ,",
    "it is possible that the elastic properties of the protein may provide an additional potential barrier , but there seems little scope for engendering fluorescence in fluid solution by the manipulation of the driving torque .    on the other hand , if the rotation timescale is linear in the viscosity as suggested by equation [ eq : trot ] , and given that the timescale for diffusion on a flat potential of @xmath137 ps for e.g. michler s hydrol blue , one expects that a 1000-fold increase in the viscosity should be sufficient to achieve significant fluorescence .",
    "this is consistent with changes in the fluorescence of michler s hydrol blue recorded in a series of water - glycerol mixtures sampling this viscosity range.@xcite it is also broadly consistent with the radiative lifetime of auramine - o and thioflavin - t over a broader range.@xcite    both the driving torque and the hydrodynamic friction depend on the spatial extent of the endgroups .",
    "the driving torque varies inversely with @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "equation [ eq : reorg_e ] ) , while the hydrodynamic friction scales with the volume ( i.e. with @xmath138 ) .",

    "specifically , a fast (  1ps ) component in the dynamics has been attributed to twisting motion towards an excited state basin , followed by depletion from the basin through the sink on the longer (  10ps ) timescale@xcite . for a dye such as 1122c , with rings about double that of michler s hydrol blue , the reorganization energy in alcohol solution may be sufficiently low as to allow the existence of gapped tict states , which could support adiabatic excited - state population diffusion . for a dye of this size in methanol",
    ", we have estimated the timescale for tict formation ( as above , but with @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) , and found it to be several picoseconds .",
    "however , the timescale for diffusion on a flat potential ( such as would be expected for population diffusing on the adiabatic excited state in a gapped region of the tict channels ) is several _ tens _ of ps .",
    "for dyes in moderately polar solution , for which the driving torque will be @xmath141 , the timescale for tict formation may be distinctly faster than the timescale for flat potential diffusion of an adiabatically excited tict population .",
    "this suggests that our model may describe the transient accumulation of adiabatically excited tict population for dyes with rings comparable to those in 1122c .",
    "further elaboration of this possibility would seem to require time - dependent simulations , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have proposed and analysed a valence - bond model of non - equilibrium solvation in a monomethine cyanine dye . the lowest adiabatic transition in these systems",
