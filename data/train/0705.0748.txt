    "the situation regarding the growing body of evidence that some globular clusters ( gcs ) may be harbouring intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) has been summarized recently by baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) .",
    "this evidence includes taking the relationship found between the masses of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) and the bulge masses of the host galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) and extrapolating to globular cluster masses ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . for a typical globular cluster , such as m15 ( van der marel 2001 )",
    ", this gives a bh mass of @xmath2 .",
    "sitting conveniently between the supermassive and stellar - mass bh regimes  where the latter includes bhs of @xmath3 or less  the imbh tag arises naturally .",
    "the existence of such bhs is backed up by the @xmath0-body simulations of portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showing that possible progenitors ( main - sequence stars of @xmath2 ) can be created through runaway mergers of massive stars in young clusters .",
    "detection is possible through the measurement of central velocity dispersions in globular clusters but this is a challenging process ( baumgardt , makino & hut 2005 ; trenti 2006 ) .",
    "to date this has led to suggestions of an imbh in the core of m15 ( gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ) and in the core of g1 ( gebhardt , rich & ho 2002 )",
    ". however , baumgardt et al . ( 2003a , 2003b ) subsequently used @xmath0-body simulations to show that the inferred non - luminous central mass could instead be a central concentration of stellar - mass bhs , white dwarfs and neutron stars ( but see also gebhardt , rich & ho 2005 ) .",
    "notwithstanding the lack of direct confirmation that imbhs do reside in the cores of gcs , study into the ramifications of such a scenario has progressed .",
    "importantly , baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) have shown that a gc with an imbh in the core will be observed to have a relatively flat central surface brightness profile and consequently a larger measured core - radius compared to a gc without an imbh .",
    "this result has been followed up by trenti ( 2006 ) who suggests that the ratio of the core radius , @xmath4 , to the half - mass radius , @xmath5 , of a dynamically - evolved cluster can be used to infer the presence of an imbh .",
    "trenti ( 2006 ) combines results from a variety of @xmath0-body simulations ( heggie , trenti & hut 2006 ; trenti , heggie & hut 2007 ; trenti et al .",
    "these show that @xmath6 for clusters composed initially of single stars only , @xmath7 for clusters with primordial binaries , and @xmath8 for clusters with an imbh .",
    "these values are taken when the model clusters are relaxed systems and the core - collapse phase has ended . in comparison ,",
    "observations of galactic gcs show a distribution of @xmath9 extending from @xmath10 with a peak at about 0.5 ( fregeau et al . 2003 ) . from a theoretical viewpoint heggie et al .",
    "( 2006 ) examine how the @xmath9 ratio varies with the bh mass .",
    "this also suggests that a star cluster observed to have a large core radius presents the most promising target for finding an imbh , in the sense that large mass implies large core radius . as with the above results",
    "this argument is only valid in the post - collapse regime .",
    "a recurring issue with @xmath0-body simulations of star cluster evolution is that the models are generally idealized in some way ( or ways ) that prohibits direct comparison to real clusters .",
    "the simulations of heggie , trenti & hut ( 2006 ) , trenti , heggie & hut ( 2007 ) and trenti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) were restricted to initial particle numbers of @xmath11 or less and assumed equal - mass stars . as pointed out by trenti ( 2006 )",
    "these results can be scaled to gc particle numbers ( @xmath12 ) but only by also neglecting stellar evolution .",
    "simulations performed by baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) and baumgardt , makino & ebisuzaki ( 2004 ) included particle numbers up to @xmath13 stars , a mass spectrum and stellar evolution .",
    "however , primordial binaries were not included .",
    "another key factor is that one must be sure to compare like - with - like when using model and real data .",
    "specifically this relates to use of the core radius , half - mass ( or half - light ) radius , and the half - mass relaxation timescale , @xmath14 .",
    "considering the growing interest in imbhs it is only natural that attempts are being made to isolate key observational tests for their existence .",
    "unfortunately , in this paper , it is shown that @xmath9 can not readily be used as such a test .",
    "this is based on a series of @xmath0-body models of @xmath1 stars with and without primordial binaries .",
    "the models include a full mass spectrum , stellar and binary evolution , and account for the tidal field of the galaxy .",
    "the models do not include imbhs .",
    "model data is analysed using a pipeline analogous to that used to reduce real cluster data .",
    "section  [ s : models ] gives a description of the models used in this work including the initial setup of the models and an overview of the evolution .",
    "a detailed look at the internal structure of the model clusters is then given in section  [ s : results ] along with a description of the attempt to analyse model data as real data .",
    "this is followed by a discussion in relation to previous work and observations of galactic gcs , and finally a summary of the main results .",
    "the focus of this work is a set of realistic @xmath0-body simulations that each starts with @xmath15 objects  an object being either a star or a binary .",
    "specifically , the starting models contain : @xmath1 single stars and no primordial binaries ( labelled the k100 - 00 simulation ) ; @xmath16 single stars and @xmath17 binaries ( k100 - 05 ) ; and , @xmath18 single stars and @xmath19 binaries ( k100 - 10 ) .",
    "masses for the stars are chosen from the initial mass function ( imf ) of kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) between the limits of @xmath20 .",
    "metallicity is set at @xmath21 for the stars .",
    "the initial positions and velocities are assigned according to a plummer density profile ( plummer 1911 ; aarseth , hnon & wielen 1974 ) in virial equilibrium .",
    "a scale length of @xmath22pc is set for each simulation  this is to comply with the tidal radius set by the external tidal field ( see below ) . in actual fact",
    "the results from two simulations starting with @xmath1 single stars will be utilised .",
    "these simulations are identical in all respects except for the random number seed used to generate the starting masses , positions and velocities .",
    "these will be known as k100 - 00a and k100 - 00b .",
    "see table  [ t : table1 ] for a list of the simulations used in this work .",
    "the model clusters are evolved using the nbody4 code ( aarseth 1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "this includes algorithms for stellar and binary evolution as described in hurley et al .",
    "simulations are performed using 32-chip grape-6 boards ( makino 2002 ) located at the american museum of natural history .",
    "each simulation took approximately six months to complete on a dedicated grape-6 board .    to account for the tidal field of the galaxy each cluster",
    "is placed on a circular orbit at a distance of @xmath22kpc from the galactic centre with an orbital speed of @xmath23 .",
    "this is commonly referred to as a standard galactic tide ( see giersz & heggie 1997 for a full description ) . for the model clusters in this work , which each have a starting mass of @xmath24 , this gives an initial tidal radius of about @xmath25pc . with the length - scale given above the clusters",
    "are close to filling their tidal radii at birth , noting that the position of the outermost star will vary from model to model as positions are drawn at random from a distribution .",
    "each cluster was evolved to a minimum age of @xmath26gyr .",
    "this ensured that the core - collapse phase of evolution was completed and that models of comparable age to gcs were available for analysis .",
    "in fact , for model k100 - 00b it is not necessarily true that core - collapse was reached . for reasons that will become evident in section  [ s : results ] this model did not show a deep minimum in core - radius prior to its termination at @xmath26gyr whereas the other three models did show such a minimum between @xmath27gyr . for interest sake",
    "the k100 - 05 simulation was allowed to proceed to @xmath28gyr .",
    "after @xmath26gyr of evolution the model clusters had been reduced to @xmath29 and , in terms of mass , approximately 80% of the cluster had been lost over that period .",
    "the tidal radius at @xmath26gyr was about @xmath30pc .",
    "the evolution of the k100 - 05 model is shown in figure  [ f : fig1 ] in terms of the number of half - mass relaxation times that have elapsed .",
    "this is done using both the initial half - mass relaxation timescale ( @xmath31myr ) and the timescale after @xmath32gyr ( @xmath33myr ) .",
    "the difference between the two is significant and shows that one must be very careful using the observationally determined @xmath14 of a cluster to infer the dynamical age ( this point will be returned to later ) .",
    "the relaxation time is calculated according to the standard expression developed by spitzer ( 1987 : see eq .  1 of baumgardt , makino & hut 2005 ) .",
    "in reality @xmath14 is an evolving quantity , generally decreasing with age , and this must be accounted for when calculating the true dynamical age ( see the solid - line in figure  [ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath14 for the k100 - 00 and k100 - 10 simulations differs from the k100 - 05 simulation by no more than a few per cent across the evolution .",
    "the evolution of @xmath9 for the models starting with 0% , 5% and 10% binary frequency is shown in figure  [ f : fig2 ] . here",
    "@xmath4 is the density - weighted core - radius ( casertano & hut 1985 ) commonly used in @xmath0-body simulations and @xmath5 is the half - mass radius . these are not directly comparable to observed quantities .",
    "initially @xmath9 increases for all models .",
    "this is because the early phase corresponding to rapid mass - loss from massive stars leads to an overall expansion and the effect is greater at smaller radii .",
    "subsequent evolution has @xmath9 generally decreasing as it is dominated by the contracting core ",
    "@xmath5 continues to expand until about @xmath34gyr .",
    "after that time the half - mass radius begins to feel the effect of the decreasing tidal radius and gradually decreases from that point on .",
    "the evolution of @xmath9 is similar for all models at all times . at the @xmath26gyr end - point",
    "there is some distinction between the models with and without primordial binaries : @xmath35 in the former and @xmath36 in the latter .",
    "however , the data in figure  [ f : fig2 ] have been smoothed considerably using a moving @xmath37myr window and @xmath38myr increments . in reality",
    "the noise in the data would preclude drawing any inference regarding the primordial binary content of a cluster based on its @xmath9 measurement .",
    "this is not to say that a systematic difference in core radius would not develop if the models were allowed to evolve well in to the post - core - collapse regime .    in terms of comparing to real data the results of figure",
    "[ f : fig2 ] are not particularly useful .",
    "what is needed is a procedure that analyses the model data in the same way as is done for observations of clusters . in this way a meaningful @xmath9 ratio can be extracted . the @xmath0-body stellar evolution algorithm ( hurley , pols & tout 2000 ) provides the mass , luminosity and effective temperature of each model star . using the model atmosphere data of kurucz ( 1992 ) , supplemented by bergeron , wesemael & beauchamp ( 1995 ) for white dwarfs , these are then converted to broadband uvbri colours .",
    "it is then relatively simple to calculate the half - light radius , @xmath39 as the radius which encompasses the inner half of the total light of the cluster .",
    "this is a projected radius calculated using a 2-dimensional projection of the 3-dimensional positions of the model stars .",
    "finding the observational core - radius , which will be labelled @xmath40 , requires analysis of the cluster surface brightness profile ( sbp ) . for this",
    "it is possible to use the software described by mackey & gilmore ( 2003 ) in their work on the star clusters of the large magellanic clouds .",
    "each @xmath0-body snapshot is taken in turn and used to construct a two - dimensional projected sbp .",
    "stars more than two magnitudes brighter than the main - sequence turn - off and low - mass stars with @xmath41 are excluded  this mimics the observational process of avoiding bright stars , which may saturate , and faint stars which may be incomplete in number .",
    "note that the projection is taken along the y - axis and a choice is made to focus on the v magnitude .",
    "neither of these choices affects the results to any significant degree .",
    "next a three - parameter elson , fall & freeman ( eff : 1987 ) model is fitted to the cluster sbp to determine @xmath40 ( mackey & gilmore 2003 ) .",
    "a similar approach was taken by heggie et al .",
    "( 2006 ) although the fit was made to the three - dimensional density profile and a fourth parameter was added in order to fit the central cusp for models with a central bh .    as an example",
    "the sbp and eff model fit for the k100 - 05 simulation at @xmath32gyr is shown in figure  [ f : fig3]a .",
    "the resulting core radius is @xmath42pc . for comparison figure",
    "[ f : fig3]b shows the projected surface density profile of the same stars along with the best fitting king model ( king 1966 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath43pc in good agreement .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0-body core radius for the model cluster is @xmath44pc .",
    "values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath40 ( from eff ) and @xmath39 at @xmath32gyr for each simulation are given in table  [ t : table1 ] .",
    "figure  [ f : fig4 ] demonstrates the relationship between the @xmath0-body and observationally determined radii for the k100 - 05 simulation as it evolves .",
    "for the most part @xmath45 in agreement with baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that @xmath39 is derived from a 2-dimensional projection of the @xmath0-body data whereas @xmath5 is based on the original 3-dimensional data .",
    "simply calculating @xmath5 from a 2-dimensional projection gives a reduction of about 25% , as expected ( see fleck et al .",
    "2006 ) , and using the stellar light gives a further reduction .",
    "it can also be seen from figure  [ f : fig4 ] that for the first @xmath46gyr @xmath4 is a good approximation to @xmath40 . however , as the cluster becomes dynamically old ( @xmath47 ) this approximation is no longer valid . during core - collapse the central density increases and the value of @xmath4 computed from the density - weighted procedure decreases ( as witnessed in figure  [ f : fig2 ] ) . at the same time",
    "the remnant fraction in the core is increasing ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) which flattens the profile of the visible stars and causes @xmath40 to be greater than @xmath4 .    after repeating the sbp - fitting process for the full set of simulations",
    "figure  [ f : fig2 ] is repeated but now using @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ f : fig5 ] .",
    "this ratio , @xmath48 , can be compared to observational data .",
    "it is clearly evident that the ratio is higher than previously reported  at @xmath32gyr @xmath8 regardless of binary content and without invoking an imbh .",
    "also plotted in figure  [ f : fig5 ] is a fourth simulation , k100 - 00b .",
    "the setup for this model was identical to that of k100 - 00a except for the seed of the random number generator .",
    "however , unlike k100 - 00a this alternate model formed a bh - bh binary in the core after @xmath34gyr of evolution .",
    "the bh masses are @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the binary formed in a 3-body interaction with an initial period of @xmath51d . at @xmath26gyr",
    "it was still present in the core with a period of @xmath52d .",
    "the energy generated in 3-body encounters between this binary and stars in the core acts to ` puff - up ' the core and inflate the core radius .",
    "this is analogous to what baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) find when an imbh is present in the core .",
    "the k100 - 00b simulation maintains @xmath53 throughout the evolution and is clearly distinct from the other models from about @xmath54gyr onwards .    for comparison , the first long - lived binary in the k100 - 00a simulation also formed at about @xmath34gyr  comprised of a white dwarf and a helium star ",
    "but this simulation did not form a bh - bh binary at any point .",
    "the reason for this is related to the velocity kicks given to supernovae remnants . for the models in this work , when a neutron star or bh is born a velocity kick chosen at random from a uniform distribution between @xmath55",
    "is applied .",
    "this leads to retention fractions of 15 - 20% which is in line with the suggestions of pfahl , rappaport & podsiadlowski ( 2002 ) for gcs .",
    "the initial k100 - 00a model contained 39 main - sequence stars with mass in excess of @xmath56 , i.e. stars that would evolve to form bhs .",
    "however , only five bhs were retained in the model cluster after birth and only one of these bhs had a mass in excess of @xmath56 .",
    "the k100 - 00b model started with 42 massive main - sequence stars and had eight retained bhs , three of which where more massive than @xmath56 .",
    "so the velocity kick process , which itself is uncertain , and the related small number statistics of bh numbers , are certainly playing a role in determining the evolution histories of the models .    in figure",
    "[ f : fig6 ] the projected surface density profiles of the k100 - 00a , k100 - 00b and k100 - 05 simulations at @xmath32gyr are compared .",
    "profiles are constructed using radial bins of @xmath57 stars each and all stars are included .",
    "the profile of the k100 - 10 model is similar to that of the k100 - 05 model .",
    "comparison of the k100 - 00a and k100 - 05 profiles shows the expected result in that the single star model is more centrally condensed and would return a smaller core radius from king model fitting . by contrast",
    "the k100 - 00b profile is much flatter .",
    "thus the behaviour seen for @xmath0-body models with a central imbh ( baumgardt , makino & hut 2005 ) can be replicated by the presence of a central stellar mass bh - bh binary .",
    "finally , the k100 - 00a and k100 - 10 simulations are used to look at the effect of primordial binaries on the distribution of remnants in evolved clusters .",
    "baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2003a ) showed that the density profile of remnants ( white dwarfs , neutron stars and stellar - mass bhs ) rises more strongly in the centre of a cluster than the profile of luminous , or observable , stars .",
    "thus the mass - to - light ratio rises naturally towards the centre of a cluster without the need for an imbh .",
    "this point was shown by baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2003a ) to be important when interpreting the observed velocity dispersion profile of m15 which had been used to infer the presence of an imbh in the core ( gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ) . the baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2003a ) models did not include primordial binaries .",
    "thus the k100 - 00a model in this work can be expected to show similar behaviour .",
    "figure  [ f : fig7]a shows the projected density profiles of remnant stars and luminous stars ( main - sequence stars with @xmath58 and giants ) at @xmath32gyr .",
    "indeed the remnant profile of model k100 - 00a rises more steeply towards the centre .",
    "for this model at @xmath32gyr remnants comprised 40% of the cluster mass but only 1% of this was in the form of neutron stars and bhs . note that to probe deeper into the centre of the model clusters @xmath59 stars per bin has been used in figure  [ f : fig7 ] which explains why the profiles are more erratic than those of figures  [ f : fig3]b and [ f : fig6 ] . in figure",
    "[ f : fig7]b this exercise is repeated for the k100 - 10 model  the presence of 10% primordial binaries has erased any difference between the profiles .",
    "this is because binaries present a population of comparable average mass to the remnants and therefore segregate towards the centre on a similar timescale .",
    "this work has gone some way to fulfilling a need identified by trenti ( 2006 )  taking realistic @xmath0-body models and analyzing the snapshot data as if it were data acquired by a telescope . while these models are comparable in size to gcs at the lower end of the gc mass function ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) they",
    "should not be taken as directly applicable to gcs .",
    "the results presented are mainly for comparison to other @xmath0-body models  they provide an excellent companion to the models of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) and baumgardt , makino & ebisuzaki ( 2004 ) and a step forward in particle number compared to trenti , heggie & hut ( 2007 ) .",
    "good agreement is also found with the monte carlo models of cluster evolution performed by fregeau & rasio ( 2007 ) . across a series of models starting with @xmath1 objects ( stars and binaries ) these authors report @xmath9 values in the range @xmath60 with little to no dependence on the initial cluster profile or binary fraction .",
    "this is the same range shown for the @xmath0-body models in figure  [ f : fig2 ] , noting that the monte carlo @xmath9 is calculated using the traditional @xmath0-body method .",
    "significantly , fregeau & rasio ( 2007 ) do not see any noticeable change in @xmath9 when they move to models starting with @xmath61 objects .",
    "trenti ( 2006 ) looked at globular cluster data from the catalogue of harris ( 1996 ) to examine the distribution of @xmath9 ratios .",
    "this involved carefully selecting a sample of 57 gcs with the main determinant being that the measured half - mass relaxation timescale be less than @xmath62yr .",
    "this was to ensure that the gcs in the sample were all dynamically old  at least 10 half - mass relaxation times old based on a conservative age estimate of @xmath63gyr .",
    "the motivation for doing this was based on the demonstration by trenti ( 2006 ) that @xmath9 can only be used to distinguish between clusters with differing initial content ( single stars , primordial binaries and imbhs ) after at least 10 half - mass relaxation times have elapsed .",
    "however , this model result was based on the use of the initial half - mass relaxation timescale ( @xmath64 ) whereas the observed clusters only give the current @xmath14 . as has been shown in this work ,",
    "this can be expected to be at least a factor of two less than @xmath64 .",
    "another consideration is that @xmath14 calculated from models is using the three - dimensional half - mass radius while the value of @xmath14 quoted in the harris ( 1996 ) catalogue is based on the two - dimensional half - light radius .",
    "this can also lead to an overestimate of the true dynamical age of a cluster .",
    "thus caution is urged when comparing dynamical ages of model and real clusters .",
    "in fact , trenti ( 2006 ) also considered a refined sample based on a criterion of @xmath65yr which is more appropriate in terms of ensuring the clusters are dynamically old .",
    "this led to a sample of 25 galactic gcs .",
    "of these there are 10 with @xmath66 which is the condition used by trenti ( 2006 ) to infer the possible presence of an imbh . the larger sample considered by fregeau et al .",
    "( 2003 : see their fig .",
    "17 ) shows that in general a galactic gc is as likely to have @xmath66 than not .",
    "an important point here is that fregeau et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and trenti ( 2006 ) are using @xmath9 from models ( corresponding to figure  [ f : fig2 ] ) and this will underestimate the true ratio when compared to observations which use @xmath67 ( as given in figure  [ f : fig5 ] ) . the results presented here show that observed ratios up to at least 0.4 do not require an imbh for explanation .",
    "the median @xmath9 for the trenti ( 2006 ) sample is 0.28 which is well matched by the @xmath0-body models . as a result",
    "it is suggested , conservatively , that @xmath68 be used to distinguish clusters which require the presence of something out of the ordinary to explain their inner structure . in the harris ( 1996 )",
    "database there are six such clusters ( with @xmath65yr ) .",
    "they are e3 , terzan 3 , ngc@xmath69 , pal 6 , ngc@xmath70 and pal8 .",
    "the @xmath0-body models have shown that one explanation for a cluster observed to have a large @xmath9 ratio is the presence of a stellar mass bh - bh binary .",
    "the action of this bh - bh binary causes @xmath9 to diverge from that found in models without such a binary .",
    "this divergent behaviour occurs after about @xmath54gyr , in terms of model age ( see figure  [ f : fig5 ] ) , which in dynamical terms equates to approximately six half - mass relaxation times ( see figure  [ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "so it is possible to differentiate between models with and without a bh - bh binary before the completion of core - collapse evolution .    the findings relating to the bh - bh binary model ( k100 - 00b ) occurred very much by chance as this study in no way set out to create a model that would form such a binary .",
    "what it does demonstrate is that the random meeting of stars in a cluster ( model or real ) , and additionally the randomness introduced by velocity kicks given to supernova remnants , can have severe implications for the long - term structure and observed nature of a cluster .",
    "this particular model also showed a flattened density profile compared to the models that did not form a long - lived central bh - bh binary .",
    "baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) found that models with an imbh also gave flattened profiles .",
    "comparison to the observed surface brightness profiles of 37 galactic gcs presented by noyola & gebhardt ( 2006 ) lead to the suggestion of five clusters of interest in terms of detecting an imbh .",
    "these clusters may also be of interest for finding a bh - bh binary .",
    "the results in this study have actually made it more difficult to explain clusters with low @xmath9  approximately half of the galactic gcs have ratios less than 0.2 ( harris 1996 ; fregeau et al .",
    "2003 ; trenti 2006 ) and these can not be reached by the models ( based on inspection of figure  [ f : fig5 ] ) . however , there are two factors to note here .",
    "the first is that the results shown in figure  [ f : fig5 ] are smoothed .",
    "looking at the raw , non - smoothed , data there is much fluctuation and values below 0.2 do occur in the models at late times ( excluding the k100 - 00b model )  the average error in the smoothed @xmath48 as shown in figure  [ f : fig5 ] is approximately @xmath71 .",
    "so small values are certainly possible depending on when a cluster is ` observed ' .",
    "a word of caution is required on this point as real gcs are , in most cases , richer than the models presented here and statistical fluctuations will be smaller .",
    "the second point is uncertainty in the @xmath40 fitting process . to demonstrate this one can look at the surface density profile of model k100 - 05 at @xmath32gyr , as shown in figure  [ f : fig3]a .",
    "the king model fit shown gives @xmath72pc however , if the fitting process is biased to fit the inner @xmath73pc of the profile then values as low as @xmath74pc are plausible .",
    "it is also true that many of the gcs with @xmath75 in the harris ( 1996 ) catalogue are also flagged as core - collapse clusters and accurate measurement of @xmath40 using sbp - fitting software can be difficult for clusters passing through this phase .",
    "the interested reader can look at the sbp library in trager , king & djorgovski ( 1995 ) along with the associated description of the fitting process for core - collapse clusters .",
    "one could also expect that reducing the strength of the tidal field would lead to a reduction in @xmath9 through an increase in @xmath5 . however , there is no evidence in the galactic gc sample for a link between @xmath9 and distance from the galactic centre .",
    "note also that the models of baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) that are of comparable size to those presented here , but with an imbh in the core , actually give smaller @xmath9 values .",
    "one difference between the two sets of models is that the baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) models are isolated and indeed they do show a larger half - light radius . even after correcting for this , the baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) models with an imbh would give comparable ( not larger ) @xmath9 values to the models in this work without an imbh .",
    "so it is not clear from this comparison that clusters with an imbh should necessarily show a larger @xmath9 ratio , as suggested by the models described in trenti ( 2006 ) and theoretical arguments ( heggie et al .",
    "it is interesting to note an apparent discrepancy between the @xmath9 values reported from the imbh models of trenti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and those of baumgardt , makino & hut ( 2005 ) .",
    "modelling time - dependent tidal fields may also be important in determining the actual @xmath9 ratio , and the choice of initial conditions , such as the scale radius , may also play a role . clearly there is more work to be done in this field before we can resolve the issue of which gcs may harbour an imbh .    on one hand this investigation is suggesting that the presence of imbhs in gc cores is not so likely ",
    "intermediate @xmath9 values can be explained by models without an imbh provided the correct comparison is made and higher @xmath9 values may instead show the presence of a stellar - mass bh - bh binary .",
    "however , the models also provide an opportunity to look at how the distribution of stars in an old cluster is affected by the presence of a sizeable primordial binary population .",
    "the model with 10% primordial binaries shows that the mass distribution follows the light distribution throughout the cluster  the steeper density profile of remnant stars compared to bright stars seen in the centre of single - star models is not replicated .",
    "therefore , observations that infer a steepening mass - to - light ratio in the core of a globular cluster should not be dismissed as a possible imbh indicator ( see also gebhardt , rich & ho 2005 ) .",
    "this is provided we assume that globular clusters are born with a modest binary fraction ( hut et al .",
    "exactly how a direct model of a gc with primordial binaries and an imbh will behave is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "by treating model data as if it were observational data higher @xmath9 values than previously reported have been revealed .",
    "this provides a good match to the majority of the galactic gcs without the need for an imbh .",
    "it has also been shown that factors such as the presence of a bh - bh binary ( comprised of stellar mass bhs ) in a cluster core can flatten the measured luminosity profile and inflate the measured core - radius .",
    "none of this precludes the existence of imbhs in gc cores .",
    "however , it does demonstrate that the @xmath9 ratio can not be used with any certainty to infer the dynamical history or content of a cluster core .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank dougal mackey for providing the surface brightness profile software and douglas heggie for many helpful suggestions that improved the text .",
    "jrh thanks the swinburne research development scheme for travel support and the american museum of natural history for hosting a visit during this work .",
