    "in 1948 , casimir @xcite predicted the existence of an attractive force between two perfectly conducting plates as a manifestation of the zero - point vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields .",
    "although experimental verification of this prediction has little progress before 1997 , casimir effect has attracted more and more attention since 1970s @xcite .",
    "it was gradually realized that this effect is closely related to other areas of physics such as quantum field theory , cosmology and condensed matter physics .",
    "more recently , the advances in the casimir measurements and nanotechnology have stimulated more interest in casimir effect .",
    "historically , the casimir effect was investigated for electromagnetic field ( massless vector field ) . in 1956 , lifshitz @xcite derived a formula to express the casimir force acting between two dielectric semi - infinite slabs in terms of the permittivity of the slabs @xcite .",
    "refinements and generalizations of the lifshitz formula where the semi - infinite dielectric slabs are replaced by dielectric or magnetodielectric plates of finite thicknesses were derived in @xcite . in the limits the permittivity goes to infinity ,",
    "lifshitz formula reproduces the result of casimir for two perfectly conducting plates .    since 1970s ,",
    "casimir effect was studied for other quantum fields such as scalar fields and spinor fields , for both massless and massive sectors .",
    "in contrast , there are very few works that studied casimir effect of massive vector fields .",
    "one of the incentives to study casimir effect of massive fields comes from the prevalence of spacetime with extra dimensions which were proposed to solve some fundamental problems in physics . to study a quantum field in a spacetime with extra dimensions , one can use kaluza - klein decomposition to decompose the quantum field to an infinite tower of massive fields in @xmath3 .",
    "this approach has been intrinsically used in a number of works to study the casimir effect of scalar field or spinor field in spacetime with extra dimensions such as kaluza - klein spacetime and randall - sundrum spacetime . for electromagnetic field , the casimir effect on a pair of perfectly conducting plates in the kaluza - klein spacetime @xmath4 was studied in @xcite using the results of barton and dombey @xcite on casimir effect of massive photons .    the pioneering work of barton and dombey @xcite considered the casimir effect on a pair of perfectly conducting plates due to a massive vector field . unlike the scalar and spinor case , the extension from massless vector field to massive vector field is in fact much more complicated .",
    "the classical maxwell s equations have to be replaced by proca equations @xcite and the gauge degree of freedom is lost .",
    "therefore , a massless vector field has two polarizations but a massive vector field has three . for a pair of infinitely large perfectly conducting plates , the contribution to the casimir energy from the two polarizations are the same .",
    "however , the contributions to the casimir energy from the three polarizations are not the same .",
    "another complication in generalizing casimir effect of massless vector field to massive vector field is that besides the conventional boundary conditions which require the continuities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 across interfaces , one also need to impose the continuities of the scalar potential @xmath7 and the vector potential @xmath8 @xcite . for massless vector field where we usually impose the gauge conditions",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is not continuous for the family of tm modes .",
    "this gives an obstacle to generalizing the results from the massless case to the massive case . in @xcite ,",
    "barton and dombey showed that the eigenmodes of a massive vector field can be divided into two families of discrete modes and one family of continuum modes . in the massless limit",
    ", the contribution to the casimir energy from the discrete modes yields the result of casimir @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the casimir energy from the continuum modes has zero massless limit .",
    "one thing that worth remarked is that one family of the discrete modes corresponds to the te modes in the massless case , but the other family of discrete modes is not a direct generalization of the tm modes in the massless case .    as a first step to investigate the casimir effect on a pair of plates made of real materials in a spacetime with extra dimensions ,",
    "we generalize the work of barton and dombey @xcite to a pair of plates made of real materials in some magnetodielectric background medium .",
    "this can also be considered as generalizing the lifshitz formula for massless vector field to a formula for massive vector field . as explained above",
    ", the generalizing of the casimir effect from massless vector field to massive vector field is nontrivial even for a pair of perfectly conducting plates .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the result will even be more complicated when one considers real materials . as was discussed in @xcite , for dielectric plates ,",
    "the plane waves of a massive vector field can be divided into two families of transverse waves and one family of longitudinal waves . however ,",
    "one of the families of discrete modes for perfectly conducting plates is in fact not transverse , and the continuum modes for perfectly conducting plates is in fact not longitudinal .",
    "therefore , it is not obvious how one should generalize the work of barton and dombey @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can show that for plates made of real materials in a magnetodielectric background , only one family of the transverse modes can satisfy all the boundary conditions . as a result , to look for other eigenmodes of the massive vector field ,",
    "we are forced to consider the superposition of the other family of transverse modes and the family of longitudinal modes .    in @xcite",
    ", lifshitz modeled two dielectric plates as two semi - infinite slabs which is a reasonable model when the skin depths of the materials of the plates are much smaller than the thicknesses of the plates .",
    "the configuration of two semi - infinite slabs separated by a medium is a three - layer model .",
    "however , since we want to consider plates made of any materials , we find it necessary not to make any assumption about the skin depths .",
    "therefore , we would consider two plates with finite thicknesses which can be modeled by a five - layer configuration .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we review the proca equations for massive vector fields . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we divide the plane waves solutions to the proca equations into type i and type ii transverse waves , and longitudinal waves . in section [ s4 ] , we discuss the boundary conditions that should be satisfied by the potentials and fields on the interface of two plane parallel media . in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we derive the casimir energies contributed by transverse modes of type i , and by the superposition of transverse modes of type ii and longitudinal modes .",
    "we show that their massless limits are the te and tm contributions to the casimir energy due to a massless vector field . in section [ s6 ] ,",
    "we discuss the limiting case where the plates become perfectly conducting . in section [ s7 ]",
    ", we consider the limit when the plates become infinitely permeable . in section [ s8 ] , we study the case where one plate is perfectly conducting and one plate is infinitely permeable .",
    "a massive vector field is represented by a four - vector @xmath12 , where @xmath7 is the scalar potential and @xmath13 is the vector potential . define the electric field @xmath14 and the magnetic field @xmath15 by @xmath16 consider a magnetodielectric medium with permittivity @xmath17 and permeability @xmath18 . let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the free charge and free current in the medium . assume the usual linear relations @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the primary quantities in the maxwell s equations are the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "there is a gauge degree of freedom given by @xmath28for an arbitrary function @xmath29 .",
    "the lorentz gauge is one of the gauge conditions that can be used to fix the gauge .",
    "this gauge degree of freedom is lost in the massive case .",
    "in fact , for massive vector field , the primary quantities are the potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the electric and magnetic fields are derived quantities .",
    "the lorentz condition is a necessary condition followed from the conservation of charges .",
    "consider an unbounded magnetodielectric medium with permittivity @xmath30 and permeability @xmath18 in the absence of free chargers and currents , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as discussed in @xcite ,",

    "the equation for the vector potential @xmath8 becomes @xmath34 recall that for a massless vector field , the vector potential @xmath8 satisfies the equation with @xmath35 , and the conditions @xmath9 and @xmath36 , called coulomb gauge or radiation gauge , are usually imposed to remove the gauge degree of freedom .",
    "therefore the transverse waves are in one - to - one correspondence with the massless electromagnetic waves .",
    "since massless electromagnetic waves are usually divided into te and tm polarizations , we do the same for the massive case , but call them type i and type ii transverse waves .    in the following , let @xmath37 , @xmath38 and define @xmath39 .",

    "it should be observed that the longitudinal waves and transverse waves satisfy different dispersion relations , unless @xmath51 , i.e. , the waves traveled at the speed of light in the medium .",
    "in this section , we consider the boundary conditions that must be satisfied by the potentials @xmath8 and @xmath7 and the fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the interface of two plane parallel media in the absence of free charges and currents .",
    "let @xmath2 be the direction normal to the boundary of the two media .",
    "as in the massless case , and imply that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are continuous . taking the derivative of with respect to @xmath25 gives @xmath54the lorentz condition then imply that @xmath55therefore , we find that @xmath56must be continuous . then implies that @xmath57 has to be continuous .",

    "therefore , we also call the contribution from the superposition of type ii transverse modes and longitudinal modes the tm contribution .    in the limit where the plates become perfectly conducting , obtained by letting the permittivities of the plates tend to infinity , we write down explicitly the formulas for the te and tm contributions to the casimir energy . for general magnetodielectric background",
    ", the tm contribution can not be split into two pieces .",
    "however , when the refractive index of the background is equal to unity , which happens for instance when the background is vacuum , the tm contribution can be split into two pieces , corresponding to the contribution from type 2 discrete modes and contribution from type 3 continuum modes discussed in the work of barton and dombey @xcite . in other words ,",
    "our result reproduces the result of barton and dombey @xcite for the special case they have considered . in this case , the casimir force is always attractive .    in the limit where the plates become infinitely permeable , obtained by letting the permeabilities of the plates tend to infinity , the tm contribution to the casimir energy",
    "can always be split into a sum of two terms . in this case , the casimir force is always attractive when the background has constant refractive index .    to look for possible scenario that leads to repulsive force , we consider the configuration proposed by boyer @xcite , where one plate is perfectly conducting and one plate is infinitely permeable . in this case , we find that the tm contribution to the casimir force can not be split into a sum of two terms even when the background medium has unity refractive index .",
    "numerical computation shows that the casimir force can become attractive for nonzero masses when the refractive index of the background medium is not one .",
    "this shows that compare to the massless case , the casimir effect of a massive vector field can behave very differently ."
