    "blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) characterised by distinctive and extreme observational properties , such as large amplitude and rapid variability , superluminal motion , and strong emission over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "blazars also host a jet , pointing almost directly to the observer , within which relativistic particles moving in a magnetic field radiate by losing their energy @xcite , at variance with most agn whose energy production is mostly through accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "the two main blazar sub - classes , namely bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , differ mostly in their optical spectra , with the latter displaying strong , broad emission lines and the former instead being characterised by optical spectra showing at most weak emission lines , sometimes exhibiting absorption features , and in many cases being completely featureless .",
    "although blazars represent a small fraction of agn , the interest in this type of peculiar and rare sources is growing as they are being found in increasing large numbers in high galactic latitude surveys performed at microwave and  energies @xcite .",
    "blazars represent also the most abundant extragalactic population at tev energies .",
    "very recently @xcite , on the basis of a joint positional and energetic diagnostic , have even suggested a possible association between bl lacs and seven neutrino events reported by the icecube collaboration @xcite .    in a recent paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) we proposed a new paradigm , which is based on light dilution , minimal assumptions on the physical properties of the non - thermal jet emission , and unified schemes .",
    "these posit that bl lacs and fsrqs are simply low - excitation ( lergs)/fanaroff - riley ( fr ) i and high - excitation ( hergs)/fr ii radio galaxies with their jets forming a small angle with respect to the line of sight .",
    "we called this new approach the _ blazar simplified view _ ( bsv ) . by means of detailed monte carlo simulations ,",
    "paper i showed that the bsv scenario is consistent with the complex observational properties of blazars as we know them from all the surveys carried out so far in the radio and x - ray bands , solving at the same time a number of long - standing issues .    in a subsequent paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) we extended the monte carlo simulations to the  band ( 100 mev  100 gev ) and found that our results matched very well the observational properties of blazars in the _",
    "fermi_-lat 2-yr source catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2lac ) and the _ fermi_-lat data of a sample of radio selected blazars @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently put together a sample of @xmath4 high synchrotron peaked ( hsp ) blazars , that is objects with the frequency of the synchrotron peak  @xmath5 hz .",
    "this was defined starting from a primary list of infrared ( ir ) colour - colour selected sources from the allwise survey , based on data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and applying further restrictions on ir - radio and ir - x - ray flux ratios .",
    "this so - called wise hsp ( 1whsp ) sample is currently the largest sample of confirmed and candidate hsp blazars .",
    "all these objects are expected to accelerate particles to the highest observed energies and radiate up to the very high energy @xmath6-ray band .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to push into the very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath7 gev ) band of the electromagnetic spectrum by extrapolating our simulations from the lower energy ( _ fermi _ )  band and : a ) make detailed predictions for current and future imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , including the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) ; b ) compare our predictions with the number of observed bright 1whsp sources .",
    "as in paper i  and ii we use a @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our goal is to estimate the properties of a vhe flux - limited blazar sample , building upon the simulations presented in paper i  and paper ii , applying the same prescriptions . in paper ii",
    "we were mainly interested in distributions , trends , and average values . to make our predictions as robust as possible , in view of the required extrapolations , in this paper we reproduced the absolute numbers in the _ fermi _",
    "2lac catalogue as well .",
    "this required some minimal fine tuning and a very small number of changes to our input parameters , which do not have any impact on our previous results .",
    "our monte carlo simulations construct the radio through @xmath6-ray spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars at different redshifts and are based on various ingredients , which include : the blazar luminosity function and evolution , a distribution of the lorentz factor of the electrons and of the doppler factor , a synchrotron inverse compton model , an accretion disk component , the host galaxy .",
    "a series of @xmath6-ray constraints based on observed distributions estimated using _ simultaneous _ multi - frequency data are also included : namely , the distribution of compton dominance , the dependence of the @xmath6-ray spectral index on , and that of the @xmath6-ray flux on radio flux density .",
    "sources are classified as bl lacs , fsrqs , or radio galaxies based on the optical spectrum , as normally done with real surveys .",
    "readers are referred to paper i  and ii for full details .",
    "the seds were extrapolated to the vhe band by using our simulated _ fermi_fluxes and spectral indices and assuming a break at @xmath13 and a steepening of the photon spectrum by @xmath14 .",
    "our default values are @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 .",
    "the former is consistent with the seds shown in fig . 8 in @xcite , while the latter has been derived as follows : we calculated @xmath17 for the sources in tab . 1 and 2 of @xcite with @xmath18 to minimise the effect of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) absorption",
    "the resulting value is @xmath19 which , since ebl absorption is important at higher energies even at low redshifts , should be taken as a conservative value . to see",
    "how strongly our results depend on this choice we employed also a harder spectrum , that is one with @xmath20 gev and @xmath21 .",
    "vhe spectra were attenuated using recent estimates of the ebl absorption as a function of redshift @xcite .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we refer to the two different extrapolations as `` soft '' and `` hard '' respectively .",
    "we present the integral number counts as a function of photon flux ( @xmath22 gev ) for our default vhe extrapolation ( @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : class_abs_unabs ] .",
    "the number counts for the whole blazar sample with and without ebl absorption are shown as black solid and dotted curves respectively .",
    "we note that the ratio between the two curves is approximately constant and @xmath23 , which ultimately stems from our intrinsic spectral slopes and redshift distributions .",
    "[ fig : class_abs_unabs ] also displays the number counts with and without ebl absorption for bl lacs ( red lines ) , and fsrqs ( blue lines ) . for the case of no absorption (",
    "i.e. assuming a fully transparent universe ) bl lacs are @xmath24 times more abundant than fsrqs , which is a strong selection effect to their very different vhe seds .",
    "since ebl absorption affects fsrqs much more than bl lacs , due to the larger redshifts of the former , an even higher ratio ( @xmath25 ) between the two classes is expected when absorption is taken into consideration .",
    "[ fig : nz ] gives a vivid impression of this effect by showing the redshift distribution of bl lacs and fsrqs before and after taking into account ebl absorption ( for the case @xmath26 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 ) .",
    "we note that even after the ebl correction some fsrqs are still detectable up to @xmath28 ( see below ) .",
    "gev as a function of photon flux with and without ebl absorption ( dashed and solid lines respectively ) for all blazars ( black lines ) , bl lacs ( red lines ) , and fsrqs ( blue lines ) ( @xmath15 gev and @xmath16).,height=230 ]     photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 , @xmath15 gev and @xmath16).,height=309 ]      we start by estimating the number of blazars , which are within reach of present iacts .",
    "this depends on the current typical sensitivity , which is @xmath29423 , which according to @xcite is `` one of the faintest sources ever detected in the very high energy ( @xmath0 gev ) extragalactic sky '' and , given the fit in the paper , has @xmath30 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 ; 2 . tab . 1 of @xcite , where a single source has an integral flux @xmath31 of the crab ( @xmath32 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 ) , while five others are at a level @xmath33 of the crab ( @xmath34 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10).]@xmath35 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 ( @xmath36 14 mc.u . )",
    "gev ) = @xmath37 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 assuming a spectrum @xmath38 . ] .",
    "we find @xmath39 blazars all - sky without any ebl absorption , which reduce to @xmath40 ( @xmath41 in the case of the harder vhe spectrum ) once ebl absorption is taken into account . of these",
    ", @xmath42 are bl lacs ( 7% fsrqs and 2% radio galaxies : see below ) , a fraction , which is similar to the observed one in tevcat ( @xmath43 ) , the online catalogue for vhe astronomy .",
    "even our predicted fraction of hsp bl lacs , @xmath44 , is close to the observed one ( 86% ) .",
    "very recently magic has detected vhe photons from s4 0218 + 35 , an fsrq at @xmath3 , during a flaring event @xcite .",
    "this implies a fraction of fsrqs at @xmath45 @xmath46 , which is also not too far from our prediction of @xmath47 .",
    "the total number , however , is quite different , with only 54 blazars detected so far .",
    "this is easily explained by the fact that tevcat , although extremely useful , is only a list of tev sources that is subject to large biases , as there are no all - sky flux - limited tev catalogues at the moment ( with the exception of the galactic plane : * ? ? ?",
    "sources in fact are often pointed by iacts when found in a high state in other bands .",
    "we then predict that @xmath1 blazars are waiting to be detected at e  @xmath48  100 gev by current iacts . for many of these discovery should be relatively easy , as detailed in the next section .    to take into account the fact that the energy threshold of iacts depends on zenith angle we have estimated the fraction of the sky covered by hess and veritas / magic ( fig",
    ". 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* where the blind spots corresponds to zenith angles @xmath49 ) , which turned out to be @xmath50 .",
    "our values are therefore overestimated by @xmath51 , which is well within the range bracketed by our soft and hard extrapolations .",
    "the latest generation of iacts , ( i.e. magic - ii and hess - ii ) has a lowered energy threshold reaching a few tens of gev , with limiting integrated sensitivity of @xmath52 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 at e @xmath53 gev @xcite .",
    "maximum sensitivity , in terms of c.u .",
    ", is however reached at higher energies : at e  @xmath54 gev the integrated limiting flux is @xmath55 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the number of blazar detections expected by our simulations above these limits accounting for ebl absorption is @xmath56 ( 87% bl lacs , 11% fsrqs ) assuming e  @xmath53 gev , and @xmath57 , ( 96% bl lacs , 2% fsrqs ) for the case e  @xmath54 gev ( these numbers increase by @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively in the case of the harder vhe spectrum ) .",
    "note that iacts sensitivities are estimated for a crab - like spectrum , which is not always representative of blazars .",
    "this , combined with the well known large variability of this type of agn , especially just below 100 gev where the steep tail of the gev emission from fsrqs may play a crucial role , makes the above estimates only indicative of average values .",
    "iacts observations simultaneous with optical or x - ray flares may lead to a larger number of detections .      @xcite have recently assembled the 1whsp catalogue , the largest sample of confirmed and candidate hsp blazars .",
    "although technically not a @xmath6-ray catalogue , it represents at present the best way to compensate for the lack of large ( @xmath60 ) sky coverage in the vhe band for blazars .",
    "1whsp sources have in fact been shown to be strong @xmath6-ray sources : @xmath61 of them are confirmed gev emitters and 35 have already been detected in the tev band . @xcite",
    "have defined a `` figure of merit '' ( fom ) on the potential detectability of their sources in the vhe band , defined as the ratio between the synchrotron ( @xmath62 ) peak flux of a source and that of the faintest blazar in the 1whsp sample already detected in the vhe band .",
    "most of the sources with fom @xmath63 at low and intermediate redshifts ( @xmath64 ) should be detectable by the current iacts , while the majority of the 1whsp sample should be within reach of the upcoming cta .",
    "assuming that the synchrotron peak flux scales as the vhe flux and for a typical sensitivity reachable by current iacts @xmath65 mc.u .",
    "we predict @xmath66 sources above such flux and with  @xmath5 hz in the 1whsp catalogue , which reduce to @xmath67 once the effect of the ebl is taken into account . in the case of a harder spectrum",
    "these numbers almost double .",
    "these values need to be compared with the number of 1whsp sources with fom @xmath68 , which is @xmath69 , i.e. larger than expected by our default ( soft ) vhe extrapolation .",
    "the requirements that all sources have an x - ray counterpart and good wise photometry in at least three bands , furthermore , imply that the 1whsp catalogue is somewhat incomplete , which might suggest that the intrinsic vhe spectrum of blazars is closer to our harder extrapolation than to the softer one .",
    "we have also made detailed predictions for two distinct hypothetical cta surveys : @xmath70 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 ( 5 mcrab units [ mc.u . ] ) and a coverage of 10,000 square degrees ( survey 1 : larger area , shallower limit ) and @xmath71 photon @xmath27 s@xmath10 ( 2.5 mc.u . ) and a coverage of 2,500 square degrees ( survey 2 : smaller area , deeper limit ) .",
    "our results are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : cta1_1 ]  [ tab : cta2_2 ] for the unabsorbed and absorbed cases and for the two different vhe extrapolations . based on our simulations",
    "we can draw the following conclusions :    * the total number of blazars expected in survey 1 is @xmath72 but can be even higher ( @xmath73 ) in the case of a harder spectrum .",
    "however , the ebl reduces the sample to @xmath74 objects ( @xmath75 more for the harder vhe extrapolation ) , with @xmath42 of them being bl lacs . in survey 2 ( the deeper but smaller one )",
    "we expect slightly less than half the number of sources ; * the mean redshift of the sources gets smaller when ebl absorption is applied , which is an obvious consequence of the fact that higher redshifts are more affected . what is less obvious is that the mean redshift of fsrqs is still @xmath76 , which means that some of these targets can be detected up to @xmath77 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nz ] for the survey 1 case .",
    "the very recent vhe detection of s4 0218 + 35 at @xmath3 by magic is in full agreement with this prediction ; * the fraction of bl lacs with redshift increases when the effect of the ebl is taken into account from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sources with no measurable redshift are those with the optical spectra swamped by non - thermal emission , which tend to have a more powerful jet and therefore are on average at higher intrinsic redshift .",
    "therefore , these are more absorbed than the other bl lacs ; * as was the case in paper i  and paper ii  a small fraction ( @xmath80 ) of the simulated blazars are classified as radio galaxies .",
    "these are bona - fide blazars misclassified by current classification schemes because their non - thermal radiation is not strong enough to dilute the host galaxy component even in the ca h&k break region of the optical spectrum ( see paper i  and ii for more details )",
    ". being typically at low redshifts , these sources are not very much affected by the ebl .",
