    "superfluids have become a useful experimental and theoretical tool for investigation of the basic concepts and properties of turbulence , from cascades to intermittency .",
    "many similarities between turbulence in classical and quantum fluids have been found , such as the kolmogorov spectrum observed experimentally in helium @xcite , @xcite , and found theoretically in the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) model @xcite , the dissipation dynamics measured in helium in the quasiclassical regime of quantum turbulence ( qt ) @xcite , @xcite , and strong intermittency in qt @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recent studies of qt revealed that the vortex bundles are crucial for the kolmogorov spectrum of qt @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the bundles are a counterpart of the coherent structures in classical turbulence ( ct ) @xcite .    however , strong differences exist between qt and ct , first of all , because of the underlying velocity fields .",
    "the quantum counterpart of the classical sheet - like spatial structure of vorticity of the flow , which becomes turbulent due to roll - up caused by the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) , has been missing in qt so far . the topological charge [ i.e. , vorticity of quantum fluid defined before eq .",
    "( 8) ] , in qt is a tangle of one - dimensional ( 1d ) lines where the phase of the superfluid wavefunction is singular ( collection of vortex points in 2d qt ) .",
    "the characteristic vortex core size is @xmath1 @xcite in ultracold gases , and @xmath2 in superfluid helium @xcite . in 3d",
    "qt vorticity decays @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is time , in contrast to @xmath5 for the quasiclassical regime @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of a different mechanism of dissipation of incompressible kinetic energy ( in other words , the transverse contribution to the kinetic energy ) in qt : viscosity is absent , and decrease of the vortex line length happens due to its collisions and reconnections .",
    "another signature of qt is velocity statistics at wavenumbers of a superfluid described by a wavefunction @xmath6 , is @xmath7 , i.e. is proportional to the wavenumber @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is number density , and @xmath10 is atomic mass . ]",
    "larger than the inverse mean intervortex distance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "incompressibility is usually a very good approximation in helium because mean intervortex separation is much larger than the core size @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the compressible effects become important for dynamics on scales comparable to the core size , especially in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , with several non - trivial consequences such as sound generation due to reconnections @xcite , thermal dissipation @xcite , @xcite , direct @xcite and inverse @xcite energy cascades in two - dimensional qt , and make qt quite peculiar .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask , is it possible to find deeper relations between the superfluid and the classical turbulence using available experimental systems ?",
    "here we address this issue by considering the gp model which describes binary bec @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that in the thermodynamic limit bose - einstein condensation can take place only in 3d [ 25 ] .",
    "here we utilize the term `` bec '' for brevity , implying that the entire cloud of atoms is superfluid and phase - coherent .",
    "contrary to single - component becs , in binary becs close to the su(2 ) symmetry considered here ( see sec .",
    "iia for details ) , vortex cores of one component filled by nonrotating atoms of the other component do not produce significant total density gradients . thus , in turbulence the total density does not experience significant perturbations , the total fluid velocity should be almost incompressible , and the spectrum of the total quantum kinetic energy is expected to obey the kolmogorov scaling .",
    "the present work is based on our previous theoretical studies where we investigated the rti in ultracold @xmath11 @xcite , and explored some alternative scenarios @xcite . here",
    "we utilize the same physical model of two immiscible becs with two opposite atomic spinswhich makes possible the exertion of the opposite forces on both components by an inhomogenous magnetic field , as first suggested by the authors of [ 28 ] .",
    "the magnetic field creates excess of the position - dependent potential energy of each bec component , and leads to the rti .",
    "the atomic magnetic moment together with the twocomponent character of superfluid , are essential for the manipulation of the condensate components and open up the way to stir the superfluid in a controlled way .",
    "generally , the miscibility of superfluids is determined by stability of a uniform mixture with respect to density fluctuations . when the second - order energy perturbation is positive definite , the system is miscible . for such external trapping potentials when",
    "quantum pressure of each superfluid in the relevant spatial dimensions can be neglected ( the thomas - fermi approximation ) , the stability condition is equivalent to @xmath12 , and @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 are the interaction parameters ( see sec .",
    "iia for details ) .",
    "thus , immiscible systems satisfy @xmath15 .",
    "the stirring procedure that we propose , is based on the rayleigh - taylor instability ( rti ) @xcite,@xcite and the khi @xcite . the former triggers the components mixing , while the latter performs the actual stirring of the superfluids .",
    "we reveal a special role of qt in immiscible and its @xmath16-component : the non - linear spin - dependent contribution to the total energy is @xmath17 @xcite , being negative definite for @xmath18 , which implies local maximization of @xmath19 . ]",
    "superfluids close to su(2)-symmetry , which is equivalent to equal atomic masses @xmath10 , equal non - linear interaction parameters @xmath20 , equal bulk densities of the two becs , and small interspecies repulsion parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we show in eq .",
    "( [ rti ] ) and below that the interface tension between the components is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "dimension of the topological charge makes binary qt fundamentally different from the previously studied cases for single - component superfluids @xcite .",
    "although dimension of the vorticity structure of miscible superfluids @xcite , and immiscible superfluids with strong inter - component repulsion @xcite is the same as of weakly repulsive becs considered here , the mean of turbulent vorticity of weakly repulsive superfluids is still associated with different structures . because of immiscibility , sheet - like structures are the most favorable vorticity structures , in contrast to tube - like structures in miscible superfluids . in strongly repulsive superfluids ,",
    "sheet - like structures may be present , but they are stabilized with respect to the khi [ 27 ] , and are not expected to be structures where the mean turbulent vorticity resides .",
    "thus , although still created by quantized phase windings of superfluid wave functions , the topological charge of weakly repulsive becs is non - quantized ( because the interfacial shear motion may be arbitrarily slow ) , and represents a quantum counterpart of the random vorticity field of ct .",
    "in hydrodynamics of classical fluids , the rti occurs at the interface between fluids in the gravitational field . in the simplest case",
    "the interface is flat and perpendicular to the gravitational force .",
    "when a lighter fluid is above a heavier one , waves on the interface are stable , and the spectrum of the capillary - gravitational waves is real for all wavenumbers .",
    "however in the opposite situation , fluids tend to swap their locations : the lighter fluid moves up , and heavier fluid falls down lowering the potential energy .",
    "in fact , before the swapping the fluid is in the unstable ( hydrostatic ) equilibrium unless the interface is slightly perturbed .",
    "perturbation wavelength must be sufficiently long to cause the rti .    in the context of ultracold boson gas",
    "the role of gravity can be taken by the magnetic field .",
    "the force results from spatially - dependent energy of interaction of atomic magnetic moments of superfluid with the magnetic field , and acts perpendicularly to the interface .",
    "the spatial dependence of energy is caused by a spatially uniform @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is external magnetic field , @xmath25 is along the interface , and @xmath16 is perpendicular to the interface .",
    "we focus on 2d dynamics considering two becs residing in two halves of the harmonic trap .",
    "the number of atoms @xmath26 , and the scattering lengths @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the bohr radius , are the same for both becs .",
    "the interspecies scattering length is @xmath29 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , in the ground state the becs are immiscible , and the interface between them is plane as shows fig . 1 a.     and @xmath30 .",

    "the relative shear motion is generated on the sides of the growing perturbations ( one of them is shown by arrow ) , which leads to the khi and mushroom - shaped bubbles .",

    "where @xmath42 coordinate does not appear , but the frequency @xmath43 is necessary for calculation of the 2d interaction parameters @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions along all directions are periodic .",
    "in fact , any non - zero driving field removes the periodicity , but since we ensure that number density of bec is negligible at the edge of computational field compared to the bulk value , the periodic boundary conditions is a reasonable numerical approximation .",

    "the interface perturbation starts to grow due to the rti , producing layers of the binary superfluid with shear motion , shown by the arrow in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "in contrast to single - component superfluids where fluid layers can not have shear motion , here it is possible due to two - component character of the superfluid .",

    "the total fluid velocity of a non - singular quantum vortex remains finite unlike in single - component superfluids .",

    "for this numerical simulation we used a 2d grid with 512@xmath116512 points .",
    "although the simulation conserves the total energy within less than one percent ( and the error oscillates in time giving a constant mean value ) , the resolution tests show that the error systematically decreases with increase of the grid points number not changing the result of simulations .",
    "we then analyse the resulting turbulence .",

    "the dynamical viscous length scale is given by the vortex core size @xmath138 .",
    "importantly , for weakly repulsive becs the viscous scale is larger than the healing length by a factor of @xmath139 , which distinguishes weakly repulsive becs from single - component superfluids and strongly repulsive or attractive becs . as the integral scale",
    "we take @xmath140 because it corresponds to almost homogenous total density region in the trap centre .",
    "it is interesting to note that in contrast to one - component gp turbulence @xcite , no thermal dissipation is needed in our system to obtain the kolmogorov spectrum because , first , the dynamical viscous scale is larger than the healing length where the thermal dissipation is important @xcite , and second , because the kinetic energy is just a small fraction of the total energy .",
    "the latter fact implies that the `` large '' energies associated with trap and non - linear interactions act as a `` reservoir '' shifting the dissipative length scale .",
    "in addition to the universal kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy , turbulence in superfluids with spin degrees of freedom exhibits a self - similar cascade of the spin - dependent energy of contact atom - atom interaction .",
    "two - component gp equations may be represented as a pseudospin system @xcite , and therefore the universal spin - energy scaling @xmath141 recently proposed for spinor turbulent bose - einstein condensates in the ferromagnetic phase @xcite is expected to hold as well .",
    "we check this by angle - averaging the dimensionless spin - dependent energy density @xmath142 in fourier space similarly to eq . (",

    "presumably the slightly larger slope in our case is due to the parameter @xmath33 being much smaller than in @xcite .",
    "to reveal the physics behind the kolmogorov spectrum formation in our system , we further consider the basic process of the quantum vorticity generation on the sides of the rt bubbles , the khi .",
    "one of these sides is marked by an arrow in fig . 1 ( b ) , where the relative shear motion is along a locally flat interface .",
    "to get insight into the mechanism of rolling - up of the interface on the later stage of the rti , we then consider a model problem - the khi in a two - dimensional harmonic trap unconfined in the direction of motion ( along @xmath25 axis , _ i.e. _ @xmath64 ) and non - stratified ( @xmath144 ) .    in classical fluid dynamics",
    "the khi is instability of the interface between the fluid layers with relative shear motion . in superfluids such situation",
    "is possible only for a mixture , because velocity field of each superfluid is potential . to initiate the shear flow along the interface ,",

    "our system is a weakly repulsive binary bec , @xmath79 .",
    "this leads to the fundamental difference of the present qt and the qt studied previously : here the quasi - classical roll - up of the vorticity sheet is favorable and represents a quantum counterpart of the basic process of generation of ct .    similarly to the 2d ct where vorticity accumulates on the mode with the largest possible wavelength , the khi in our 2d system with weakly repulsive intercomponent interaction @xmath149 , produces a bundle of quantum vortices , with the largest possible size , figs .",

    "a very convenient feature of our system is possibility to generate binary quantum turbulence with arbitrarily low mach numbers .",
    "the mach number characteristic to our system is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the characteristic dimensionless shear flow velocity induced by the magnetic driving force ( discussed in sec .",

    "we find that the mach number scales as @xmath158 , and may be made arbitrarily small by taking larger @xmath34 .    owing to low mach number , the total fluid dynamics is to a good approximation incompressible , while dynamics of each of the condensates is compressible because within the tf radius of the total fluid each component has large regions of low density .",
    "vortices appear and annihilate by pairs leading to non - conservation of the enstrophy in the 2d system .",
    "we find that soon after the instant of switch - off of the driving field , the integrated vorticity @xmath106 decreases in time which shows that our two - dimensional system exhibits unique properties @xcite : being incompressible ( its total density is almost unaffected by dynamics ) it demonstrates essential features of compressible 2d dynamics ( annihilation of vortex pairs - enstrophy non - conservation ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied for the first time qt generated by the rti and khi , and showed that the kolmogorov scaling law holds in weakly repulsive immiscible qt . the structure of topological charge ( vorticity ) in weakly repulsive binary superfluids is different from previously studied types in superfluid turbulence . in 2d",

    "<S> the present qt may be generated at arbitrarily small mach numbers , which is a unique property not found in previously studied superfluids . by numerical solution of the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations we find that the kolmogorov scaling law holds for the incompressible kinetic energy . </S>",
