    "recent cosmological observations indicate late - time acceleration of the observable universe @xcite . why the evolution of the universe is interposed between an early inflationary phase and the late - time acceleration",
    "is a yet - unresolved problem .",
    "various theoretical attempts have been undertaken to confront this observational fact . although the simplest way to explain this behavior is the consideration of a cosmological constant @xcite , the known fine - tuning problem @xcite led to the dark energy paradigm .",
    "here one introduces exotic dark energy component in the form of scalar fields such as quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite etc .",
    "quintessence is based on scalar field models using a canonical field with a slowly varying potential . on the other hand",
    "the models grouped under k - essence are characterized by noncanonical kinetic terms .",
    "a key feature of the k - essence models is that the cosmic acceleration is realized by the kinetic energy of the scalar field .",
    "the popular models under this category include the phantom model , the ghost - condensate model etc @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the late time cosmic acceleration requires an exotic equation of state @xmath0 . from the seven year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap7 )",
    "observations data , distance measurements from the bao and the hubble constant measurements the value of a constant eos for dark energy has been estimated as @xmath1 for flat universe @xcite .",
    "primary results from pan - starrs in fact pushes this limit further @xcite though the full data is yet to arrive . no scalar field dark energy model with canonical kinetic energy term",
    "can achieve @xmath2 .",
    "for this one has to consider a scalar field theory with negative kinetic energy along with a field potential .",
    "the resulting phantom model @xcite is extensively used to confront cosmological observation @xcite .",
    "the phantom model is however ridden with various instabilities as its energy density is unbounded .",
    "this instability can be eliminated in the so - called ghost - condensate ( gc ) models @xcite by including a term quadratic in the kinetic energy . in this context",
    "let us note that to realize the late - time acceleration scenario some self - interaction must be present in the phantom model .",
    "in contrast , in the gc models the inclusion of self - interaction potential of the scalar field is believed to be a matter of choice @xcite .",
    "this fact , though not unfamiliar , has not been emphasised much in the literature . in the present paper",
    "we show that by including a potential term in the gc model brings more flexibility in realising the phantom evolution .",
    "it is well - known that the gc model without the potential resides within the phantom regime for a certain range of values of the scalar field kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate here that these range is widened in presence of a generic potential term .",
    "note that this widening is a consequence of the field theoretic aspects of the present dark energy model .",
    "also it crucially depends on the positive energy condition .",
    "the question arises whether these conditions for achieving the phantom regime are consistent with the scalar field dynamics or not .",
    "now the scalar field dynamics is not independent but is coupled with gravity .",
    "usually one assumes a specific potential and the consequent evolution is studied .",
    "but in this paper our objective is to point out the advantage of including a potential in the gc model for achieving the phantom regime .",
    "thus we start with an arbitrary potential and exploit a specific feature of the gc action to show that the potential can be expressed in terms of observable parameters ( e.g. @xmath3 ) once the evolution of the scale factor is chosen .",
    "naturally we use the phantom power law here .",
    "consequently the kinetic and potential energy are expressed as functions of time .",
    "we still require observational data to fix the geometric parameters appearing in these functional relations so that their time - evolutions can be explicitly obtained . for this purpose",
    "the combined wmap7+bao+hubble data will be used .",
    "the potential and kinetic energy are plotted .",
    "the plots clearly show that the criteria derived here for our model to realize the phantom evolution hold throughout the entire late - time evolution .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the ghost - condensate model with an arbitrary potential .",
    "the equations of motion for the scalar field and the scale factor are derived .",
    "these equations exhibit the coupling between the scalar field dynamics and gravity .",
    "expressions for the energy density and pressure of the dark energy components are computed .",
    "these expressions are used in section iii to find the criteria for the model to acquire phantom evolution . in section",
    "iv we utilize an obvious algebric consistency which leads to a quadratic equation in the potential . solving this",
    "the generic potential is expressesed in terms of measurable geometric quantities . to fix these geometric quantities phantom power law evolution",
    "is assumed and the combined wmap7+bao+hubble data is used in section v. the explicite time variations of the potential and the kinetic energy are obtained .",
    "we provide the plots of these quantities throughout the late - time evolution .",
    "remarkably the conditions for the phantom regime given in section iii are observed to hold .",
    "finally we conclude in section vi .",
    "in this section we consider the ghost - condensate model with a self - interaction potential @xmath4 .",
    "the action is given by @xmath5 , \\label{ghost}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 @xmath7 is a mass parameter , @xmath8 the ricci scalar and @xmath9 the gravitational constant .",
    "the term @xmath10 accounts for the total ( dark plus baryonic ) matter content of the universe , which is assumed to be a barotropic fluid with energy density @xmath11 and pressure @xmath12 , and equation - of - state parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we neglect the radiation sector for simplicity .",
    "the action given by equation ( [ ghost ] ) describes a scalar field interacting with gravity . invoking the cosmological principle one requires the metric to be of the robertson - walker ( rw ) form @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the cosmic time",
    ", @xmath16 is the spatial radial coordinate , @xmath17 is the 2-dimensional unit sphere volume , @xmath18 characterizes the curvature of 3-dimensional space and @xmath19 is the scale factor .",
    "the einstein equations lead to the freidman equations @xmath20 in the above a dot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath21 is the hubble parameter . in these expressions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the energy density and pressure of the scalar field .",
    "the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined through the symmetric energy - momentum tensor @xmath24 a straightforward calculation gives @xmath25 assuming a perfect fluid model we identify @xmath26 the equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath27 can be derived from the action ( [ ghost ] ) . due to the isotropy of the flrw universe",
    "the scalar field is a function of time only .",
    "consequently , its equation of motion reduces to @xmath28 as is well known the same equation of motion follows from the conservation of @xmath29 .",
    "indeed under isotropy the equations ( [ density ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) reduce to @xmath30 from the conservation condition @xmath31 we get @xmath32 which , written equivalently in field terms gives equation ( [ eqm ] ) .    to complete the set of differential equations ( [ fr1 ] ) , ( [ fr2 ] ) , ( [ rhodot ] ) we include the equation for the evolution of matter density @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the matter equation of state parameter .",
    "the solution to equation ( [ rhomdot ] ) can immediately be written down as @xmath35^{n } , \\label{rhom}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the value of matter density at present time @xmath38 .",
    "now , the set of equations ( [ fr1 ] ) , ( [ fr2 ] ) , ( [ rhodot ] ) and ( [ rhomdot ] ) must give the dynamics of the scalar field under gravity in a self - consistent manner .",
    "in the next section we investigate the criteria for the gc model to realise the phantom evolution .",
    "the phantom regime is demarcated by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) parameter defined as @xmath41 in the present section we investigate the criteria for our model to be in the phantom regime using the definition ( [ omega ] ) only without recourse to actual dynamics . from equation ( [ rhophi ] ) and ( [ pphi ] ) , the eos parameter for the field @xmath27 is obtained as @xmath42 defining @xmath43 ( [ omegaphi ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath44 this equation is more suitable to discuss the conditions for achieving the phantom regime .    1 .",
    "first assume that there is no self - interaction , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "the positive energy condition ensures that @xmath46 .",
    "thus , for @xmath47 we require @xmath48 .",
    "these lead to the following bounds @xcite @xmath49 so that the phantom regime is attained .",
    "2 .   now suppose , @xmath50 . from the positive energy condition @xmath51 , ( see equation ( [ rhophi ] ) ) we get + @xmath52 + the only restriction imposed is now @xmath53 . of course @xmath54 is real so we now require + @xmath55    comparing the equations ( [ criteria_1 ] ) and ( [ cond_2 ] ) it is clear that inclusion of appropriate self - interaction provides greater flexibility to realise the phantom domain . in the phantom domain",
    "the scale factor evolves according to the phantom power law @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the present time and big - rip time @xcite respectively .",
    "these parameters are obtained from observational data . in this connection",
    "it is important to note that the condition ( [ cond_2 ] ) is obtained from the definition of the eos ( [ omega ] ) which in turn follows from the particular energy - momentum tensor obtained from the model ( [ l ] , [ kinetic ] ) .",
    "such quantities have been termed as the ` physical variables ' in the literature @xcite .",
    "in contrast the geometric quantities ( e.g. the hubble parameter @xmath59 and its time - derivative ) are determined from observations in a model - independent way @xcite .",
    "naturally one wonders whether the dynamical evolution of the system according to the phantom power law always conforms with the condition ( [ cond_2 ] ) .    at this point",
    ", one should note that in general , the dynamical evolution of the fields can not be worked out if the potential is not specified .",
    "however , as emphasised in the introduction , a specific aspect fo the gc model ( [ l ] , [ kinetic ] ) allows us to express the arbitrary potential in terms of geometric quantities .",
    "consequently , the field variables and the potential here can be expressed as function of time once the geometric parameters involved in ( [ phantom_power_law ] ) are fixed from observational data .",
    "it will then be possible to answer whether our criteria remains satisfied with the phantom evolution throughout the late time .",
    "in this section we will exploit the structure of the model ( [ l ] , [ kinetic ] ) to establish an algebraic identity which will enable us to express the generic potential in terms of geometric quantities .",
    "we start by constructing two independent combinations of the pressure and energy density of the dark energy sector in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath60 , matter energy density @xmath61 , matter equation of state parameter @xmath62 and curvature parameter @xmath18 using ( [ fr1 ] ) , ( [ fr2 ] ) and ( [ rhomdot ] ) @xmath63 using equations ( [ rhophi ] ) and ( [ pphi ] ) , we rewrite these combinations in terms of the ghost - condensate field derivative @xmath54 and potential @xmath64 : @xmath65 inverting the equations ( [ a1 ] , [ b1 ] ) we can write @xmath66 and @xmath67 in terms of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath64 as @xmath70 \\label{b2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that there is an obvious suggestion lurking behind the equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) , namely , the algebraic identity @xmath71 if one substitutes both sides of the identity from equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) an equation is obtained which contains only geometric quantities , except for the potential .",
    "thus it allows us to express the arbitrary potential in terms of these geometric quantities . note",
    "further that the statement holds because we have already agreed to assume the phantom power law with the geometric parameters appearing in it fixed by observational data .",
    "this is clearly the unique feature of the ghost - condensate model ( [ l ] , [ kinetic ] ) which has been referred to in the above .",
    "utilizing the identity we obtain the following equation quadratic in @xmath72 @xmath73    at this point one may ask whethar the constraining equation ( [ quad ] ) on @xmath74 at all allows a real solution . solving ( [ quad ] )",
    "we get @xmath75 the reality condition is thus @xmath76 that this condition is satisfied in general can be established explicitly if we substitute for @xmath68 from equation ( [ a1 ] ) which gives @xmath77 since from physical consideration the interaction potential is required to be real the above observation indicates the consistency of our formalism .    in the next section we will utilize the solution ( [ v ] ) to express the geneic potential as a function of time employing the phantom power law .",
    "this is the point of departure of our work from the existing works with the gc model available in the literature .",
    "this , as has been explained in the above , suits our purpose of showing that inclusion of a potential widens the allowed range of kinetic energy of the gc model to realise the phantom regime .",
    "needless to say it is imparetive to varify that the criteria identified above are consistent with the dynamical evolution .",
    "in this section we will verify the validity of the criteria ( [ cond_1 ] , [ cond_2 ] ) in the phantom evolution scenario . assuming a phantom power law the time evolutions of both the potential and kinetic energies will be studied . to get explicit time variations of these quantities we require the values of various parameters appearing therein .",
    "these parameters include the phantom power law exponent , the big rip time as well as the present values of energy density etc .",
    "we use the combined wmap7+bao+hubble as well as wmap7 data @xcite as standard data set @xcite .",
    "also in our model there is a free parameter @xmath7 , the value of which will be estimated self - consistently using the same ovservational data",
    ".      we will now find explicit expressions of the potential and kinetic energies as functions of time .",
    "the potential is already given by equation ( [ v ] ) .",
