    "many authors have studied ground - state properties of quantum antiferromagnets , e.g. , the heisenberg and _ xxz _ models , on a triangular lattice . the hamiltonian of the _ xxz _ antiferromagnet is given by @xmath1 where the summation runs over all the nearest - neighbour pairs .",
    "most of the studies are based on one of the following two viewpoints .",
    "the first one is that the system is disordered .",
    "anderson proposed the rvb state@xmath2 , and kalmeyer and laughlin discussed a spin - liquid state@xmath3 from this aspect .",
    "the second one is that the system has a long - range order with the so - called @xmath4 structure , though quantum fluctuations reduce the sublattice magnetization .",
    "trial wave functions which have the @xmath4 structure are discussed by miyashita@xmath5 , and by huse and elser@xmath6 .",
    "the spin - wave expansions@xmath7 and the series expansion@xmath8 suggested the existence of a long - range order .",
    "the present author and suzuki@xmath9 presented the exact ground states of the _ xxz _ model with @xmath10 , most of which have the @xmath4 structures .",
    "we also studied the _",
    "antiferromagnet in the region @xmath11 using the spin - wave expansion and showed that the quantum fluctuations are enhanced , as @xmath12 becomes large . the quantum effect is strong in the heisenberg model .",
    "the estimates of the ground - state energy in the studies based on these pictures are almost equal to each other in the heisenberg model .",
    "thus it is difficult to judge which picture is correct .",
    "apart from the above arguments , several authors@xmath13 studied ground states in finite systems using the exact - diagonalization method .",
    "there are two papers@xmath14 which reported the calculations up to @xmath15 .",
    "conclusions do not coincide with each other .",
    "bernu , lhuillier and pierre@xmath16 reported that the sublattice order is almost equal to that obtained by the spin - wave expansion .",
    "leung and runge s result@xmath17 is , however , contradictory to the existence of the sublattice order .",
    "these two groups fit the data in different ways .",
    "understanding of symmetry breaking has progressed by studies of low - lying excited states . in quantum antiferromagnets the ground state of a finite system is , in many cases , unique and symmetric . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", symmetry is broken by making a linear combination of the ground state and low - lying excited states .",
    "horsch and von der linden@xmath18 first showed that , if the heisenberg antiferromagnet has a nel order , there exists a low - lying excited state whose energy converges to that of the ground state .",
    "koma and tasaki@xmath19 rigorously proved that , if the system has a long - range order , low - lying states of growing numbers converge to the ground state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "several numerical calculations showed the existence of these low - lying excited states in the spin @xmath20 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice@xmath21 and on a triangular lattice@xmath16 .",
    "bernu _ et al._@xmath16 determined the quantum numbers of low - lying states which construct the ordered infinite - volume ground states in the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice .",
    "they studied finite systems and found the existence of a whole set of low - lying states .",
    "et al._@xmath22 studied the finite - size dependence of these low - lying states .",
    "they found that these states satisfy the scaling property which indicates the existence of a long - range order .",
    "in this paper we consider the _ xy _ and heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice .",
    "we study low - lying states to clarify whether spontaneous symmetry - breaking occurs at @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we give approximate forms of low - lying states , in which the degrees of freedom of the sublattice magnetization and the chirality are separated .",
    "we show that the low - lying states can be accurately described with the present approximation . with help of our approximation",
    "we discuss how rearrangements of the low - lying states bring on symmetry breaking . in quantum antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice ,",
    "there are two types of symmetry breaking ; in the heisenberg antiferromagnet both the sublattice magnetization and the chirality relate to the breaking of the @xmath23(3 ) symmetry and in the _ xy _ antiferromagnet the @xmath23(2)@xmath24(chiral ) symmetry can be broken .",
    "these symmetry breakings relate to each other . using our approximation we can understand breakdown of each symmetry independently .",
    "furthermore , studying the low - lying states of finite systems with the numerical diagonalization method , we obtain an evidence of occurrence of the symmetry breaking . in the _ xy _ model the necessary conditions for the symmetry to break are fully satisfied .",
    "we conclude that there exists long - range order in the thermodynamic limit . in the heisenberg model , since the system size studied here is too small , we can not still obtain a definite conclusion about the existence of long - range order , but there are many evidences which support the existence of the long - range order , as discussed in refs . @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    the relation between the long - range order parameter @xmath27 and the spontaneous sublattice magnetization @xmath28 is also argued , though this is not the main part of the present paper .",
    "it has been discussed@xmath29 that , for bipartite systems , the relation is given by @xmath30 in the heisenberg antiferromagnet and by @xmath31 in the _ xy _ antiferromagnet .",
    "in the antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice , however , the factor of the relation becomes @xmath32 times as large as the above .",
    "we obtain @xmath33 for the heisenberg model and @xmath34 for the _ xy _ model .",
    "contents of this paper are the following .",
    "approximate low - lying states are formally given and properties of these states are discussed in section  [ sec2 ] . some results for the low - lying states of ferromagnets , which are used in section  [ sec2 ] to discuss the properties of the approximation , are shown in appendix a. the mechanism of symmetry breaking is discussed in section  [ sec : sb_mechanism ] . in section  [ sec : evidence ]",
    "we show an evidence of the symmetry breaking studying finite systems numerically .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] contains summary and discussions .",
    "the relations between the symmetry breaking and the long - range order parameter are discussed in appendix b.",
    "we study properties of the low - lying states of the quantum antiferromagnets on a finite - volume triangular lattice , using approximate states . in antiferromagnets on finite systems",
    "the ground state is symmetric .",
    "symmetry breaking in an infinite - volume limit is discussed in the next section .",
    "we consider the quantum _ xxz _ antiferromagnets on the finite - volume lattice @xmath35 with a periodic boundary condition .",
    "the size of the system is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 with an integer @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath38 where the summation runs over all the nearest - neighbor sites and the symbol @xmath12 denotes the anisotropy of the @xmath39-component interactions .",

    "we concentrate on low - lying states which have sublattice - translational invariance and @xmath41-invariance .",
    "( we denote the point group of the @xmath4 rotation and reflection of the lattice as @xmath41 . ) bernu _ et al._@xmath16 reported that there are many low - lying states of this type . here",
    "we classify the states according to eigenvalues of the @xmath42 rotation ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we call the class of @xmath43-symmetric states as the type @xmath44 and the class of @xmath43-antisymmetric states as the type @xmath45 .    as an approximation for the lowest states of the type @xmath44 and of the type @xmath45 in the @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 )",
    "subspace , we consider the following states : @xmath48 for @xmath49 , where the symbol @xmath50 denotes the unitary operator @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the state @xmath53 denotes the lowest state in the @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 subspace of the `` ferromagnetic '' _ xxz _ model on @xmath35 which is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath56 here the parameter @xmath12 is set equal to that in ( [ hamiltonian_xxz ] ) .",
    "we denote the eigenvalue of @xmath57 for the state @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "we first discuss the properties of the above approximate states ( [ st_approx ] ) .",
    "after that we verify that this approximation is good .    here",
    "we discuss the meaning of the referred model ( [ hamiltonian_appro ] ) .",
    "the states @xmath60 and @xmath61 are linear combinations of @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the unitary operator @xmath50 transforms the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_xxz ] ) into the form @xmath64 here the symbol @xmath65 goes from the sublattice a to b , b to c , and c to a. the first term in ( [ hamiltonian_uhu ] ) gives the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_appro ] ) .",
    "thus the present approximation corresponds to neglecting the second term in ( [ hamiltonian_uhu ] ) .    in the thermodynamic limit of the ferromagnet ( [ hamiltonian_appro ] ) , only @xmath23(2 )",
    "symmetry breaking can take place , since it has no frustration .",
    "the classical limit of the ferromagnet ( [ hamiltonian_appro ] ) in the region @xmath66 has ferromagnetically ordered ground states , in which all spins are lying in the @xmath67 plane@xmath68 .",
    "the spin @xmath20 ferromagnetic @xmath67 model ( @xmath69 ) on the triangular lattice has been studied by using the exact - diagonalization method@xmath70 and the spin - wave theory@xmath71 .",
    "the results indicate the existence of the ferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "as @xmath12 increases in the ferromagnet ( [ hamiltonian_appro ] ) , quantum fluctuations are enhanced and the magnetization is reduced .",
    "as shown in appendix a , several exact results can be obtained for the ferromagnet ( [ hamiltonian_appro ] ) on the finite - volume lattice @xmath35 .",
    "the ground state is unique and it exists in the @xmath72 subspace .",
    "then it has @xmath23(2)-rotational invariance .",
    "( when @xmath36 is an odd number , there exists trivial degeneracy ; the states @xmath73 and @xmath74 are degenerate . )",
    "the lowest state in the @xmath54 subspace , which we denote as @xmath75 , is unique .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath76 in the basis which are eigenstates of @xmath77  @xmath78  @xmath79 are nonnegative .",
    "all states @xmath77  @xmath80  @xmath79 are translationally invariant and @xmath81-invariant .",
    "( see appendix a. )    using these rigorous results for the low - lying states of the ferromagnet , we can determine the spatial quantum numbers of the approximate states .",
    "we have verified in the small clusters that the spatial quantum numbers of the approximate states ( [ st_approx ] ) are the same as those of the true states .",
    "et al._@xmath16 investigated the spatial quantum numbers of the low - lying states for the heisenberg antiferromagnet and classified the low - lying states into three classes ; @xmath82(states with @xmath83 and even under inversion ) , @xmath84(states with @xmath83 and odd under inversion ) and @xmath85(states with @xmath86 ) .",
    "when @xmath87 or @xmath88 with an integer @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 belong to @xmath82 and @xmath84 , respectively . otherwise , both @xmath90 and @xmath91 belong to @xmath85 . as we show in the next section ,",
    "our classification is useful in discussing the symmetry breaking about the sublattice magnetization and the chirality separately .",
    "we now discuss accuracy of our approximation .",
    "we compare the approximate low - lying states with the true ones , numerically diagonalizing finite systems .",
    "first we note that , as we have already mentioned above , the spatial quantum numbers of our approximate low - lying states are equal to those of the true states : they are invariant under any sublattice translation and any translation of @xmath41 , and they have the same momentum as the true states . in the true system there exist low - lying states of two types corresponding to the types @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "secondly the approximate low - lying states have accurate expectation values of the energy , which are at most @xmath92 higher than the exact values in the _ xy _ model and at most @xmath93 higher in the heisenberg model .",
    "finally we calculated overlaps between the exact low - lying states and the approximate ones .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table : overlap ] . in the _ xy _ model",
    "the approximate states have more than @xmath94 overlaps with the exact states and in the heisenberg model more than @xmath95 .",
    "these situations are the same for the low - lying states in the @xmath96 and @xmath97 subspaces .",
    "thus we find that the exact low - lying spectrum has the two - fold structures , as shown in fig .  1 , and that the true low - lying states can be accurately described with the present approximation .",
    ".overlaps between the ground state @xmath98 and the approximate state @xmath99 , and between the first excited state @xmath100 and the approximate one @xmath101 . [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally we consider the chiral order , which is observed with the operator @xmath102 where the symbol @xmath65 goes from the sublattice a to b , b to c , and c to a. we calculated the long - range order of the chirality @xmath103 .",
    "the values of the spontaneous chirality @xmath104 are estimated using the relations @xmath105 for the heisenberg model and @xmath106 for the _ xy _ model .",
    "we show the results for the _ xy _ model in fig .  6 and for the heisenberg model in fig .",
    "7 . for the _ xy _ model we extrapolated the expectation values of the chirality in the @xmath107 form , which we derive from the finite - size correction of the spin - wave theory@xmath9",
    "on the other hand , in the heisenberg model the finite - size correction behaves in the @xmath108 form , as discussed by azaria _",
    "et al_.@xmath22 this difference of the correction terms comes from the fact that in the heisenberg model the chirality is sensitive to spin - wave fluctuations of long wave - length , while in the _ xy _ model the chiral order is stable against them .",
    "the extrapolated values are shown in tables  [ table : xy ] and  [ table : h ] . in the _ xy _ model",
    "the values are consistent with each other and nonvanishing , which suggests the existence of the chiral order .",
    "thus the condition  ( 4 ) is satisfied . in the heisenberg model",
    "the values do not agree with each other .",
    "it is necessary to calculate larger systems to conclude that these low - lying states have the same chirality .",
    "we can not fit the data to a form including higher - order terms , since the size of the data is too small .",
    "thus we can not still conclude the existence of the long - range order of the chirality in the heisenberg model .    to test the mechanism of symmetry - breaking of the chirality",
    "which we have discussed in section  [ sec : sb_mechanism ] , we construct the following state @xmath109 where @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) denotes the lowest state of the type @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) of each @xmath112 subspace .",
    "we observe the spontaneous chirality of this state .",
    "the expectation value of the chirality is calculated through the relation @xmath113 the estimates in the _ xy _ model are shown in fig .",
    "they are almost equal to the values which are shown in fig .",
    "this coincidence suggests correctness of the mechanism of the chiral symmetry breaking which was discussed in section  [ sec : sb_mechanism ] . in the heisenberg model",
    "we multiply the factor @xmath114 to the calculated values , since the symmetry is not fully broken in the state  ( [ state : sb_ch ] ) ; the state  ( [ state_appro2h ] ) should be properly used instead of ( [ state : sb_ch ] ) .",
    "the estimates are shown in fig .",
    "thus we can break the chiral symmetry by making a linear combination of low - lying states of the type @xmath44 and of the type @xmath45 .    from the above results we summarize that the necessary conditions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are satisfied in the _ xy _ model . in the heisenberg model",
    "the necessary conditions are almost satisfied , though there still remains ambiguity in the point that the low - lying states have the same properties . in any case , in the above results there is no evidence which contradicts the occurrence of symmetry breaking .",
    "to summarize , we studied the low - lying states of quantum antiferromagnets on a triangular lattice to clarify what kind of roles they play in the symmetry breaking and to show an evidence of occurrence of the symmetry breaking .",
    "we gave approximate forms of low - lying states , which have two - fold structures .",
    "it was found that these approximate states resemble the true states in various properties .",
    "we classified the low - lying states by the eigenvalues of @xmath43 , namely @xmath43-symmetric and @xmath43-antisymmetric .",
    "states of both types exist in pairs in the true low - lying spectrum .",
    "we discussed how rearrangements of the low - lying states of two types bring on the symmetry breaking .",
    "the spontaneous chirality is created by taking a linear combination of pairs of low - lying state of the type @xmath44 and of @xmath45 .",
    "the spontaneous sublattice magnetization is obtained by making a linear combination of low - lying states of the same type .    to display an evidence of the occurrence of symmetry breaking , we studied low - lying states of finite systems using the exact - diagonalization method .",
    "we studied whether the necessary conditions of the symmetry breaking are satisfied or not .",
    "we found that the conditions are satisfied in the _ xy _ antiferromagnet .",
    "the estimate of the sublattice magnetization is @xmath115 and of chirality is @xmath116 .",
    "these values are less than the spin - wave results by @xmath93 and @xmath117 respectively . in the heisenberg antiferromagnet",
    "the conditions are almost satisfied , although the estimates of the sublattice magnetization and the chirality do not converge well for lack of the system - size .",
    "the sublattice magnetization is estimated as @xmath118 and the chirality is @xmath119 , where the results from the spin - wave expansion are @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "since the extrapolated results seriously depend on fitting forms , it is still hard in the present study to conclude definitely the existence of the long - range order in the heisenberg model .",
    "we show the uniqueness of the ground state and give spatial quantum numbers of the low - lying states of the spin @xmath122 @xmath123 ferromagnet on finite systems .",
    "we discuss the model on the finite - volume triangular lattice @xmath35 with a periodic boundary condition . for simplicity , we restrict the number of sites to an even integer .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the summation runs over all the nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_ferro ] ) has nonpositive off - diagonal elements .",
    "the basis which have the same @xmath112 are connected by the elements of the hamiltonian . from the perron - frobenius theorem ,",
    "the lowest eigenstate in each @xmath112 subspace is unique and it has nonnegative coefficients .",
    "here we show that the ground state exists uniquely in the @xmath127 subspace .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath128 where @xmath129 for all @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "affleck and lieb@xmath132 showed that , in the antiferromagnetic @xmath123 chain , the ground state exists uniquely in the @xmath127 subspace .",
    "as they did , we transform the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_general ] ) using the unitary operator @xmath133 into the form @xmath134 in the region @xmath135 , this transformed hamiltonian has nonpositive off - diagonal elements .",
    "it has two connected blocks , i.e. all basis in the subspaces with even @xmath112 are connected by the elements of the hamiltonian and those with odd @xmath112 are connected . from the perron - frobenius theorem ,",
    "the lowest eigenstate in each connected subspace is unique .",
    "thus we find that the number of the ground states is at most two in the original model ( [ hamiltonian_general ] ) .",
    "the lowest states in the @xmath54 and @xmath136 subspaces are degenerate .",
    "when level crossing of the ground state occurs , more than two ground states must exist , which contradicts the above result .",
    "thus in the whole region of various parameters @xmath77  @xmath137  @xmath79 , the ground state should exist in the same @xmath112 subspace .    for the region @xmath138 ,",
    "as affleck and lieb did , the above results can be shown using the unitary operator @xmath139    to obtain the eigenvalue @xmath112 of the ground state , we consider the case @xmath140 for all @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath144 .",
    "the ground state of this model is unique and it has the eigenvalues @xmath145 and @xmath127.@xmath146 from the above results , we find that the ground state of the original model ( [ hamiltonian_ferro ] ) in the regions @xmath147 and @xmath135 exists uniquely in the @xmath127 subspace .    this argument can be extended to the ferromagnetic @xmath123 model on any lattice .",
    "the ferromagnet on a bipartite lattice is equivalent to the @xmath123 antiferromagnet with the @xmath39-component anisotropy @xmath148 . in this case",
    "the above results are consistent with what were proved by lieb and mattis@xmath149 , and affleck and lieb@xmath132 .",
    "lastly , we give the spatial quantum numbers of the lowest state in each @xmath112 subspace . the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_ferro ] ) is invariant under any translation , rotation , and reflection . as we have shown in the above",
    ", the lowest state is nondegenerate and it has nonnegative coefficients .",
    "from this fact , we find that the lowest state has the eigenvalue @xmath150 for any translation , rotation , and reflection , i.e. it is translationally invariant and @xmath81-invariant .",
    "we discuss the relation between spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath28 and the long - range order parameter @xmath27 .",
    "it has been discussed@xmath151 that the relation is given by @xmath30 for the heisenberg antiferromagnet and by @xmath152 for the @xmath67 antiferromagnet on bipartite lattices .",
    "but these relations are not valid in the antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice . here",
    "we show that , in the antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice , the factor becomes @xmath153 times as large as the above .",
    "our arguments are based on the assumption that the symmetric infinite - volume ground state , ( [ def : mixed_state ] ) , is decomposed into the pure ground states .",
