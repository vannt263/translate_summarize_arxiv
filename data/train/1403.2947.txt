    "since its discovery in 2004 @xcite , graphene continues to be the subject of intense interest regarding its exotic properties @xcite .",
    "these intriguing properties , such as the anomalous quantum hall effect , are ascribed to dirac type electrons described by the weyl s equation for massless particles @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties in graphene are significantly affected by applying a strain @xcite .",
    "the latter can also , accidentally , occur during the fabrication process as in exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition of graphene samples @xcite .",
    "theoretical and first principle calculations revealed the substantial effect of the strain on the electronic and lattice spectra of graphene @xcite . to bring out the signature of strain induced modified electronic and vibrational properties , raman spectroscopy has emerged as a powerfull probe .",
    "this technique , which is simple to use in graphene , is found to be a successful tool to identify the number of layers in multilayer graphene , to probe the nature of disorder and the doping amount @xcite .",
    "several experimental studies have been carried out on raman spectra of graphene under uniaxial strain @xcite .",
    "the results revealed that , due to the strain , the raman g band is redshifted and splitted into two peaks denoted g@xmath1 and g@xmath2 .",
    "g@xmath1 ( g@xmath2 ) is the mode polarized perpendicular ( along ) the strain direction .",
    "the g peak appearing in unstrained graphene at 1580 @xmath3 corresponds to a doubly degenerate optical mode at the @xmath0 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the splitting of the g peak results from the strain induced lattice symmetry lowering .",
    "experimental results showed that the frequency shift rates of the g@xmath1 and g@xmath2 as a function of the strain strength @xmath4 is of @xmath5 -13 @xmath6 and @xmath7 -6 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent measurements @xcite reported that the rate shifts of g@xmath2 and @xmath8 are respectively of -33 @xmath6 and -14 @xmath6 in agreement with first principle calculations @xcite .",
    "the difference in the shift rates was attributed to strain calibration @xcite .",
    "the g band splitting could be understood within a phenomenological model based on a semiclassical approach @xcite . within this model , the shear component of the strain",
    "is found to be responsable of the splitting .",
    "raman spectroscopy of strained graphene has also revealed that the 2d band , originating from a resonant scattering process involving two optical phonons at the bz edges , splits into two peaks under uniaxial strain @xcite .",
    "this splitting was ascribed to strain induced changes in the resonant conditions resulting from both modified electronic band structure and phonon dispersion @xcite .",
    "several studies reported that the electron - phonon coupling plays a key role in raman spectroscopy in graphene @xcite .",
    "ando @xcite showed that , in undeformed graphene , the frequency of the center zone optical phonon mode is shifted due to electron - phonon interaction . the frequency behavior is found to depend on the value of the fermi energy @xmath9 compared to the phonon frequency @xmath10 at the @xmath0 point : for @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , the phonon frequency is redshifted ( blueshifted ) leading to a lattice softening ( hardening ) . in the clean limit , a logarithmic singularity takes place at @xmath13 which is found to be smeared out in the dirty limit and at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , ando@xcite reported an anomalous behavior of the optical phonon damping induced by the electron - phonon interaction : for @xmath14 , the phonons are damped due to the formation of electron - hole pairs leading to phonon softening @xcite . however , for @xmath15 , the phonon is no more damped since the electron - hole pair production is forbidden by pauli principle @xcite .",
    "this damping behavior predicted by ando @xcite was observed in raman spectroscopy @xcite . the natural question , which arises at this point , is how the frequency shifts and damping of optical phonon are modified in uniaxial strained graphene where electron band structure is deeply changed .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite showed that the perfect honeycomb lattice of graphene undergoes a quinoid - type deformation by applying a uniaxial strain .",
    "the dirac cones are no longer at the corners of the bz and are tilted .",
    "the corresponding low energy electronic properties could be described by the generalized tow dimensional ( 2d ) weyl s hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the tilted dirac cones are also expected in the organic conductor @xmath16-(bedt)@xmath17i@xmath18 where bedt stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene @xcite.based on the generalized weyl s hamiltonian , several intriguing properties of this compound have been unveiled @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the effect of the electron - phonon interaction on the @xmath0 point optical phonon modes in graphene under uniaxial strain described by a quinoid - type lattice . we show that the frequency shift and the broadening of the longitudinal optical ( lo ) and the transverse optical ( to ) phonon modes are substantially dependent on the characteristic parameters of the weyl hamiltonian which are the tilt and the anisotropy of the electronic dispersion relation .",
    "we bring out original points which , to the best of our knowledge , have not been addressed so far : ( i ) the electron - phonon interaction in strained graphene induces a lifting of the degeneracy of the lo and to modes which contributes to the splitting of the g band .",
    "this effect is found to originate from the anisotropy of the electronic spectrum and not from the tilt of dirac cones .",
    "the latter may only give rise to a global shift of the g band compared to the undeformed case .",
    "the splitting is found to be strongly dependent on the electron density and disorder amount .",
    "( ii ) the anomalous behavior of the phonon damping reported in refs.@xcite in undeformed graphene is found to be a robust feature which is kept under uniaxial strain .",
    "the damping of lo and to modes strongly depends on the strain amplitude and the phonon angle .",
    "we found that , in the particular case , where one of the mode is along the strain direction , the corresponding phonons are strongly damped for a compressive deformation .",
    "however the phonon mode perpendicular to the strain direction is less damped and its lifetime increases as the strain amplitude increases . for tensile deformation",
    "the mode behaviors are exchanged .",
    "( iii ) a crossing of to and lo frequencies can take place at a particular doping values as found in carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "( iv ) we found that the electron - phonon interaction contributes to the polarization dependence of the g peak in uniaxial strained graphene as concluded by mohiuddin _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we give the outlines of the formulation to derive the optical phonon self - energy .",
    "we start with the generalized weyl s hamiltonian obtained within the effective mass approach .",
    "then , we derive the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian and the phonon self - energy . the results are discussed in sec .",
    "iii in relation with experiments .",
    "iv is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the optical phonon modes of the center bz responsable of the g peak in graphene .",
    "we focus on the lo and inplane to modes .",
    "we first derive the electronic hamiltonian , within the effective mass theory @xcite , taking into account the first and second neighbor hopping parameters in strained graphene .      by applying a uniaxial strain along , for example , the @xmath19 direction",
    "the honeycomb lattice turns to a quinoid type lattice @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that one should consider an arbitrary strain direction as done for example in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , several experimental and numerical studies @xcite have shown that the g band behavior is independent of the strain direction . considering a generic strain direction will give rise to the same form of the electronic hamiltonian but with renormalized parameters .",
    "we , then , consider for simplicity a strain along the @xmath19 direction as in ref.@xcite .",
