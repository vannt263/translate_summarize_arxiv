    "these radiative transfer calculations illustrate clearly that ly@xmath0 radiation pressure may be important in driving outflows in various environments .",
    "importantly , the pressure exerted by ly@xmath0 radiation alone can exceed the maximum possible pressure exerted by continuum radiation through dust opacity ( see paper i ) , which in turn can exceed the total kinetic pressure exerted by supernova ejecta @xcite .",

    "the latter depends on various factors , including the column density of neutral hydrogen atoms in the shell , the intrinsic ly@xmath0 spectrum ( i.e. the emitted spectrum _ prior _ to scattering in the shell ) , as well as the shell velocity .",
    "for example , as @xmath15 increases , atoms in the shell interact with ly@xmath0 photons that are farther in the wing of the line profile , and @xmath45 diminishes .",
    "[ eq : diff ] assumes that the hi shell mass remains constant in time .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the observation that supershells are well defined shells of hi gas that are physically separate from the central ly@xmath0 source .",
    "these outflows differ from steady - state outflows ( i.e. outflows in which mass is ejected at a constant rate @xmath46 ) that occur around late - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in reality , an hi supershell is not likely to maintain a constant mass as it sweeps through the ism , but its evolution depends on the detailed hydrodynamics of the shell as it propagates through the ism , which in turn depends on the assumed properties of the ism . in this first study",
    ", we focus on simplified models that gauge the general importance of ly@xmath0 radiation pressure on the dynamics of galactic supershells .",
    "furthermore , our calculation of the parameter @xmath45 conservatively ignores that possibility of trapped ly@xmath0 photons by the expanding supershell , which can boost the radiation pressure considerably .",
    "if radiation trapping were included , then the parameter @xmath45 would equal the force - multiplier @xmath47 , which was shown to be much greater than unity at low @xmath48 in paper i ( see   [ sec : conc ] for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we adopt a conservative approach because the calculation of @xmath47 in paper i assumed that the expanding shell contained no dust . under realistic circumstances , the existence of dust inside the supershell will suppress the number of times the ly@xmath0 photons can bounce back and forth between opposite sites of the shell , which leads to a reduction in the value of @xmath47 .",
    "however , provided that the dust is located inside ( or exterior to ) the hi shell , the true value of @xmath47 is always larger than the @xmath45 adopted in the paper ( see   [ sec : conc ] ) .",
    "we compute @xmath44 under the conventional set of assumptions : ( _ i _ ) the emitted ly@xmath0 spectrum prior to scattering is assumed to be a gaussian with a velocity width @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is the circular virial velocity of the host dark matter halo ; and ( _ ii _ ) the outflow is modeled as _ a single expanding thin shell of gas _ with a column density @xmath14 ( as in * ? ? ?",

    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fw ] , @xmath45 increases with increasing @xmath14 , because photons need to be farther in the wing of the line profile ( in the frame of the shell ) for them not to scatter .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : fw ] shows that @xmath64 of the ly@xmath0 photons are scattered when the shell speed is @xmath65 km s@xmath3 for @xmath66 @xmath22 , whereas the same fraction is reached when the shell speed is @xmath67 ( 2000 ) km s@xmath3 for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) @xmath22 .",

    "can be ruled out : our predicted @xmath12 for fdf 4691 exceeds the size of the largest observed ly@xmath0 emitting structure in our universe , which is @xmath184 kpc in diameter @xcite .",

    "lastly , we predict a radius @xmath186 kpc for fdf 7531 .",
    "our model therefore predicts that existing observations should have resolved this galaxy as a spatially extended ly@xmath0 source ( which is not observed ) .    for most other galaxies , @xmath187@xmath7 kpc , @xmath188@xmath103 myr , and @xmath189@xmath11 ergs . for comparison ,",

    "our largest shells are larger than those of supershells that were observed in our galaxy , but are comparable in size of the inferred sizes of hi outflows around local star burst galaxies ( mass - hesse et al .",
    "thus , there is considerable overlap in the physical properties of observed ( extra)galactic supershells and those in our model , although our model does contain a few supershells that are significantly larger and more energetic than observed galactic supershells",
    ". this may be because we ignore gravity .",
    "indeed , for these energetic shells ( @xmath196 a few @xmath146 erg ) , the maximum shell speed does not exceed the escape velocity of the host dark matter halo , and so gravity can not be ignored .",
    "we caution that the escape velocity of the dark matter halo that we computed are approximate .",
    "our escape velocity was derived using the relation @xmath197}$ ] , which assumes that the shell climbs out of the gravitational potential of an isothermal sphere .",
    "although our calculated @xmath139 depends only weakly on @xmath198 , we caution that deviations from our assumed simple model may change the results somewhat .",
    "interestingly , the fudge factor @xmath151 is within the range @xmath199@xmath200 in all models .",
    "the small scatter in @xmath151 arises because all shells initially have much higher hi column densities than their observed values .",
    "therefore , for all shells the parameter @xmath156 during the early stages of their evolution .",
    "depending on the precise time evolution of column density and shell speed , @xmath45 eventually drops below unity ( for some galaxies this has not happened yet and @xmath156 , which in turn implies @xmath155 ) .",
    "additional scatter may arise from the fact that some shells have predicted size that are close to the initial shell size assumed for our models .",
    "the small scatter in @xmath151 implies that one can predict physical properties of galactic supershells without numerically integrating equation  ( [ eq : diff2 ] ) . instead",

    "it is well known that scattering of ly@xmath0 photons by neutral hydrogen in a single outflowing supershell around star - forming galaxies can naturally explain two observed phenomena : ( _ i _ ) the common shift of the ly@xmath0 emission line towards the red relative to other nebular recombination and metal absorption lines , and ( _ ii _ ) the asymmetry of the ly@xmath0 line with emission extending well into its red wing . in this paper we have computed the radiation pressure that is exerted by this scattered ly@xmath0 radiation on the outflowing shell .",
    "we have shown that for reasonable shell parameters the shell can be accelerated to a few hundred km s@xmath3 after @xmath203 myr .",
    "the ly@xmath0 acceleration mechanism becomes increasingly inefficient as the shell speed increases ( fig .",

    "we predict supershell radii that lie in the range @xmath6@xmath7 kpc , ages in the range @xmath208@xmath9 myr , and energies in the range @xmath10@xmath11 ergs , in broad agreement with the properties of local galactic supershells .",
    "we derive mass outflow rates in the supershells that reach @xmath17@xmath18 of the star formation rates in the host galaxies , in agreement with the _ total _ outflow rates that one expects theoretically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have found that in all models the radius of the supershell is determined uniquely by parameters such as the _ intrinsic _ ly@xmath0 luminosity of the host galaxy ( which may be inferred from the observed ly@xmath0 line shape ) , @xmath13 , the total column density of hi in the supershell , @xmath14 , and the shell velocity @xmath15 , @xmath209 here @xmath151 is a fudge factor that lies in the range @xmath210@xmath211 .",
    "our models have ignored gravity and the pressure of exerted by the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "_ this relation holds up only for supershells that are driven predominantly by ly@xmath0 radiation pressure_. this relation is most accurate for those galaxies in which the shells are accelerated to velocities that exceed @xmath139 .",
    "we found this to be the case in 5 out of 9 ( 55% , see table  [ table : predict ] , ignoring the galaxies for which our model was ruled out , i.e. fdf 1267b , fdf 5215 , fdf4691 , and fdf 7539 ) of known galaxies .",
    "hence , these shells could contribute to the enrichment of the intergalactic medium .",
    "in other cases , gravity ( and external pressure ) will tend to reduce the value of the fudge factor @xmath151 . also , if neutral hydrogen gas only makes up a fraction @xmath212 of the total mass of the shell ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) , then our predicted value of @xmath12 should be lowered by a factor of @xmath212 .    on the other hand , as was already mentioned in   [ sec : result ] , our conservative calculations have completely ignored the fact that trapping of ly@xmath0 radiation by the optically thick supershell may significantly boost the ly@xmath0 radiation pressure compared to what was used in this paper .",
    "specifically , it was shown in paper i that when this trapping is properly accounted for , the total radiation force in eq .",
    "[ eq : diff ] should include @xmath213 in place of @xmath44 . here",
    ", @xmath47 is force - multiplication factor that was introduced by @xcite , as @xmath214 . here",
    ", @xmath215 is the total force that radiation exerts on a medium , @xmath216 is the total optical depth to electron scattering through this medium .",
    "the function @xmath217 arises because of the contribution of numerous metal absorption lines to the medium s opacity , and can be as large as @xmath218 in the atmospheres of o - stars @xcite . ] that depends both the column density of hi and the velocity of the supershell . in paper",
    "i , @xmath47 was computed for a range of @xmath14 and @xmath48 values , by performing monte - carlo ly@xmath0 radiative transfer calculation for each combination of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in these calculations",
    ", the hi shell surrounds an empty cavity .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fscat ] . as evident from the plot , @xmath47 greatly exceeds unity for low shell velocities and large hi column densities .",
    "overplotted as the _ grey line _ is the trajectory in the @xmath219 plane of the supershell in cb-58 (   [ sec : cb-58 ] ) . at early times , @xmath220 , and",
    "we may have underestimated the radiation pressure force significantly ( as was mentioned in   [ sec : result ] , the actual force multiplication factor may be less than @xmath47 , if gas and dust interior to the supershell prevents photons from repeatedly bouncing back an forth between opposite sides of the hi shell ) .",
    "ly@xmath0 trapping could boost our predicted value of @xmath12 by a factor as large as @xmath221 , where @xmath221 the value of @xmath47 , averaged over the expansion history of the shell .",
    "so far , we have assumed hi to be the only source of opacity in the supershell .",
    "however , supershells may also contain dust which provides an additional source of opacity ; for example , in the models of verhamme et al ( 2008 ) , the optical depth through dust at @xmath222 is @xmath223@xmath224 . at a given hi column density ,",
    "we have therefore systematically underestimated @xmath45 , ( absorption of a ly@xmath0 photon by dust also results in a momentum transfer of magnitude @xmath225 ) , which renders our calculations conservative .",
    "furthermore , dusty supershells could also absorb significant amounts of continuum radiation , boosting the total momentum transfer rate even further .",
    "if the dust resides interior to the hi shell , then the ly@xmath0 flux that impinges upon the shell is reduced by e@xmath226 . in this case , the ly@xmath0 ( as well as the continuum ) radiation pressure is smaller than computed in this paper . however , the coupling between gas and dust makes it very unlikely that ( ly@xmath0 ) radiation pressure sweeps up the gas surrounding a star forming region , while keeping the dust in place ( see * ? ? ? * for more discussion on this ) .",
    "of course , the existence of dust inside the hi shell reduces its ability to trap ly@xmath0 photons , which reduces the value of @xmath47 compared to that shown in figure  [ fig : fscat ] .",
    "despite this reduction , @xmath47 can still greatly exceed unity , because at low shell expansion velocities the majority of ly@xmath0 photons do no penetrate deeply into the hi shell upon their first entry .",
    "instead , the photons mostly scatter near the surface of the shell , and only see a fraction of the dust opacity ( indeed , for this reason ly@xmath0 radiation can escape from a dusty two - phased ism , see neufeld 1991 and hansen & oh 2006 ) . in other words , a relative small inner portion the hi shell can effectively trap ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "we have verified this statement with monte - carlo radiative transfer calculations that included dust at the levels inferred by @xcite : we typically found @xmath47 to be reduced by a factor of up to a few .",
    "in other words , even for dusty shells it is possible that @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , the pressure exerted by ly@xmath0 radiation alone can exceed the maximum possible pressure exerted by continuum radiation ( also see paper i ) , which can drive the large gas masses ( as large as a few @xmath228 ) out of galaxies in a galactic _ superwind _ @xcite .",
    "for comparison , in our model the ly@xmath0 photons transfer their momentum onto the expanding supershell , which contains significantly less mass ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "this implies that in principle , both mechanisms could operate simultaneously , and that the neutral hi supershells may be accelerated to higher velocities than the bulk of the ejected gas .",
    "since in our model ly@xmath0 radiation pressure operates only on a fraction of the gas , it does not provide a self - regulating mechanism for star formation and black hole growth as in @xcite .",
    "however , it does provide a new way of enriching the intergalactic medium with metals .",
    "we note that quasars can have ly@xmath0 luminosities luminosity of quasars is related to their b - band luminosity as @xmath230 ( dijkstra & wyithe , 2006 ) .",
    "high - redshift quasars have been observed with @xmath231 erg s@xmath3 ( see e.g figure  1 of dijkstra & wyithe , 2006 ) . ] that reach @xmath232 erg s@xmath3 @xcite . in principle , this ly@xmath0 luminosity could transfer a significant amount of momentum onto neutral gas in its proximity . because the ly@xmath0 emission line of quasars is typically very broad ( @xmath23 few thousand km s@xmath3 )",
    ", @xmath45 is significantly less than unity for the column densities considered in the paper ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fw ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear whether gas clouds can remain neutral in close proximity to the quasar for an extended period of time .",
    "even if this is the case , it remains to be determined whether the ly@xmath0 radiation pressure can compete with the continuum radiation pressure .",
    "the importance of ly@xmath0 radiation pressure near quasars therefore remains an open issue .    to conclude ,",
    "observations indicate that it is the kinematics of hi gas surrounding star forming regions that mostly determines the observed properties of the ly@xmath0 radiation ( as opposed to dust content , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work suggests that -at least in some cases- the pressure exerted by the ly@xmath0 photons themselves may be important in determining the kinematics of hi gas .",
    "this is appealing for two reasons : ( _ i _ ) the mechanism operates irrespective of the dust content of the hi supershells .",
    "this mechanism may therefore operate also in galaxies of primordial composition at high redshift ( especially since the total ly@xmath0 luminosity per unit star formation rate is higher , e.g. schaerer 2003 ) , and ( _ ii _ ) the shape and velocity offset of the observed ly@xmath0 emission strongly suggest that momentum transfer from ly@xmath0 photons to hi gas is actually observed to occur .    *",
