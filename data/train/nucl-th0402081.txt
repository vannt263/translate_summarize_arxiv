    "among the various processes that characterize atomic nuclei , short - range correlations ( src ) play a very important role in the study of nuclear structure .",
    "it is now understood that the repulsive core of the nuclear interaction , at small distances , has a decisive influence on the spectral distribution of nucleons and on the binding properties of both finite and infinite nuclear systems  @xcite .",
    "photo - induced two - nucleon knockout reactions like @xmath7 and @xmath8 appear to be a powerful tool to investigate two - body correlations in nuclei .",
    "indeed , the probability that a real or virtual photon is absorbed by a pair should be a direct measure of the correlation between the two nucleons .",
    "the measurements of these cross sections have only become possible in recent years  @xcite by means of modern electron beam facilities .",
    "studies with a @xmath0o target have been carried out at the amps - facility at nikhef - amsterdam  @xcite and the mami - facility in mainz  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the nikhef data with theoretical calculations  @xcite for the @xmath0o@xmath3 reaction has been carried out in refs .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that the transition to the ground state of @xmath2c is dominated by the presence of src whenever the two protons are emitted back - to - back with small total momenta .",
    "therefore , the high experimental cross section observed for this transition at small missing momenta can be considered a clear signature of src  @xcite .",
    "further measurements have been carried out at the mami - facility in mainz for the @xmath0o@xmath3  @xcite reaction and proposed for the @xmath0o@xmath4 case  @xcite .",
    "the resolution achieved in these new experiments allows the separation of specific excited states in the residual nucleus .",
    "a recent @xmath9 experiment  @xcite performed at jlab also was aimed at the direct observations of high - momentum protons in the nucleus , another clear signature of src .",
    "these measurements are expected to produce new and detailed information on the one - body spectral distribution . however , due to the high missing energies and momenta required to observe this consequence of src , one is forced to work in a kinematic region where the effects of the final - state interaction tend to overwhelm the direct signal  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of two - nucleon emission lies in the possibility of ejecting the correlated pair as a whole , thus seeing the effects of src even at small missing energies and momenta but corresponding to large values of the relative momentum of the pair . on the other hand , several studies  @xcite",
    "suggest that details of the two - nucleon emission cross sections are sensitive not only to src",
    ". indeed long - range correlations ( lrc ) , at low energy , and the reaction mechanism are also important .",
    "moreover , which of these effects is predominant depends on the particular choice of the kinematics and on the final state of the residual nucleus , in particular its angular momentum and parity .",
    "the latter quantities therefore act as a filter for the study of various reaction processes .",
    "clearly , while this richness of details complicates the extraction of information related to src , it also identifies two - nucleon emission reactions as a unique tool to probe different aspects of two - body correlations in finite systems .",
    "the model of the reaction mechanism employed in ref .",
    "@xcite was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the excitation process includes the contribution of the usual one - body terms as well as those two - body currents which involve the intermediate excitation of the @xmath6-isobar . in the present work the improved treatment of the nuclear currents , given in refs .",
    "@xcite will be employed .",
    "the treatment of the final - state interaction accounts for the distorting effect of their interaction with the remaining nucleons in terms of an optical potential . as in previous works",
    ", the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons will be neglected here .",
    "this was argued in the past by noting that the pair of protons will leave the nucleus largely back to back making this type of final - state interaction less important .",
    "however , recent perturbative calculations on the @xmath3 process  @xcite show that this effect can produce a significant increase of the experimental yield .",
    "work is in progress to include these contributions completely  @xcite .",
    "this issue remains beyond the scope of the present investigation and will not be further discussed in the following .",
    "an important element in the calculation of the cross section is the two - body overlap ( or removal ) amplitude , which contains the information on the correlations between the pair of nucleons inside the system .",
    "these amplitudes were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite for two protons by partitioning the full hilbert space to obtain a model space large enough to account for the most relevant lrc .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the effects of src concern high relative momentum states ( at high energy ) and which are sufficiently decoupled from the collective motion at low energy as not to be influenced by it .",
    "the lrc were then obtained by solving the two - hole dressed random phase approximation ( hh - drpa ) inside the model space , while the distortion due to src was included by adding appropriate defect functions , computed for the specifically excluded space . in doing so ,",
    "the non - locality of the pauli operator was neglected , resulting in a set of only few defect functions , essentially independent of the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion of the pair .",
    "the resulting two - nucleon spectral function was then employed in the calculation of the @xmath0o@xmath3 cross section in ref .",
    "a similar approach was followed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0o@xmath4 case also by employing the same model  @xcite of the reaction mechanism . in this work",
    "the two - hole spectral function for a proton - neutron pair was obtained by employing a coupled - cluster approach .",
    "the @xmath10 approximation employed in ref .",
    "@xcite is quite similar to the evaluation of the short - range part of the two - body spectral function in terms of a brueckner @xmath11 matrix , as employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but does not account as well for the effects of lrc .",
    "however , a full set of defect functions , including their dependence on the c.m . of the pair ,",
    "is obtained naturally in this approach .",
    "given the differences between the above calculations , it is interesting to compare the emission of both a pp and a pn pair by evaluating them within the same description of the nuclear structure effects .",
    "furthermore , the description of nuclear structure effects related to the description of the fragmentation of the single - particle strength has been improved by applying a faddeev technique to the description of the internal propagators in the nucleon self - energy  @xcite .",
    "this development provides an additional incentive to study the resulting consequences for the description of two - nucleon removal reactions . in the present work we pursue these aims by employing the hh - drpa approach of refs .",
