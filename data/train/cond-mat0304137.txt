    "in a recent article @xcite(intended for an audience of experimentalists ) , the author has reviewed arguments that many aspects of the physics of the cuprate superconductors can be understood by using their proximity to paramagnetic mott insulators .",
    "further , a distinction was made between mott insulators with collinear and non - collinear spin correlations , and it was argued that current experimental evidence suggests that we need only consider the collinear class .",
    "a phenomenological description of the ground states and excitations of these classes of mott insulators was provided , along with a discussion of their experimental implications .",
    "a more technical discussion ( intended for theorists ) of such insulators , along with a description of the effective field theories which describe their low energy properties appears in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we briefly recall the derivation and properties of the effective field theory of mott insulators with _ collinear _ spin correlations , which is expressed in terms of a compact u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "the non - collinear class leads naturally to a @xmath0 gauge theory , but we will not consider it here . the reader is referred to these previous reviews @xcite for complete citations to the literature .",
    "we focus on mott insulators on a @xmath1 dimensional bipartite lattice of sites @xmath2 .",
    "the su(2 ) spin operator @xmath3 on site @xmath2 at imaginary time @xmath4 can be written as @xmath5 here @xmath6 on the two sublattices , @xmath7 is the spatial co - ordinate of site @xmath2 , @xmath8 is a unit length vector in spin space , and @xmath9 is the ( integer or half - odd - integer ) angular momentum of each spin .",
    "the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between near neighbor spins implies that @xmath10 will be a slowly varying function of its spacetime arguments . a standard analysis of the coherent state path integral of over the su(2 )",
    "@xmath3 spins shows that the low energy quantum fluctuations are described by the following partition function @xmath11 , \\label{zl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the spin - wave velocity , and @xmath13 is a coupling constant which controls the strength of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "excluding the first berry phase term , this is the action of the o(3 ) non - linear sigma model in @xmath14 spacetime dimensions .",
    "here we are primarily interested in the consequences of the berry phases : @xmath15 is defined to be the oriented area of the spherical triangle defined by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and an arbitrary reference point @xmath18 ( which is usually chosen to be the north pole ) .    the theory ( [ zl ] ) can be considered to be the `` minimal model '' of antiferromagnets . in dimensions @xmath19 it has at least two phases : at small @xmath13 there is the conventional magnetically ordered `` nel '' phase with @xmath20 , while at large @xmath13 there is a `` quantum disordered '' paramagnetic phase which preserves spin rotation invariance with @xmath21 .",
    "we are especially interested here in the nature of this paramagnetic state . in this section",
    ", we will manipulate @xmath22 in this large @xmath13 regime , and derive an alternative formulation which allows easier computation of the integral over the berry phases .",
    "the key to an analysis of the large @xmath13 regime is a better understanding of the nature of @xmath23 .",
    "we will see that @xmath23 behaves in many respects like the time - component of a compact u(1 ) gauge field , and indeed , this accounts for the suggestive notation .",
    "all physical results should be independent of the choice of the reference point @xmath18 , and it is easy to see by drawing triangles on the surface of a sphere that changes in @xmath18 amount to gauge transformations of @xmath23 . if we change @xmath18 to @xmath24 , then the resulting @xmath25 is related to @xmath23 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 measures the oriented area of the spherical triangle defined by @xmath28 , @xmath18 , and @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , as we will discuss more completely below , the area of any spherical triangle is uncertain modulo @xmath29 , and this accounts for the ` compactness ' of the u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "we proceed with our analysis of @xmath22 .",
    "first , we discretize the gradient terms of the o(3 ) sigma model",
    ". we will limit our considerations here to antiferromagnets on @xmath1 dimensional cubic lattices , but similar considerations apply to other bipartite lattices .",
    "we also discretize the imaginary time direction , and ( by a slight abuse of notation ) use the same index @xmath2 to refer to the sites of a @xmath14 dimensional cubic lattice in spacetime .",
    "on such a lattice we can rewrite ( [ zl ] ) as @xmath30 where the sum over @xmath31 extends over the @xmath14 spacetime directions .",
    "we have also dropped unimportant factors of the lattice spacing and the spin - wave velocity in ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "as noted above , we are especially interested here in the large @xmath13 regime where there are strong fluctuations of the @xmath32 .",
    "there are strong cancellations from the berry phases between different spin configurations in this regime , and so the second term in @xmath33 has to be treated with great care .",
    "we will do this by promoting the field @xmath34 to an independent degree of freedom , while integrating out the @xmath32 .",
    "notice that we have now introduced all @xmath14 components of the compact u(1 ) gauge field with the index @xmath31 , while only the @xmath35 component appears explicitly in ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the remaining components appear naturally as suitable degrees of freedom when we integrate the @xmath32 out .",
    "formally , the integration over the @xmath32 can be done by introducing new ` dummy ' variables @xmath36 and rewriting ( [ f1 ] ) by introducing factors of unity on each link ; this leads to @xmath37 in the first expression , if the integral over the @xmath36 is performed first , we trivially return to ( [ f1 ] ) ; however , in the second expression we perform the integral over the @xmath32 variables first , at the cost of introducing an unknown effective action @xmath38 for the @xmath36 . in principle ,",
    "evaluation of @xmath38 may be performed order - by - order in a `` high temperature '' expansion in @xmath39 : we match correlators of the @xmath36 flux with those of the @xmath40 flux evaluated in the integral over the @xmath32 with positive weights determined only by the @xmath39 term in ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "rather than undertaking this laborious calculation , we can guess essential features of the effective action @xmath38 from some general constraints .",
    "first , correlations in the @xmath32 decay exponentially rapidly for large @xmath13 ( with a correlation length @xmath41 ) , and so @xmath38 should be local .",
    "second , it should be invariant under the lattice form of the gauge transformation ( [ gauge ] ) @xmath42 associated with the change in the reference point on the unit sphere from @xmath18 to @xmath43 , with @xmath44 equal to the area of the spherical triangle formed by @xmath32 , @xmath18 and @xmath43 .",
    "finally the area of any triangle on the sphere is uncertain modulo @xmath45 and so the effective action should be invariant under @xmath46 the simplest local action which is invariant under ( [ f3 ] ) and ( [ f4 ] ) is that of _ compact u(1 ) quantum electrodynamics _ and so we have @xmath47 for large @xmath13 ; comparison with the large @xmath13 expansion shows that the coupling @xmath48 . in ( [ f5 ] ) , @xmath49 is the discrete lattice derivative along the @xmath31 direction , and the sum over @xmath50 extends over all plaquettes of the @xmath14 dimensional cubic lattice ",
    "both notations are standard in the lattice gauge theory literature .",
    "the first term in the action ( [ f5 ] ) is , of course , the standard ` maxwell ' term of a compact u(1 ) gauge field . in this language",
    ", the berry phase has the interpretation of a @xmath51 coupling to a fixed matter field with ` current ' @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to static matter with charges @xmath53 on the two sublattices .",
    "it is this matter field which will crucially control the nature of the ground state .",
    "the remaining analysis of @xmath33 depends upon the spatial dimensionality @xmath1 . in @xmath54 , a dual model of ( [ f5 ] ) is solvable , and the results are in complete accord with those obtained earlier by bethe ansatz and bosonization analyses of spin chains .",
    "we will consider the @xmath55 case in the section below .",
    "there has been relatively little discussion of the @xmath56 case ( which exhibits both confining and deconfining phases of the gauge theory ) , and this remains an important avenue for future research .",
    "as is standard in duality mappings , we first rewrite the partition function in @xmath57 spacetime dimensions by replacing the cosine interaction in ( [ f5 ] ) by a villain sum over periodic gaussians : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total antisymmetric tensor in three dimensions , and the @xmath60 are integers on the links of the _ dual _ cubic lattice , which pierce the plaquettes of the direct lattice . throughout this subsection",
    "we will use the index @xmath61 to refer to sites of this dual lattice , while @xmath2 refers to the direct lattice on sites on which the spins are located .",
    "we will now perform a series of exact manipulations on ( [ f6 ] ) which will lead to a dual _ interface _ model @xcite .",
    "this dual model has only positive weights  this fact , of course , makes it much more amenable to a standard statistical analysis .",
    "this first step in the duality transformation is to rewrite ( [ f6 ] ) by the poisson summation formula : @xmath62 where @xmath63 ( like @xmath60 ) is an integer - valued vector field on the links of the dual lattice ( here , and below , we drop overall normalization factors in front of the partition function ) .",
    "next , we write the berry phase in a form more amenable to duality transformations . choose a ` background ' @xmath64 flux which satisfies @xmath65 where @xmath2 is the direct lattice site in the center of the plaquette defined by the curl on the left - hand - side .",
    "any integer - valued solution of ( [ d2 ] ) is an acceptable choice for @xmath66 , and a convenient choice is shown in fig  [ fig1 ] .    .",
    "the circles are the sites of the direct lattice , @xmath2 , while the crosses are the sites of the dual lattice , @xmath61 ; the latter are also offset by half a lattice spacing in the direction out of the paper ( the @xmath67 direction ) .",
    "the @xmath66 are all zero for @xmath68 , while the only non - zero values of @xmath69 are shown above .",
    "notice that the @xmath70 flux obeys ( [ d2]).,width=240 ]    using ( [ d2 ] ) to rewrite the berry phase in ( [ f6 ] ) , applying ( [ d1 ] ) , and shifting @xmath63 by the integer @xmath71 , we obtain a new exact representation of @xmath33 in ( [ f6 ] ) : @xmath72 the integral over the @xmath36 can be performed independently on each link , and its only consequence is the imposition of the constraint @xmath73 .",
    "we solve this constraint by writing @xmath74 as the gradient of a integer - valued ` height ' @xmath75 on the sites of the dual lattice , and so obtain @xmath76 this is the promised 2 + 1 dimensional interface , or height , model in almost its final form .",
    "the physical properties of ( [ d5 ] ) become clearer by converting the `` frustration '' @xmath66 in ( [ d5 ] ) into offsets for the allowed height values .",
    "this is done by decomposing @xmath66 into curl and divergence free parts and writing it in terms of new fixed fields , @xmath77 and @xmath78 as follows : @xmath79 the values of these new fields are shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .     and ( b ) @xmath80 introduced in ( [ xy ] ) .",
    "the notational conventions are as in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "only the @xmath35 components of @xmath80 are non - zero , and these are shown in ( b ) .",
    ", width=384 ]    inserting ( [ xy ] ) into ( [ d5 ] ) , we can now write the height model in its simplest form @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the new height variable we shall work with .",
    "notice that the @xmath80 have dropped out , while the @xmath77 act only as fractional offsets ( for @xmath9 not an even integer ) to the integer heights . from ( [ he2 ] ) we see that for half - odd - integer @xmath9 the height is restricted to be an integer on one of the four sublattices , an integer plus 1/4 on the second , an integer plus 1/2 on the third , and an integer plus 3/4 on the fourth ; the fractional parts of these heights are as shown in fig  [ fig2]a ; the steps between neighboring heights are always an integer plus 1/4 , or an integer plus 3/4 . for @xmath9 an odd integer ,",
    "the heights are integers on one square sublattice , and half - odd - integers on the second sublattice .",
    "finally for even integer",
    "@xmath9 the offset has no effect and the height is an integer on all sites .",
    "we discuss these classes of @xmath9 values in turn in the following subsections .      in this case",
    "the offsets @xmath83 are all integers , and ( [ he1 ] ) is just an ordinary three dimensional height model which has been much studied in the literature .",
    "unlike the two - dimensional case , three - dimensional height models generically have no roughening transition , and the interface is always smooth . with all heights integers ,",
    "the smooth phase breaks no lattice symmetries .",
    "so square lattice antiferromagnets with @xmath9 even integer can have a paramagnetic ground state with a spin gap and no broken symmetries .",
    "this is in accord with the exact ground state for a @xmath84 antiferromagnet on the square lattice found by affleck _",
    "_ , the aklt state @xcite .",
    "now the heights of the interface model can take four possible values , which are integers plus the offsets on the four square sublattices shown in fig  [ fig2]a . as in section",
    "[ s2 ] , the interface is always smooth _ i.e. _ any state of ( [ he1 ] ) has a fixed average interface height @xmath85 , and _ any _ well - defined value for this average height breaks the uniform shift symmetry of the height model under which @xmath86 .",
    "after accounting for the height offsets , we will see below that any smooth interface must also break a lattice symmetry with the development of _ bond order _ : this allows a number of distinct spin gap ground states of the lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "it is useful , first , to obtain a simple physical interpretation of the interface model in the language of the @xmath87 antiferromagnet @xcite . from fig",
    "[ fig2]a it is clear that nearest neighbor heights can differ either by 1/4 or 3/4 ( modulo integers ) . to minimize the action in ( [ he1 ] ) , we should choose the interface with the largest possible number of steps of @xmath88 .",
    "however , the interface is frustrated , and it is not possible to make all steps @xmath89 and at least a quarter of the steps must be @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , there is a precise one - to - one mapping between interfaces with the minimal number of @xmath90 steps ( we regard interfaces differing by a uniform integer shift in all heights as equivalent ) and the dimer coverings of the square lattice : the proof of this claim is illustrated in fig  [ fig3 ] .     in ( [ he1 ] ) .",
    "each dimer on the direct lattice is associated with a step in height of @xmath90 on the link of the dual lattice that crosses it .",
    "all other height steps are @xmath88 .",
    "each dimer represents a singlet valence between the sites , as in fig  [ fig2].,width=220 ]    we identify each dimer with a singlet valence bond between the spins ( the ellipses in fig  [ fig2 ] ) , and so each interface corresponds to a quantum state with each spin locked in the a singlet valence bond with a particular nearest neighbor .",
    "fluctuations of the interface in imaginary time between such configurations correspond to quantum tunneling events between such dimer states , and an effective hamiltonian for this is provided by the quantum dimer model @xcite .",
    "the nature of the possible smooth phases of the interface model are easy to determine from the above picture and by standard techniques from statistical theory @xcite .",
    "interfaces with average height @xmath91 ( modulo integers ) correspond to the four - fold degenerate bond - ordered states in fig  [ fig4]a , while those with @xmath92 ( modulo integers ) correspond to the four - fold degenerate plaquette bond - ordered states in fig  [ fig4]b .     on the square lattice",
    ": ( a ) the columnar spin - peierls states , and ( b ) plaquette state .",
    "the different values of the @xmath93 on the links are encoded by the different line styles .",
    "both states are 4-fold degenerate ; an 8-fold degenerate state , with superposition of the above orders , also appears as a possible ground state of the generalized interface model.,width=259 ]    all other values of @xmath94 are associated with eight - fold degenerate bond - ordered states with a superposition of the orders in fig  [ fig4]a and b.    support for the class of bond - ordered states described above has appeared in a number of numerical studies of @xmath87 antiferromagnets in @xmath55 which have succeeded in moving from the small @xmath13 nel phase to the large @xmath13 paramagnet .",
    "these include studies on the honeycomb lattice @xcite , on the planar pyrochlore lattice @xcite , on square lattice models with ring - exchange and easy - plane spin symmetry @xcite , and square lattice models with su(@xmath95 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "this case is similar to that @xmath9 half - odd - integer , and we will not consider it in detail .",
    "the berry phases again induce bond order in the spin gap state , but this order need only lead to a two - fold degeneracy .",
    "the primary topic discussed in this paper has been the effective field theory of paramagnetic mott insulators with collinear spin correlations .",
    "this field theory is the compact u(1 ) gauge theory in ( [ f5 ] ) , and applies in all spatial dimensions .",
    "we also reviewed duality mappings of ( [ f5 ] ) which are special to @xmath55 spatial dimensions , and mapped the theory onto the interface model ( [ he1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we reiterate that paramagnetic mott insulators with non - collinear spin correlations are described by a @xmath0 gauge theory which has not been presented here .",
