    "decades of active research into the phenomenology of stts ( from the early works on jordan - brans - dicke theory @xcite to the influential papers of damour and esposito - farse @xcite and many modern developments ) , together with precise solar system and pulsar timing experiments , were able to put important bounds on the parameter space of stts .",

    ".  @xcite .",
    "since the post - newtonian parameters which characterize deviations of stts from gr are all proportional to powers of @xmath15 @xcite , solar system experiments , such as the measurement of shapiro time - delay variations @xcite , mainly constrain this parameter , and , for @xmath16 sufficiently small , these tests are satisfied independently of the remaining @xmath17 .",
    "tests in the nonperturbative strong field regime are then needed in order to further constrain the parameter space of stts .",

    "@xcite that relativistic stars in stts can differ significantly from those in gr by the presence of a nontrivial scalar field profile , which could leave observable imprints , most notably , in pulsar timing observables @xcite .",

    ", we explore the possibility of using measurements of neutron stars in order to probe stts with @xmath20 ( and arbitrarily small @xmath16 ) , and thereby further restrict the parameter space of these theories .",
    "this possibility relies on the fact that , for some realistic equations of state ( eos ) , sufficiently compact neutron stars which are stable according to gr are no longer stable in some stts with @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , it has long been known @xcite that if the trace @xmath22 of the energy - momentum tensor of the stellar fluid acquires a positive value somewhere inside the star , this would lead to an instability if the underlying gravitational theory were a stt with a sufficiently large value of @xmath21 . however , as far as we know , the implications of this instability have not yet been analyzed in detail , maybe because this condition on @xmath22 was thought to be `` unnatural '' for ordinary matter .",

    "we investigate how generic this condition is and show that it can indeed be satisfied by neutron stars obeying realistic eos .",
    "the implications for stts are then analyzed for a set of these eos .",
    "in the core of neutron stars , densities up to several times the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath69 g@xmath70@xmath71 ) can be reached ; however , our current understanding of the microscopic behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is still rather poor .",
    "moreover , although the eos of neutron stars can in principle be reconstructed from precise measurements of their masses and radii @xcite , in practice it can be extremely hard to infer these quantities ( specially the radius ) from electromagnetic observations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "since there remain many uncertainties on the eos of neutron stars , it is often convenient to provide a phenomenological parametrization for it , in order to study the implications of current constraints in a generic way . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the eos was modeled as a four - parameter piecewise polytrope , and it was shown that the best fit to 34 theoretical candidate eos using this parametrization could reproduce the properties predicted by those models with good accuracy . since we will adopt this parametrization in the following , let us briefly review how it is constructed . for each rest - mass density interval @xmath72 of the piecewise polytrope , the pressure satisfies @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the adiabatic index and @xmath75 is chosen in order to ensure continuity at each boundary .",

    "although these conditions severely constrain the space of eos , we see that there is a considerable region in this space allowing for configurations inside of which @xmath22 assumes positive values .",
    "next , let us consider the piecewise polytopic approximation to the 34 eos studied in ref .",

    "the points corresponding to the remaining eos gather at @xmath102 , which is always ( trivially ) achieved at the radius of the star . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tmax ] , we see that stiff equations of state allowing for more compact stars are those for which a positive value of @xmath22 is generally found .",
    "these are characteristic of most models describing plain @xmath99 matter . on the other hand ,",
    "since the presence of hyperons , pions , kaons and quarks in general leads to softer eos , and less compact stars , we see that it tends to disfavor a positive value of @xmath22 .",
    "finally , note that , out of the 34 eos studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , only seven of them satisfy the constraints imposed by causality and the observation of a neutron star with mass around @xmath93 , namely sly , eng , mpa1 , ms1 , ms1b , h4 and alf2 .",

    "<S> scalar - tensor theories ( stts ) are a widely studied alternative to general relativity ( gr ) in which gravity is endowed with an additional scalar degree of freedom . although severely constrained by solar system and pulsar timing experiments , there remains a large set of stts which are consistent with all present day observations . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the possibility of probing a yet unconstrained region of the parameter space of stts based on the fact that stability properties of highly compact neutron stars in these theories may radically differ from those in gr . </S>"
