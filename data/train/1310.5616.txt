    "[ conjecture2 ] sorli s conjecture states that if @xmath1 is an odd perfect number given in eulerian form , then @xmath66 always holds .",
    "[ remark4 ] dris gave a sufficient condition for sorli s conjecture in @xcite .",
    "some errors , however , were found in the initial published version of that article , and dris had to retract his claim that the biconditional @xmath67 always holds .",
    "( the current published version of @xcite contains a proof only for the one - sided implication @xmath68 in two [ continually ] evolving papers [ see @xcite and @xcite ] , work is in progress to try to disprove the converse @xmath69 and thereby get a proof for conjecture [ conjecture1 ] . )    moreover , acquaah and konyagin @xcite _ almost _ disproves @xmath70 by obtaining the estimate @xmath71 under the assumption @xmath72 .",
    "( since the contrapositive of the implication @xmath73 is @xmath74 , we know that acquaah and konyagin s estimate for the euler prime @xmath2 implies that the inequality @xmath75 holds unconditionally . )",
    "curiously enough , the two papers @xcite and @xcite by dris are cited in oeis sequence a228059 @xcite , whose description is reproduced below :    odd numbers of the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is prime of the form @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 that are _ closer to being perfect than previous terms_.    _ coincidentally _ , the `` euler prime '' of the first @xmath81 terms in this oeis sequence all have exponent @xmath82 :    @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91    [ conjecture3 ] dris s conjecture states that if @xmath1 is an odd perfect number given in eulerian form , then @xmath92 always holds .    [ remark5 ] prior to the paper @xcite by acquaah and konyagin , and the data from oeis sequence a228059 @xcite as detailed out in remark [ remark4 ] , the only heuristic available to justify dris s conjecture that @xmath24 was the inequality @xmath93{2 } < \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{5 } } < i(n).\\ ] ] ( see the paper @xcite for a proof . ) in particular , the _ heuristic justification _ is that the divisibility constraint @xmath94 appears to induce an `` ordering property '' between certain divisors of an odd perfect number related via an appropriate inequality between their abundancy indices .",
    "that is , dris expects his conjecture @xmath24 to follow from the last inequality above , in the sense that the inequality @xmath95 appears to have followed from the related inequality @xmath96    additionally , note that all of the @xmath97 terms ( apart from the first one ) in the oeis sequence mentioned in remark [ remark4 ] satisfy dris s conjecture .",
    "to conclude , a recent e - mail correspondence of the author with brian d. beasley of presbyterian college revealed the following information , quoted verbatim from page 25 of @xcite :    `` before proceeding with euler s proof , we pause to note that his result was not quite what descartes and frenicle had conjectured , as they believed that @xmath98 , but it came very close .",
    "in fact , current research continues in an effort to prove @xmath98 .",
    "for example , dris has made progress in this direction , although his paper refers to descartes and frenicle s claim ( that @xmath98 ) as sorli s conjecture ; dickson has documented descartes s conjecture as occurring in a letter to marin mersenne in 1638 , with frenicle s subsequent observation occurring in 1657 . ''    it might be wise ( at this point ) to delve deeper into this little bit of history in mathematics , to attempt to answer the particular question of whether descartes and frenicle used _",
    "similar _ or totally different methods to arrive at what we have come to call as sorli s conjecture on odd perfect numbers .",
    "perhaps they _ both _ used methods similar to the ones used in this article - who knows ? besides , mersenne s predictions for succeeding primes @xmath7 for which @xmath8 turned out to be a mersenne prime were already stunning as they were .",
    "did mersenne use an _ algorithm _",
    ", for testing primality of mersenne prime - number candidates , that remains unknown to the rest of us to this day ?",
    "only time can tell .",

    "thesis adviser , and for pointing out to him the ( potentially ) feasible approach of tackling sorli s conjecture as a simplifying ( and working ) hypothesis to narrow down the search space ( for an odd perfect number ) to a bare minimum .",
