    "the physical isolation of a dwarf galaxy is often argued to be a major contributor in preserving evidence of intergalactic hi  gas in its primordial condition .",
    "isolated dwarf galaxies are thought to be very slow to enrich their neutral gas clouds , compared to the much more rapid evolution of larger galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their relatively shallow potential wells are argued to be inefficient in retaining the heavy element abundances generated by supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this picture is consistent with the mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which shows that smaller galaxies generally exhibit lower nebular metallicity than larger ones .",
    "investigating the nature of this relation was one of the motivations behind the sigrid sample of isolated gas - rich dwarf galaxies @xcite , which , _",
    "inter alia _ , seeks to clarify the behaviour of the mass - metallicity relation at low galactic masses .",
    "it has also been suggested that dwarf galaxies residing in low density environments ( e.g. , in voids ) have lower metallicities , and in some cases , very low mass - to - light ratios , compared to similar objects in higher density regions @xcite .",
    "therefore is is useful to investigate whether spatially isolated galaxies in voids are in any way unusual , in terms of mass - to - light ratio or metallicity , compared to similar objects in denser environments .",
    "we have identified two isolated gas - rich dwarf galaxies in the sigrid sample located within the local void for investigation , [ kk98]246 ( eso 461-g036 ) , hereafter `` kk246 '' and mcg-01 - 41 - 006 ( hipass j1609 - 04 ) , hereafter `` j1609 '' .",
    "kk246 is relatively nearby ( 6.4 mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "j1609 - 04 is somewhat more massive and luminous , but is over twice as distant , at 14.82 mpc @xcite .",
    "we present the spectra and nebular metallicity results for the two galaxies , and compare them with data from other investigations of void galaxies .",

    "this void is large , at least 23mpc in radius @xcite , and kk246 has no apparent neighbours within @xmath1mpc @xcite . assuming a spatial peculiar velocity of 100 - 200kms@xmath2 this translates into a time of 15 - 30 gyr since the last possible galaxy - galaxy encounter . as such",
    ", the object is an ideal laboratory in which to study galaxy evolution and self - enrichment in isolation .",
    "it is of particular interest in understanding the intrinsic evolutionary processes in the formation of this small galaxy , as almost certainly it has never been affected by tidal disruption by nearby large galaxies , nor by enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from which it formed by outflows from such galaxies .",
    "it has no detectable adjacent dwarf galaxies , unlike the low metallicity lsb galaxies in the lynx - cancer void at 18mpc investigated by @xcite .",
    "previous observations of kk246 have shown that the stellar component is embedded in a large surrounding hi  cloud ( kreckel et al .",
    "2011 ) and contains an old stellar population @xcite .",
    "although it currently has only one small , low - luminosity star - forming hii  region , we have been able to measure the nebular metallicity of that region using the wifes ifu spectrograph on the anu 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "this paper reports the first measurement of the nebular spectrum and resultant nebular metallicities .      using hst imagery and photometry ,",
    "@xcite measured the trgb distance to kk246 as 7.83 mpc .",

    "kk246 is within the void @xcite . in the calculations in this paper",
    ", we have used the value from tully et  al . , but our conclusions do not depend on which value is adopted .",

    "a better figure may be 10:1 or less , especially for less intense starburst episodes .",
    "the individual star - forming regions in j1609 - 04 vary in metallicity between 8.0 and 8.2 .",
    "the metallicity of the regions do not correlate with their intrinsic luminosities , but this could be explained by the regions being of slightly different ages .",
    "the hi  region surrounding kk246 implies a plentiful supply of neutral hydrogen available for cold mode accretion .",
    "such accretion has been observed in the void galaxy survey in some galaxies @xcite , and in sag dig in the local group @xcite .    from this , one may postulate a narrative for the development of small isolated galaxies .",
    "if they form early in the history of the universe , with continuing hi  available for cold inflow accretion , they will exhibit periodic star formation and evolve normally .",
    "their stellar populations will span a range of ages .",
    "supernova ejecta and stellar winds from the older stars will enrich the interstellar medium of the galaxy and a substantial fraction of the metallicity will be retained . as a result",
    "the nebular metallicities will grow with time and will not be exceptionally low . while @xcite suggest that galaxies form later and evolve more slowly in regions of low density , this appears inconsistent with the old stellar populations in the two objects discussed here .",
    "we also speculate that extremely low metallicity objects such as 1zw18 @xcite and sbs 0335 - 052w @xcite are probably exceptional , and the absence of significant older stellar populations indicates that they have most likely formed recently from pristine gas .",
    "the details of the older stellar population of 1zw18 are not completely settled @xcite , but it has been claimed that there is no stellar population older than @xmath6500myr @xcite .",
    "the question is still in dispute @xcite .",
    "the irregular nature and complex kinematics of the hi  regions surrounding 1zw18 @xcite and to a lesser extent , sbs 0335 - 052w @xcite , suggests that they are still in the process of forming .",
    "they may be the modern analogs of the so - called `` faint blue galaxies '' at redshifts 1 @xmath50 z @xmath50 2 @xcite .",
    "this has also been suggested by @xcite .",
    "the `` bloated '' objects noted in the sigrid sample @xcite may be similar objects .",
    "we have already observed some of these , and we plan to present data on their metallicities in a subsequent paper .",
    "in this paper we present the first spectroscopic and nebular metallicity analysis of the two isolated dwarf gas - rich irregular galaxies , [ kk98]246 and mcg-01 - 41 - 006 .",
    "these objects were observed at resolutions of 3000 and 7000 , with very good signal - to - noise ratios , using the wifes ifu spectrograph on the anu 2.3 metre telescope at siding spring . to measure the metallicities ,",
    "we have used the @xmath46 direct method ( for the mcg galaxy ) and the latest strong line methods from @xcite .",
    "we find that despite their location within or at the edge of the local void , their metallicities are no lower than other similar less isolated dwarf galaxies , with values of 8.17@xmath240.01 and 8.04@xmath240.05 , respectively ( and 7.96@xmath240.06 for j1609 - 04 ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) using the @xmath46 method ) .",
    "we suggest that isolated dwarf galaxies like these , with available inflows of hi  gas , will evolve normally , without the need for interactions with other galaxies . as a result",
    ", we believe that dwarf galaxies with exceptionally low metallicities are not the norm in voids , and that isolated dwarf irregular galaxies do not necessarily provide insights into the primordial intergalactic medium .",
