    "the literature on fluid dynamics offers a wide range of exact solutions , suitable to almost any kind of applications ( see for instance @xcite for a review ) .",
    "many examples are built starting from _ vector spherical harmonic _ functions , which are generally used as expansion basis for more advanced scenarios ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we deal with some of these functions , which have not to be confused with their simpler version related to the _ scalar _ laplace equation in spherical coordinates ( see for instance @xcite , p.121 ) .",
    "for this reason , this section is going to be a bit technical .",
    "we discuss a specific situation from the fluid dynamics viewpoint , in order to prepare the ground to generalizations that will allow in section 3 to construct families of solutions defined on evolving vortex rings .",
    "first of all , we introduce the family of bessel functions of the first kind : @xmath0 where , in our context , @xmath1 is a real positive parameter .",
    "it is known that , for @xmath2 tending to zero , the following asymptotic estimate holds : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gamma function .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 turns out to be bounded , since it decays to zero as @xmath6 , for @xmath7 , with an oscillating behavior . for other properties on bessel functions the reader",
    "is addressed to @xcite .",
    "successively , it is necessary to introduce the set of legendre polynomials : @xmath8~~n\\geq 0\\ ] ] by the substitution @xmath9 , the above equation takes the form : @xmath10    we are now ready to work in spherical coordinates : @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "let us start by fixing @xmath15 and defining the stationary vector field @xmath16 whose components are : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 note that there is no dependence on the variable @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , there is cylindrical symmetry along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "later , in section 4 , we will generalize this setting .",
    "afterwards , one defines the time - dependent field @xmath22 given by : @xmath23 the constant @xmath24 will play the role of viscosity parameter .",
    "we start by discussing the regularity of @xmath25 .",
    "of course , the same arguments will apply to @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "it should be clear that @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "less evident is the situation at the origin ( @xmath30 ) . for @xmath31 , thanks to ( [ eq : as1 ] ) we deduce that @xmath25 tends to zero .",
    "therefore , a continuous prolongation is obtained by setting @xmath32 at the origin .",
    "the differentiability follows from an analysis similar to that of the more delicate case @xmath33 , to which we are now going to concentrate our attention .",
    "let us first note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , it is known that : @xmath36 thus , in a neighborhood of the origin one gets : @xmath37 the second component of @xmath25 follows a similar asymptotic behavior : @xmath38",
    "the important fact is that the coefficients in ( [ eq : exj2 ] ) and ( [ eq : exj3 ] ) not depending on @xmath2 are the same .    in order to understand what is actually happening for @xmath30",
    "it is better to argue in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the local orthogonal triplet of the spherical reference framework , has the expression : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 with @xmath42 @xmath43 neglecting higher order infinitesimal terms , near the origin one has from ( [ eq : exj2 ] ) and ( [ eq : exj3 ] ) : @xmath44 by placing at the origin the vector @xmath45 ( written in cartesian coordinates ) one gets a continuous vector field .",
    "a more careful analysis shows that @xmath25 can be differentiated infinite times .",
    "a plot of @xmath46 near the origin of the plane @xmath47 is shown in figure 1 . due to the decay at infinity of bessel functions ,",
    "the whole field is bounded in @xmath48",
    ".        qualitative displacement of the field @xmath46 near the origin for @xmath33 .",
    "the plot shows the projection on the plane @xmath49 obtained from ( [ eq : coor ] ) by setting @xmath50 .",
    "the vector fields previously introduced satisfy a series of striking results that we are going to recall .",
    "the first important relation is that , independently of @xmath51 , @xmath26 has zero divergence : @xmath52 the proof is obtained by a direct check . indeed , for @xmath53 ,",
    "thanks to ( [ eq : let ] ) one recovers @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 = ~0\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : div ] ) is also true at the origin . to check this , one can use either ( [ eq : ort3 ] ) or symmetry arguments ( from the physical viewpoint in any neighborhood of the origin the inbound flow equates that directed outbound ) .    another",
    "important fact is that @xmath26 satisfies the parabolic equation : @xmath59 the statement follows from writing the laplace operator in spherical coordinates .",
    "considering that there is no dependence on the variable @xmath20 , the expression of the operator looks rather simplified : @xmath60 @xmath61~=~\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\frac{\\partial \\hat v_1}{\\partial t}\\ ] ]    @xmath62 @xmath63~=~\\frac{1}{\\nu}\\frac{\\partial \\hat v_2}{\\partial t}\\ ] ]    @xmath64    the check of the above formulas , by direct substitution of the expressions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , requires however a generous amount of patience .",
    "we do not report such details here .",
    "we just recall that the equations ( [ eq : bes ] ) and ( [ eq : leg ] ) must be used with profusion .",
    "a simpler verification is obtained by recovering a potential vector @xmath67 such that @xmath68 ( see section 3 ) and showing that @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that @xmath70 ( recall that @xmath25 has zero divergence ) , and this last relation implies ( [ eq : aut ] ) .",
    "similar solutions can be found in the 2d framework .",
    "for instance , working in polar coordinates @xmath71 , we define for @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the @xmath51-th chebyshev polynomial .",
    "again , one has @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "after having introduced the velocity field @xmath26 , we need to explain its role in the framework of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "the origin must be regarded as the bottleneck of a generous amount of fluid entering for @xmath77 and exiting for @xmath78 .",
    "nevertheless , this is not enough to generate singularities in the field or its derivatives .",
    "such an observation continues to be true even by introducing a swirl in the @xmath20 direction , as we shall see in section 4 .",
    "a further property of the field @xmath46 is that its rotational has a very simple expression : @xmath79 where the third component has been computed via the formula : @xmath80\\ ] ] due the asymptotic expression ( [ eq : as1 ] ) , the rotational goes smoothly to zero at the origin as @xmath81 .",
    "considering that @xmath82 is bounded , the field @xmath83 also goes to zero at the origin .",
    "we now set : @xmath84 @xmath85    by applying well - known notions of differential calculus , one may write : @xmath86 therefore , using ( [ eq : aut ] ) , we finally have : @xmath87 recalling the divergence - free condition ( [ eq : as1 ] ) , we may argue that the couple @xmath26 , @xmath88 satisfies the 3d navier - stokes problem with the forcing term @xmath89 and the initial condition @xmath90 at time @xmath91 .",
    "note that our pressure is negative , but this is not a problem , since a scalar potential is defined up to an additive constant and @xmath92 is bounded in the whole @xmath48 space .",
    "the choice of @xmath88 looks physically correct .",
    "the quantity @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the mass density , is related to kinetic energy . in the incompressible case , which is the one we are studying here , @xmath94 is constant in @xmath48 ( assume @xmath95 ) .",
    "the setting is in agreement with the bernoulli principle , stating that the quantity @xmath96 is preserved along the stream - lines .",
    "thus , the balance between @xmath97 and the gradient part of @xmath98 only involves energy properties belonging to the fluid , while the extra - force @xmath89 ( not of conservative type in our case ) represents external constraints .",
    "including potential functions of conservative fields , such as gravity , in the pressure term is an allowed procedure ( in this fashion , when considering the case of gravitational potentials , pressure directly turns out to decay with altitude ) .",
    "effective forcing terms can be built with fields having the rotational different from zero .",
    "note for instance that , if ( [ eq : set ] ) was replaced by the setting @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we would get an incompatible situation since the advective term is not the gradient of any potential .",
    "our solution is defined in @xmath48 .",
    "of course , a fictitious boundary - value problem on an open domain @xmath101 may be obtained by assigning on @xmath102 the restriction of the field @xmath26 , @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath101 is a sphere of radius @xmath104 centered at the origin , there are two interesting situations to be mentioned . if @xmath104 is a zero of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , we have that the radial component on @xmath102 is identically zero , so the boundary field is tangential .",
    "the boundary datum is purely radial if instead @xmath104 is a zero of @xmath107 .",
    "assuming that @xmath104 is the first zero of @xmath108 ( the most interesting case is @xmath33 , where @xmath104 is approximately equal to @xmath109 ) , we can interpret the solution as a stable vortex ring @xmath101 .",
    "tangential velocity is imposed on the boundary and the term @xmath89 plays the role of centripetal force keeping the fluid in stationary circular motion . in truth",
    "the domain @xmath101 is a degenerate toroid where the central hole is reduced to a segment of the vertical axis @xmath21 , i.e. , we are simulating a hill s type vortex ( see , e.g. , @xcite , p.175 ) .",
    "the same construction can be considered in the 2d case ( see ( [ eq : pol ] ) ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath89 is given by @xmath110 , which is tending to zero at the origin ( see ( [ eq : as1 ] ) ) for any @xmath15 .",
    "let us also note that in order to get a time decay at infinity for the solution proportional to @xmath111 , as the dissipative term prescribes , our forcing field @xmath89 must go to zero at least as @xmath112 , i.e. quadratically faster .",
    "this observation indicates that the time smoothness properties of the right - hand side should enter more formally in the a priori estimates , if one looks for regularity theorems .    in the theoretical analysis of the navier - stokes equations ,",
    "the gradient terms are usually eliminated by projection into the space of functions with null divergence .",
    "an alternative approach is to differentiate the momentum equation . by taking the rotational on both sides ,",
    "one gets for some right - hand side @xmath113 : @xmath114 where the vorticity @xmath115 automatically satisfies @xmath116 . in",
    "this way we again eliminate the gradient term @xmath117 .",
    "note that @xmath115 does not satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions , making difficult the theoretical analysis of ( [ eq : rof ] ) .    from the explicit expression of @xmath46 , a certain number of collateral problems can be examined .",
    "for instance , one can try to find @xmath118 and @xmath119 such that : @xmath120 @xmath121 here @xmath122 , where @xmath25 is defined in ( [ eq : vec ] ) and @xmath123 is a given positive function of time with @xmath124 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath123 grows for a while , then it decays fast to zero . both @xmath113 and @xmath125 are defined in @xmath48 .",
    "the solution @xmath118 is expected to develop the same vortices as the field @xmath26 introduced before .",
    "this should happen as soon as @xmath126 .",
    "things may however depend on the rate of growth of @xmath123 .",
    "we guess ( but this is just a conjecture to be verified with numerical simulations ) that , if @xmath123 follows a slow growth at the beginning , viscosity might dominate smoothing out the solution . alternatively",
    ", if @xmath123 has a rapid increase , the rotatory behavior may catch up and persist .",
    "a variant of the example above is reformulated by replacing @xmath127 in ( [ eq : pr1 ] ) by a uniformly approximating sequence @xmath128 of functions .",
    "we can let the parameter @xmath129 depend on @xmath130 , in such a way that the limit @xmath131 is reached in a finite time @xmath132 .",
    "it is possible to define @xmath133 in the time interval @xmath1340,t[$ ] in order to get solutions representing classical vortex rings ( i.e. , closed vortex tubes shaped like a doughnut ) tending to a hill s type vortex as @xmath135 .",
    "we study in the next section a general recipe to generate this kind of sequences .",
    "let us now introduce a general approach to get families of solutions defined on rings .",
    "we first observe that a vector potential @xmath67 may be assigned to the field @xmath25 in ( [ eq : vec ] ) .",
    "this is such that @xmath136 and explicitly given by @xmath137 , where : @xmath138 information on vector potentials can be for instance retrieved in @xcite , p.53 , where connections with magnetic fields are also mentioned .",
    "it turns out that @xmath67 is zero along the @xmath21-axis .    comparing with ( [ eq : rot ] )",
    ", we deduce that @xmath139 . as a consequence , by observing that @xmath140 , the following relation holds : @xmath141 therefore @xmath67 is an eigenfunction of the vector laplacian , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath142 . more precisely , the sphere @xmath101 centered at the origin of radius @xmath104 ( the first zero of @xmath108 ) , deprived of the vertical axis , is such that the smallest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath143 is equal to 1 .",
    "the homogeneous boundary conditions associated to such an operator are of dirichlet type , including in the boundary also the vertical segment at the intersection of the sphere and the @xmath21-axis .",
    "they can be however substituted by tangential type conditions : @xmath144 with @xmath145 denoting the outward normal field on @xmath102 , that is what we got for the field @xmath46 .    in order to examine other similar situations",
    ", we work with cylindrical coordinates @xmath146 . we look for vector potentials of the form @xmath137 , where @xmath147 does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "in addition we would like to impose ( [ eq : rep ] ) and ( [ eq : tbc ] ) .",
    "we are then requiring that @xmath142 must be the first eigenvalue , so restricting a bit the choice of the domain @xmath101 . in terms of the only unknown @xmath147 ,",
    "the vector differential problem becomes : @xmath148 one can easily check that the two other components of @xmath149 are zero .",
    "the scalar equation ( [ eq : pep ] ) is either subject to homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions or to the boundary constraint : @xmath150    the above equations can be simplified further by setting @xmath151 . by this substitution",
    "our problem takes the form : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the section of the toroid region @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath154 is determined up to multiplicative constants ( related to the intensity of the final velocity field ) . on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : peb ] )",
    "we have a positive definite operator , as a result of little manipulation after multiplying by @xmath155 and integrating on @xmath153 .",
    "since there is no dependence on @xmath20 , we can simulate flows on vortex rings having a symmetry axis coincident with the @xmath21-axis .",
    "an analysis of this kind has been considered in @xcite from a different perspective , where inviscid fluids are coupled with electromagnetism .",
    "note that the example introduced in section 1 for @xmath33 is related to famous hertz solution , aimed to describe the electromagnetic field emanated by an infinitesimal dipole .",
    "extensions , examined through a series of numerical tests , have been successively investigated in @xcite .",
    "the results and the techniques there presented may be suitably adapted to the study of vortex formation and stability .",
    "for example , let @xmath153 be the circle of radius @xmath104 , situated in the plane @xmath156 and centered at a point of the semi - axis @xmath55 very far away from the origin . by neglecting the terms in ( [ eq : pep ] ) containing @xmath2 at the denominator ,",
    "the function @xmath147 solves the 2d laplace eigenvalue equation .",
    "the minimum eigenvalue in @xmath153 is approximately equal to @xmath157 ( where @xmath158 is the first zero of @xmath159 ) , so that , by taking @xmath160 , we get a reasonably good solution of problem ( [ eq : rep ] ) .",
    "indeed , the 3d ring @xmath101 with circular section @xmath153 and vertical axis @xmath21 is a domain where the equation @xmath161 can be almost perfectly solved in terms of orthogonal basis functions .",
    "there are infinite other rings , more or less of the same shape and size as @xmath101 , where ( [ eq : rep ] ) holds once one knows the eigenfunctions of ( [ eq : peb ] ) .",
    "when the section @xmath153 approaches the origin , we can flatten the part of it facing the @xmath21-axis , while preserving the minimum eigenvalue @xmath142 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the result is the transformation of standard ring into a hill s type one .",
    "the flow in @xmath101 may be defined by setting @xmath162 .",
    "thus , as done in section 2 , the full set of navier - stokes equations ( including the @xmath163 condition ) is satisfied by writing : @xmath164 where the gradient term on the right - hand side has been assimilated to a gradient of pressure , while the rest is a forcing source .",
    "this last centripetal acceleration is the one needed to maintain the flow constrained in the ring @xmath101 .",
    "the energy of the flow is exponentially fading in time due to viscosity . in",
    "the above mentioned procedure it is not clear how to prolong the field @xmath165 outside @xmath101 .",
    "realistically , the external fluid is dragged by viscous effects .",
    "the fluid across the boundary @xmath102 is continuous but may lose regularity there .",
    "this is the same difficulty one may find in the study of typhoons , at the interface between the central core and the peripheral dragged flow .",
    "the request that the eigenvalue @xmath166 remains equal to a given constant is quite important in the framework of electromagnetic applications ( where @xmath167 and @xmath168 is the speed of light ) , but it is not crucial in fluid dynamics .",
    "we just have to pay attention when passing to the parabolic equation @xmath169 . for",
    "any fixed @xmath130 , let @xmath170 be the stationary solution satisfying : @xmath171 . as previously done",
    ", one sets @xmath172 .",
    "the function @xmath123 has to be then determined according to the relation : @xmath1730,t[\\ ] ] yielding the exponential @xmath174 in the particular case @xmath142 .",
    "sections of evolving tori . starting from a classical ring having circular section ( right )",
    ", one can deform the shape and obtain through a sequence of intermediate rings a spherical doughnut ( left ) where the hole is reduced to a vertical segment .",
    "a classical way of looking for troubled solutions of the navier - stokes equations is to let evolve regular vortex tubes in order to create a singularity at some point .",
    "considerations about this hypothesis are reported for instance in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , section 5.4 .",
    "some theoretical implications are examined in @xcite .",
    "therefore , from our viewpoint , one can imagine a smooth ring driven by an internal force @xmath133 changing with time . in a finite time",
    ", the process ends up with the flow constricted into a hill s vortex , where the set of equations are actually solved on a spherical domain .",
    "note that , due to incompressibility , the volume of these rings must remain constant .",
    "this is also true because we are imposing tangential boundary conditions ( see ( [ eq : tbc ] ) ) , therefore the fluid can not escape .    in the plane @xmath156 , a possible transition from a classical vortex ring displaying circular section into a spherical vortex is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the evolution of the boundary may be described for @xmath175 $ ] by the formula : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is a time - dependent decreasing function satisfying s(1)=0 . for @xmath91",
    ", we have the circumference of radius @xmath178 centered at @xmath179 . after a sudden change of topology , for @xmath180 we obtain the semi - circumference of radius 1 centered at the origin .",
    "this construction is only given to qualitatively illustrate the situation .",
    "we do not know for example if the family of rings built by rotating the domains of figure 2 around the @xmath21-axis preserves the eigenvalue @xmath142 as prescribed by ( [ eq : rep ] ) .",
    "it seems however that no irregularity turns out to be present at the end of this process , since the solution presented in section 2 is smooth up to the origin .",
    "this does not prove that any attempt to collapse a ring hole into a point ( or a segment ) , according to the equations , is going to fail .",
    "nevertheless , the percentage of success in the search of anomalous solutions of this type becomes very low .",
    "we finish by retouching the solution defined in section 2 .",
    "we now add a component along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "thus , we go back to spherical coordinates @xmath181 and recall the field @xmath25 defined in ( [ eq : vec ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we only discuss the case @xmath33 .",
    "we now define : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a given number .",
    "practically , the stationary flow , while behaving as in figure 1 , also moves around the vertical axis .",
    "the third component in ( [ eq : vem ] ) is zero for @xmath30 by virtue of ( [ eq : as1 ] ) . by computing the rotational ,",
    "we now get : @xmath184 where @xmath147 is given in ( [ eq : poa ] ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath185 , so we are dealing with the same kind of solutions previously studied .",
    "such solutions are defined everywhere . however , by denoting with @xmath104 the first zero of @xmath186 ( which is approximately equal to @xmath109 ) , the solution can be restricted to the sphere centered at the origin of radius @xmath104 .",
    "though @xmath25 still does not depend on @xmath20 , the modified flow field twists in the direction of the vector @xmath187 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "note that the boundary conditions to be assigned on the surface of the sphere of radius @xmath104 only contain the component along @xmath188 .",
    "as figure 3 indicates , the field has only a vertical ( along the @xmath21-axis ) component at the origin . in the immediate surroundings , a component along @xmath187 develops , which can be very strong in magnitude since its strength depends on @xmath183 , which is arbitrary . therefore ,",
    "sharp layers are observed near the origin , although the solution continues to be smooth . together with the origin ,",
    "other critical regions of sharp layer formation are at the poles of the sphere .    the trajectory of a particle is practically untwisted near the external boundary .",
    "in this situation the orbits are mildly precessing .",
    "nevertheless , as the particle gets to the pole , is pushed towards the center and starts spiraling until it reemerges near the opposite pole . for particles placed inside the sphere far from the axis and the boundary ,",
    "the orbits tend to follow a helicoid with circular section , turning around the @xmath21-axis . there might be no periodicity in this complex motion .",
    "the field of the new spherical vortex combines the component describing the rotation within each section with a perpendicular one following closed circular patterns around the vertical axis .",
    "the horizontal velocities are different depending on the distance from the origin .",
    "in the neighborhood of the origin ( picture on the right ) , the trajectories pass with continuity from a pure vertical motion to spirals .",
    "the variation can be particularly significant , especially when @xmath183 is large .",
    "when we compute the product @xmath189 , it should be evident that its first two components tend to zero for @xmath190 .",
    "the third one takes the form : @xmath191 a careful analysis shows that this also tends to zero for @xmath190 .",
    "we can argue locally in the neighborhood of the origin by working in cartesian coordinates . in this way , excluding third - order terms , the expression given in ( [ eq : ort3 ] ) has to be modified as follows : @xmath192 considering that @xmath193 , one ends up with the approximation : @xmath194 @xmath195 the special choice @xmath196 , that allows the above terms to tend to zero faster at the origin , worth to be recorded .",
    "for this value of @xmath183 , the divergence of @xmath197 is zero at the origin .",
    "an interesting collateral problem to be studied is when the initial solution of the homogeneous ( @xmath198 ) navier - stokes equations it taken to be equal to @xmath25 . in addition , the flow is constantly supplied at the boundary of the sphere of radius @xmath104 with the stationary values of @xmath25 . in absence of the forcing term it is reasonable to expect a decay to zero at the origin due to viscosity .",
    "this should be true independently of @xmath183 , but strange surprises could also happen .",
    "it would be wise to run some numerical tests to verify the behavior .    of course , one can add a twisting also to the annular flows introduced in section 3 . in cylindrical coordinates it is enough to search for solutions of the form @xmath199 , where @xmath200 does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "if we require that simultaneously @xmath201 and @xmath202 , we arrive at the equation : @xmath203 to be solved in the section @xmath153 .",
    "the solution is determined up to a constant @xmath183 . by imposing homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions",
    "we get that the flow is swirling only at the interior of the ring . for a ring with small circular section with respect to the major diameter",
    ", the solution of the full navier - stokes equations leads to a component along the @xmath20 direction similar to that of a poiseuille type flow .",
    "as before , the section @xmath153 may be deformed depending on time as suggested by the plots of figure 2 , so ending up with a configuration as the one depicted in figure 3 .    in conclusion , we proposed a set of explicit solutions of the non - homogeneous navier - stokes equations expressed in spherical coordinates with the help of bessel functions .",
    "these are defined in the whole 3d space , but they can be easily restated in a spherical domain subject to suitable tangential conditions .",
    "the flow rotates forming a hill s vortex remaining smooth up to the inner point .",
    "a twist may be also introduced , but this does not alter the regularity of the solution .",
    "this example suggests that the search of blowing up solutions of the 3d navier - stokes equations is not going to be easy , since most of the counterexamples are built on the idea of crashing vortex tubes in order to detect possible degenerations at some meeting point .",
    "together with the mentioned examples , we also proposed a way to explicitly construct vortex rings , that can be helpful in various other circumstances , both for theoretical and computational aspects ."
