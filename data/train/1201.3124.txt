    "<S> the observed density of dark matter is of the magnitude expected for a thermal relic weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) . in addition , the observed baryon density is within an order of magnitude of the dark matter density . </S>",

    "<S> an example based on @xmath9 affleck - dine leptogenesis is given in @xcite , where dark matter is due to a condensate of right - handed sneutrinos    1 however , there are in fact _ two _ seperate coincidences . 1 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> why are the baryon and dark matter densities similar to each other ? 1 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> why are they similar to the `` wimp miracle '' density ? </S>",
    "<S> ( most models do not address 2 . )    </S>",
    "<S> the `` wimp miracle '' refers to the natural similarity of the observed dark matter density and the thermal relic density of particles with weak - scale masses and interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this is widely interpreted as a strong indication that dark matter is due to thermal relic wimps . for dark matter with constant @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the non - relativistic annihilation cross - section </S>",
    "<S> , the observed dark matter density requires @xmath12 the dm annihilation cross - section may be expresed in terms of the annihilation matrix element @xmath13 as < </S>",
    "<S> v_rel > =  .the matrix element is dimensionless and typically has the form @xmath14 . where @xmath15 is an effective coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore < v_rel > = 1.6 10 ^ -9 ( ) ^4 ( ) ^2 ^-2  .therefore if @xmath8 is in the range @xmath16 and if @xmath15 is not too much smaller than the weak interaction coupling @xmath17 ( which is natural as @xmath15 can have additional factors from mixing angles , mass ratios etc ) , then we get the right amount of thermal relic dark matter .    </S>",
    "<S> if the wimp miracle does explain dark matter , and if we discount coincidence and antropic selection , then we need to explain why the baryon asymmetry is also similar to the wimp miracle density . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity to the dark matter density then _ follows _ from this i.e. the observed baryon to dark matter ratio is actually due to a more fundamental relation between each of the densities and the wimp miracle density .    in @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we presented one approach to making this connection , based on a mechanism we call _ baryomorphosis_. [ recently an alternative approach to achieving a wimp - like baryon asymmetry , _ wimpy baryogenesis _ </S>",
    "<S> , has been proposed in @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this idea of baryomorphosis that the _ observed _ baryon density is determined by a process similar to thermal relic wimp freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> the model does not explain the baryon asymmetry , but modifies a large initial baryon asymmetry into a final thermal wimp - like baryon asymmetry ; hence `` baryomorphosis '' rather than `` baryogenesis '' .    </S>",
    "<S> 1 the ingredients of the baryomorphosis mechanism are :    1 @xmath1 an initial baryon asymmetry , for example in a heavy particle @xmath18 which is out of thermal equilibrium , which decays at a low temperature @xmath19 .    1 @xmath1 pairs of new scalar particles , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , called `` annihilons '' , to which @xmath18 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the annihilons have opposite standard model ( sm ) charges but , crucially , do have opposite baryon numbers . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are distinct particles which can have different masses , although for simplicity we will consider their masses to be equal in the following .    1 @xmath1 a b - violating interaction which is broadly of weak interaction strength , via which @xmath20 and @xmath21 annihilate , leaving a thermal wimp - like baryon number density .    1 @xmath1 a mechanism to transfer the baryon asymmetry from annihilons to conventional quarks .    1 this </S>",
    "<S> is illustrated schematically in figure 1 .        </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite a simple model implementing the baryomorphosis mechanism was presented . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the annihilons annihilate to a complex boson @xmath22 via a renormalizable b - violating interaction of the form _ </S>",
    "<S> _ b ann = _ b _ b ^ + h. c.  .note that the @xmath22 can not be the higgs boson , since the @xmath20 , @xmath21 will mix once the higgs vev is introduced , resulting in a b - violating mass insertion which will wash out the annihilon asymmetry via scattering from thermal background quarks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the final state in the b - violating annihilation must have no vev .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the original model in @xcite has some features which do not have a symmetry explanation and must therefore simply be imposed :    1 @xmath1 there is no symmetry to prevent b - violating mass mixing terms like @xmath23 ( @xmath4 b washout ) .    1 @xmath1 there is no suppression of renormalizable couplings of @xmath20 to sm fermions ( @xmath4 @xmath20 decay too rapidly , before annihilating ) .    1 in addition , </S>",
    "<S> although it is not really problem , no wimp dark matter candidate is specified .    in order to address these issues , in @xcite a model was presented which uses a simple discrete symmetry to ensure no @xmath20 @xmath21 mixing terms leading to baryon washout . </S>",
    "<S> since additional discrete symmetries are necessary to evade b washout , and since additional symmetries are also necessary to stabilize dark matter , it is natural to identify as dark matter particles the additional fields necessary as final states in the @xmath20 @xmath21 annihilation process . </S>",
    "<S> the model can be naturally combined with gauge singlet ( or inert doublet @xcite ) dark matter to provide a unified model of baryomorphosis and scalar wimp dark matter .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a pair of real singlet scalars @xmath24 @xmath25 plus a @xmath26 discrete symmetry of the annihilons , @xmath27 , ; - ; s s ; -  , with all sm fields invariant under @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this eliminates the dangerous b - violating mass mixing terms @xmath23 and @xmath28 but allows the b - violating annihilation process _ _ b ann = _ b _ b s + h. c.  .note that @xmath20 and @xmath21 must carry gauge charges to prevent the dangerous terms @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which are allowed under @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> we need a sceond discrete symmetry to stabilize the dark matter , @xmath31 , s - s ; -  . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 symmetry then allows the coupling to the sm : s s h^h + h^ h  . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the @xmath24 and @xmath25 to annihilate down to a thermal wimp - like dark matter density .    </S>",
    "<S> the formation of the final baryon asymmetry and dark matter density in this model is shown schematically in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> as before , the initial annihilon asymmetry is injected at a low temperature @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24 and @xmath25 subsequently annihilate down to thermal wimp - like density if @xmath34 , or to a standard thermal wimp density if @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the freeze - out temperature of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 dark matter .        </S>",

    "<S> _ = ( 1- ) ^1/2  .the freeze - out number density at @xmath38 is then n_(t_d )  .(the @xmath21 number density is the same when @xmath39 . ) </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath20 later decays to baryon number @xmath40 and @xmath21 to @xmath41 , the baryon asymmetry to dark matter ratio at present , @xmath42 , is given by r_bdm = 3 ( b ( ) + b ( ) ) ( ) ^1/2  .here @xmath43 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath44 is the nucleon mass , @xmath45 the critical density , @xmath46 is the present photon temperature and @xmath47 . </S>",

    "<S> in this we have assumed that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are non - relativistic when the b - violating annihilation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this is generally true for gauge - charged @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also true in @xmath24 and @xmath25 annihilation provided @xmath49 @xcite .    in figure 3 </S>",
    "<S> we show the annihilon mass as a function of the b injection temperature @xmath38 for different values of the baryon - to - dark matter ratio @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we have set @xmath51 , which are dimensionally natural values in particle physics models . </S>",
    "<S> since the mystery of the baryon - to - dark matter ratio may be considered why they are within an order of magnitude of each other , we have shown @xmath50 in the range 0.1 to 10 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that a wide range of annihilon masses in the 100 gev to 10 tev range is compatible with @xmath50 in the range 0.1 to 10 when @xmath38 is in the range 0.1 gev to 100 gev . </S>",
    "<S> there is also an upper bound on @xmath38 from the requirement that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the freeze - out temperature of the b - violating annihilation process , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 equals a few hundred gev for the range of @xmath55 considered in figure 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore we see that for a wide range of @xmath38 , @xmath56 to @xmath57 , the baryon density is naturally within an order of magnitude of the dark matter density . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that a low @xmath38 is essential for a baryon asymmetry to exist at all . )    in figure 3 we have also shown lines for @xmath55 equal to 2 tev and 3 tev , corresponding to bounds that may be achieveable for coloured scalars at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the observed @xmath58 favours annihilon masses less than @xmath59 3 tev over the range of @xmath38 from 0.1 to 100 gev </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , should the annihilons be coloured , there is a good prospect of producing them at the lhc .        in the case </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are degenerate in mass , both scalars are stable and contribute to dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> a key requirement is that @xmath60 , so that the @xmath20 @xmath21 annihilation process is kinematically allowed . if @xmath34 , then the @xmath24 and @xmath25 dark matter density is non - thermal , coming from the @xmath24 and @xmath25 produced as final state particles in @xmath20 @xmath21 annihilation </S>",
    "<S> this gives an enhancement of the density by @xmath61 relative to the thermal relic @xmath24 density , _ </S>",
    "<S> dm = ( ) ^1/2  .if @xmath35 then the dark matter is purely thermal relic in nature . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we can approximately replace @xmath38 by @xmath62 in . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath63 is shown in figure 4 for higgs mass @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath48 . in figure 5 </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath63 together with @xmath55 . for all @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24 mass is much less than the @xmath20 mass , as required for consistency of the model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for most @xmath38 the @xmath24 freeze - out temperature is less than @xmath38 , so that @xmath24 dark matter is in fact thermal relic in nature . </S>",
    "<S> non - thermal @xmath24 dark matter is found only at @xmath66 .            </S>",
    "<S> 1 we conclude that a consistent baryomorphosis model can be constructed using only a simple @xmath67 symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> 1 so far we have produced a thermal wimp - like baryon asymmetry in @xmath20 and @xmath21 particles . </S>",
    "<S> this must still be transferred to conventional quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the example of coloured annihilons , which have the best prospect of being produced at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the annihilons transform under @xmath68 as @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in order to produce a thermal wimp - like baryon asymmetry , the decay of @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath21 must occur after the baryon asymmetry has frozen out , at @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath20 and @xmath21 must be _ very long - lived _ particles : 1.5 8 10 ^ -11 ( ) ^2 s  , where the upper bound is from nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a key experimental signature of annihilons . </S>",
    "<S> the long annihilon life - time requires either an extremely small renormalizable yukawa coupling @xmath72 to sm fermions @xmath73 with 1.2 10 ^ -10 ( ) ( ) ^1/2  , or a non - renormalizable coupling suppressed by a sufficiently large mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> the former possibility seems overtly unnatural , so we will consider the latter . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case we need to explain why there are no renormalizable couplings leading to rapid @xmath20 decay .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest way to achieve this is if @xmath20 has a large hypercharge e.g. @xmath74 . in this case @xmath20 and @xmath21 can decay only via mass - suppressed non - renormalizable interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the case @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we can form d_r l_l  and e_r^c q_l q_l  . </S>",
    "<S> the mass @xmath77 should then be in the range @xmath78 to account for the low decay temperature @xmath79 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath21 to decay , we must assume that @xmath27 is slightly broken by the non - renormalizable operators . </S>",
    "<S> however , since these operators are suppressed by a large mass scale , this small breaking of @xmath27 will not introduce any dangerous mass mixing between @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> if baryon number is conserved , then from and the baryon numbers and @xmath21 also carry lepton number , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . ] of @xmath20 and @xmath21 would be @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , if we do not assume baryon number conservation , then there are other possible operators , for example ( q_l l_l ) ^  , which allows @xmath20 to decay to a final state with @xmath84 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the effective baryon number of @xmath20 and @xmath21 will be determined by their dominant decay modes </S>",
    "<S> .    1 observation of such unstable particles might be achieved via the decay of particles which are stopped in detectors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the key experimental feature of the baryomorphosis model are the annihilons @xmath20 , @xmath21 :    1 @xmath1 their mass must be 100 gev - few tev to produce weak - strength annihilations @xmath4 good prospect of producing at colliders .    </S>",
