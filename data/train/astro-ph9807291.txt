    "since the classical work of trumpler ( 1930a , b ) produced strong evidence of the existence of interstellar dust , several methods have been devised to try to measure the galactic extinction towards extragalactic objects in a reliable way . in particular",
    ", there is a long history on the use of background galaxies to probe extinction . as early as 1934",
    ", hubble realized that the variation of galaxy number - counts with galactic latitude was well represented by the cosecant law , and was therefore consistent with a layer of absorbing material of equal thickness above and below the galactic plane . in 1958",
    ", holmberg found that the observed colors ( corrected for redshift and internal extinction ) of spirals of different types correlated with galactic latitude . in 1967 ,",
    "shane and wirtanen published the best sample up to that date of galaxy number - counts ; their results showed conclusively that galaxies were clustered , but also that galactic extinction was patchy .",
    "when compared to the colors of globular clusters and early - type field galaxies , the shane - wirtanen number - counts also raised the possibility of neutral or grey extinction ( i.e. , @xmath9 3 ) , especially close to the galactic plane . given that this `` grey '' extinction could be an artifact of comparing total extinction derived from what we can not see with selective extinction ( reddening ) inferred from what we can see , peterson ( 1970 ) used the observed colors and magnitudes of brightest cluster ellipticals in an attempt to measure both extinction and reddening from the same objects .",
    "sandage ( 1973,1975 ) employed the same technique on brightest cluster members and radio galaxies projected on the galactic plane ; he measured @xmath10 3 , but of course the simple fact that he could observe the cluster galaxies indicated that these were regions of low extinction in the plane of the galaxy .    in a series of papers , heiles ( 1976 ) , and",
    "burstein & heiles ( 1978a,1978b ) discussed the relationships between hi column density , the shane - wirtanen galaxy counts , and reddening .",
    "heiles ( 1976 ) also addressed the influence of surface brightness profile and distance ( given the dependence of apparent angular diameter on distance ) on the probability of galaxy detection .",
    "burstein & heiles ( 1978b ) elaborated on the effects of variable background when comparing number - counts ; they also concluded that the ( poisson plus clustering ) variance in the shane - wirtanen number - counts was enough to prevent an accurate determinantion of extinction towards the galactic poles .",
    "the end result of their work was burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , the primary reference for estimating galactic extinction towards extragalactic objects until the recent work of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) using the iras and cobe / dirbe ( diffuse infra red background experiment ) 100 @xmath11 m maps .    also very recently , gonzlez et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter g98 ) have used galaxy counts and colors to measure the total opacity of spiral galaxy disks .",
    "this is technically a much more complicated problem , owing to the crowding and confusion from stars , star clusters , and hii regions in the foreground disk . in order to decouple the effects of confusion from those of extinction",
    ", we developed the `` synthetic field '' method : suitable and properly scaled reference fields ( the hubble deep field , hdf , in the case of g98 ) are added directly into the spiral galaxy images ; the reference frames are attenuated to mimic different amounts of extinction and reddening , until one recovers the same number of simulated galaxies as there are real background galaxies . relative to g98 , this paper is a simpler application of extinction simulations using reference fields .",
    "however , the present work also represents an advance in the treatment of the color information , and also because we use additional reference fields .",
    "in general , the ability to determine total average extinction from galaxy number - counts is limited by clustering , and by the difficulties in assessing completeness .",
    "galaxy colors , on the other hand , are biased towards regions of low opacity ( since observing the galaxies is a pre - condition to measure their colors ) .",
    "however , if it can be safely assumed that the region of interest can be sampled everywhere with field galaxies , it is possible to determine an extinction law from the combination of colors and counts ( g98 ) or , assuming an extinction law _ a priori _ , it is feasible to derive total extinction from the reddening of the galaxies alone .",
    "this is what zaritsky ( 1994 ) attempted to do in the halos of external galaxies , through the comparison of the colors of all background galaxies detected with the colors of galaxies in control fields .",
    "but when field galaxies are thrown in together regardless of type , a new problem emerges : galaxies have a color  magnitude dependence ( tyson 1988 , williams et al .",
    "this means that the color offset has to be measured with respect to samples that have the same magnitude limit as the _ extinction - corrected _ limit of the galaxies detected in the field of interest .",
    "zaritsky ( 1994 ) used a maximum - likelihood method to circumvent this problem .",
    "we have developed a much simpler and more intuitive method to account for the color ",
    "magnitude relation when deriving galactic extinction from the colors of field galaxies .      in this paper , we describe the `` simulated extinction method '' to measure foreground galactic extinction from background field galaxy number - counts and colors .",
    "the method takes into account selection effects , in particular , the change in isophotal detection limit ( and hence in isophotal magnitude completeness limit ) with extinction , and the galaxy color  magnitude relation .",
    "we simulate extinction in suitable reference fields by changing the isophotal detection limit .",
    "the procedure is repeated for different values of extinction . to make use of the cumulative number - counts",
    ", a plot is drawn of the total number of galaxies recovered in each simulation vs.  the assumed extinction in order to ascertain the `` best '' fit to the actual number - counts in the field of interest ( g98 ) . to use the colors",
    ", we measure the difference between the average color of the galaxies in the field of interest , and the average color of the reference galaxies as we change the isophotal detection limit of the latter . note",
    "that we are _ not _ simulating the reddening of the reference fields , just the change of average color with isophotal detection limit ( the galaxy color  magnitude relation ) .",
    "next , we plot the color difference vs.  `` extinction '' , or detection threshold .",
    "the extinction in the field of interest is given by the intersection of this function ( which decreases with extinction or a brighter isophotal detection limit ) with the galactic reddening law .",
    "we present a first application of the method to the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of the gamma - ray burster grb  970228 .",
    "the extinction towards the grb has recently been a matter of contention ( castander & lamb 1998 ) ; in the absence of a measured redshift of the host , the assumed unreddened colors determine the plausibility of the object being in the milky way or extragalactic . as we will show , both galaxy counts and ( assuming a galactic reddening law ; schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) galaxy colors yield independently the same , relatively low ( @xmath12 0.6 mag ) foreground extinction towards the burster .",
    "as discussed elsewhere ( g98 ) , hst wfpc2 images offer a significant advantage over images from ground - based telescopes in their greatly improved resolution , which facilitates the separation of stellar objects from galaxies .",
    "ideally , reference fields should be available with the same camera and range of colors , and at least as deep or deeper in exposure time as the images of interest .",
    "obviously , the extinction towards the reference fields should be known ( or assumed ) . fortunately , there are by now many fields observed with the wfpc2 which can satisfy these criteria , including the medium deep survey fields ( typically exposures of 5000 s in the @xmath0 and @xmath13 passbands ; griffiths et al .  1994 ; ratnatunga , griffiths , & ostrander 1998 ) , the field around the weak radio - galaxy 53w002 ( 24 orbits in 3 colors ; e.g. , pascarelle et al .",
    "1996a , b ) , the two deep westphal fields ( @xmath14 25000 s each in both @xmath0 and @xmath13 ; westphal , kristian , & groth 1994 ) and , of course , the hdf ( 150 orbits in 4 colors , williams et al .  1996 ) , which offers the deepest set of images .",
    "the counts and colors of the galaxies in the reference images should be `` representative '' of galaxies in the field or at least well characterized .",
    "however , this is not as crucial as it might seem ; as discussed in the conclusions to g98 , the relevant quantities for this kind of work are the dispersions of the galaxy number - counts and colors , and not the means .",
    "even if we manage to determine very accurately the means of these properties in a typical wfpc2 reference field , the larger source of error will still be the `` single realization '' of the field that we are investigating . under these circumstances ,",
    "the dispersion is a fair estimator of the expected error in the derived extinction .",
    "for this work , we use as reference fields the hdf , the field around the weak radio - galaxy 53w002 , and the two deep westphal fields . like the data on the grb  970228",
    ", each reference image comprises 3 contiguous  wide  field  camera  fields ,   plus  one   planetary  camera  ( pc )  field  which  we  do   not  use  here .",
    "table 1 lists the equatorial coordinates , galactic coordinates , and exposure times in the @xmath0 and @xmath13 passbands of the reference fields , and of the grb  970228 images as well .",
    "the burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) @xmath15 towards all of the reference fields is basically zero , but we assume @xmath16 , from the systematic offset found by schlegel et al .",
    "we choose to estimate the clustering error from the literature ( roche et al .",
    "1993 ; brainerd et al .",
    "1995 ) , because we would need a much bigger sample of reference wfpc2 fields to measure the error directly from the data .",
    "we use the version 2 release images of the hdf ( williams et al.1996 ) retrieved from the stsci / hst archive .",
    "this release of the hdf was made from dithered  exposures  using  the  `` drizzling ''  method  ( fruchter & hook 1997 ) . the hdf was observed in the 4 photometric bands designated @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath0 , and @xmath13 ( cf .  the hst data handbook ) ; we only use the images in the @xmath0 and @xmath13 passbands for this investigation ( table 1 ) .    like the public release hdf images ,",
    "the wfpc2 images of the fields surrounding grb  970228 and 53w002 , as well as the two westphal fields , were drizzled onto sub - sampled output images ; care was taken to align the @xmath0 and @xmath13 images of each field .",
    "a final output pixel scale of @xmath19 was used , rather than the @xmath20 of the hdf .",
    "( as the hdf was the first application of drizzling , a very conservative pixel scale was used . ) additionally , the images were cleaned of blemishes using the `` blot '' task ( fruchter & hook 1997 ) . since `` blot ''",
    "is only used to produce comparison images for the creation of blemish masks , its use should have no effect on the photometry of the final images .",
    "similarly , we are able to adjust for the effect of the differing pixel scales of the hdf and the other images by altering the source extraction software parameters (  [ extraction ] ) .",
    "when using an isophotal brightness threshold to detect and perform photometry of galaxies , extinction has a double effect .",
    "it will reduce the surface brightness and the total apparent luminosity of the galaxies , of course , but it will also shift a fixed isophotal detection threshold to intrinsically brighter magnitudes . on average , the difference between the measured isophotal magnitudes and the total apparent magnitudes of galaxies will be larger than in the absence of extinction , because the isophotal brightness will be integrated over a smaller area of the galaxy ( shane & wirtanen 1967 ; heiles 1976 ) .",
    "in other words , the differential number - count vs.   apparent magnitude relation will shift towards fainter magnitudes by an amount larger than the extinction .",
    "another problem with comparing differential counts vs.  magnitude in two fields is that they will be influenced ( mainly at brighter magnitudes , where galaxy clustering is worst ) by overdensities associated with particular large scale structures .",
    "a much better approach is to use cumulative counts , taking into account selection effects .",
    "we used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to perform the photometry on all objects in the grb field ,   up  to  the  @xmath21  arcsec@xmath22  isophote  in  @xmath23 .",
    "this threshold is somewhat conservative , but it allowed the detection of most objects that we could identify as galaxies by eye , and at the same time avoided the identification of noise as spurious galaxies .",
    "the source detection , object deblending , and object classification ( stars vs.  galaxies ) were done in the @xmath0 image because it is deeper than the @xmath13 frame ( table 1 ) .",
    "also , fainter field galaxies are statistically bluer , so searching in @xmath0 allows the detection of more objects .",
    "once galaxies had been identified in the @xmath0 data , their ( @xmath0 - @xmath13 ) color was measured in a fixed aperture of 04 diameter (  [ colors ] ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that separation between stars and galaxies is not a serious problem at the resolution and depth of the hst images .",
    "not only the separation on the basis of morphology is easier ; in addition , owing to the finite size of the milky way , at fainter magnitudes the number - counts of galactic stars are drastically reduced .",
    "we have estimated that the error in number - counts introduced by uncertainties in object separation is , at most , @xmath24 , about half of the poisson error .",
    "following closely on the ideas developed in g98 , photometry of galaxies was performed in the control fields at different simulated extinctions , i.e. , at progressively brighter detection thresholds , starting with the 25 @xmath25 arcsec@xmath22 isophote adequate for the grb image , and at intervals of 0.40 mag in @xmath0 ( or 0.45 mag in @xmath26 ; schlegel et al .",
    "this will take into account the dependence of the cumulative number - count vs.  extinction curve on object selection biases . with our procedure",
    ", the higher signal  to  noise ratio of the reference fields ( especially the hubble deep field ) will result in a smaller photometric error , but will have no impact on the number of galaxies detected .",
    "we tested this assumption by adding noise to the hdf , until it had the same signal - to - noise ratio as the grb image ; the search on this degraded image yielded 277 instead of 275 galaxies ( table 2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fcounts ] shows the comparison between the number of galaxies found in the grb  970228 field ( horizontal line ) and the number of `` control '' galaxies recovered in the reference fields at each different simulated extinction .",
    "the actual measurement of the extinction toward the gamma - ray burster field was performed by linearly interpolating between the simulations with numbers of recovered galaxies immediately above and below the number of galaxies in the grb field .",
    "panel 1 compares the galaxies in the field of the burster to the average of all 4 control fields ; panels 2 through 5 show the results for the different reference fields .",
    "the error bars include the poisson counting error and the galaxy clustering error expected from the two - point correlation function @xmath27 on the side .",
    "since the field of view is not square , this slightly overestimates the value of the correlation function . ]",
    "( roche et al .  1993 ; brainerd et al .  1995 ) .",
    "the correlation function depends on the completeness limit of the galaxies ; in the case of the above mentioned references , @xmath28 is measured in the @xmath29-band .",
    "we have used the hdf images to determine the number - count completeness limit to our surface brighteness detection threshold of 25 mag@xmath30 arcsec@xmath22 in @xmath0 . from histograms of differential counts vs.  aperture magnitude in increasingly larger apertures , we find that , in the absence of extinction , the number - counts are complete to a total integrated ab magnitude of 25.5 in @xmath0 .",
    "this is equivalent to an @xmath29 ( apparent ) brightness of @xmath14 25 mag)@xmath30 = 0.5 , that is , the same color as the average of all the reference galaxies to our detection limit , ( @xmath31 ) = 0.4 mag .",
    "reassuringly , according to smail et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , galaxies with a total @xmath29 apparent magnitude between 23.0 and 25.5 have ( @xmath32 ) @xmath14 0.6 mag , or ( @xmath31 ) = 0.4 .",
    "we roundoff these estimates to 0.5 mag , given that the references used for the two - point correlation function provide their measurements in half - magnitude steps .",
    "if anything , this slightly overestimates the expected clustering error . ] . as we change the detection threshold to simulate extinction in the control fields , we move the completeness limit accordingly , towards brighter magnitudes .",
    "table 2 shows , for each reference field and for different simulated extinctions in @xmath26 , the assumed @xmath29 magnitude completeness limit , @xmath27 , and the number of detected galaxies with their total 1@xmath33 error ; in parenthesis , we list separately the poisson counting error and the galaxy clustering uncertainty . due to rotation between the @xmath0 and the @xmath13 observations of the grb  970228 , all the reference fields have an area a few percent larger than that of the grb mosaic ; the number - counts in figure [ fcounts ] and table 2 have been adjusted for these differences .",
    "the bottom part of the table displays the number - counts measured in the grb  970228 field , as well as the extinctions in @xmath26 derived from their comparison against the counts in the control fields .",
    "the quoted extinctions include the additional 0.07 mag in @xmath1 implied by the systematic offset in @xmath15 , relative to burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , found by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . here",
    "also , we give the total error in the derived extinction and , in parenthesis , the error from shot - noise in the number - counts and the contribution to the error from galaxy clustering .    from the average of the number - counts in all the control fields , we measure an extinction of @xmath34 mag .",
    "we notice , however , that the dispersion of the number - counts in the few wfpc2 reference fields we use is about twice the estimated error bars ; for reasons that are yet to be understood , the two westphal fields have fewer galaxies than the hdf and the 53w002 field , by an amount that is significantly larger than the expected clustering error .",
    "comparison of the counts in the grb field with those of the hdf and the 53w002 field gives a best estimate of the extinction of @xmath1 = 0.75@xmath20.24 ; if the two westphal fields are averaged in with the richer fields , and we use the dispersion to estimate the error , the best value of the extinction is @xmath35 mag .",
    "we measured the average colors of the reference galaxies , once again at progressively brighter detection thresholds , starting with the @xmath36 arcsec@xmath22 isophote adequate for the grb image .",
    "following g98 , after identification in the @xmath0 images , we measured the color of each individual galaxy in a fixed aperture , in this case of 04 diameter .",
    "the goal is to avoid contaminating the measured galaxy colors with the color of the sky .",
    "this means that the main effect of the change in detection threshold ( and therefore in isophotal magnitude limit ) is the loss of faint ( statistically bluer ) galaxies .",
    "the error introduced by not measuring possible color gradients over larger galaxy radii should be negligible , especially because the measurement of a color gradient depends very critically on an accurate estimation of the background .",
    "we assume that the error in the mean color is its measured dispersion divided by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of galaxies used for the color measurement .",
    "hdf galaxies ( where @xmath38 is the number of galaxies revcovered at each simulated extinction ) ; we found that the error predicted from bootstrapping statistics is of the same order as the error found by assuming a gaussian distribution . ]    since the errors in the average colors are of the order of 0.05 mag ( table 3 ) , in the simulations we incremented the detection threshold in steps of 0.10 mag in @xmath0 , or 0.11 mag in @xmath26 ( schlegel et al .",
    "we remind the reader that we did _ not _ simulate the reddening of the reference fields , just the change of average color with isophotal detection limit ( the galaxy color  magnitude relation ) .",
    "we then calculated the color difference ( @xmath39 ) in @xmath40 between the reference galaxies and the galaxies in the grb field .",
    "figure [ fcolors ] shows the change in @xmath39 with isophotal detection limit .",
    "panel 1 compares the galaxies in the field of the burster to the average of all 4 control fields ; panels 2 through 5 show the results for each one of the different reference fields .",
    "@xmath39 decreases at brighter detection thresholds ( i.e. , higher extinction ) , due to the color ",
    "magnitude relation shown by field galaxies ( brighter galaxies are statistically redder ) .",
    "the errors are higher at high extinction , both because fewer galaxies are detected and because the intrinsic dispersion in color is higher for apparently brighter galaxies .",
    "figure [ fcolors ] also displays the galactic reddening line , that is , @xmath41 vs.  @xmath1 ( schlegel et al .",
    "the intersection between the two relations measures the foreground galactic extinction @xmath1 towards grb  970228 .",
    "the observed average color of the galaxies in the grb field equals the sum of the control field average color plus the reddening at the inferred extinction ( cf .",
    "table 3 ) .",
    "albeit much simpler , our procedure is equivalent to _ simultaneously _ changing the isophotal detection threshold _ and _ reddening the control galaxies following a galactic extinction law , until their average color is the same as that of the galaxies in the grb field .",
    "this is so because we base the galaxy detection in only one band , and we do not use an upper limit in color as a galaxy selection criterion .",
    "table 3 shows , for each reference field and for different simulated extinctions in @xmath26 , the average color of the galaxies and the difference in color with respect to the galaxies in the grb field .",
    "the bottom of the table displays the measured color of the galaxies in the grb field , and the derived extinctions in @xmath26 from the comparison with the galaxy colors in the reference fields .",
    "accounting as described for the color ",
    "magnitude relation of field galaxies , and assuming a foreground screen galactic reddening law , a comparison between the average colors of , respectively , the control galaxies and the galaxies in the grb field yields @xmath1 = 0.61@xmath20.11 mag ; the error represents the scatter between the measurements obtained from the different control fields .",
    "in contrast to the number - counts , the galaxy colors in all 4 reference fields agree well ; within the errors , the colors of all the fields are the same , at all detection thresholds .",
    "we  have  developed  the  `` simulated  extinction   method '' to measure foreground galactic extinction from the number - counts and colors of field galaxies .",
    "the method simulates extinction in suitable reference fields by changing accordingly the isophotal detection limit .",
    "this procedure allows the calibration of selection effects and systematics , in particular the galaxy color  magnitude relation , and the change in isophotal detection limit with extinction ( and hence the change in both the isophotal magnitudes of galaxies and in the number - count completeness limit ) .",
    "we have used 4 hst wfpc2 reference fields to measure forward galactic extinction towards the field of the gamma - ray burster grb  970228 .",
    "comparison of the counts in the grb field with those of the hdf and the 53w002 field gives a best estimate of the extinction of @xmath1 = 0.75@xmath20.24 ; if the two westphal fields are included , the value of the extinction is @xmath35 mag .",
    "although the counts differ , the average colors of the field galaxies agree well .",
    "the extinction implied by the average color difference between the grb field and the 4 reference fields is @xmath1 = 0.61 mag ; the dispersion in estimated extinction between the 4 reference fields is only 0.11 mag .",
    "however , there may be a slight bias in the value measured from the colors ; if the extinction is clumpy , the most obscured galaxies may fall out of the sample and not affect the average color .",
    "thus the estimate of @xmath1 = 0.61 mag may be a lower limit .",
    "all our measurements are in good agreement with the value of 0.81@xmath20.27 mag obtained by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ; error re - estimated by schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , and with the extinction of 0.78@xmath20.12 mag measured from maps of dust ir emission ( schlegel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "ultimately , all of these estimates are averages with different spatial resolutions and over different components of the ism , at a low latitude position where the milky way exhibits a steep gradient in extinction ( cf .",
    "burstein & heiles 1982 ) ; none of these methods is capable of measuring the extinction in the exact line of sight to the grb .",
    "it is very exciting that the colors of the field galaxies agree so well , despite the big differences in number - counts and even though , for example , there are no clusters at low redshift in the hdf , while the 53w002 field was selected around a weak radio galaxy ( in no case did we try to identify and excise galaxy clusters ) .",
    "moreover , comparison of the extinction - corrected color of the grb host to the ( @xmath42 ) colors of the hdf galaxies ( fruchter et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests that the value of @xmath1 = 0.6 mag derived from the colors might be closest to the correct extinction ; already with the value of @xmath1 = 0.75 mag adopted in that paper , the grb host is as blue as the bluest objects in the hdf .",
    "but although the tightness in the colors is very interesting _ per se _ and from the point of view of their usefulness to probe extinction , the discrepancy between the widely varying counts and the very stable colors in these high - latitude fields is worth investigating .",
    "the 53w002 field has a slightly lower exposure time than the two westphal fields .",
    "this , and the galaxy search performed in the degraded version of the hdf (  [ counts ] ) eliminate the possibility that the discrepancy is caused by the different signal  to  noise ratios of the reference fields .",
    "the disparity occurs across all magnitude bins fainter than 21.5 @xmath23 mag ( isophotal ) , and applying a fainter detection threshold does not really help to reduce it .",
    "we looked at the counts and colors of the reference galaxies when using a surface brightness detection limit of @xmath43 arcsec@xmath22 isophote in @xmath23 ( a threshold set by the 53w002 field , i.e. , the shallowest of the reference images ) .",
    "the colors remain as stable ; the number - counts , on the other hand , start to converge , but not nearly as quickly as the expected clustering error drops .",
    "it is possible that the problem lies in the quoted clustering errors . to our knowledge ,",
    "the field - to - field variance on the scale of the wfpc2 field of view has not been investigated , even on ground - based data .",
    "in fact , the characteristics of fields of the size , spatial resolution , and depth of our reference images are a matter of intense study at present . in this regard , although the properties of the hdf ( villumsen , freudling , & da costa 1997 ) appear to be consistent with those derived for ground - based data ( brainerd et al .",
    "1995 ) , results on other deep fields are not yet available .",
    "the clustering of galaxies brighter than @xmath44 = 23 mag in prerefurbishment wfpc medium deep survey images ( neuschaefer et al .",
    "1995 ) is also consistent with ground - based data ( roche et al .",
    "1993 ) , but the completeness limit of the survey is much brighter than that of the wfpc2 deep fields .    we could also have been too optimistic in our estimate of the completeness limit .",
    "if we disregard the results of the aperture photometry and instead take the view of tyson ( 1988 ) , that the completeness limit of a survey is about two magnitudes brighter than the surface brightness detection threshold , then our number - counts are complete to only @xmath45 22.5 in the absence of extinction .",
    "this will in fact bring our errors in line with the observed dispersion of the data .",
    "it is important to find out whether the westphal fields are outlyers or , conversely , if the observed dispersion in the number - counts reflects the real dispersion between wfpc2 fields .",
    "if the latter is true , the size of the errors severely hampers the precision of extinction measurements derived from galaxy number - counts .",
    "also , studies of the clustering properties of a number of deep wfpc2 fields should determine whether the inadequacy of the estimated clustering errors is real or caused by an overly optimistic completeness limit . finally , even if it sounds improbable , there is of course the possibility that some obscuring material lies in between us and the westphal fields .",
    "it would have to be colder than @xmath14 10 - 15 k to not show up in the 100 @xmath11 m maps ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , but this is not unlikely at high galactic latitude , far from the interstellar uv radiation field ; it would also have to leave the colors of the galaxies unchanged .",
    "the answer to the number - count discrepancy is beyond the scope of this paper , but it will be very interesting , either way .",
    "we acknowledge max mutchler for assistance with the reduction of the grb wfpc2 images .",
    "we are indebted to ron allen and harry ferguson for their very useful comments .",
    "we thank dave schlegel for providing measurements of the reddening towards all the fields we use in this paper , and paul goudfrooij for help with _",

    "<S> this procedure takes into account selection effects , in particular , the change in isophotal detection limit ( and hence in isophotal magnitude completeness limit ) with extinction , and the galaxy color  magnitude relation .    </S>",
    "<S> we present a first application of the method to the hst wfpc2 images of the gamma - ray burster grb  970228 . </S>",
    "<S> four different wfpc2 high - latitude fields , including the hdf , are used as reference to measure the average extinction towards the grb in the @xmath0 passband . from the counts </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an average extinction of @xmath1 = 0.5 mag , but the dispersion of 0.4 mag between the estimates from the different reference fields is significantly larger than can be accounted by poisson plus clustering uncertainties . although the counts differ , the average colors of the field galaxies agree well . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction implied by the average color difference between the grb field and the reference galaxies is @xmath1 = 0.6 mag , with a dispersion in the estimated extinction from the four reference fields of only 0.1 mag . </S>",
    "<S> all our estimates are in good agreement with the value of 0.81@xmath20.27 mag obtained by burstein & heiles , and with the extinction of 0.78@xmath20.12 measured by schlegel et al .  from maps of dust ir emission . </S>",
