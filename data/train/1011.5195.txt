    "nearly eighty years ago , kronig  @xcite and kramers  @xcite discovered a relation between causality and analyticity of a complex refractive index .",

    "this analyticity is generally referred to as dispersion relation .",
    "kronig  @xcite then proved that the dispersion relation is the necessary and sufficient condition for the causality condition to be satisfied .",
    "since then , the dispersion relation has been generalized and used in may branches of physics  @xcite . in non - relativistic quantum physics , schutzer and",
    "tiomno  @xcite derived a dispersion relation of a s - matrix element for the scattering of particles by a finite range scatterer ; their causality condition was that the out - going scattered wave must be zero for all times before the in - going incident wave hits the scattering center .",
    "this work was criticized and generalized by van kampen  @xcite , and its even more general derivation was given later by wigner  @xcite . in relativistic quantum physics ,",
    "gell - mann , goldberger , and thirring  @xcite derived a dispersion relation of s - matrix elements from their causality condition , called microscopic causality , that the commutator ( or anticommutator for fermions ) of two heisenberg field operators taken at space - like points vanish .",
    "this has been provided a non - perturbative method for relativistic quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "our article presents yet another dispersion relation in quantum physics , a dispersion relation that the wave functions satisfy in the energy representation .",
    "the causality condition we employ here is the quantum physics version of `` cause and effect '' discussed in detail by ludwig  @xcite and his school .",
    "it is called _ the preparation - registration arrow of time _",
    "@xcite : `` a state must be prepared first by a preparation apparatus before an observable can be detected in it by the registration apparatus . '' on applying this causality condition",

    "'' we shall here accept this limitation as a phenomenological principle , in place of the `` collapse of the wave function '' axiom in theories of measurement .",

    "this boundary condition is provided by a pair of hardy rigged hilbert spaces .",

    "[ fig : prepreg ] , microsystems are first prepared by a preparation apparatus ( e.g. , accelerator ) and are then subjected to a registration apparatus ( e.g. , detector ) .",
    "a result of experiment , that is a relation between preparation and registration , is described by quantum mechanics .",
    "performing preparation under the same condition would result in an _ ensemble _ of microsystems .",
    "this ensemble is most generally represented as a quantum state which is described by a density operator @xmath7 .",

    "the preparation - registration arrow of time we shall discuss now is a general statement about `` cause and effect '' whose application is not necessarily restricted to a microsystem ; it could equally be applied to any `` large '' object which obeys the laws of classical physics . in quantum physics",

    "this principle given by dirac we now quote : `` causality applies only to a system which is left undisturbed .",

'' as a consequence , the best we can expect for the observations ( measurements ) are probability predictions . in accordance with these phenomenological consideration , we conclude that _ a description of a causal connection by the dynamical equations is possible only between two successive measurements , the preparation of the state and the registration of the observable , during which the microsystem is left undisturbed .",
    "_ once a microsystem is prepared in a state , any previous information about this microsystem is destroyed , and hence it is impossible to trace the system back with the dynamical equations to a time before the state was prepared .    to express this phenomenological principle in a mathematical form ,",

    "one obtains an ensemble of preparation events at @xmath27 , that we refer to _ the ensemble of beginnings of time _  @xcite .",
    "since this ensemble describes the times at which the same state @xmath13 is prepared , all of these times must be mapped onto exactly the same point @xmath28 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebot ] .",

    ".   would be the same on the experimenters clock but the @xmath24 individual microsystems may be at different location but otherwise the same . then @xmath32 at the other extreme , one can work with only one single microsystem and repeat the preparation to the state @xmath13 for @xmath24 times .",
    "examples of this latter case are the single - ion experiments  @xcite , where the microsystem ( a single ion ) is prepared in an unstable state at @xmath33 times . in such an experiment , preparation events take place at _ different _ times as @xmath34 but again they are all mapped onto @xmath2 .",

    "this means that the boundary condition for the schrdinger equation   must be chosen such that its general solution is given by    @xmath49    [ eq : causaltimeevolution ]    such a time evolution   is called _ semigroup _ , because the time evolution operator @xmath50 of the state vector has no inverse @xmath51 .",
    "the solutions of the schrdinger equation depend upon boundary condition , i.e. , the conditions that which space the solutions @xmath52 of the dynamical equation   must belong to . in order to obtain eq .",
    ", one has to use a boundary condition which leads to a semigroup time evolution .      under the hilbert space boundary condition ( or the hilbert space axiom of the standard ( axiomatic ) quantum mechanics )",

    "the impossibility of hilbert space vectors @xmath52 with the property that @xmath59 as would be the case for @xmath60 given by eq .  , is also the consequence of a mathematical theorem  @xcite .",
    "thus , although the hilbert space has been a successful choice for eigenstates of discrete energy which have trivial time evolution ( stationary states ) , it does not accommodate the semigroup time evolution   derived from the phenomenological causality condition we employed .",
    "now we show that one can formulate _ the time asymmetric boundary condition _",
    "@xcite for the time symmetric differential equation   and that it leads to the semigroup time evolution .",

    "the transition amplitude @xmath193 is therefore determined by singularities , e.g. , poles , of the s - matrix element @xmath186 in the lower - half plane . thus the s - matrix elements are responsible for the dynamics of microsystem  @xcite .",

    "this has lead to semigroup time evolutions of states and observables .",
    "the semigroups have been achieved by choosing time - asymmetric boundary conditions , a pair of hardy rigged hilbert spaces ( rhss ) for both schdinger and heisenberg pictures , to integrate the dynamical equations .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly present some of the properties of hardy functions  @xcite relevant to this article .    the hardy function from above @xmath194 and the from below @xmath195 are analytic functions satisfying the following square - integrability : @xmath196 where @xmath197 depends on a particular form of the function @xmath198 .",
    "this is necessary and sufficient condition for the hilbert transform to hold ,        this relation explicitly shows that a hardy function has both nonzero real and imaginary parts , i.e. , can not take a pure real or pure imaginary value , otherwise zero on the entire real line .",
    "the complex conjugate of the hardy function from above ( below ) is the hardy function from below ( above ) , i.e. , @xmath200 .",
    "one can generate hardy functions out of a square - integrable functions @xmath201 which vanish for negative values of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath202 holds , @xmath203 the paley - wiener theorem of hardy function states that hardy function from above @xmath204 on the real axis is obtained from the fourier transform of @xmath201 as @xmath205 the hardy function from above is quite common in signal processing and physics , and sometimes referred to as _ causal transform _  @xcite . from eq .",
    ", hardy function from below is immediately obtained by taking its complex conjugate as @xmath206 . by the titchmarsh theorem of hardy function ,",
    "these functions are guaranteed to be analytic , in the upper half plane for @xmath194 and in the lower half plane for @xmath195 , as @xmath207 thus one obtains various hardy functions by performing the integral   for various @xmath201 . following are two simple examples :    * for @xmath208 , one obtains @xmath209 the square modulus of this hardy function is a lorentzian function . * for @xmath210 , one obtains @xmath211 this hardy function has been used in classical electrodynamics to describe the propagation of light in a dispersive medium  @xcite , where the physics terminology `` dispersion relations '' for eq .",
