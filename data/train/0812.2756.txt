    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are commonly observed at the centers of nearby galaxies , and the existence of quasars at redshifts @xmath5 implies that many of these smbhs reached nearly their current masses at very early times .",
    "bright galaxies are believed to form via hierarchical merging of smaller galaxies , and galaxy mergers lead inevitably to the formation of binary smbhs ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ) . at their formation ,",
    "such smbh binaries typically have separations @xmath6 , where    @xmath7    ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this `` hard binary separation '' @xmath8 is defined in the standard way as the value of the binary semi - major axis at which passing stars are ejected with velocities high enough to unbind them from the smbhs ; @xmath8 is a function of the binary reduced mass @xmath9 and the ambient stellar velocity dispersion @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "at least one binary smbh has probably been observed , with a projected separation of about @xmath12pc @xcite .",
    "the quasi - periodic outbursts of the quasar oj287 have also plausibly been modeled as a binary system with separation @xmath13 pc and eccentricity @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a few other galactic systems are known to contain dual smbhs with separations of a few kiloparsec , presumably the precursors of binary smbhs @xcite .",
    "binary smbhs may eventually coalesce , but only after stellar- and/or gas - dynamical processes have first brought the two smbhs to separations small enough ( @xmath15pc ) that gravitational wave emission is effective .",
    "whether nature typically succeeds in overcoming this `` final parsec problem , '' or whether long - lived binary smbhs are the norm , is currently unknown .",
    "persistence of the binaries would have a number of potentially important consequences , including ejection of smbhs from galaxy nuclei via three - body interactions and a reduction in the mean ratio of smbh mass to galaxy mass ( volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , plans to detect gravitational waves from the final inspiral of binary smbhs by space - based observatories such the laser interferometer space antennae ( lisa ) ( sesana , volonteri & haardt 2007 ) might need to be re - considered if evolution of the binaries typically stalls at large separations .    in a spherical , gas - free galaxy ,",
    "the evolution of a binary smbh slows down at separations of @xmath16 because stars on orbits that intersect the binary  so - called `` loss - cone orbits ''  are depleted in just a few galaxy crossing times ( e.g. , begelman et al .",

    "binary can continue to evolve in such a galaxy only if the loss - cone orbits are somehow repopulated .",
    "gravitational scattering is one possible mechanism for loss - cone repopulation , but it is only effective in low - luminosity galaxies with central relaxation times below @xmath17gyr @xcite .",
    "dense concentrations of gas can substantially accelerate the evolution of a massive binary by increasing the drag on the individual smbhs @xcite .",
    "the plausibility of such gas accumulations , with masses comparable to the masses of the smbhs , is unclear however , particularly in the most massive galaxies .",
    "galaxy merger simulations including gas have followed the two smbhs until separations of a few tens of parsecs , roughly the hard binary separation @xcite .",
    "these simulations contain useful information about the formation and early evolution of smbh binaries but  at least so far  do not have the resolution needed to address the final parsec problem .",
    "an alternative pathway exists for binary smbhs to evolve beyond @xmath6 , even in gas - free galaxies with long relaxation times .",
    "if the galaxy potential is non - axisymmetric , many of the stars will be on centrophilic orbits , i.e. , orbits that pass near the center of the galaxy once per orbital period @xcite . if even a small fraction of a galaxy s mass is associated with such orbits , the `` feeding '' rate of a central binary can be enormously enhanced compared with the rates in spherical galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored this pathway in @xmath0-body simulations containing particle numbers up to one million ; the initial galaxy models were rotating , and in some cases the rotation was rapid enough to induce the formation of a triaxial bar .",
    "evolution of the smbh binary was observed not to stall at @xmath6 in the triaxial models ; furthermore the evolution rates exhibited no discernible dependence on particle number , as predicted if the mechanism of loss - cone refilling is collisionless . to date , the @xcite simulations are the only ones that have successfully followed the evolution of a binary smbh all the way from galactic to sub - parsec scales , and that can robustly be scaled to real galaxies due to the lack of an appreciable @xmath0-dependence of the evolution rates .    the final binary separation in the @xcite simulations was @xmath18 , just small enough that gravitational wave emission would induce coalescence in @xmath19gyr ( assuming a scaling that assigns a mass @xmath20 to the binary smbh ) . in this paper , we repeat the berczik et al .",
    "simulations using a new @xmath0-body code that incorporates the post - newtonian ( @xmath1  ) corrections to the equations of motion of the smbhs .",
    "this allows us to follow the evolution of the binary all the way to final coalescence .",
    "in addition , we are able to estimate the strength of the gravitational waves emitted during the final inspiral .",
    "a key result is that the eccentricity of the binary can remain high until shortly before coalescence .",
    "both the strength of the emitted gravitational waves , and the timescale for coalescence , are strongly dependent on the binary eccentricity .",
    "highly eccentric black hole binaries would represent appropriate candidates for forthcoming verification of gravitational radiation through the planned mission of lisa .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  2 we give a description of the numerical methods and initial models used in this work . in section",
    "3 we then present the results of a set of @xmath0-body simulations using both the classical , i.e. , newtonian gravity ( sec .  3.1 ) and the relativistic , i.e. , post - newtonian gravity ( sec .",
    "3.2 ) . in section  4",
    "we discuss our results in a broader astrophysical context , focusing on the smbh merger as sources of gravitational wave emission .",
    "in section  5 we finish with the conclusions .",
    "for the @xmath0-body simulations presented in this work we use a modified version of the publicly available @xmath21-grape code @xcite . this code is based on an nbody1-like algorithm @xcite , including a hierarchical timestep scheme and a @xmath22-order hermite integrator ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the gravitational acceleration @xmath23 and its first time - derivative @xmath24 ( also called : jerk ) between the _ field _ particles  representing the stellar component in the galactic nucleus  are calculated using the special - purpose hardware grape-6a ( fukushige , makino & kawai 2005 ) .",
    "we also use the grape hardware to calculate the interaction between the field particles and the black holes ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the acceleration between the two black hole ( bh ) particles , the corresponding jerk as well as the relativistic corrections , are all calculated using the hosts cpu .    to determine the timestep bin for each individual particle we use the standard criterium @xcite of the form :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the acceleration , its first and @xmath28 time - derivatives , respectively , of a given particle @xmath29 . for details on how to obtain the higher - order time - derivatives we refer to @xcite .",
    "whereas we use @xmath30 for the field particles , we use a smaller @xmath31 for the two bh particles in order to guarantee an adequate conservation of energy and momentum ( in the newtonian gravity simulations ) .",
    "moreover , the two bhs are always advanced synchronously using the smaller @xmath32 of the two .",
    "the simulations have been carried out on the dedicated high - performance grape-6a clusters at the astronomisches rechen - institut in heidelberg , at the rochester institute of technoloy , and at the main astronomical observatory in kiev .",
    "the initial conditions of the @xmath0-body models used in this work are chosen to be similar to the ones used by berczik et al . @xcite and @xcite , allowing for a direct comparison to their simulations and for an accordant interpretation of our results . here",
    ", we briefly describe the main aspects of the initial model set - up and refer the reader to the latter two publications ( and references therein ) for further details .    the initial field particle distribution  representing the galactic nucleus  is set - up following the phase - space density distribution of a king model @xcite with internal rotation ( e.g. , * ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the models have been set up with a central concentration parameter of @xmath33 and an initial rotation of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the gravitational constant and the central concentration , respectively . the net rotation in our models is chosen to be counter - clockwise , with the angular momentum vector being aligned with the @xmath37-axis .",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath0-body units ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) to our numerical models by setting both the gravitational constant @xmath35 and the total mass @xmath38 of the @xmath0-body system to unity , and by setting its total energy to @xmath39 .    in this work the galactic nucleus is represented with total numbers of @xmath40 and @xmath41 field particles , respectively , each with nine different random realizations .",
    "we restrict ourselves to these relatively small particle numbers as a trade - off for the large set of simulations that we have performed in grand total . however , as @xcite have shown , the hardening rate of smbh binaries in such rotating galaxy models is in this regime essentially independent of the field particle number @xmath42 .",
    "the main difference between our models and the latter ones is the @xmath1 treatment of the two smbhs .",
    "therefore the results of our simulations are expected to be quasi-@xmath0-independent as well , since we use a rotation parameter of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the field particles have all equal mass @xmath44 .",
    "the gravitational softening length for the field particles has been set to @xmath45 ( in model units ) . the same softening is also used for the star@xmath46bh interaction .",
    "the two bh particles themselves are evolved without any gravitational softening , i.e. , with @xmath47 .",
    "we set the masses @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the two bh particles to be one per cent of the nuclei mass @xmath38 , i.e. , in our case @xmath50 .",
    "the two bh particles are initially placed on the @xmath51-axis at @xmath52 , respectively , within the @xmath53 plane .",
    "the bhs are given an initial velocity @xmath54 , corresponding to roughly ten per cent of the local circular velocity , as derived from the enclosed mass of the underlying field particle distribution .",
    "with this we get roughly @xmath55 , in our model units .",
    "note that in this configuration the two black holes are initially unbound with respect to each other .    to scale our @xmath0-body results to real galaxies we consider the total energy of the system    @xmath56    where @xmath35 , @xmath57 are the gravitational constant and the total mass of our model system ( typically some fraction of the bulge and cusp components in a galactic nucleus ) , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 are model dependent quantities , giving a scaling radius and a numerical constant of order unity , respectively . as an example , for a non - rotating king model with @xmath33 ( which is used in our models as an initial configuration ) we would have @xmath60 as the core radius as defined by @xcite and @xmath61 .    with @xmath62",

    "super - massive black hole binaries are expected to be subject to the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "since the gravitational waves drain energy and angular momentum from the binary , its orbital elements will change in the course of their dynamical evolution .",
    "already more than four decades ago @xcite and @xcite derived the change of energy @xmath81 and of the orbital elements for a keplerian orbit , namely its semi - major axis @xmath82 and eccentricity @xmath83 , under the influence of the gravitational wave ( quadrupole ) emission .",

    "hence , compact binaries with high eccentricities ( i.e. , small @xmath82 and @xmath87 ) are expected to be strong sources of gravitational waves .",
    "the equations of peters & mathews describe the shrinking of the semi - major axis ( corresponding to an inspiral of the two objects ) and the circularization of the orbit . according to @xcite and @xcite the typical timescale of coalescence due to the emission of gravitational radiation",
    "is given by    @xmath88    where @xmath89 denotes the characteristic separation for gravitational wave emission .    to account for the relativistic effects in our numerical @xmath0-body simulations we use the post - newtonian formalism .",
    "the equations of motion for a compact binary system are written in harmonic coordinates @xcite and are defined in the inertial @xmath0-body frame of reference .",
    "as they are relativistic , they are ( 1 ) invariant under @xmath1-expanded lorentz transformations , ( 2 ) reduce to the geodesics of the @xmath1-expanded schwarzschild metric in the limit in which one of the masses goes to zero and neglecting the spin , and ( 3 ) are conservative if the @xmath90  radiation reaction term is turned - off .",
    "in fact , an isolated @xmath4 binary should conserve its generalized @xmath1 integrals of motion up to @xmath91 @xcite .",

    "it actually turns out that certain binaries characteristics , such as the time when the binary forms ( @xmath109 ) , as well as its orbital elements , are very sensitive to the initial conditions of the stellar distribution .",
    "since the eccentricity of the binary is a crucial quantity for its subsequent evolution towards relativistic inspiral and coalescence , it is important to obtain a statistical sample .",

    "both simulations shown in these figures start with identical initial conditions and only differ by the orders of @xmath1 corrections taken into account .    at early times , the dynamical evolution of the binary is qualitatively very similar as compared to the evolution in our purely newtonian simulations ( see figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig4 ] ) : the two bh particles are rapidly driven towards the nuclei center by dynamical friction and the triaxial bar - structure in the stellar nucleus .",
    "the black holes form a pair at roughly @xmath147 ( or some @xmath148myr , correspondingly ) . following the results and interpretation of @xcite , the initially full loss - cone around the black hole binary",
    "is quickly depleted and the evolution of the hard binary thereafter takes place in the empty loss - cone regime . due to the internal rotation and the triaxial structure of the nucleus",
    "the loss - cone is re - populated constantly by centrophilic orbits with a rate which is found to be independent of the number of field particles in the model .    during this phase the binary evolution",

    "[ fig5 ] ) and @xmath151 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "more generally , we find that the time of transition from the newtonian dominated regime to the one in which relativistic effects are of about the same order , depends strongly on the ( mean ) eccentricity @xmath116 of the binary s orbit .",
    "this result is not surprising since as we have already stated before , the dissipation rate due to gravitational wave emission becomes already important at earlier times for more eccentric binaries .    finally , at about times @xmath152 and @xmath153 for figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , respectively , the rate of energy loss increases significantly due to the emission of gravitational waves and becomes very non - linear .",
    "the loss of orbital energy and angular momentum due to the @xmath90 corrections leads to the inspiral and circularization of the orbit , and the binary s dynamics in this phase is dominated by the relativistic effects , i.e. , the binary almost fully completely decouples from the surrounding nucleus .",
    "it is noteworthy that these are the first systematic astrophysical @xmath0-body simulations which actually follow the evolution of the supermassive black holes from their unbound state , i.e. with order kpc separation , down to the sub - parsec scale close to relativistic coalescence and thus overcome the final parsec problem self - consistently .",
    "it seems that the origin of the latter problem partly has been the use of over - simplified models for the galactic nuclei , i.e. , assuming spherically symmetric distributions without ( net ) angular momentum .",

    "our initial conditions are still special but plausible : a `` young '' galactic merger remnant is represented by a flattened , rotating stellar nucleus with the two smbhs at a separation of initially some @xmath154 pc .",
    "this is a more general class of initial models than used in most other papers on the subject @xcite .",
    "this could be seen as one possible solution of the long - standing final parsec problem for black hole mergers @xcite , as in this class of models we find convergence in the hardening rates at low @xmath0 .",
    "this is the result of a dynamical regime where the supply of the stars into the loss - cone region is essentially collisionless and presumably guaranteed by a family of centrophilic orbits associated with this non - spherical potential ( cf .",
    "sections 1.1 and 5 ) .    in the following we discuss in further depth some dynamical properties of our models and observational consequences of our results for gravitational wave instruments .",
    "we have performed of order @xmath143 different simulations , varying the initial data ( statistical realization , particle numbers ) and different physical scalings ( speed of light , different @xmath1 orders ) . in all models that include the @xmath1 equations of motion for the black holes we are able to follow the binaries evolution down to the relativistic inspiral and virtually to coalescence . based on our simulations",
    "we find that inclusion of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 corrections , which have been neglected in most earlier works ( again with the notable exception of @xcite ) , strongly affects the dynamical evolution of the binary .",
    "[ rnda ] shows this , where we directly compare the evolution of @xmath155 and eccentricity as a function of time for two otherwise equal models with full @xmath1 and @xmath90 corrections only , respectively .",
    "the time of coalescence differs by almost a factor of two between these two cases .",
    "we find that part of the reason for this diverging behavior is the different eccentricity with which the binary forms .",
    "using full @xmath1 corrections rather than only @xmath90 changes the details of the binary s trajectory already during their first encounters .",
    "consequently later on , the binary forms with different orbital elements . since all close encounters in the system  up to the one leading to the binary formation  are stochastic ( due to the dynamical instability of close few - body encounters ) we do do not find any preferred systematic trend in our models towards higher or lower eccentricities between the two types of simulations as a function of the type of @xmath1 corrections used .      in fig .",
    "[ ebin ] we show the distribution of eccentricities @xmath116 obtained from the sample of all our simulations .",
    "it clearly shows that the binaries form preferentially with very high eccentricities .",
    "this is favored by the transient triaxial feature in our models ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) which brings the two black holes together with relatively small impact parameter .",
    "since galactic mergers lead dominantly to the formation of stellar bars or other triaxial configurations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect that high eccentricities in smbh binaries after galactic mergers are a robust phenomenon occurring in many real cases .",
    "furthermore , the merger of spherical models of galactic nuclei along nearly - parabolic trajectories also leads to the formation of smbh binaries with a similar distribution of high eccentricities @xcite .",
    "it is known that during the relativistic inspiral , emission of gws leads to the circularization of the binary @xcite . in the same fig .",
    "[ ebin ] , we therefore also show the ( shaded ) histogram for the binary s eccentricities when their semi - major axis has fallen down to @xmath156 schwarzschild radii @xmath157 , for the runs with the realistic values of @xmath158 .",
    "we can clearly see that , although circularization has substantially reduced the binaries eccentricity , the remaining distribution at such small separation is still significantly different from zero . since the orbital eccentricity of the binaries is very important to predict gravitational waveforms from these binaries , and the expected distribution of their orbital parameters strongly determines the complexity of the data analysis for gravitational wave instruments such as the planned lisa satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are currently generalizing the present study to a wider range of more realistic initial conditions .",
    "it may be interesting to note that this type of statistics provides an astrophysically motivated set of initial conditions for numerical relativity simulations of smbh binary mergers . during the last couple of years several groups have made significant progress in modeling black hole mergers by the solution of the full einstein equations and of numerical - relativity simulations ( cf .",

    "[ secpn ] we can distinguish three dynamical phases of smbh binary evolution : ( 1 ) newtonian phase , ( 2 ) mixed phase and ( 3 ) relativistic phase .",
    "it is thus interesting to see how much time a binary will spend the corresponding separations . in fig .",

    "[ statt2 ] we then plot @xmath163 as a function of the orbital eccentricity .",
    "while the smbh binaries with high eccentricity tend to have larger @xmath164 , the fitted slope of the double logarithmic plot of @xmath164 vs. @xmath165 is @xmath166 .",
    "we conclude therefore that the average pericenter @xmath167 of the smbh orbit at any given average @xmath164 has a remarkably small variation , i.e. , is nearly constant .",
    "therefore  to first order  the orbits of smbh binary in our models form a one - parameter family .",
    "this result is relevant and interesting for the determination of gravitational wave backgrounds in the ultra - low and low - frequency areas from smbh binaries in the universe : eccentric smbh binaries emit gravitational waves with a spectrum of frequencies @xmath168 , where @xmath169 denotes the higher harmonics over the basic mode of the circular orbit ( see appendix ) .",
    "the harmonic which leads to the maximal emission of gravitational waves @xmath170 is for high eccentricities ( @xmath171 ) completely determined by the frequency of motion at pericenter @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "thus for every value of average semi - major axis @xmath164 there exists a typical pericenter value and thus a typical gravitational wave spectrum .",

    "the interpretation of these numbers is that for small semi - major axes @xmath82 and high eccentricities the two smbhs basically directly plunge , while for larger @xmath82 and moderate @xmath83 the relativistic timescale becomes unreasonable large .",
    "the evolution and hardening of the binary in such case would therefore mainly be driven by the newtonian stellar - dynamics over some time period .",

    "would then equally be driven by both the classical newtonian and the relativistic effects , before the latter eventually takes over , i.e. , when the binary dynamically decouples from the stellar background .",

    "it takes the binaries to form a bound pair in the simulations our results agree ( within the error limits ) with the _ theoretical _ value .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that the merging time increases with increasing values of @xmath70 , since the relativistic corrections decrease for simulations starting with the same configuration . however , since the hardening rate due to super - elastic scattering with the binary is found to be constant in our simulations , we expect an upper limit of @xmath180 of roughly @xmath181 time units .",
    "it is important to note that in all our simulations the two black hole coalesce in less then @xmath113gyr after they have formed a bound pair !",
    "therefore we conclude that our results provide a dynamical substantiation to the picture of prompt smbh coalescence advocated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , we should also note that these times for black hole coalescences are of the same order as the average interval between consecutive mergers ( cf .",

    "such timescales make it unlikely that there is enough time for a third black hole to interact with the binary before it has coalesced .",
    "if three - body interactions between smbhs were the norm , then it would be quite difficult to understand the notably small amount of scatter in the @xmath183 relation , as well as the scarcity of observational evidence for off - centered nuclei .",
    "note , however , that some fraction of triple interactions of smbhs may be present in the universe and could cause extremely large eccentricities ( e.g. through kozai oscillations ) and become visible through pulsar timing or even in the lower lisa band at comparatively large separations ( orbital time scales ) @xcite .",
    "merger events of smbh binaries are expected to be one of the brightest possible sources of gravitational wave emission to be detected by lisa @xcite : the laser interferometer space antenna , a proposed space - borne gravitational wave observatory , scheduled for launch in 2018 + , is most sensitive to gravitational waves in the low - frequency regime ( @xmath80  @xmath184hz ) ; for smbhs of more than about @xmath185 lisa will preferentially detect the final merger and ringdown phases @xcite , while for smaller masses earlier evolutionary phases of smbh evolution will become detectable in the lisa band , in particular for eccentric smbhs ( see discussion and references in sect .",

    "black hole binaries in this mass regime , however , will inspiral with frequencies even lower than those of the lisa band and thus would not be detectable by lisa before their actual coalescence .    in order to follow the black hole binary inspiral up to frequencies in range of interest for lisa , i.e , @xmath190 hz , we first need to rescale our models to binary masses of order of @xmath191 or @xmath192 m@xmath187 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the speed of light in model units scales as @xmath193 , where @xmath58 and @xmath57 are the units for length - scale and mass , respectively . since",

    "the system at the redshift @xmath195 , where lisa s detection rate for objects of that mass range is expected to be significant .    before actually calculating the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave signal ,",
    "we increase the time - resolution of our output data for the black hole s trajectory during the late phases of inspiral .",
    "this is done by evolving the binary in isolation , starting with initial conditions ( in the binaries center of mass frame ) as given from the large - scale simulations at a stage when it is already decoupled from the surrounding stellar system , i.e. , when the binary evolution is dominated by relativistic dynamics ( compare fig .",

    "the smbh binaries in our simulations often form with large eccentricities , and these high eccentricities are maintained during the newtonian phases of the evolution .",
    "we show that the gravitational wave signal measured by an interferometer like lisa would contain significant contributions from high - order harmonics from gws emitted from binaries at cosmological distances , and that the nature of the signal can depend strongly on the dynamical history of the binary prior to its entering the gravitational wave dominated regime .",
    "we have shown that supermassive black hole binaries in galactic nuclei can overcome the stalling barrier and will reach the relativistic coalescence phase in a timescale shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "a gravitational wave signal expected for the lisa satellite from these smbh binaries is expected , in particular due to the high eccentricity of the smbh binary when entering the relativistic coalescence phase .",
    "we present for the first time a comprehensive set of models which cover self - consistently the transition from the newtonian dynamics , dynamical friction phase ( with yet unbound smbh binary ) to the situation when relativistic , post - newtonian corrections start to influence the relative smbh motion . after the shrinking time scale becomes very short the binary decouples from the rest of the galactic nucleus and can be treated as a relativistic two - body problem .",
    "we follow this evolution formally to the coalescence of the two black holes using @xmath1 terms of up to order @xmath90 and determine the gravitational wave emission in different modes relative to the lisa sensitivity curve .",
    "we find that the orbital parameters of a smbh binary , when entering the lisa band , depends on the previous dynamical history - in particular there exists a phase where the smbh binary is still partially coupled to the stellar environment via three - body encounters , but relativistic corrections to its two - body motion already play a role .    since purely newtonian models of smbh binaries in rotating galactic nuclei @xcite have shown a quasi-@xmath0-independence of the stellar - dynamical driven hardening rates ,",
    "we conclude that the results obtained in this paper regarding the time required until relativistic merger holds for galactic nuclei with realistic parameters . in this work we limited ourselves to models with particle numbers up",
    "to @xmath103k only , however , due to the independence of the results in the newtonian phase from @xmath0 in the current work and in @xcite , we do not expect any significant changes in our main results for models with @xmath205k .",

    "therefore our conclusion from this work can only be that it is possible to reach relativistic coalescence in a reasonable time ( @xmath206 years ) .",
