    "we introduced in @xcite a general method to describe the asymptotic evolution of one - parameter families of continuous - time markov chains .",
    "this method has been succesfully applied in two situations : for zero - range dynamics on a finite set which exhibit condensation @xcite , and for random walks evolving among random traps @xcite . in the first model",
    "the chain admits a finite number of ground sets , while in the second one there is a countable number of ground states .",
    "we start in this paper the investigation of a third case , where the limit dynamics is a continuous process .",
    "this article has two purposes . on the one hand , to derive some estimates needed in the proof of the convergence , in the zero - temperature limit , of the two - dimensional kawasaki dynamics for the ising model in a large cube to a brownian motion , presented in @xcite . on the other hand , to illustrate the interest of the method introduced in @xcite by applying it in a simple context .",
    "a first step was done in this direction in @xcite , where we derived the asymptotic behavior of continuous - time markov chains evolving on a _ fixed _ and _ finite _ state space imposing only one simple condition on the jump rates .",
    "a second step is performed here , applying the result obtained in @xcite to the kawasaki dynamics for the ising model on a fixed two - dimensional square with periodic boundary condition .    to present the main result of @xcite , consider a one - parameter family of irreducible markov chains @xmath9 on a fixed and finite state space @xmath10 , reversible with respect to a probability measure @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the glauber or the kawaski dynamics for the ising model on a finite space .",
    "for @xmath12 , denote by @xmath13 the distribution of the process @xmath14 starting from @xmath15 . expectation with respect to @xmath13 is represented by @xmath16 .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the jump rates of the chain and assume that for all @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21\\ ] ] in the sense that the limit exists with @xmath22 as a possible value .",
    "note that conditions ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) in @xcite follow from .",
    "moreover , since for the glauber or for the kawasaki dynamics the jump rates are either @xmath23 or @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , assumption is fulfilled .    under the elementary assumption we completely described in @xcite the asymptotic evolution of the markov chain @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , we proved the existence of a rooted tree whose vertices are subsets of the state space .",
    "the tree fulfills the following properties : ( a ) the root of the tree is the state space ; ( b ) the subsets of each generation form a partition of the state space ; and ( c ) the sucessors of a vertex are subsets of this vertex .",
    "to each generation corresponds a tunneling behavior .",
    "let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , be the number of generations of the tree , let @xmath28 be the number of descendents at generation @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and let @xmath31 be the vertices of the generation @xmath29 .",
    "we proved the existence of time scales @xmath32 such that for each @xmath30 :    1 .",
    "for every @xmath33 and every state @xmath15 in @xmath34 , @xmath35 \\;=\\ ; 0\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and where @xmath37 stands for the hitting time of a set @xmath38 .",

    "we apply this result to investigate the zero - temperature limit of the kawasaki dynamics for the ising model on a two - dimensional square with periodic boundary condition . here , for a fixed square and a fixed number of particles , we derive the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics among the ground states , configurations whose particles form squares . in @xcite , we show that the evolution of these square configurations converges to a brownian motion when the lenght of the square and the number of particles increase with the inverse of the temperature .",
    "the problem of describing the asymptotic behavior of a one - parameter family of markov chains evolving on a fixed and finite state space has been considered before . olivieri and scoppola @xcite applied the ideas introduced in the pathwise approach to metastability @xcite to this context .",

    "a subset @xmath64 of the state space @xmath10 is called a cycle if @xmath65 , where @xmath66 stands for the outer boundary of @xmath64 : @xmath67 . under condition ,",
    "olivieri and scoppola proved that the exit time of a cycle , appropriately renormalized , converges to an exponential random variable , and they obtained estimates , with exponential errors , for the expectation of the exit time .",
    "they were also able to describe the exit path from a cycle .",
    "these results were generalized by olivieri and scoppola @xcite to the non reversible case , and by manzo et al .",
    "@xcite , who extended the results proved in @xcite for the exit time of a cycle to the hitting time of the absolute minima of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , in the context of a fixed and finite state space , the approach proposed in @xcite requires weaker assumptions on the jump rates than the pathwise approach , it provides better estimates on the exit times of the wells , and it characterizes the transition probabilities which describe the way the process jumps from one well to another . on the other hand , and in contrast with the pathwise approach to metastability , it does not attempt to characterize the exit paths from a well .    the potential theoretic approach to metastability @xcite has also been tested @xcite in the framework of a fixed and finite state space markov chain .",
    "bovier and manzo considered a hamiltonian @xmath63 and an irreducible discrete - time jump probability reversible with respect to the gibbs measure associated to the hamiltonian @xmath63 at inverse temperature @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a subset of the local minima of the hamiltonian @xmath63 and let @xmath69 , @xmath70 . under some assumptions on the hamiltonian , they computed the expectation of the hitting time of @xmath71 starting from @xmath70 and they proved that this hitting time properly renormalized converges to an exponential random variable .",
    "they also provided a formula for the probability that starting from @xmath70 the process returns to the set @xmath68 at a local minima @xmath72 in terms of the right eigenvectors of the jump matrix of the chain .",
    "this latter formula , although interesting from the theoretical point of view , since it establishes a link between the spectral properties of the generator and the metastable behavior of the process , is of little pratical use because one is usually unable to compute the eigenvectors of the generator .    in our approach ,",
    "we replace the formula of the jump probabilities written through eigenvectors of the generator by one , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.9 and lemma 6.8 ) , expressed only in terms of the capacities , capacities which can be estimated using the dirichlet and the thomson variational principles .",
    "this latter formula allows us to prove the convergence of the process ( in fact , of the trace process in the usual skorohod topology or of the original process in a weaker topology introduced in @xcite ) by solving a martingale problem .",
    "metastability of locally conserved dynamics or of conservative dynamics superposed with non - conservative ones have been considered before .",
