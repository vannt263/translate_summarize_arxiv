    "the average s abundance determined from the three lines corresponds to [ s / fe ] = 0.27 ( nissen et al .",
    "2007 ) . ]    instead of using equivalent widths , abundances can be determined by fitting a synthetic spectral line profile , calculated for a model atmosphere , to the observed line profile using the abundance of the element as a free parameter of the fit ( see fig . [",
    "fig : syn1046.g29 - 23 ] ) . for a line significantly blended by other spectral lines , this is the only way to derive a reliable abundance .",
    "other lines have to be used to determine element abundances for the blending lines and to estimate line broadening parameters associated with stellar rotation and macroturbulence .",
    "hence , the fitting is an iterative process that involves several line regions . it can be done automatically and may include a determination of the basic atmospheric parameters , effective temperature @xmath23 , and surface gravity @xmath24 , from ratios between selected lines .",
    "a good example of an automatic method is presented by barklem et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who determine abundances of 22 elements from eso vlt / uves spectra by fitting hundreds of spectral windows containing suitable lines . the procedure includes the identification of continuum points in the windows , adjustments of line centers , rejection of lines disturbed by cosmic - ray hits and @xmath25-square minimization of the difference between the synthetic and the observed spectrum . for low- and medium - resolution spectra , for which individual lines are not resolved and the continuum is not reached , abundances can be determined by similar methods ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "2011 ; kirby et al .",
    "2009 ) , or may be based on line - indices that can be calibrated via high - resolution data or by model - atmosphere calculations .",
    "stellar abundances are normally based on a model - atmosphere analysis of the available spectra . in most cases ,",
    "a plane - parallel , homogeneous ( 1d ) model is adopted , and it is assumed that the distributions of atoms over the possible excitation and ionization states are given by boltzmann s and saha s equations . this condition is called ` local thermodynamic equilibrium ' ( lte ) .",
    "the temperature structure of the model is derived from the requirement that the total flux of energy as transported by radiation and convection should be constant throughout the atmosphere and given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath23 is the effective temperature of the star .",
    "furthermore , the atmosphere is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and the pressure @xmath28 as a function of optical depth @xmath29 is determined from the equation @xmath30 where @xmath24 is the gravity in the stellar atmosphere and @xmath31 the continuous absorption coefficient as determined primarily by h@xmath32 absorption in optical and infrared spectra of f , g , and k stars . for these cool stars ,",
    "electrons in the stellar atmosphere mainly come from the ionization of elements like mg , si , and fe and the relation between total pressure and electron pressure @xmath33 therefore depends on both metallicity and the @xmath1/fe ratio .",
    "details of the construction of 1d stellar models may be found in textbooks on stellar atmospheres .",
    "the most used grid of models are the atlas9 models of kurucz ( 1993 ) and the uppsala marcs models ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2008 ) . in both sets of models ,",
    "convection is treated in the classical mixing - length approximation .    as reviewed by asplund ( 2005 ) ,",
    "1d models give only a first approximation to the temperature structures of stellar atmospheres .",
    "the convection creates an inhomogeneous structure with hot rising granules and cool downflows .",
    "inhomogeneous ( 3d ) models can be constructed by solving the standard equations for conservation of mass , momentum and energy in connection with the radiative transfer equation for a representative volume of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the mean temperature structure of such 3d models may differ significantly from that of 1d models especially in the case of metal - poor stars .",
    "due to the expansion of rising granulation elements and the lack of radiative heating when the line absorption coefficient is small , the 3d models have much lower temperature and electron pressure in the upper layers than classical 1d models in radiative equilibrium .      for a given model atmosphere , the flux @xmath34 in an absorption line can be calculated by solving the transfer equation .",
    "integration over the line profile relative to the continuum flux @xmath35 then gives the equivalent width @xmath36    it is the ratio between the line and continuous absorption coefficients , @xmath37 , that determines the line depth and hence the equivalent width .",
    "for a weak ( un - saturated ) line , the equivalent width is approximately proportional to the abundance ratio @xmath38 , where x is the element corresponding to the line .",
    "for saturated lines , the equivalent width also depends on line broadening due to small scale turbulent gas motions . in 1d modelling",
    "this introduces an additional atmospheric parameter , the microturbulence , that can be determined from the requirement that the same fe abundance should be derived from weak and medium - strong fei lines .",
    "strong lines with damping wings are sensitive to the the value of the collisional damping constant .",
    "clearly , the most accurate abundances are derived from weak lines if observed with high resolution and @xmath39 .",
    "the equivalent width of a line also depends on the oscillator strength and the populations of the energy levels corresponding to the line . in lte ,",
    "boltzmann s and saha s equations are used to determine the population numbers .",
    "this may , however , be a poor approximation as reviewed by asplund ( 2005 ) .",
    "instead , one can use that a stellar atmosphere is in a steady state , i.e that the population @xmath40 of a level @xmath41 does not vary in time .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the transition rates for radiative and collisional processes , respectively .",
    "the summation is extended over all @xmath45 levels with @xmath46 . in such , so - called non - lte calculations ,",
    "the population numbers are found by solving @xmath45 equations of the same type as eq .",
    "in addition , the transfer equation must be solved , because the radiative transition rates depend on the mean intensity of the radiation .",
    "departures from lte can be large and affect derived stellar abundances very significantly ( asplund 2005 ) .",
    "however , in some cases collisional transition rates are not well known , and the calculated non - lte populations become rather uncertain . in particular , this is the case for inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "often , the recipes of drawin ( 1969 ) are adopted , but since these estimates are based on classical physics , they only provide an order - of - magnitude estimate of the collisional rates . hence , a scaling factor @xmath47 to the drawin formula has to be introduced . it may be calibrated on the basis of solar spectra by requesting that lines with different excitation potential and from different ionization stages should provide the same abundance or one may vary @xmath47 to investigate how the uncertainty of collisional rates affects the derived abundances .    given that non - lte calculations are sometimes uncertain and that a grid of 3d models is not yet available , a _",
    "1d lte analysis is often applied to determine abundance ratios . for narrow ranges in the basic atmospheric parameters ,",
    "say @xmath48k in @xmath23 , @xmath49dex in log@xmath24 , and @xmath50dex in [ fe / h ] , one may assume that non - lte and 3d effects on the abundances are about the same for all stars .",
    "hence , precise differential abundances with respect to a standard star can be derived in lte .    for f and g stars with metallicities around [ fe / h ]",
    "= 0 , the sun is an obvious choice as a standard , and logarithmic abundance ratios with respect to the sun , like [ mg / fe ] , can be derived from the same lines in the spectra of the stars and the sun . at lower metallicities ,",
    "bright stars with well known atmospheric parameters can be chosen as standards .",
    "this method has the additional advantage that the oscillator strength of a line cancels out so that its error plays no role .",
    "such differential abundance ratios can be determined to a precision of about @xmath51dex ( e.g. neves et al .",
    "2009 ; nissen & schuster 2010 ) .",
    "when using chemical abundances to trace stellar population , it is just these very precise differential abundance ratios at a given metallicity that are needed .",
    "trends of abundance ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] derived under the lte assumption are , on the other hand , less accurate , because non - lte and 3d effects change with metallicity .      in order to determine precise abundance ratios , reliable values of the stellar atmospheric parameters , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and [ fe / h ] ,",
    "must be determined . some abundance ratios like",
    "[ mg / fe ] determined from neutral atomic lines are fairly insensitive to errors in the atmospheric parameters , but other ratios like [ o / fe ] with the oxygen abundance determined from the high excitation oi triplet or from oh lines depend critically on the adopted values for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the effective temperature of a late - type star can be determined from a colour index , e.g. @xmath52 , calibrated in terms of @xmath23 by the infrared flux method .",

    "the reddening is , however , a problem and @xmath23 is better determined spectroscopically , e.g. from the wings of balmer lines or from the requirement that [ fe / h ] derived from fei lines should be independent of the excitation potential of the lines . in this way",
    ", differential values of @xmath23 can be determined to a precision of @xmath55k ( nissen 2008 ) .    the best way to determine",

    "this leads to the following expression for the gravity of a star relative to that of the sun ( log@xmath60 in the cgs system )    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the absolute bolometric magnitude , which can be determined from the apparent magnitude if the distance to the star is known .",

    ", the gravity can be determined spectroscopically from the difference in [ fe / h ] derived from neutral and ionized iron lines .",
    "fei lines change very little with @xmath24 , whereas feii lines change significantly .",
    "departures from lte in the ionization equilibrium of fe should , however , be taken into account .",
    "this may be done by requiring that the difference [ fe / h](feii)@xmath63[fe / h](fei ) has the same value as in the case of a standard star with a surface gravity that is accurately determined from eq .",
    "( 6 ) . in this way",
    "differential values of log@xmath24 can be determined to a precision of about @xmath64dex ( nissen 2008 ) .    due to the non - lte effects on the ionization balance of fe , [ fe / h ]",
    "should be determined from feii lines , because they represent the dominating ionization stage of iron .",
    "if lte is assumed , [ fe / h ] derived from fei lines turns out to be 0.1 to 0.2 dex lower than [ fe / h ] derived from feii lines in the case of metal - poor f , g , and k stars .",
    "it is likely that this problem is due to a higher degree of fei ionization than predicted by the saha equation ( mashonkina et al .",
    "2011 ) .      as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sect : intro ] , it is generally assumed that the atmosphere of a late - type star with an upper convection zone has retained a ` fossil ' record of the composition of the galaxy at the time and the place for the formation of the star .",
    "a high - resolution study of the metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath65 ) globular cluster ngc6397 by korn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) indicates , however , that the abundances of mg , ca , ti , and fe in main - sequence turnoff stars are about 0.12dex ( 30% ) lower than the abundances of these elements in k giants .",
    "this may be explained by downward diffusion of the elements at the bottom of the convection zone for turnoff stars .",
    "the elements are depleted by about the same factor , so the effect of diffusion on abundance ratios is less than 0.05dex .    for the solar atmosphere ,",
    "the depletion by diffusion of elements heavier than boron is predicted to have been about 0.04dex ( turcotte & wimmer - schweingruber 2002 ) and the effect of diffusion on abundance ratios is negligible .",
    "this is confirmed by the good agreement of abundance ratios for non - volatile elements in the solar atmosphere and in the most primitive meteorites , the carbonaceous chondrites ( asplund et al .",
    "a very precise study of solar ` twin ' stars ( i.e. stars having nearly the same @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and [ fe / h ] as the sun ) by melndez et al . ( 2009 ) shows , on the other hand , that the sun has a higher abundance ratio of volatile elements ( c , n , o , s , and zn ) with respect to fe than the large majority of twin stars .",
    "the deviation is about 0.05dex . as suggested by the authors ,",
    "this may be explained by selective accretion of refractory elements , including iron , on dust particles in the proto - solar disk .",
    "thus , some fraction of the refractory elements may end up in terrestrial planets . if true , abundance ratios like [ o / fe ] and [ s / fe ] can deviate by @xmath66dex from the original ratio in the interstellar cloud that formed the star depending on whether the star is with or without terrestrial planets .",
    "it is concluded that the effects of diffusion may change some abundance ratios by up to 0.05dex for metal - poor stars with relatively thin convection zones . in the case of disk stars , the abundances of volatile elements relative to iron",
    "could be affected by dust - gas separation in connection with star and planet formation by @xmath67dex . for refractory elements",
    "there are no indications of differences in abundance rations between stars with and without detected planets ( neves et al .",
    "this section presents a discussion of some abundance ratios that have been used as tracers of stellar populations . in several cases , the nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the corresponding elements",
    "are not well understood ; nevertheless , the abundance ratios have proven to be very useful in disentangling stellar populations .",
    "in addition , the observed differences and trends provide important constraints on sne modeling and theories of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "abundances of c and o can be determined from spectral lines corresponding to forbidden transitions between low excitation states and allowed transitions between high - excitation states for neutral atoms .",
    "in addition , molecular ch and oh lines in the blue - uv and infrared spectral regions can be applied .",
    "the most reliable c and o abundances are derived from the forbidden [ ci ] @xmath68 and [ oi ] @xmath69 lines , provided that these rather weak lines are measured with sufficient spectral resolution and @xmath39 .",
    "both lines are blended ; [ oi ] by a nii line and [ ci ] by a weak fei line .",
    "these blends must be taken into account when deriving abundances .",
    "a strong collisional coupling with the ground states ensures that the [ ci ] and [ oi ] lines are formed in lte .",
    "the correction for 3d effects is small for the sun ( asplund 2005 ) but increases with decreasing metallicity and may reach as much as @xmath70dex in turnoff stars with [ fe / h ] = @xmath71 ( nissen et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the [ ci ] line is too weak to be a useful abundance indicator for metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath72 ) dwarf and subgiant stars . in giants , carbon abundances",
    "are changed by dredge - up of gas affected by cn - cycle hydrogen burning .",
    "the [ oi ] line , on the other hand , can be used to derive oxygen abundances in dwarfs and subgiants down to [ fe / h]@xmath65 and in giants down to metallicities around @xmath73 .",
    "alternatively , carbon and oxygen abundances in halo stars can be derived from high - excitation atomic lines ( the ci lines around 9100  and the oi triplet at 7774 ) but in both cases the non - lte effects are uncertain ( fabbian et al .",
    "ch and oh lines can be used to derive carbon and oxygen abundances even at extremely low metallicities , but they are very sensitive to @xmath23 and large 3d corrections should be applied ( asplund 2005 ) . due to these problems ,",
    "c and o abundances in halo stars are quite uncertain .",
    "carbon seems to follow iron , i.e. [ c / fe ] @xmath74 from [ fe / h ] = 0 to @xmath73 ( bensby & feltzing 2006 ; fabbian et al .",
    ". [ o / fe ] raises from zero to about + 0.5dex , when the metallicity of disk stars decreases from [ fe / h]=0 to @xmath75 and then stays approximately constant at [ o / fe ] @xmath76 down to [ fe / h ] @xmath77 ( nissen et al .",
    "according to cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who derived oxygen abundances in giants from the [ oi ] line , the constant level of [ o / fe ] continues all the way down to [ fe / h ] @xmath78 , if one assumes that 3d corrections are the same as in metal - poor dwarf stars .",
    "although the trends of [ c / fe ] and [ o / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] are somewhat uncertain due to non - lte and 3d effects , the ratio between the abundances of c and o is more immune to these problems .",
    "this stems from the fact that the forbidden [ ci ] and [ oi ] lines have about the same dependence of temperature and pressure .",
    "hence , the derived [ c / o ] is insensitive to 3d effects .",
    "the same is the case for [ c / o ] derived from high - excitation atomic lines .",
    "furthermore , as shown by fabbian et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the non - lte corrections of c and o abundances derived from ci and oi lines tend to cancel , so that the trend of [ c / o ] vs. [ o / h ] is fairly independent of the choice of the hydrogen collision parameter , @xmath47 ( see sect .",
    "[ fig : co - o.all ] shows this trend for @xmath79 , with the abundances determined from forbidden lines for disk stars and from high - excitation atomic lines for the halo stars .",
    "carbon is synthesized in stellar interiors by the triple-@xmath1 process , but it is unclear which objects are the main contributors to the chemical evolution of carbon in the galaxy .",
    "type ii sne , wolf - rayet stars , intermediate- and low - mass stars in the planetary nebula phase , and stars at the end of the giant phase have been suggested .",
    "oxygen , on the other hand , seem to be produced exclusively by @xmath1-capture on c in short - lived massive stars and is dispersed to the interstellar medium by type ii sne .",
    "hence , the c / o ratio has the potential of being a good tracer of stellar populations .",
    "the separation between thin- and thick - disk stars in fig .",
    "[ fig : co - o.all ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "the approximately constant [ c / o]@xmath80 for halo stars with [ o / h ] between @xmath81 and @xmath82 probably corresponds to the c / o yield ratio for massive stars .",
    "the increase in [ c / o ] for the thick - disk stars may be due to metallicity dependent winds from wolf - rayet stars , whereas the delayed production of carbon by low- and intermediate - mass stars can explain the higher [ c / o ] in thin - disk stars .",
    "the upturn of [ c / o ] at the lowest values of [ o / h ] , which is also found for distant damped lyman-@xmath1 ( dla ) galaxies ( cooke et al .",
    "2011 ) , could be due to enhanced carbon production by massive first generation stars with extremely high rotation velocities ( chiappini et al .",
    "2006 ) .      the even-@xmath83 elements , mg , si , s , ca , and ti are mainly produced by successive capture of @xmath1-particles in connection with carbon , oxygen and neon burning in massive stars and dispersed into the interstellar medium by type ii supernovae explosions on a time - scale of @xmath84 years .",
    "iron is also produced by sne ii , but the bulk of fe comes from type ia sne on a much longer time - scale ( @xmath85 years ) .",
    "hence , the ratio between the abundance of an @xmath1-capture element and iron in a star depends on how long the star - formation process had proceeded before the star was formed . in this way",
    ", [ @xmath1/fe ] becomes an important tracer of populations .",
    "mg , si , ca , and ti abundances can be determined from several weak atomic lines in the optical spectra of late - type stars , whereas sulphur is more difficult as discussed below .",
    "traditionally , [ @xmath1/fe ] is therefore defined as the average value of [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , and [ ti / fe ] ( see sect .",
    "2.1 ) . as discussed by asplund ( 2005 )",
    ", departures from lte have some effects on the metallicity trends of [ @xmath1/fe ] but probably not more than 0.1dex , when weak lines are used .",
    "if the abundances are based on neutral lines , [ @xmath1/fe ] is quite insensitive to @xmath23 and 3d effects , although high excitation lines are to be preferred ( asplund 2005 , fig .",
    "8)    the trend of [ @xmath1/fe ] with metallicity is characterized by an increase of about 0.3dex when [ fe / h ] decreases from 0 to @xmath75 .",

    "in addition to the underabundance of [ @xmath1/fe ] , the more metal - rich stars in dsph galaxies stand out by having low [ na / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] abundances ( fig .",
    "11 ) as well as high [ ba / y ] ratios ( venn et al . 2004 ) . at the lowest metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath231 , the abundance ratios are , however , similar to those in galactic halo stars , which suggests that the abundance deviations of dsph stars should not be explained in terms of an anomalous imf .",
    "the most obvious reason for the underabundances of [ @xmath1/fe ] is that the star formation rate in surviving dsph galaxies has been so slow that type ia sne started to contribute fe at a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath65 .",
    "dwarf galaxies are , however , not ruled out as ` building blocks ' of the galactic halo , because early accreted dsph galaxies probably have had a somewhat faster chemical evolution than the less masive present - day dsph galaxies in the outer halo ( font et al .",
    "the last decade has seen great progress in determinations of abundance ratios that can be used as tracers of stellar populations .",

    "furthermore , abundances of galactic bulge stars are now been obtained from high - resolution infrared spectra , but the spectral coverage is small and there is no multiplex advantages .",
    "hence , the number of bulge stars studied with infrared spectra is still limited .",
    "more efficient infrared echelle spectrographs with multiplex capabilities are needed to take advantage of the lower reddening in the infrared spectral region , when dealing with the bulge and the inner part of the disk .",

    "[ sect : abundet ] .",
    "most studies are still based on homogeneous model atmospheres and the assumption of lte , but several works show that inhomogeneous models and deviations from lte can change the derived abundances significantly .",
    "such 3d and non - lte modelling is difficult to carry out and in some cases the derived abundances are sensitive to uncertain hydrogen collision cross sections .",
    "hence , the derived trends of abundance ratios as a function of metallicity can be quite uncertain .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible to determine precise differences of abundance ratios by a 1d lte analysis of a sample of stars confined to small ranges in effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity . in this way",
    ", abundance ratios can be used to disentangle stellar populations .",
    "care should , however , be taken when comparing different spectral types and luminosity classes , such as f and g dwarfs with k giants , because systematic errors may be important .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : tracers ] , the abundance ratios [ @xmath1/fe ] , [ c / o ] , [ na / fe ] , [ ni / fe ] , [ cu / fe ] , [ eu / ba ] , and [ ba / y ] are of high interest as tracers of stellar populations .",
    "the usefulness of these ratios is related to the fact that the elements involved are produced in different types of stars .",
    "the nucleosynthesis is not well understood for all elements , but it seems that variations of the ratios from one population to the next can be explained in terms of different rates of star formation and chemical evolution . in general , one does not need to invoke variations in the initial mass function to explain the abundance ratios .",
    "a better understanding of the nucleosynthesis of the elements is , however , important in order to learn more about the formation and evolution of the various populations .",
    "the power of abundance ratios as population tracers is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : all.alpha - fe ] , where [ @xmath1/fe ] is plotted as a function of [ fe / h ] for seven different populations .",
    "[ @xmath1/fe ] is defined as the average value of [ mg / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] , and may be used to estimate the time - scale for the chemical enrichment of the population , as explained in sect .",
    "[ sect : intermediate ] . on the basis of this figure and the more detailed discussion in the previous sections ,",
    "the following conclusions about stellar populations in the galactic disk , the bulge and the halo can be made .",
    "the disk consists of two main populations , the thin and the thick disk , which differ in [ @xmath1/fe ] as well as [ c / o ] and [ eu / ba ] .",
    "the thick disk is formed on a relatively short time - scale with enrichment from type ii sne only up to [ fe / h]@xmath232 .",
    "thin - disk stars have lower values of [ @xmath1/fe ] due to type ia sne contributions to the chemical enrichment ; hence the time - scale of evolution is longer than in the case of the thick disk . in the metallicity range @xmath169 [ fe / h ] @xmath129 ,",
    "a gap in [ @xmath1/fe ] is present between the two disks .",
    "altogether , the [ @xmath1/fe ] distribution of disk stars is well explained by a scenario , for which a period of rapid star formation in the early galactic disk was interrupted by a merging satellite galaxy that ` heated ' the already formed stars to thick - disk kinematics .",
    "this was followed by a hiatus in star formation , in which metal - poor gas was accreted and type ia sne caused [ @xmath1/fe ] to decrease .",
    "when star formation resumed , the first thin disk stars formed with low metallicity and low [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "however , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : alphadistr ] , an alternative model with a monotonically decreasing star formation rate and radial migration of stars and gas ( schnrich & binney 2009a , 2009b ) also predicts a bimodal distribution of [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "very precise measurements of the distributions of [ @xmath1/fe ] as well as [ c / o ] and [ eu / ba ] for a large volume - limited sample of f and g main - sequence stars would be important to distinguish between the two competing models for disk formation .    for the bulge ,",
    "there has been great progress in studies of abundance ratios in recent years . in some works ,",
    "enhanced values of [ @xmath1/fe]@xmath133 are found for stars as metal - rich as the sun , but in the most precise differential studies ( alves - brito et al .",

    "the abundances derived by bensby et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for microlensed main - sequence stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all.alpha - fe ] ) suggest that the bulge may consist of two distinct populations : i.e. old metal - poor stars with enhanced [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios related to the thick disk , and younger very metal - rich stars with disk - like @xmath1/fe ratios .",
    "still , one would like to see many more bulge stars observed before drawing conclusions concerning models for bulge formation from the abundance ratios .    for halo stars in the solar neighbourhood",
    ", there is evidence for the existence of two distinct populations clearly separated in [ @xmath1/fe ] , [ na / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : twohalopop ] .",
    "the high-@xmath1 stars have abundance ratios very similar to thick - disk stars .",
    "they may be ancient stars formed in the galactic disk or bulge and ejected to the halo by merging satellite galaxies ( purcell et al . 2010 ; zolotov et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) , or they may simply belong to the high - velocity tail of a thick disk with a non - gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "the low-@xmath1 stars tend to have retrograde motions and many of them move on elongated radial orbits close to the galactic plane as predicted for the stellar debris of the captured @xmath105cen progenitor galaxy .",
    "it is likely that the low - alpha stars have been accreted from dsph galaxies with a relatively slow chemical evolution , for which type ia sne started to contribute iron at [ fe / h]@xmath233 .",

    "this may be due to chemical enrichment from intermediate - mass agb stars undergoing hot - bottom hydrogen burning .",
