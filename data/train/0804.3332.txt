    "we conclude that the @xmath52 have a non - analytic behavior and that similar cusps in @xmath19 are expected , due to the @xmath79 dependence of ( [ epaps : f12_lll_epaps]-[epaps : f2_epaps ] ) .",
    "while the energy cusps are downward , the same does not hold in general for @xmath19 . nevertheless , for the particular case @xmath0 we can infer the qualitative form from our previous results .",
    "if at @xmath0 a noninteracting cf sea were realized , the @xmath31 , @xmath78 curves would go smoothly through the cfs values shown in fig .",
    "[ epaps : gc_vs_nu_epaps ] . as discussed in the main text ,",
    "this condition might be observed when the temperature exceeds the pairing energy @xcite , while at lower temperature an incompressible state is formed .",
    "therefore , also the smooth cfs curves would evolve with temperature to form cusps at @xmath0 .",
    "since the pfaffian values of @xmath31 , @xmath78 are lower than the cf sea ones , this suggests the presence of two _ downward _ cusps in @xmath31 and @xmath78 of which the former is more pronounced ."
