    "the large systematic error is dominated by uncertainties in fitting and are estimated by considering alternate backgrounds .",
    "the mass and the width of @xmath2 were taken as _ a priori _ in the extraction , which may no longer be appropriate when the data has improved by more than three orders of magnitude by the b factories . to reduce the effect caused by uncertain properties such as the width and sub - decay modes of @xmath2 , an amplitude that takes into account as complete substructures of @xmath2 as possible is needed .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen from the fit to the @xmath60 data , a non - resonant part that respects pqcd at higher @xmath112 may contribute significantly to the results , which must also be taken into account to complete the construction of the amplitude .",
    "of course , the cost would be to boost the number of fit parameters , but fortunately one now has enormous amount of data .    as noted in the end of the previous section ,",
    "the @xmath2 contribution depends on @xmath123 and @xmath130 roughly through the ratio @xmath199 .",
    "thus , @xmath205 mode is not so powerful for determining the resonance parameters .",
    "one needs independent determination of these parameters , especially @xmath130 from other sources .",
    "therefore , it appears that , to extract the axial @xmath202-@xmath203 form factor @xmath83 and understand properly the @xmath2 component , one needs to perform a combined analysis of @xmath205 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath210 .    in conclusion ,",
    "based on what is revealed by 29.4 fb@xmath8 data from belle , we have illustrated how to extract the timelike @xmath45-@xmath46 axial form factor @xmath268 from @xmath269 data .",
    "the method can be easily generalized to other form factors by angular analysis when more data becomes available . with @xmath270",
    "300 fb@xmath8 data already accumulated by kekb and pep - ii , if the case for factorization in such three - body @xmath39 decays is further strengthened , the b factories may be promising for the study of hadronic form factors that may be otherwise inaccessible .",
    "hadronic form factors have played an instrumental role in the formulation of nuclear and particle physics , and further insight may perhaps be gained from quantities such as the @xmath202-@xmath203 axial form factor .",
    "our study already indicates that the ron - resonant contribution , needed to account for large @xmath112 behavior , is rather significant .",
    "the current discussion also illustrates how nucleon axial form factors can be extracted from @xmath271 decay once the spectrum becomes available .",
