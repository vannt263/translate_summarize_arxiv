    "the source 1e 1024.05732 was discovered serendipitously with the _ einstein observatory _ by goldwurm , caraveo & bignami ( 1987 ) when they were searching for soft x - ray counterparts of the cos b galactic gamma - ray source 2cg 284 - 00 .",
    "caraveo , bignami & goldwurm ( 1989 ) excluded the possibility that the x - ray emission had a coronal origin on the basis of the ratio between the x - ray and optical flux @xmath1 @xmath2 , which would imply an l@xmath3/l@xmath4 much larger than the average value of 10@xmath5 observed in the first x - ray studies of o - type stars ( cassinelli et al .",
    "the source was visible only in seven einstein ipc energy channels ( 0.5 - 3.5 kev ) , making any spectral fitting procedure very uncertain .",
    "the data fitted equally well to a power - law , bremsstrahlung and blackbody models and therefore the x - ray spectral parameters were affected by large uncertainties .",
    "caraveo , bignami & goldwurm ( 1989 ) also reported a periodicity of 60.69272@xmath60.00006 seconds , which they attributed to the rapid spin of a compact companion . from their optical observations they concluded that wackerling 2134 , a highly reddened o5 star at an estimated maximum distance of 3 kpc was the most likely optical counterpart .",
    "therefore the scenario proposed by these authors to explain the nature of 1e 1024.05732 was that of a massive x - ray binary in which a hot o5 type star loses mass to a spinning neutron star .",
    "the x - ray emission would be due to the accretion mechanism via the strong stellar wind of the optical primary .",
    "mereghetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) confirmed the association of the x - ray source 1e 1024.0 - 5732 with wack  2134 .",
    "however , using data from a rosat pspc observation they failed to detect any periodic modulation . the lack of pulsations and the dependence of l@xmath3/l@xmath4 on the poorly constrained interstellar absorption led these authors to prefer the interpretation of this source as a binary system consisting of a wolf - rayet primary and an o - type star secondary . in this case",
    ", the x - ray emission would be produced as a consequence of the collision of their very strong stellar winds .",
    "we obtained three optical spectra of wack  2134 on june 20 , 21 and 23 , 1997 using the 1.9 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "all three spectra were taken with the its spectrograph and the site ccd detector .",
    "the 1200 l mm@xmath7 grating no 5 , blazed at 6800  , was used in first order on the night june 20 , 1997 , whereas the 1200 l mm@xmath7 grating no 4 , blazed at 4600  , also in first order , was used on the other two nights .",
    "the slit width was set to 250 @xmath8 m . with this set - up",
    "the dispersion was @xmath9  / pixel .",
    "table [ sp ] gives the journal of the optical spectroscopic observations .",
    "the data were reduced using the _ starlink _ supported figaro package ( shortridge et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in table  [ int ] a long - term increase in the x - ray flux of 1e   1024.05732 is apparent .",
    "if the system is a long period colliding wind binary , then colliding wind theory ( stevens , blondin & pollock 1992 ) would suggest that the x - ray luminosity is related to the separation @xmath10 between the two components , reaching a maximum at periastron , that is , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , a long - term increase of the x - ray flux may indicate that the system is moving towards periastron .",
    "such behaviour has been observed in hd193793 , a p@xmath12=7.94 yr colliding wind system ( williams et al .",
    "in support of this idea there is the fact that the flux in 1e  1024.0 - 5732 peaks at @xmath0 4 kev ( fig [ specx ] ) .",
    "the theory predicts a hardening of the x - ray emission at periastron due to the greater absorption , with the flux maximum moving from 1.52 kev at apastron to around 5 kev at periastron ( stevens , blondin & pollock 1992 ) .",
    "x - rays from colliding winds are expected to show up at energies @xmath13 34 kev , since at lower energies the soft emission from the intrinsic wind shocks of the individual components may dominate the spectrum .",
    "the absence of x - ray emission above @xmath0 5 kev was considered by skinner , itoth & nagase ( 1998 ) as a proof to disregard the presence of a compact companion in the wolf - rayet system hd  50896 ( ez cma ) . however , the opposite statement , i.e. , the presence of significant x - ray emission above 5 kev , does not exclude the cwb model since theoretical models and hydrodynamic simulations of colliding wind systems predict certain level of hard ( 210 kev ) x - ray emission .",
    "the hardest x - rays are expected to come from the line of centres of the system , where the highest temperature gas lies ( stevens , blondin & pollock 1992 ; willis , schild & stevens 1995 ) . the x - ray emission of 1e 1024.05732 appears to be too soft for a hmxb .",
    "the x - ray flux decreases considerably above 15 kev , unlike other accreting pulsars also observed with rxte which shows significant emission up to 30 kev .",
    "likewise , the x - ray luminosity in the energy range 315 kev is also lower , by about one order of magnitude , than the typical luminosity of the faintest hmxb .",
    "table  [ comp ] shows a comparison of some observational characteristics of 1e  1024.05732/wack  2134 to other cwb and hmxb with supergiant primaries .",
    "the luminosity derived from our rxte data , @xmath0 1.6 @xmath14 10@xmath15 erg s@xmath7 , at 3 kpc , would make 1e  1024.05732 one of the more luminous colliding wind systems , only comparable to hd  193793 ( see table  [ comp ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the distance is poorly constraint and the value of 3 kpc may be considered as an upper limit ( caraveo , bignami & goldwurm 1989 ) .",
    "thus , a lower x - ray luminosity is possible , which would agree with the x - ray luminosity normally seen in cwb ( about one order of magnitude lower ) .",
    "note also that the x - ray luminosity reported in this work corresponds to a broader energy range ( 315 kev ) than normally quoted for colliding wind systems .",
    "single and multi - componets models were used to fit the x - ray spectrum of 1e 1024.0 - 5732 in the energy range 3 - 15 kev .",
    "the results of the spectral fitting are summarised in table  [ models ] . in the case of the optical thin plasma emission model ( vmekal )",
    "no good fit was achieved by fixing all the element abundances to solar values , possibly indicating that the system does not consist of only an ob massive star . by letting the fe abundace be a free parameter the reduced @xmath16 decreased to acceptable levels ( @xmath17 2 ) ,",
    "although it is still higher ( @xmath181.7 ) than the other models considered . in wr stars the outer hydrogen envelope has been stripped away due to the large mass - loss rates . therefore , wr stars are expected to be nonsolar in their chemical composition .",
    "the fit to the overall spectrum of cwb is generally improved by using two temperature components .",
    "a cooler ( @xmath17 0.7 kev ) and a hotter ( @xmath19 2 kev ) components were proven to give good fits ( skinner et al .",
    "1998 ; corcoran et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we tried the same approach here but the vmekal+vmekal model did not turn out to be statistically significant when compared to the nonsolar single temperature model .",
    "it is likely that this lack of significance is due to the conditions of our observation rather than to the model itself .",
    "the impossibility of rxte to detect photons below 2.5 kev makes it difficult to constrain the temperature of a possible cooler component and the photoelectric absorbing columns .",
    "likewise the low s / n and low energy resolution prevent us from extracting element abundances .",
    "nevertheless , the best - fit temperatures of the bremsstrahlung and vmekal models , @xmath20 5 kev , lie in between the temperature of the hotter components in other cwb  1.4 kev for @xmath21 velorum ( stevens et al .",
    "1996 ) , 3.1 kev for hd  50896 ( skinner et al .",
    "1998 ) and 5.9 kev for @xmath22 carinae",
    "( corcoran et al . 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the good fit found with the power - law plus fixed solar abundances mekal model would , in principle , favour the hmxb model since , on physical grounds , we would expect thermal emission ( mekal ) from the o - type star and non - thermal emission ( power - law ) from accelerated electron in the accretion flow .",
    "however , one can argue that the best - fit temperature @xmath23 kev is too high to be originated in the wind of a single o star , for which much softer spectra ( @xmath24 kev ) have been observed ( berghfer , schmitt & cassinelli 1996 ) .    in hmxb the presence of the iron k@xmath25 emission line",
    "is commonly seen , with a variety of strenghts .",
    "it is abscribed to fluorescent reprocessing by less ionized iron in relatively cold circumstellar material .",
    "however , such a line is not exclusive of x - ray binaries but was reported to be present in , at least , two cwb : hd  193793 at 6.66 kev ( koyama et al . 1994 ) and in @xmath21 velorum at 6.9 kev ( stevens et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the case of 1e  1024.05732",
    "the feature at 6.6 kev can be identified as k@xmath25 emission from fe xx  xxiii . from table  [ comp ]",
    "we see that iron lines in cwb seem to be centred at slighter higher energies than in hmxb , which implies that the ionisation degree of iron in the wind surrounding the neutron star in supergiant hmxb is lower ( fe i  fe xii ) than in cwb ( @xmath26 fe xx ) .",
    "the iron line equivalent widths also tend to be larger in cwb .",
    "this difference in the energy of the iron line must also reflect a difference in the location and size of the region responsible for the line emission .",
    "the 6.4 kev line of supergiant hmxb is probably emitted from a region close to the neutron star while the @xmath06.6 kev line of cwb would be produced in the interface where the winds from the primary and secondary collide , that is , a more extended , highly ionised plasma , located farther away from the two binary components . in this respect",
    "the 6.60 kev line observed in 1e  1024.05732 would favour the cwb model for this system but would deny it for @xmath22 carinae ( e(fe)=6.44 kev ) .",
    "however , the true nature of @xmath22 carinae is as yet uncertain ( corcoran et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note the absence of a high energy cut - off in the power - law model fit , so typical of accreting x - ray pulsars . in bright sources",
    "this cut - off energy is seen at about 1520 kev , but tend to decrease to 510 kev as the luminosity decreases ( reynolds , palmar & white 1993 ) .",
    "thus , we would expect to see such a cut - off in the energy spectrum of 1e  1024.0 - 5732 if this source were an x - ray pulsar .",
    "the results from the optical and x - ray analysis presented in this work seem to favour the cwb model for 1e  1024.0 - 5732/wack  2134 .",
    "the presence of o - type and wr features in the optical spectra , the lack of x - ray pulsations , the low x - ray luminosity , the need for non - solar abundances , the relatively soft spectrum and the fact that the iron line is centred at @xmath06.6 kev are difficult to reconcile with the accreting binary model .",
    "further monitoring of the x - ray flux is required to confirm whether the system is approaching periastron .",
    "radio observations are needed to search for non - thermal radiation .",
    "the detection of such type of emission would definitively confirm the nature of the system since cwb are expected to be emitters of such type of radiation , whereas not a single x - ray pulsar has been shown to emit non - thermal radio emission ( fender et al .",
    "1997 ) . following the scheme by conti , massey & vreux ( 1990 ) i- and k - band spectra would help to refine the spectral classification of the system , specially if a wr companion is present .",
    "finally , high resolution x - ray spectra at low energies would allow the detection of different metallic lines ( n , si , fe , mg , s ) expected from an optically thin plasma . in this respect xmm may provide the final key to unmask the true nature of this intringuing system .",

    "coe , i. negueruela and t. belloni for their useful comments and to i. papadakis for his help in the timing analysis of the x - ray data .",
