    "shannon has introduced in @xcite the notions of _ diffusion _ and _ confusion _ which have been mainly accepted and successfully used by cryptologists as guidelines in their work to design secret - key ciphers .",
    "these notions accurately set up a category of `` nice '' cryptographic objects namely the iterative block - ciphers such as the data and advanced encryption standards ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such an algorithm works as an iteration of a certain procedure called the round function .",
    "this functions is made in two pieces , a linear and a nonlinear parts , whose roles are to satisfy shannon s diffusion and confusion .",
    "diffusion refers to a sensitivity to the initial conditions : a small deviation in the input should cause a large change at the output .",
    "the linear part of the round - function is devoted to provide a good level of diffusion .",
    "the goal of confusion is to hide the algebraic relations between the plaintext and the secret - key in order to make harder the statistical attacks .",
    "this is exactly the role assumed by the nonlinear part , also called _ s - boxes_. one of the major attacks for which the s - boxes should be highly resistant is the _ differential cryptanalysis _ @xcite or its `` dual '' counter - part the _ linear attack _ @xcite .",
    "the differential cryptanalysis is intrinsically related to the fashion the plaintexts and the round - keys are combined at each step . as to interlock plaintexts with keys , the xor or component - wise modulo - two sum ( or the addition in characteristic @xmath0 ) is usually chosen because of its implementation efficient nature .",
    "a block - cipher is then vulnerable to the differential attack if there is a nonzero xor difference of two plaintexts such that the difference in output is statistically distinguishable from a random variable that follows a ( discrete ) uniform law .",
    "the s - boxes that offer the best resistance against such an attack are the _ perfect nonlinear functions _ @xcite . as very particular combinatorial objects , perfect nonlinear functions",
    "do not exist in every configurations .",
    "for instance if one works in finite elementary abelian @xmath0-groups , which in practice is usually the case , precisely because of the involutive nature of the addition , perfect nonlinear permutations can not exist .",
    "since , yet in practice the plaintexts and ciphertexts have the same length , we can not use perfect nonlinear permutations as s - boxes .",
    "so in many cases block - ciphers exploit suboptimally differentially resistant functions , such as _ almost perfect nonlinear _ @xcite or even _",
    "differentially @xmath1-uniform _ @xcite functions .",
    "+ we make two simple observations .",
    "we have seen above that by nature , the xor prohibits the existence of perfect nonlinear permutations .",
    "moreover apart from the xor operation , the combination law of plaintexts and keys can take many forms . while really efficient by nature the xor is a very specific case of group action and it could be interesting to use another one . roughly speaking ( more details",
    "are given in subsection  [ grp - action ] ) a group action is nothing but a particular external operation of a group on a set ( as the scalar multiplication of vectors ) .",
    "the set in question is the collection of all the possible plaintexts .",
    "the set of ( round ) keys is endowed with a group structure and operates on the messages .",
    "such a very general block - cipher could be vulnerable to a modified differential attack which should be no more related to the xor differences but to the appropriate group action differences . in @xcite",
    "is presented the algorithm of a such an attack . therefore the determination of the best resistant s - boxes or in other terms the adapted concept of perfect nonlinear functions , is needed .",
    "the theoretic description of such functions covers the following contributions @xcite and the most important definitions and relevant results upon them are recalled in section  [ classic - general ] .",
    "+ we earlier say that altough natural , the xor is not the only way to combine bit - strings . in the finite field setting the multiplication also may be used",
    ". the s - boxes that maximally resist against a differential attack based on the multiplication rather than the addition are called _ multiplicatively perfect nonlinear functions _ and in this paper we prove the existence of permutations with such a cryptographic property in many situations ( and in most cases than classical perfect nonlinear functions ) . in addition , in some very particular cases , the multiplicative group @xmath2 of a finite field @xmath3 in characteristic two can be equipped with another multiplication , which is distributive on the classical one . with this second multiplication ( which is merely an exponentiation ) , @xmath2 turns to be a finite field itself ( but no more of characteristic two ) .",
    "this paper has as its major goal the construction of boolean permutations over @xmath3 which are perfect nonlinear with respect to * both * multiplications of the new field .",
    "they are called _ doubly perfect nonlinear boolean permutations _ and can be seen as relevant alternatives to the use of almost perfect nonlinear permutations .",
    "in this contribution the term _ function _ has the same meaning as the expression _",
    "total function_. if @xmath4 is a finite set then @xmath5 is its cardinality and @xmath6 its identity map . for @xmath7 and @xmath8",
