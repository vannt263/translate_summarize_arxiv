    "in the understanding of cancer development , mathematical modeling and numerical simulations have nowadays complemented experimental and clinical observations .",
    "the field is now mature ; books and surveys are available , as for example @xcite .",
    "a first class of models , initiated in the 70 s by greenspan @xcite , has considered that cancerous cells multiplication is limited by nutrients ( glucosis , oxygen ) brought by blood vessels .",
    "models of this class rely on two kinds of descriptions ; either they describe the dynamics of cell population density @xcite or they consider the geometric motion of the tumor through a free boundary problem ; see and the references therein .",
    "this stage lasts until the tumor reaches the size of @xmath0 mm ; then lack of nutrients leads to cell necrosis which triggers neovasculatures development @xcite that supply the tumor with enough nourishment .",
    "this has motivated a new generation of models where growth is limited by the competition for space @xcite , turning the modeling effort towards mechanical concepts , considering tissues as multiphasic fluids ( the phases could be intersticial water , healthy and tumor cells , extra - cellular matrix  ) @xcite .",
    "this point of view is now sustained by experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "the term homeostatic pressure , coined recently , denotes the lower pressure that prevents cell multiplication by contact inhibition .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain how asymptotic analysis can link the two main approaches , cell density models and free boundary models , in the context of fluid mechanics .",
    "we depart from the simplest cell population density model , proposed in  @xcite , in which the cell population density @xmath1 evolves under pressure forces and cell multiplication according to the equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pressure field .",
    "pressure - limited growth is described by the term @xmath4 , which typically satisfies @xmath5 for some @xmath6 ( the homeostatic pressure ) . the pressure is assumed to be a given increasing function of the density .",
    "a representative example is @xmath7 with parameter @xmath8 . in the free boundary problem to be discussed later , the value @xmath9 represents the maximum packing density of cells , as discussed in @xcite .    nutrients consumed by the tumor cells and brought by the capillary blood network are a usual additional ingredient to the modeling .",
    "the situation is described in that case by the system @xmath10 \\displaystyle \\partial_t c - \\delta c   = - \\varrho \\ ; \\psi(p , c ) , \\\\[2 mm ] c(x , t ) = c_b > 0 \\qquad \\text{as } \\ ; |x| \\to \\infty , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the density of nutrients , and @xmath12 the far field supply of nutrients ( from blood vessels ) . the coupling functions @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 are assumed to be smooth and to satisfy the natural hypotheses @xmath15 \\displaystyle\\partial_p\\psi\\leq 0,\\qquad & \\displaystyle\\partial_c\\psi \\geq 0 , \\qquad&\\displaystyle \\psi(p,0 ) = 0 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    variants are possible ; for instance , we could assume that nutrients are released continuously from a vasculature , then leading to an equation as @xmath16    we will consider below the purely mechanical model under assumptions  , and also the system , where nutrients are taken into account , under assumptions and .",
    "in both cases we will show that the asymptotic limit @xmath17 yields a free boundary model of hele - shaw type , as we were looking for .",
    "let us recall that the mathematical theory of the limit for an equation like in the absence of a growth term is well developed , the asymptotic limit being in this case the standard hele - shaw model for incompressible fluids with free boundaries .",
    "early papers on the subject @xcite consider situations in which mass is conserved and the limit is stationary . in order to have a non - trivial limit evolution one needs some source , either in the equation or at the boundary of the domain . a first example , in which there is an inwards flux at infinity , is given in  @xcite , where the authors study the limit @xmath17 of self - similar focusing ( hole - filling ) solutions to the porous medium equation @xmath18 .",
    "a second example , in which there is a bounded boundary with a nontrivial boundary data , was first considered in  @xcite , and later on in  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the present paper is the first one in which the evolution in the limit is produced by a nonlinear source term in the equation . in order to pass to the limit",
    ", three approaches have been used : weak solutions , variational formulations ( using the so - called baiocchi variable ) , and viscosity solutions ; see @xcite for this last case .",
    "the weak formulation of hele - shaw was first introduced in @xcite , and the variational formulation in  @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that the hele - shaw graph , and hence the hele - shaw equation , can be approximated in other ways , for example by the stefan problem .",
    "this situation has also been considered in the literature , even in situations where there is an evolution in the limit ; see for instance  @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that including the growth term is not a simple change : several powerful but specific tools do not apply any longer .",
    "more deeply , as we explain later , several approaches have no chance to work as they are .",
    "this is the reason why we will work on an equation for the cell density itself rather than the pressure .",
    "we also would like to point out that models of hele - shaw type are still an active field arising in several unexpected applications , see for instance  @xcite , and that surface tension is not covered by the present work ; see @xcite .",

    "is studied in section  [ sec : nutrients ] .",
    "the uniqueness proofs for both cases are highly technical , and are performed separately , in sections  [ sec : uniqueness ] and  [ sec : nutrient_unique ] .",
    "these two sections can safely be skipped by the readers who are mainly interested in the applications .",
    "we finally include an appendix devoted to some interesting examples for the purely mechanical model , that illustrate several phenomena .    _ some notations .",
