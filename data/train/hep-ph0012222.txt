    "the width difference in the @xmath0 system is expected to be the largest rate difference in the b hadron sector @xcite . some experimental bounds on this quantity from lep @xcite and cdf @xcite exist , and",
    "in the near future @xmath2 will be measured quite precisely @xcite .",
    "several factors contribute to the interest in @xmath2 : a large value of the width difference opens up the possibility for novel studies of cp violation without the need for tagging @xcite .",
    "moreover , an experimental value of @xmath2 would give information about the mass difference in the @xmath0 system @xcite ( although at this moment it appears that the mass difference will be measured sooner than the width difference ) .",
    "another interesting point is that new physics can only lead to a decrease of the width difference compared to the standard model value @xcite .",
    "an experimental number which is considerably smaller than the theoretical lower bound , would thus be a hint for new physics that affects @xmath0-@xmath3 mixing . besides the need for a reliable theoretical prediction of @xmath4 in order to fulfill the above physics program it is of conceptual interest to compare experiment and theory in order to test local quark - hadron duality , which is the underlying assumption in calculating heavy quark decay rates .",
    "one can show that duality holds exactly in the limit @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "so far no deviation from duality has been conclusively demonstrated experimentally and theoretical models of duality violation in @xmath7 decays tend to predict rather small effects @xcite .    during the last year",
    "there has been remarkable interest in the lifetime difference of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "besides several experimental studies , many lattice calculations of the relevant nonperturbative constants were done @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this improvement in theory input motivates the present update of the result presented in @xcite .",
    "we also clarify the origin of seemingly disagreeing recent evaluations of @xmath2 .",
    "the theoretical status of the lifetime difference computation is as follows : the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) allows us to expand the decay rate of heavy mesons in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass .",
    "the leading term is described by the decay of a free quark ( the so - called parton model ) and therefore equal for all @xmath7 hadrons .",
    "the next term is suppressed by two powers of the heavy quark mass ; it is related to the kinetic and the chromomagnetic operator .",
    "the so - called weak annihilation and pauli interference diagrams contribute first at third order .",
    "operators involving the spectator quark begin to appear at this order and these are mainly responsible for the lifetime differences of @xmath7 hadrons .",
    "( a smaller contribution comes from the matrix elements of the kinetic and chromomagnetic operator ; for the lifetime difference of @xmath0 mesons these terms vanish identically . )",
    "we can write for the decay rate difference of two mesons @xmath8 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the @xmath9 s are products of perturbatively calculable wilson coefficients and matrix elements , which have to be determined by some non - perturbative methods like lattice - qcd or sum rules . for a comparison of experiment and theory we need besides the experimental value several theoretical ingredients .",
    "first , the perturbative prediction in leading order ( @xmath10 ) , second , corrections due to the strong interaction ( @xmath11 nlo - qcd ) , third , subleading @xmath12-corrections ( @xmath13 ) and last , but not least , the determination of the appearing non - perturbative parameters . for @xmath14",
    "we have all these pieces : the leading term was calculated in @xcite in the factorization approximation ; @xmath12-corrections were determined in @xcite ; the @xmath15-corrections are given in @xcite ; and the lattice values for the decay constant @xmath16 and the bag parameters @xmath7 can be taken from computations directed at the mass difference .",
    "@xmath17 , which is specific to the width difference was calculated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( the matrix elements of the dimension-7-operators , which emerge in @xmath18 , have been estimated up to now only in vacuum insertion approximation @xcite . ) as the calculation of @xmath19 was the first to consider qcd corrections to spectator effects , there is also a conceptual point of interest .",
    "soft gluon emission from the spectator @xmath20 quark leads to power - like infrared divergences , which would spoil the hqe . in @xcite the infrared safety of @xmath4",
    "was explicitly shown , in agreement with the theoretical argument of @xcite .",
    "compared to @xmath4 our knowledge about the lifetimes ratios @xmath21 and @xmath22 is much poorer . here",
    "only @xmath10 is known @xcite , while the calculation of @xmath19 and @xmath13 is still missing .",
    "moreover we only have preliminary lattice studies for the bag parameters in @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "results from sum rules for the bag parameters are discussed in @xcite . for these lifetime ratios",
    "more work needs to be done .",
    "the following update is based on the nlo expressions given in @xcite .",
    "the width difference is normalized to the semi - leptonic @xmath0 branching fraction ; numerically we find @xmath24\\ ] ] we factored out the decay constant and use @xmath7 and @xmath17 to parametrize the matrix elements @xmath25 here @xmath26 denote @xmath27 quark masses at the scale @xmath28gev . the third term in square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ numform ] ) is an estimate of the @xmath12 correction in the factorization approximation @xcite .",
    "( this correction is slightly larger than in @xcite , because we now use @xmath29gev .",
    "we will also use @xmath30gev . )",
    "we note that    * the term involving the parameter @xmath31 , which also appears in the mass difference , is negligible ; * the nlo correction to the coefficient is large and reduces the width difference . in lo",
    "we obtain the coefficients 0.011 and 0.203 instead of 0.007 and 0.132 , respectively ; * the @xmath12 correction is also large and negative , and its importance is amplified by the negative nlo correction .    as a consequence",
    "recent estimates of the width difference tend to be significantly smaller than the leading order estimate of @xcite and those based on the factorization approximation ( @xmath32 )",
    ".    there is another way of representing the result ( [ numform ] ) @xcite based on the observation that @xmath31 appears in the mass difference an the fact the mass difference for @xmath33 mesons is accurately determined experimentally",
    ". then @xmath34\\!.\\ ] ] in this representation the value of the first bracket can be taken from experiments , and @xmath35 is a known factor , if we assume that the ckm matrix is unitary .",
    "the advantage of this representation is that hadronic uncertainties enter only in ratios , i.e.  in @xmath36 and these are believed to be better known than @xmath16 and @xmath37 .",
    "this advantage is more than compensated by the need to know @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ romeform ] ) , which makes the prediction for @xmath39 sensitive to the global fits to the unitarity triangle and the theoretical assumptions that go into it .",
    "in particular , the prediction for @xmath39 now depends on the assumption that the standard model describes flavour mixing correctly , even though the decay of @xmath0 meson is unlikely to be affected by new physics in mixing . for this reason we would rather discourage the use of this method to obtain @xmath39 .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we present a summary of recent estimates for @xmath39 , based on either eq .",
    "( [ numform ] ) ( default ) or eq .",
    "( [ romeform ] ) .",
    "( we use here only estimates based on lattice calculations of @xmath31 and @xmath37 . ) it is evident that there is remarkable agreement on the hadronic parameters @xmath31 and @xmath37 , and that the spread of results is mainly caused by different values of @xmath16 or the use of eq .",
    "( [ romeform ] ) . in the following",
    "we first assess the theoretical uncertainties of the nlo calculation and then present our best evaluation , given as `` this summary '' in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the current theoretical uncertainties are as follows :    @xmath40\\hline \\mbox{this summary } &   0.9\\pm 0.1 & 1.25\\pm 0.1 & 230\\pm 10\\%   & 9.3\\%\\\\   \\hline \\end{array}\\ ] ]    * _ residual scale dependence .",
    "_ this dependence arises from residual effects in the matching of the nlo wilson coefficients for @xmath2 to the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath17 computed on the lattice , and from the matching of the nlo wilson coefficients for @xmath2 to the wilson coefficients of the @xmath41 weak effective hamiltonian . here",
    "we estimate only the second source of scale dependence , using the coefficients for scales @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath28gev ) given in @xcite .",
    "we then find @xmath44\\!-2.7\\%\\!\\end{array}\\right)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{f_{b_s}}{230\\,\\mbox{mev}}\\right)^{\\!2 }    \\frac{m_{b_s}^2 b_s(m_b)}{(\\bar{m}_b+\\bar{m}_s)^2}.\\ ] ] * _ normalization .",
    "_ there is an overall normalization error in eq .",
    "( [ numform ] ) , which results from the uncertainty in the measurement of the semi - leptonic branching fraction and from the value of the @xmath45 quark mass .",
    "we estimate this error to be @xmath46 . * _ @xmath12-correction . _",
    "the second major source of theoretical uncertainty originates from the term `` @xmath47 '' in eq .",
    "( [ numform ] ) , which has been obtained using the factorization assumption for the power - suppressed four - quark matrix elements @xcite . to estimate this uncertainty , we introduce four parameters that measure the deviation from the factorization approximation , corresponding to the four independent operators at order @xmath12 .",
    "we find that all @xmath12 effects add essentially constructively , so that there is no reason to suspect an amplification of corrections to the factorization approximation as a result of cancellations in the factorized expression .",
    "we then find @xmath48 where @xmath49 parametrizes a typical deviation from the factorization approximation , corresponding to quantities like @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in leading power .",
    "there exists no reliable information on violations of the factorization assumption for the matrix elements in question , but experience with leading order matrix elements suggests that @xmath52 is a reasonable upper limit .",
    "* _ @xmath31 and @xmath37 .",
    "_ substantial work has been invested in controlling the nonperturbative parameters at leading power .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows that the results are rather consistent with each other ( the number 1.07 in the first line is obsolete ) and suggests that @xmath53 we note that at the present stage the uncertainty in @xmath7 and @xmath17 has become a minor factor , the dominant ones coming from residual scale dependence and @xmath12 corrections .",
    "we can now combine these uncertainties with eq .",
    "( [ numform ] ) to obtain our final result @xmath54   & & \\hspace*{4.3 cm } -\\ , ( 7.8\\pm 1.8\\%)\\big ] \\nonumber\\\\[-0.0 cm ] & = & \\big(9.3^{+3.4}_{-4.6}\\big)\\%.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final number is obtained by adding all errors in squares and assigning a @xmath46 uncertainty to @xmath55mev .",
    "it is worth noting that this number is considerably larger than the result obtained in @xcite for two reasons : first , the overall normalization obtained from eq .",
    "( [ romeform ] ) is about 25% smaller compared to that of eq .",
    "( [ numform ] ) with @xmath55mev , since the global ckm fit prefers a smaller value of the @xmath7 meson decay constant ; second , ref .",
    "@xcite uses @xmath56gev , which increases the @xmath12 correction by almost a factor 1.5 .",
    "despite ( or because of ? ) extensive work on radiative and @xmath12 corrections the theoretical prediction of the width difference of the @xmath0 mass eigenstates remains rather uncertain .",
    "this is due to an unfortunate conspiracy of negative corrections at next - to - leading order in @xmath15 and in the heavy quark expansion .",
    "the large error exhibited by eq .",
    "( [ update ] ) makes it improbable that new physics would be first observed in the width difference , since a new physics contribution to the @xmath0-@xmath3 mixing phase large enough to cause an effect larger than the theoretical uncertainty would rather been seen elsewhere , for instance as a time - dependent asymmetry in @xmath57 .",
    "is further improvement possible ?",
    "it is conceivable that future lattice calculations will reduce further the uncertainty in @xmath7 and @xmath17 , but the impact of the present uncertainty in these parameters on the total error is no longer dominant .",
    "some improvement could be possible concerning the overall normalisation , but this effect can also not be substantial",
    ". the obvious targets for improvement are therefore    * scale dependence : its reduction would require the calculation or estimate of @xmath58 corrections .",
    "this appears to be a hard endeavour , and it would also require the computation of three - loop anomalous dimensions of the weak effective hamiltonian . * @xmath12 corrections : obviously , the relevant matrix elements should be computed on the lattice to rid the calculation from the factorization assumption .",
    "such a calculation does not appear likely soon , given the familiar difficulties with higher dimension operators .",
    "since the @xmath12 corrections are large , one may think of computing the @xmath15 corrections to them . while this is feasible",
    ", the effort is probably too large as long as the matrix elements of the operators are not known accurately enough .",
    "it therefore appears that @xmath14 will remain considerably uncertain for the foreseeable future .",
