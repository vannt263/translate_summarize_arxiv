    "_ = 33 transitions in are widely detected in solar extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) spectra covering the @xmath0200400   wavelength interval ( dere 1978 ; thomas & neupert 1994 ) .",
    "the 3_s_@xmath4 @xmath5s3_s_3_p _ @xmath5p resonance line at 284   is one of the most intense emission features in the solar euv spectrum , and has also been widely observed in stellar coronal sources by the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( euve ) satellite ( laming & drake 1999 ) .",
    "bely & blaha ( 1968 ) first noted the potential of euv lines of as diagnostics for the emitting plasma , and since then many authors have calculated emission line intensities for this ion and compared these with solar observations ( see , for example , kastner & bhatia 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "however also shows a rich emission line spectrum in the soft x - ray region , @xmath05080  , arising from _",
    "_ = 34 transitions .",
    "by contrast to the euv lines , there has been little work on the soft x - ray transitions in the astrophysical literature , probably as a result of the limited availability of high quality solar spectra for this wavelength region .",
    "there were several rocket - borne flights in the 1960 s which covered the soft x - ray region , but these detected few or no transitions ( see , for example , austin et al .",
    "1966 ; widing & sandlin 1968 ; behring , cohen , & feldman 1972 ; malinovsky & heroux 1973 ) .",
    "the most detailed measurements of the _ n _ = 34 lines in to date were made by the xsst spectrograph during a rocket flight in 1982 ( acton et al .",
    "1985 ) . however , even these observations have only been subject to a brief analysis by bhatia , mason , & blancard ( 1997 ) , as part of their work to produce a large atomic dataset for this ion .",
    "finally , campbell & brickhouse ( 2001 ) presented preliminary results from an investigation of and lines in _ chandra _ x - ray spectra of the late - type coronally - active stars capella ( g1  iii + g8  iii ) and procyon ( f5  iv ) .",
    "in this paper we use the most recent atomic physics calculations for to generate soft x - ray line ratios for a wide range of electron temperatures and densities applicable to coronal plasmas .",
    "we compare these in detail with the xsst observations of action et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , to assess the usefulness of the transitions as plasma diagnostics .",
    "however , in addition we analyse a _",
    "spectrum of capella constructed from multiple observations .",
    "this co - added x - ray spectrum has one of the highest signal - to - noise ratios ever achieved for an astrophysical coronal plasma in the @xmath025175 soft x - ray region , hence allowing us to perform an investigation of the = 34 lines in an astronomical source other than the sun .",
    "the capella spectrum is also made freely available , to encourage further research on the soft x - ray spectral region .",
    "for example , in conjunction with the published xsst solar line list , the capella data should be useful for reliably identifying new emission features .",
    "in addition , there are potentially many useful diagnostic lines in the soft x - ray wavelength range , especially for solar flare - type plasmas ( see , for example , brown et al . 1986 ; feldman et al . 1992 ) , and hence further exploration and assessment of these is warranted .",

    "_ and 3_s_4_f _ configurations .",
    "energies of these levels were obtained from churilov et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , churilov , levashov , & wyart ( 1989 ) , litzen & redfors ( 1987 ) , sugar & corliss ( 1985 ) and aggarwal , keenan , & msezane ( 2003 ) .",
    "electron impact excitation rates for transitions among all the levels discussed above were taken from aggarwal et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for einstein a - coefficients , the calculations of deb , aggarwal , & msezane ( 1999 ) were employed for allowed and intercombination lines .",
    "radiative rates for forbidden transitions have also been taken from the work of deb et al . , although the data were not included in the published paper for conciseness .",
    "however we note that they are available from one of the authors ( k.aggarwal@qub.ac.uk ) on request .",
    "our a - value results for the forbidden transitions are , in general , very similar to those calculated by others , such as bhatia et al .",
    "proton impact excitation is only important for transitions among the 3_s_3_p _",
    "@xmath1p levels of , and in the present analysis we have employed the calculations of landman & brown ( 1979 ) .    using the atomic data discussed above in conjunction with a recently updated version of the statistical equilibrium code of dufton ( 1977 ) , relative level populations and hence emission line strengths were calculated for a wide range of electron temperatures ( t@xmath8 ) and densities ( n@xmath8 ) .",
    "details of the procedures involved and approximations made may be found in dufton , and dufton et al .",
    "( 1978 ) .    in figures",
    "17 we plot the theoretical emission line intensity ratios r@xmath6 through r@xmath9 , which are defined in table 1 .",
    "these ratios are shown as a function of t@xmath8 and/or n@xmath8 for a range of temperatures ( t@xmath8 = 10@xmath1010@xmath11 k ) over which has a fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium of n()/(fe ) @xmath12 10@xmath13 ( mazzotta et al .",
    "1998 ) , and for values of n@xmath8 (= 10@xmath1410@xmath15 cm@xmath13 ) appropriate to solar and stellar coronal plasmas . in some instances ,",
    "the ratios are predicted to be insensitive to electron density over the n@xmath8 interval considered ( for example , r@xmath6 ) , in which case values are only plotted as a function of electron temperature at a single density .",
    "others , such as r@xmath3 , are weakly dependent on density , and hence are shown for a limited range of n@xmath8 values .",
    "however those ratios which vary significantly with t@xmath8 and n@xmath8 , such as r@xmath17 , are plotted over the full range of plasma parameters .",
    "we note that the r@xmath18 ratio is not shown in the figures , as it has the same temperature and density dependence as r@xmath19 , owing to common upper levels , but with    r@xmath18 = 2.95 @xmath20 r@xmath19",
    ".    given errors in the adopted atomic data of typically @xmath2110%  ( see the references above ) , we would expect the theoretical ratios to be accurate to better than @xmath2120% .",
    "the ratios in figures 17 are given relative to the 59.40 transition , as this feature is the cleanest and most reliably detected emission line in the soft x - ray spectral region .",
    "this has been checked by a search of line lists , and also by generating synthetic spectra with the latest version ( 4.2 ) of the chianti database ( dere et al .",
    "1997 ; young et al . 2003 ) , which confirm that no blending species is present which has a line intensity greater than 2%  that of the 59.40 feature . however we note that theoretical ratios involving any line pair are available electronically from one of the authors ( fpk ) on request .",
    "an inspection of figures 17 reveals that several of the ratios are sensitive to variations in the electron temperature and/or density .",
    "for example , r@xmath22 varies by a factor of about 2.0 between t@xmath8 = 10@xmath10 and 10@xmath11 k , while being insensitive to the adopted electron density .",
    "similarly , r@xmath9 changes by a factor of 3.4 over the ( relatively narrow ) density interval of n@xmath8 = 10@xmath2310@xmath24  cm@xmath13 at t@xmath8 = 10@xmath25 k. hence the ratios should , in principle , provide useful t@xmath8 and/or n@xmath8diagnostics for the emitting region of a plasma .",
    "we note that the present theoretical line ratios are generally not excessively different from other recent calculations .",
    "for example , at t@xmath8 = 10@xmath25 k and n@xmath8 = 10@xmath14 cm@xmath13 , we calculate r@xmath6 = 0.58 compared to r@xmath6 = 0.68 from chianti and r@xmath6 = 0.38 from bhatia et al .",
    "similarly , at these plasma parameters , we find r@xmath22 = 3.6 compared to r@xmath22 = 3.5 ( chianti ) and r@xmath22 = 3.3 ( bhatia et al . ) .",
    "however a notable exception is the r@xmath3 ratio , for which we estimate r@xmath3 = 0.17 at t@xmath8 = 10@xmath25 k and n@xmath8 = 10@xmath14 cm@xmath13 , and bhatia et al .",
    "calculate r@xmath3 = 0.11 .",
    "by contrast , chianti indicates that r@xmath3 = 0.019 , a factor of 69 lower than the other results .",
    "this discrepancy arises due to the adopted a - value for the 3_s_@xmath4 @xmath5s3_s_4_p _ @xmath1p@xmath6 transition . in our calculations",
    ", we use a = 8.1@xmath2010@xmath26 s@xmath27 from deb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and bhatia et al .",
    "employ their own value of a = 8.4@xmath2010@xmath26 s@xmath27 .",
    "however the chianti database uses a = 1.5@xmath2010@xmath26 s@xmath27 from griffin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which is significantly smaller than the other two calculations .",
    "furthermore , deb et al . undertook two independent calculations of radiative rates for , using the civ3 atomic structure code of hibbert ( 1975 ) and the grasp code of dyall et al .",
    "their a - values for the 3_s_@xmath4 @xmath5s3_s_4_p _",
    "@xmath1p@xmath6 transition from the two codes differ by only 11% , and as a consequence they assess that their calculations should be accurate to better than 20% . given this , and the excellent agreement with the result of bhatia et al . , who also performed an independent calculation with the superstructure code of eissner et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , we therefore believe that the griffin et al .",
    "a - value is in error and should be re - evaluated .",
    "we compare our line ratio calculations with two datasets , namely that for a solar flare obtained with a rocket - borne spectrograph , and a composite spectrum for capella observed with the _ chandra _ satellite .",
    "these datasets are discussed separately below .",
    "the solar spectrum analysed in the present paper is that of an m - class flare , recorded on kodak 10107 emulsion by an x - ray spectrograph ( xsst ) during a rocket flight on 1982 july 13 .",
    "these observations spanned the wavelength range 1197  , at a spectral resolution of 0.02  , and covered a solid angle of approximately 625 arcsec@xmath4 , centered on or near the brightest source of x - rays .",
    "the xsst made two exposures , one of 54 s beginning at 16:33:50 ut and the other of 145 s commencing at 16:35:35 ut .",
    "unfortunately , a failure of the mechanism to move the film more than one mm between the two exposures resulted in their being nearly superimposed on the same plate .",
    "however , a careful analysis allowed the two spectra to be separated , so that analysis of the data could be performed , and the observations presented here are for the 145 s exposure .",
    "further details of the xsst instrument may be found in brown et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and bruner et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , while the observations are discussed in acton et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .",
    "it would clearly have been preferable to model the xsst observations in detail using profile fitting methods , as for the _ chandra _ data ( see   3.2 ) .",
    "this was unfortunately not possible as the original xsst spectra are no longer available , following the retirement of several key staff involved in the mission .",
    "consequently , only the published line list and intensities for xsst are now accessible .",
    "we have searched for emission lines in the xsst spectrum , using the identifications of acton et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and also the nist database and other line lists , such as the atomic line list of peter van hoofpvh/ ] .",
    "in table 1 we list the transitions found in the spectrum , along with their measured wavelengths .",
    "the intensity of the 59.40   line of measured by acton et al .",
    "( 1985 ) in the xsst spectrum is given in table 2 ; observed intensities of the other transitions may be inferred from this using the line ratios given in the table ( see   2 ) .",
    "acton et al .",
    "( 1985 ) note that a strong second - order spectrum falling between 2550   is evident in the xsst observations , and that the effects of scattered light and double exposure made the reduction of the data difficult .",
    "however although difficult , acton et al . did succeed in producing a well - calibrated spectrum and hence reliable measurements of emission line intensities .",
    "evidence for this comes from , for example , our previous analysis of emission lines in the xsst spectrum ( keenan et al .",
    "we found that , for 6 out of 7 line ratios involving transitions in the 4153   wavelength region , agreement between theory and observation is excellent , with differences that average only 11% . for the sole line ratio which shows a large discrepancy between theory and observation ,",
    "this is explained by a known blend with a transition .",
    "the lines in the xsst spectrum should in fact be more reliably measured than those for , as the former lie outside the 2550   range affected by the second - order spectrum .",
    "brown et al . ( 1986 ) and keenan et al .",
    "note that the relative intensities of lines in the xsst spectrum similar in strength to the transitions discussed here should be accurate to about @xmath2120% , and hence line ratios to @xmath2130% .",
    "the observed line ratios in table 2 have therefore been assigned a uniform @xmath2130%uncertainty .",
    "capella is the mainstay target for calibrating and monitoring the _ chandra _ transmission grating spectrometer dispersion relation . as such ,",
    "it is currently observed approximately every 12 months using the letg+hrc - s combination .",
    "the capella observations analysed here were obtained by the _ chandra _ low energy transmission grating spectrograph ( letgs ) , employing the high resolution camera spectroscopic detector ( hrc - s ) in its standard configuration , yielding spectra with a resolution of approximately 0.06   .",
    "( see weisskopf et al .",
    "2003 for a recent overview of the _ chandra _ instrumentation and its in - flight performance ) .",
    "we have taken advantage of the multiple observations of capella accrued to date to construct a composite spectrum with the highest signal - to - noise ratio possible .",
    "the different observations utilised , together with their dates of acquisition and exposure times , are listed in table 3 .",
    "observations from 2002 were obtained at significantly different off - axis angles , and were not included in this analysis .",
    "data were uniformly processed and spectra extracted using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software version 3.1 .",
    "photon event lists were also filtered in detector pulse height in order to remove particle - induced background events .",
    "the final extracted co - added spectrum is shown in figure 8 , and we note that this is freely available from one of the authors ( jjd ) electronically on request . in figure 9",
    "we plot the 5075   portion of the spectrum , as this contains all of the soft x - ray lines identified in capella .",
    "unfortunately , the spectrum is too noisy at longer wavelengths for other ( weak ) features to be detected .",
    "the capella spectrum was analysed using the pintofale idl software suite ( kashyap & drake 2000 ) .",
    "line fluxes were measured by fitting `` modified lorentzian '' , or moffat , functions of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the amplitude and @xmath30 a characteristic line width . for a value of @xmath31 , it has been found that @xmath32 reproduces the line response function of the letg+hrc - s instrument to the photometric accuracy of lines with a few thousand counts or less ( drake 2004 ) .",
    "uncertainties were estimated using a monte carlo sampling of the free parameters in the line fits .",
    "free parameters are , in general , the line width , position and amplitude , although for some of the fitting of poorer quality spectral features we constrained the line width to the value 0.065   found for nearby clean lines .",
    "continua were estimated locally by eye for each fit .",
    "line positions were allowed to vary from their reference positions by @xmath330.05  , this being dictated by the imaging characteristics of the hrc - s detector . as discussed by chung et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the hrc - s exhibits small - scale imaging non - linearities that vary over the detector , and which can displace a spectral line from its true position by up to 0.05  .",
    "while this effect can be calibrated to some extent using bright , well - known spectral lines , the wavelength range of interest to this study is devoid of such transitions , and the characteristics of the imaging non - linearities have not been well defined in the relevant regions of the detector . for lines closely spaced in wavelength ,",
    "the relative separations of the lines were kept fixed to their reference values , while the position of the group was allowed to vary . in the case of the group of lines in the 69.470.2   range ( figure 10 ) ,",
    "the wavelengths of the 69.93 , 69.98 and 70.05   transitions were decoupled from the stronger 69.65   feature .",
    "we found the best - fit location of the former group to be displaced by 0.04   from the reference position , while the latter line lies very close to its expected location .",
    "the relatively unexplored and complex nature of the crowded soft x - ray spectrum in the 5075   wavelength range poses particular challenges for estimating line fluxes .",
    "in addition to the lines from the @xmath34 shells of abundant elements such as mg , si , s and ar , and the @xmath35 shell of fe , lines from shorter wavelengths arising from higher spectral orders are also present in this range .",
    "unlike the _ chandra _ acis ccd detector , the hrc - s microchannel plate detector possesses no energy resolution of its own and overlapping spectral orders can not be separated .",
    "prior to performing line fits we therefore looked for the presence of significant blends from known strong lines in higher orders .",
    "the letgs is designed with a grating bar - to - space ratio of 1:1 , which results in some suppression of even orders .",
    "the most important order for line blends in the 5075   range is the 3rd , which has an efficiency of about 10%  that of 1st order .",
    "two of the lines in our list coincided reasonably closely with noteable 3rd order lines : @xmath36 , which lies slightly less than one line width away from 3rd order @xmath37 ; and @xmath38 , which lies a line width away from 3rd order  @xmath39 .",
    "the forbidden line is quite strong in the spectrum of capella , and @xmath36 was therefore discarded .",
    "however @xmath40 is a much weaker line , of which there is no obvious sign in 3rd order .",
    "it arises between the levels @xmath41@xmath42 and @xmath43@xmath44 , and occurs because of configuration mixing ( drake et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "spectral orders 4 and 5 have similar efficiencies of 23  %  that for 1st order .",
    "the + @xmath45 blend coincides in 4th order with  @xmath46 , and was included in the spectral fit with the relative wavelengths of the two components kept fixed . while there are no other strong lines blended with our features in 4th and 5th orders ,",
    "there is a slew of weaker lines from @xmath47 transitions in the _",
    "n _ = 2 shells of fe and ni that fall in the 5075    range .",
    "these transitions give rise to an additional pseudocontinuum , that we treated empirically through the estimation of a local continuum for each line or line group .",
    "such empirical local continua were also guided by the broad - band `` by eye '' continuum , that can be seen in figure 8 .    in the fitting of some lines ,",
    "neighbouring features blend in with the line wings . in most cases , these blending features are not clean lines that could be unambiguously identified with particular transitions of accurately known wavelengths , but are often complex blends with some unidentified contributions . to account for these unidentified transitions in the measured fluxes of our lines of interest , we added line components in an ad hoc fashion until the profiles of blended features could be empirically matched .",
    "examples are shown in figure 10 , while the observed line ratios are listed in table 4 , along with their associated errors . in table 5",
    "we list the wavelengths of the additional ad hoc line components .    as with the xsst observations (   3.1 ) , the measured intensity of the 59.40   line",
    "is given in table 4 , and those of the other transitions may be inferred from this using the line ratio values .",
    "it should be kept in mind in the interpretation of the measured fluxes that they are also prone to uncertainty caused by hidden blends of unidentified lines . for such cases",
    ", there is an expectation that the measured fluxes might be systematically too high .",
    "in tables 2 and 4 we list the observed emission line ratios from the xsst solar flare spectrum and the _ chandra _ capella observations , respectively . also shown in the tables",
    "are the theoretical results from figures 17 at the temperature of maximum fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium for , t@xmath8 = 10@xmath25 k ( mazzotta et al .",
    "1998 ) , and at electron densities derived for the solar and capella observations from emission line ratios in ( brown et al .",
    "1986 ; phillips et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the temperature - sensitive @xmath48-ratio for in the xsst and capella data indicates that t@xmath8 = 10@xmath25 k in both features , similar to that of maximum fractional abundance for . in the case of capella , whose coronal emission measure distribution rises quite steeply to a peak at t@xmath8 = 6@xmath2010@xmath49  k ( see , for example , brickhouse et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is possible that this @xmath48-ratio slightly underestimates the mean temperature of line formation , as was found empirically by testa , drake & peres ( 2004 ) for a sample of active stars .",
    "however , the ion populations of both and peak at very similar temperatures , and hence the density should still accurately reflect that of the emitting region of the plasma .",
    "we have also verified that the slightly higher temperatures of line formation that would result from the relatively steep capella emission measure distribution do not significantly change the predicted line ratios from those listed in table  4 .",
    "the error bars on the theoretical results are based on the estimated @xmath2120%  accuracy of the line ratio calculations ( see   2 ) .",
    "an inspection of table 2 reveals very good agreement between the xsst observations and the theoretical predictions for the ratios r@xmath19 and r@xmath22 .",
    "this indicates that the 63.97 and 69.65   lines are well detected in the xsst spectrum , and must be relatively free from blends .",
    "in particular , we confirm the identification by bhatia et al . of the 63.97   feature as the 3_p_@xmath4 @xmath5d3_s_4_f _",

    "( 1985 ) . these authors also identify the 69.65    line as being partially due to and transitions , with an unknown feature responsible for most of the line flux .",
    "however our result for r@xmath22 clearly shows that the line is primarily the 3_s_3_p _ @xmath5p3_s_4_s _ @xmath5s transition , as suggested by bhatia et al .",
    "we have confirmed this by generating a synthetic spectrum using chianti , which indicates that the 2_s_@xmath42_p_@xmath1 @xmath7s2_s_@xmath42_p_@xmath43_s _ @xmath7p@xmath52 line only contributes about 15%  to the total 69.65   flux , and that no transitions are present .",
    "similarly , the observed r@xmath6 , r@xmath53 , r@xmath54 , r@xmath9 and r@xmath18 ratios in table 2 are only slightly larger than the theoretical values , indicating that the 52.91 , 69.98 , 70.05 , 73.47 and 82.76 lines must be mostly due to .",
    "indeed , within the observational and theoretical errors in the line ratios , all the observed fluxes may arise from this ion .",
    "this is supported by the chianti synthetic spectrum , which predicts no significant blending species for the 52.91 , 69.98 and 70.05   features , and contributions of only about 10%  from 1_s_@xmath42_p _ @xmath4p@xmath551 _ s_@xmath44_d _ @xmath4d@xmath56 and 20%  from 1_s_2_p _ @xmath5p1_s_3_s _ @xmath5s to the 73.47 and 82.76   lines , respectively .",
    "our classification of the 82.76   feature as the 3_s_3_d _ @xmath1d@xmath23 _",
    "@xmath1p@xmath3 line is , to our knowledge , the first time this transition has been identified in an astrophysical source .",
    "the good agreement between theory and observation for the above line ratios indicates that they should provide useful diagnostics for the emitting region of a plasma .",
    "in particular , r@xmath22 , r@xmath53 , r@xmath54 and r@xmath9 are all temperature and/or density sensitive , and hence with careful use should allow these parameters to be derived .",
    "for example , r@xmath22 could be employed to evaluate t@xmath8 , as it does not vary with n@xmath8 ( figure 1 ) , and the latter could then be determined from r@xmath54 or r@xmath9 ( figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the observed values of r@xmath3 , r@xmath2 , r@xmath17 , r@xmath57 and r@xmath58 in the xsst spectrum are all significantly larger than theory , implying that the 53.11 , 55.78 , 56.17 , 66.25 and 69.93 lines of are blended to varying degrees . for the 53.11   feature",

    "similarly , a comparison of theory and observation for r@xmath57 indicates that only contributes about 10%   to the intensity of the 66.25   feature .",
    "this is in agreement with chianti , which predicts that 90%  of the observed flux is due to the 3_d _",
    "@xmath4d@xmath564_f _ @xmath4f@xmath52 line .",
    "by contrast , it is not clear from chianti what the blending species are for the 56.17 and 69.93   lines , with no transitions predicted to have intensities more than 10%  those of the relevant features .",
    "it is however possible that the blending may be due to strong lines observed by xsst in second- or third - order , which are appearing in first - order at these wavelengths .",
    "for example , in the case of the 56.17   line , chianti indicates no strong transitions in second - order ( i.e. around 28.09  ) , but the intense 1_s_@xmath42_s _ @xmath4s1_s_@xmath43_p _ @xmath4p@xmath55 transition is predicted in third - order ( 18.73  ) .",
    "similarly , for the 69.93 line there is a predicted third - order feature at 23.31  , namely the 2_s_2_p_@xmath4 @xmath4p@xmath562_s_2_p_3_d _ @xmath4d@xmath52 transition .",
    "there are unfortunately no lines in the xsst spectrum for comparison purposes , but there is a transition at 21.45   ( 2_s_@xmath42_p _ @xmath4p@xmath552_s_@xmath43_d _ @xmath4d@xmath56 ) , with an intensity i = 37 photons @xmath59 s@xmath27 arcsec@xmath60 .",
    "however the predicted chianti intensity ratio is i(23.31 )/i(21.45  ) @xmath62 10@xmath13 , indicating that the 23.31   transition can not be responsible for the blend in the 69.93   line .",
    "clearly , the identification of the blends for the 56.17 and 69.93   features will require further work .    in the case of the _ chandra _ observations of capella ,",
    "agreement between theory and experiment in table 4 is very good for the majority of the line ratios . where there are discrepancies , such as for r@xmath58 , these tend to mirror those found for the xsst spectrum , with the observed value being somewhat larger than theory , indicative of some blending .",
    "however , in most instances the observed line ratios actually show smaller discrepancies with theory than do the xsst results . to a certain extent",
    ", such agreement may be judged to be unsurprising , as in our analysis of the capella observations we added line components in an ad hoc fashion until the profiles of blending features could be empirically matched ( see   3.2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , our results indicate that profile fitting of the _ chandra _ data , rather than simple measurements of emission line intensities , does allow the reliable detection of soft x - ray features in the 5075   wavelength range .",
    "indeed , our work represents ( to our knowledge ) the first time that the = 34 lines have been identified in an astrophysical source other than the sun .",
    "hopefully , our results will encourage the future use of these lines as plasma diagnostics for this spectral region .    in summary",
    ", we have performed a detailed analysis of soft x - ray lines in the @xmath05283   wavelength region , observed in the solar spectrum by the xsst spectrograph , and confirmed identifications for several emission features and also detected a new transition .",
    "additionally , the lines have been measured in _",
    "observations of capella , and appear to provide potentially useful plasma diagnostics .",
    "we therefore hope that our work will stimulate renewed interest in this relatively unexplored spectral region , in particular through our provision of the co - added _ chandra _ spectrum for capella , which are probably the highest signal - to - noise data available .",
    "many dozens of lines in the solar soft x - ray spectrum are without identifications , and the capella spectrum ( in combination with the xsst solar line list ) should provide an aid to the identification of soft x - ray transitions and the investigation of their usefulness as plasma diagnostics",
    ". this will be important for future space missions , and in particular the euv variability experiment ( eve ) , which is part of the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) , due for launch in 2008 .",
    "one of the eve instruments is the multiple euv grating spectrograph ( megs ) , which will observe the 501050   region at a spectral resolution of 1  .",
