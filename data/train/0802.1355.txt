    "the far - infrared spectroscopy of superconducting mgb@xmath0 seems to indicate the presence of a single gap @xmath8 with the ratio 2@xmath9 significantly below the bcs value of 3.53 ( see a recent review by kuzmenko @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to this finding , the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , the tunneling spectroscopy @xcite , the raman spectroscopy @xcite and the heat capacity measurements @xcite on magnesium diboride have all established two distinct superconducting gaps @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath4- and @xmath2-bands . since the far - infrared measurements @xcite were performed on films with reduced superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 , we investigate the possibility that the interband non - magnetic impurity scattering , which is known to reduce the transition temperature of multi - band superconductors @xcite , is responsible for the observation of a single gap .",
    "namely , schopohl and scharnberg @xcite found that the interband impurity scattering produces a common low temperature gap @xmath8 in both bands of a two - band superconductor such that the quasiparticle densities of states in each band vanish at energies below @xmath8 in the low temperature limit , figure 1 . in the limit of small interband impurity scattering rate ,",
    "the common gap is just above the lower of the two gaps in the clean system ( figure 1a ) .",
    "as the interband impurity scattering rate increases the common gap grows in size ( figure 1b ) , but remains lower than the larger of the two gaps in the clean system , and for a sufficiently large interband impurity scattering rate the order parameters ( the gap functions ) in both bands become the same ( the anderson theorem @xcite ) .",
    "the growth of the common gap with the interband impurity scattering rate is accompanied by progressive smearing of the peaks in the quasiparticle densities of states in the two bands , figure 1 . since the frequency ( @xmath12 ) dependent conductivity @xmath13 is a functional of both the normal and the anomalous quasiparticle densities of states",
    ", one would expect the frequency dependence of @xmath13 to be modified compared to what is predicted by a straightforward application of the mattis - bardeen theory @xcite which uses the bcs form for the quasiparticle densities of states .",
    "in particular , terahertz time - domain measurements of kaindl _ et al . _ on mgb@xmath0 films @xcite found that the real part of @xmath13 increased more slowly for @xmath12 just above twice the gap than what was predicted by the mattis - bardeen theory .",
    "this finding is significant since the bcs - type mattis - bardeen theory describes quite well the low frequency dependence of @xmath14 even for a strong coupling superconductor pb ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the observed @xmath13 of mgb@xmath0 films @xcite is consistent with multi - band superconductivity in this compound in the presence of a sufficiently strong interband impurity scattering .",
    "the microwave conductivity of mgb@xmath0 was measured in @xcite with different results . in @xcite , the normalized real part of the conductivity at 17.9 ghz ( @xmath12=0.074 mev ) measured on the @xmath15-axis oriented mgb@xmath0 films had a broad maximum at a temperature of about 0.6@xmath1 , instead of the usual coherence peak seen in the dirty limit just below the @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the data of lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained at 8.5 ghz ( @xmath12=0.035 mev ) on polycrystalline mgb@xmath0 films with the @xmath1s of 39.3 k and 36.3 k showed rather sharp coherence peaks at about 0.9@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the results obtained on the film with the higher @xmath1 showed a second , lower , peak at about 0.53@xmath1 which appears to be sharper than the broad oval feature seen in @xcite ( see figures 3 and 4 in @xcite ) . upon",
    "ion - milling the second peak became more of a shoulder at about 0.6@xmath1 , the peak at 0.9@xmath1 became broadened , but increased in size , and the @xmath1 dropped from 39.4 k to 36.3 k. the results for the normalized microwave conductivity obtained in @xcite at 19 ghz ( @xmath12=0.079 mev ) on mgb@xmath0 and mg@xmath16al@xmath17b@xmath0 pellets resembled more those found in @xcite .",
    "the al - doped sample displayed more pronounced shoulder at about 0.4@xmath1 - 0.5@xmath1 and a more pronounced coherence peak just below the @xmath1 than the magnesium diboride sample .",
    "here we also investigate theoretically the effect of impurity scattering on the temperature ( @xmath18 ) dependence of the microwave conductivity @xmath19 of a two - band superconductor .",
    "we find that the shape of @xmath19 depends strongly on both the intraband and the interband impurity scattering rates .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we write down the equations for the optical conductivity of each band which include explicitly and implicitly the intraband and the interband impurity scattering rates .",
    "section 3 contains our results for @xmath20 obtained using realistic interaction parameters for mgb@xmath0 and a comparison of experimental results @xcite with our theoretical predictions .",
    "the same section also contains our results for the temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity and their comparison with experiments @xcite .",
    "section 4 contains a summary . in the appendix we provide a connection between the main results of @xcite which used the bcs treatment of the same problem at zero temperature and the present work",
    "the optical conductivity of a two - band superconductor with non - magnetic impurities was first considered by sung and wong @xcite .",
    "they used the bcs treatment of the pairing interactions in two isotropic bands and included the @xmath21-wave impurity scattering in the self - consistent second born approximation . the general expression for the zero temperature optical conductivity of a two - band superconductor with impurities",
    "was developed using the standard linear response theory in the conserving approximation @xcite . since the electron self - energies were obtained in the self - consistent second born approximation , only the ladder impurity diagrams had to be considered in evaluating the current - current correlator @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "however , the graphs where the interband scattering impurity lines cross the current vertex vanish because of the assumed isotropy of the bands and impurity scattering matrix elements @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the paramagnetic part of the electromagnetic response kernel is simply the sum of the contributions from individual bands . in terms of concrete quantitative predictions , they only pointed out that the absorption threshold should increase with increasing interband impurity scattering rate / impurity concentration , figure 1 .",
    "here we generalize the results in @xcite to include the strong - coupling effects because it is known @xcite,@xcite,@xcite that the weak - coupling bcs treatment of the effect of interband impurity scattering @xcite badly overestimates the rate of suppression of @xmath1 in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "also , the bcs treatment requires an unphysical value of the debye cutoff of 7.5 mev @xcite , while it is known that the superconductivity of mgb@xmath0 is mainly driven by electron coupling to the optical b - b bond stretching modes at about 74 mev .    as in @xcite",
    ", we will make the assumption of isotropic bands and interactions ( electron - phonon , screened coulomb and electron - impurity ) .",
    "the assumed isotropy of the interaction parameters implies that there are no vertex corrections to current vertices in the current - current correlator @xmath22 @xcite and , as in @xcite , the conductivity is simply the sum of conductivities of separate bands .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath23 conductivity @xmath24 of a band @xmath25 in the superconducting state is performed in the standard way ( see , for example , a pedagogical account in @xcite and the references therein ) and one finds the usual result @xcite    @xmath26\\right\\}\\>,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 . here , @xmath28 is the square of the plasma frequency in the band n , and the real parts of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are normalized normal and anomalous quasiparticle densities of states , respectively , in the band @xmath25 .",
    "the quasiparticle energy in the band @xmath25 , @xmath31 , appearing in the denominators in ( [ conductivity ] ) is defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total renormalization function for the band @xmath25 which includes the intraband and the interband electron - phonon interaction and impurity scattering , and @xmath34 is the total gap function ( renormalized pairing self - energy @xcite ) in the band @xmath25 which depends on the intraband and the interband electron - phonon interaction and screened coulomb interaction and only on the interband impurity scattering ( see below ) . in ( [ dos]- [ energy ] ) and throughout this paper we take the branch of the square root with positive imaginary part and the energy @xmath35 is assumed to have infinitesimal positive imaginary part .    the gap functions @xmath34 and the renormalization functions @xmath33 are obtained by solving the eliashberg equations at finite temperature on the real axis @xcite @xmath36 @xmath37\\left [   f(-\\omega')k_{nm}^{+}(\\omega,\\omega')-f(\\omega')k_{nm}^{+}(\\omega,-\\omega')\\right . \\nonumber",

    "it is customary to make the dependence of the conductivity on the impurity scattering rate more explicit as it enters only the total renormalization function @xcite .",

    "the contributions to the conductivity of the carriers in the two bands depend also on the intraband impurity scattering rates and on the plasma frequencies of the two bands and in the following we choose the values of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 according to a particular set of experiments , guided by the band structure calculations .",
    "however , it should be noted that there is no unique way of determining even just two parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 from the measured conductivity just above the @xmath1 , assuming that the plasma frequencies are as given by the band structure calculations and that the interband scattering rate @xmath76 can be deduced from the @xmath1 of the film and the calculated @xmath1 vs.  @xmath76 curve @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty necessarily makes any detailed comparison with experiments difficult .",
    "thus , we will focus on qualitative changes in the conductivities of the two bands brought about by the two - band superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 in the presence of impurity scattering .      in the experiments of kaindl _",
    "et al . _ on mgb@xmath0",
    "@xcite the @xmath1 of the 100 nm film used for the measurement of @xmath13 was 30.5 k. if one assumes that this reduction in the transition temperature from the maximum value of @xmath83=39.4 k results solely from the interband impurity scattering ( i.  e.  if one ignores any possible changes to the fermi level densities of states @xmath84 and @xmath85 and/or the electron - phonon coupling functions ) one can deduce the value of the interband impurity scattering rate @xmath76 from the @xmath1 vs.  @xmath76 curve calculated in @xcite . in this way we find @xmath76=5@xmath83 , where @xmath83 is the transition temperature of the clean system .",
    "the corresponding normalized quasiparticle densities of states obtained from the solutions of ( [ eli1]-[eli4 ] ) are shown in figure 1b . the measured real part of the normal state conductivity at 40 k was about 8@xmath8610@xmath87m@xmath88 ( see the inset in figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this value is mainly determined by the impurity scattering and one can deduce @xmath81 and @xmath82 by choosing appropriate values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 and making an assumption about the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we chose @xmath80=5.89 ev and @xmath79=4.14 ev calculated in @xcite and assumed @xmath6=7 as suggested by kuzmenko @xcite , which resulted in @xmath3=2.6 ev and @xmath5=0.371 ev .",
    "these choices do not affect the calculated @xmath91 , @xmath92 given by ( [ conductivity ] ) and ( [ nconductivity ] ) but only @xmath93 , with @xmath94 . in figure 2 we show our results for the normalized conductivities at several temperatures and the results obtained by using the single - gap mattis - bardeen theory @xcite ( dashed lines ) . with our interaction parameters described at the beginning of this section and @xmath76=5@xmath83 we obtained for the common low temperature gap , figure 1b , @xmath8=3.875 mev .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath1 was determined from the temperature dependence of the conductivity in the low frequency limit ( see the next subsection ) and we found @xmath1=33.2 k giving 2@xmath9= 2.7 which is higher than the value found in @xcite but still well below the bcs value of 3.53 .",
    "the five temperatures for which we calculated the conductivities in figure 2 were chosen such that they correspond to the same values of @xmath95 considered in @xcite and they are @xmath18=7 k , 19 k , 26 k , 29 k and 32.75 k. the results of mattis - bardeen theory ( dashed lines in figure 2 ) were obtained by taking @xmath8=3.875 mev as the zero temperature gap and assuming that the temperature dependence of the gap is given by the bcs theory as calculated by m \" uhlschlegel @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of our results in figure 2 is that both @xmath96 and @xmath97 increase more slowly above twice the gap than what is predicted by the mattis - bardeen theory , in particular at the lower temperatures .",
    "the reduction in the rate of increase in the normalized real part of the conductivity compared to the prediction of the mattis - bardeen theory is more pronounced for the @xmath4-band than for the @xmath2-band .",
    "the reduced rate of increase in @xmath91 , @xmath92 is related to the smearing of both the normal quasiparticle density of states @xmath98 , figure 1 , and the anomalous quasiparticle density of states @xmath99 by the interband impurity scattering . note that for the interband impurity scattering rate @xmath76=5@xmath83 , which was used to obtain the results in figure 2 , @xmath100 is broadened more than @xmath101 , figure 1b , resulting in a slower increase of @xmath102 compared to @xmath103 .",
    "indeed , in figure 3 we show @xmath103 at a low temperature calculated for @xmath76=0.1@xmath83 , together with the prediction of the mattis - bardeen theory .",
    "for such a small interband impurity scattering rate the smearing in @xmath101 compared to the bcs result @xmath104 is quite small , figure 1a , and in this case the mattis - bardeen theory provides an excellent fit .",
    "we conclude that the observed @xcite single gap and a slower rise in @xmath93 above twice the gap compared to the prediction of the mattis - bardeen theory are consistent with the multi - band superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 in the presence of a sufficiently strong interband impurity scattering .      in figure 4",
    "we show the temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity at 8.5 ghz ( @xmath12=0.035 mev ) calculated from equation ( [ conductivity ] ) using the values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath6 suggested by kuzmenko @xcite : @xmath79=4.14 ev , @xmath80=4.72 ev and @xmath6=7 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 was fitted to the microwave conductivity of 1.26@xmath86 10@xmath105 m measured in @xcite at the transition temperature of the film of mgb@xmath106 with a higher @xmath1 ( @xmath1=39.3 k ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath3=152.6 mev and for different choices of @xmath76 in figure 4 the values of @xmath82 and @xmath81 were adjusted to keep @xmath89 and @xmath90 fixed ( note that @xmath107=1.37 is constant ) . in this way the same microwave conductivity at @xmath1 is obtained for different values of the interband scattering rate .",
    "the results in figure 4 are analogous to what was obtained previously by mitrovi ' c and samokhin @xcite for the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) relaxation rate in two - band superconductors .",
    "this is because both the nmr relaxation rate and the microwave conductivity have the same coherence factors in the single band case . for no interband impurity scattering ( @xmath76=0 )",
    "the microwave conductivity of the @xmath4-band has the usual coherence peak at about 0.9@xmath1 , while the microwave conductivity of the @xmath2-band displays an unusual broad peak , first noted in @xcite at about 0.4@xmath1 - 0.5@xmath1 .",
    "the difference in temperatures of the two coherence peaks is a direct consequence of the difference in the energies at which the low temperature quasiparticle densities of states in the two bands have singularities , figure 1a . for finite interband impurity scattering ,",
    "the transition temperature is reduced with increasing @xmath76 and the size of the coherence peak in the @xmath4-band contribution to the microwave conductivity is reduced for @xmath76 up to about @xmath83 , figure 4a , as a result of the reduction and broadening of the peaks in @xmath100 and @xmath108 .",
    "since the peaks in @xmath101 and @xmath109 are less smeared for low values of @xmath76 than those in the @xmath4-band , figure 1a , the effect of the interband impurity scattering on a broad @xmath2-band coherence peak is small for small @xmath76 .",
    "as @xmath76 grows , @xmath101 and @xmath109 become more broadened and start approaching @xmath100 and @xmath108 , figure 1b , as the difference in the gap functions in the two bands becomes smaller .",
    "the consequence of these changes in @xmath110 and @xmath111 is that the coherence peak in @xmath2-band contribution to the microwave conductivity starts moving closer to the @xmath1 and the shape of @xmath112 for fixed @xmath12 in the microwave range starts resembling that of @xmath113 . in figure 5",
    "we show the microwave conductivities calculated for parameters used in the previous subsection with @xmath76=5@xmath83 .",
    "the shapes of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are qualitatively the same since the peaks in the corresponding densities of states occur at similar energies , figure 1b . as pointed out in @xcite , in the limit of very large @xmath76 ( the anderson limit @xcite )",
    "the gap functions in the two bands become identical leading to identical normal and anomalous quasiparticle densities of states in both bands .",
    "this in turn would imply the usual temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity with the coherence peak at about 0.9@xmath1 , barring extremely strong electron - phonon coupling @xcite .    from figure 4",
    "it is clear that the results of jin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with a broad coherence peak at about 0.6@xmath1 could be obtained with a small interband scattering rate @xmath76 , which is consistent with a rather high @xmath1=39.4 k of their samples @xcite , _ and _ with @xmath3 less than or comparable to @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , in figure 6 we show a series of our results calculated with @xmath76=0.1@xmath83 and @xmath3=0.5@xmath5 ( figure 6a ) , @xmath3=@xmath5 ( figure 6b ) , @xmath3=2@xmath5 ( figure 6c ) , @xmath3= 2.67@xmath5 ( figure 6d ) , @xmath3=4@xmath5 ( figure 6e ) and @xmath3= 6.67@xmath5 ( figure 6f ) .",
    "the dashed curves in figure 6 give the @xmath4-band contributions to the microwave conductivity , dash - dotted curves give the @xmath2-band contributions to the microwave conductivity and the solid lines give the total microwave conductivity .",
    "we used @xmath80=5.89 ev , @xmath79=4.14 ev @xcite and the value of @xmath3 was fitted to the measured microwave conductivity at @xmath1 of 1.37@xmath8610@xmath105 m @xcite assuming @xmath114 . in this way we obtained @xmath3=42.5 mev , 50.9 mev , 68.1 mev , 78.6 mev , 100.9 mev and 145.4 mev for figures 6a through 6f , respectively .",
    "clearly , only the results in figures 6a and 6b are consistent with the experimental observation in @xcite .",

    "we note that the shape of the calculated @xmath4-band contribution to the microwave conductivity is quite similar to that of nb @xcite , which is not surprising since the @xmath4-band electron phonon coupling parameter @xmath67=1.017 is comparable to that of nb .",
    "we have developed strong coupling expressions for the frequency and temperature dependent conductivity of a two - band superconductor which include the intraband and the interband scattering by non - magnetic impurities , assuming isotropic bands and interactions .",
