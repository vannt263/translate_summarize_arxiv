    "the motion of particles in potentials that do not have mirror reflection symmetry has attracted much attention in the last years for several reasons .",
    "the interest extends from fundamental problems concerning the validity of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite to applications in biological @xcite and chemical systems @xcite , as well as for solid - state devices @xcite .",
    "major efforts have been devoted to an understanding of molecular motors , where proteins move in nonsymmetric potentials under the influence of stochastic and/or other forces .",
    "one specific observation for transport in nonsymmetric potentials is the possibility of rectification effects if the forces on the particles are beyond the regime where linear - response theory is applicable @xcite .",
    "rectification effects have been discussed in continuous @xcite as well as in hopping systems @xcite .",
    "if applications of effects of particle motion in nonsymmetric potentials are envisaged then the question arises as to the influence of many - particle effects .",
    "the limit of single - particle motion is rarely realized ; in real systems many particles are present that compete about the sites that can be occupied .",
    "many - particle effects have been studied in continuous nonsymmetric periocic potentials in ref.@xcite , where interesting dependencies of the current on particle concentration and size were found . in this paper",
    "we will investigate hopping motion of lattice - gas particles in nonsymmetric hopping potentials under the influence of strong bias .",
    "we utilize the simple site exclusion model where multiple occupancy of sites is excluded and direct our attention to nonlinear effects on the particle current .",
    "the stationary current of a single particle performing a hopping motion in a nonsymmetric potential under an arbitrary bias is known exactly @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the stationary current of site - exclusion lattice gases in nonsymmetric potentials that lead to rectification effects in the single - particle case is a difficult problem .",
    "extensive work has been devoted to the asymmetric site exclusion process including the totally asymmetric site exclusion process ( tasep ) where the particles can only hop in one direction , corresponding to very strong bias .",
    "the case of uniform hopping potentials is now well understood @xcite , but the case of nonuniform potentials is not generally solved .",
    "recent work has been devoted to the tasep with disordered potentials @xcite . for the general asymmetric case one",
    "has to resort to numerical simulations ; we are going to present simulation results for the stationary current of lattice - gas particles in nonsymmetric potentials , for various concentrations and values of the bias .",
    "nonetheless , some analytical treatment can be given .",
    "first , the case of very small periodic systems can be treated explicitly : the motion of 2 particles on a ring of period 4 can be solved by elementary means . although this is a very simple system , conclusions can be drawn in the limit of very strong bias that are of interest for the totally asymmetric site exclusion process .",
    "the nonlinear current of site - exclusion lattice gases in extended systems with periodic repetitions of nonsymmetric segments can be derived in a mean - field approximation for strong bias conditions .",
    "interesting symmetry properties have been pointed out for the tasep in disordered hopping potentials @xcite . while a particle - vacancy symmetry is also present in our model , the case of inversion of the bias direction is different here .    in the following section the hopping motion of 2 particles on a ring of period 4 is solved and analyzed . in sec .",
    "iii a mean - field approximation for the stationary current of lattice gases under strong bias in nonsymmetric hopping potentials is presented and compared with simulation results in a sawtooth potential .",
    "the symmetry properties of the model are discussed in sec .",
    "iv and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "a very simple yet nontrivial model is given by a ring with 4 sites and 2 particles , cf .",
    "the basic quantities for the description of the system are the joint probabilities @xmath0 of finding one particle at site @xmath1 and the other particle at site @xmath2 , at time @xmath3 , for specified initial conditions . since the particles are considered as indistinguishable , @xmath4 .",
    "there are 6 different joint two - particle probabilities on the ring with 4 sites ( generally @xmath5 on rings with @xmath6 sites ) .",
    "higher - order joint probabilities do not occur for 2 particles .",

    "we are interested in the stationary solution of the system of master equations ( [ me ] ) . the stationary values @xmath13",
    "will be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the stationary joint probabilities for adjacent sites , e.g. @xmath15 , can all be expressed by the stationary joint probabilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , the first line of eq.([me ] ) yields @xmath18 three analogous relations follow from ( [ me ] ) ; they can be obtained by cyclically increasing the indices in eq.([elim ] ) .",
    "if the joint probabilities for adjacent sites are eliminated from the stationary master equations , two homogeneous equations remain which are equivalent .",
    "we write this equation as @xmath19 with the coefficients @xmath20    the second equation for @xmath16 and @xmath17 is obtained from the normalization condition eq.([np2 ] ) , after elimination of the joint probabilities of adjacent sites .",
    "it reads @xmath21 with the coefficients @xmath22 the solution of the two linear equations is @xmath23 since the joint probabilities for adjacent sites are obtained from the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the one - site stationary probabilities @xmath24 from eq.([pp ] ) , eq.([sol ] ) represents the complete solution of the stationary problem .",
    "we derive the stationary current in the system by considering the bond connecting sites 1 and 2 .",
    "the stationary current is given by @xmath25 the joint probabilities in eq.([curr1 ] ) ensure exclusion of double occupancy of sites . using eq.([pp ] ) the current is expressed in terms of the joint probabilities , @xmath26 insertion of the stationary solution for the joint probabilities gives @xmath27 the current may also be derived by considering the other bonds of the ring .",
    "two equivalent forms of the current result ; the second ( equivalent ) form reads @xmath28 it can be shown that the current vanishes if the right and left transition rates fulfill the following condition , @xmath29 corresponding to a detailed balance relation over the ring .",
    "the sawtooth potential including bias on a 4-site ring is defined by choosing @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the bias and @xmath32 is a constant representing a transition rate to the right in the absence of a bias , cf .",
    "fig.1(b ) . note that the right transition rates are explicitly multiplied by the bias factor @xmath31 and the left transition rates by @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "physically , @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the potential drop between two neighboring sites under the influence of the bias . for @xmath36",
    "the system satisfies the detailed balance condition and the current @xmath37 vanishes . in",
    "what follows the current obtained in a system with @xmath38 particles will be denoted as @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "[ figk2 ] we present a plot of @xmath40 and @xmath41 as functions of the bias @xmath31 for the ring with 4 sites and @xmath42 .",
    "the result for the two - particle system was obtained using eq .",
    "( [ curr4 ] ) , and for a single - particle system we employed the exact solution derived in ref .",
    "we can see that the behavior of the currents of one- and two - particle systems are qualitatively similar .",
    "of course , the current @xmath43 of two particles is larger than the one - particle current @xmath44 .",
    "the inset shows the behavior of the current for smaller bias .",
    "the curves for the bias to the right and to the left become equal in the limit @xmath45 , i.e. , in the linear - response regime , for two particles on the ring with 4 sites , and also for one particle on this ring .",
    "however , the two - particle current is about @xmath46 larger than the one - particle current .    in the case of a strong bias to the right , @xmath47",
    ", the two - particle current @xmath41 differs from @xmath40 by a constant factor . for the sawtooth potential this behavior",
    "can be understood as follows . if @xmath48 , only transitions to the right are important , and backward transitions can be neglected . in our model",
    "the transition rates to the right are all equal , @xmath49 for @xmath50 . hence for @xmath51 all stationary site occupation probabilities become equal , @xmath52 for the 4-site ring and @xmath53 for a ring with l sites . in the limit of a strong bias to the right all stationary joint probabilities also become equal , i.e. , @xmath54 @xmath55 for the 4-site ring and , generally , @xmath56 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using expression ( [ curr1 ] )",
    "we thus expect that for @xmath57 @xmath58.\\ ] ] for @xmath59 there is thus @xmath60 , which should be compared with the single - particle current @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , in the general case of an @xmath6-site ring we have @xmath62 for the 4-site ring this limiting behavior can be easily derived from the exact formula ( [ curr4 ] ) .",
    "actually , for @xmath59 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 there is @xmath65 , in agreement with the above considerations .",
    "figure  [ figk2 ] also shows that @xmath43 becomes almost identical to @xmath44 in the case of a strong bias to the left , @xmath66 . to understand this phenomenon",
    "assume that @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 , i.e. , site 1 acts as a `` bottle - neck '' .",
    "if @xmath66 the particles are driven against the high barrier at site 1 , which has a relatively very small transition rate @xmath69 to the left .",
    "the second particle on site 2 has to wait until the first particle has jumped over the high barrier , and only then can it make an attempt to jump over that barrier .",
    "soon after the first particle has managed to pass the bottleneck at site 1 , the second particle will jump from site 2 to 1 and the first particle will quickly line up behind the second particle , waiting for it to jump over the high barrier .",
    "consequently , the current becomes practically equal to that of a single - particle system .",
    "it is evident that in the limit of a large bias to the left the system behaves as a tasep on a ring with one defect .",
    "if the defect is characterized , in a discrete - time dynamics , by the transition probability @xmath70 , the current of @xmath38 particles on a ring with @xmath6 sites ( @xmath71 ) will approach the one - particle current .",
    "the above reasoning is confirmed by an explicit calculation of the current @xmath43 in the limit @xmath72 . using ( [ curr4 ] )",
    "we conclude , after some algebra , that @xmath73 .",
    "since for a single - particle system the current @xmath44 , for @xmath66 , is approximately equal @xmath74 ( see ref.@xcite ) , we find that @xmath75 for @xmath76 , i.e. , for a growing asymmetry of the sawtooth potential , this limit actually approaches 1 .",
    "in particular , for the value of @xmath42 used in fig .  2 there is @xmath77 .",
    "note , however , that in contrast to the case @xmath47 , for @xmath78 the current depends on the parameter @xmath79 characterizing the inhomogeneity of the sawtooth potential .",
    "in particular , for @xmath80 , which corresponds to a fully homogeneous system , @xmath81 .",
    "actually , for @xmath82 , the ratio @xmath83 equals @xmath84 irrespective of the bias @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this section lattice gases in extended potentials are considered that consist of periodic repetitions of nonsymmetric segments .",
    "first the situation of very strong bias is discussed and a mean - field approximation is given for the case where the particles experience periodically arranged high barriers .",
    "the analytical results are then compared with numerical simulations of the motion of lattice - gas particles in nonsymmetric hopping potentials for different concentrations and under various bias conditions .",
    "the hopping potential that is used in in this section is the sawtooth potential as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , except that it is periodically repeated with period @xmath6 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor transition rates from site @xmath85 to @xmath86 are @xmath87 . as a short notation we use @xmath88 for the `` right '' and @xmath89 for the `` left '' transition rates . without additional bias ,",
    "the transition rates between neighbor sites fulfill detailed balance .",
    "bias is introduced by multiplying all right transition rates by @xmath31 , @xmath90 , and all left transition rates by @xmath33 , @xmath91 .    the linear chain on which the model is defined shall have @xmath92 sites where we consider @xmath93 in this section .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are introduced and the sites are occupied by @xmath38 particles .",
    "the concentration is then @xmath94 .",
    "multiple occupancy of the sites is excluded ; no further interactions of the particles are taken into account .",
    "for @xmath57 we can apply essentially the same reasoning as in the case of the 2-particle system considered in sec .",
    "ii . in this limit transitions to the left",
    "are so rare that they can be ignored and the system essentially behaves like a tasep with transitions @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the current for such a system reads @xcite @xmath97 for large system sizes @xmath98 this formula can be rewritten as @xmath99      for @xmath78 we can neglect transition rates to the right , and so the system behaves like a tasep with transition rates @xmath100 if @xmath101 and @xmath102 otherwise .",
    "if additionally @xmath82 , all @xmath103 are equal to each other and the current is given simply by ( [ j_tasep ] ) .",
    "a more complicated situation appears for @xmath67 , a condition which will be assumed henceforth . in this case",
    "sites @xmath104 act on the flow of particles as `` bottlenecks '' , for the mean time necessary to leave them is much larger than the time to leave any other site .",
    "therefore the system , which consists of @xmath105 similar segments of length @xmath6 , effectively behaves like a ring made up of @xmath105 similar `` boxes '' , each able to contain up to @xmath6 particles .",
    "a transition from a segment @xmath2 to @xmath106 occurs with a rate @xmath107 irrespective of the number of particles in each of the segments , provided , of course , that there is at least one particle in segment @xmath2 and at most @xmath108 particles in segment @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath109 denote the probability that in the steady state there are @xmath110 particles in a given segment ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "let @xmath112 denote the joint probability of finding , in the steady state , @xmath113 particles at a given segment @xmath2 and @xmath114 particles at @xmath115 . of course @xmath109 and @xmath112 do not depend on @xmath2 , and the @xmath109 satisfy @xmath116",
    "let us assume a mean - field approximation : @xmath117",
    ". in the stationary state the mean number @xmath118 of segments occupied by @xmath110 particles does not depend on time .",
    "as the particles hop between segments , @xmath118 can decrease when one of the particles jumps from or to a segment occupied by @xmath110 particles .",
    "the corresponding rates are @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "the number of segments containing @xmath110 particles can also increase owing to jumps ending at segments containing @xmath121 particles or originating at segments with @xmath122 particles ; the corresponding transition rates are @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively . consequently , the appropriate balance conditions read @xmath125 where @xmath126 in ( [ balance1 ] ) and in ( [ balance2 ] ) and ( [ balance3 ] ) we have taken into account the fact that neither jumps from a segment containing @xmath127 particles nor transitions to a segment with @xmath6 particles are possible . together with ( [ prob=1 ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) these relations form @xmath128 equations for @xmath129 variables",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath111 , with the concentration @xmath130 being the only free parameter .",

    "the value @xmath136 corresponds to @xmath137 and , generally , @xmath138    having obtained @xmath109 we can calculate the current as @xmath139 using ( [ ro - a ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath140 because for @xmath141 eq .",
    "( [ conda ] ) implies @xmath142 , using our formula ( [ jbleft ] ) we conclude that for small concentrations of particles the current @xmath37 grows linearly with @xmath130 , @xmath143 for @xmath144 the mean - field theory ( [ jbleft ] ) predicts @xmath145      in our simulations we used a lattice with @xmath146 sites consisting of @xmath147 segments , each of length @xmath148 .",
    "we used a sawtooth potential with @xmath149 .",
    "the number of particles in the system varied from @xmath150 to @xmath151 .",
    "we carried out our simulations for @xmath152 monte carlo time steps per particle and the results were averaged over @xmath153 different realizations of the process , which enabled us to estimate the statistical errors .",
    "we first present simulation results for the current at a fixed concentration @xmath154 , or for @xmath155 , as a function of the bias parameter @xmath31 for bias to the right , and @xmath33 for bias to the left , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the current @xmath37 observed in simulations ( symbols ) together with a simple approximation obtained by multiplying a single - particle current @xmath40 @xcite by the number @xmath38 of particles in the system ( free particle approximation ) .",
    "one observes that the current in the case of a system with a hard - core interactions is reduced as compared to the case of non - interacting particles ; but the general behavior as a function of the bias parameter is practically the same . in particular , the rectification effects for particle motion in nonsymmetric potentials are qualitatively the same in both cases .",
    "the inset in fig.[fig3 ] depicts the ratio @xmath156 as a function of the bias . owing to ( [ j_tasep ] ) we expect that for @xmath57 @xmath157 .",
    "for @xmath158 we found @xmath159 , in excellent agreement with the theoretical value @xmath160 .",
    "for @xmath66 our mean - field approximation ( [ eq_34 ] ) predicts @xmath161 ; for @xmath162 our simulations yielded a slightly smaller value @xmath163 .",
    "we now discuss the dependence of the current on concentration for selected values of the bias @xmath164 , or @xmath165 , respectively , and compare the results with the theoretical considerations of sec .",
    "iiib . in fig .",
    "[ figright ] we present results of our simulations for a bias to the right ( @xmath166 , 10 and 2 ) . for a strong bias ( @xmath166 ) the agreement with the theoretical prediction , eq.([j_tasep_ro ] ) , is very good .",
    "the results obtained for a bias to the left ( @xmath167 , 0.1 , 0.5 , and 0.9 ) are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figleft ] .",
    "we can see that if the bias is strong ( @xmath168 ) , the agreement between the mean - field theory ( solid line ) and the simulation data ( circles and crosses ) is very good for concentrations close to 0 and 1 .",
    "however , for @xmath169 we observe that the mean - field theory tends to overestimate the actual value of @xmath37 by approximately 5% , which is much more than the statistical errors of our data ( the relative standard deviation at @xmath154 is about 0.33% ) .",
    "we repeated our simulations for larger number of monte - carlo time steps ( @xmath170 ) and for different values of the bias @xmath31 , but the difference between simulations and the theory remained practically the same . we thus conclude that it is not a numerical artifact .",
    "a similar discrepancy was observed by tripathy and barma @xcite , who considered a tasep with random transition rates .",
    "however , in their model the mean - field approach underestimated the magnitude of the current obtained in simulations for @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , they found that @xmath172 has quite a broad plateau around @xmath173 .",
    "this phenomenon is not observed in our case because the transition rates in our model are not random .",
    "in this section we discuss the symmetry properties of our lattice - gas model with nonsymmetric potentials , and of related models . in the simulations , as well as in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the current exhibits a particle - vacancy symmetry , @xmath174 the symmetry properties of the tasep have been analyzed in @xcite and the relation eq.([sym ] ) has been established in this context .",
    "however , the model employed in those references differs in important aspects from our model .",
    "hence a detailed discussion is in order .",
    "the particle - vacancy symmetry of the current for the tasep has been shown in refs.@xcite for disordered hopping potentials where the transition rates are associated with the bonds between the sites . if the motion of the particles is reversed ( symmetry operation t according to refs.@xcite , the particles experience the same set of transition rates as before , only the order of the rates has been changed .",
    "if the vacancies are interpreted as particles ( symmetry operation c ) , they experience the same transition rates as the particles after the operation t. the symmetry under ct is evident ; the nontrivial statement is the symmetry of the current ( up to a sign ) under the operations c , or t , separately .    the class of models for the hopping potential that are considered here do not correspond to bond disorder .",
    "the set of `` right '' transition rates is different from the set of the `` left '' transition rates .",
    "if a strong bias @xmath175 to the right is applied , leading approximately to a tasep , the current is different from the case of strong bias to the left with @xmath176 . in other words ,",
    "the symmetry under reversal of motion t does not exist for the class of models leading to rectification , by their definition .",
    "if the vacancies are considered as particles , they experience the same set of transition rates as the original particles , see also below .",
    "we conjecture that symmetry under the operation c also exists for our models , if the limiting case of the tasep is considered .",
    "hence we expect eq.([sym ] ) to be approximately valid for the models that lead to rectification effects , in the limit of very strong bias .",
    "the sawtooth potential that is investigated in this paper has a special symmetry which will be described now . in the limit of concentration of the lattice gas",
    "approaching one , the particle problem is equivalent to the problem of hopping motion of single , independent vacancies .",
    "the hopping transitions of an isolated vacancy are reversed in comparison to the transitions of the particle that makes an exchange with the vacancy , e.g. , @xmath177    using the rates eq.([gv ] ) it is easy to reconstruct the hopping potential for single vacancies .",
    "if this construction is done for the the extended sawtooth potential of fig.1(b ) , a sawtooth potential is obtained for the vacancy which is mirror - symmetric with respect to the original sawtooth potential , see fig .",
    "if a bias is applied to the particles , expressed by the factor @xmath31 in the transition rates to the right , the factor @xmath31 appears in the transition rates of the vacancy to the left .",
    "it is evident from this consideration that the particle current for @xmath178 is identical to the one for @xmath179 .",
    "it is obvious that a particle - vacancy symmetry pertains for the problem of motion of lattice gases in a sawtooth potential with the above symmetry property ; hence we expect eq.([sym ] ) to be valid for all values of the bias @xmath31 .",
    "we point out that the sawtooth potential represents a special case ; general nonsymmetric potentials do not provide mirror - symmetric potentials for the vacancies in the limit @xmath179 .",
    "for instance , if the potential corresponding to an ehrlich - schwoebel barrier ( see , eg .",
    "@xcite ) is transformed by using eq.([gv ] ) into the corresponding hopping potential of a single vacancy , a different potential is obtained . as a consequence ,",
    "the mobility of a single particle is different from the mobility of a single vacancy .",
    "hence for this example @xmath180 for @xmath31 close to @xmath181 .",
    "this example is sufficient to show that the particle - vacancy symmetry ( [ sym ] ) can not be generally valid , for arbitrary @xmath31 .",
    "another counterexample is provided by the random - trap model , see ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we investigated the motion of lattice - gas particles in hopping potentials that are composed of segments without mirror - reflection symmetry .",
    "we considered in particular the effects of exclusion of multiple occupancy of sites , under various bias conditions .",
    "we first studied the case of two particles on a ring of 4 sites with a sawtooth potential .",
    "the explicit solution of this simple system can be given , and interesting conclusions emerge in the limits of large bias to the right , or to the left .",
    "we point out that the ring with 4 sites is a model case for the treatment of 2 site - exclusion particles on a finite ring ; larger systems can be solved in a similar manner , e.g. , by using symbolic formula manipulation programs .",
    "we then investigated the case of many particles on extended systems which consist of periodic repetitions of sawtooth potentials .",
    "these systems behave , for strong bias in one direction , as uniform systems where the result for the current of lattice gases is known . for strong bias in the reverse directions ,",
    "the extended sawtooth potential acts as a periodic arrangement of weak links .",
    "a mean - field expression for the current can be derived for this case from the cluster dynamics of the particles on the segments , which shows similarities to the cluster dynamics of the bosonic lattice gases of ref.@xcite .",
    "good agreement with the numerical simulations was found for both cases under strong bias ; deviations appear for smaller bias values .",
    "the results for the current exhibit a particle - vacancy symmetry as a consequence of a special particle - hole symmetry of the hopping processes in the sawtooth potential used .    generally , the current per particle of a site - exclusion lattice gas shows the same qualitative behavior as a function of the strength and the direction of the bias parameter , as the current of independent particles .",
    "this observation is important for possible applications , for instance for transport through channels in membranes or through layered structures with suitable potential structures .",
    "it means that qualitative or even semiquantitative predictions of the effects of strong bias on the current can already be obtained from the single - particle description .",

    "<S> the hopping motion of lattice gases through potentials without mirror - reflection symmetry is investigated under various bias conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the model of 2 particles on a ring with 4 sites is solved explicitly ; the resulting current in a sawtooth potential is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the current of lattice gases in extended systems consisting of periodic repetitions of segments with sawtooth potentials is studied for different concentrations and values of the bias . </S>",
    "<S> rectification effects are observed , similar to the single - particle case . </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field approximation for the current in the case of strong bias acting against the highest barriers in the system is made and compared with numerical simulations . </S>",
