    "h ii system exhibits bistability between different stationary solutions where in one case , preys exceed their carrying capacity @xmath153 and the predator populations are negative @xmath154 , and in the other case , the prey populations are negative @xmath155 and predators assume a small positive value .",
    "it is important to note yet again that these solutions are impractical because the populations can not exist above their carrying capacities nor can they take negative values under realistic modeling constraints . for h iii system ,",
    "we only observe the equilibrium solutions with @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( see inset ) . in both the cases",
    ", we have a non vanishing @xmath158 and therefore these solutions exist due to augmentation and can not be observed otherwise . following this analysis",
    ", we can conclude that augmenting the prey is the correct strategy to stabilize of the origin and the other coupling schemes can lead to complicated dynamics .",
    "even though the analysis here is limited to the origin , we can expect these behaviors to be quite general with respect to other stationary solutions as well .",
    "now considering applications , as already mentioned , origin corresponds to an equilibrium for which the predators and the preys vanish .",

    "for the simple models considered in the previous analysis , it is clear that either by coupling the system appropriately or by using specific parameter values for @xmath12 and @xmath20 , we can avoid stabilizing the origin .",

    "therefore by using appropriate values of @xmath20 and @xmath12 , we can keep the system in either a periodic state , or a stationary state with non vanishing populations and can expect this procedure to work in experiments and be robust with respect to noise ; ref .",

    "in this work we studied the general ability of linear augmentation towards stabilizing desired stationary solutions of oscillatory systems . through some simple examples discussed in this paper ,",
    "it is clear that the effectiveness of this scheme is quite sensitive to the augmentation parameters , the class of oscillatory systems considered , the stationary solutions to stabilize and also on the way the systems are augmented .",
    "therefore , although the simplicity of linear augmentation makes it a very compelling choice for applications , a careful analysis is required to test the system for potential pitfalls associated with the scheme .",
    "as highlighted by the examples , apart from failing to target the appropriate stationary solutions , linear augmentation can also lead to other complicated dynamical situations which include escaping trajectories , stabilization of unintended stationary solutions or the stabilization of stationary solutions which are not permitted under the modeling constraints ; preys existing above their carrying capacities and negative predator populations in sec .",
