    "the presence of strong x - ray and nonthermal radio emission in late - type stars is a well - known indication of enhanced coronal activity ( drake et al .",
    "1992 ; gdel 2002 ) .",
    "x - ray emission from coronae ( @xmath9k ) and chromospheric emission ( @xmath10k ) are also closely correlated , and thus stars with intense coronae will have strong chromospheric emission , as evidenced by their uv and ca ii h and k line emission ( e.g. ayres et al .",
    "1995 ) . while many active stars have been identified as such through their x - ray and radio emission , it is only through detailed optical photometric and spectroscopic studies that their activity can be classified into known types .",
    "rs cvn binaries are perhaps the most common type of active star , at least for stars having spectral types in the range from late f through k. in an rs cvn binary , the two stars are usually tidally locked so that the rotational period of each star is approximately the same as the orbital period ; however , the two stars are not undergoing mass transfer ( i.e. they form a detached system ) .",
    "one star is generally a spectral type f to g dwarf or a subgiant that is @xmath11 1000 k hotter than its companion , which is usually a g to k type giant or sub - giant . in the more recent definition of the rs cvn class ,",
    "there is no restriction on the spectral type of the secondary star or on the orbital period , except for the evolutionary constraint ( fekel et al .",
    "rs cvns have been further subdivided into three groups according to their orbital period : the short period ( @xmath12 d ) , classical ( @xmath13 d ) , and long period ( @xmath14 d ) groups . in the soft ( 0.1 - 2.0 kev )",
    "x - ray band , the luminosities of rs cvn binaries typically lie in the range of @xmath15 erg s@xmath16 ( drake et al .",
    "1989 ) , compared to @xmath17 erg s@xmath16 for normal late - type stars ( schmitt & liefke 2004 ) .",
    "vla and atca observations at cm wavelengths have shown that the radio luminosities of rs cvn systems are in the range from @xmath18 to @xmath19 erg s@xmath16 hz@xmath16 ( drake & linsky 1986 , drake et al.1989 ) , which is also enhanced compared to that found for other late - type stars , typically @xmath20 erg s@xmath16 hz@xmath16 ( gdel 2002 ) .    the k0 iv star hd 81032 ( houk & smith - moore 1988 ) was first noticed as an x - ray active star when it was identified as the likely optical counterpart of a soft x - ray ( 0.2 - 4.0 kev ) source in the einstein slew survey , 1es 0920 - 13.6 , with an x - ray flux of @xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath16 ( elvis et al .",

    "this star was detected on february 12 , 1993 as a radio source , with a 3.6 cm flux of @xmath24 mjy ( drake , s. a. , private communication ) .",
    "given its spectral type and luminosity class , and its v - magnitude of 8.91 ( wright et al .",
    "2003 ) , the spectroscopic distance of hd 81032 is @xmath25 pc , implying an x - ray luminosity of @xmath26 erg s@xmath16 ( based on the rass count rate and an assumed conversion factor of @xmath27 erg @xmath22 pspc cts@xmath16 : a self - consistent x - ray luminosity based on the rass data is calculated in  8) , and a radio luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath16 hz@xmath16 , where the distance uncertainty is the dominant contributor to the large errors in the luminosities .",
    "these values clearly show that the star hd 81032 has an active corona .    in this paper",
    ", we present extensive optical photometric and spectroscopic observations , as well as an analysis of archival x - ray data , of the star hd 81032 .",

    "differential photometry , in the sense of variable minus the comparison star , was done , since program , comparison and check stars were all in the same ccd frame .",

    "the data were acquired with a @xmath33 ccd camera of @xmath34 square pixel size covering a range of @xmath35 and having a dispersion of @xmath36 .",
    "the star was observed in the wavelength ranges of 3500 - 4700   and 5700 - 6900  .",
    "four spectra of hd 81032 in the h@xmath2 region and three in the caii h and k region were obtained .",
    "a signal - to - noise of ratio between 20 to 40 was achieved in these spectra .",
    "hd 71952 , a k0iv type star , was also observed as a reference star for hd 81032 .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the standard reduction procedures in the iraf packages ( bias subtraction , flat fielding , extraction of the spectrum and wavelength calibration using arc lamps ) .",
    "the spectral resolution was determined by using emission lines of arc lamps taken on the same nights .",
    "a spectral resolution ( @xmath37 ) of @xmath38 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 at @xmath41 was achieved .",
    "all the spectra were normalized to the continuum and equivalent widths for the emission lines were computed using the iraf task _",
    "splot_. the errors in the measurement of the equivalent widths of the emission lines were determined by measuring the equivalent widths of some moderate absorption lines for each spectra .",
    "we computed the standard deviation for the equivalent width of each feature , and finally determined the mean standard deviation to be @xmath42 .",
    "the star hd 81032 was observed and detected by the rosat pspc detector during the rosat all - sky - survey ( rass ) phase over a 2-day period from 1990 november 10 to 12 .",
    "the exposure time was 501 s , and was accumulated in 26 separate short scans of this region of sky .",
    "the pspc had an energy range from 0.1 - 2.4 kev with a ( low ) spectral resolution ( @xmath43 at 1 kev ) .",
    "a full description of the x - ray telescope and detectors can be found in trmper ( 1983 ) and in pfeffermann et al.(1987 ) .",
    "the rosat x - ray data for hd 81032 were obtained from the public archives , the relevant rass dataset being rs932025n00 .",
    "source spectra for hd 81032 were accumulated from on - source counts obtained from a circular region on the sky centered on the x - ray peak and having a radius of 3.85 arcmin .",

    "photometric light curves corresponding to the four observing runs were taken .",
    "figure [ ligper.fig ] shows the v band differential light curves of the star hd 81032 at different epochs .",

    "the yearly mean of the standard deviation(@xmath44 ) between the different measures of comparison and check stars in the b , v and r filters was found to be 0.011 , 0.01 and 0.01 , respectively . each light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ ligper.fig ] was analysed for periodicity . to find a period from unequally spaced data",
    ", we used the clean algorithm ( roberts et al .",

    "the cleaned power spectra presented were obtained after 100 iterations with a loop gain of 0.1 .",
    "the period is found to be constant within error for each epoch . to improve the period determination of the star hd 81032 ,",
    "the entire data from 2000 - 2004 were analysed using the same algorithm .",
    "figure [ power.fig ] shows the cleaned power spectrum from the entire dataset .",
    "the highest peak in the cleaned power spectrum corresponds to a period of @xmath45 .",
    "the 18.802 d period is much more plausible than the 57 d period reported earlier ( pandey et al .",
    "the previous determination was mainly due to observational limitations as our early data were too sparse and highly uneven . besides a subgiant like this one is unlikely to be synchronized in a binary of 57-days period .",
    "the julian days of the observations were converted to the phases using the ephemeris :    @xmath46    where the initial epoch corresponds to the conjunction with the first minimum observed .",
    "figure [ fold.fig ] shows the differential b , v , r and v@xmath47 , light curves and , ( b - v ) and ( v - r ) colour curves of the star hd 81032 . here",
    "v@xmath47 stands for the differential v band light curve of the comparison and the check stars .",
    "each point in the light curves is mean of 3 - 4 independent observations taken over a night .",
    "the light curve during the observing years 2001 - 2002 has a dense temporal coverage .",
    "we , therefore , divided this light curve into two different epochs to see any variation in the @xmath48 and the amplitude .",
    "the mean epoch of the light curves , the observed maximum ( @xmath49 ) and minimum ( @xmath50 ) in the v band , peak to peak amplitude ( @xmath51 ) , and phase of minima(@xmath48 ) are listed in table [ ligper.tab ] .",
    "the value of @xmath49 was constant during each epoch indicating that the brightness of unspotted photosphere was constant from epoch to epoch .",
    "however , the value of @xmath50 was reduced by 0.14 mag from epoch a to epoch b , and remained constant during the epoch c , d and e.    the rs cvn systems usually show one or two well defined minima , thereby indicating that the rotational modulations caused by one or two prominent spots or groups of spots .",
    "additional spots may be present at other longitudes , or in the circumpolar regions but contribution to the overall rotational modulation may not be appreciable .",
    "the phase of the light minimum ( @xmath48 ) directly indicates the mean longitude of the dominant groups of spots .",
    "a sharp minimum was observed during the epoch a ( see fig . [ fold.fig]a ) . at the same time",
    "the amplitude of the v band light curve was found to be 0.288 mag , which was maximum during our observations .",
    "the sharpness of the minimum indicate that it is the latitudinal extent of the groups of spots that may be responsible rather than the longitudinal extent .",
    "broad minima during the epochs b , c and d indicate that the spots were spread over an appreciable longitudinal range ( fig .",
    "[ fold.fig ] b to d ) .",
    "it is interesting to see the light curve of the star hd 81032 during the epoch e. here a single large spot , characterized by a broad minimum during the epochs b , c and d separated into two groups of spots .",
    "this can be easily seen by two well separated minima ( see fig .",
    "[ fold.fig ] e ) .",
    "significant change in @xmath48 ( see table [ ligper.tab ] ) is probably associated with a change in the spot configuration on the surface of the star .",
    "variation in the colour of the star hd 81032 is correlated with its magnitude ( see top two panels of fig .",
    "[ fold.fig ] a to e ) i.e. the star becomes redder when fainter , and bluer when brighter , supporting the starspot hypothesis .",
    "the significance of the correlation has been calculated by determining the linear correlation coefficient , r , between the magnitude and the colours .",
    "the value of r between v and ( b - v ) , v and ( v - r ) and ( b - v ) and ( v - r ) was found to be 0.20 , 0.55 and 0.40 , with the corresponding probability of no correlation being 0.0253 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the conventional starspot model assumes that the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere , and hence one would expect the star to be the reddest at the light minimum , although flaring activity can lead an opposite effect being observed as seen in ux ari ( ulvs & henry 2003 ; padmakar & pandey 1999 ; ravindran & mohin 1995 ) .",
    "figure [ phmin.fig ] shows the plot of the mean epoch versus phase minima ( @xmath48 ) of the v band light curves .",
    "the following equation was fitted to the data by the method of linear least squares to determine the rate of the phase shift ( or migration period ) .",
    "@xmath54    here @xmath55 is the rate of phase shift ( degrees / day ) , p is the corresponding period in days , t is time in days , @xmath56 is reference time , and @xmath57 is the reference spot longitude in degree .",
    "after the epoch jd 2452400 ( or after the epoch d ) , the evolution of different spots seems to be more responsible than the migration of single group of spots , so , we have used only first three points of the fig .",
    "[ phmin.fig ] ( i.e. the phase minima of epoch a , b and c ) in the linear least square fit of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ phmin.fig ] shows the linear least square fit of the equation ( 1 ) to the data .",
    "the rate of phase shift for the group of spots was determined as @xmath58 degree / day , which corresponds to a migration period of @xmath1 years .",
    "the smaller group of spots during the epoch e appears to rotate with the similar angular velocity with that of a group of spots during the epoch a , b and c ( see the dotted line in fig . [ phmin.fig ] ) .",
    "however , long - term studies of spot groups evolution and migration in the star hd 81032 require much more frequent sampling in the time domain .",
    "the arrangement of groups of spots in one permanent strip can be easily interpreted as a long lived active group rotating with the same velocity .",
    "the open circles in the fig .",
    "[ phmin.fig ] are not following that strip , and may be due to the formation of a new group of spots on the surface of the star .",
    "the h@xmath2 and caii h & k emission lines are important indicators of chromospheric activity . in very active stars like",
    "ii peg , v711 tau , ux ari the h@xmath2 emission is seen clearly above the continuum , whereas in less active stars only a filled in absorption line is observed .",

    "[ halpha.fig ] ) .",
    "it has been suggested that in the rs cvn systems at least one star must also show the intense emission in the  h and  k lines of caii ( fekel et al .",
    "as shown in figure [ caiihk.fig ] , caii h and k lines are above the continuum at all the phases observed .",
    "the measured equivalent widths ( ews ) of the h@xmath2 , caii h and k emission feature , the corresponding jd and phase are listed in table [ ew.tab ] .",
    "the photometric observations during the epoch d were close to the spectroscopic observations .",
    "figure [ splc.fig ] shows the plot of ews of ca ii  h ,  k and h@xmath2 against phase , along with the v band light curve of the epoch d. it appears that h@xmath2 , ca ii h , and k emission features are variable and anti - correlated with the photometric phase i.e. the maximum at photometric minimum and minimum at photometric maximum .",
    "this could be due to the presence of active cool spots on the surface of the star .",
    "the value of the total galactic reddening e(b - v ) in the direction of hd 81032 is estimated to be 0.04 mag from the reddening map given by schlegel et al .",
    "however , the star hd 81032 suffers negligible reddening at a distance of 140 pc , and we assume e(b - v ) = 0 for the remaining discussion . using the tycho parallax ( hog 1997 ) and the value of @xmath59 mag from the present photometry",

    "<S> bvr photometric and quasi - simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations of the star hd 81032 have been carried out during the years 2000 - 2004 . </S>",

    "<S> a large group of spots with a migration period of @xmath1 years is inferred from the first three years of the data . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath2 and ca ii h and k emissions from the star indicate high chromospheric activity . the available photometry in the bvrijhk bands is consistent with spectral type of k0 iv previously found for this star . </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the spectral energy distribution of hd 81032 for the presence of an infrared colour excess using the 2mass jhk and iras photometry , but found no significant excess in any band above the normal values expected for a star with this spectral type . </S>",
    "<S> we have also analyzed the x - ray emission properties of this star using data obtained by the rosat x - ray observatory during its all - sky survey phase . </S>",
    "<S> an x - ray flare of about 12 hours duration was detected during the two days of x - ray coverage obtained for this star . </S>",
    "<S> its x - ray spectrum , while only containing 345 counts , is inconsistent with a single - temperature component solar - abundance coronal plasma model , but implies either the presence of two or more plasma components , non - solar abundances , or a combination of both of these properties . </S>",
