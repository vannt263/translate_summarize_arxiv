    "one of the most puzzling and persistent since a long time spin effect was observed in inclusive hyperon production in collisions of unpolarized hadron beams .",
    "a very significant polarization of @xmath0hyperons has been discovered two decades ago @xcite . since then measurements in different processes",
    "were performed @xcite and number of models was proposed for qualitative and quantitative description of these data @xcite . among them the lund model based on classical string mechanism of strange quark pair production @xcite , models based on spin ",
    "orbital interaction @xcite and multiple scattering of massive strange sea quarks in effective external field @xcite and also models for polarization of @xmath0 in diffractive processes with account for proton states with additional @xmath1 pairs such as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it was proposed also to connect @xmath0 polarization in the process @xmath3 with the polarization in the process @xmath4 @xcite and use triple regge approach @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of gluon fusion in perturbative qcd as a source of strange quark polarization has been considered in @xcite and @xmath5 and @xmath6dependencies of @xmath0polarization has been discussed .",
    "nevertheless , hyperon polarization phenomena are not completely understood in qcd and currently could be considered even as a more serious problem than the problem of proton spin which hopefully will find its final resolution in near future .",
    "of course , those problems are interrelated and one could attempt to connect the spin structure of nucleons studied in deep ",
    "inelastic scattering with the polarization of @xmath0 s observed in hadron production . as it is widely known now ,",
    "only part ( less than one third in fact ) of the proton spin is due to quark spins @xcite .",
    "these results can be interpreted in the effective qcd approach ascribing a substantial part of hadron spin to an orbital angular momentum of quark matter .",
    "it is natural to guess that this orbital angular momentum might be revealed in asymmetries in hadron production .",
    "it is also evident from deep ",
    "inelastic scattering data @xcite that strange quarks play essential role in the proton structure and in its spin balance in particular .",
    "they are negatively polarized in a polarized nucleon , @xmath7 .",
    "polarization effects in hyperon production also continue to demonstrate @xcite that strange quarks produced in hadron interactions appear to be polarized .    in the recent papers @xcite we considered a possible origin of asymmetry in the pion and @xmath8meson production under collision of a polarized proton beam with unpolarized proton target and argued that the orbital angular momentum of partons inside constituent quarks leads to significant asymmetries in meson production . in this paper we consider how",
    "the most characteristic features of hyperon and first of all @xmath0 polarization can be accounted in such approach .",
    "we consider a nonperturbative hadron as consisting of the constituent quarks located at the central part of the hadron which embedded into a quark condensate .",
    "experimental and theoretical arguments in favor of such a picture were given , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we refer to effective qcd and the use the njl model @xcite as a basis .",
    "the lagrangian in addition to the four  fermion interaction of the original njl model includes the six ",
    "fermion @xmath9breaking term .",
    "transition to partonic picture in this model is described by the introduction of a momentum cutoff @xmath10 gev , which corresponds to the scale of chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking .",
    "we adopt the point that the need for such cutoff is an effective implementation of the short distance behaviour in qcd @xcite .",
    "the constituent quark masses can be expressed in terms of quark condensates @xcite , e.g. : @xmath11 in this approach massive quarks appear as quasiparticles , i.e. as current quarks and the surrounding clouds of quark  antiquark pairs which consist of a mixture of quarks of the different flavors .",
    "it is worth to stress that in addition to @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks constituent quark ( @xmath14 , for example ) contains pairs of strange quarks ( cf .",
    "( [ ms ] ) ) .",
    "quantum numbers of the constituent quarks are the same as the quantum numbers of current quarks due to the conservation of the corresponding currents in qcd .",
    "the only exception is the flavor ",
    "singlet , axial  vector current , it has a @xmath15dependence due to axial anomaly which arises under quantization .",
    "quark radii are determined by the radii of the clouds surrounding it .",
    "we assume that the strong interaction radius of quark @xmath16 is determined by its compton wavelength : @xmath17 , where constant @xmath18 is universal for different flavors .",
    "quark formfactor @xmath19 is taken in the dipole form , viz @xmath20 and the corresponding quark matter distribution @xmath21 is of the form @xcite : @xmath22    spin of constituent quark @xmath23 in this approach is given by the following sum @xmath24 the value of the orbital momentum contribution into the spin of constituent quark can be estimated with account for new experimental results from deep ",
    "inelastic scattering @xcite indicating that quarks carry even less than one third of proton spin , i.e. @xmath25 and taking into account the relation between contributions of current quarks into a proton spin and corresponding contributions of current quarks into a spin of constituent quarks and that of constituent quarks into proton spin @xcite : @xmath26 if we adopt that @xmath27 by 25@xmath28 @xcite . ]",
    "then we should conclude that @xmath29 and from eq .",
    "( [ bal ] ) @xmath30 , i. e. about 80% of the @xmath14 or @xmath31-quark spin is due to the orbital angular momenta of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath32 quarks inside the constituent quark while the spin of current valence quark is screened by the spins of the quark  antiquark pairs .",
    "it is also important to note the exact compensation between the spins quark ",
    "antiquark pairs and their angular orbital momenta : @xmath33 since we consider effective lagrangian approach where gluon degrees of freedom are overintegrated , we do not discuss problems of the principal separation and mixing of the quark orbital angular momentum and gluon effects in qcd ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the njl  model @xcite the six - quark fermion operator simulates the effect of gluon operator @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the gluon field tensor in qcd",
    ". the only effective degrees of freedom here are quasiparticles ; mesons and baryons are the bound states arising due to residual interactions between the quasiparticles .",
    "account for axial anomaly in the framework of chiral quark models results in compensation of the valence quark helicity by helicities of quarks from the cloud in the structure of constituent quark .",
    "the specific nonperturbative mechanism of such compensation is different in different approaches @xcite , e.g. the modification of the axial u(1 ) charge of constituent quark is considered to be generated by the interaction of current quarks with flavor singlet field @xmath36 .",
    "the apparent physical mechanism of such compensation has been discussed recently in @xcite .    on these grounds",
    "we can conclude that significant part of the spin of constituent quark should be associated with the orbital angular momentum of quarks inside this constituent quark , i.e. the cloud quarks should rotate coherently inside constituent quark .    the important point what the origin of this orbital angular momentum is .",
    "it was proposed @xcite to use an analogy with an anisotropic extension of the theory of superconductivity which seems to match well with the above picture for a constituent quark .",
    "the studies @xcite of that theory show that the presence of anisotropy leads to axial symmetry of pairing correlations around the anisotropy direction @xmath37 and to the particle currents induced by the pairing correlations .",
    "in another words it means that a particle of the condensed fluid is surrounded by a cloud of correlated particles ( `` hump '' ) which rotate around it with the axis of rotation @xmath38 .",
    "( [ bal ] ) calculation of the orbital momentum shows that it is proportional to the density of the correlated particles .",
    "thus , it is clear that there is a direct analogy between this picture and that describing the constituent quark .",
    "an axis of anisotropy @xmath38 can be associated with the polarization vector of valence quark located at the origin of the constituent quark .",
    "the orbital angular momentum @xmath39 lies along @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "( [ bal ] ) .",
    "we argued that the existence of this orbital angular momentum , i.e. orbital motion of quark matter inside constituent quark , is the origin of the observed asymmetries in inclusive production at moderate and high transverse momenta .",
    "indeed , since the constituent quark has a small size @xmath40 the asymmetry associated with internal structure of this quark will be significant at @xmath41 gev / c where interactions at short distances give noticeable contribution .",
    "the behaviour of asymmetries in inclusive meson production was predicted @xcite to have a corresponding @xmath42dependence , in particular , vanishing asymmetry at @xmath43 , its increase in the region of @xmath44 , and @xmath42independent asymmetry at @xmath45 .",
    "parameter @xmath46 gev / c is determined by the scale of chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking .",
    "such a behaviour of asymmetry follows from the fact that the constituent quarks themselves have slow ( if at all ) orbital motion and are in the @xmath47state , but interactions with @xmath45 resolve the internal structure of constituent quark and `` feel '' the presence of internal orbital momenta inside this constituent quark .",
    "it should be noted that at high @xmath6 we will see the constituent quark being a cluster of partons which however should preserve their orbital momenta , i.e. the orbital angular momentum will be retained and the partons in the cluster are to be correlated .",
    "it should be stressed again that a nonzero internal orbital momentum of partons in the constituent quark means that there are significant multiparton correlations .",
    "presence of such parton correlations is in agreement with a high locality of strange sea in the nucleon .",
    "the concept of locality was proposed in @xcite on the basis of analysis of the recent ccfr data @xcite for neutrino deep ",
    "inelastic scattering .",
    "the locality serves as a measure of the local proximity of strange quark and antiquark in momentum and coordinate spaces .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the ccfr data indicate that the strange quark and antiquark have very similar distributions in momentum and coordinate spaces .",
    "we consider the hadron process of the type @xmath48 with unpolarized beam and target .",
    "usually we consider @xmath49 and @xmath50 being protons and @xmath51  @xmath0hyperon .",
    "its polarization is being measured through angular distribution of products in parity nonconserving @xmath0 decay .",
    "the picture of hadron consisting of constituent quarks embedded into quark condensate implies that overlapping and interaction of peripheral clouds occur at the first stage of hadron interaction . under this",
    ", condensate is being excited and as a result the quasiparticles , i. e. massive quarks appear in the overlapping region . it should be noted that the condensate excitations are massive quarks , since the vacuum is nonperturbative one and there is no overlap between the physical ( nonperturbative ) and bare ( perturbative ) vacuum @xcite .",
    "the part of hadron energy carried by the outer clouds of condensates being released in the overlapping region , goes to the generation of massive quarks .",
    "number of such quarks fluctuates .",
    "the average number of these quarks in the framework of the geometrical picture can be estimated as follows : @xmath52 sign @xmath53 denotes convolution integral @xmath54 the function @xmath55 describes condensate distribution inside hadron @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the impact parameter of colliding hadrons @xmath49 and @xmath50 . to estimate the function @xmath58 we can use the maximal possible value @xmath59 @xcite",
    "thus , as a result massive virtual quarks appear in the overlapping region and some mean field is generated .",
    "constituent quarks located in the central part of hadron are supposed to scatter in a quasi - independent way by this mean field .",
    "we propose the following mechanism for polarization of @xmath0hyperons based on the above picture for hadron structure .",
    "inclusive production of the hyperon @xmath51 results from two mechanisms : recombination of the constituent quarks with virtual massive strange quark ( low @xmath42 s , soft interactions ) into @xmath51 hyperon or from the scattering of a constituent quark in the mean field , excitation of this constituent quark , appearence of a strange quark as a result of decay of the constituent quark and subsequent fragmentation of strange quark in the hyperon @xmath51 .",
    "the second mechanism is determined by the interactions at distances smaller than constituent quark radius and is associated therefore with hard interactions ( high @xmath42 s ) .",
    "this second mechanism could result from the single scattering in the mean field , excitation and decay of constituent quark or from the multiple scattering in this field with subsequent corresponding excitation and decay of the constituent quark .",
    "it is due to the multiple scattering by mean field the parent constituent quark becomes polarized since it has a nonzero mass @xcite and this polarization results in polarization of produced strange quarks and appearance of the corresponding angular orbital momentum .",
    "other mentioned mechanisms lead to production of unpolarized @xmath0hyperons .",
    "thus , we adopt a two  component picture of hadron production which incorporates interactions at long and short distances and it is the short distance dynamics which determines the production of polarized @xmath0hyperon .    it is necessary to note here , that after decay of the parent constituent quark , current quarks appear in the nonperturbative vacuum and become a quasiparticles due to the nonperturbative dressing with a cloud of @xmath60-pairs .",
    "mechanism of this process could be associated with the strong coupling existing in the pseudoscalar channel @xcite .",
    "now we write down the explicit formulas for corresponding inclusive cross  sections and polarization of hyperon @xmath51 .",
    "the following expressions were obtained in @xcite which take into account unitarity in the direct channel of reaction .",
    "they have the form @xmath61 where @xmath57 is the impact parameter of colliding hadrons . here",
    "function @xmath62 is the generalized reaction matrix ( helicity nonflip one ) which is determined by dynamics of the elastic reaction @xmath63 arrows here denote the corresponding transverse polarization of hyperon @xmath51 .",

    "as it has been already noted we consider the most simple case of @xmath0hyperon production . in this case spin and polarization of hyperon @xmath51 is completely determined by the spin and polarization of @xmath32-quark from the internal structure of parent constituent quark .",
    "the latter acquires its polarization due to multiple scattering in the mean field .",
    "this polarization is negative , e.g. in gluon external field it is @xcite @xmath117 it could have significant value since constituent quark in our case has a nonzero mass @xmath118 and intensity of the mean field in the model @xmath119 since it is generated by the quasiparticles whose average number is rising with energy like @xmath120 @xcite . note that @xmath121 in eq .",

    "thus on the basis of above considerations we take an assumption that the polarization of constituent quark is energy independent and it is approaching the maximal value @xmath122 at @xmath123 . the assumption about maximality of polarization at the constituent level has been made on the basis of recent data of aleph collaboration @xcite which made such indication in the analysis of @xmath124 polarization in @xmath125 interaction .",

    "we obtain a good agreement with the data in the case of linear dependence of constituent quark polarization .",

    "qualitative @xmath6 dependence of polarization described above also is in good agreement with corresponding experimental data . to describe quantitevely the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath0polarization , in particular , in the region @xmath143 we should chose an explicit parameterization of the cross ",

    "it is proportional to the orbital angular momentum of strange quarks initially confined in the constituent quark ; * sign of polarization and its value are proportional to polarization of the constituent quark gained due to the multiple scattering in the mean field .",

    "the observed @xmath42dependence of @xmath0hyperon polarization in inclusive processes seems to confirm such conclusions , since it appears to show up beyond @xmath151 gev / c , i.e. the scale where internal structure of constituent quark can be probed .",
    "note , that short  distance interaction in this approach observes coherent rotation of correlated @xmath60pairs inside the constituent quark and not a gas of free partons .",
    "we have considered the most simple case of @xmath0hyperon polarization . as a whole problem , the case of hyperon polarization is extremely complicated and many reactions we did not attempt to account and many questions are left unanswered .",
    "however , few comments on the other reactions and the underlying mechanism we could make .",
    "first , we would like to note that experimental data show that proton polarization in inclusive process @xmath152 is zero .",
    "this fact can easily be understood in the model . indeed , multiple scattering of constituent quarks in the mean field has a lower probability compare to single scattering .",
    "single scattering does not polarize quarks and protons appear unpolarized in the final state since single scattering is dominant in this process . on the other hand multiple scattering ,",
    "excitation and decay of constituent quarks are correlated mechanisms , that is the reason of @xmath0hyperon polarization in the model .",
    "of course , @xmath153-quarks also will be produced polarized , but contrary to @xmath32-quark , which can easily recombine with constituent quarks of parent protons to produce @xmath0 , @xmath153-quark has no such possibility and should pick up virtual massive quarks generated at the condensate interaction . since polarization of produced @xmath154hyperons in the process @xmath155 is almost zero we should conclude that latter mechanism implies strong depolarization dynamics . thus we have to suppose different mechanisms of @xmath0 and @xmath154 formation at final state .",
    "those mechanisms have comparable strength at @xmath156 , but @xmath154-production has to be suppressed at large @xmath5 in agreement with the experimental data @xcite . to describe very different behaviour of polarization in other hyperon production",
    "it seems that we need very detailed knowledge of fragmentation dynamics @xcite which is unattainable at the moment .",
