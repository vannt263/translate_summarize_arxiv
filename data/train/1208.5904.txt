    "high frequency radio observations , above 50  ghz , bring information about relativistic particles ( see e.g. and ) . moreover , the efficiency of synchrotron emission , responsible for the radio radiation , increases as the electron energy increases , contrary to the bremsstrahlung mechanism which is the origin of the hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission @xcite .",
    "this makes observations at high frequencies very attractive for the analysis of high energy particles . for typical magnetic fields on the chromosphere and mildly relativistic electrons",
    ", gyrosynchrotron theory expects a peak frequency at approximately 10  ghz .",
    "therefore the caveat of submillimeter observations is that flare emission becomes weaker as the observing frequency increases . at the same time , at high frequencies , earth atmosphere becomes brighter and absorbs much of the incoming radiation .",
    "notwithstanding some x - class flares have shown a second spectrum besides the microwaves spectrum , with an optically thick emission at submillimeter frequencies , sometimes described as an _ upturn _ ( see e.g. , , ) .",
    "nonetheless , found , in a medium size flare , a second radio component peaking around 200  ghz .",
    "we call these cases double radio spectrum events .",
    "+ although different mechanisms were proposed to explain the double radio spectrum events @xcite , the conservative approach of two distinct synchrotron sources can fit reasonably well to the observations @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that observations at higher frequencies are needed to completely determine the radiation mechanism of those events that only show the optically thick emission of the second component , like in and , because of their strong fluxes , have much stringent requirements .",
    "+ therefore , the double radio spectrum bursts may represent a kind of events whose low frequency component is the classical gyrosynchrotron from mildly relativistic particles peaking around 10  ghz , and the high frequency component is also synchrotron emission with peak frequency around or above 50  ghz , depending on the flare characteristics ( in some cases above 400  ghz ) .",
    "+ in this work we present a detailed analysis of a double radio spectrum burst occurred during a goes m class event on september 10 , 2002 and observed in radio from 1.415 to 212  ghz .",
    "we ll show that the low frequency component is well correlated with the hxr observed with rhessi up to 300  kev , hence we can study the dynamics of the mildly relativistic electrons inside the coronal loop . on the other hand , the high frequency component ,",
    "which is also well represented by an electron synchrotron source , should be produced by a different particle population and , likely , in a different place .",
    "+ we first present the data analyzed , explain the reduction methods and give the clues that justify the interpretations in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "the spectral analysis , both at radio and hard x - rays is the kernel of our work , thus it deserves the entire section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we divide the interpretation of the event in two wide energy bands for the mildly relativistic and the relativistic particles in section [ sec : discusion ] .",
    "the consequences of our interpretations are presented as our final remarks in section [ sec : fin ] .",
    "the impulsive phase of the solar burst sol2002 - 09 - 10t14:53  started at 14:52:30 ut , in active region ( ar ) noaa 10105 ( s10e43 ) and lasted a few minutes .",
    "the flare is classified as goes m2.9 in soft x - rays and 1n in h@xmath0 .",
    "the burst was observed by various radiotelescopes around the world : ( 1 ) the united states air force ( usaf ) radio solar telescope network ( rstn , ) at 1.415 , 2.695 , 4.995 , 8.8 and 15.4  ghz with 1  s time resolution ; ( 2 ) the solar polarimeter at 7  ghz of the itapetinga observatory with 12  ms time resolution @xcite ; ( 3 ) the solar patrol radiotelescopes of the bern university at 11.8 , 19.6 , 35 and 50  ghz with 100  ms time resolution ( unfortunately , at that time , the channel at 8.4 ghz was not working ) ; ( 4 ) the null interferometer at 89.4  ghz of the university of bern with 15  ms time resolution @xcite and ( 5 ) the solar submillimeter telescope ( sst ) at 212 and 405  ghz and 40  ms time resolution @xcite .",

    "the null interferometer can be used to remove the quiet sun contribution .",
    "the sst beam sizes are 4  and 2  at 212 and 405  ghz respectively , and form a focal array that may locate the centroid position of the emitting source and correct the flux density for mispointing .",
    "below we comment more on this .",
    "since there are no overlapping frequencies between the different instruments , we have to rely on the own telescope calibration procedures , which were successfully verified along their long operation history .",
    "all of them , except the sst , claim to determine the flux density with an accuracy of the order of 10% .",

    "we also used complementary data : extreme  ultraviolet ( euv ) images from the extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ( soho / eit , ) , and full disk magnetograms from the michelson doppler imager ( soho / mdi , ) . during september 10 , 2002",

    "these bipolar regions persist in mdi magnetograms .",
    "figure  [ fig : field - evolution]b shows that the eastern negative polarity of the eastermost bipole rotates counter - clockwise around the positive one .",

    "figure  [ fig : field - evolution]c ( see a zoom of this image in figure  [ fig : mdi - hxr - sst ] ) shows the magnetic field at 14:27 ut on september 10 , this is the closest in time magnetogram to the flare occurrence at 14:52 ut . in this magnetogram the negative polarity to the east ( which is along the moat boundary ) has decreased in size as flux cancellation proceeds with the positive bipole polarity . along this period",
    ", flux cancellation also proceeds between this positive polarity and the nearby negative polarity of the bipole to the west . finally , this small bipole is hardly observable by the end of the day ( see figure  [ fig : field - evolution]d ) .",

    "the short duration and the narrow spectrum of this pulse reminds us of a similar one that also occurred during the rising phase of an event ( sol2002 - 08 - 30t13:28 , ) . at 212 ghz",
    ", the flux density time profile is composed of a single peak , with maximum at 14:53:20  ut with a total duration of around 2  minutes .",
    "there is no clear evidence of an extended phase like in and .",
    "besides , the hxr emission above 50 kev ends around the peak time of the radio emission , although the start time of both are similar , below 30 kev the emission extends longer .",
    "we note that this is one of the weakest goes events that has a clear submillimeter counterpart . indeed , as a comparison , the flare sol2002 - 08 - 30t13:28 ( x1.5 ) had a 212 ghz peak density flux of 150 s.f.u .",

    ", we analyzed the rising times at different frequencies . since the start time is subjected to big uncertainties , we compared the time elapsed between a reference time and the time at which the emission reaches a certain normalized flux density . moreover , we find more accurate to measure delays during the rising phase than during the , almost flat , maximum .",
    "we used two different normalized levels , 10% and 50% . for each frequency",
    "@xmath5 we found @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the times when the flux density reaches the 10% and 50% relative level respectively .",
    "the reference is the 75300  kev emission , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 defined when the hxr flux is 10% and 50% of the peak flux respectively .",
    "delays are then defined as @xmath10 and @xmath11 . to some extent @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are arbitrarily defined , but in doing so we simultaneously have an indication of the relation between radio and hxr .",
    "delays are determined with 0.5  s accuracy , derived from the worst time resolution we have in the radio data .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : delays ] ( bottom ) . above 10  ghz",
    "there is a continuous shift , which is , within the uncertainties , independent of the level ( 10% or 50% ) .",
    "this is qualitatively observed in the time profiles ( fig .",

    "previous works have shown that millimeter / submillimeter emission is delayed from microwaves ( see e.g. , , ) , but this is the first time to our knowledge that a _ spectrum _ of the delay is presented .",
    "below 7  ghz the presence of the short pulse distorts this trend .",

    "the dot  dashed yellow circle represents the absolute uncertainty in the determination of the radio source position ( @xmath130  ) ; this uncertainty is mainly due to the radiotelescope pointing accuracy . because of this large absolute uncertainty",
    ", it is not possible to determine where the submillimeter source is located inside the loop , at the footpoints or at the loop top .",
    "the two x - ray sources in the flare seem to be associated with the bright ultraviolet enhancement seen by eit encircling them .",
    "this brightening would correspond to an upper chromospheric loop also traced by the lowest energy rhessi isocontours .",
    "timing analysis does not reveal a displacement of the 212  ghz emission centroids in a privileged direction during the impulsive phase of the event .",

    "the existence of composed spectra is evident after 14:52:50  ut .",
    "we distinguish two components that we call the _ low frequency _ and _ high frequency _ components .",
    "the low frequency one has a peak frequency around 10  ghz , while the high frequency is maximum at around 35  ghz . because only the high frequency component shows clearly its optically thin part , we have used frequencies 50 , 89.4 and 212  ghz to compute the spectral index @xmath12 along the event .",

    "i.e. _ the index has an shs behaviour . to get insight into the characteristics of electron populations that produced this emission ,",
    "we have fitted the data to two homogeneous gyrosynchrotron sources using the traditional procedure .",
    "the suprathermal electron distributions are represented by a power law with electron indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the low frequency and high frequency sources respectively . at each time interval",
    ", a model was fitted to the low frequency and another model to the high frequency , the sum of both was compared to the data until the best solution was obtained . in general",
    "we fixed the source size , the magnetic intensity , medium density and the electron energy cutoffs ( see table [ tbl : parametros ] ) .",
    "we allowed changes only in the electron indices @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the total number of accelerated electrons .",
    "the fittings are shown in the figure [ fig : rspec - fit ] .",
    "it is evident that below 9  ghz the fittings are rather poor , which is an indication that the source is not totally homogeneous @xcite , nonetheless we may be confident on the electron index and number , which depend on the optically thin part , and on the magnetic field which is defined by the peak frequency . moreover , the good agreement with similar parameters derived from hxr is another indication of the goodness of the fittings ( see below ) .",
    "+    .fixed parameters used to fit the spectral data and maximum total electron number derived from the computations . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]         hxr spectra were taken from 14:52:00ut to 14:54:00ut in 4 second intervals , using front detectors 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 and 9 , for energies between 3 and 290  kev .",
    "we excluded the time bin when there was a change in attenuator state , from 0 to 1 . due to the high flare activity during this rhessi observation interval , we selected the background emission from the subsequent _ night _ period ( 15:18:48  15:22:12  ut ) .",
    "figure [ fig : xspec - fit ] shows the photon flux spectra at selected time intervals along with the fitting used to calibrate the data . using standard ospex procedures we applied a model of a thermal source , including continuum and lines , and a double power law .",
    "we found significant counts up to 300  kev , during peak time ( 14:52:59  ut ) .",
    "the thermal component is well represented by an isothermal source with a mean temperature @xmath15  mk and emission meassure @xmath16 during the hxr impulsive peak interval ( 14:52:50 - 14:53:00 ) .",
    "the break energy remains always below 80  kev , and the electron index below it is always harder than the index above .",
    "the later was used to compare with radio data because electrons with energies @xmath17  kev affect the gyroemission only in the optically thick part of the spectrum @xcite which we did not try to fit as noted before .",
    "we also have to take into account that hxr emission depends on the electron flux , therefore for non relativistic particles we should add 0.5 to @xmath18 to compare with radio @xcite , and , since the hxr spectra are computed below 300  kev , we should compare @xmath18 with @xmath13 , because relativistic electrons are needed to produce gyrosynchrotron emission for frequencies above 50  ghz . in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : delta ]",
    "we can see the evolution of electron indices .",
    "we observe that @xmath18 ( dot - dashed curve ) remains stable at the beginning and increases at the end .",
    "the low frequency index @xmath13 remains stable until 14:53:25  ut and is comparable to @xmath18 , then a sudden change takes place making it harder .",
    "on the other hand , the high frequency index ( continuous line ) @xmath14 is much harder than @xmath13 and @xmath18 as it was observed in previous works ( see e.g. , ) and it evolves in the same way as the spectral index @xmath12 .",
    "the optically thin emission above 50  ghz is produced by relativistic particles , while the optically thick emission at microwaves and the hxr observed by rhessi are emitted by mildly relativistic particles .",
    "we roughly divide the analysis in these two energy bands .      in order to understand the dynamics of the mildly relativistic electrons we compare the hxr emission , which it was observed up to 300  kev with the _ low frequency _ radio data .",
    "the comparison of the temporal evolution of both sets of data ( see figures [ fig : profiles ] and [ fig : delta ] ) supports the existence of trapped electrons because : 1 ) the duration of the impulsive phase in hxr is shorter than in radio and 2 ) the peak time in hxr occurs before the radio peak , even at low frequencies .",
    "therefore , the hxr time profile is not necessarily the representation of the injected electrons , since there are transport effects along the loop , or at least , hxr may represent the injected electrons that precipitate directly , without being subject to trapping .",
    "+ we can use the spectral analysis to derive the rate of the injected electrons in the emitting area in function of time . to do so ,",
    "we write a simplified continuity equation that depends only on time , since we are not interested on how the electron distribution changes in terms of energy , pitch angle , or depth . in this simplified model , we are interested only in the total instantaneous number of electrons , @xmath19 , inside the magnetic loop , incremented by a source , @xmath20 , from the acceleration site and decremented by the precipitated electrons , @xmath21 . therefore , the continuity equation should be @xmath22 integrating the above equation in the interval @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) and solving for @xmath25 yields @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "since we are comparing @xmath28  kev emission with gyrosynchrotron , we can identify the instantaneous number of electrons inside the loop @xmath19 with the trapped particles emitting the lower frequency component . on the other hand",
    ", the particles leaving the volume @xmath21 produce the hxr emission observed by rhessi . in our picture ,",
    "the low frequency component is produced all along a loop with a length of @xmath29  cm , while the hxr emission is produced in a narrow slab ( see _ e.g. _ ) with a very small surface ( see figure  [ fig : mdi - hxr - sst ] ) ; therefore , we can neglect the gyroemission produced within this small volume .",
    "furthermore , no change would be appreciated if one includes the particles responsible for the high frequency component since they are two orders of magnitude less than those that produce the low frequency component .",
    "( see table [ tbl : parametros ] ) + we divided the event in 10 second intervals and assumed that within these intervals the conditions do not change .",
    "the computation of equation  [ eq : injection ] is straightforward and the result is presented in figure [ fig : injection ] .",
    "since @xmath30  kev data have good s / n ratio only between 14:52:50  ut and 14:53:30  ut , ( see figure [ fig : xspec - fit ] ) the analysis is restricted to this interval , although is clear from the time profiles that there are emitting particles before and after .",
    "we observe a continuous injection with two peaks , one at the beginning and the second during the decay of the impulsive phase . to verify our results",
    ", we sum the precipitated electrons , @xmath31 , and we compare this number with the maximum number of electrons existing instantaneously inside the loop , @xmath32 = 4.7\\times 10^{37}$ ] . the difference between these two numbers maybe due to the fact that we are limited to the time interval in which the hxr data are statistically meaningful ; therefore , we can not track the precipitation until the end of the gyrosynchrotron emission .",
    "+    we observe that changes in @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] ) can be related to the injections occurred at around 14:52:51  ut and 14:53:15  ut ( figure [ fig : injection ] ) .",
    "the electron index @xmath18 lies around 5 , as @xmath13 for the same period , although , it increases slowly until 14:53:20  ut when it suddenly softens by around 0.5 . the difference in time evolution of @xmath18 and @xmath13 is an indication that the softening of the former is a consequence of the trapping .",
    "since @xmath13 has two constant values , we conclude that it is not affected by the medium . in the above analysis we rely upon the parameters derived from the radio and hxr data fittings .",
    "although we do not claim that the obtained solutions are unique , the fact that two independent fittings give very comparable results , give us confidence on them .",
    "+ the progressive delay of the radio emission observed in figure [ fig : delays ] must be interpreted differently depending on the frequency range . between 1 and 5 ghz , the short pulse dominates the emission during the rising phase ; therefore , its contribution should be removed to asses the delay of the main emission .",
    "this may lead to ambiguous results , hence , we preferred not to analyze delays in this range . in the range between 9 and 30  ghz",
    "lies the peak frequency , i.e. the optical opacity @xmath33 is approximately 1 , hence , the gyrosynchrotron self absorption is critical . the peak frequency ( @xmath34 ) of the low frequency component shifts from approximately 7  ghz to 15  ghz from 14:52:40  ut to the peak time around 14:5259  ut ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rspec - fit ] ) .",
    "since there is no change in the magnetic field , this can be interpreted by the accumulation of accelerated electrons inside the loop due to the trapping that increases its density , which is the dominant factor of the self - absorption mechanism .",
    "the shift makes the low frequencies more absorbed and thus increases the relative importance of higher frequencies .",
    "therefore , even with a rather constant @xmath13 ( fig . [ fig : delta ] ) the progressive delay should be observed . in our fittings at 14:52:40  ut we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "later on , during peak time @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we note that the emission is proportional to @xmath39 , hence , we have a relative amplification of @xmath40 at 7  ghz , while it is @xmath41 at 10  ghz .",
    "the relative amplification changes the rate at which the emission rises and , therefore , the time when the signal reaches a certain level with respect to its maximum .",
    "+      the centroid position of the emitting source at 212  ghz remains quite stable during the flare which may imply that the source is compact .",
    "moreover , it is placed 25  far from one of the hxr footpoints ( figure [ fig : mdi - hxr - sst ] ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained by for the sol2003 - 10 - 28t11:10 flare ; during the impulsive phase ( interval b in their work ) the centroid positions of the 210  ghz emission lie at approximately 10  from the center of one of the hxr footpoints ( 250300  kev ) , but are coincident with the location of precipitating high energy protons with energies above 30  mev seen in @xmath42-ray imaging of the 2.2  mev line emission . since for our work we do not have @xmath42-ray imaging to compare with , we should be cautious because the uncertainty in position is of the order of the position shift .",
    "+ since we observe the optically thin part of the high frequency spectra , the obtained @xmath14 is not affected by the medium and , within data uncertainties , it must be correct .",
    "on the other hand , we assumed a standard viewing angle @xmath43 which gives us a mean value of the magnetic field @xmath44 and total number of electrons @xmath45 . increasing ( reducing ) @xmath46 results in smaller ( larger ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "although we can not rightly evaluate @xmath46 with our data , we do not expect an extreme value for it since the ar is located not far from sun center ( e43 ) .",
    "furthermore we did consider an isotropic electron distribution .",
    "the total number of accelerated electrons is @xmath47 during peak time , and they should not produce enough bremsstrahlung flux to be detected by rhessi detectors .",
    "we confirmed this by computing its hxr emission using the bremthick program ( magenta curves in figure [ fig : xspec - fit ] ) which is orders of magnitude smaller than the mildly relativistic electron emission and remains below ( except during one time interval ) the background .",
    "+ the spectral index of the high frequency component @xmath12 shows a shs behaviour , but in this case we can not conclude whether its origin comes from the acceleration mechanism or from the interaction with the medium as before .",
    "we tend to think that the former should be the cause , since these are relativistic particles and their interaction with the medium should be less effective .",
    "the emission must come from a compact region with a strong magnetic field and the electron index @xmath14 should be harder than @xmath18 and @xmath13 , as is the case .",
    "these arguments support the evidence of the existence of a separated source where relativistic electrons are the responsible for the emission . +",
    "the progressive delay of the radio emission above 50  ghz ( figure [ fig : delays ] ) can be interpreted considering the initial hardening of the spectral index @xmath12 .",
    "if it is due to the acceleration mechanism that accelerates first the _ low _ energy particles and later the _ high _ energy particles , then , the progressive delay is a consequence .",
    "from our simple continuity model , we inferred the evolution of injected number of electrons , appearing as a continuous injection with two distinctive pulses separated by approximately 30 seconds . from the timing of those pulses , the first one produces the hxr and initiates the radio low frequency emission .",
    "the second pulse , while slightly stronger than the first , builds up into the radio emission but do not contributes to generate more hxr .",
    "this description suggests that the two injection might have different initial pitch angle distributions , because our fittings do not show magnetic field changes during the burst .",
    "the first injection might be formed by an electron beam aligned with the magnetic field direction , a fraction of the population is trapped by magnetic mirroring , while the other fraction enter the loss cone and precipitates , producing hxr .",
    "the second pulse should then be formed by a beam with a wider pitch angle distribution , or even isotropic , keeping most of the electrons trapped , producing radio emission , with little precipitation ( no significant increase in hxr ) .",
    "+ from our observations we conclude that the radio spectra can not be explained by an homogeneous gyrosynchrotron source , therefore we adopted a model based on two homogeneous sources since it is the simplest hypothesis that fits reasonably the data . although we do nt have images to support this assumption ,",
    "it is plausible that it is the case . as shown by the magnetic field evolution discussed in section 2.2 , we can conclude that the flare originates by the interaction of magnetic loops anchored in the mmf polarities .",
    "magnetic energy is probably increased in the configuration by shearing motions , in particular , the rotation of the negative polarity around the positive one .",
    "after magnetic reconnection occurs , two sets of reconnected loops should be present . in the example we have analyzed",
    ", we observe a set of loops in sxr ( and also in euv ) with two hxr footpoints . considering our description in section  [ sec :",
    "photosphere ] , we speculate that the second set of reconnected loops ( not visible ) could be anchored in the higher magnetic field positive polarity located north of the northern hxr footpoint and the negative polarity that rotates around the positive bipole polarity .",
    "such a set of reconnected loops would have a larger volume than the ones that are observed ; therefore , considering that the same amount of energy is injected in both sets , the emission in the second one could be less intense and , then , not visible .",
    "this second magnetic structure is also suggested by the 25  displacement of the emitting source at 212  ghz respect to one of the hxr footpoints ( figure [ fig : mdi - hxr - sst ] ) .",
    "while it has been shown that the reconnection of many different magnetic loops is more efficient to accelerate high energy electrons ( see and references therein ) , we might conclude that this complex mechanism operates even in medium size events as the one we analyzed in this work .",
    "+ another possible scenario is a loop structure where the _ low frequency _ source represents the coronal part of the loop ( with a lower effective magnetic field strength ) , and the _ high frequency _ source represents the low coronal or chromospheric footpoints of the loop ( with a higher effective magnetic field strength )",
    ". , using simulations of electron dynamics and gyrosynchrotron emission in a loop structure , demonstrated that two spectral components can be produced from one single loop , where mildly - relativistic electrons produce microwave emission in the loop , while relativistic electrons produce higher frequency ( reaching sub - thz frequencies ) emission from the footpoints .",
