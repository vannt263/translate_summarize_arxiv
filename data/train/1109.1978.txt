    "it is expected that the @xmath0-ray emission from microquasars is produced by relativistic electrons which are accelerated in the mildly relativistic jet .",

    "we propose that the @xmath0-ray emission from microquasars is mainly produced within the inner part of the jet in the anisotropic inverse compton @xmath1 pair cascade initiated by relativistic electrons in the radiation field of the accretion disk .",
    "if the relativistic electrons are injected close to the disk , then the disk radiation dominates over the radiation from the companion star . in the example calculations we apply the parameters of the cyg  x-3 binary system which contain very hot wr type star and an object on a very compact orbit . for such luminous stars in compact binaries as cyg  x-3 , the tev @xmath0-rays produced within the binary system",

    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum emerging from the radiation of the accretion disk is modified in such a way that its farther absorption in the stellar radiation becomes negligible in most cases .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-ray spectra escaping from the compact , massive binary systems , such as cyg  x-3 , should form in the cascade process initiated by relativistic electrons in the anisotropic radiation field of the accretion disk as recently considered in the case of active galaxies @xcite . in this paper",

    ", we confront these spectra with the gev @xmath0-ray observations of cyg  x-3 by the fermi - lat telescope .",
    "we adopt the classical geometry of a microquasar in which a jet is launched from the inner part of the accretion disk , perpendicularly to its plane .",
    "the disk is formed by the matter which is supplied by the companion star ( see fig .  [ fig_scenerio ] ) .",
    "the standard accretion disk model is applied in which the disk surface temperature is described by the power law profile : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the temperature at the inner radius of the disk , @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the example calculations presented below we assume typical values for the accretion disk , @xmath6  k and @xmath7  cm . for these parameters",
    "the disk luminosity is equal to @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , which is typical in the case of x - ray binary systems .",
    "we assume that the jet has a conical structure with the opening semi - angle of the order of @xmath11 . assuming that the total flux of the magnetic field through the cross section of the jet is conserved , we estimate the magnetic field strength in the jet at the height @xmath12 above the accretion disk on : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the strength of the magnetic field at the height @xmath5 above the disk .",

    "pair cascades are initiated by relativistic electrons contained within the emission region ( the blob ) moving along the jet axis .",
    "electrons scatter in the ic process the anisotropic radiation coming from the accretion disk formed by the matter accreting from the companion star .",
    "@xmath0-rays ( the thick dashed arrows ) are produced in the blob ( the dark circle ) moving along the jet ( the light shaded region ) via the ic scattering of the thermal disk photons ( the thin dashed arrow ) .",

    "therefore , we conclude that , except of the most outer parts of the jet , it is likely that particles accelerated in the jet will predominantly interact with the radiation field of the accretion disk in these two binaries .",
    "note , moreover that the surface temperature of the companion star is about two orders of magnitude lower than the temperature at the inner disk radius . because of that , we can safely neglect the effects of farther absorption and cascading of the @xmath0-rays , produced in the considered model , in the radiation field of the companion star .",
    "we consider the scenario in which electrons are accelerated in jets of microquasars in the classical shock acceleration mechanism .",
    "the electrons obtain the power law spectrum and they are distributed isotropically in the reference frame of the emission region ( the blob ) .",
    "the blob moves relativistically along the jet with the specific velocity @xmath31 , resulting in an anisotropic distribution of the electrons in the disk frame of reference .",
    "the electrons interact with the radiation of the disk producing the first generation of the @xmath0-rays in the inverse compton scattering process .",
    "while the electrons are confined in the jet by the magnetic fields and move with the bulk velocity of the blob , the @xmath0-rays produced by them escape from the jet into the volume above the accretion disk .",
    "the primary @xmath0-rays propagate in the dense radiation field of the accretion disk .",
    "significant part of them is absorbed , producing the first generation of @xmath1 pairs . as the result of the ic and @xmath0-@xmath0 absorption processes , the ic @xmath1 pair cascade develops in the whole volume above the accretion disk",
    "( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the cascade process considered in this paper we neglect the effects of bending of the trajectories of the secondary leptons by the local magnetic field which could be present above the disk .",
    "in fact , these effects can be neglected in the case of a dipole magnetic field above the accretion disk .",
    "such field drops fast with the distance from the centre of the disk ( proportionally to @xmath32 ) and is important only very close to the disk ( see @xcite ) . since the disk radiation field is highly anisotropic , the @xmath0-ray spectra produced in such a cascade process strongly depend on the location of the observer in respect to the axis of the accretion disk . in the subsections below we consider",
    "the input parameters for such a model and show the conditions for which the @xmath0-rays can both be efficiently produced and escape to the observer .",
    "+      +    the rate of the energy gain of an electron with the energy @xmath33 due to the acceleration process in the jet can be generally parametrized as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the so - called acceleration coefficient , @xmath36 is the larmor radius of electrons , and @xmath37 is the magnetic field strength ( in gauss ) at the acceleration region .",
    "we estimate the acceleration coefficient on @xmath38 in the case of the acceleration process occurring in the turbulent medium of the jet and/or multiple shocks , where @xmath39 is the velocity of the shock and @xmath40 is the speed of light .",
    "the primary electrons accelerated in the jet lose their energy due to both the synchrotron and the ic cooling . which of those dominates at a given location in the jet depends on the assumed parameters of the model , especially on the level of the equipartition between the magnetic field and the disk radiation field energy densities , @xmath15 .",
    "the synchrotron energy loss rate can be calculated from the formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the lorentz factor of the electron .",
    "the energy loss rate due to the ic scattering is more difficult to compute because of the strongly anisotropic radiation field and the complicated cross section . for the considered parameters ,",
    "the electrons scatter the soft radiation mainly in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime of the ic process .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron energy losses can dominate even for relatively small values of @xmath15 .",
    "we calculate numerically the energy losses of electrons on these two processes as a function of their energy and the distance from the disk surface ( applying the full kn cross section ) .",
    "the energy gain and loss rates of the electrons are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig_straty ] for different sets of the parameters describing the content of the jet , the acceleration process , and the distance from the base of the jet .",
    "note that except for the case of a very weak magnetic field in the jet and a large distance from the base of the jet , the acceleration process of electrons is saturated by the synchrotron energy losses .",
    "however , just below this saturation energy the ic energy losses can be easily comparable or even much larger than the synchrotron energy losses .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the significant amount of energy accumulated in primary electrons should be converted to the @xmath0-rays in the ic process of the disk radiation .",
    "closer to the base of the jet , where the magnetic field is stronger ( see eq .",

    "therefore , in principle , @xmath0-rays with energies clearly above the threshold of even present cherenkov telescopes should be produced in such a model .",
    "the maximum energies of the electrons , estimated above , are correct provided that their acceleration time is significantly shorter than the ballistic time of the plasma flow through the jet , @xmath46 , so the electrons can be considered as confined at a given location in the jet . only in such a case",
    ", the electrons can reach large energies close to the accretion disk , the source of the strong radiation .",
    "the ballistic time scale for the jet plasma can be estimated from , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the distance measured from the base of the jet in units of the inner radius of the disk , and @xmath49 .",
    "electrons are accelerated locally within the jet ( @xmath50 ) for the condition , @xmath51 let us introduce some extreme parameters for this last formula .",
    "the magnetic field strength in the inner jet is of the order of @xmath52 g , even for very small @xmath15 ( e.g. for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . the typical values for the acceleration parameter in the relativistic shocks are @xmath55 and the velocities of the microquasars jets are estimated on @xmath56 . even for this limiting parameters , these critical energies of accelerated electrons are of the order of @xmath57 gev .",

    "note that the velocity of the jet in cyg  x-3 is measured in the range @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "while , as the above calculation show , the acceleration in our model can be considered as local , the cooling process of electrons does not need to occur locally in the jet .",

    "more recently , a curved power - law was found to describe the gev data more precisely @xcite .",
    "the gev emission shows modulation , of the order of @xmath95 , with the maximum when the compact object is behind the companion star .",

    "is determined by the balance of the energy gain , and the synchrotron and ic energy losses , with the additional condition on the ballistic escape time of the electrons being shorter then the acceleration time .",
    "we showed that the simplified model of a purely exponential absorption will result in neglecting the @xmath0-ray bump at energy of @xmath113gev and a more steep spectrum in the multi - gev energy range . as a result ,",
    "the constraints on the location of the emission region within the jet should change in the full cascade scenario .",
    "we considered two possible regimes for cooling of primary electrons , i.e. dominated by either synchrotron or ic process . in the framework of those scenarios , we investigated the expected synchrotron and ic spectra and their dependence on the observation angle and location of the emission region .",
    "we found out that for specific conditions , multi - gev @xmath0-ray emission can be produced and escape absorption from the radiation of the accretion disks in microquasars .",
    "moreover , if the acceleration coefficient , @xmath35 , is as large as @xmath114 , even the tev emission can be expected , providing that the jet is weakly magnetized .",
    "we suggest that such a scenario may explain the presence of some of unidentified tev sources which do not show a clear radio nor x - ray counterpart .",
    "we also studied the effect of the possible transition of the inner part of the standard @xcite accretion disk into a radiatively inefficient , advection dominated disk on the emerging spectra .",
    "we found out that the resulting spectra are significantly different in two ways .",
    "if the injection of the relativistic electrons occurs far from the disk , the @xmath0-ray spectra observed at a large inclination angle are extending to higher energies due to the weaker absorption .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-ray emission in the case of acceleration of the electrons close to the accretion disk is dimmer , due to lack of the strong radiation from the hot inner part of the disk .",
    "finally , we also confront our model with the observations of the cyg  x-3 microquasar performed in x - ray and gev @xmath0-ray energy ranges .",
    "we conclude that our model can explain the gev @xmath0-ray emission seen from this source , provided that electrons are accelerated within @xmath115 from the base of the jet with a rather hard differential spectral slope of @xmath116 to @xmath74 .",
    "moreover relatively small observation angle is required ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "while the x - ray emission of cyg  x-3 is clearly dominated by the emission from the disk , a flat part of the sed seen by rxte above @xmath118 can be explained in the framework of our model as the synchrotron radiation of the primary electrons cooling in the jet , provided that the equipartition parameter @xmath15 is close to @xmath119 .",
