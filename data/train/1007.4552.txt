    "the giant planets thus far discovered around other stars exhibit a wide variety of orbital characteristics that are very different from the properties of the planets in our solar system .",
    "for example , exoplanets rarely reside in circular orbits and many of them have semimajor axes 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those of jupiter and saturn",
    ". however , at least one characteristic of exoplanets appears to be shared with the constituents of the solar system : planets often come in bunches . as wright",
    "2009 recently showed , 28% of apparently singleton exoplanets are later discovered to reside in systems containing two or more components .",
    "as the precision and time baselines of doppler surveys increase , and as more planets are discovered from wide - field transit surveys @xcite , direct imaging @xcite , and microlensing @xcite , the currently measured multiplicity rate will likely prove to be a lower bound .",
    "multiplanet systems are manifested in radial velocity ( rv ) time series as either a single - planet keplerian motion superimposed atop a partial longer - period orbit , or as multiple , time - resolved orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "those in the former category will gradually come into focus as the time baselines of doppler surveys lengthen , and these `` trend '' systems are becoming recognized as promising direct - imaging targets .",
    "the latter category , with their well - characterized orbits , are extremely valuable for understanding the origins of planets and the evolution of their orbital architectures @xcite .    observed deviations from pure keplerian motions",
    "reveal gravitational interactions among planets that serve as fossil records of past close encounters and/or convergent orbital migration @xcite .",
    "a prime example is the system of planets orbiting @xmath3  andromedae @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated through dynamical modeling that the current orbital configuration shows evidence of a violent planet - planet scattering event in the distant past .",
    "similarly , the two jovian planets in the gl876 system currently reside in a mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) that may be a reflection of differential migration after the planets formation @xcite .",
    "thus , the discovery of exoplanets in mmrs is strong support for the inward orbital migration that is often invoked to explain the common existence of giant planets well within the canonical `` snow line . ''    additionally , gravitational interactions among resonant planets can also place constraints on both the system inclination with respect to the sky , as well as mutual inclinations between the planets , and thereby remove the @xmath4 ambiguity and provide absolute measurements of the planet masses @xcite .",

    "typical exposure times of 60 minutes on the cat and 5 minutes on the 3  m yield a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath6120 at the center of the iodine region ( @xmath7   ) , providing a velocity precision of 4.05.0  . at keck , typical spectra",

    "each state of the markov chain is an ensemble of orbital solutions .",
    "the candidate transition probability function is based on the orbital parameters in the current ensemble , allowing the demcmc algorithm to sample more efficiently from high - dimensional parameter spaces that have strong correlations between model parameters .",
    "more details of this demcmc algorithm and associated tests of its accuracy will be presented in a forthcoming paper , ( nelson et al . , 2011 , in prep .",

    "the initial conditions of the n - body simulations are calculated by converting between keplerian and cartesian coordinates . in this paper",
    ", we consider only coplanar two - planet systems .",
    "for the n - body integrations , we use a time symmetric 4th order hermite integrator that has been optimized for planetary systems ( kokubo et al .",
    "we extract the radial velocity of the star ( in the barycentric frame ) at each of the observation times for comparison to rv data . during the demcmc analysis",
    ", we also impose the constraint of short - term ( 100 years ) orbital stability .",
    "we check whether the planetary semimajor axes remain within a factor of 50% of their starting value , and that no close - approaches occur within @xmath60 the semimajor axis during the 100 year n - body integration . any systems failing these tests",
    "are rejected as unstable ( regardless of the quality of the fit to rv data ) .",
    "thus , the demcmc simulations avoid orbital solutions that are violently unstable . in our demcmc simulations",
    ", this process is repeated for 10,000 generations , each of which contains 16,000 systems , for a total of @xmath61 n - body integrations in each demcmc simulation .    since the demcmc simulations only require stability for @xmath62 years , the orbital solutions in the final generation may or may not be stable for longer timescales .",
    "since nearly all of these systems are strongly interacting , we take this final generation ( 16k systems ) and demand that they also be stable ( according to the same criteria above ) over the course of a @xmath63 year integration , performed using the hybrid bulirsch - stoer / symplectic integrator mercury @xcite .",
    "only the orbital solutions which are stable over the course of this long - term n - body integration are regarded as being acceptable solutions .",
    "more details on the dynamical analysis performed and the results obtained will be presented in a companion paper , ( payne et al , 2010 , in prep . ) .",
    "we find that the n - body demcmc routine results for  are concentrated around solutions with @xmath64 days , i.e. close to the 2:1 resonance , and that they span a significantly smaller range of parameter space than do the double - keplerian fits .",
    "the n - body rv fitting aspect of the demcmc routine acts to shrink the parameter space , whereas the stability requirement in the routine has the effect of shifting the demcmc solutions towards the 2:1 period ratio mark , primarily by favoring lower periods for the inner planet .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody : a:1 ] the difference in the end - points of the two analyses , showing a scatter plot of the planetary periods at the end of both the keplerian analysis and the n - body analysis .",
    "we have applied the demcmc method described in   [ sec : nbodymethod ] multiple times using different values for the initial ensemble of orbital solutions .",
    "each time , these simulations reached qualitatively similar results to those of fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody : a:1 ] , but quantitatively there are signs that the method has not fully converged",
    ". therefore , we do not interpret the results as a precise estimate of the posterior probability distribution .",
    "instead , we use these results to demonstrate that there exist orbital solutions that are both stable and consistent with the doppler observations .",
    "most importantly , all our simulations indicate that the posterior distribution is concentrated at solutions with a ratio of orbital periods between @xmath65 and @xmath66 and very close to the 2:1 mmr .",
    "thus , we conclude that the current observations strongly favor orbital solutions in ( or at least near ) the 2:1 mmr .    next , we performed long - term stability tests for the 16,000 orbital solutions in the final generation of the n - body demcmc analysis .",
    "we find that @xmath67 of the orbital solutions are unstable over the course of @xmath63 years of integration .",
    "we consider the remaining @xmath68 ( of the 16,000 orbital solutions ) that are stable for @xmath63 years to be plausible orbital solutions given both the rv data for  and the requirement of long - term dynamical stability .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody : a:1 ] that the stable systems remain strongly clustered around the 2:1 period commensurability region . taking all of these long - term stable systems into account",
    ", we find that the data indicate that the inner planet has a period @xmath69  days , semimajor axis @xmath70  au , eccentricity @xmath71  and mass @xmath72  , while the outer planet has a period @xmath73  days , semimajor axis @xmath74  au , eccentricity @xmath75  and mass @xmath76  .",
    "we detail all the fitted parameters from this analysis in table  [ tab : nbodyplanets ] .    when we examine specific systems in detail , we find that the pericenter of the outer planet overlaps the location of the pericenter of the inner planet , meaning that the planets therefore experience detectable gravitational interactions .",
    "the systems typically undergo large eccentricity oscillations ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) over a period of @xmath79 years , while the semimajor axis varies on a shorter ( @xmath80 year ) timescale , with a range @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we note that the pdfs from the demcmc analysis are bimodal . to investigate the cause of the biomodality",
    ", we performed a similar n - body@xmath83demcmc analysis without the requirement of short - term stability .",
    "the resulting pdfs have a single broader mode consistent with the output of keplerian mcmc analysis .",
    "we conclude that the biomodal nature of the pdf from the dynamical analysis is most likely the result of demanding short - term stability .",
    "the overlap of the pericenters suggests that a mmr is needed to stabilize the system over long timescales by preventing close encounters .",
    "however , an analysis of the resonant angles @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the mean longitude and @xmath86 is the longitude of pericenter ) suggests that , for all the long - term - stable systems , the planets circulate , rather than librate , i.e. all of the systems are observed to have angular ranges for @xmath87 .",
    "we therefore caution that the current state of the observations and dynamical analysis can not confirm whether the system is truly in a resonant state , and hence further work will be required . a more detailed investigation ( payne et al .",
    "2010 in prep ) will probe the nature of these dynamical interactions in  and in greater detail .",
    "finally , we note that as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : nbodymethod ] , jitter is allowed to vary during the demcmc procedure .",
    "as such we find a best fit value for the jitter in the same manner as we do for the various planetary orbital parameters . from the  analysis , we find a large jitter value of .",
    "this is substantially larger than the value of 5  assumed in ",
    "[ sec : orbits ] , indicating that  has intrinsic rv variability at the high end of the observed distribution , or that there are other unmodeled sources of variability such as an additional planet in the system .",
    "however , a periodogram of the residuals shows no significant power above the noise . using the approach of @xcite",
    ", we can rule out additional companions with masses greater than 0.3  out to 1  au and `` hot '' planets with masses  @xmath88  within 0.1  au .",
    "additional monitoring at keck and a more in - depth dynamical analysis will help clarify the situation .",
    "the results of our n - body demcmc simulations for  are again more tightly confined than the results of the double - keplerian analysis . as an example of this we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody : b:1 ] the difference in the end - points of the two analyses , showing a scatter plot of the planetary periods at the end of both the keplerian analysis and the n - body analysis , as well as histograms for the same data .",
    "again , we note that the shift to an n - body analysis acts to concentrate the preferred region into a smaller area , while the stability requirements act to shift the favored parameters closer toward the 4:3 period commensurability .    as for the case of",
    ", we have applied our demcmc method multiple times using numerous randomized initial conditions .",
    "again , we find qualitatively similar results from all sets of the demcmc analysis , but with some indication that the results have not truly converged .",
    "as such , we interpret these results as demonstrative that stable systems exist which can fit the rv data , and moreover , the extremely narrow range of period ratios favored by the analysis ( @xmath89 to @xmath90 ) shows that the current observations strongly favor orbital solutions in or close to the 4:3 mmr .",
    "next , we test the long - term orbital stability of the orbital solutions identified by the demcmc analysis .",
    "for , @xmath91 of the systems are clearly unstable during a @xmath63 year integration ( i.e. , they experience a collision or a change in semimajor axes of more than 50% . )",
    "we find that @xmath92 of the 16,000 simulations remain stable for @xmath63 years .",
    "we interpret these as plausible orbital solutions consistent with the rv observations of hd 200964 .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody : b:1 ] , the stable systems occupy a region of parameter space corresponding to a region of paramter space near the 4:3 period ratio . taking only these long - term stable systems into account , we find that the inner planet has a period @xmath69  days , semimajor axis @xmath93  au , eccentricity @xmath71  and mass @xmath72  , while the outer planet has a period @xmath73  days , semimajor axis @xmath74  au , eccentricity @xmath75  and mass @xmath76  .",
    "we detail all the fitted parameters from this analysis in table [ tab : nbodyplanets ] .",
    "we find that most of the stable planetary orbits overlap , producing strongly interacting systems , resulting in significant oscillations in the the semimajor axes and the eccentricities of both planets .",
    "an example stable solution exhibits observable eccentricity oscillations ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) on an approximately 250-year timescale and semimajor axis oscillations ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) on an approximately 60 year timescale .",
    "again , as in the  system , all of the long - term stable systems examined here for  seem to be circulating rather librating .",
    "as in the  analysis , we find a jitter value of , which is larger than the empirical jitter estimate of @xcite .",
    "our rv measurements of the intermediate - mass subgiants 24  sex and hd200964 ( @xmath2  and  , respectively ) reveal the presence of a pair of giant planets around each star .",
    "our orbital analysis indicates that most , if not all , of the dynamically stable solutions include crossing orbits , suggesting that each system is locked in a mean motion resonance that prevents close encounters and provides long - term stability .",
    "the planets in the  system likely have a period ratio near 2:1 , while the  system is even more tightly packed with a period ratio close to 4:3 .    in both the  and  systems ,",
    "the planets reside well within the so - called snow line , beyond which volatiles in the protoplanetary disk can condense to provide the raw materials for protoplanetary core growth . for a pre - main - sequence , 1.5  star",
    "the snow line is located beyond 2 - 3 au according to the estimates of @xcite for realistic disk models including irradiation and accretional heating .",
    "it is therefore likely that the planets around  and  formed at larger semimajor axes and subsequently experienced inward orbital migration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of migration theory ) .    unless the planets around  and  formed with period ratios close to their current values , the two planets in each system likely migrated through disk interactions at convergent rates until they became trapped in an mmr , with the strong 2:1 resonance being the most likely endpoint of such differential migration @xcite",
    "the rarity of planets discovered with period ratios smaller than 2:1 accords well with the dynamical simulations of @xcite . in their simulation they considered the formation of two giant planets in a protoplanetary disk with initial period ratios just outside of 2:1 and final orbital configurations determined by the initial conditions and details of the planet - planet - disk interactions . from their ensemble of simulated planetary systems they found that only 3% attain period ratios closer than 2:1 , and none ended in stable configurations closer than 3:2 .",
    "the ability of planets to reach a resonance tighter than 3:2 is dependent upon a number of factors including the initial separation of the planets , disk viscosity , planet masses , remaining disk mass and size of the gaps opened by the planets @xcite .",
    "one key variable is the convergent migration rate , which if fast enough can carry the planets past the deep 2:1 mmr into tighter commensurabilities .",
    "the 24sex system is near the 2:1 resonance , which may be a reflection of a slower migration process compared to that which led to the extremely tight 4:3 configuration in the otherwise very similar hd200964 system .",
    "@xcite explored rapid migration scenarios leading to the attainment of high - order mmrs by low - mass planets migrating withing a gas disk .",
    "for the terrestrial planets they considered , mmrs with degrees as high as 8:7 and 11:10 were achieved for migration timescales of order @xmath98 years . however , to test whether such conditions can lead to high - order stable mmrs for the planets in the  system , and the 2:1 mmr seen in the  system , hydrodynamic considerations need to be incorporated into the models .",
    "@xcite investigated the formation and evolution of the gas giants orbiting hd45364 and found plausible models for the attainment of the 3:2 mmr observed in that system .",
    "simulations of this nature are beyond the scope of the present work and will be presented in a future contribution ( payne et al .",
    "2010 , in prep ) . for now , it is clear that just like the resonant planetary systems discovered before them , the  and  systems pose interesting challenges to theories of planet formation and orbital evolution .    we thank the many observers who contributed to the observations reported here .",
