    "for a number of years , the more so since the discovery of high-@xmath5 superconductors@xcite , the study of strongly correlated electron systems has been a major theme of theoretical condensed matter physics .",
    "the @xmath1 model is one of the simplest of such models@xcite . although high-@xmath5 cuprates are at least two - dimensional ( @xmath6 ) systems , it is also relevant to fully understand the one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath1 model in one dimension can be written in the subspace of no doubly occupied sites as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron at lattice site @xmath10 with spin @xmath11 , while @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the corresponding spin and electron number operators .",
    "this model has been solved exactly only for @xmath14 , where it is equivalent to the @xmath15 hubbard model , and at the supersymmetric point@xcite @xmath16 . in both cases",
    "the ground state at arbitrary density belongs to a broad class of interacting fermi systems known as luttinger liquids@xcite , which exhibit power - law decay of correlation functions with exponents characterized by a single parameter@xcite .",
    "additionally , for very large @xmath17 , the attractive heisenberg interaction term dominates the kinetic energy and the model phase separates@xcite@xmath18@xcite .",
    "the level of understanding of this model is derived mostly from small cluster exact diagonalizations@xcite , variational monte carlo methods@xcite and finite temperature monte carlo simulations for relatively larger system sizes@xcite .",
    "there still lurks , however , the question of whether the thermodynamic limit has been reached or not . in this paper",
    "we use the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite to study the ground - state properties of the @xmath1 model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the text is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the formulation of dmrg and its extension to arbitrary band - filling . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss our numerical results .",
    "we present ground - state static spin and charge correlation functions as well as electron momentum distribution functions .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "iv we summarize our results .",
    "the dmrg technique was developed by white@xcite in 1992 .",
    "it leads to highly accurate results for systems much larger than those which can be solved by exact diagonalization .",
    "the dmrg allows a systematic reduction of the hilbert space to the basis states most relevant to describe a given eigenstate ( @xmath19 the ground state ) of a large system .",
    "this is to be contrasted with previous real space renormalization techniques in which the lowest states are kept .",
    "a general iteration step of the method for open boundary conditions proceeds as follows : @xmath20 the effective hamiltonian defined for the superblock @xmath21 ( where the block 1 and @xmath22 come from previous iterations and 2 and @xmath23 are new added ones ) is diagonalized to obtain the ground - state wave function @xmath24 ( other states could be also kept ) .",
    "@xmath25 the reduced density matrix of blocks @xmath26 : @xmath27 is constructed , where @xmath28 , the states @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) belongs to the hilbert space of blocks 1 and 2 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath31 with the highest eigenvalues ( equivalent to the most probable states of blocks @xmath26 in the ground state of the superblock ) are kept up to a certain cutoff .",
    "@xmath32 these states form a new reduced basis in which all the operators have to be expanded and the block @xmath26 is renamed as block 1 .",
    "@xmath33 a new block 2 is added ( one site in our case ) and the new superblock @xmath34 is formed as the direct product of the states of all the blocks ( the blocks @xmath22 and @xmath23 are identical to blocks 1 and 2 respectively ) .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to problems such as the haldane gap of spin-1 chains , critical exponents of spin-@xmath35 chains , the @xmath0 kondo - insulator and two - chain hubbard model@xcite .    in our study of the @xmath0 @xmath1 model",
    "we have used the infinite - size version of the above iteration scheme to reach the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one immediately realizes , however , there is a problem in keeping the electron density fixed in the iteration process since we insert only two sites at each iteration ( which only makes the half - filling and quarter - filling cases invariant ) . to get around this ,",
    "we construct the reduced density matrix from two ground states that bracket the desired density .",
    "to be more specific , if our desired electron density is @xmath36 and the current superblock lattice size is @xmath37 , then we can always find two nearest integers @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that @xmath40 . assuming @xmath41 is the ground state wavefunction of @xmath38 electrons and @xmath42 is that of @xmath39 electrons , we build the reduced density matrix by the following weighting procedures : @xmath43 it is clear that the above construction ensures the desired constant band filling at every iteration .",
    "the success of this construction inherently requires that the ground state be homogeneous",
    ". therefore one should expect failure when the system goes into the phase separation regime .",
    "however , phase separation can still be studied using the finite size version of dmrg@xcite which does not require translational invariance .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to remark that in our computer program we have generally targeted three states since the ground state has two - fold degeneracy when the electron number is odd .",
    "the correlation functions are calculated when the iteration has converged .",
    "typically we start to measure them after the superblock size reaches 40 lattice sites .",
    "more specifically we measure the correlation between operators in the middle of the superblock .",
    "for example , the nearest - neighbor correlation is measured between sites 20 and 21 in the superblock size 40 ; while the second - nearest - neighbor correlation is measured between sites 20 and 22 in the next iteration ( i.e when superblock size becomes 42 ) .",
    "similarly the third - nearest - neighbor correlation is measured between sites 20 and 23 in the superblock size 44 .",
    "thus as we iterate our procedure to increase the system size we obtain correlations over increasing distances .",
    "finally , the desired ground - state correlations are obtained in a similar way as the reduced density matrix , @xmath19 the spin - spin correlation is measured in the following way @xmath44    before we discuss the numerical results , let us prove the following theorem : _ the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix retain their good quantum numbers when the corresponding operator of the superblock is a direct sum of the operators of its subsystems_. the electron number operator @xmath45 and the total @xmath46-component of the spin operator @xmath47 are two such operators . to prove such a theorem",
    "all we need to show is that the reduced density matrix is block diagonal in its good quantum operator subspace .",
    "let us consider one subspace at a time , @xmath19 the electron number subspace .",
    "then the most general form of the eigenstate of the superblock with @xmath48 electrons can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the basis wavefunction of block 1 with @xmath51 electrons , and @xmath52 labels other quantum numbers , while @xmath53 electrons , and @xmath54 marks other quantum numbers .",
    "thus the reduced density matrix elements have the form @xmath55 however according to the construction of the wavefunction we have both @xmath56 and @xmath57 leading automatically to the conclusion @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the reduced density matrix is block diagonal in the electron number subspace . in the same way one can show that the reduced density matrix is block diagonal in the @xmath59 subspace .",
    "we emphasize that this theorem can be explicitly implemented to accelerate the diagonalization of the reduced density matrix in the subspace of its good quantum numbers .",
    "for most of the numerical results reported here we have kept 110 states@xcite in blocks 1 and @xmath22 , the truncation error defined as @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the summation of the highest @xmath62 eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ) is of the order of @xmath63 . in table",
    "i we list some of the ground - state energies per site @xmath64 as a function of band filling @xmath36 and spin exchange coupling @xmath65 . in the same table",
    "we also list the results obtained from the exact bethe ansatz solution at @xmath16 .",
    "as can be seen immediately from the table , our dmrg results are highly accurate . to make it convenient for the reader we quote the coupled bethe ansatz equations@xcite determining the ground - state energy at density @xmath36 and @xmath16 : @xmath66 @xmath67)\\rho ( \\nu ^{\\prime } ) d\\nu ^{\\prime } , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 denotes shiba s function @xmath69 then the ground - state energy is given by @xmath70.\\ ] ]    since we are going to present our results in momentum space it is now opportune to discuss the way we analyse our data . first , because open boundary conditions are used in our dmrg procedure , we obviously loose translational invariance . to overcome this boundary effect",
    "we have done an average on the real space correlation functions before we do the fourier transform into momentum space .",
    "more specifically we obtain several real - space correlation functions of the same system by starting the measurement at different superblock sizes .",
    "for example we start our real - space density - density correlation @xmath71 measurement after the superblocks reach the sizes of 40 , 42 , 44 , 46 and 48 sites and then take the average among them .",
    "the final fourier transform is done in the usual way : @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the largest separation available in our measurement . for the results of this work we stop at a superblock size of 150 sites .    in fig .",
    "1(a ) we plot the electron momentum distribution function for quarter filled band at @xmath74 we see that this result is almost identical to the @xmath0 infinite-@xmath75 hubbard model studied by ogata and shiba@xcite .",
    "this is not surprising considering the fact that the small @xmath3 limit of the @xmath1 model is equivalent to the strong coupling limit of the hubbard model .",
    "here we have both @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath2 anormalies as indicated by arrows in the figure . unlike normal fermi liquids , however , the @xmath2 anomaly is a new feature which is related to the effect of the coupled holon and spinon representation of the normal electron@xcite .",
    "1(b ) shows the spin - spin correlation .",
    "there is a @xmath78 anomaly reflecting the nature of the antiferromagnetic exchange among nearest - neighbor electrons .",
    "1(c ) is the density - density correlation function .",
    "here one observes the @xmath79 @xmath80 anomaly only .    before discussing the effect of increasing @xmath3",
    "let us remember the two competing factors in correlation effects : @xmath20 the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic spin exchange @xmath3 favors the formation of spin - singlet electron pairs on nearest - neighbor sites which in turn leads to @xmath78 spin density wave ( sdw ) fluctuations .",
    "but eventually , when @xmath3 is large enough , there emerges a phase separation exhibiting antiferromagnetic sdw fluctuations .",
    "@xmath25 the kinetic energy @xmath81 term favors the delocalization of the electrons .",
    "but the pauli principle as well as on - site repulsion promote uniform separation between electrons synonymous with @xmath79 charge density wave ( cdw ) fluctuations . on the other hand the formation of bound singlet pairs due to @xmath3 term enhances @xmath78 cdw fluctuations .    in fig .",
    "2(a ) it is seen that as the antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath3 increases , the momentum distribution function is modified more drastically in the region @xmath82 where it changes from decreasing to increasing as a function of @xmath83 . notably the @xmath2 feature has been washed out for larger @xmath3 . besides , the critical exponent@xcite at the fermi wavevector @xmath76 seems to decrease as @xmath3 increases . in fig",
    "2(b ) we have plotted the spin - spin correlation function at quarter filling with @xmath84 and 2.5 .",
    "we see that at @xmath85 there is a clear @xmath78 anomaly , however at @xmath16 this anomaly is significantly weakened . at @xmath86",
    "the @xmath78 anomaly seems to have completely disappeared and the maximum is located at @xmath87 .",
    "this is an indication of singlet pairing between nearest - neighbor electrons .",
    "2(c ) shows the corresponding density - density correlation . at @xmath85",
    "there is only a @xmath79 anomaly which indicates the system is quite uniformly distributed .",
    "however as one increases @xmath3 the @xmath79 feature disappears and a new feature at @xmath78 develops which reflects the formation of nearest - neighbor pair . at @xmath86",
    "the behavior near @xmath88 has a tendency to flatten out .",
    "but the @xmath78 feature still dominates which shows singlet pairing .",
    "3 shows similar results for the band filling @xmath89 .",
    "again it is seen from fig .",
    "3(a ) that @xmath3 has the largest effect on the momentum distribution function in the regime @xmath82 . fig .",
    "3(b ) is very much the same as of fig .",
    "2(b ) : as @xmath3 increases the maximum in the spin - spin correlation function moves to the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath90 . but in fig .",
    "3(c ) the @xmath91 density - density correlation shows a clearer tendency towards phase separation near @xmath88 .",
    "both @xmath78 and @xmath79 anomalies are seen in the density correlation at intermediate @xmath3 as predicted@xcite .    as mentioned in the previous section",
    "our dmrg procedure is not applicable to the study of the phase separated regime .",
    "but we know from other numerical calculations there exists a @xmath92 @xmath93 indicating the onset of a phase separation .",
    "here we wish to argue that there exists another critical @xmath4 ( that is larger than the @xmath94 $ ] ) beyond which the system forms an @xmath95 @xmath96 , i.e. , a phase with no hole inside but having a thin interface at which the boundary electrons can still evaporate into the vacuum ( hole ) .",
    "this @xmath4 should be independent of the band filling since once the @xmath95 @xmath96 is reached there is only a single phase boundary between the hole region and the solid , and that is density independent . by definition ,",
    "the first instability of such an @xmath95 @xmath96 comes from the ability to dissolve a single hole inside .",
    "accordingly @xmath4 can be estimated from finite size exact diagonalizations by comparing the ground - state energy of a @xmath97-site heisenberg chain with that of 2 holes in the @xmath97-site @xmath1 model .",
    "this has been done by ogata et al@xcite on a 16-site system and by assaad et al@xcite with path - integral monte carlo simulation .",
    "both results seem to point towards @xmath98 .",
    "further , yokoyama et al@xcite have hinted the existence of such a @xmath4 in their recent variational monte carlo study of @xmath1 model .",
    "the same thing is also implied in the work of ammon el al@xcite .",
    "we have extended the dmrg method to allow calculations at arbitrary band filling and proven a theorem regarding the reduced density matrix that could accelerate the numerical calculation .",
    "we then used the extended dmrg procedure to study the @xmath0 @xmath1 model .",
    "it is found that our procedure gives highly accurate ground - state energy and correlation functions .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath2 anomaly first discussed by ogata and shiba in the electron momentum distribution disappears as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "it is argued that there exists a density - independent @xmath4 beyond which the system forms an @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
