    "core - shell quantum wires are vertically grown nanoscale structures consisting of a core which is covered by at least one layer of a different material ( shell ) .",
    "recently these structures attracted considerable attention as building blocks of quantum nanodevices @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of core - shell systems is a non - uniform carrier distribution in different parts of the wire @xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the polygonal cross section which most commonly is hexagonal @xcite , but may also be triangular @xcite , square @xcite , or dodecagonal @xcite .",
    "one of a controllable properties is band alignment @xcite , and an appropriate combination of sample size and shell thickness allows to induce electron concentration on the shell area @xcite .",
    "moreover , the present art of manufacturing allows for etching out the core part and producing nanotubes of finite thickness @xcite .",
    "both nanowires and nanotubes may be viewed as polygonal quantum rings if they are sufficiently short , i.e. shorter than the electron wavelength in the growth direction .",
    "the single - particle energy levels of a polygonal quantum ring are two- and fourfold degenerate and their arrangement is determined only by the number of polygon vertices .",
    "low energy levels localize on the corners , where effective quantum wells are formed .",
    "the number of such corner states is the number of vertices times two spin orientations .",
    "an energy gap may separate single - particle corner states from higher - energy side states , the latter having probability distributions peaked on the polygon sides @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the single - particle model to systems of few coulomb interacting electrons .",
    "we show how this coupling allows the formation of states corresponding to electron pairs , or larger clusters , that localize on the corners and whose energies lie in the gap between corner and side states of the uncoupled system .",
    "we focus on the formation and excitation of those many - body _ in - gap states _ , with particular emphasis on their fingerprints in optical absorption . as general motivations to study in - gap states in polygonal rings",

    "the hilbert space associated with our polar lattice is spanned by vectors @xmath7 , including the radial ( @xmath8 ) and angular ( @xmath9 ) coordinates , and the spin ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath11 of the single - particle hamiltonian elements in the basis @xmath7 ( explicit formulas are given in refs .   and ) allows to calculate single - particle eigenvalues @xmath12 and eigenstates @xmath13 , numerically .",

    "the quantum states of a single electron ( @xmath38 ) confined in a symmetric triangular ring have a periodic two- , four- , four- , twofold degeneracy , including the spin @xcite .",

    "for the side thickness @xmath39 nm the lowest six states are localized in the corners , with well - separated probability peaks in the areas between internal and external boundaries , and vanishing probability distributions on the sides of the triangle .",
    "the higher six states are distributed mostly over the sides of the triangle , with only little coverage of the corners .",
    "in addition , an energy gap @xmath40 mev ( @xmath41 meaning _ triangle _ ) separates corner from side states , which rapidly increases if the aspect ratio @xmath42 is reduced @xcite .     and @xmath43 coordinates are in units of @xmath44 ]    for @xmath45 uncoupled electrons confined in our triangular ring the low energy states form nearly dispersionless groups ( flat bands ) , of fifteen corner states followed by thirty - six mixed corner - side states , represented by the blue diamonds in fig .  [ fig : energy](a ) . clearly , the two flat bands are separated by approximately @xmath46 .",
    "the lowest group of many - body states has probability distributions qualitatively similar to the single - particle corner - localized states [ fig .",
    "[ fig : localization](a ) ] .",
    "the levels above the gap contain contributions from both , corner- and side - localized , single particle states and thus are associated with mixed corner - side probability distributions [ fig .",
    "[ fig : localization](b ) ] .",
    "the third group of states ( not shown ) is built up of only side - localized single particle states ( states 7 - 12 ) and associated with probability distributions of that same kind .",
    "the coulomb coupling between the two electrons does not change qualitatively the charge distributions around the polygon shown in fig.[fig : localization ] , as long as the coulomb energy is smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "instead , the energy spectrum differs qualitatively from the case of uncoupled particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) .",
    "the corner states 1 - 12 are only slightly shifted up , indicating that they correspond to electrons situated in different corners , in singlet or triplet spin configurations .",
    "the ground state is singlet and non - degenerate , the next energy levels are triplet sixfold , singlet twofold , and triplet threefold degenerate , respectively .",
    "these twelve states are only slightly spread within a narrow energy range , of about 0.25 mev .",
    "contrary to the behavior of the first group of states , the next three corner states , 13 - 15 , are shifted to higher energies , within the former gap of forbidden states for uncoupled particles , fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) .",
    "these in - gap states correspond to both electrons occupying the same corner area , with spin singlet configuration , and with an increased coulomb energy .",
    "the localization of these in - gap states is still like in fig.[fig : localization](a ) . obviously",
    ", due to the symmetry of the triangle , the charge density is equally distributed between corners .",
    "for the corner - side mixed states situated above the gap the coulomb energy is slightly larger than for the lowest corner states , because of the smaller spatial separation between electrons , but clearly much smaller than for the in - gap states and slightly larger than for the lowest corner - localized states .    the energy spectrum changes with the number of electrons .",
    "first of all it moves up due to the increased coulomb energy .",
    "if @xmath47 there are twenty many - body corner states , and twelve of them are lifted into the gap , fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](b ) .",
    "these states correspond to situations when two electrons of different spin occupy the same corner area while the third carrier is localized around one of the two other corners .    the energy spectrum of @xmath48 electrons , fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](c ) , resembles the one for @xmath45 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) ] . this is a kind of particle - hole symmetry in the fock space associated to the six single particle corner states . in both cases three states",
    "are shifted into the gap , which for @xmath48 correspond to two corners doubly occupied or one corner unoccupied . when @xmath49 , there are only six states associated with purely corner - localized probability distribution , with two corner areas occupied by a pair of electrons while the fifth electron stays on the third corner .",
    "as for @xmath38 , no in - gap state exists in this case , fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](d ) .    both single - particle states and in - gap many - body states",
    "can have zero- , two- , or fourfold degeneracies , due to the spin and orbital degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the degeneracies of the in - gap states for @xmath45 and @xmath48 are identical , and shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](c ) , and only of orbital origin since the spins are compensated .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath47 , for which all states are spin polarized . in presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface of the polygon",
    "the degeneracies are lifted .",
    "still , the corner localization is not affected , as long as the zeeman energy is smaller than @xmath46 , such that the mixing of corner , corner - side , and side states is not significant .",
    "the corner localization of the low - energy states suggests that we can obtain some insight from a hubbard model with on - site coulomb energy @xmath50 and inter - site hopping energy @xmath41 . nevertheless , even for such a simplified model , only the simplest case of two electrons on triangle",
    "can be solved analytically @xcite .",
    "the solution consists of in 9 triplet states insensitive to interaction and 6 singlet states .",
    "two singlets are non - degenerate , with energies @xmath51 while the other two levels are both twofold degenerate , @xmath52 one can notice that in the limit of @xmath53 the energies @xmath54 , whereas @xmath55 . at the same time all triplet states have by default zero energy .",
    "this spectrum is qualitatively similar to the energies obtained for the corner states of the thin triangle in subsection [ sec : triangle ] .",
    "therefore the energy difference between the gap states and the ground state is approximately the @xmath50 parameter of the hubbard model .",
    "the fine structure , i.e. splitting of the three gap states , is @xmath56 , for @xmath57 , in agreement with the previous results [ fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) ] .    for three electrons on the triangle numerical results within the hubbard model",
    "confirm twelve states shifted up by the coulomb repulsion .",
    "however , for @xmath58 , their fine structure consists of three degenerate levels ( 4 + 4 + 4 ) instead of four ( 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](b ) .    a simple connection between the main model and the hubbard one can be made if we keep in mind that , for a triangle with side thickness @xmath59 , there is a simple relation between the energy of the gap states and the pair coulomb energy @xmath60 .",
    "the gap states have an extra energy @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the distance between the two electrons sitting on the same corner , in units of @xmath63 .",
    "since the wave functions must vanish at the lateral boundaries @xmath62 should be smaller than @xmath59 . from the energy data we estimate @xmath64 . clearly @xmath65 is linear with @xmath60 . from the results of the hubbard model ,",
    "if we assume no hopping between corners ( @xmath66 ) , then we have @xmath67 for the situation with two electrons .",
    "to 5 electrons in the square ring .",
    "noninteracting case ( blue diamonds ) , @xmath35 ( yellow squares ) , and @xmath36 ( red circles ) . in the inset to panel ( a ) we show energy levels of a single electron . ]     and 3 electrons in the hexagonal ring .",
    "noninteracting case ( blue diamonds ) , @xmath35 ( yellow squares ) , and @xmath36 ( red circles ) . in the inset to panel ( a ) we show energy levels of a single electron . ]",
    "the single - particle energy gap between corner and side states decreases with increasing number of vertices @xcite . for a @xmath68 nm thick square ring",
    "this gap splitting is still sizable , @xmath69 mev ( @xmath70 meaning _ square _ ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_s ] , but indeed it increases for thinner sides , e.g. , to @xmath71 mev for 10 nm thickness . as a result , the range of coulomb coupling strengths @xmath60 allowing formation of in - gap states reduces . for @xmath45 four in -",
    "gap states are created , again corresponding to spin - singlet pairs occupying the same corner .",
    "the degeneracy of these states is 1,2,1 ( in energy order ) .",
    "as for the triangle , they reproduce the degeneracy of the single particle corner states up to a spin factor of two .",
    "the spectra become more complex with increasing the number of electrons .",
    "still , interesting effects occur , for example for @xmath48 . in this case",
    "two groups of in - gap states may be formed .",
    "one group with one singlet pair at one corner and the other two electrons in different corners , and another group , with a higher energy , but still in the gap , with two pairs at two corners .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_s](c ) for @xmath35 .",
    "this coupling strength allows formation of only one group of in - gap states for @xmath49 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_s](d ) ] .",
    "when the coupling strength is increased to @xmath36 then all states corresponding to two corner areas occupied by a singlet pair are shifted to energies above the gap and mix up with levels associated with corner - side - localized probability distributions [ red circles in figs .",
    "[ fig : energy_s](c ) and  [ fig : energy_s](d ) ] .    for a hexagonal ring of @xmath68 nm thickness",
    "the energy interval between the single - particle corner and side states is @xmath72 mev , which is comparable to the energy spacing within these two groups of states .",
    "the coulomb strength tested so far mixes higher corner and side states and in - gap levels can not be identified as before ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_h ] ) . still , theoretically , with a lower aspect ratio and weaker interactions such states could still be obtained .",
    "a single electron confined in a triangular quantum ring simultaneously exposed to a static magnetic field and circularly polarized electromagnetic field may be excited from its ground state to only four higher states if only the 12 lowest states are considered .",
    "two of these states are associated with corner - localized probability distributions and originate from splitting of the second level of the degenerate system ( @xmath73 ) while the other two states belong to the group of side - localized states and merge into the third ( fourfold degenerate ) level when the magnetic field is removed .",
    "two transitions , one to a state below and the other one to a state above the gap separating corner- from side - localized states , take place in the presence of each polarization type @xcite .",
    "considering now a pair of coulomb coupled electrons in the ground state ( @xmath36 ) , it may be excited with clockwise polarized electromagnetic field to one of the nearby states associated with corner - localized probability distributions , to one of the in - gap states and to three states associated with mixed probability distributions [ green solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption ] ] .",
    "one of the reasons why so many transitions are forbidden is that we do not take into account spin - orbit coupling and thus restrict transitions to pairs of states associated with the same spin .",
    "moreover , some single - particle transitions are blocked due to wave function symmetry @xcite .",
    "consequently , the few allowed many - body transitions are the ones for which the corresponding dipole moment matrix elements contain the appropriate combinations of pairs of optically accessible single - particle states .",
    "similar transitions to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption ] , to different states , take place when the sample is excited with counterclockwise polarized electromagnetic field .",
    "each two final states result from zeeman splitting of the same level and thus transitions induced by clockwise and counterclockwise polarized radiation merge in pairs when the external magnetic field is removed .",
    "th to @xmath74th of two electrons confined in a triangular ring versus magnetic field . ]    in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption ] we show the part of many - body absorption spectrum and density of states associated with the in - gap states for @xmath75 mt .",
    "two out of these states may be optically excited ( from the ground state ) , each one when the sample is impinged with differently polarized electromagnetic field .",
    "a splitting between the two in - gap states may be controlled externally through the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "these in - gap states may be optically excited only in the limit of sufficiently low or vanishing external magnetic field ( green solid and red dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption ] ) . in this limit",
    "the zeeman splitting is so small that states evolving from the two lowest levels of the degenerate system ( at @xmath73 ) do not coincide with each other [ fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic_spin](a ) for @xmath76 mt ] .",
    "this situation changes when the external field reaches @xmath77 mt . at this point",
    "the two lowest states interchange [ black solid and red dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic_spin](a ) ] and thus the _ new _ ground state originates from the second level of degenerate system . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic_spin](b ) the two lowest states are associated with different spin , so when the levels cross also the spin of the ground state changes , while the spin of all in - gap states is constant within the transition range [ green squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic_spin](b ) ] .",
    "consequently the dipole moment matrix elements between the _ new _ ground state and the in - gap states vanish and thus the states 14th and 15th became inaccessible ( black dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : absorption ] ) .",
    "still , the in - gap states may be optically excited even in the presence of higher external magnetic field , but from different initial states .",
    "such states evolve from the ground state at @xmath73 , e.g. the third state for @xmath78 mt [ blue dash - dotted line in fig .  [ fig : magnetic_spin](b ) ] , or originate from other states which allow excitation of the gap states in the limit of low magnetic fields .",
    "we studied energy levels , localization , and optical absorption of systems of few electrons confined in polygonal quantum rings .",
    "if the numbers of corners and particles allow formation of purely corner - localized states corresponding to close - by singlet pairs , then the states associated with such pairs are shifted to higher energies and form in - gap states in the energy ranges forbidden to uncoupled electrons , or mix up with levels associated with corner - side - localized probability distributions .",
    "an applied magnetic field ( in the range of tens of mt ) may lead to ground state spin change , for instance for two electrons towards a triplet , while the in - gap states remain singlets , which results in blocking of the excitations towards the in - gap states .",
    "this provides a possibility of experimental testing of the sample shape and interaction strength with a contactless control of the absorption process . in general",
    "a core - shell structure has a nonuniform dielectric constant , and thus the effective coulomb potential is different from the standard @xmath79 form used in our model .",
    "still , as long as the pairwise coulomb energy is below the gap between corner and side states our results remain valid .",
