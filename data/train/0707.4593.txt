    "<S> if the measured excess of events in the low - energy bins is due to a larger absolute neutrino flux , the lack of an excess in the high - energy bins can be explained by @xmath0 disappearance , which suppresses the event rate in the high - energy bins more than in the low - energy bins .    </S>",
