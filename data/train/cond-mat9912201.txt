    "the infinite - ranged spherical spin glass with @xmath5 body random exchange interactions has attracted significant attention recently for a number of reasons . among these are ( i )  it is exactly soluble in the thermodynamic limit both for its equilibrium properties and for its off - equilibrium macrodynamics ( at least in the sense of coupled equations for macroscopic order functions and _ anstze _ solving them in a long time limit ) , ( ii )  it exhibits replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) and aging glassy macrostates , ( iii )  the rsb is of the one - step kind ( 1rsb ) even down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "( in its discontinuous variant , 1rsb is believed to be symptomatic of many systems exhibiting glassy behaviour without hamiltonian disorder . )",
    "the original work @xcite and most subsequent advances have concentrated on situations where the exchange distribution is symmetric , albeit possibly with an external field .",
    "more recently @xcite an extension was introduced to allow for an additional ferromagnetic interaction , stimulated by the existence of many physical systems with large coherently coordinated attractors , such as most real spin glass materials with appropriate concentrations @xcite , neural networks @xcite , proteins @xcite , and error - correcting codes@xcite .",
    "this extension was however limited to two - body ferromagnetic exchange , with corresponding second - order ferromagnetic transitions . in this paper",
    "we extend the study further to include @xmath2 body ferromagnetic interactions for which the onset of ferromagnetism is first order .",
    "this is of relevance both for application to real systems ( for example , for error - correcting codes @xmath6 ) and since it brings in new features ( spinodal and thermodynamic transitions , metastability , and suppression of glassy ferromagnetism ) .",
    "the hamiltonian we use is @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are independent quenched random couplings given by a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance .",
    "the spins @xmath9 are real numbers subject to the spherical constraint @xmath10 we consider so that replica symmetry is broken for low temperatures , spherical spins so that 1rsb is sufficient at all temperatures , and infinite - ranged interactions so that mean field theory is exact . for @xmath11",
    "this reduces to the model of @xcite , for @xmath12 it becomes that of @xcite , but we shall be interested also in @xmath2 .    in considering the phase diagram",
    ", we will identify lines of four types . since there are first order transitions , in the statics we must consider the spinodal lines ( where a phase appears ) and the thermodynamic lines ( where it becomes thermodynamically preferred due to its free energy ) . a modified replica analysis employing",
    "the criterion of marginal stability ( ms ) leads to a different set of spinodal lines . finally , there are spinodal lines generated by a study of the langevin dynamics at long times . as in the cases",
    "studied previously , with an external field @xcite or a coupling @xcite , the dynamic lines are identical to the ms lines .",
    "the equilibrium properties of this model are given by the replica method @xcite in which one - step replica symmetry breaking is sufficient .",
    "this generates four order parameters governed by self - consistent equations .",
    "three of these describe the probability distribution @xmath13 of the overlap between pure states : @xmath13 has two @xmath14-function spikes , one corresponding to the self - overlap @xmath15_\\mathrm{av } \\intertext{and one corresponding to the mutual overlap } q_0 = q^{ss ' } & = \\frac{1}{n } \\left [ \\sum_i \\langle \\phi_i \\rangle^s \\langle \\phi_i \\rangle^{s ' } \\right]_\\mathrm{av } , \\qquad\\qquad s \\neq s'\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 refers to the thermodynamic average over the microstates of the pure state @xmath17 and @xmath18_\\mathrm{av}$ ] to the average over the quenched disorder ; the strength of these two are and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the fourth order parameter is the magnetization @xmath20 .    the replica free energy @xmath21 is , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath22 ) , given by @xmath23\\ , , \\label{repfe}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the replica indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 run from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and @xmath28 represents the outer product of the vectors . under the 1rsb",
    "@xcite this becomes @xmath29 where we have defined an average over @xmath13 : for any value of @xmath30 , @xmath31 stationarity of @xmath21 leads to the self - consistent equations .",
    "extremising with respect to @xmath20 gives @xmath32 and with respect to @xmath19 gives @xmath33 for the statics , equations ( [ eqnm ] ) , ( [ eqn1q ] ) , ( [ eqn2q ] ) and ( [ eqnx ] ) are solved for @xmath20 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we also find it useful to consider the free energy with the magnetization constrained ; in this case ( [ eqnm ] ) does not apply . for the calculation under marginal stability ,",
    "we abandon ( [ eqnx ] ) , and instead insist that the lowest eigenvalue of the hessian matrix of ( [ repfe ] ) in the @xmath36 should vanish , which is to say that the system should be marginally stable against small fluctuations in the overlaps .",
    "the resulting equation is @xmath37",
    "the dynamics used are given by the langevin equation @xmath38 and @xmath39 is introduced to enforce the spherical constraint ( [ spher ] ) .",
    "the standard generating function procedure @xcite yields a self - consistent mean - field equation of motion : @xmath40 this equation can not be solved exactly , but it is possible to obtain self - consistent equations using the standard aging assumption@xcite @xmath41 taking the limit of long times and setting all the time derivatives to zero .",
    "the calculation follows @xcite and , as expected , gives the equations ( [ eqnm ] ) , ( [ eqn1q ] ) , ( [ eqn2q ] ) , and ( [ ms ] ) obtained in the ms version of the replica analysis , identifying @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the rle played by @xmath19 is that of a factor in a modified fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( qfdt ) in the non - ergodic phase : @xmath44 there is a direct correspondence between the breaking of replica symmetry and the breaking of ergodicity .",
    "phase diagrams for a characteristic set of situations are exhibited in figures  [ r1][r5 ] ; the new results are in figures  [ r3][r5 ] but figures  [ r1 ] and [ r2 ] are included for orientation ( as well as completeness ) . in each case @xmath45 is chosen , but similar results apply for other @xmath46 .",
    "the remaining figures show the free energies of systems with constrained magnetizations : these assist in the interpretation of the phase diagrams which result when the constraint is removed and the free energy minimized with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ r1 ] is for @xmath11 @xcite , in which case the second term of ( [ ham ] ) corresponds to an applied field @xmath47 .",
    "it is helpful to recall its features .",
    "for @xmath48 the only stable state is paramagnetic .",
    "for @xmath49 between @xmath50 and @xmath51 there is a continuous one - step replica symmetry breaking ( c1rsb ) transition from paramagnet to spin glass , with @xmath52 at the transition ; the transition temperature is the same statically and dynamically , and the transition coincides with the onset of almeida  thouless instability . at @xmath53 ,",
    "this temperature reaches a maximum of @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    "there is a discontinuous one - step replica symmetry breaking ( d1rsb ) transition from paramagnet to spin glass , with @xmath56 at the transition .",
    "the transition temperature is higher for dynamics ( or equivalently marginal stability ) than for statics ; both transition temperatures are higher than that at which small fluctuation almeida  thouless instability would onset were it not preempted by the discontinuous transition .",
    "all three temperatures , which we shall label @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 respectively , fall as @xmath49 falls ; for future use we define @xmath60 at @xmath61 . in considering the various systems with ferromagnetic interactions discussed below it will be helpful to make reference to this case .    before passing to the generalized models",
    "it is also useful to consider the system with @xmath62 ( for which case the value of @xmath1 is irrelevant ) but with constrained magnetization . for @xmath63 the free energy as a function of @xmath20",
    "has the form shown in figure  [ mj0](a ) : the stable state is replica symmetric for all @xmath20 . as @xmath64 is reduced below @xmath54 the character of @xmath65 changes as shown in figure  [ mj0](b ) , or in more detail in figure  [ mj0](c ) : a gap opens up in which there is no longer an rs solution stable against almeida ",
    "thouless fluctuations , and a region in which there is a new rsb solution appears .",
    "the rsb solution spans the gap in the rs solution , with an overlap at its lower end .",
    "that is , the upper end - point of the rsb curve coincides with the lower end - point of the high-@xmath20 section of the rs curve , but the lower end - point of the rsb curve lies on the low-@xmath20 section of the rs curve below its end - point .",
    "the rsb solution has monotonically increasing @xmath66 as @xmath20 is lowered below the upper connection point of rs and rsb .",
    "the coincidence at the upper end of the gap is related to the possibility of a continuous rsb , while the overlap at the lower end is related to a discontinuous rsb . as the temperature",
    "is lowered further the gap in the rs curve and range of rsb both grow , with the latter extending to @xmath67 at @xmath68 , as shown in figure  [ mj0](d ) . for @xmath62",
    "the minimum of @xmath65 is always at @xmath67 which is therefore the unconstrained magnetization . for @xmath69 ,",
    "where both rs and rsb solutions exist at @xmath67 , the latter is favoured .",
    "increasing @xmath47 for @xmath11 modifies the curves @xmath65 and moves the minimum to a finite magnetization @xmath70 . for @xmath63",
    ", @xmath65 remains only rs and the unconstrained state remains paramagnetic .",
    "for @xmath71 , where there is an rsb curve which does not extend to @xmath67 , the sequence of events on increasing @xmath49 is as follows : ( i )  the minimum moves out along the lower section of the rs curve , ( ii )  it crosses into the region where the rs and rsb curves overlap and both have minima , the rsb being favoured so that a d1rsb transition to a spin glass takes place ; ( iii )  the rsb minimum continues to move out , while the rs minimum reaches the end of the lower rs branch and disappears , corresponding to crossing the almeida ",
    "thouless line , but the rs minimum is irrelevant and no phase change occurs ; ( iv )  the rsb minimum moves up the rsb curve until this gives way smoothly to the upper section of the rs curve and a c1rsb transition back to a paramagnet takes place . for @xmath72 again the rsb curve does extend to @xmath67 and the system already favours the spin glass solution at @xmath61 , so only ( iii ) and ( iv ) occur .    for @xmath73 ferromagnetism becomes possible with effective field @xmath74 determined self - consistently . figure  [ r2 ] shows the phase diagram obtained recently @xcite for @xmath12 . at low @xmath75 the frustration due to",
    "the disorder in @xmath76 continues to prevent ferromagnetism , as does entropy as the temperature is raised , leading to behaviour similar to that for @xmath62 . at a temperature - dependent @xmath75",
    "a continuous ferromagnetic transition takes place and the system goes over to a solution whose magnetization rises continuously with @xmath75 .",
    "the ferromagnetic region is split into two parts , non - glassy rs ( at higher @xmath75 , @xmath64 ) and glassy 1rsb ( at lower @xmath75 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "the transition between them directly mirrors the behaviour of figure  [ r1 ] with @xmath49 replaced by the self - consistently determined @xmath77 and is d1rsb ( c1rsb ) for @xmath75 less ( greater ) than the value @xmath78 for which @xmath79 .",
    "( the transition temperature reaches the maximum of @xmath54 at @xmath80 . )",
    "again there is an almeida  thouless curve which lies beneath the d1rsb transition line for @xmath81 but is coincident with the c1rsb transition line for @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the value of @xmath75 at which @xmath84 .",
    "the transitions are apparent in @xmath65 through behaviour directly analogous to that discussed above for @xmath11 . in the case of @xmath12",
    "the ferromagnetic onsets are second order , with the minimum in @xmath65 moving away from @xmath67 continuously as @xmath75 is increased across the transition lines .",
    "figure  [ mr2 ] illustrates several aspects of the phase diagram : [ mr2](a ) shows a region of non - glassy ferromagnetism above @xmath54 , where @xmath65 is rs throughout its range ; [ mr2](b ) shows a non - glassy ferromagnet between @xmath54 and @xmath85 for @xmath81 , with a gap in the rs curve and an rsb section but with the minimum in the lower rs region ; [ mr2](c ) shows a glassy ferromagnet at the same temperature , where the minimum is now in the rsb region , the system having undergone a d1rsb transition ; [ mr2](d ) shows a non - glassy ferromagnet at the same temperature for @xmath86 , with the minimum now in the upper rs region , the system having undergone a c1rsb transition .",
    "for @xmath2 the ferromagnetic transitions are first order , with the @xmath67 solution always locally stable . as noted before , there are two kinds of transition as @xmath75 is increased or @xmath64 is decreased : a spinodal transition at which a secondary minimum appears in @xmath65 at a finite @xmath20 whilst the lowest minimum is at @xmath67 , and a thermodynamic transition at which the finite @xmath20 minimum becomes lower than that at @xmath67",
    ". figures  [ r3][r5 ] show the full phase diagrams for @xmath45 and @xmath87 respectively , as characteristic illustrations of systems with first order transitions for which @xmath1 is less than , equal to , and greater than @xmath0 . only for the case @xmath3 is a glassy ferromagnet found with glassy / non - glassy transitions ; this transition is analogous to that for the case @xmath12 , with d1rsb for @xmath75 less than @xmath78 and c1rsb for @xmath86 .",
    "figure  [ mr3 ] illustrates the underlying character of @xmath65 , which drives the static transitions .",
    "figures  [ mr3](a , b ) show the situation for @xmath63 , ( a ) in a region of spinodal ferromagnetism , ( b ) of thermodynamic ferromagnetism . figures  [ mr3](c  f ) are for @xmath69 , showing the effect of increasing @xmath75 : ( c ) is in the spin glass phase , passing to an rsb ferromagnet ( d ) via a spinodal transition , with the rsb ferromagnet thermodynamically preferable to the spin glass in ( e ) , and eventually crossing via a continuous transition into an rs ferromagnet in ( f ) .",
    "the smallest self - consistent value of @xmath77 ( i.e. that at the spinodal transition ) increases with @xmath1 , and in fact for @xmath6 at any @xmath72 it is exactly that corresponding to the c1rsb line in figure  [ r1 ] so that the transition is directly into an rs ferromagnet .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ mr45](a ) .",
    "( note that since the c1rsb line coincides with the almeida ",
    "thouless line , the rs ferromagnet does become unstable against rsb fluctuations at the transition . ) for @xmath88 the smallest @xmath77 is beyond this critical value and carries the system well into the rs region , so there is no trace of an rsb ferromagnet .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ mr45](b ) .",
    "hence for all @xmath4 glassy ferromagnetism is suppressed . in the case of @xmath6",
    "the minimum @xmath77 corresponds to the same value of @xmath75 for any @xmath72 , yielding a vertical transition line between spin - glass and rs ferromagnet .    for @xmath88 ( as in figure  [ r5 ] )",
    "the ferromagnet becomes marginally stable against small fluctuations in @xmath20 along its spinodal transition line @xmath89 .",
