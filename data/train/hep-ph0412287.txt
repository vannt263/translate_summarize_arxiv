    "the analysis of the screening in @xmath0plasma performed keeping the analogy with the classical treatment of an electric plasma @xcite gave as result a slight difference in the screening behavior with distance , with respect to the more standard , exponential decay @xcite .",
    "now this analysis is pushed further by introducing the effect of the real gluons which are certainly present in such situations .",
    "once the relevance of the gluons in the quark - quark correlation functions is taken into account one in lead , unavoidably , to consider also the quark - gluon correlations and this is performed in the present paper . while a definite quark population is taken as a initial condition of the problem , the gluon population is considered of thermal origin and is given therefore in terms of a bose - einstein density , together with this population also the creation of @xmath0pair is considered , with a corresponding fermi - dirac density .",
    "being interested in the large distance effects , that part of the interaction of real gluons with quark is considered , which correspond to a @xmath1channel exchange of a virtual gluon , so that it has , suitably redefining color and spin factors , the same form of quark - quark interaction .",
    "the result is a general behavior of the correlation function not very different from that previously found in a pure @xmath0plasma , since the analytical form is however awkward a numerical investigation has been performed for both situations without gluons and with gluons .",
    "the behavior differs little from the exponential , in both case the possibility of small oscillations is found , but only when the correlation function is already very small .",
    "a discussion of the range of values for which the model can be meaningful and also a comparison with some different treatments and results , in particular with the formulation using the termal green functions are briefly presented @xcite .",
    "three short appendices contains some details of the needed calculations .",
    "as it has been explained in the introduction the basic equation for the correlation functions have the same general features as for the pure @xmath2 populations , but we must distinguish two possible correlation , the two - fermion case and the fermion - boson case . in principle",
    "we should look also at the two - boson correlation function , since however our main interest is in the two - fermion correlations while keeping into account the boson - fermion correlation , that enter directly in the equation for the two - fermion function we neglect the effect of the pure bosonic correlation : in so doing we are forced to bound our discussion to situation where the fermion density is dominant , having in mind the nucleus - nucleus collision there are certainly situations , of not too large temperature , where this condition is satisfied .",
    "the ways in which the usual determination of the shielding has been adapted to the case of non commuting charges have been presented in the provios paper and will not be discussed here , only the integrodifferential equation for the two body correlation is reproduced    @xmath3\\bigg ] \\label{2-correlation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the variables @xmath4 embody both the space variables @xmath5 and the color indices and the integration over the auxiliary variable @xmath6 takes care of the non commutativity of the charges .",

    "the inversion of the fourier transform leads to an expression that is very little transparent , it is reported for completeness in [ app.c ] ; the correlation function in real space has been computed numerically , by means of standard integration subroutines @xcite , starting form the following integral @xmath80 in fig.[qq - correlation ] and fig.[qq - gg - correlation ] the correlation function without and with gluons for different choices of temperature , at fixed coupling constant @xmath81 and initial quark density @xmath82 , is shown . in both the cases it can be noted that the damping of the correlation , if not exponential , differs very little from that behavior ; there is also a long distance @xmath5 region ( with @xmath83 at @xmath84 ) , where the correlation begin to oscillate , but the amplitude of these oscillations is very small , being present when the correlation has been already much damped .",
    "the previous plots give a good overall description of the behavior of the correlation function , but do not show immediately how these functions differ from a yukawa shape @xmath85 ; in order to give a more complete description of this property in fig.[qq - gg - correlation - lenght ] the expression @xmath86 is plotted .",
    "if the yukawa shape was exact , we would find a straight line ; these plots confirm ( obviously ) that the gluons make the damping weaker , moreover the correlation function becomes slightly farther from a yukawa shape .",
    "it can be seen that the effect associated to the gluon presence is to produce , at fixed temperature , a perceptible increase in the value of the correlation and consequently a displacement towards higher @xmath5 values of the region where the correlation function begin to oscillate . for a detailed analysis of the values of energies , quark , anti - quark and gluon densities",

    "the inclusion of the gluon in the effect of mutual screening in a @xmath87plasma refines a previous analysis given in term of a pure quark - antiquark population , and it confirms the results . in particular",
    "the correlation length and the shape of the damping is still the same for @xmath18 and @xmath2 , so that it must reflect in the same way in the meson and baryon production .",
    "an item that requires some condideration is the comparison with other ways of dealing with the same phenomenon .",
    "the treatment given in term of strong coupling on the lattice is difficult to compare with @xcite because it is very different since the beginning , more similar are the treaments in terms of thermal green function as in @xcite . in that case one extracts the contribution of the pole of the propagator in momentum space so that a precise yukawa - like decay of the correlation function is certainly produced .",
    "the treatment here presented is purely static , so it seems that it lacks of some effects that are present in the other treatment , does it contains also someting more ?",
    "perhaps what is more is seen looking at the structure of the coupled equation ( [ color - eq ] ) : the interaction of one particle takes place with other particles which are already correlated , so that at least at the level of two - fermion distribution a self consistent treatment of the correlations is performed .",
    "it must be noted that the dependence of the shielding effect on the temperature has two origins : one is the kinematical effect that is present in every plasma - like system , the other is dynamical and typical of a relativistic system since it comes from the thermal production of particles , both gluons and @xmath2 pairs .",
    "the two processes have not the same role because initially there are more quarks than antiquarks , however , looking at the evolution of the chemical potential fig.[betamu ] , we see that there is an equivalent temperature , not extremely high , at which the effects of the initial condition become very small .",
    "one could also ask what the answer would be in the opposite limit , low temperature and high density , which might be realized inside a neutron star , but in this situation the pauli principle would be very relevant and one should start from the consideration of a degenerate relativistic plasma , what is not attempted in this paper .      as explained previously only the quark - gluon interaction corresponding to a gluon exchange in @xmath1channel is considered . for this amplitude tha color structure",
    "is usually given in mixed form @xcite as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "we investigate briefly the problem in this form .",
    "assume the baryonic density , @xmath95 the quark density minus the antiquark density , as given and find the simultaneous production of gluons and of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the expression for the baryonic density is simple when the quark mass can be neglected , or gives at most a small correction , in this case for the density we get : @xmath96 \\label{initial - density}\\ ] ] in particular the antiquark density is given by @xmath97\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and for the weight we get @xmath99 resulting from a factor 2 for the spin , a factor 3 for the color , a factor 2 for the flavor because we consider only @xmath100 and @xmath101 quarks .    from eq ( [ initial - density ] )",
    "it follows : @xmath102 from this relation we see the conditions qualitatively well known in which the mass term is negligible : either @xmath103 or @xmath104 , form now on we shall assume that at least one of these conditions is fulfilled and the mass term is dropped . solving the equation for @xmath105 we find @xmath106^{\\frac{2}{3}}-3^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\,\\pi^2}{3^{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\,\\left[\\left(\\frac{27\\,\\pi^2\\,x}{g_f}\\right ) \\left(1+\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\,g_f}{9\\,\\sqrt 3\\ , x}\\right)^2 } \\right)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{3}}}\\ ] ] with @xmath107 . in this way we get the actual expression of @xmath108 in terms of @xmath109 and @xmath12 ,",
    "the total density which appears in the previous formulae is given by @xmath110 .",
    "it is now possible to give a semi - quantitative analysis of the different densities which are relevant for our problem : we start assigning a density @xmath109 which we take equal to 2 @xmath111 . in fig.[betamu ] , fig.[ndensity ] and fig.[gammanratio ] the values of @xmath112 , @xmath113 and the ratio @xmath114 as functions of @xmath115 are shown .",
