    "ordered metal nanoparticle arrays have become an active area of research due to their potential applications in nonlinear optics and nanophotonics below the diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "however , practical realization of such applications require that cost - effective and reliable processes be developed for the manufacturing of ordered metal nanoarrays .",
    "physical phenomena that lead to the formation of patterns with characteristic length scales and predictable time scales could be exploited in designing such nanomanufacturing processes .",
    "for instance , pattern formation following ion irradiation has been known to modify surface topography @xcite .",
    "rippling of surfaces under ion irradiation appears to be primarily due to an instability resulting from the competition between ion erosion and smoothening due to surface diffusion with the length and time scales determined by ion flux , surface temperature and surface diffusion parameters @xcite**. * * another route to creating nanopatterns could be through instabilities of a thin fluid film leading to spatial patterns with length and time scales that depend on the thermophysical material properties such as interfacial tension , contact angle with the substrate , fluid viscosity and , for ultrathin films , long range dispersion forces such as the van der waal s interaction .",
    "an example especially pertinent to thin film pattern formation is the hydrodynamic dewetting instability such as spinodal dewetting which occurs when attractive intermolecular forces exceed the stabilizing effect of interfacial tension @xcite . under such conditions ,",
    "spontaneous film thickness fluctuations could be amplified and this will result in the breakup of the film leading eventually to the formation of drops / particles with well defined spatial order @xcite . dewetting dynamics leading to particles",
    "have been studied in detail in polymer films that are in the liquid state close to room temperature @xcite .",
    "however , ordered nanoparticle formation via dewetting in metal films has remained relatively unexplored , primarily due to the high temperatures required to melt the metal and observe dewetting within practical time scales .",
    "earlier work has shown that ion - irradiation of ultrathin pt films on @xmath1 substrates results in dewetting patterns with spatial order @xcite .",
    "more recently our group has shown that multiple @xmath8 pulsed laser melting of nanoscopic co films can lead to short- and long - range spatial order @xcite .",
    "however , the the relationship of particle spacing @xmath2 and diameter @xmath3 with film thickness @xmath4 was not determined .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear whether thin film hydrodynamic models could help predict such relationships at nanometer length scales . another unanswered question is whether dewetting under multiple cycles of phase change , i.e. melting and resolidification , would lead to robust final states . in this article",
    ", we address the above questions quantitatively by analyzing the results of a series of systematic experiments and interpreting them with the aid of thin film hydrodynamic theories .",
    "such comprehensive understanding could help in knowledge - based design of nanomanufacturing facilities for ordered metal nanoarrays .",
    "specifically , we investigate the evolution of dewetting patterns in nanoscopic @xmath9 metal films on @xmath1 in vacuum under multiple pulse irradiation with a laser of pulse length @xmath10 and wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "co nanoparticles are useful towards nanoscale magnetic applications and in catalysis .",
    "dewetting was studied as a function of film thickness @xmath4 , laser energy density @xmath12 and laser irradiation time expressed in terms of the number of pulses @xmath13 .",
    "we discovered that pattern formation evolved from cellular structures composed of polygons at early stages , which coalesced and eventually changed into nanoparticles at later times .",
    "every observed pattern was ordered with a characteristic length scale while the nanoparticles had a well - defined nearest - neighbour ( @xmath14 ) spacing @xmath2 and a monomodal size distribution with an average diameter @xmath3 .",
    "the observed variations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as function of @xmath4 were in agreement with the linear theory of spinodal dewetting .",
    "we also found that @xmath2 was _ independent _ of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , provided net @xmath9 evaporation was small .",
    "based on these observations we infer that once the pulsed laser melting initiated dewetting , subsequent pulses evolved this instability while maintaining its spatial characteristics , thereby leading to a predictable final state__. _ _ this offered strong evidence that the dewetting dynamics is extremely robust . _ to our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence for : ( i ) formation of metal nanoparticles with spatial order via a hydrodynamic dewetting instability ; ( ii ) evidence for the linear spinodal theory under multiple instances of phase change ; and ( iii ) evidence for robustness of the dewetting process to experimental conditions . _",
    "@xmath9 films with thickness @xmath15 to @xmath16 nm were deposited at rates varying between @xmath17 onto commercial optical quality @xmath18 wafers consisting of @xmath19 thick thermally grown oxide layer on polished @xmath20 wafers under high vacuum @xmath21 by e - beam evaporation at room temperature @xcite . for every film thickness we measured the surface roughness and average grain size .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) of the surface roughness established an upper limit of @xmath22 average rms roughness for the entire thickness range while transmission electron microscopy gave a average grain size of @xmath23 .",
    "no systematic change in roughness or particle size was detected with increasing film thickness .",
    "further , no spatially ordered defects or other heterogeneities were observed on the native substrate surface . for the film thickness range",
    "investigated the laser absorption at @xmath11 wavelength was uniform within the co film ( absorption depth @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore vertical temperature gradients could be neglected and the entire film temperature may be modeled as a uniform , time varying function that depends on the laser power ( source term ) and conduction of heat to the substrate ( sink term ) @xcite .",
    "the film thickness was measured by concentration measurements of co via energy dispersive x - ray spectrometry ( eds ) in a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",
    "the concentration was converted into an equivalent thickness value by using calibration based on step - height and rutherford backscattering measurements of the film thickness .",
    "the films were irradiated immediately after deposition in vacuum at normal incidence by an unfocused laser beam of area @xmath25 at a repetition rate of 50 hz . under these conditions ,",
    "the film surface was never exposed to air .",
    "hence no oxide layer was expected to form on the film surface .",
    "pattern formation was studied for energy densities @xmath12 between @xmath26 and for @xmath13 between 10 and 10,500 pulses . for each thickness",
    "the range of @xmath12 was chosen to be above the melt threshold .",
    "this was determined by a visible roughening of the metal film surface , as detected under high - resolution sem within the longest time scale of the experiment ( i.e. after @xmath27 laser pulses ) @xcite .",
    "analytical estimates based on a 1-d heat transport model as well as finite element simulations showed that the lifetime @xmath28 of the co liquid ranged from @xmath29 in the entire @xmath4 range studied @xcite .",
    "the same model predicted cooling rates of the order of @xmath30 and a total heating plus cooling time per pulse of @xmath31 , which was much smaller than the spacing between pulses of @xmath32 .",
    "hence , during each pulse , the film melts and in the molten state , dewetting process occurs . upon the cessation of the pulse , the film solidifies within a time scale much smaller than the interval between subsequent pulses .",
    "the maximum temperature of the molten liquid above the co melting point @xmath33 was estimated to be @xmath34 . under these conditions , the maximum evaporation observed after the longest @xmath13 at the highest @xmath12 was @xmath35 .",
    "[ cap : patternevolution ] shows the dewetting morphology observed for irradiation at @xmath36 of a @xmath37 thick co film for increasing number of laser pulses @xmath13 .",
    "this evolution sequence is typical of the ordered morphology observed in the thickness range of @xmath38 nm .",
    "after a few pulses , the dewetting morphology is characterized by a cellular network of polygons ( fig .",
    "[ cap : patternevolution]a ) . as @xmath13",
    "is increased the metal / substrate contact lines recede to the edge of the holes resulting in a network of coalescing polygonal features ( fig .",
    "[ cap : patternevolution]b ) . continued irradiation results in the formation of nanoparticles primarily at the junctions of the polygons , as evident from the location of the particles in fig .",
    "[ cap : patternevolution]b and in c and d. _ at every observed stage , a characteristic length scale @xmath39 was present , as evidenced by the annular form of the power spectrum of the spatial correlations in the intensity variation within each pattern .",
    "the power spectrum is shown alongside the corresponding images in fig .",
    "[ cap : patternevolution]a to d. _ for patterns consisting of polygons , @xmath39 represents the average distance between the center to the vertices , while in the case of the nanoparticles it represents the average @xmath14 spacing @xmath2 .",
    "a nonlinear peak fitting algorithm ( levenberg - marquardt ) was used to locate gaussian shaped peaks in the radial distribution function @xmath40 versus the wavenumber @xmath41 for each pattern ( fig .",

    "the variation of @xmath39 with @xmath13 for various @xmath12 values is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : timedependence]b ( _ the lines are only guides for the eye _ ) .",
    "the initial rapid increase in @xmath39 corresponds to the increase in the average size of the polygons .",
    "the decrease corresponds to the breakup of polygons into nanoparticles , with the long time value representing @xmath2 .",
    "the size distribution of nanoparticles in the final state was observed to be monomodal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : timedependence]c . also , as seen from fig .",
    "[ cap : timedependence]b , the value of @xmath2 remains unchanged over long irradiation times and is independent of laser energy @xmath12 .",

    "since the temporal scale used here is coarse , i.e. , it is expressed in number of pulses , the precise location of the peak value of @xmath39 was not detectable for every energy value .",
    "it is well accepted that dewetting morphology can progress via three pathways @xcite : ( i ) homogeneous nucleation and growth , where holes appear spontaneously at random locations and times on the surface . because of the inherent randomness , no characteristic length is present in this type of dewetting @xcite ; ( ii ) heterogeneous nucleation and growth due to defects , impurities or other experimentally imposed heterogeneities . in this type of dewetting",
    ", a characteristic length scale could appear at the early stages of dewetting due to ordered nucleation sites .",
    "for instance , in ion - irradiation induced dewetting , the average molten zone of an ion imposes a characteristic length scale in dewetting @xcite ; and ( iii ) thin film hydrodynamic ( t.f.h . )",
    "instabilities such as the one associated with the dewetting of spinodally unstable systems .",
    "the resulting patterns are characterized by a well - defined length scale in the hole spacing and/or size @xcite .",
    "since we have ruled out spatially ordered heterogeneities on the surface and in the film microstructure , the evidence for spatial ordering in fig .",
    "[ cap : patternevolution ] strongly suggests spinodal dewetting .",
    "we examined whether t.f.h .",
    "models developed based on lubrication analysis could help explain the time and length scales of the observed dewetting patterns . towards this end , we adopted the t.f.h .",
    "equations employed by vrij @xcite and sharma and ruckenstein @xcite to study spinodal dewetting in ultrathin polymeric films .",
    "lubrication theory provides a relationship between the mass flux ( which can be related to temporal variations in film height ) and the effective pressure gradient , which for a thin film could result from perturbations that produce interface curvature , and disjoining pressure due to long - range intermolecular forces such as van der waals interactions . for a thin film resting on a substrate contribution to the disjoining pressure",
    "can be expressed as @xmath46 where _ a _ is the hamaker constant and @xmath47 is the instantaneous film thickness .",
    "this approach leads to the dynamical equation describing the film height as a function of time as:@xmath48    where @xmath49 is the viscosity and @xmath50 is the interfacial energy of the film - vacuum interface and @xmath51 .",
    "if infinitesimally small perturbations @xmath52 are imposed on an initially flat film of uniform thickness _ h _ , i.e. _ _ _ _ @xmath53 , the growth / decay rate of such perturbations can be assessed by using linear stability analysis in which one keeps only terms which are linear in @xmath52 : @xmath54    substitution of the normal mode form @xmath55 , where _ x _ and _ y _ denote the orthogonal surface coordinates and @xmath56 represents the growth or decay rate of perturbations with the characteristic wavevector @xmath57 , into eq .",

    "[ eq : dispersion ] as:@xmath70 a previous investigation by bischof et al . using single shot ns pulsed laser melting of a multilayer metal structure",
    "has shown that is possible to capture snapshots of a dewetting instability provided the characteristic time scale of the dewetting process is much larger than the liquid melt time @xmath28 @xcite . based on our analytical model",
    "the liquid lifetimes were estimated to be @xmath71 for the range of experimental parameters reported here @xcite .",
    "further , using eq .",
    "[ eq : taud ] we estimated the dewetting time scale at the melting point @xmath72 of co using @xmath73 , viscosity @xmath74 , and a typical range of the _ hamaker _ constant @xmath75 for metals from @xmath76 .",
    "we found that the lower limit is @xmath77 for a @xmath78 thick film and this time increases rapidly with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that pulsed laser melting used in this experiment could capture snapshots of spinodal dewetting .",
    "we further suggest that once the dewetting instability is initiated , continued laser pulsing fosters the instability eventually leading to a robust final state whose length scale , as suggested by eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] , should be independent of the laser parameters .",
    "this effect is observed in fig .",
    "[ cap : timedependence]b , where despite a change in laser @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 , an identical @xmath14 spacing @xmath2 is observed in the stable nanoparticle state .    to provide further quantitative evidence for spinodal dewetting",
    ", we have investigated the experimental variation of the @xmath14 particle spacing @xmath2 with @xmath4 .",
    "the origin of the space - filling polygonal shapes can be explained by the presence of the preferred spinodal wavenumber @xmath79 , which is a scalar measure of the wavevectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the two orthogonal directions along the undisturbed planar film , defined as @xmath82 .",
    "since there are no external length scales in the @xmath83 and @xmath84 directions , one could have various combinations of @xmath80 and @xmath81 leading to the observed shapes @xcite .",
    "therefore the result of the linear spinodal theory ( eq . [ eq : lambda ] ) suggests that the polygon characteristics such as size , center - to - center spacings and the vertex separations will be proportional to @xmath85 . as we have shown from fig .",
    "[ cap : patternevolution ] , the observed nanoparticles form predominantly at the polygon vertices . therefore it is clear that if the nanoparticle spacing is a result of spinodal dewetting , then @xmath2 should be proportional to @xmath68 and also vary as @xmath85 . in fig .",
    "[ cap : timedependence](d ) , the experimentally observed variation of @xmath2 ( solid circles ) with @xmath4 is plotted .",
    "a power law fit to the variation in @xmath2 yields @xmath86 where the exponent of @xmath4 is in excellent agreement with the prediction of eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] of @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath14 spacing varied from @xmath88 to @xmath89 for the films studied . from the prefactor of @xmath90 ,",
    "the hamaker constant was estimated as @xmath91 ( assuming the proportionality factor correlating @xmath2 to @xmath68 is 1 ) .",
    "this value is of the right sign and order of magnitude for metals in general @xcite .",
    "we also evaluated the average diameter @xmath3 of the nanoparticles as a function of @xmath4 ( fig .",

    "[ cap : timedependence]d ) gave @xmath95 where the exponent is once again in good agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "_ these results clearly support a dewetting mechanism caused by a thin film hydrodynamic instability and also provides evidence that the linear spinodal theory is applicable under experimental conditions in which multiple cycles of film melting and solidification are present . _",
    "the break - up of the polygonal structures into droplets requires some elaboration .",
    "previous studies of break - up of cellular structures into particles have attributed the process to a rayleigh instability @xcite as a result of which the particle diameter will follow the trend @xmath96 @xcite . however , our interpretation of the experimental observations reported here is that particle formation occurs via progression of the spinodal dewetting instability and through capillary effects .",
    "the primary evidence that supports this interpretation is that the nanoparticles predominantly form at the junctions of the polygons , as compared to the classical string - like particle distribution resulting from the rayleigh instability of the polygon sides @xcite .",
    "capillary effects resulting from the difference in curvature of the spheroidal particles at the junctions and the polygon walls will also act to drive the liquid towards the junction , a situation that is relatively well understood from the classical problem of dragging of a liquid film by a moving plate @xcite .    for the spinodal process it is possible to rationalize why @xmath2 is invariant to laser energy @xmath12 despite the increase in the rate of dewetting @xmath97 , as observed from fig .",
    "[ cap : timedependence](b ) for early stages ( small values of @xmath13 ) .",
    "the increase in rate with increasing @xmath12 is due to two effects : one is the increase in liquid lifetime @xmath98 which will prolong the dewetting process within a given number of pulses ; the second is the increase in liquid temperature @xmath99 above @xmath100which will increase the rate as:@xmath101\\delta t\\ ] ]    where the hamaker constant was treated as t - independent based on its extremely weak t - dependence @xcite . since the the t - dependent material parameters for co of @xmath102 ; and @xmath103 both decrease with increasing t , therefore , the rate _ increases with increasing t _ , as qualitatively observed from the inset of fig .",
    "[ cap : timedependence](b ) .",
    "this increase will be reinforced by that produced by the longer melt lifetime__. _ _ a similar analysis shows that the dewetting length scales @xmath104 will decrease with increasing @xmath105 as :    @xmath106    this decrease in @xmath39 with increasing @xmath99 can be estimated to be @xmath107 for @xmath108 , which is a relatively small change and will be undetectable given the larger spread in the experimental values of @xmath2 of @xmath109 as measured from the @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , for conditions under which the net co evaporation is small , the changes in @xmath2 will be experimentally indistinguishable .",
    "in conclusion , we studied pattern evolution in nanoscopic co films @xmath110 under irradiation by multiple @xmath111 laser pulses .",
    "laser melting initiates a dewetting instability and subsequent irradiation fosters this dewetting to a stable state of spatially ordered nanoparticles .",
    "the dewetting instability appears to be spinodal in nature based on the observations of a characteristic length scale at all stages of dewetting and the @xmath112 behavior of the @xmath14 spacing of the nanoparticles . _ to our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence for : ( i ) formation of metal nanoparticles with spatial order via spinodal dewetting ; ( ii ) evidence for linear spinodal theory under multiple cycles of phase change ; and ( iii ) evidence for robustness of the dewetting process with respect to experimental conditions . _",
