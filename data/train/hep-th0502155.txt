    "in  @xcite , we presented a standard model within the context of the @xmath2 heterotic superstring .",
    "these vacua are @xmath3 supersymmetric and have the following properties .    *",
    "the observable sector has gauge group @xmath4 , _ three _ families of quarks and leptons , each with a _ right - handed neutrino _ , and _ two _ higgs - higgs conjugate pairs .",
    "there is _ no exotic matter_. in addition , there are 6 geometric moduli and a _ small number _ of vector bundle moduli . that is , the observable sector has exactly the spectrum of the mssm with one additional higgs - higgs conjugate pair .    within our context , the visible sector vector bundle is unique .",
    "all other bundles lead to an observable sector spectrum that is not realistic , having large numbers of exotic multiplets and higgs - higgs conjugate pairs .",
    "* the structure of the hidden sector depends on whether one considers the weakly or strongly coupled regime . in the strongly coupled context",
    ", we find a minimal hidden sector with gauge group @xmath5 , and _ no matter fields_. for weak coupling , one finds a minimal hidden sector with gauge group @xmath6 and _ two _ matter multiplets , each in the @xmath7 of @xmath8 . in both cases , there is a _ small number _ of vector bundle moduli .",
    "there is flexibility in choosing the hidden sector vector bundles since one can always perform small instanton transitions , see  @xcite .",
    "however , those leading to the minimal spectra just presented are , essentially , unique .    in  @xcite we presented the basic structure of the heterotic standard model , but only briefly outlined the requisite technical results .",
    "the properties of the smooth compactification manifold , calabi - yau threefolds with @xmath1 fundamental group , as well as the action of @xmath1 on the associated wilson lines were discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "however , the construction of the standard model vacua requires three other ingredients ; first , stable , holomorphic vector bundles with @xmath0 structure groups over this threefold , second , the cohomologies associated with these bundles and third , the explicit representations of @xmath1 on these cohomology groups .",
    "the low energy spectrum is then identified with the subspace invariant under the product of these representations with the action on the wilson lines . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss these three ingredients in more detail .",
    "this will establish the technical basis for our results in  @xcite and provide the context for assessing their uniqueness .",
    "the standard model vector bundles are _ not _ constructed from spectral covers  @xcite .",
    "rather , they are produced using a generalization of the method of `` bundle extensions '' introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the techniques for explicitly computing bundle cohomologies , and for finding the representations of a finite group on the cohomology groups , were presented  @xcite .",
    "standard model vacua require a significant extension of the methods discussed in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our computation of the spectrum as the invariant subspace under the action of @xmath1 on the cohomology groups and wilson lines represents an explicit method of `` doublet - triplet splitting '' @xcite .",
    "it is this technique which allows us to project out all exotic matter and to arrive at the minimal mssm spectrum with one additional pair of higgs - higgs conjugate fields .    in this paper , we present our computations and discuss the extensive search that led to the heterotic standard model .",
    "however , the full technical details will be left to future publications  @xcite .",
    "for example , the computation of vector bundle moduli is more involved than for other fields and will be presented elsewhere . in this paper , we simply point out that the @xmath1 projection greatly reduces the number of such moduli .",
    "we begin with the @xmath9 heterotic string compactified on a smooth calabi - yau threefold @xmath10 .",
    "this manifold admits stable , holomorphic vector bundles @xmath11 in the observable @xmath12 sector and @xmath13 in the @xmath14 hidden sector .",
    "gauge group of the hidden sector by denoting it with a prime . ]",
    "it follows that the four - dimensional effective theory will exhibit @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the mssm .",
    "it is well - established that neutrinos have a non - vanishing mass  @xcite .",
    "since the mssm has no exotic multiplets , @xmath3 supersymmetry will suppress any purely left - handed majorana neutrino mass to be too small by several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the mssm must be extended by adding a right - handed neutrino to each family of quarks / leptons .",
    "we would like to find a vacuum of the @xmath9 heterotic string whose observable sector is as close to this extended mssm as possible . to do this , it is useful to recall that each generation of quarks / leptons with a right - handed neutrino fits exactly into the @xmath15 spin representation of @xmath16 .",
    "it is compelling , therefore , to try to spontaneously break the @xmath17 gauge group of the observable sector to @xmath16 as already suggested in  @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished if we choose @xmath11 to have structure group @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 as desired .",
    "with respect to the maximal subgroup @xmath20 , the adjoint @xmath21 of @xmath12 decompose as @xmath22 the @xmath23 contain the gauginos of @xmath16 , the @xmath24 correspond to vector bundle moduli and the remaining representations are the matter fields .",
    "if @xmath10 is not simply connected , one can introduce , additionally , a wilson line @xmath25 to further reduce the gauge group .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that to break @xmath16 to a group containing the standard model gauge group @xmath26 , the simplest possibility is to require that @xmath10 have first fundamental group @xmath27 calabi - yau threefolds with this property were explicitly constructed in  @xcite .",
    "on such manifolds , one can choose wilson lines with the property that their holonomy group is @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath25 will then spontaneously break @xmath29 where , in addition to the standard model gauge group , there is a gauged @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "with respect to this low energy gauge group , the @xmath16 matter fields decompose as @xmath31 where we have displayed the quantum numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 for convenience .",
    "the @xmath34 decomposition is obtained by conjugation .",
    "we see from eq .   that the standard model fermions , including a right - handed neutrino , arise from the decomposition of the @xmath15 , as expected .",
    "similarly , higgs doublets occur in the @xmath35 of @xmath16 .",
    "note , however , that there may be extra , exotic matter multiplets in the spectrum .",
    "these include all fields arising from the decomposition of a @xmath34 .",
    "additionally , any of the color triplets in the decomposition of a @xmath35 are unobserved .",
    "therefore , if one is to be successful in finding a heterotic standard model , these exotic matter multiplets must be projected out .",
    "the above discussion implies that one must construct calabi - yau threefolds @xmath10 with fundamental group @xmath1 .",
    "this was carried out in detail in  @xcite . here",
    ", we simply outline those properties of the construction that are required for the analysis in this paper .",
    "the requisite calabi - yau threefolds , @xmath10 , are constructed as follows .",
    "we begin by considering a simply connected calabi - yau threefold , @xmath36 , which is an elliptic fibration over a rational elliptic surface , @xmath37 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that there are special @xmath37 surfaces which admit a @xmath1 action . furthermore , in a six - dimensional region of moduli space",
    ", @xmath36 admits an induced @xmath38 group action which is fixed point free .",
    "the quotient @xmath39 is a smooth calabi - yau threefold that is torus - fibered over a singular @xmath37 and has non - trivial fundamental group @xmath38 , as desired .",
    "specifically , @xmath36 is a fiber product @xmath40 of two @xmath37 special surfaces @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus , @xmath36 is elliptically fibered over both surfaces with the projections @xmath43 the surfaces @xmath41 and @xmath42 are themselves elliptically fibered over @xmath44 with maps @xmath45 the invariant homology ring of each special @xmath37 surface is generated by two @xmath1 invariant curve classes @xmath46 and @xmath47 with intersections @xmath48 using projections  , these can be lifted to divisor classes @xmath49 on @xmath36 satisfying the intersection relations @xmath50 these three classes generate the invariant homology ring of @xmath36 .",
    "for example , @xmath51 it follows that @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , one can show that @xmath53 .",
    "hence , @xmath10 has six geometric moduli ; three kahler moduli and three complex structure moduli .",
    "finally , the chern classes of @xmath36 can be shown to be @xmath54      next , we produce the requisite observable sector bundles @xmath11 on @xmath10 .",
    "this is accomplished by constructing stable , holomorphic vector bundles @xmath55 with structure group @xmath18 over @xmath36 that are equivariant under the action of @xmath38 . then @xmath56 .    the vector bundles @xmath55 are constructed using a generalization of the method of `` bundle extensions '' introduced in  @xcite . specifically , @xmath55 is the extension @xmath57 of two rank two bundles @xmath58 and @xmath59 on @xmath36 .",
    "these bundles are of the form @xmath60 for some line bundles @xmath61 on @xmath36 and rank 2 bundles @xmath62 on @xmath42 . the rank two bundles @xmath63 are themselves extensions @xmath64 where @xmath65 are integers and",
    "@xmath66 is the ideal sheaf of some @xmath67-tuple of points on @xmath42 .",
    "that is ,   gives us a prescription to build rank two bundles on @xmath42 ,   to produce two rank two bundles on @xmath36 and , finally , we use   to construct @xmath55 .",
    "one must specify not only the bundles @xmath55 , but their transformations under @xmath1 as well . to do this ,",
    "first notice that for the @xmath1 action on the space of extensions to be well - defined , the line bundles @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 must be equivariant under the finite group action . in this case , the space of extensions will carry a representation of @xmath1 .",
    "an equivariant rank four vector bundle will be any @xmath55 that does not transform under this action .",
    "a @xmath55 with this property will inherit an explicit equivariant structure from the action of @xmath1 on its constituent line bundles .",
    "having found such a @xmath55 , one can construct @xmath56 on @xmath10 , as required .    to proceed , therefore",
    ", one must consider the action of @xmath1 on line bundles and show how to construct line bundles that are equivariant .",
    "two natural one - dimensional representations of @xmath1 are defined by @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the generators of the two @xmath73 factors , @xmath74 are two group characters of @xmath1 and @xmath75 is a third root of unity .",
    "all other one - dimensional representations are products of   and , in any case , do not appear in our construction . note that none of these representations is faithful .",
    "let us consider an explicit example of a @xmath1 action on a line bundle . recall that @xmath76 is the trivial line bundle on @xmath36 .",
    "the simplest action of a group element @xmath77 on @xmath78 is by translation of @xmath79 to @xmath80 , with no action on @xmath81 .",
    "however , for any representation @xmath82 we can define a twisted action on @xmath78 by @xmath83 in this paper , we denote @xmath78 carrying this twisted action by @xmath84 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath84 is equivariant under @xmath1 , as desired .",
    "we may similarly define line bundles @xmath85 on @xmath36 , @xmath86 on @xmath87 and @xmath88 on @xmath44 .",
    "finally , having constructed equivariant holomorphic bundles @xmath55 with structure group @xmath18 over @xmath36 , one must ensure that they are stable .",
    "for an arbitrary holomorphic vector bundle @xmath89 , a complete proof of stability is extremely complicated .",
    "however , one can show that a bundle @xmath89 with vanishing first chern class is stable only if @xmath90 [ e3 ] we will use these criteria as highly non - trivial checks on the stability of @xmath55 , as well as on the hidden sector bundle @xmath91 .",
    "a method for computing the low - energy particle spectrum after compactification on @xmath10 with a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath11 and possible wilson line @xmath25 was presented in  @xcite and will be used in this paper .",
    "the spectrum is identified with the zero modes of the dirac operator on @xmath10 `` twisted '' by the bundle @xmath92 .",
    "the zero modes are the invariant elements of certain bundle cohomology groups . in this method ,",
    "one does not actually make use of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , all computations being performed on the covering space @xmath36 with bundle @xmath55 .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the observable sector discussed above . in this case , @xmath55 has structure group @xmath18 which breaks @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 admits a free @xmath1 action and @xmath55 is equivariant under this action .",
    "let @xmath93 be a representation of @xmath16 and denote the associated @xmath55 bundle by @xmath94 .",
    "one first constructs @xmath95 for all non - trivial bundles @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath94 is trivial , one considers @xmath96 which is always one - dimensional and carries the trivial representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the next step is to find the representation of @xmath97 on @xmath95 .",
    "choosing @xmath55 to be equivariant guarantees that these actions exit . finally , tensor each such representation with the action of the wilson line on @xmath93 .",
    "the zero mode spectrum is then the invariant subspace under this joint group action . in summary ,",
    "the particle spectrum is @xmath98 where the superscript indicates the @xmath1 invariant subspace .    although we have illustrated our method for the observable sector , it is completely general , applying to the hidden sector as well .",
    "it follows that the computation of cohomology groups , and the @xmath1 action on these groups , is a major ingredient of our construction .",
    "obtaining realistic particle physics in the observable sector requires the the following additional constraints on @xmath55 .    1 .",
    "three generations : : :    to ensure that there are three generations of quarks and leptons in    the low - energy spectrum , one must require that    @xmath99 using serre duality , and assuming    @xmath55 satisfies eq .",
    ", the    atiyah - singer index theorem implies    @xmath100 therefore , one must demand    @xmath101 or , equivalently , that    @xmath102 2 .",
    "no exotic matter in the observable sector : : :    the previous constraint ensures that there are precisely three chiral    generations descending from the    @xmath15 representations .",
    "however ,    there remains , in general , a large number of additional low energy    multiplets which descend from vector - like    @xmath103    pairs .",
    "these `` exotic multiplets '' are unobserved .",
    "therefore , we place    a very strong restriction on    @xmath55 and demand that there be    no exotic multiplets in its low - energy spectrum . referring to  ,",
    "we see    that the simplest way to ensure this is to require    @xmath104    to our knowledge , this has never been accomplished in any other    phenomenological string vacua .",
    "these typically have exotic multiplets    in vector - like pairs which , it is hoped , acquire heavy masses . in our    work , we constrain our spectrum to be as close to the mssm as    possible .",
    "small number of higgs doublets : : :    the number of @xmath35 zero modes is    given by    @xmath105 .    since the higgs fields arise from the decomposition of the    @xmath35 , we must not set the    associated cohomology to zero .",
    "rather , we restrict    @xmath55 so that    @xmath106 but non - vanishing .",
    "doublet - triplet splitting : : :    inspecting , we see that the decomposition of the    @xmath35 representation contains , in    addition to higgs fields , unwanted `` exotic '' color triplet    multiplets .",
    "we require , therefore , that    @xmath107    contain only the higgs - doublets    @xmath108 ,    thus projecting out the color triplets at low energy .",
    "this provides a    natural solution to the doublet - triplet splitting problem .",
    "note that    this mechanism is not confined to doublets / triplets .",
    "it applies to the    components of any multiplet , greatly reducing the spectrum after    taking the @xmath1 quotient .",
    "the vector bundle @xmath91 of the hidden sector must also obey the following constraint .",
    "anomaly cancellation : : :    for the theory to be consistent , one must require the cancellation of    all anomalies . through the green - schwarz mechanism , this requirement    relates the observable and hidden sector bundles , imposing the    constraint on the second chern classes that @xmath109= c_2\\big ( t{{\\ensuremath{\\widetilde{x}}}}\\big ) - c_2\\big ( { { \\ensuremath{\\widetilde{v}}}}\\big ) -        c_2\\big ( { { \\ensuremath{\\widetilde{v } } } } ' \\big)\\ ] ] be an effective    class . in the",

    "@xmath110 $ ] must vanish . in either case ,    @xmath111 and    @xmath112",
    "are fixed by    previous considerations .",
    "therefore ,   becomes a constraint on the    second chern class of @xmath91 .",
    "in this section , explicit bundles @xmath55 and @xmath91 satisfying the requisite data outlined above are constructed .",
    "we begin by considering the observable sector bundle .      after an extensive search",
    ", we found a unique solution for @xmath55 that is compatible with all of our constraints .",
    "it is constructed as follows .",
    "first consider the rank two bundles @xmath63 for @xmath113 on @xmath114 .",
    "take @xmath115 to be @xmath116 note that this is the trivial extension of   with @xmath117 .",
    "now let @xmath118 be an equivariant bundle in the extension space of @xmath119 where for the ideal sheaf @xmath120 of 9 points we take a generic @xmath1 orbit .",
    "second , choose the two line bundles @xmath70 for @xmath113 on @xmath36 to be @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively .",
    "then , the two rank 2 bundles @xmath123 defined in  eq .   are given by @xmath124 note that @xmath58 is of a special form , having no ideal sheaves and being itself the trivial extension , namely , a direct sum of two line bundles .",
    "the observable sector bundle @xmath55 is then defined as an equivariant element of the space of extensions  .",
    "we now show that @xmath55 , so - defined , satisfies all of the requisite constraints .",
    "let us begin with the three generation condition .",
    "computing the chern classes of @xmath55 , we find that @xmath125 note that @xmath126 , as required by the three generation condition  .    to count the number of exotic multiplets in the observable sector , it follows from   that one must compute @xmath127 .",
    "we find it more convenient to calculate @xmath128 and then use serre duality to find @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore , to discuss the stability of @xmath55 as well as the number of @xmath15 representations , we see from   and   that we need to know @xmath129 for @xmath130 as well . to do this , recall that @xmath55 is in the short exact bundle sequence  .",
    "this induces a long exact sequence involving the desired cohomology groups @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "these groups can be calculated if we can compute the adjacent terms in the long exact sequence , namely @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "this can indeed be accomplished using leray spectral sequences .",
    "exploiting the fact that @xmath36 is `` doubly '' elliptic , with @xmath136 in   projecting @xmath36 to @xmath137 and @xmath138 in   mapping @xmath137 to @xmath44 , the spectral sequence for any sheaf @xmath89 simplifies to @xmath139 and @xmath140 \\\\          & * + < 0mm>{\\strut}\\save [ ] * {         h^0(\\ip^1 , r^1\\b_{i*}\\pi_{i*}\\cf ) } \\restore \\ar[d ] &            & * + < 0mm>{\\strut}\\save [ ] * {         h^0(\\ip^1 , \\b_{i * } r^1\\pi_{i*}\\cf ) } \\restore \\ar@{=}[d ] \\\\      0 \\ar[r ] & h^1(b_i , \\pi_{i*}\\cf ) \\ar[d ] \\ar[r ]       & * + [ f]{h^1({{\\ensuremath{\\widetilde{x } } } } , \\cf ) } \\ar[r ]       & h^0(b_i , r^1\\pi_{i*}\\cf ) \\ar[r ]       & h^2(b_i,\\pi_{i*}\\cf ) \\ar[r ]       & \\cdots \\\\          & * + < 0mm>{\\strut}\\save [ ] * {         h^1(\\ip^1 , \\b_{i*}\\pi_{i*}\\cf ) } \\restore \\ar[d ] \\\\      & 0    } } \\ ] ] where we have boxed the term we wish to compute in . by @xmath141 and @xmath142 we mean the first higher images of the push - down maps @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively .",

    "additionally , there can be a wilson line @xmath216 on @xmath10 whose @xmath1 holonomy group is contained in @xmath217 .",
    "however , to allow for spontaneously breaking of the @xmath3 supersymmetry via gaugino condensation in the hidden sector , it is expedient to reduce @xmath217 as little as possible . with this in mind , we will choose @xmath216 to be trivial .",
    "as for @xmath11 , we construct @xmath13 by building stable , holomorphic vector bundles @xmath91 over @xmath36 which are equivariant under @xmath38 using the method of `` bundle extensions '' .",

    "instead , we find the following minimal solutions , depending on whether one works in the strongly or the weakly coupled regime of the heterotic string .",
    "the minimal vector bundle @xmath91 that is consistent with anomaly constraint   is found to have structure group @xmath218 .",

    "in addition to demanding that @xmath91 satisfy the stability conditions  , we require that there be no exotic matter in the hidden sector .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by imposing the constraint that @xmath227 the requisite @xmath218 bundle @xmath91 is any element of the space of extensions @xmath228 one can easily show that the entire cohomology ring vanishes .",
    "that is @xmath229 note that this result is consistent with the necessary conditions   that @xmath91 be stable .",

    "the five - brane wrapped on a holomorphic curve associated with @xmath110 $ ] contributes non - abelian gauge fields , but no matter fields , to the hidden sector .",
    "following the results in  @xcite , we find that the five - brane gauge group is @xmath230 .",
    "moving in the moduli space of the holomorphic curve , this group can be maximally broken to @xmath231 .",

    "applied to @xmath247 , we are unable to find a hidden sector bundle for which all exotic matter is absent",
    ".    however , relaxing the constraints so that a small amount of hidden exotic matter may exist , one finds the following minimal solution .",
    "it turns out that @xmath248 is the bundle @xmath91 introduced in eq .",

    "however , @xmath262 and @xmath263 do not vanish and may give rise to hidden sector exotic matter in the representations @xmath242 and @xmath243 respectively .    to analyze this , it is necessary to explicitly compute the action of @xmath1 on these cohomology spaces .",
    "this can be accomplished using methods similar to those discussed previously . here",
    ", we simply state the results .",
    "the action of @xmath1 on @xmath264 and @xmath265 is found to be @xmath266 and @xmath267 respectively .",
    "it follows from   that @xmath268 has no invariant subspace .",
    "since there is no wilson line in the hidden sector , all @xmath269 exotic matter fields are projected out of the low energy spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for @xmath265 .",
