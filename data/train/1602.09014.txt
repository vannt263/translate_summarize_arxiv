    "since the launch of the _ swift _ satellite in 2004 @xcite , hundreds of gamma - ray bursts ( grb , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) have been detected , localized and followed both on - board and by telescopes on the ground .",
    "this led to a very large sample of events presenting virtually all possible aspects of the standard model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a complete description of the model ) .",
    "several events have been followed in optical with rapid robotic telescopes while the prompt emission was still active or recently concluded , and in a fair number of cases a rising behavior has been observed in this band ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "this rise of the optical wavelength emission can be understood in two different ways : either it is the initial part of the forward shock , which can be observed until the injection frequency @xmath0 crosses the observational band , or we see the signature of the reverse shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "both phenomena can be interleaved , complicating the analysis .",
    "grb 141221a is one of these `` optically rising '' bursts .",
    "it was detected by _ swift _ at 08:07:10 ut ( hereafter @xmath1 ) on december 21 , 2014 @xcite .",
    "the duration of the burst , while not exceptional ( @xmath2 = 36.9 @xmath3 4.0 s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowed the tarot and skynet robotic observatories to start the observation while the prompt emission was still active . while in other cases the rise was smooth and not extreme ,",
    "in this case the optical emission increased very quickly and presented other features usually not seen ; the purpose of this work is to investigate those features .    in section [ sec_data ]",
    "we present the data for this event .",
    "we explain the data reduction in section [ sec_red ] , and present the spectral and temporal analyses in section [ sec_ana ] .",
    "we then discuss our results in section [ sec_discu ] , before concluding .    in the remainder of this paper ,",
    "all errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level ( except when otherwise stated ) , and we use a flat @xmath4cdm model for the universe , with @xmath5 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 = 0.3 and @xmath8 = 0.73 .",
    "we will use the standard notation @xmath9 .",
    "* _ swift_-bat and fermi gbm * : grb 141221a triggered both instruments @xcite , at nearly the same time ( 08:07:10 ut for swift , 08:07:11.22 ut for fermi ) .",
    "the recorded duration is , however , longer in the bat compared to gbm ( 23.8 s ) , as one can expect from the larger effective area ( and hence better sensitivity ) of bat/_swift_.    * _ swift_-xrt * : the xrt observed the burst position between @xmath1 + 64 s and @xmath1 + 34.9 ks @xcite , mostly in pc mode .",
    "the afterglow was clearly detected in x - rays .",
    "table [ table_1 ] presents a log of the observations and the data from the instruments that are used in this work . * _ swift_-uvot * : the observations started @xmath1 + 84 s @xcite .",
    "the afterglow is clearly detected .",
    "* tarot la silla * : the observations at tarot - la silla @xcite started at @xmath1 + 31.2 s and lasted for about 41 minutes , until the beginning of sunrise @xcite .",
    "the burst is not detected between 31 s and 68 s , with a limiting magnitude @xmath10 = 16.6 .",
    "after that time , the burst is clearly detected for the remainder of the observation .",
    "* skynet prompt - ctio * : the observations with skynet prompt - ctio ( two 14 \" telescopes ) , at cerro tololo , chile @xcite , started at @xmath1 + 45 s and lasted for 27.25 m @xcite .",
    "forty - four exposures were taken in the v and i bands , ranging from 5s to 160s .",
    "the optical afterglow was clearly detected with a rising light curve at t = 2 min and peaks at i = 14.8 .",
    "skynet observed the afterglow again at @xmath1 + 23.0 h for 1.5 h , taking 64 exposures of 160s each in v and i bands .    * grond * : grond @xcite observations started at @xmath11 @xcite , and continued for 18 minutes . the afterglow was clearly detected .    *",
    "keck ii telescope * : spectroscopic observations with the keck ii telescope were performed from @xmath1 + 1.78 h to @xmath1 + 2.15 h. several lines were detected ( mg ii doublet and fe ii ) , putting this burst at a redshift of z = 1.452 @xcite .",
    "the tarot data were reduced using the standard procedure already discussed in @xcite . we converted the observed signal from the clear filter to the r filter by calibrating the magnitude of the afterglow against nearby stars of similar color .",
    "subsets of the skynet images were stacked to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "calibration of these images was performed using three stars in the field from the aavso apass dr7 catalog .",
    "the bvgri magnitudes from apass were converted to bvri vega magnitudes using transformations provided by aavso ( a. hendon , private communication ) .",
    "standard bias , dark , and flat corrections were applied to all images .",
    "consecutive images were grouped and stacked in a way which maximizes the snr of the afterglow while minimizing the loss of temporal resolution .",
    "the afterglow and a single primary calibration star were photometered in each stacked image and the resulting calibration offset was recorded .",
    "a master calibration stack was then generated for each filter by combining all available images . for each master calibration stack ,",
    "the primary calibration star was photometered as well as the two secondary calibration stars . by comparing the offset obtained from the secondary calibration stars to that obtained from the primary calibration star ,",
    "a calibration correction is calculated and applied to all afterglow photometry .",
    "the remaining data have been gathered from the literature and are compiled in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the resulting light curves .",
    "all magnitudes were then converted into the ab system , if required . the correction for the galactic extinction",
    "was applied at the same time , using a value of e(b - v ) = 0.024 @xcite .",
    "the reddening due to the host galaxy is left as free parameter in fits to be discussed below .",
    "this leads to the corrections listed in table [ table_2 ] .",
    "we then computed from the corrected magnitudes the flux density , using a zero point value of 23.926 . the final flux density light curves are presented in fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    ".corrections to magnitudes due to galactic extinction .",
    "[ table_2 ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]            as can be seen , the addition of the optical data strongly constrains the spectral index of the power law to a very low value .",
    "on the other hand , from this fit we can not discriminate between a galactic or a large magellanic cloud law of extinction .",
    "we present the best fit sed ( assuming a power law model with an additional thermal component ) in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , using the lmc law , which is more common for grbs compared to the mw law @xcite .",
    "we first consider the possibility that the thermal component seen in the sed is real",
    ". this would not be the first time such a component has been observed in the swift era @xcite .",
    "it has been explained either as the shock breakout of the supernova onto the surface of the progenitor or the emission of a hot cocoon protecting the jet during its travel into the progenitor @xcite .",
    "we note incidentally that this last explanation was also proposed to describe the early emission of ultra - long grbs @xcite , even if , as in this case , the burst does not belong to that class of events .",
    "as no supernova has been reported for grb 141221a , we do favor the hypothesis of the hot cocoon .",
    "if this component is really present , then the sed indicates that the optical and x - ray emissions are linked together , and are thus due to the same emission mechanism .",
    "indeed , at late times , all the temporal decay indices are compatible , within errors .",
    "however , the sed is extracted before the final break of the i band , and thus this should also apply to earlier measurements .",
    "we do not see any evidence of a break in the x - ray light curve : this can be explained by the presence of the flare , which masks out the actual evolution of the afterglow .",
    "moreover , the break times of the i and v magnitudes are compatible , within errors .",
    "this light curve break is then achromatic , which is consistent with a jet break @xcite .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath12 which is extremely low .",
    "in addition , the jet break time is also extreme ( about 750 s , while a common pre - swift value is on the order of days * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this would lead to a jet opening angle of 1.3 degrees ( assuming the standard law of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and could explain why in most cases no jet break is observed for swift bursts : the break is looked for around a few hours ( or days ) after the trigger , and not at that earlier time .",
    "in addition to this surprising value of the jet opening angle ( that would put strong constraints on the sfr of massive stars in the universe ) , the only argument against this hypothesis is the r band behavior , that does not follow the v and i bands . in the previous section",
    ", we have explained this behavior by the fact that the break time was not identical in all bands .",
    "if we suppose a constant break time , we can not explain the r band behavior .",
    "let us now assume that the thermal component is not real , and instead use a broken power model for the sed . at a late time , all the temporal decay indices are compatible , within errors .",
    "now , the sed tells us that the x - ray and optical emissions are not linked to the same emission mechanism at the time of the sed ( 611 s ) .",
    "we can then assume that the various breaks we see are due to the passing through of a specific frequency into the observation bands , and that at a late time ( > about 1000 s ) , the crossing of this frequency has ended and all the emission is due to the same emission mechanism .",
    "the temporal break times in the i and v bands indicate that this specific frequency is decreasing with time , and , as already explained , the r band behavior is also compatible with that hypothesis .",
    "this leads us to exclude the passing through of the cooling frequency in a wind medium , as this frequency increases with time in such a case @xcite .",
    "if we still assume the wind medium , the only remaining option is the injection frequency , @xmath0 .",
    "however , the spectral index before the crossing ( @xmath13 ) would lead to a value of @xmath14 lower than 1 , which is not physical .",
    "we thus can conclude that these breaks can not be explained in the case of the wind medium .",
    "the situation is different in case of the ism .",
    "there , we can logically assume that the last two breaks are linked to the injection and cooling breaks , respectively .",
    "the injection and cooling frequencies vary as @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . taking into account the errors on the break times ,",
    "all break measurements are compatible with this explanation . after the cooling break , the spectral and the temporal decay indices are all compatible with a value of @xmath17 . the early spectral index ( before the cooling break , as measured in the optical ) should be @xmath18 , compatible with the measurement ( @xmath19 ) .    in this scenario ,",
    "the end of the `` pseudo - plateau '' phase is the injection break , i.e. , the peak of the afterglow .",
    "again , the variation of the break time between the v and i bands is consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "then , however , the temporal decay indices of the `` pseudo - plateau '' should become negative .",
    "this does not agree with the model .",
    "we explain it by the contribution of a small reverse shock that masks the peak of the emission .",
    "we can then , assuming the surrounding medium density to be equal to one , and the efficiency of the fireball in radiating its energy to be 30 % , compute the microphysical parameters of the fireball , using the work of @xcite .",
    "doing so , we obtain the fireball total energy ( @xmath20 erg ) , the magnetic parameter ( @xmath21 ) , and the electron parameter ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "these numbers are relatively normal ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , albeit @xmath23 is slightly higher than usually seen .",
    "we thus have a complete description of the afterglow of this burst .",
    "we note , however , the total absence of a stellar wind in that model .",
    "@xcite have pointed out the complex surrounding medium of a grb . however , assuming that the progenitor for all long grbs is a stellar object @xcite , we still should observe a small portion of the light curve where a wind environment should be present . here , from about 200 seconds after the trigger to the end of the observations , the medium is compatible with an ism only .",
    "it is a well - known fact that most of swift bursts are compatible with an ism , but a degeneracy prevents excluding the wind medium hypothesis @xcite . here , we have the proof that the wind medium is rejected from nearly the start of the afterglow , leaving only extreme constraints on the stellar physics in order to suppress the stellar wind from the progenitor .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to introduce such a stellar model , however grbs are known to have weak stellar winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus such a model would be very useful .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that the intrinsic values of @xmath24 and n@xmath25 are low , and thus again are compatible with a low density around this grb .      from our analysis",
    ", it turns out that we obtain a better solution using an lmc extinction law , because the observed grond g - band is best fit by 2175   absorption feature present in lmc ( and mw ) .",
    "we note that best - fit solutions with lmc or mw dust have already been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even if other models may be more appropriate @xcite .",
    "however , given that these data were obtained from the preliminary photometry quoted in @xcite , and that they do not have appreciable influence on the fitted parameter values , we prefer to leave this argument for a future work when better data will be available .",
    "all the spectral models we tried favor a slightly dusty environment with @xmath26 ( see table [ table5 ] ) .",
    "these values are not unusual @xcite , most of all at the distance of grb 141221a @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath27 is also in agreement with those found for other bright bursts , especially when compared with the best - fit optical extinction in the redshift interval @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "like many other bursts , the metals - to - dust ratio ( @xmath29 ) is in the range @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the extinction is not enough to set the optical to x - ray spectral index below the value @xmath31 ( see table [ table5 ] ) , and thus we can not consider grb 141221a as a dark grb @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the observations of grb 141221a made in optical and high energy bands by various instruments , including tarot and skynet . in x - ray bands ,",
    "the burst is very similar to all the previous ones observed , with a late flare . in optical bands",
    ", however , the light curve shows a rising part , a pseudo - plateau phase , and various temporal breaks .",
    "we explain these breaks as due to the passing through of several specific frequencies into the optical bands .",
    "we need a minimal contribution by a reverse shock to completely explain both the optical and x - ray light curves and spectra",
    ".    an alternative hypothesis would be the presence of a thermal component , to explain the observed optical / x - ray sed . in this case",
    ", the last temporal break observed would be due to a jet effect .",
    "this , however , would lead to various properties being , while not formally forbidden by the model , extreme , and , in addition , would lead to the presence of a thermal emission in the soft x - ray band .",
    "all of these facts are unusual and difficult to explain .",
    "clearly , both solutions are challenging for grb models . in the former case , all the data point toward an absence of stellar wind during the whole phenomenon , which is in contradiction with current models . in the latter case ,",
    "the microphysics parameters obtained by the model are very unusual , and in some cases not really taken into account by the model .",
    "grb 141221a should thus be added to the short list of very constraining bursts against which each new model should be tested .",
