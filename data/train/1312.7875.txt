    "the transverse momentum dependence of the gluon density arises from both perturbative and nonperturbative processes .",
    "the physical picture of dis scaling violation underlying this approach differs from that of finite - order perturbative qcd fits , e.g. at the nlo level , because it takes into account corrections to the collinear ordering in the initial state evolution to all orders in the qcd coupling @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", it also differs from bfkl evolution because it takes into account , for any @xmath0 , color coherence associated with soft multi - gluon emission . in this paper",
    "we have developed a parton branching monte carlo implementation of the ccfm evolution equation and we have included it in the ` herafitter ` program  @xcite .",
    "the choice of the kinematic range for the @xmath4 data considered in this paper is motivated by the fact that our approach relies on perturbative factorization theorems , which classify higher - order corrections according to logarithmic hierarchy based on high @xmath18 and low @xmath0 .",
    "however , we note that the choice made in this paper is conservative , and the physical picture lends itself to extensions to lower @xmath18 and higher @xmath0 . on one hand",

    ", it goes beyond bfkl by including large-@xmath0 terms according to the ccfm prescription .",
