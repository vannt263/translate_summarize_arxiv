    "the fragility parameter @xmath5 is obtained by fitting the autocorrelation data @xmath35 for laponite suspensions of different concentrations ( @xmath0 ) , added salt concentrations ( @xmath1 ) and temperatures ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath5 is approximately constant for the entire range of laponite concentrations and salt concentrations investigated here .",
    "these results are reminiscent of the observed independence of the isochoric fragilities of supercooled liquids on pressure .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 is independent of the screening effects of the repulsive interparticle interactions due to the addition of salt .",
    "finally , it is seen that @xmath2 determines the rate at which system approaches the glass transition ( or the apparent cooling rate ) and that @xmath5 is weakly dependent on @xmath2 .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the dependence of the kinetic fragility on the cooling rate for metallic glass formers @xcite . + the stretching exponent @xmath6 for laponite suspensions with different @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is seen to decrease linearly with waiting time , indicating a divergence of the width of the relaxation time distribution at even higher waiting times .",
    "this observation is similar to the decrease of @xmath6 with @xmath4 in many fragile molecular glass formers .",
    "we next define a timescale @xmath8 at which the width of the distribution of the slow relaxation timescale diverges .",
    "we report a correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath9 is the hypothetical vogel time at which the average slow relaxation time diverges .",
    "this correlation corroborates analogous observations in fragile molecular glass formers for which it was reported that the kauzmann and vogel temperature are approximately equal ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "we next calculate the ratio @xmath87 and plot it _",
    "vs. _ @xmath5 .",
    "this ratio is found be approximately 1 for all the @xmath5 values reported here .",
    "this observation is reminiscent of the change in the ratio @xmath89 with fragility parameter @xmath5 seen for several supercooled liquids @xcite . +",
    "our results therefore clearly agree very well with existing results for fragile glass formers .",
    "interestingly , in the case of laponite which is a colloidal system , @xmath8 is measured from the kinetics of the relaxation process and signifies the time at which the width of the distribution of structural relaxation times diverges .",
    "in contrast , @xmath21 for supercooled liquids is a thermodynamic quantity and generally calculated from calorimetric data .",
    "the correlation between the two hypothetical diverging time scales for laponite suspensions , @xmath114 , demonstrates that the average value and the width of the distribution of slow relaxation times diverge simultaneously .",
    "we explain this result using the coupling model proposed for molecular glass formers @xcite and the @xmath3-dependence of the stretching exponent @xmath6 observed in our experiments .",
