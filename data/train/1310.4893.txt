    "recently , a new type of cosmological transients , dubbed fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , was discovered @xcite .",
    "these radio bursts have a typical duration of several milli - seconds , high galactic latitudes , and anomalously high dispersion measure ( dm ) values corresponding to a cosmological redshift @xmath0 between 0.5 and 1 @xcite .",
    "the inferred total energy release is @xmath1 ergs , and the peak radio luminosity is @xmath2 .",
    "no detected electromagnetic counterpart was claimed to be associated with frbs .",
    "the physical nature of frbs is unknown .",
    "@xcite discussed several possibilities , and suggested that the event rate of frbs ( @xmath3 ) is much higher than those of of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and compact star mergers , but could be consistent with those of soft gamma - ray repeater giant flares or core - collapse supernovae . since the announcement of the discovery",
    ", several proposals have been made to interpret frbs , including delayed collapses of supra - massive neutron stars to black holes @xcite , special magnetar radio flares @xcite , mergers of double neutron stars @xcite , mergers of binary white dwarfs @xcite , and flaring stars @xcite .",
    "the milli - second duration @xmath4 points towards a small emission size for frbs : @xmath5 .",
    "the source of emission has to be limited to very compact objects involving neutron stars or black holes ( white dwarfs may be marginally accommodated , kashiyama et al .",
    "at such a small size , the brightness temperature of radio emission is extremely high , so the radiation mechanism must be coherent @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a good case that a supra - massive neutron star collapsing into a black hole would be a likely source of frbs .",
    "the supra - massive neutron star is initially sustained centrifugally by rapid rotation .",
    "as it gradually spins down , it would collapse into a black hole when centrifugal support no longer holds gravity .",
    "when the magnetic field `` hair '' is ejected as the event horizon swallows the neutron star , a strong electromagnetic signal in the radio band ( which they call a `` blitzar '' ) is released .",
    "this is an frb .",
    "@xcite suggested that such a delayed collapse would happen several - thousand to million years after the birth of the supra - massive neutron star .",
    "here we propose that a small fraction of such implosions could also happen shortly ( hundreds to thousands of seconds ) after the birth of the neutron star , and a signature of such implosions may have been observed in the early x - ray afterglow light curves of some grbs .",
    "grbs may originate from two types of progenitor : collapse of a massive star ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and coelescence of two neutron stars ( ns - ns merger ) or one neutron star and one black hole ( ns - bh merger ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a large angular momentum and a strong magnetic field are essential to launch a jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are two types of plausible central engine : one is a promptly formed black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which accretes materials from the remnant with an extremely - high accretion rate ( @xmath6 ) ; the other is a strongly magnetized ( with surface magnetic field @xmath7",
    "g ) neutron star which is spinning near the break - up limit ( millisecond rotation period ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our frb model invokes this latter central engine .    even without direct evidence ,",
    "a magnetar central engine is inferred indirectly for some grbs . a shallow decay phase ( or `` plateau '' ,",
    "fig.1 lower panel ) in the early x - ray afterglow of most long grbs may require continuous energy injection into the blastwave @xcite , which would be consistent with a spinning - down neutron star engine @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation does not invoke a long - lasting central engine , but invokes a stratification of the ejecta lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy between the two models was broken when the so - called `` internal plateaus '' were discovered in the early x - ray afterglow lightcurves of some grbs ( fig.1 upper panel ) @xcite .",
    "these are x - ray plateaus followed by an extremely steep decay , with decay index steeper than -3 , sometimes reaching -9 .",
    "by contrast , most `` normal '' plateaus are followed by a decay with a decay index around -1 , which is well consistent with the external shock model of grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review of the external shock model of grbs ) . the steepest decay allowed in the external shock model",
    "is defined by high - latitude emission of a relativistic ejecta ( e.g. when the blastwave enters a density void ) , which has a decay slope @xmath8 ( convention @xmath9 ) , which usually can not be smaller than -3 @xcite . the very steep decay following those internal plateaus",
    "therefore demands an internal dissipation mechanism ( rather than the external shock emission ) to account for the data ( and hence , the plateaus gain their name ) .",
    "this demands that the central engine lasts much longer than the burst duration .",
    "the essentially constant x - ray luminosity during the plateau requires a steady central engine output , and a spinning - down magnetar naturally accounts for the data .",
    "later a systematic analysis revealed more internal plateaus @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , such a signature was also found in a good fraction of short grbs @xcite .",
    "if one accepts that a millisecond magnetar is indeed operating in both long @xcite and short @xcite grbs , then the very steep decay at the end of internal plateaus suggests that the emission stops abruptly .",
    "it is difficult to turn off a rapidly spinning - down magnetar unless it collapses into a black hole .",
    "simulations show that a rapidly spinning neutron star can have a threshold mass ( for collapsing into a black hole ) that is larger by 30% - 70% ( depending on equation - of - state ) than the maximum mass of a non - rotating neutron star @xcite . as a result , in a large parameter space",
    ", it is possible that a proto- millisecond magnetar born with a baryon mass somewhat larger than the maximum mass of a non - rotating neutron star may undergo rapid spindown within @xmath10 s , and collapse into a black hole when it loses centrifugal support . the collapsing time may be near the dipole spindown time scale @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are moment of inertia , surface magnetic field at the pole , initial spin period at birth , and radius of the neutron star , respectively , and the convention @xmath16 has been adopted in cgs units .",
    "this can happen both in massive star core collapses @xcite and ns - ns mergers @xcite .",
    "as a supra - massive neutron star collapses into a black hole , magnetic `` hair '' has to be ejected based on the no - hair theorem of black hole .",
    "the strong magnetic fields in the magnetar magnetosphere would reconnect and get detached from the event horizon and expelled in a catastrophic manner .",
    "the total energy in the magnetic field can be estimated as ( @xmath17 is the light cylinder radius ) @xmath18 this is much larger than the observed energy of frbs .",
    "only a small amount of this energy is adequate to power an frb .",
    "the conversion of a small fraction of this energy to radio emission energy invokes a poorly known coherent radio emission mechanism , such as coherent curvature radiation through `` bunches '' @xcite or `` maser''-like amplifications of plasma modes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here we assume that a certain coherent mechanism can operate during the hair - ejection process , and the observed @xmath19 ghz radio wave can escape the emission region .",
    "it can reach the observer if it is not absorbed by the grb blastwave in front of the frb emission region .",
    "the comoving electron number density in the shocked ejecta region of the blastwave is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the wind luminosity of the grb , @xmath22 bulk lorentz factor , and @xmath23 the blastwave radius ) , which gives a comoving plasma frequency @xmath24 , much smaller than the radio wave frequency in the comoving frame @xmath25 hz . the density in the shocked circumburst medium region is even lower . so the frb emission can pass through the blastwave region and reach earth .",
    "overall , the magnetic bubble associated with this frb ejection , with total energy described by eq.([eb ] ) , would accelerate and convert the energy to the kinetic form .",
    "this energy is however small compared with the grb energy , so would not leave noticeable imprint in the grb afterglow light curve .",
    "_ since a sharp drop at the end of an `` internal x - ray plateau '' marks sudden cessation of the central engine , we suggest that the break time ( or shortly after ) is the epoch when an frb is emitted _",
    "( fig.1 ) .",
    "the observed frb event rate ( @xmath26 ) is almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than long grbs , which is @xmath27 at cosmological distances .",
    "so the scenario discussed above can not account for all frbs .",
    "_ only a small fraction of frbs could be associated with grbs . _",
    "also since not all grbs would have a supra - massive millisecond magnetar as the central engine , _ not all grbs would be associated with frbs_.    what is the nature of the majority of frbs ?",
    "we first consider the possibility that they are the same systems similar to grb - associated frbs but viewed at an off - jet angle . even though these events may marginally account for the event rate @xcite , the frbs ( even if generated ) are most likely not detectable . for massive star ( long ) grbs , it is believed that a more isotropic supernova should accompany the grb , which would screen any radio signal from the central engine .",
    "compact star ( short ) grbs may be more transparent .",
    "an internal x - ray plateau due to magnetar wind dissipation would have a near isotropic emission pattern , which could be observed without a short grb association @xcite .",
    "however , any frb emission would still be absorbed by the ejecta launched during the merger process , which has a mass at least @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at about 1000 s ( typical time at the end of internal plateaus )",
    "@xcite , this ejecta has traveled a distance @xmath29 cm . with a width @xmath30 cm",
    ", the mass density of the ejecta is @xmath31 .",
    "assuming an average atomic number @xmath32 for the ejecta , the electron number density is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ionization fraction .",
    "the plasma frequency is @xmath35 , which is @xmath36 for a reasonable ionization fraction @xmath34 .",
    "so the frb emission would be blocked by the ejecta .",
    "such an off - axis frb may be still observable if the ejecta has a `` filling '' factor less than unity , so that the frb emission can be visible at certain solid angles .",
    "nonetheless , this off - axis model can at most account for a small fraction of frbs not associated with grbs .",
    "this leaves the conclusion that most frbs are implosions with a much longer delay ( thousands to million of years , falcke & rezzolla , 2013 ) .",
    "the environment is clean .",
    "the frbs , once generated , can escape the source and reach earth .",
    "however , since the magnetic field strength is typically several times of @xmath37 g , the total energy of the explosion is smaller by 5 - 6 orders of magnitude than eq.([eb ] ) . this energy would be converted to kinetic energy of an outflow and then drives an `` afterglow '' of the frb . due to low baryon contamination",
    ", this outflow can reach a high lorentz factor .",
    "however , due to its low energetics , the afterglow would be too faint to be detectable . according to the synchrotron external shock model of grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the peak spectral density of the afterglow is directly proportional to the energy of the fireball , which can be scaled as @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the deceleration time is short , @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the characteristic synchrotron frequency is @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath41 is the total energy in the blastwave , @xmath42 is the ambient proton number density , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are fractions of the shocked energy that are distributed to electrons and magnetic fields , respectively , @xmath45 is the initial lorentz factor , @xmath46 is the observer time , and @xmath47 is the luminosity distance . even for a magnetar with a total energy budget @xmath48 erg ( eq.([eb ] ) ) , the peak flux density can only reach @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "the deceleration time is @xmath51 s , and the 1.3 ghz light curve reaches the peak ( @xmath52 ) at around 340 s after the frb .",
    "since the x - ray internal plateau was detected in a good fraction of short grbs , and since ns - ns merger has been regarded as a top candidate to power short grbs , our picture suggests that some frbs are also associated with gravitational wave bursts ( gwbs ) due to ns - ns mergers .",
    "our picture is different from totani ( 2013 ) , who suggested that all frbs are associated with ns - ns mergers . in his picture ,",
    "an frb is generated due to interaction of the magnetospheres of the two neutron stars , while in our picture , it happens 100s to 1000s seconds after the merger . as a result , the frb signal in our picture would be blocked by the ejecta launched during the merger in a large solid angle , so that the rate of frb / gwb associations in our picture is much less than that of totani ( 2013 ) .",
    "within the framework delineated in this paper , one would consider the following strategies to unveil the nature of frbs .",
    "since some grbs may have generated an frb @xmath53 s after the grb trigger , a prompt radio follow - up of grbs would be essential to verify or rule out our proposal .",
    "the fraction of long grbs that show an internal plateau is low , i.e. @xmath54 , @xcite .",
    "so the chance of catching an internal plateau would be low . however , an internal plateau is obervable only if the external shock emission is relatively weak ( fig.1 ) .",
    "many `` normal '' plateaus could be also related to magnetars , since their decay slopes and spectral indices are consistent with being due to energy injection of a millisecond magnetar @xcite .",
    "the end of plateau could be interpreted as the spindown time scale of a magnetar , some of which may be related to implosion .",
    "these normal plateaus would outshine the internal plateaus if the afterglow level is high .",
    "one would then expect that a fraction of normal plateaus would also be accompanied by frbs at the end of the plateaus ( or shortly after ) .",
    "the fraction of these magnetar - candidate normal plateaus can be up to @xmath55% of the long grb population @xcite . for short grbs",
    ", it seems that the chance of catching an internal plateau is much higher @xcite , although the end of plateau is earlier ( 100s of seconds ) . in the past ,",
    "radio follow up observations of grbs have been carried out much later , partially because of the technical challenge for rapid slew but also partially because of the lack of theoretical motivation ( the predicted radio afterglow peaks days to weeks after a grb trigger ) .",
    "the possible frb / grb connection proposed here hopefully would give more impetus for prompt radio follow - up of grbs .",
    "most frbs are not supposed to be associated with grbs .",
    "many of these will be discovered with future wide - field array searches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "broad - band follow - up observations of these frbs are encouraged .",
    "possible detections may be made if a small fraction of these frbs are associated with off - axis grbs , which may be possible for ns - ns mergers leaving behind broad - band ( afterglow and mergernova ) signals powered by a pre - collapsing magnetar @xcite . for most frbs",
    ", the afterglow would be too weak to detect , unless they are very nearby ( peak flux @xmath52 at @xmath50 for a magnetar ) .",
    "nearby short grbs with frbs would be accompanied by gwbs , both before the short grb ( in - spiral signal ) , between the short grb and the frb ( e.g. secular bar - mode instability of the supra - massive neutron star ) , and shortly after the frb ( ring - down ) .",
    "advanced ligo / virgo may be able to detect these signals if the source is close enough .",
    "some frbs may be also associated with gwbs without a short grb association , if the ejecta filling factor of ns - ns mergers is not too large .",
    "along the line of falcke & rezzolla ( 2013 ) who proposed that frbs can be produced when a supra - massive neutron star loses centrifugal support and collapses into a black hole , here we suggest that a small fraction of such implosions can happen shortly ( @xmath53 s ) after the formation of a supra - massive neutron star , which could produce an frb around an x - ray break time following some grbs , both long and short ( fig.1 ) .",
    "not all grbs could make frbs , but a good fraction could do . we therefore suggest a prompt radio follow - up observation for grbs , and suggest that observations as early as 100 s after grb triggers would be useful . if observations cover the period when the x - ray plateau ( both `` internal '' and `` normal '' , fig.1 ) is observed , a detection or non - detection of an frb at the end of the plateau ( or shortly after ) would greatly constrain the nature of frbs .",
    "most frbs are not supposed to be associated with grbs . in any case , some faint signals are predicted , and multi - wavelength follow - up observations of frbs may lead to detection of these signals under optimistic circumstances .    after posting the first version of this paper to arxiv ,",
    "i was informed ( 2013 , a. van der horst , private communication ) that the suggested frb / grb association may have been detected . in a conservative paper where the authors reported an upper limit of early radio afterglow flux , @xcite reported two frb - like events following two long grbs , at an epoch close to what is predicted in this paper .",
    "further dedicated observations are needed to unveil the rich grb / frb association phenomenology .",
    "i thank matthew bailes , alexander van der horst , peter mszros , kunihito ioka , kazumi kashiyama , dong lai , and feng yuan for helpful discussion and an anonymous referee for important remarks .",
