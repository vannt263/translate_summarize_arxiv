    "the spin-1 ising model with bilinear ( @xmath1 ) and biquadratic ( @xmath2 ) nearest - neighbor pair interactions and a single - ion potential ( @xmath3 ) is known as the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model @xcite . with vanishing biquadratic interactions ,",
    "the model is known as the blume - capel model @xcite .",
    "there is a large and diffused interest in the study of this model , motivated by several reasons .",
    "the beg model was originally introduced to describe the phase separation and superfluidity in the @xmath4he-@xmath5he mixtures , but it can also describe the properties of a variety of systems ranging from spin-1 magnets to liquid crystal mixtures , microemulsions , semiconductor alloys , to quote a few . both the beg and bc models",
    "have been investigated using many different approaches for different lattice type and dimensions . in one dimension and zero magnetic field , the spin-1 ising model and the beg model",
    "have been solved exactly by means of the transfer matrix method @xcite and by means of the bethe method @xcite .",
    "exact solutions have also been obtained for a bethe lattice @xcite and for the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice @xcite . for higher dimensions , among the various approximate and simulation techniques , the most common approach to the bc and beg models",
    "is based on the use of mean field approximation . however , renormalization group studies show some qualitative differences from the mean field results .",
    "the one - dimensional case for the beg model was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where exact renormalization - group recursion relations were derived , exhibiting tricritical and critical fixed points .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a rather broad list of works devoted to the study of the bc and beg models .",
    "in previous works @xcite , we have shown that , upon transforming to fermionic variables , spin systems can be conveniently studied by means of quantum field methods , namely : green s functions and equations of motion methods .",
    "this approach has the advantage of offering a general formulation for any dimension and to provide a rigorous determination of a complete set of eigenoperators of the hamiltonian and , correspondingly , of the set of elementary excitations . in this paper",
    "we apply this formulation to the 1@xmath6 beg model , and we obtain the exact solution of the model in the whole space of the parameters . postponing to a forthcoming work a comprehensive analysis of the model , in this article we focus our study on the thermal and magnetic properties of the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath7 ) spin-1 chain with single - ion anisotropy in the presence of an external magnetic field , in the limit of vanishing biquadratic interaction .",
    "this particular case is indeed interesting since one finds magnetization plateaus , experimentally observed @xcite . at @xmath8 the magnetization curve forms plateaus with abrupt jumps from one to another at certain values of the magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath10 , the ground state is purely antiferromagnetic for @xmath11 . by varying the magnetic field ,",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition to a pure ferromagnetic regime at @xmath12 .",
    "when the anisotropy @xmath3 is turned on , one observes an intermediate phase characterized by half of the spins oriented along the external field and the rest perpendicular to it .",
    "the intermediate phase between the anti- and ferromagnetic ones , has a width depending on @xmath3 whose endpoints are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , i.e. , critical and saturated field , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_ii ] , upon introducing a complete set of composite operators , eigenoperators of the hamiltonian , we outline the analysis leading to the algebra closure and to analytical expressions of the retarded green s functions ( gfs ) and correlation functions ( cfs ) .",
    "since the composite operators do not satisfy a canonical algebra , the gf and cf depend on a set of internal parameters , leading only to exact relations among the cfs .",
    "according to the scheme of the composite operator method @xcite , it is possible to determine these parameters by means of algebra constraints fixing the representation of the gf . by following this scheme , in section [ sec_iii ]",
    "we obtain extra equations closing the set of relations and allowing for an exact and complete solution of the 1@xmath6 beg model .",
    "section [ sec_iv ] is devoted to the study of the finite temperature properties .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec_v ] is devoted to our conclusions and final remarks , while the appendix reports some relevant computational details .",

    "the hamiltonian is pertinent to an hubbard model extended to include intersite interactions , namely : charge - charge ( @xmath29 ) , charge - double occupancy ( @xmath30 ) and double occupancy - double occupancy ( @xmath31 ) interactions .",
    "however , hamiltonian ( [ eq3 ] ) does not exactly corresponds to the beg hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) since the mapping between @xmath32 and @xmath33 should take into account the four possible values of the particle density ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
