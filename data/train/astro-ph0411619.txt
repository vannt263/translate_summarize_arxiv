    "recently , we have reinvestigated the cooling of neutron stars within a purely hadronic model @xcite , i.e. , suppressing the possibility of quark cores in neutron star interiors .",
    "we have demonstrated that the neutron star cooling data available by today can be well explained within the _ `` nuclear medium cooling scenario '' _ , cf .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , if one includes medium effects into consideration .",
    "this scenario puts a tight constraint to the density dependence of the asymmetry energy in the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the latter dependence is an important issue for the analysis of heavy ion collisions especially within the new cbm ( compressed baryon matter ) program to be realized at the future accelerator facility fair at gsi darmstadt .",
    "the density dependence of the asymmetry energy determines the proton fraction in neutron star matter and thus governs the onset of the very efficient direct urca ( du ) process .",
    "this process , once occurring , would lead to a very fast cooling of neutron stars . thereby ,",
    "if neutron stars with @xmath5 cooled slowly , the stars with the mass @xmath6 only slightly above @xmath7 would be already characterized by a very rapid cooling , yielding surface temperatures significantly below those given by the @xmath8-ray data points .",
    "unfortunately , the mass spectrum of cooling neutron stars is not known .",
    "one can not rely on neutron star mass measurements in binary radio pulsars ( brps ) with the averaged neutron star mass value @xmath9 @xcite because these objects come from a twice selected population : probably not all neutron stars go through the active radio - pulsar stage @xcite , and the properties of neutron stars in binaries may be different from those of isolated objects , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , it seems not a fair assumption that most of cooling neutron stars should be essentially lighter than the lower limit for brp masses @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the threshold for the du process should better occur at high enough densities such that typical neutron stars are not affected by it .",
    "this assumption about the mass distribution can be developed into a more quantitative test of cooling scenarios when these are combined with population synthesis models .",
    "the latter allow to obtain log n  log s distributions for nearby coolers which can be tested with data from the rosat catalogue @xcite .",
    "in addition the microscopically based argonne model for the eos , that is supposed to be the most realistic one @xcite , yields a critical mass for the du process @xmath11 . at these high star masses",
    "the central baryon density exceeds already the 5-fold of the nuclear saturation density such that exotic states of matter as , e.g. , hyperonic matter or quark matter are more appropriate .",
    "@xcite argued that the presence of quark matter in massive compact star cores is a most reliable hypothesis since within their model hyperons appear at sufficiently low densities and the equation of state becomes too soft to carry neutron star masses in the range of @xmath12 @xcite .    for quark matter in neutron stars , the interaction ( @xmath13 ) permits the quark du process .",
    "the works @xcite have shown that this result does not exclude the possibility that neutron stars might possess large quark matter cores .",
    "the suppression of the emissivity of the du process may arise due to the occurence of diquark pairing and thus color superconductivity in low - temperature quark matter . to demonstrate this possibility one has used the simplifying assumption that all quarks are gapped with the same gap which is not valid for superconducting phases at low densities . in the present paper",
    "we abandon that restriction and suggest a more subtle pairing pattern that is constrained by comparison with neutron star cooling phenomenology .",
    "the quark - quark interaction in the color anti - triplet channel is attractive driving the pairing with a large zero - temperature pairing gap @xmath14  mev for the quark chemical potential @xmath15  mev , cf .",
    "@xcite , for a review see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the attraction comes either from the one - gluon exchange , or from a non - perturbative 4-point interaction motivated by instantons @xcite , or from non - perturbative gluon propagators @xcite .",
    "various phases are possible .",
    "the so called 2-flavor color superconductivity ( 2sc ) phase allows for unpaired quarks of one color , say blue .",
    "there may also exist a color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite for not too large values of the dymanical strange quark mass or in other words for very large values of the baryon chemical potential @xcite , where the color superconductivity is complete in the sense that the diquark condensation produces a gap for quarks of all three colors and flavors .",
    "the value of the gap is of the same order of magnitude as that in the two - flavor case .",
    "there exist other attractive quark pairing channels .",
    "however the attraction is rather weak .",
    "one of these channels allows for a color spin locking ( csl ) , where all quarks are paired in a spin-1 channel .",
    "the weak pairing channels are characterized by gaps typically in the interval @xmath16 kev @xmath17mev .",
    "in describing the hadronic part of the hybrid star , as in @xcite , we exploit the argonne @xmath18 model of the eos given in @xcite , which is based on the most recent models for the nucleon - nucleon interaction with the inclusion of a parameterized three - body force and relativistic boost corrections .",
    "actually we continue to adopt an analytic parameterization of this model by heiselberg and hjorth - jensen @xcite , hereafter hhj , that smoothly incorporates causality at high densities .",
    "the hhj eos fits the symmetry energy to the original argonne @xmath19 model in the mentioned density interval yielding the threshold density for the du process @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the 2sc phase occurs at lower baryon densities than the cfl phase , see @xcite . for applications",
    "to compact stars the omission of the strange quark flavor is justified by the fact that chemical potentials in central parts of the stars do barely reach the threshold value at which the mass gap for strange quarks breaks down and they appear in the system @xcite .",
    "we will employ the eos of a nonlocal chiral quark model developed in @xcite for the case of neutron star constraints with a 2sc phase .",
    "it has been shown in that work that the gaussian formfactor ansatz leads to an early onset of the deconfinement transition and such a model is therefore suitable to discuss hybrid stars with large quark matter cores @xcite .    in some density interval above the onset of the first order phase transition",
    ", there may appear a mixed phase region , see @xcite .",
    "@xcite disregarded finite size effects , such as surface tension and charge screening .",
    "refs @xcite on the example of the hadron - quark mixed phase have demonstrated that finite size effects might play a crucial role substantially narrowing the region of the mixed phase or even forbidding its appearance in a hybrid star configuration .",
    "therefore we omit the possibility of the hadron - quark mixed phase in our model assuming that the quark phase arises by the maxwell construction . in this case",
    "we found a tiny density jump on the boundary from @xmath22 to * @xmath23 . *",
    "a large difference between chemical potentials of @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks forbids the pure 2sc phase , cf .",
    "the cfl phase is still not permitted at such densities .",
    "ignoring weak pairing patterns there could be two possibilities : either the quark matter is in the normal phase , or there appears a region of the 2sc  normal quark mixed phase . disregarding finite size effects , as in @xcite , refs .",
    "@xcite have argued for a broad region of the 2sc  normal quark mixed phase instead of a pure 2sc phase . in our model the mixed phase continues up to the central density @xmath24 .",
    "thus we have the mixed phase in the density interval : @xmath25 . in the given case the arguments of @xcite might be partially relaxed since the surface tension for the 2sc  normal quark boundary should be significantly smaller than for the quark  hadron boundary . indeed , as has been indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the surface tension is proportional to the difference of the energies of two phases , being proportional to @xmath26 in the given case .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite estimated the surface tension to be typically smaller than @xmath27  mev@xmath28@xmath29 for densities of our interest .",
    "for the choice of the gaussian formfactor the mixed phase appears for sufficiently low density @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . the presence or absence of the 2sc - normal quark mixed phase instead of only one of those phases",
    "is not so important for the hybrid star cooling problem since the latter is governed by processes involving either normal excitations or excitations with the smallest gap .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] we present the mass - radius relation for hybrid stars with hhj eos vs. gaussian nonlocal chiral quark separable model ( sm ) eos . configurations with the 2sc - normal quark mixed phase , `` hhj - sm with 2sc '' ( hhj hadronic eos together with gaussian nonlocal chiral quark model sm permitting 2sc - normal quark mixed phase ) given by the solid line , are stable , whereas without 2sc large gap color superconducting matter ( `` hhj - sm without 2sc '' ) no stable hybrid star configuration is possible . in the case `` hhj - sm with 2sc '' the maximum neutron star mass proves to be @xmath32 . for an illustration of the constraints on the mas - radius relation which can be derived from compact star observations we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] the compactness limits from the thermal emission of the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 as given in @xcite and from the redshifted absorption lines in the x - ray burst spectra of exo 0748 - 676 given in @xcite .",
    "these are , however , rather weak constraints .",
    "additionally , within the `` hhj - sm with 2sc '' mixed phase we will allow for the possibility of a weak pairing channel for all the quarks which were unpaired , with typical gaps @xmath33  kev @xmath34  mev , as in the case of the csl pairing channel , see @xcite .",
    "since we do nt know yet the exact pairing pattern for this case , we call this hypothetical phase `` 2sc+x '' . in such a way all the quarks get paired , some strongly in the 2sc channel and some weakly in the x channel .",
    "for the calculation of the cooling of the hadron part of the hybrid star we use the same model as in @xcite .",
    "the main processes are the medium modified urca ( mmu ) and the pair breaking and formation ( pbf ) processes . the hhj eos is adopted .",
    "below we choose two cooling models used in @xcite distinguished by different sets of the nucleon gaps . the first choice ( further model i ) is shown in fig . 2 ( fig .",
    "12 of ref .",
    "we use a fit for the relation between surface and crust temperatures ( called `` our fit '' in @xcite ) .",
    "we also made calculations for the other two crust models used in ref .",
    "although the results are affected by the choice of the crust model , our conclusions remain untouched .",
    "the possibilities of pion condensation and of other so called exotic processes are suppressed since in the model @xcite these processes may occur only for neutron star masses exceeding @xmath35 .",
    "the du process is irrelevant in this model up to very large neutron star mass @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 neutron and proton gaps are taken the same as those shown by thick lines in fig .",
    "we pay particular attention to the fact that the @xmath38 neutron gap is additionally suppressed by the factor @xmath39 compared to that shown in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite .",
    "the latter suppresion is motivated by the result of the recent work @xcite and is required to fit the cooling data . for the calculation of the cooling of the quark core in the hybrid star we use the model @xcite .",
    "we incorporate the most efficient processes : the quark direct urca ( qdu ) processes on unpaired quarks , the quark modified urca ( qmu ) , the quark bremsstrahlung ( qb ) , the electron bremsstrahlung ( eb ) , and the massive gluon - photon decay ( see @xcite ) . following @xcite",
    "we include the emissivity of the quark pair formation and breaking ( qpfb ) processes .",
    "the specific heat incorporates the quark contribution , the electron contribution and the massles and massive gluon - photon contributions .",
    "the heat conductivity contains quark , electron and gluon terms .",
    "we are basing on the picture presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - h ] and add the contribution of the quark core .",
    "for the gaussian formfactor the quark core occurs already for @xmath40 according to the model @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] . most of the relevant neutron star configurations ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cool - h ] ) are then affected by the presence of the quark core .",
    "first we check the possibility of the 2sc+ normal quark phases .",
    "[ fig : cool-2sc ] shows the cooling curves calculated with the given gaussian ansatz .",
    "the variation of the gaps for the strong pairing of quarks within the 2sc phase and the gluon - photon mass in the interval @xmath41mev only slightly affects the results .",
    "the main cooling process is the qdu process on normal quarks .",
    "we see that the presence of normal quarks entails too fast cooling .",
    "the data could be explained only if all the masses lie in a very narrow interval ( @xmath42 in our case ) . in case of the other two crust models the resulting picture is similar .",
    "the existence of only a very narrow mass interval in which the data can be fitted seems us unrealistic as by itself as from the point of view of the observation of the neutron stars in binary systems with different masses , e.g. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , cf .",
    "_ thus the data ca nt be satisfactorily explained . _    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl1 ] we permit the weak pairing pattern for all quarks which before in fig .",
    "3 were assumed to be unpaired .",
    "we use @xmath45mev for the corresponding quark gap .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl1 ] demonstrates too slow cooling .",
    "even slow cooling data are not explained . the same statement holds for all three crust models .",
    "thus the gaps for formerly unpaired quarks should be still smaller in order to obtain a satisfactory description of the cooling data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl003 ] we again allow for the weak pairing pattern of those quarks which were assumed to be unpaired in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool-2sc ] , but now we use @xmath46 kev for the corresponding residual quark pairing gap ( x ) .",
    "we see that all data points , except the vela , cta 1 and geminga , correspond to hybrid stars with masses in the narrow interval @xmath47 , very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool-2sc ] .",
    "this also seems to be unrealistic with the same argument as for the presence of unpaired quarks , see fig . 3 above .",
    "we have obtained a similar picture for the other two crust models .",
    "we have varied the constant @xmath48 in wide limits but the qualitative picture does not change .",
    "therefore we would like to explore whether a density - dependent x - gap could allow a description of the cooling data within a larger interval of compact star masses .",
    "we do nt choose the x - gap as a rising function of the chemical potential since the feature of such a model will not spread the accessible mass interval satisfying the cooling data constraint relative to the density independent x - gap case .",
    "we employ the ansatz @xmath49~,\\ ] ] where the parameters are chosen such that at the critical quark chemical potential @xmath50 mev for the onset of the deconfinement phase transition the x - gap has its maximal value of @xmath51 mev and at the highest attainable chemical potential @xmath52 mev , i.e. in the center of the maximum mass hybrid star configuration it falls to a value of the order of @xmath53 kev .",
    "we choose the value @xmath54 for which @xmath55 kev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl - x ] we show the resulting cooling curves for the ansatz ( [ gap ] ) .",
    "we observe that the mass interval for compact stars which obey the cooling data constraint ranges now from @xmath56 for slow coolers up to @xmath57 for fast coolers such as vela , cf . with that we have found with the purely hadronic model @xcite with different parameter choices .",
    "note that according to a recently suggested independent test of cooling models @xcite by comparing results of a corresponding population synthesis model with the log n - log s distribution of nearby isolated x - ray sources the cooling model i did not pass the test .",
    "thereby it would be interesting to see whether our quark model within the gap ansatz ( [ gap ] ) may pass the log n - log s test .    in @xcite different hadronic cooling models",
    "have been presented which can explain the available cooling data by varying the neutron star mass in some limits .",
    "the question arises whether one of these alternatives could be preferred . in ref .",
    "@xcite we conjectured that the model based on fig .",
    "20 of @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - h - tt ] of the given work ) that has used another choice of the gaps demonstrates the best fit since it shows a more regular dependence on the neutron star masses .",
    "we call it model ii . in this model",
    "ii the @xmath37 neutron gap is the same as in the model i used above , whereas the proton @xmath37 gap is calculated by @xcite ( see thin lines in fig . 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the neutron @xmath38 gap is taken from @xcite but then is additionally suppressed by factor @xmath39 as required by the result of @xcite and in order to appropriately fit the cooling data . according to @xcite this model ii succesfully passed the mentioned log n - log s test supporting the conjecture of @xcite and an earlier conjecture of @xcite that neutron star masses should be essentially different .",
    "we have performed the same hybrid cooling calculation as described above , now for the model ii .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same as those presented in figs [ fig : cool-2sc ]  [ fig : cool - csl - x ] .",
    "the difference is that now the curves related to low mass objects ( @xmath5 ) are pushed downwards describing the crab data point .",
    "however , as in model i , both scenarios either that there are unpaired quarks and that the x - gaps are density independent , do not allow to appropriately fit the data .",
    "the results for the density - dependent x - gap according to eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) now using the hadronic cooling model ii ( demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - h - tt ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl - x - tt ] . in comparison with the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl - x ] the variation of the cooling data between slow and fast coolers is obtained by choosing hybrid star masses in a wider range @xmath58 .",
    "next , it would be interesting to check whether this model passes the log n - log s test .",
    "concluding , we demonstrated that within a recently developed nonlocal , chiral quark model the critical densities for a phase transition to color superconducting quark matter can be low enough for these phases to occur in compact star configurations with masses below @xmath0 .",
    "for the choice of the gaussian formfactor the 2sc - normal quark matter mixed phase arises at @xmath59 .",
    "we have shown that without a residual pairing the 2sc quark matter phase could describe the cooling data only if compact stars had masses in a very narrow band around the critical mass for which the quark core can occur .",
    "since there are observations of neutron stars with higher and essentially different masses such a scenario should be disfavored .",
    "then we assumed that formally unpaired quarks can be paired with small gaps @xmath60mev ( 2sc+x pairing ) , which values we varied in wide limits .",
    "with density independent gaps we failed to appropriately fit the cooling data .",
    "we showed that the present day cooling data could be still explained by hybrid stars , however , when assuming a complex pairing pattern , where quarks are partly strongly paired within the 2sc channel , and partly weakly paired with gaps @xmath61mev , being rapidly decreasing with the increase of the density . within the given hypothesis and in the framefork of our quark model for the equation of state",
    "the observational data are explained in a broad mass interval @xmath62 for the model i and @xmath63 for the model ii , as it is favored by the experimental data .",
    "however we will point out that the result is model dependent and demonstrates only a possibility that the presence of the 2sc+x phase might not contradict to the neutron star cooling data .",
    "we have found rather strong constraints for the density dependent x - gap pairing .",
    "it remains to be investigated which microscopic pairing pattern could fulfill the constraints obtained in this work .",
    "another indirect check of the model could be the log n - log s test .",

    "<S> our equation of state ( eos ) allows for 2sc quark matter with a large quark gap @xmath1mev for @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks of two colors that coexists with normal quark matter within a mixed phase in the hybrid star interior . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that , if the phases with unpaired quarks were allowed , the corresponding hybrid stars would cool too fast . </S>",
    "<S> if they occured for @xmath4 , as it follows from our eos , one could not appropriately describe the neutron star cooling data existing by today . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a `` 2sc+x '' phase , as a possibility to have all quarks paired in two - flavor quark matter under neutron star constraints , where the x - gap is of the order of 10 kev - 1 mev . </S>",
    "<S> density independent gaps do not allow to fit the cooling data . </S>",
    "<S> only the presence of an x - gap that decreases with increase of the density could allow to appropriately fit the data in a similar compact star mass interval to that following from a purely hadronic model . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is suggested as an alternative explanation of the cooling data in the framework of a hybrid star model . </S>"
