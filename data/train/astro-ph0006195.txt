    "rapid variability , together with the non - thermal emission observed from radio to @xmath3rays , and very weak emission lines , are the main characteristics of bl lac objects .",
    "those objects are a subclass of blazars , and the most promising explanation for these characteristics is the scenario where the radiation is emitted by energetic electrons contained in a relativistic jet . this jet points close to the line of sight , and thus the radiation is beamed and doppler - boosted ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , many simultaneous multi - wavelength observations have been held , providing important tests for the emission mechanisms in blazars .",
    "the broadband spectra of blazars consist of two peaks , one in the radio to optical ",
    "uv range ( and in some cases , reaching to the x  ray band ) , and the other in the x  ray to @xmath3ray region . from the high polarization of the radio to optical emission",
    ", the lower energy peak is believed to be produced via the synchrotron process by relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the higher energy peak is believed to be due to compton upscattering by the same population of relativistic electrons .",
    "several possibilities exist for the source of the seed photons ; these can be the synchrotron photons internal to the jet ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , but also external , such as from the broad emission line clouds ( @xcite ) or from the accretion disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bl lac objects are often separated into two groups by whether the synchrotron peak frequency is in the uv  x  ray region ( hbls , or high - energy peaked bl lacs ) or ir  optical region ( lbls , or low - energy peaked bl lacs ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bl lacertae is the prototype object for the bl lac class , and thus is one of the best studied blazars ; it is an lbl .",
    "the active nucleus lies in a giant elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0.069 ( @xcite ) . while the optical and uv spectra of bl lac type objects are usually devoid of emission lines , the unusual aspect of of bl lacertae is the relatively recent appearance of optical emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , obscuring the boundary between quasars and bl lacs .",
    "other than the emission lines , lbls tend to have properties intermediate between quasars and hbls such as luminosities or frequencies where the peaks are located ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 1988 @xmath7 observation of bl lacertae showed that the x  ray spectrum of bl lacertae is relatively flat , with a photon index of 1.7 to 2.2 , and located above the extrapolation of the optical - uv continuum ( @xcite ) . in 1995",
    "it was observed with @xmath0 , showing the photon index @xmath8 = 1.94 @xmath9 0.04 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; it was also observed by @xmath10 , which showed @xmath8 of 1.94@xmath11 ( @xcite ) , and by @xmath12 , where the index was 1.68 @xmath9 0.18 ( @xcite ) . in 1995",
    ", the @xmath3ray emission above 100 mev was detected for the first time by the egret instrument onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory , or @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "bl lacertae was observed by @xmath0 following the report of a major outburst in 1997 discovered by optical observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such outbursts are particularly valuable for investigating correlations between different wavelengths , which led many observatories to point at bl lacertae .",
    "egret observations indicated that the flux level above 100 mev was 3.5 times higher than that observed in 1995 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was also detected in the 50  300 kev osse range ( @xcite ) , and 2  10 kev @xmath2 range ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "intra - day time variability was observed in the optical band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and in the x  ray band with @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "fits to the spectral energy distributions have been done by several authors , and interestingly , they all argue that the high energy emission detected from bl lacertae is likely to reveal comptonization of _ both _ internal ( synchrotron ) and external ( broad - line ) photons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper , we present and interpret the results of the @xmath0 observation of bl lacertae , together with the simultaneous @xmath2 observations . the observations are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe in detail the different variability patterns seen in the soft and hard x  ray bands ; in section 4 , we discuss the radiative processes responsible for the x  ray emission , and summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "we observed bl lacertae with @xmath0 during 1997 july 18.60  19.62 ut . the data were extracted by using the standard @xmath0 procedures for sis ( solid - state imaging spectrometer ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ; @xcite ) .",
    "gis was used in the ph - nominal mode , and sis was used in 1 ccd mode .",
    "source photons were extracted from a circular region centered at the target with 3@xmath14 and 6@xmath14 radii for sis and gis , respectively .",
    "the background data were taken from source - free regions in the same respective images . during the net exposure of 37 ks for sis and 60 ks for gis , the average count rates in the energy range of 0.7  7.0 kev were 0.47 count s@xmath6 , 0.41 count s@xmath6 , 0.33 count s@xmath6 , 0.43 count s@xmath6 , for sis0 , sis1 , gis2 , gis3 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 data were the same as presented in @xcite .    during the 1997 july outburst ,",
    "bl lacertae was monitored intensively in the optical , and in the high energy @xmath3rays by egret .",
    "comparing the optical and @xmath3ray light curves measured over the 10-day span shown in figure 2 of @xcite to the @xmath0 light curve shown in figure [ fig : lc ] , one can see that our 1-day observation occured exactly at the time of the correlated optical / @xmath3ray flare . in the the top and middle panels of figure [ fig : lc ] , we plot the soft ( 0.7  1.5 kev ) and hard ( 3  7 kev ) x  ray light curves .",
    "the x  ray flare  which occured close to the time of the optical and gev @xmath3ray flares  is strongly suggestive of a correlation of emission in the three wavebands . during the increase of the x  ray flux by a factor of nearly 4 ,",
    "the flux increased by a factor of 2.5 in the egret band ( 30 mev  30 gev ) , and a factor of 4 in the optical band ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we must note that the correlation ( and any lags ) can not be precisely measured because of the rather sparse sampling and limited sensitivity of egret ( but should be accomplished by the upcoming missions such as @xmath15 ) .",
    "most importantly , we discovered an apparent difference between the soft and hard x  ray variability , and this is well illustrated in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : lc ] , showing the time series of the calculated hardness ratio . in the soft x ",
    "ray band , we detected two rapid flares with the rise and decay times on the order of 2  3 hours .",
    "the hard x  ray flux also flared up , but with a somewhat smaller amplitude , and decreased with a longer time scale .",
    "this suggests that two separate emission processes may be responsible for the x  ray emission from this source .",
    "we also had two simultaneous @xmath2 observations , labeled as [ a ] and [ b ] in figure [ fig : lc ] , which extended our energy range up to 20 kev .",
    "the average 2  10 kev flux during the observation was @xmath16 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 , which is about 3 times higher than the previous @xmath0 observation in 1995 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we fitted the @xmath0 spectrum with a power law with absorption ( model wabs + pegpwrlw using xspec version 10.0 ) .",
    "we fixed the absorption at the the galactic value , @xmath17 atoms @xmath5 , which is a sum of gas columns measured in h and co as summarized in @xcite . here the @xmath0 data ( using 0.7  7.0 kev ) showed a significant excess below @xmath18 kev .",
    "the excess is also indicated from the low value of absorption when it was allowed to vary in the fitting process . on the other hand , the simultaneous @xmath2 data ( using 3 20 kev )",
    "are well fitted by the same model .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table [ tbl : avrg ] .",
    "we also found an indication of harder spectrum compared with previous observations in 1995 by @xmath0 ( @xmath8 = 1.94 @xmath9 0.04 ; @xcite ) and in 1988 by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 = 1.7 @xmath9 0.1 , 2.2 @xmath9 0.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "because the source was varying , we first selected two sets of spectra including the two pairs of @xmath2 and @xmath0 data sets , labeled as [ a ] and [ b ] in figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "note that one set was during a state of relatively low flux ( which is still higher than the 1995 value ) , and the other close to the maximum of the flaring state ; this provided two different flux states for a comparison of the spectra . as reported in @xcite , spectral variability (",
    "although at a modest level ) was seen among various segments of the @xmath2 observation .    before performing joint spectral fits to the @xmath0 and @xmath2 data , we selected the common energy range of 3  7 kev for both data sets to verify the consistency between the two instruments . in selecting the same time regions for @xmath0 , we extended the time intervals to 5 ks in order to collect a sufficient number of counts .",
    "we fitted both @xmath0 and @xmath2 data with a single power law plus galactic absorption model .",
    "for all the spectral fitting hereafter , we combined the data from 2 siss and 2 giss for the @xmath0 data , and the data from pcu 0 , 1 , and 2 for the pca data .",
    "the resulting best fits for region [ a ] and [ b ] for @xmath0 were : photon index @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with 3  7 kev flux @xmath21 = 1.1 @xmath9 0.1 and 1.67 @xmath9 0.09 @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 . for the @xmath2 data , they were : @xmath8 = 1.60 @xmath9 0.15 and 1.4 @xmath9 0.1 , @xmath21 = 1.28 @xmath9 0.04 and 1.95 @xmath9 0.04 @xmath22 10@xmath23 erg @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that the photon indices are consistent , but the flux inferred by the @xmath2 is larger by @xmath2410% .",
    "regarding this as an uncertainty of the calibration of two instruments , we added a multiplying parameter ( constant in xspec ) to account for the difference in the normalization .",
    "we fixed the value to 1 for @xmath0 , and allowed it to vary for @xmath2 .",
    "we fitted the 3  7 kev spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath2 together , and resulted with a normalization factor of @xmath2 to be 1.1 @xmath9 0.1 and 1.16 @xmath9 0.06 for regions [ a ] and [ b ] .",
    "we then fitted the full 0.7  20 kev combined data set with a single power law plus galactic absorption model , with the normalization of the pca data kept free .",
    "we found that although the single power law model provides an adequate fit to the low state spectrum [ a ] , it is rejected for the flaring state spectrum [ b ] at a confidence level of more than 99.9% .",
    "thus we fitted the spectrum [ b ] with an additional soft power law , where the fit improved to be acceptable .",
    "again , the normalization factors of @xmath2 were 1.08 @xmath9 0.06 and 1.14 @xmath9 0.05 for regions [ a ] and [ b ] , which is within the error bars of the values derived above . the fitting results to the combined data are summarized in table [ tbl : sum ] .",
    "the unfolded spectra of the two time regions [ a ] and [ b ] are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "it is apparent from that figure that a power law with a hard index is dominant in both spectra , which is consistent with the fact that bl lacertae is classified as an lbl ; in the context of the scenario described in the introduction , the main emission process in the x  ray band above @xmath18 kev is the inverse compton process .",
    "however , for the flaring state spectrum , we found that another soft spectral component , well - described as a steep power law , begins to dominate below @xmath18 kev .",
    "any detailed modeling of the source requires the knowledge of fluxes of the two spectral components _",
    "separately_. since both the @xmath25 kev and @xmath26 kev count rates are affected by both components and not just by the soft or hard component alone , we had to model the time - resolved spectrum to unravel the light curves of each component .",
    "this is particularly important since the combined @xmath0 and @xmath2 data revealed the soft component varying with larger amplitude at flaring states .",
    "we separated the entire observation into 9 time regions , labeled as ( 1 )  ( 9 ) in the top panel of figure [ fig : lc ] , and fitted the entire spectrum with a model including two power laws plus galactic absorption .",
    "since we found that the @xmath0 spectrum above 2 kev can be well fitted by a single power law plus galactic absorption model , we inferred that the spectrum above 2 kev is only modestly affected by the soft component .",
    "thus , we first fitted the @xmath0 data set above 2.5 kev with a single power law plus galactic absorption to determine the initial parameters of the hard power law . in the subsequent fitting of the full spectrum , we kept all four parameters of the two power laws free .",
    "all such spectra were well fitted by the two power law plus galactic absorption model .",
    "the index and the flux of each component are plotted in figure [ fig : index ] .",
    "we found that the soft power law is very steep with the photon index @xmath24 3  5 which appears to vary , while the hard power law has an index that varies little , between @xmath27 .",
    "the flux variability is a factor of 2 for the hard component , and a factor of 4 for the soft component .",
    "the derived fitting parameters are summarized in table [ tbl : each ] .",
    "the @xmath0 observation of bl lacertae showed that the flux is highly variable on a time scale of hours , and that the variability in the soft and hard x  ray bands appears significantly different , indicating that two different emission processes are responsible for the x ",
    "rays detected by @xmath0 .",
    "perhaps the most natural explanation of this behavior is where the high energy `` tail '' of the rapidly flaring synchrotron component is mixing into the less variable inverse compton spectrum .",
    "the very steep power law required in the soft spectrum in addition to the hard power law also supports this idea .",
    "the existence of the soft component was also suggested from the spectrum in the previous @xmath0 observation in 1995 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the reality of this soft component as intrinsic to bl lacertae  inferred on the basis of the excess of soft x",
    " ray flux  was somewhat uncertain , as it also could be interpreted by the overestimated value of the co absorption .",
    "our @xmath0 results of 1997 july are the first to confirm the existence of the soft component in bl lacertae not solely based on the photon spectrum , but on the different variability patterns of both components",
    ". this will be the third source following s5 0716 + 714 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and on  231 ( @xcite ) which reveals two components inferred on the basis of the difference in the variability patterns .",
    "we thus suggest that the soft power law dominating the soft x  ray band is the high energy tail of the synchrotron spectrum , representing its steep cutoff . because the synchrotron emission frequency is proportional to the square of the energy of the radiating electrons",
    ", we can regard the soft x ",
    "ray band as reflecting the most energetic electrons .",
    "the flat index of the hard component indicates that the hard x ",
    "rays are representing the onset of the inverse compton spectrum reflecting the lower energy end of the electron population , consistent with what we have known from previous observations .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of bl lacertae during the july 1997 outburst is shown in figure [ fig : multi ] ; this figure also illustrates the literature and archival data for pre-1997 observations .",
    "the two peaks common in blazar spectra are clearly seen , with the higher energy part of our combined @xmath0 and @xmath2 spectrum smoothly connecting to the @xmath3ray band observed by osse and egret .",
    "the upturn in the soft x ",
    "rays is evident , illustrating the synchrotron spectrum extending to the @xmath0 band .",
    "the x  ray light curve of bl lacertae shown in figure [ fig : lc ] reveals that the rapid flares are more prominent in the soft x ",
    "one possibility is that the flare is caused by the increase of the maximum energy of the electron population , similar to the flares observed in several hbls , such as from mrk  501 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , we must remark that bl lacertae also requires some other mechanism to account for the changes in the hard x  ray flux , which presumably forms the low energy end of the ssc spectrum .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is the increase of the normalization of the electron population , although variability of the magnetic field or the beaming factor is also possible .    rapid variability in blazars",
    "is generally assumed to be triggered by shocks propagating along a relativistic jet , and such a shock front is thought to be the most promising region where the electron acceleration may be taking place . the cutoff ( the maximum ) of the electron population is likely to result from the electron cooling time scale @xmath28 balancing the acceleration time scale @xmath29 in this region ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the photon spectrum also cuts off at a corresponding frequency , @xmath30 ( using the peak frequency of the synchrotron spectrum ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) , followed by a steeper decline . here",
    ", @xmath31 is the magnetic field in units of gauss , and @xmath32 is the lorentz factor of the maximum energy electrons . because the photon index of the soft component in our @xmath0 data was mainly steeper than 3 , the cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum most likely occurs at an energy lower than the @xmath0 band , @xmath24 0.1 kev or less . using 0.1 kev , we can calculate , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the magnetic field in units of gauss , and @xmath35 the beaming factor @xmath36 .",
    "we used @xmath37 g and @xmath38 inferred from the fits to the sed by @xcite and @xcite .    from the calculated maximum energy of the relativistic electrons ,",
    "we can now estimate the energy at which the overall spectrum cuts off . as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , assuming that the highest energy ( @xmath3ray ) range of the spectrum is produced by the compton mechanism via scattering of external photons from the broad line region , the overall spectrum should extend only up to the energy corresponding to these photons interacting with the most energetic electrons . if klein - nishina effects become important , the spectrum should also steepen above a certain energy . taking the typical energy of the broad line photons to be @xmath39 1.9 ev ( or wavelength @xmath24 6600  , the h@xmath40 line ) and @xmath41 = 10 , klein - nishina effects set in for electrons with lorentz factors exceeding @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the electron mass , and @xmath44 the velocity of light .",
    "this is slightly below the maximum lorentz factor inferred from the soft x ",
    "ray cutoff .",
    "thus the @xmath3ray spectrum should break above @xmath45 gev .",
    "the maximum attainable @xmath3ray energy corresponds to the maximum electron energy , @xmath46 gev .",
    "accordingly , bl lacertae is not likely to be a tev emitter , consistent with the observations showing only upper limits ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the `` tev blazars '' such as mrk  421 or mrk  501 , where the @xmath32 is thought to extend up to @xmath47 , and this high value of the maximum electron energy should be one of the main factors responsible for a blazar being a tev emitter .",
    "the decay time of the variability in the @xmath0 data for bl lacertae appears to be longer for hard x ",
    "rays  presumably produced by the low end of the distribution of electron energies  than for soft x  rays , produced by the most energetic electrons .",
    "this is reasonable given the fact that the electron cooling time is shorter for higher energy electrons ( @xmath48 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the energy density of the magnetic field , and the soft photons to be upscattered .",
    "as the scattering is expected to occur mainly in the thomson regime , @xmath51 can be estimated from the peak luminosity of the synchrotron ( @xmath52 ) and inverse compton ( @xmath53 ) components in the observed spectrum ( cf .",
    "[ fig : multi ] ) via @xmath54 . applying @xmath55 gauss and @xmath56 , the cooling time for the maximum energy electrons",
    "is calculated to be @xmath57 s , which is much shorter than the x  ray variability time scales of 2  3 hours that we have observed .",
    "this can be interpreted as resulting from the fact that time scales faster than the source light - crossing time @xmath58 , which is the time for the photons to propagate across the emission region , will always be smoothed out by @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    the soft x ",
    "ray light curve indicates that the rise and decay times are similar to each other .",
    "this is nicely consistent with the scenario where the soft x ",
    "ray band reflects the highest energy electrons , both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are shorter than the @xmath58 , and thus both rise and decay times are reflecting the @xmath58 . regarding the _ hard _ x  rays , in the context of the two - component comptonization model ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , those are produced by lower energy electrons , where the seed photons for the comptonized spectrum are probably the synchrotron photons in the optical band , at @xmath59 hz . with this , the 5  kev ( @xmath60 hz ) x  rays are produced by electrons with @xmath61 , and for those electrons , @xmath28 is about 40 hours .",
    "this is now significantly longer than the @xmath58 , estimated to be 2  3 hours , so those electrons are not expected to cool within @xmath58 .",
    "the long , gradual decay of the hard x ",
    "rays is then probably due to other causes , such as escape of particles from the radiating region , or decrease in the effective density of soft ( target ) photons .",
    "in contrast to the hard x  rays , adopting the above parameters  and assuming that the region producing the optical radiation is co - spatial with that producing the soft x  rays  we infer that the cooling times of the electrons producing the _ optical _ synchrotron photons ( which should have @xmath62 for @xmath63  ) are @xmath64 s , which , just as for the case of soft x  rays , is shorter than the source crossing time .",
    "this is supported by the very rapid variability of the optical flux with similar rise and decay times ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , similar to that seen in the soft x ",
    "ray band .",
    "however , we must also remark that we can not completely exclude the possibility of variability on a shorter time scale which we can not measure .",
    "the detected flares can actually consist of a superposition of more rapid undetectable flares , and there is actually a data point indicating a more rapid variability in the middle of the second flare , but the statistics do not let us distinguish such small flares .",
    "we expect future missions with larger effective area to provide sufficiently sensitive observations to completely resolve the most rapid events .",
    "@xmath0 x  ray observations of bl lacertae during the july 1997 outburst revealed that the x  ray flux was in a high state throughout the observation , in similarity to the optical and high energy @xmath3ray behavior .",
    "we detected two rapid flares with a time scale of 2  3 hours , but only in the soft x  ray band .",
    "the hard x  ray flux also increased , but decayed with a much longer time scale .",
    "the spectrum of the source in the highest flux states required two separate power law components , a soft and steep one , dominating below @xmath18 kev with a photon index of 3  5 , in addition to a hard component with a photon index 1.3  1.6 .",
    "this suggests that the soft component represents the high energy end of the synchrotron spectrum extending to the x  ray band , and thus allows us to estimate the position of the high energy cutoff of the synchrotron component , from which we infer the cutoff in the electron energy distribution to be @xmath65 .",
    "the cooling time scale of such electrons is @xmath24 350 s , short as compared to the variability time scale @xmath66 .",
    "we interpret this @xmath66 as the indicator of the source size .",
    "the slower decay time of the hard x  ray flux fits well into the scenario where the hard x ",
    "rays are produced via the comptonization of optical synchrotron photons by the lower energy end of the relativistic electron distribution ( where the cooling time scales are longer than the source crossing time ) . in this context , the long decay time in the hard x  ray flux is due to other causes , such as escape of particles from the radiating region , or decrease in the effective energy density of soft photons .",
