    "it is important to have a measure for anisotropy probe , which can exhibit different properties .    in principle , to determine whether underlying rough surface is anisotropic or not , following questions must be answered : first of all , what is the degree of anisotropy ?",
    ", what is the direction of anisotropy ? and finally , what is the kind of anisotropy ?",
    "@xcite . in the presence of anisotropy",
    ", one can divide the anisotropies into two categories : anisotropy in scaling exponents and / with in correlation length scale @xcite .",
    "the applicability of fractal properties and scaling concepts have been considered in @xcite , but if there is no scaling behavior represented by underlying surface , therefor one can not find reliable results by implementation of mentioned method based on scaling behavior .",
    "many given rough surfaces , even without any scaling properties , have also anisotropic nature and it is important to provide a robust and feasible algorithm for characterization of probable anisotropy .",
    "especially , in stochastic rough interfaces , the anisotropic features could be screened by the random nature of the surface , and it can induce additional and/or spurious properties .",
    "for instance , in the growth of anisotropic organic thin films , or erosion and growth with incident angle , anisotropic recognition and determining the kinds of anisotropies are of interest .    lateral ordering of nano - dots has been reported in many experiments @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the underlying order in the distribution of nano - dots is not directly observable without further analysis on the surface profile , such as fourier analysis with especial wavelet @xcite and curvelet analysis .",
    "also in cases , where nano - ripples form , the exact experimental parameters which lead to ripple formation can not be easily measured unless one is able to detect and track the formation of asymmetric ripples precisely .",
    "since usual methods to detect anisotropies , e.g. , fourier transform , have their numerical and technical limits , especially in situations , where having large number of samples to make a proper statistical ensemble not to be possible .",
    "however many researchers have tried to examine the anisotropic surfaces , but a little part of them has been devoted to give a quantitative measurements to quantify anisotropy @xcite .",

    ", there is an extensive work done by b. schmittmann et .",
    "a trivial and well - known approach is calculating the height - height correlation function and check whether the roughness exponent is directionally dependent or not ? . even though , previous researches give a good approach to find the direction of anisotropy , but only in some cases a method to discriminate between various natures of anisotropy has been established .    in this paper , by notion of anisotropic feature in surface erosion and self - affine rough surfaces , we introduce and apply crossing statistics as a benchmark of anisotropy measure .",

    "many researches have been done to examine @xmath10 and @xmath0dimensional stochastic processes from the level crossing point of view @xcite .",
    "some advantages of this approach are as follows : in many of previous researches with the same purpose , there is no well - defined approach to quantify the degree of probable anisotropy at different thresholds while in the crossing statistics method there is a systematic framework to examine anisotropic nature for various values of thresholds ( see section [ method ] ) .",
    "in addition , this method enables us to predict theoretical crossing statistics even in the presence of more complicated correlation function as well as probability density function of underlying fluctuation functions . in other words ,",
    "the non - gaussianity of underlying stochastic fields can be characterized by using this method , simultaneously . in the presence of isotropy and homogeneity , by calculating crossing statistics in @xmath10d",
