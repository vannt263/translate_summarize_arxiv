    "when a system exhibits a first - order transition at some set of parameter values , nucleation phenomena are observed in a transient process . a familiar example of such nucleation is observed in the liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the theory describing such nucleation was initiated by gibbs  @xcite , which was followed by quantitative arguments for the steady - state nucleation rate  @xcite .",
    "this nucleation theory was refined by zeldovich  @xcite and is now called the classical nucleation theory ( cnt )  @xcite .",
    "cnt was first constructed for droplet nuclei in a supersaturated vapor and then applied to bubble nuclei in a superheated liquid  @xcite . in cnt ,",
    "the nucleation is treated as a stochastic process , and cnt predicts a nucleation rate that corresponds to the emerging frequency of critical embryos .",
    "while nucleation rates during the homogeneous condensation of a supersaturated vapor are , on the whole , well predicted by cnt with some modifications  @xcite , it is well known that the nucleation rates of bubbles in a superheated liquid predicted by cnt are markedly different from the values obtained from experimentally  @xcite or numerically  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy originates from the fact that the nucleation phenomena of bubbles are considerably different from those of droplets for the following reasons .",
    "( i ) the free energy required to form a bubble is not a unique function of its volume or the number of particles since a gas is compressible .",
    "( ii ) work carried out by bubbles on the ambient liquid can not be ignored .",
    "( iii ) interbubble interactions via ambient liquid can not be ignored .",
    "one of the important differences between the droplet and bubble nucleation is the density of the ambient phase . for the case of the droplet - nucleation ,",
    "the ambient phase is gas phase which density is usually negligible .",
    "however , the bubbles can interact each other via ambient liquid .",
    "for example , one bubble growth increases the pressure of the surrounding liquid which may suppress the nuclei of other embryos .",
    "corresponding to ( i ) , the compressibility of bubbles can be measured by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite , and the free energy surface of the embryos of bubbles has recently been studied in terms of density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "the work carried out by bubbles can also be estimated directly by md  @xcite and indirectly by dft from the analysis of cavity  @xcite . despite such studies ,",
    "less attention has been paid to the finite - size effect on bubble - nucleation , while such effect was investigated for droplet - nucleation  @xcite .",
    "if the effect from ( iii ) is exhibited , this would cause strong finite - size effect .",
    "therefore , investigation of the size dependence of nucleation rates is necessary . in the present article ,",
    "we study bubble - nucleation processes of a lennard - jones liquid by md to clarify the finite - size effect of bubble nuclei .     and",

    "conversely , the sizes of bubbles before the explosive growth should be smaller than the critical size .",
    "the maximum volume of the bubbles in the region of fluctuation is estimated to be about @xmath52 .",

    "the additional relaxation time was also reported in droplet - nucleation  @xcite . while it was considered to be the time that the system needs to produce a nucleated cluster in droplet - nucleation , it can be a result due to the expansion , since the relaxation time does not exhibits the finite - size effect such as the temperature of the liquid under expansion as shown in fig .",

    "the value of the waiting time depends on the volume of the critical bubble where we choose @xmath67 for the nucleation threshold in this study",
    ". however , the value of @xmath12 should be independent of this definition since it is a parameter which depends only on the state of the superheated liquid . in order to confirm the above",
    ", we observe the waiting time with different values of the threshold @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
