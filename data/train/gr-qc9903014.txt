    "the problem of calculating the motion of an isolated body coupled to fields in curved spacetime is an old one which is currently receiving renewed interest .",
    "this recent interest is largely driven by the need for accurate calculations of processes which emit gravitational waves ( in anticipation of results from the new generation of gravitational wave detectors ) but similar issues arise for bodies coupled to electromagnetic and scalar fields . in order to describe in a simple manner those aspects of a body s motion which are independent of its detailed internal structure , one often attempts to calculate the motion of a `` point particle . ''",
    "a central problem in all such investigations is to calculate the effects of the particle s own fields , commonly referred to as `` self force '' or `` radiation reaction '' effects .",
    "this problem is mathematically ill posed since the fields diverge on the world line of the particle itself .",
    "nevertheless , there is a long history of attempts to calculate the self - force on a particle directly from the local fields .",
    "all such schemes involve some prescription for subtracting away the infinite contributions to the force due to the singular nature of the field on the particle s world line . in 1938 , dirac produced a force expression for a point charge coupled to an electromagnetic field in minkowski spacetime by imposing local energy conservation on a tube surrounding the particle s world line  @xcite .",
    "the infinite contributions to the force were subtracted through a `` mass renormalization '' scheme . in 1960 ,",
    "dewitt and brehme  @xcite generalized this approach to an arbitrary curved background spacetime .",
    "( a trivial calculational error in their paper was later corrected by hobbs  @xcite . ) more recently , mino et al .",
    "@xcite further adapted this approach to produce an expression for the self force on a massive particle coupled to linearized gravity on a vacuum background spacetime .",
    "recently , we also have derived  @xcite the formulas for the electromagnetic and gravitational self - forces by using an axiomatic approach which , in effect , regularizes the forces by comparing forces in different spacetimes .    despite the fact that it is thereby known , in principle , how to calculate the electromagnetic and gravitational self - force on a point particle ,",
    "serious difficulties arise in practice when one attempts to evaluate this self - force on account of the difficulties in computing the `` tail term '' contribution .",
    "indeed , the evaluation of the `` tail term '' is highly nontrivial even in the slow motion , weak field limit  @xcite .",
    "consequently , many researchers have employed the following iterative strategy for calculating the motion of point particles .",
    "first , one calculates the motion of the particle in the absence of self - force effects .",
    "then , the energy ( and/or angular momentum ) radiated to infinity by the resulting fields is calculated .",
    "finally , the effects of this energy ( and/or angular momentum ) loss are introduced as a perturbation to the particle s motion .",
    "note that the applicability of this approach is limited in that the energy and angular momentum of the particle are not even defined when the background spacetime fails , respectively , to be stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "in addition , even when the energy and/or angular momentum of the particle are well defined , the energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity would be expected to equal the energy and angular momentum loss by the particle only in a time averaged sense hence , the approach is , in essence , limited to calculating the secular decay of an otherwise stable orbit .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of spherical symmetry , the loss of energy and angular momentum in general is not sufficient to determine even this secular decay ( for example , it does not determine the variation of the carter constant for non - equatorial orbits in the kerr spacetime ) . finally , this approach does not allow one to calculate any so - called `` conservative forces '' ,",
    "i.e. , contributions to the self - force which are not associated with energy or angular momentum loss .",
    "nevertheless , this approach is extremely simple to apply and has been widely used to estimate the effects of radiation reaction on the motion of point particles .",
    "although the derivations of the self - force given in  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite were heuristically motivated by local conservation of energy , it is far from obvious , a priori , that they satisfy the property of `` global energy conservation '' as assumed in the iterative procedure described above .",
    "specifically , in order to justify the iterative procedure , it is necessary that the total energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity by the electromagnetic or gravitational fields be equal , respectively , to the net work and torque done by the self - force over the world line of the particle .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which this is the case .",
    "our main results are the following : in the electromagnetic case , we consider stationary , globally hyperbolic , asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "we assume that source - free maxwell fields satisfy a certain decay property , and that the advanced and retarded solutions with stationary sources have suitable fall - off at infinity .",
    "we then prove that if a point charge is asymptotically stationary in the past and future and in the same position , then the net electromagnetic energy radiated to infinity ( and/or into a black hole / white hole ) is equal to the integral over the particle s world line of the force expression given by dewitt and brehme ( as corrected by hobbs ) contracted with the timelike killing field .",
    "this provides some justification for the use of the above global energy conservation method to calculate the effects of radiation reaction .",
    "( alternatively , the fact that the dewitt - brehme force gives rise to global energy conservation may be viewed as providing further justification for its own validity . ) as byproduct of this theorem , we show that it is possible to consistently define the `` renormalized self - energy '' of a stationary point charge .",
    "we argue that a similar energy conservation result should also hold for a point charge which is in inertial motion near infinity in the asymptotic past and future .",
    "we also show that similar results hold for angular momentum conservation in axisymmetric spacetimes . as an additional byproduct of our analysis",
    ", we show that our conservation theorems also hold for the force expression used by galtsov  @xcite and others , in which the lorentz force associated with the advanced - minus - retarded `` radiative '' field is used .",
    "this result clarifies the relationship between the dewitt - brehme and galtsov formulas and demonstrates explicitly that global energy conservation alone is insufficient to determine the local force .",
    "our analysis of the gravitational case closely parallels that of the electromagnetic case , with the second - order einstein tensor  @xcite of the metric perturbation replacing the stress - energy tensor of the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , our analysis is hampered by a number of technical obstacles  such as the fact that the energy flux as calculated from the second order einstein tensor has been proven to agree with the bondi flux only for perturbations of compact spatial support  and its domain of applicability is limited to freely falling point masses ( since if the point mass is not freely falling , an additional stress - energy source for the metric perturbation must be present ) .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that energy and angular momentum conservation results analogous to the those in the electromagnetic case should hold for a point mass which is in geodesic motion near infinity in the asymptotic past and future .",
    "the electromagnetic case is analyzed in sec .",
    "we begin by proving energy conservation theorems for the case of smooth charge - current distributions in a spacetime with no black or white holes .",
    "the desired theorem for the case of point particle sources is then proven .",
    "generalizations to establish angular momentum conservation and to allow for the presence of black and white holes are then described .",
    "linearized gravitational perturbations are considered in sec .",
    "again , we begin by proving a conservation theorem for smooth stress - energy sources and then analyze the point particle case .    finally , for completeness",
    ", we present the analogous results for a scalar field in an appendix .",
    "our notation and conventions throughout the paper follow  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will state and prove our conservation theorems for the case of a maxwell field in a fixed background spacetime . for simplicity",
    ", we shall first consider conservation of energy in a stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime which contains no black or white holes .",
    "generalizations to other symmetries and to allow for the presence of black holes and white holes will be discussed at the end of this section .",
    "thus , until these generalizations are considered , we will restrict consideration to spacetimes satisfying the following conditions :    * spacetime assumptions * : _ let @xmath1 be a globally hyperbolic spacetime that is asymptotically flat at null and spatial infinity in the sense of ashtekar and hansen@xcite and is stationary in the sense that it possesses a killing field @xmath2 that is asymptotically a time translation at infinity .",
    "we further assume that no black holes or white holes are present in @xmath1 ( i.e. , the domain of outer communications is the entire spacetime ) and that there exists a smooth , spacelike cauchy surface , @xmath3 for @xmath1 such that in the unphysical spacetime @xmath4 , @xmath5 is compact .",
    "( this implies that @xmath3 is of the form of a disjoint union @xmath6 where @xmath7 has the topology of @xmath8 minus a closed ball and @xmath9 is compact . ) _    without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath10 everywhere on @xmath3 , where @xmath11 is the future directed normal to @xmath3 ( see proposition 4.1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "we now deform @xmath3 to the future in a small neighborhood of @xmath12 so that the deformed surface , @xmath13 , satisfies @xmath14 \\supset \\sigma'$ ] and , in the unphysical spacetime , @xmath13 remains a smooth , spacelike hypersurface , but now intersects @xmath15 in a cross - section @xmath16 .",

    "] we similarly deform @xmath3 to the past to construct a smooth , spacelike hypersurface @xmath20 such that @xmath21 \\supset \\sigma'$ ] and @xmath20 intersects @xmath22 in a cross - section @xmath23 . for all @xmath24 , we define @xmath25 to be the hypersurface obtained by `` time translating '' @xmath13 along the orbits of @xmath2 by @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , for all @xmath27 , we define @xmath28 to be the hypersurface obtained by `` time translating '' @xmath20 along the orbits of @xmath2 by @xmath29 .",
    "it then follows that for all @xmath30 and @xmath27 the surface @xmath31 \\cup { c}^-(t^- ) \\cup [ { { \\cal i}}^- \\cap j^+({\\cal s}^-(t^- ) ) ] \\cup i^0 $ ] bounds a compact region @xmath32 , of the unphysical spacetime , as illustrated in figure  [ unphysical ] .",
    "furthermore , it follows that any @xmath33 lies within @xmath32 for sufficiently large @xmath34 .    in a spacetime",
    "@xmath1 satisfying the above properties , we wish to consider solutions to maxwell s equations with source @xmath0 , @xmath35 } & = & 0 . \\label{maxwell}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows immediately from maxwell s equations that the stress - energy tensor @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 we define the stress - energy current three - form @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ( positively oriented ) volume element associated with the spacetime metric .",
    "we choose the orientation of all spacelike and null hypersurfaces to be given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is any future directed timelike vector field . then , the integral of @xmath38 over a spacelike hypersurface represents the total electromagnetic energy on that hypersurface , whereas the integral of @xmath38 over a null hypersurface represents the flux of electromagnetic energy through that hypersurface .",
    "equation ( [ tcons ] ) implies that @xmath43    initially , we shall consider smooth solutions to maxwell s equations with a smooth source @xmath0 , but later in this section we will consider solutions with point particle sources which are smooth away from the world line of the particle . in all cases",
    "we shall consider only solutions which satisfy the following three conditions :    * maxwell field assumptions * : _ ( 1 ) @xmath0 vanishes in a neighborhood of @xmath44 .",
    "( 2 ) the unphysical maxwell field @xmath45 continuously extends to @xmath15 and @xmath22 .

    "however , for a conformally invariant field such as @xmath53 , the energy current three - form is conformally invariant with conformal weight 0 , so condition ( 2 ) implies that the physical energy current three - form @xmath46 also continuously extends to @xmath15 and @xmath22 .    our fundamental result is simply a direct application of stokes theorem to the integral of eq .",
    "( [ jcons ] ) over the region @xmath32 . taking account of the absence of contributions from spatial infinity as a consequence of assumption ( 3 ) above ( i.e. , initially excluding from @xmath32 a coordinate ball of radius @xmath50 around @xmath12 and then letting @xmath48 ) , we obtain @xmath54 taking the limits as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we obtain our desired theorem for the case of smooth sources :    * theorem 2.1 * let @xmath1 satisfy the properties stated above and let @xmath53 be a smooth solution to maxwell s equations with smooth source @xmath0 which satisfies the three properties stated above .",
    "then , @xmath57 provided that each of the limits and integrals in the above formula exist .",
    "the above theorem has a straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "the first pair of terms on the left side can be interpreted as being the difference between the initial and final electromagnetic energy of the charge - current distribution .",
    "the second pair of terms is just the net electromagnetic energy radiated to infinity .",
    "finally , since @xmath58 is just the lorentz force acting on the charge distribution , the right side is the negative of the net work done by the electromagnetic field on the charge distribution , or , equivalently , it is the net work done by the charge distribution on the electromagnetic field .",
    "this , in turn , has the interpretation of representing the net amount of `` mechanical energy '' which is converted to electromagnetic energy .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ smoothem ] ) can be interpretated as stating that total energy is conserved .    unfortunately ,",
    "this theorem as stated does not have a direct counterpart for point particle sources .",
    "it is true that the net electromagnetic energy radiated to infinity is perfectly well defined in the limit of point particle sources .",
    "furthermore , although the integrand on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ smoothem ] ) becomes singular in the point particle limit , one might nevertheless hope that , in a suitable limiting process , the integral on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ smoothem ] ) would converge to @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the dewitt and brehme  @xcite expression for the electromagnetic self - force on the particle ( see eq .",
    "( [ dbforce ] ) below ) . however , the self - energy terms in eq .",
    "( [ smoothem ] ) become hopelessly divergent in the point particle limit , so , as it stands , eq .",
    "( [ smoothem ] ) will not make sense for point particles .",
    "nevertheless , we can proceed by considering cases where the self - energy terms in eq .",
    "( [ smoothem ] ) should cancel .",
    "in particular , this should occur if at sufficiently early times the charge - current source @xmath0 is stationary ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) , and at sufficiently late times , @xmath0 returns to the same stationary state , i.e. , if @xmath0 differs from a stationary distribution only in a compact spacetime region .",
    "however , even in this case , in order to ensure cancellation of the self - energy terms , it is necessary to assume suitable decay properties of source free solutions , as well as some properties of stationary solutions .",
    "it order to formulate our decay assumptions , we need to introduce a suitable norm , and it is most convenient to introduce this norm in terms of the unphysical variables . on the hypersurface @xmath13 , we decompose the unphysical electromagnetic field @xmath62 into its electric and magnetic parts with respect to the unphysical unit normal @xmath63 to @xmath13 , @xmath64 @xmath65 on @xmath13 , we define @xmath66 where the indices are raised and lowered with respect to the unphysical metric .",
    "note that for any @xmath53 which is nonsingular in the physical spacetime , we have @xmath67 provided only that @xmath68 continuously extends to @xmath15 , as we have assumed .",
    "note also that since the components of @xmath2 are bounded in an unphysical orthonormal frame associated with @xmath69 , it follows that everywhere on @xmath13 we have @xmath70 for some constant @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath13 has finite volume with respect to the unphysical metric , it follows that there exists a constant , @xmath72 , such that @xmath73 since the energy current 3-form is conformally invariant , this is equivalent to @xmath74 i.e. , the norm we have introduced on @xmath13 bounds the energy on @xmath13 .    in terms of the physical variables , we have @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are now defined with respect to the physical unit normal @xmath11 and indices are now raised and lowered with respect to the physical metric .",
    "we could similarly define a norm on @xmath25 by eqs .",
    "( [ norm1 ] ) or  ( [ norm2 ] ) , but this would not be useful on account of the possible `` time dependence '' of the conformal factor @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we instead define the function @xmath79 on @xmath25 by lie transport of @xmath78 along @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath86    it should be noted that although the definitions of @xmath87 and @xmath83 depend upon the choice of conformal factor , @xmath78 , on @xmath13 and @xmath20 , it is clear that satisfaction of the decay hypothesis does not depend upon this choice .",
    "furthermore , it is not difficult to verify that the satisfaction of the decay hypothesis does not depend upon the choices of @xmath13 and @xmath20",
    ". thus , the decay hypothesis is , indeed , a condition on the spacetime , @xmath85 .",
    "if the killing field @xmath2 is spacelike somewhere in @xmath88 ( i.e. , if an ergoregion is present ) , then solutions of the source - free maxwell equations with negative total energy can be constructed , and since only positive energy can be radiated to infinity , it is clear that the decay hypothesis can not hold ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we conjecture that the decay hypothesis holds for all spacetimes satisfying our spacetime assumptions in which @xmath2 is globally timelike .",
    "note that if @xmath85 satisfies the decay hypothesis , then there can exist at most one stationary solution to maxwell s equations with a stationary source @xmath0 which satisfies our maxwell field assumptions .",
    "( proof : if two such solutions existed , their difference would be a source - free solution which does not decay . ) for a stationary @xmath0 , both the advanced and retarded solutions are necessarily stationary . if @xmath0 is stationary and has compact spatial support on a cauchy surface , then condition ( 1 ) of the maxwell field assumptions automatically is satisfied .",
    "the final property we shall need is that the advanced and retarded solutions associated with such a @xmath0 satisfy conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as well :    * stationary solution property * : _ @xmath85 will be said to satisfy the _ stationary solution property _ if for any stationary @xmath0 of compact spatial support , the advanced and retarded solutions satisfy conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the maxwell field assumptions .",
    "_    it is readily verified that the stationary solution property holds for minkowski spacetime , and we believe that the stationary solution property holds for all spacetimes satisfying our spacetime assumptions . indeed , near infinity",
    ", the behavior of stationary , source free solutions is such that in order to prove that this property holds , we would , in essence , need only show that the advanced and retarded solutions for a stationary @xmath0 of compact spatial support do not blow up at spatial infinity . while this seems undoubtedly true",
    ", one would need some bounds on the long distance behavior of the advanced and retarded green s in a general spacetime satisfying our assumptions in order to obtain a proof .",
    "note that , in view of the above uniqueness property , if @xmath85 satisfies the decay hypothesis and the stationary solution property , then for any stationary @xmath0 of compact spatial support , the advanced and retarded solutions are equal .",
    "note also that for any stationary solution , the flux of energy through @xmath89 between @xmath12 and any cross - section @xmath90 ( or through @xmath91 between @xmath12 and any cross - section @xmath23 ) must either be zero or infinite .",
    "the latter possibility is ruled out by our maxwell field assumptions .",
    "thus , when the stationary solution property holds , the retarded (= advanced ) solution for any stationary @xmath0 of compact spatial support must have vanishing energy flux through @xmath89 and @xmath91 . from the form of the stress - energy tensor , it can be seen that this is equivalent to the vanishing of the pullback to @xmath89 ( or @xmath91 ) of @xmath92 , where @xmath69 denotes the normal to @xmath89 ; equivalently , we have on @xmath89 @xmath93 for some function @xmath94 on @xmath89 .",

    "although there should not be any difficulty in principle in allowing the background spacetime to possess suitable matter fields , in order to directly apply the results of  @xcite in the case of point particles , we must restrict to the case where the spacetime is vacuum at least in a neighborhood of the worldline of the particle .",
    "this restriction would still allow us to consider , for example , a fluid star solution in which the particle remains exterior to the star , but the inclusion of fluid or other matter fields would significantly complicate the analysis .",
