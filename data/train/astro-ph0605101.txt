    "the idea that the stellar halo of the milky way ( mw ) formed _ predominantly _ through the infall of smaller star systems  presumably dwarf galaxies  has a long history ( searle & zinn 1978 ) , strong observational evidence ( e.g. , majewski 1993 , majewski , munn & hawley 1996 ) , and currently a strong theoretical backing by way of hierarchical , @xmath3cdm models ( e.g. , bullock & johnston 2005 ; robertson et al . 2005 ; abadi et al .",
    "2006 ; font et al .",
    "but a longstanding puzzle in this picture is why , if they are the seeds of halo formation , do mw satellite galaxies have different stellar populations ( e.g. , unavane , wyse & gilmore 1996 ) and chemical abundance patterns ( e.g. , fulbright 2002 ; shetrone et al .",

    "2004 ; geisler et al .  2005 ) than typical mw halo stars ?",
    "one explanation ( majewski et al .",
    "2002 ; font et al .",
    "2006 ) is that prolonged tidal disruption will naturally lead to evolution in the types of stars a particular satellite contributes to a halo .",
    "indeed , it has become clear that abundance patterns ( e.g. , [ @xmath4/fe ] ) among the most metal - poor stars in dsphs  possibly the residue of a formerly much larger metal - poor population that may have been predominantly stripped from the satellites over their lifetime  do overlap those of halo stars of the same metallicity ( shetrone et al .",
    "2003 ; geisler et al .  2005",
    "; tolstoy 2005 ) .",
    "but the true connection of these ancient dsph stars with galactic halo stars remains speculative , or at least non - definitive .",
    "the sagittarius ( sgr ) dsph provides a striking example of a satellite galaxy being disrupted and slowly assimilated into the mw halo field population .",
    "it is the primary contributor of both carbon stars and m giants to the upper ( @xmath5 kpc ) halo ( ibata et al .",
    "2001 ; majewski et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter paper i ) and yields strong overdensity signatures of msto and rr lyrae stars at halo distances ( newberg et al .  2002 ; vivas , zinn & gallart 2005 ) .",
    "yet the current metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of the sgr core , with median [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ( fig .  7 ) , is quite unlike that of the galactic halo ( median [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) and thus the sgr system would seem to present one of the most dramatic examples of the apparent dsph / halo star abundance dichotomy . in this paper",
    "we explore the possible origins of this dichotomy by making high resolution , spectroscopic observations of stars not only known to have been contributed to the milky way halo from a _ specific _ dsph satellite , but also _",
    "when_. in the case of the sgr dsph we show that the origin of the abundance dichotomy with the galactic halo arises from preferential tidal stripping of metal poor stars , which leads to divergent mdfs between lost and retained sgr stars , as well as a significant variation in the sgr mdf along its tidal tails from the core to debris lost from the core several gyr ago .",
    "initial photometric estimates indicated that sgr is largely dominated by a population of old to intermediate age stars ( bellazzini et al .  1999 ; layden & sarajedini 2000 ) , but with an mdf spanning from [ fe / h ] @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( see also cacciari , bellazzini & colucci 2002 ) .",
    "however , a more metal - rich population with [ fe / h ] @xmath9 was found with high resolution spectra ( bonifacio et al .",
    "2000 , 2004 ; smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2002 ; monaco et al .",
    "2005 ) as well as in a recent , deep color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) from the hubble space telescope acs centered on m54 ( siegel et al .",
    "these chemical abundance studies thus present a sgr mdf dominated by a metal - rich population with median [ fe / h ] @xmath0 , but having a metal - weak tail extending to [ fe / h ] @xmath7 ( smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2002 ; zaggia et al .",
    "2004 ; monaco et al .",
    "monaco et al.(2003 ) and cole et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have found sgr to have a similar mdf to the lmc ( which has a dominant population of median [ fe / h]@xmath10 ) with a similar fraction of metal - poor stars , which suggests that sgr may have had a progenitor resembling the lmc ( monaco et al .",
    "in a recent reanalysis of the age - metallicity relationship in sgr , bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that the dsph may have enriched to near - solar metallicity as early as 6 gyr ago , though a more recent analysis by siegel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggests a somewhat slower evolution to this enrichment level .",
    "thus far , abundance studies of the sgr tails have been less detailed .",
    "dohm - palmer et al .  ( 2001 ) obtained spectra of some k giants apparently in the northern leading arm ( near its apogalacticon ) and inferred the stream there was about a half dex more metal poor than the sgr core ; these authors suggested that the sgr dsph may originally have had a strong metallicity gradient .",
    "alard ( 2001 ) noted differences in the sgr giant branch position in the @xmath11 cmd between the sgr center and a field @xmath12 down its major axis implying a @xmath13 dex metallicity variation between these two points ( see  7 ) .",
    "paper i also suggested the possibility of a metallicity variation along the sgr tidal arms because giant stars in the arms with different @xmath14 colors seemed to yield different photometric parallax distances for the stream when the color - magnitude relation of the sgr core was used for all colors ; the differences could be explained by varying mean rgb slopes along the stream ( see figure 14 and footnote 14 of paper i ) . adding information derived from isochrone - fitting to main sequence turnoff stars , martnez - delgado et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that there is a substantial metallicity gradient along the sgr stream .",
    "vivas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained a mean [ fe / h ] @xmath15 from low / medium resolution spectra of sixteen rr lyrae stars in the sgr leading arm ; but since only the oldest and hence metal - poor populations in sgr would produce rr lyrae , this age - biased sample can not be used to infer information on the full extent of the stream mdf . on the other hand , bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found significant differences in the relative numbers of blue horizontal branch to red clump stars between the sgr core and a position about 75@xmath16 forward along the sgr leading arm , an imbalance that suggests a significant metallicity variation along the sgr stream .",
    "thus , while compelling evidence has been gathering for metallicity variations along the sgr stream , no _ direct _ measurement of this variation has been made by sampling with high resolution spectroscopy the actual [ fe / h ] distributions of constituent stars .",
    "we have begun a systematic survey of the chemical abundance patterns of stars in the sgr stream .",
    "the goal of the present contribution is a first systematic exploration of the mdf along the sgr stream ; future work will focus on chemical abundance _ patterns _ in sgr stream stars .",
    "the design of our study , and in particular the rationale for the specific stars targeted for observation , has been driven by several practical considerations .",
    "first , because information on potential _ variations _ in metallicity along the stream is sought , multiple portions of the sgr stream representing different dynamical ages ( i.e. the times when the debris was stripped ) is needed .",
    "second , because the sgr core itself exhibits a metallicity _ spread _ , insufficient information is gained by only sampling a few stars at any particular part of the tail ; rather , exploration of _ distributions _ in metallicity is needed .",
    "this requires reasonable numbers of stars at each sampled section of the stream . with a limited amount of telescope time",
    "it is easier to build large samples with brighter targets , but , even focusing purely on the intrinsically brightest stars identified in the stream  the m giants explored , e.g. , in paper i and majewski et al .",
    "( 2004 , `` paper ii '' hereafter ) , this is still a challenging project if spectra at echelle resolution are needed .",
    "the difficulty of securing large samples of stars partly motivated our strategy in this first study of sgr debris stars to explore the sgr leading arm  which passes quite near the solar neighborhood ( paper i ) .",
    "in contrast , the sgr trailing arm , in its most clearly discernible parts in the southern galactic hemisphere , never gets closer than @xmath215 kpc to the sun . by observing the leading arm both just above and just below the galactic plane",
    "we access two different points along this tidal stream with fairly local stars bright enough to take maximal advantage of our particular instrument access ( two echelle spectrographs on 4-m class telescope in the northern hemisphere and only about one night per year on an echelle spectrograph in the southern hemisphere ) .",
    "this strategy for exploring the leading arm , however , has some drawbacks in that ( 1 ) the trailing arm is dynamically much better understood than the leading arm ( helmi 2004 ; law , johnston & majewski 2005 , hereafter `` paper iv '' ) , ( 2 ) the sorting of stars by dynamical age is much cleaner in the trailing arm than the leading arm ( paper iv ; see also  7 ) , ( 3 ) major sections of the leading arm are very much farther away ( @xmath17 kpc )  out of range of our accessible instrumentation and requiring 10-m telescopes should we ever desire to  fill the gap \" of our coverage of the leading arm in the same way , and ( 4 ) by focusing on rather nearby sgr stars there is some potential for sample contamination by milky way disk m giants .",
    "we revisit the latter possibility in  5 .    to facilitate our discrimination of sgr stream targets from other milky way stars we take advantage of the ongoing studies of m giants in the stream that are the focus of this series of papers .",
    "apart from their intrinsic luminosity , m giants confer a particular advantage in the study of the sgr stream in that , as paper i demonstrated , the sgr stream has contributed the majority of the m giants found in the milky way halo .",
    "thus , m giants selected far enough away from the disk already have a high likelihood of being from sgr .",
    "figure 1 ( adapted from fig .  9 of paper i ) shows the distribution of m giants with @xmath18 lying within 10@xmath16 of the nearly polar sgr orbital plane , as derived in paper i. stellar distances from the sun ( at the center ) in this representation are given by the corresponding dereddened @xmath19 magnitudes .",
    "this kind of map has the benefit of creating an approximate relative spatial distribution free of biases imposed by presuming particular metallicities and color - magnitude relations needed to convert apparent magnitudes to photometric parallax distances , and works best when stars of a limited color range are used .",
    "since most of the m giants in the figure lie in the range @xmath20 , this magnitude - based distribution reveals the basic structure of the milky way and sgr stream ( modulo metallicity - based variations in the absolute magnitudes of these stars ) , albeit with an approximately logarithmic distance scale .",
    "this log scale has the benefit not only of compressing the apparent width of the distant parts of both the sgr leading and trailing arm , making them more visible , but of expanding the relatively small volume of space occupied by stars we have targeted in the northern galactic hemisphere , to make their relative positions more clear .",
    "however , as pointed out in paper i , the substantial stretching of the nearby sgr leading arm in such a rendition makes it appear more diffuse than it really is .",
    "the reader is directed to figures 10 and 11 in paper i for a linear distance version of this distribution where the nearby leading arm is less  fuzzed out \" , and to figure 9 of that paper for a  clean version \" ( without colored dots ) of the figure 1 distribution , for comparison .",
    "the reader is also referred to figure 1 of paper iv for an n - body model representation of the observed debris that provides a useful guide to the expected positions of leading ( and trailing ) arm debris in the sgr orbital plane .",
    "figure 1 ( and its modeled counterpart in paper iv ) provides one basis on which stars were selected for study here .",
    "but , in addition to specifically targeting m giant stars apparently _ positioned _ in particular portions of the sgr leading arm , we also pre - select stars that have radial velocities appropriate to these positions based on sgr debris models ( figure 10 of paper iv ) constrained to fit all available positional and radial velocity data for sgr ( e.g. , fig .  2 ) .",
    "the velocities used for this project  both those of the stars we targeted here and those that provide the constraints for the fitted models  have been collected through an ongoing medium resolution spectroscopic survey of 2mass m giants ( paper ii , majewski et al . in preparation",
    "; see also the data presented in paper iv ) .",
    "figure 2 shows , as a function of the sgr orbital plane longitude ( @xmath21 ) , the observed radial velocities , converted to the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) , of m giants lying near the sgr orbital plane . the rather velocity - coherent trend of the sgr trailing arm ( not explored here ) is obvious on the right .",
    "the rv distribution of leading arm stars is less coherent , especially where it comes close to the sun , because of the considerable angular spread of the stream on the sky at this point ( and therefore a wider variation in the projection of the stellar space motions on the line of sight ) .",
    "additional rv spreading in the leading arm occurs because of the greater overlap of stars with different orbital energies at the same orbital phase compared to the trailing arm ( see fig .  1 of paper iv ) .",
    "the trend of sgr leading arm stars in figure 2 is sinusoidal ( see also fig .  10 of paper iv ) . from left to right in figure 2 : ( 1 ) leading arm stars are first moving away from the sgr core ( at @xmath22 ) and have positive @xmath23 at high @xmath21 ; ( 2 ) after apo - galacticon the leading arm bends towards the general direction of the sun , and leading arm stars develop negative @xmath23 which continue to decrease as the leading arm curves towards the solar neighborhood and approaches from the general direction of the north galactic cap ( ngc , centered near @xmath24 ) ; ( 3 ) as the leading arm traverses the galactic plane near the sun , the @xmath23 changes sign again with the trailing arm stars now speeding away from the solar neighborhood and arcing under the galactic center ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that after passing below the galactic plane , the leading arm crosses the trailing arm ; the velocity trends of the two arms also cross in this region ( @xmath26 ) as shown in fig .  10 of paper iv . because the leading arm has yet another apogalacticon at @xmath27 , the debris , and the associated velocities , is expected to become less coherent",
    "this can be seen by the green points to the lower right of figure 1 in paper iv , but is not obvious by figure 10 of that same paper , which did not show this dynamically older debris . that the overall spatial and velocity distribution of the leading arm at this point becomes more diffuse",
    "can also be seen in the models of ibata et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see their fig .",
    "figures 1 and 2 , and the associated figures from our models in paper iv , guided the selection of four samples of stars for analysis here :    \\(1 ) a large sample of stars ( red symbols in figs.1 and 2 ) were selected to have both positions and velocities consistent with being in the leading arm north of the galactic plane , and in the general direction of the ngc ( with sgr longitudes @xmath21 = 220 - 290@xmath28 ) . of these ,",
    "21 were observed with the @xmath29=@xmath30 resolution mayall 4-m echelle on the nights of ut 05 - 09 may 2004 .",
    "on ut 10 - 13 mar 2004 , @xmath29=@xmath31 sarg spectra for nine additional m giants in the same part of the stream were obtained with the tng telescope in the canary islands .",
    "this  leading arm \" sample is the largest in our survey , because of our mostly northern hemisphere telescope access .",
    "a large range of @xmath19 has been explored , partly because when weather conditions were non - ideal we resorted to brighter , generally closer stars .",
    "indeed , some of the stars explored have initially projected ( i.e. paper i ) distances as low as 1 kpc .",
    "stars this close do lie among the galactic thick disk stars , but when selecting such stars we deliberately chose stars that lie along the leading arm trend in figure 2 , and which , for the most part , have strongly negative @xmath23 s ( e.g. , @xmath32 km s@xmath33 ) that are unlike the typical thick disk star .",
    "nevertheless , as a means to explore and limit the extent to which our analysis of this leading arm sample may have been affected by thick disk contaminants that just happen to have the  right \" velocity , we further divide this group even into a  best \" subsample ( the fainter , generally farther seventeen stars that are very highly likely to be in the sgr leading arm ) and a  less certain \" subsample of thirteen stars , including those stars marked with red symbols within the boundary drawn in figure 1 .",
    "the latter subsample includes the ten leading arm north stars with @xmath34 as well as three stars at the highest @xmath35 that are closer to the galactic bulge .",
    "if there is contamination of the leading arm north group by thick disk stars , it will most likely be among the latter sample , which has initially estimated distances from 1 - 5 kpc ( based on the color - magnitude relation for an [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.4 population assumed in paper i).=-0.4 .",
    "] we further discuss the issue of contamination , and the fact it is not expected to be affecting the overall conclusions of this study , in  5 .",
    "\\(2 ) ten m giant stars with positions and velocities of leading arm stars south of the galactic plane ( green symbols ) were observed with the @xmath29=@xmath36 mike spectrograph on the 6.5-m clay telescope at las campanas observatory on the night of ut 15 aug 2005 .",
    "these stars , with @xmath21 = 20 - 45@xmath28 , include stars with projected distances both inside and outside of the trailing arm and with @xmath23 well away from the trailing arm trend ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "according to the models of paper iv , the leading arm stars south of the sun were predominantly stripped from sgr roughly 2 - 3 gyr ago whereas those now north of the sun were stripped roughly 1.5 - 2 gyr ago .",
    "\\(3 ) six stars in the very center of the sgr core ( magenta symbols ) were also observed with mike on the same observing run as the other southern sgr stars .",
    "unlike the other groups of stars we looked at in this survey , these sgr core stars were not pre - vetted based on radial velocity data , but rather selected on the basis of the infrared color - magnitude diagram .",
    "based on the high density of sgr giants in the core , this was a relatively safe strategy .",
    "we subsequently derived radial velocities for these stars from the mike spectra ( values shown in table 1 ) , and these show them all to have radial velocities consistent with the sgr core .",
    "these velocities were obtained via cross - correlation against four radial velocity standards using the echelle order we used for the stellar atmospheres analysis described in  4 .",
    "we combine this small sample of sgr core stars with the other extant echelle resolution metallicities for sgr core stars in the literature in our analysis of the mdf below .",
    "\\(4 ) finally , we targeted thirteen additional m giants ( blue symbols ) lying among the stars of the sgr leading arm in the ngc that were found to have velocities quite unlike that expected for the sgr leading arm at this position .",
    "we refer to this sample as the  north galactic cap ( ngc ) group \" .",
    "most of these stars are too far away and have velocities far too large to be contamination from the galactic disk . on the other hand , while dynamically old sgr stars from the wrapped _ trailing arm _",
    " if they exist in the m giant sample  are expected to lie in the direction of the ngc ( fig .  1 of paper iv ) and with more positive radial velocities , initial estimates of the distances of the ngc group stars from the paper i photometric parallax analysis ( which , again , assumes an [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 0.4 giant branch color - magnitude relation ) puts these stars _ too close _ to the sun to be consistent with wrapped trailing arm debris .",
    "thus , obtaining echelle resolution spectra of some of these peculiar stars is of interest in order to test whether they can be  chemically fingerprinted \" as sgr debris (  6 and 7 ) .    to lessen potential metallicity biases ,",
    "m giant stars in all four groups were selected with a wide range of @xmath37 color  typically @xmath21.0 - 1.2 .",
    "otherwise , the specific selection of targets was dictated by the desire to sample the four groups of stars outlined above and by the limitations of assigned observing schedules .",
    "table 1 summarizes the targets , their equatorial and galactic coordinate positions , dereddened 2mass @xmath38 and @xmath37 photometry from paper i , the sgr orbital plane longitude ( @xmath21 ) , the velocity in the galactic standard of reference ( @xmath23 ) , and the spectrograph with which each target was observed and on what date . for most stars in table 1 we give two velocities :",
    "the first is from the medium resolution spectroscopic campaign described above (  3.1 ) , which has typical velocity uncertainties of about 5 - 15 km s@xmath33 ; these are the velocities that were used in the selection of the present spectroscopic samples and that are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the second @xmath23 values were derived from the new echelle resolution spectra by cross - correlating the echelle order that we use for the chemical analyses ( presented below ) against that same order for several radial velocity standard stars taken from the astronomical almanac .",
    "the estimated velocity errors for the echelle data are 1.6 km s@xmath33 for the mike spectra , 0.6 km s@xmath33 for the kpno spectra , and 0.2 km s@xmath33 for the sarg spectra .",
    "as may be seen , the echelle and medium resolution velocities track each other well , with a dispersion in their difference of 7.3 km s@xmath33 , which is consistent with the uncertainties in the medium resolution spectra . in the case of the sgr core stars we only have velocities derived from the new , echelle spectra .",
    "table 1 also gives the @xmath39 of each spectrum ; these ranged from @xmath240 - 190 for the mayall , @xmath2110 - 390 for the tng and @xmath235 - 120 for the mike data .",
    "the @xmath39 was determined using the total photoelectron count level at 7490 .",
    "to convert our 2-d echelle images into fully calibrated 1-d spectra we used the basic echelle spectra reduction routines in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "this process included overscan and bias correction , scattered light subtraction , flattening of the spectra by division of normalized quartz lamp exposures , extraction of the echelle orders , wavelength calibration using paired exposures of either a thorium ( sarg spectra ) or a thorium - argon discharge tube ( kpno and mike spectra ) taken at the same telescope position as each target observation , and spectrum continuum fitting .",
    "for the present analysis we focused on eleven unblended lines ( listed in table 2 ) found in a particular part of the spectrum previously explored by smith & lambert ( 1985 ; 1986 ; 1990 hereafter  s&l \" ) in their spectroscopic exploration of m giants ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "we used the iraf task splot to measure interactively the equivalent widths ( ews ) of these lines , which typically spanned one echelle order .    because three different instruments ( with three different resolutions  see examples of spectra from each instrument in fig .",
    "3 ) were used to collect the spectra , the possibility that the equivalent widths might suffer from significant systematic differences was investigated . in figure 4",
    "we compare the measured ews of lines in very high @xmath39 spectra of arcturus ( the one star we have observed on all three systems ) taken on each the sarg , kpno and mike spectrographs .",
    "the equivalent widths for the three different spectrographs agree reasonably well",
    ". only slight offsets of ew(mayall)@xmath40ew(sarg)=@xmath41 m   and ew(mike)@xmath40ew(sarg)= @xmath42 m   were found ; because of the sizes of the uncertainties on these offsets compared to their measured values , we elected not to apply any corrections between spectrographs .",
    "however , if real , the level of these offsets in terms of an [ fe / h ] value is + 0.09 dex and + 0.04 dex , respectively , offsets about those size of the estimated random [ fe / h ] errors ( see below ) .",
    "the final measured ews of the lines for each of the sgr spectra are given in table 3 .",
    "we also include there the ew s measured for arcturus from spectra taken on the the three different instruments used to make figure 4 , as well as for several standard stars we analyze next .",
    "a detailed abundance analysis from spectra requires as input parameters the stellar effective temperature , @xmath43 , surface gravity ( usually parameterized as @xmath44 ) , and metallicity .",
    "the first parameter , @xmath43 , has been determined using the dereddened 2mass ( @xmath45 ) colors and the houdashelt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) color - temperature calibration . in the following analysis ,",
    "the effective temperature is used in combination with stellar isochrones ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ; demarque et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter y@xmath46 ) to constrain the stellar surface gravity .    for a given population age and metallicity",
    ", a single isochrone defines a nearly unique curve in a @xmath43-@xmath44 plane , so that a given effective temperature defines a @xmath44 value .",
    "red giants can either be first ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) stars or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and these two separate phases of stellar evolution define slightly different @xmath43-@xmath44 tracks . however , the @xmath44 differences for a given @xmath43 are quite small in older stellar populations .",
    "this is particularly true for red giants with m - star temperatures ( @xmath43@xmath47 4000k ) , where the rgb and agb almost coincide in the @xmath43-@xmath44 diagram ( and where differences between the rgb and agb are measured in hundredths of a dex in @xmath44 ) .    in principle",
    "then , the effective temperature in an old red giant defines its @xmath44 .",
    "the two other primary variables that define the @xmath43@xmath44 curve are age and metallicity .",
    "all of the potential sgr populations are `` old '' , which here translates to ages greater than about 3 gyr .",
    "for a specific metallicity , the difference between a 3 gyr and a 10 gyr isochrone in a @xmath43-@xmath44 plane is not large ( about 0.1 dex in @xmath44 at @xmath43=3800 k ) .",
    "this is due to the small difference in mass between a 3 gyr red giant ( @xmath48 m@xmath49 ) and a 10 gyr one ( @xmath50 m@xmath49 ) .",
    "once a population is older than a few gyr , the exact age becomes relatively unimportant in defining @xmath44 .",
    "metallicity , on the other hand , does have a significant effect on the derived @xmath44 for a given effective temperature in an old red giant .",
    "this effect is incorporated into the abundance analysis here via an iterative scheme matching the isochrone used to define @xmath44 to the iron abundance then derived with that particular isochrone .",
    "sample fe i lines are used along with the photometric @xmath43 and an initial estimate of @xmath44 from an isochrone of a given metallicity to derive [ fe / h ] .",
    "if this value of [ fe / h ] does not match the adopted isochrone metallicity , a new isochrone is selected and the process is repeated until there is agreement between isochrone and derived spectroscopic stellar metallicity .    the fe i lines used to determine the iron abundance and final isochrone metallicity ( and thus the final @xmath44 ) are listed in table 2 , along with the excitation potentials and @xmath51-values .",
    "the fe i @xmath51-values in table 2 were determined by measuring these fe i equivalent widths in the solar flux atlas of kurucz et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and varying the @xmath51-values for each line in order to match the solar iron abundance of @xmath52(fe)=7.45 ( asplund , grevesse , & sauval 2005 ) .",
    "the analysis here used the lte code moog ( sneden 1973 ) combined with a kurucz atlas9 ( 1994 ) solar model , with @xmath43=5777 k , @xmath44= 4.438 , and a microturbulent velocity , @xmath53=1.0 km s@xmath33 .    a comparison of the fe i @xmath51-values derived in this way with those given for these same lines in kurucz ( 1995 ) line list yields a difference of @xmath54= + 0.14@xmath550.15 .",
    "this is a small offset between these two @xmath51-value scales , with a small dispersion comparable to the measured line - to - line variations found when the program stars were analyzed .",
    "the model atmospheres adopted in the analysis were generated by interpolation from the kurucz ( 1994 ) grids . in our iterative scheme , we also must assume an initial metallicity for the model atmosphere .",
    "both this and the isochrone used to estimate @xmath56 are iterated until the derived iron abundance of the stars agrees with the metallicity of the model atmosphere , and the metallicity of the adopted isochrone .      the abundance analysis method described in the previous section can be tested on nearby , well - studied m giants that have physical properties that bracket approximately those of the program sgr stream red giants .",
    "included in the observed dataset for this program are three nearby m giants ( @xmath57 and , @xmath58 per , and @xmath57 peg ) that were analyzed in a series of papers by s&l .",
    "s&l focussed their studies on a narrow spectral window , near @xmath597440 - 7590 for abundance determinations in m , ms , and s stars .",

    "the difference in the mean metallicities of the two samples , -0.72 and -0.64 dex , respectively , is much smaller than the mdf dispersions ( 0.31 and 0.33 dex , respectively ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the majority of the stars in the leading arm north sample are more metal - poor than the mean metallicity of the sgr core , so that their projected distances are even farther away from the milky way disk than initially projected based on the paper i photometric parallaxes that assumed a sgr core rgb color - magnitude relation .",
    "for the  best \" subsample , the implied minimum distances are generally 10 kpc or more , well above the galactic disk .",
    "\\(3 ) the median metallicity of the galactic thick disk , the milky way component most likely to contribute contaminants , is well known to be about -0.7 dex ( whereas the thin disk would contribute more metal rich stars in general , if at all ) .",
    "thus , we might expect the probability distribution of milky way contaminants to look very similar to the distribution we actually see , and therefore have little impact on the true mdf .",
    "\\(4 ) as we shall show elsewhere ( chou et al . , in preparation ) , the abundance patterns ( e.g. , the combinations of [ fe / h ] , [ ti / fe ] , [ y / fe ] , [ la / y ] ) of all but a few of the stars in the leading arm north sample ( and indeed in our entire survey ) are quite unlike those of milky way stars , but very much resemble the patterns seen in dsph stars , including sgr ( bonifacio et al .  2000 ; fulbright 2002 ; smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2002 ; shetrone et al .",

    "\\(5 ) the leading arm stars were pre - selected to be in the sgr stream and to follow the expected velocity trends for sgr debris .",
    "no evidence for other m giant tidal debris from any other satellite is found to intersect the sgr stream . because the bulk of the halo m giants are found to be contributed from the sgr system and we are probing the general orbital plane of the sgr system and well away from the galactic disk for the most part",
    ", it is logical to conclude that our leading arm samples ( both north and south ) are indeed dominated by members from the sgr dsph .",

    "while at this point it is true that we can not be assured that _ every star _ in any of samples , or any one particular star within them , is definitely a member of the sgr stream , a few contaminants will have little effect on the general conclusions of this paper , which are based on _ mean trends _ in the sgr mdf . in this regard , it is sufficient that _ most _ of the stars are sgr stream members and to recognize that the leading arm north mdf differs significantly from that of the sgr core .",
    "the leading arm south sample ( figures 7c and 8c ) shows an even more metal - poor mdf than either the sgr core of the leading arm north samples . with regard to contamination by the milky way disk , things are even more secure for this sample than for the leading arm north : not only are these stars even farther away from the disk according to the original projected distances from paper i ( and even more so if their projected distances are corrected for their newly discovered low metallicity ) , but they have an mdf even more unlike the milky way disk",
    ". the median metallicity of around -1.1 dex , the lack of stars more metal rich than [ fe / h]=-0.7 , the relatively small [ fe / h ] dispersion in this sample , and unusual chemical abundance patterns found in these stars ( chou et al .",

    "comparison of the sgr core mdf with those at the two points in its leading arm we explored here ( figs .",
    "7b/8b and 7c/8c ) reveals substantial evolution in the sgr mdf with position . while all three points of the sgr system sampled contain stars from a metal - poor population with [ fe / h ] @xmath85 , the relative proportion of these stars increases with separation from the sgr core .",
    "the latter shows a dominant metal - rich population peaked at [ fe / h ] @xmath86 , whereas the median metallicity declines from @xmath87 dex in the core to @xmath88 dex in the leading arm north of the sun and @xmath1 dex south of the sun , which represents debris lost from the sgr core some 3.5 orbits ( @xmath89 gyr ) ago ( paper iv ) .    while the figure 7c/8c mdf has only one star with [ fe / h]@xmath90 , because we are color - selecting _",
    "m giants _ our samples tend to be biased against finding _ metal - poor giants _ ( which are bluer and earlier in spectral type ) .",

    "] we address the implications of this gradient in  7 .",
    "in the course of our ongoing , medium resolution radial velocity survey of sgr m giants ( e.g. , majewski et al .  2004 ) we identified a subsample of m giants lying among leading arm stars at the ngc , but having the _ opposite _ velocity expected for _ falling _ leading arm debris there ( see @xmath93 black points near @xmath21 = 260@xmath28 in fig .",
    "12 of paper iv ) . because of their _ apparent _ proximity to the sun ( solid blue points , figs .  1 and 2 )",
    ", the origin of these stars has been puzzling .",
    "thirteen of these peculiar velocity m giants with median @xmath21=265@xmath28 were targeted with the mayall 4-m and tng sarg echelle spectrographs on the same observing runs and to the same approximate @xmath39 as the ngc leading arm stars (  3 ) .",
    "the relatively low metallicities of these @xmath93 stars ( figs .",
    "7d/8d ) indicates that the initial paper i photometric distances for these stars ( based on an assumed [ fe / h]@xmath87 ; fig .",
    "1 ) were underestimated by a mean factor of @xmath94 , based on the color - magnitude sequences presented in ivanov & borissova ( 2002 ) .",
    "adjusting the distances for correct metallicities  minding the @xmath95 of these stars and recognizing that the models were not well constrained for _ old _ debris  we find reasonable consistency of these stars with the sgr _ trailing arm _ towards the ngc ( see fig .",
    "12 of paper iv ) .",
    "detailed abundance analysis supports this conclusion .",
    "the mdf of these positive @xmath95 stars ( figs .",
    "7d/8d ) fits the general trend with sgr mass loss epoch established by the leading arm data ( figs .",
    "7a - c/8a - c ) ; as may be seen by comparing the mass loss epoch sequences of the leading and trailing arms in the paper iv ( colored point in figure 1 ) model , stars in our leading arm south sample and in the ngc sample , if it is indeed old trailing arm debris , were torn from sgr at approximately the same time .",
    "thus it is compelling that the mdfs in figures 7c/8c and 7d/8d look very similar to one another .",
    "in addition , this ngc moving group is found to have similarly peculiar , and abundance trends as stars in the sgr leading arm ( chou et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , further supporting the idea of a common origin with these latter stars .",
    "if trailing arm stars are found toward the ngc it establishes with certainty that the sgr debris tracks at least 3 orbits ( 2.5 - 2.75 gyr ) of mass loss ( paper iv ) ; because of much stronger phase mixing of debris in the leading arm , this fact is not well established by the apparent _ length _ of the sgr leading arm ( although previous evidence that it may exist has been offered by martinez - delgado et al .",
    "2004 ) . moreover , including the mdf in figures 7d/8d in the overall sequence shown in figures 7a - c/8a - c , lends further support to the overall notion that there is a significant mdf variation along the sgr stream .",
    "because sgr is reputed to have enriched to near solar metallicity by at least a few gyr ago ( lanfranchi & matteucci 2004 ; bellazzini et al . 2006 ; siegel et al .",
    "2007 ) , the observed mdf variation over the past 3.5 orbits ( 2.5 - 3 gyr ) of mass loss can not be due to an intrinsic variation of the instantaneous mean metallicity of the sgr system with time .",
    "rather , it must point to the shedding of successive layers within the satellite over which there must have been an intrinsic mdf _ gradient _",
    "( see also martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , the @xmath96 dex median metallicity variation in the debris lost over a 2.5 - 3 gyr timescale is quite large and suggests the loss of stars over a significant radius in the system . for comparison ,",
    "the strongest [ fe / h ] gradient observed in the sculptor dsph is about 0.5 dex over about @xmath97 ( @xmath98 pc ) , which is about 15% the apparent sculptor tidal radius ; however , this same 0.5 dex change also represents the _ entire _ variation seen across the @xmath99 of the sculptor tidal radius studied in detail so far ( tolstoy et al .",
    "sculptor seems to have among the strongest net internal metallicity gradients among milky way dsphs ( though some m31 dsphs may have larger gradients ; harbeck et al .",
    "2001 ) ; for comparison , the now well - studied carina dsph exhibits only a @xmath13 dex gradient from its core to its tidal radius ( koch et al .",
    "moreover , no large metallicity gradient seems to exist within the main body of sgr now : alard ( 2001 ) identified only a @xmath13 dex variation in mean metallicity from the sgr core to @xmath12 down the major axis .",
    "while the position of the current tidal radius in sgr is still uncertain , paper i argues that it is likely to be only @xmath2 3 - 4@xmath28 ( or sgr would be too massive to produce its observed dynamically cold tails ) ; thus the alard observation likely pertains to the beginning of the metallicity gradient _ within the debris tail_. therefore , we must conclude either ( 1 ) the destruction of sgr over the past several gyr has been fine - tuned to mass shedding from a narrow progenitor radial range over which there was an extraordinarily strong [ fe / h ] gradient for a dsph , or , ( 2 ) more likely , sgr experienced a quite rapid change in its binding energy over the past several gyr , which has decreased the tidal boundary of the satellite across a broader radial range over which there would have still been a large net metallicity variation , but a shallower and more typical _",
    "gradient_. orbits is that about half of the sgr m giants in the corresponding tails lie @xmath100 beyond the sgr center ( paper i ) .",
    "] such a catastrophic change of state happening so relatively recently ( 1/5 the hubble time ) points to a dramatic event affecting sgr s life several gyr ago , perhaps a transition to its current , destructive orbit .",
    "figures 7 and 8 not only provide the first direct evidence that the satellites of today may _ not _ well represent the stars they lost to the halo , but that this effect can be considerable . if tidal mass loss is typical among other dsph systems , as seems to be the case ( e.g. , muoz et al .  2006a , 2007 ; sohn et al .",
    "2007 ) , it might explain such puzzles as why : ( 1 ) the detailed chemical abundances ( e.g. , [ @xmath4/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] ) of satellites today appear to differ from those observed in the halo field to which they should contribute ( e.g. , font et al .",
    "2006 ) , ( 2 ) a system like the carina dsph , which exhibits clear signs of tidal disruption , presently holds a much larger fraction of intermediate - age than old stars today ( majewski et al .  2000 , 2002 ) , and ( 3 ) there remains a g dwarf problem in dsph systems ( e.g. , koch et al .",
    "2006 ; helmi et al .",

    "to demonstrate this point , we approximate the total mdf of the sgr core several gyr ( @xmath23.5 orbits ) ago using two methods to account for stars now in the tidal streams produced over that time . in the first method ( fig .",

    "but figure 10 illustrates how critically the observed mdfs of satellite galaxies may depend on their mass loss / tidal stripping history .",
    "we have discussed _ integrated _ mdfs as a function of position in the sgr system , but it is likely that , like other dwarf galaxies , sgr has had a variable star formation history including possible  bursts \" ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ; siegel et al .",

    "<S> we present reliable measurements of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) at different points along the tidal stream of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy , based on high resolution , echelle spectroscopy of candidate m giant members of the sgr system . </S>",
    "<S> the sgr mdf is found to evolve significantly from a median [ fe / h ] @xmath0 in the core to @xmath1 dex over a sgr leading arm length representing @xmath22.5 - 3.0 gyr of dynamical ( i.e. tidal stripping ) age . </S>",
    "<S> this is direct evidence that there can be significant chemical differences between current dsph satellites and the bulk of the stars they have contributed to the halo . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that sgr experienced a significant change in binding energy over the past several gyr , which has substantially decreased its tidal boundary across a radial range over which there must have been a significant metallicity gradient in the progenitor galaxy . by accounting for mdf variation along the debris arms , </S>",
    "<S> we approximate the mdf sgr would have had several gyr ago . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the mdf of a moving group of m giants we previously discovered towards the north galactic cap having opposite radial velocities to the infalling sgr leading arm stars there and propose that most of these represent sgr _ trailing arm _ stars overlapping the sgr leading arm in this part of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> if so , these trailing arm stars further demonstrate the strong mdf evolution within the sgr stream . </S>"
