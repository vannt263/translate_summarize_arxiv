    "as shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] ( a ) , for sample  2 the increase of @xmath2 with decreasing wire width is smaller than for sample  1 . we attribute this to the fact , that for sample 2 the larger extend of diffusive motion , quantified by the smaller value of @xmath19 , partially mask the effect of carrier confinement . due to the larger values of @xmath19 and @xmath3 of sample  1 compared to sample  2 , the shape of the loops responsible for interference effect is affected more by the confinement of the wire .",

    "probably , spin scattering processes other than the pure rashba contribution are responsible for this discrepancy.@xcite    an enhanced spin - orbit scattering length is very desirable for spin electronic devices .",
    "providing that the strength of the spin - orbit coupling itself remains unchanged , a confinement to a quasi one - dimensional system would result in a reduced spin randomization .",
