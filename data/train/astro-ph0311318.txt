    "nearby , young stellar associations offer unique advantages for detailed studies of star and planet formation . with diffraction limited adaptive optics ( ao ) near - infrared observations on 8 - 10 m class telescopes ,",
    "their proximity facilitates sensitive studies of individual star systems down to 40 - 50 milliarcsecond scales ( corresponding to physical scales of @xmath3 2 - 3 au at 50 pc , or 6 - 9 au at 150 pc ) .",
    "resolutions of a few au orbital radius imply orbital periods of only a few years , closing the gap between spectroscopic and visual binaries and thereby offering the prospect of a complete census of multiplicity among young pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars down to substellar masses .",
    "resolving companions spatially is important since spectroscopic observations by themselves only yield the relative masses of binaries . by achieving resolutions down to a physical scale of a few au ,",
    "it is not only possible to determine the dynamical masses of the components , but also to derive an independent distance to the system .",
    "thus , spatially resolved pms binaries are essential tools for testing models of pms stellar structure and evolution .",
    "searching for companions of pms stars is also important since this allows us to address the ambiguity when placing them on evolutionary luminosity - color diagrams .",
    "unresolved pms binaries show luminosity ( and possibly color ) differences compared to the individual components , thereby biasing any conclusions drawn from evolutionary diagrams ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) .",

    "we surveyed an additional 21 young stars ( 9 in mbm 12 and 12 in twa ) with the 10 m keck ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii using ao @xcite and the near - infrared camera kcam .",
    "the pixel scales of naco and kcam are 13.26 mas pixel@xmath5 and 17.47 mas pixel@xmath5 respectively .",
    "the science target itself was used as a wavefront sensor for the ao system .",
