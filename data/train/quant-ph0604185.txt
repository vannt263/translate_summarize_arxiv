    "in a cryptography protocol , we discus the possibility that two remote parties , conventionally called alice and bob , exchange a secret random key to implement a secure encryption - decryption algorithm , without meeting each other .",
    "once the sharing is achieved , the two parties can secretly exchange a message over the public channel by encrypting them with a key with a length equal to the message . in the key distribution with classical transmission lines ,",
    "an eavesdropper can freely sneak into the transmissions and monitor the information .",
    "thus the role of cryptography is to provide some mathematical procedure that makes it computationally difficult for the eavesdropper to reproduce the key from the information sent through the transmission lines .",
    "however , no existing classical cryptosystems has proven to present sufficient difficulty to an eavesdropper .",
    "in particular , it was shown that some of them can be broken in principle by quantum computation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , quantum mechanics ( qm ) and its fundamental concepts were previously restricted to clarify and describe very special issues of physics .",
    "recently , these concepts have been extensively used in such concrete problems as the distribution of secure keys between two parties . in 1984 ,",
    "bennett and brassard @xcite proposed a way of distributing the keys in a physically secure way , by using quantum physics .",
    "their protocol bears the acronym bb84 , and was the first protocol of quantum cryptography , but we shall use the more precise name of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .    in 1991 ,",
    "ekert @xcite proposed a qkd protocol that used entangled particles , and he stated that the violation of bell s inequality might be the physical principle that ensures security . in the quantum mechanical approach to key distribution , security is based on the laws of qm and not on the unproven complexity of a mathematical problem , as was the case with the classical cryptography . in these protocols eavesdropping by an eve has been considered , and it has been shown that they are secure against various types of eve s attacks ( for a comprehensive review see @xcite ) .",
    "after the earlier qkd protocols , various extensions were proposed , for example : a key distribution protocol in which alice distributes the key among @xmath3 different bobs , in such a way that only with the participation of all @xmath4 bobs @xmath5 the keys could be retrieved @xcite .",
    "continuous variable key distributions @xcite are among these generalizations .",
    "qkd protocols have been demonstrated over the past fifteen years through an ingenious series of experiments by several research groups .",
    "many encouraging experiments have demonstrated qkd , some spanning more than a hundred kilometers through optical fibers @xcite .",
    "hence , the possibility of a secure key distribution in the presence of noisy channels and decoherence has been considered @xcite .",
    "recently , a new approach to qkd was proposed by zhang , li and guo ( zlg ) @xcite , in which they proposed a qkd protocol that uses a quantum key to encode and decode the classical information by considering a previously shared reusable bell state which acts as the quantum key . in this paper , we show that their protocol is insecure against eve s attack and with a probability of @xmath6 , eve can be informed of alice and bob keys without being detected by them .",
    "hence , we show that their extensions to higher dimension @xcite and quantum secret sharing based on the reusable ghz states @xcite , are not secure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review some properties of qkd protocols in which data exchange between alice and bob is done , using orthogonal states . in sec .",
    "iii we review the original zhang _ et al . _ protocol @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv we show that this the protocol is not secure against some of eve s attacks . in sec .",
    "v we show that zlg extension to higher dimensions , suggested by karimipour , bahraminasab and bagherinezhad ( kbb ) @xcite is not secure . in sec .",
    "vi we present some modified protocols that are not only secure against eve s attacks , but also our protocol has simple qkd steps and any eavesdropping by eve can be detected by alice and bob .",
    "hence , we show that zlg protocol can be repaired , if we go to higher dimensional shared epr states . in sec .",
    "vii we show that quantum secret sharing based on the reusable ghz state among three parties , suggested by bagherinezhad and karimipour ( bk ) @xcite , is not secure and we repair this protocol . finally , in sec .",
    "viii we summarize our results .",
    "security of quantum cryptosystems is guaranteed by the two fundamental laws of qm , ( i ) no - cloning theorem of non - orthogonal states in quantum mechanics , ( ii ) any measurement on a system can cause a perturbation on it ( wave function reduction ) . on the other hand , in addition to the above basic principle , in a realistic qkd protocol , we mention some conditions that should be satisfied by any qkd protocol .",
    "as suggested by m. nielsen @xcite , to get the best possible cryptosystems , we need to have the following properties :    \\i ) the theoretical basis must be entirely public ;    \\ii ) actual implementation should be widely and publicly available ;    \\iii ) there should be extended periods of testing real implementations .",
    "in addition to the above conditions , any qkd protocol must have the following property ,    \\iv ) if alice and bob detect the presence of eve on the distributed keys , they should discard those keys and must apply their protocol to other states , and in this new use of the protocol they must detect the existence of eve again .    although , systems obeying these properties do nt necessarily have security , they have preconditions for being secure .",
    "a simple scheme was proposed by bennett @xcite , which uses only two nonorthogonal states . in this method ,",
    "nonorthogonal encoding of the bit of information inevitably leads to the waste of a portion of photons .",
    "in contrast to these schemes that use nonorthogonal states , some deterministic quantum cryptography schemes , based on orthogonal states , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "goldenberg and vaidman ( gv ) @xcite and consequently , koashi and imoto ( ki ) @xcite have presented a quantum cryptography based on orthogonal states .",
    "the basic technique is to split the transfer of one bit of information into two steps , ensuring that only a fraction of the bit of information is transmitted at a time .",
    "then the no - cloning theorem of orthogonal states @xcite guarantee its security .",
    "cabello presented a protocol @xcite based on gv and ki protocols and on the idea of using a larger alphabet that saturates the capacity of the quantum channel .",
    "he has introduced a key distribution protocol which works in the holevo limit @xcite .",
    "after this paper , some people attempted to get holevo limit by using another approach @xcite .",
    "recently , some people @xcite have used non - local variables , firstly introduced by bennett _",
    "@xcite , to propose protocols for qkd .",
    "these state , which are the product of two states can not be distinguished through the use of local operations and ( unlimited ) classical two - way communications ( locc ) .",
    "hence , zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented another qkd scheme that uses a quantum key to encode and decode the classical information , and the previously shared reusable epr state acts as the quantum key .",
    "they called it channel encrypting qkd .",
    "this protocol can be used for quantum secure direct communication , and was proposed and pursued by some groups @xcite .",
    "one of the best properties of qkd with orthogonal states is that we do nt use any classical communication ( although , earlier versions did nt have this property ) , because of the lack of classical communications , eve has minimum information about the secret keys that are shared by alice and bob . hence in this protocol , we make use of the total dimension of hilbert space .",
    "thus , the security of protocol can be enhanced . in what follows",
    ", we restrict ourself to protocols haveing no decoherence effects and in which all of the parties and eavesdropping operations are exact and the environment does nt interact with our system .",
    "in the zhang _ et al .",
    "_ protocol @xcite , alice and bob have previously shared some quantity of the bell pairs , serving as the quantum key @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the rotation can be described by @xmath8 the state @xmath9 does not change under bilateral operation of @xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of this operation is to prevent the other parties from eavesdropping .",
    "then alice selects a value of a bit ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) and prepares a carrier particle @xmath13 in the corresponding state @xmath14 ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) , randomly .",
    "the classical bit and the state @xmath14 are only known by alice herself .",
    "alice uses the particle @xmath17 of the entangled pairs and @xmath13 in state @xmath14 to do a controlled - not ( cnot ) operation ( @xmath17 is the controller and @xmath13 is the target ) and the three particles will be in a ghz state @xmath18 or @xmath19 then , she sends @xmath13 to bob .",
    "bob uses his corresponding particle @xmath20 to do a cnot operation on @xmath13 again ( @xmath20 is the controller and @xmath13 is the target ) . now the key particles @xmath17 and @xmath20 and the carrier particle @xmath13 are in the same state as the initial state :    latexmath:[\\ ] ] this state has an interesting property : carrier states corresponding to states @xmath66 and @xmath67 are not orthogonal to each other , and eve can not perfectly entangle her state to those of alice and bob .",
    "thus , for every round of the protocol , eve makes some errors on parties measurement results . with attention to the aforementioned strategy for the protection of the zlg protocol against the ggwz attack , in the following",
    ", we do nt consider this eavesdropping strategy for our proposed protocols which repair zlg , kbb and bk protocols .",
    "hence , it is not complicated to show that , in our approach to eve s eavesdropping strategy , it is not important whether alice and bob take an arbitrary rotation angle @xmath30 or use states of equation ( 6 ) . _ in both cases , eve can still take an appropriate rotation angle and measurement bases that help her to do eavesdropping . _",
    "recently , karimipour @xcite extended zlg protocol to @xmath2-level systems .",
    "their protocol is based on shared entanglement of a reusable bell state .",
    "the security against some individual attacks is proved , where the information gain of eve is zero and the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) introduced by her intervention is @xmath68 . however , in this section we show that eve can attack by a special strategy to get , with probability @xmath1 , all of keys without being detected by alice and bob .",
    "+ for convenience , we use the same notations as in @xcite .",
    "let us first give a brief description of the qkd protocol involved here . at the beginning ,",
    "alice and bob share a generalized bell state : @xmath69 , which is encoded as a basis state @xmath70 .",
    "they defined controlled - right and controlled - left shift gates that play the role of controlled-`not ` gate , and act as follows : @xmath71 alice performs a controlled- right shift on @xmath72 and thus entangles this qudit to the previously shared bell state , producing the state : @xmath73 with certainty . to protect this protocol against a specific kind of attack ,",
    "alice and bob proceed as follows . before sending each of the qudits , alice and bob act on their shared bell state by the hadamard gates @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are defined as @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the key point is that a bell state @xmath77 disentangled from the outside world is unchanged under this operation , while a state entangled with outside is not : @xmath78    eve s strategy is similar to that in the previous section and can be described as follows :    \\1 ) alice uses the particle @xmath79 of the entangled pairs and @xmath80 in state @xmath81 to do a controlled- right shift on it to produce the state ( eq . [ 10 ] ) .",
    "then , she sends @xmath80 to bob .",
    "\\2 ) eve intercepts particle @xmath80 and does a measurement in the @xmath34 basis on it .",
    "eve knows that alice , bob and particle @xmath80 states reduce to @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "\\3 ) eve sends particle @xmath80 to bob .",
    "bob uses his corresponding particle @xmath84 to do a controlled - left shift on the @xmath80 . bob measures @xmath80 and gets the classical dit corresponding to state the @xmath81 . at this stage ,",
    "alice and bob can not detect eve s operation .",
    "\\4 ) alice and bob apply the operations @xmath74 and @xmath75 on the their particle states .",
    "@xmath85    \\5 ) alice chooses another particle @xmath86 and performs a controlled- right shift on @xmath87 and sends @xmath86 to bob .",
    "\\6 ) eve intercepts and keeps particle @xmath86 to herself , thus , eve has a share on the bell state between herself and alice .",
    "eve prepares a maximally entangled state @xmath89 and sends particle @xmath41 to bob .",
    "\\7 ) bob takes particle @xmath41 and uses particles @xmath84 and @xmath41 to do a controlled - left shift on it @xmath90 bob does a measurement on the particle particle @xmath41 in the @xmath34 basis . with the probability of @xmath1",
    ", we have @xmath91 .",
    "thus , at this stage , eve shares two similar bell states between herself on the one hand and alice and bob on the other hand .",
    "@xmath92    \\8 ) for the next rounds of kbb protocol , in the case of the above state , eve gets the results @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) for @xmath52 odd ( even ) sequences of alice and bob results for fix amount of @xmath83 and @xmath95 .",
    "however , when alice and bob compare a subsequence of the data dits publicly to detect eavesdropping , eve leaks useful information for correcting her results .",
    "more specifically , for any odd ( even ) numbers of data dit that is announced by alice and bob , eve can determine which of the @xmath2 possible states is common among them . by this",
    "means , eve can obtain all of numbered data dits completely without being detected by alice and bob .",
    "\\9 ) thus , with the probability @xmath96 , eve can get favorable results .",
    "in other cases ( with the probability @xmath97 ) , alice and bob can detect eve s attack .",
    "in the preceding section , we showed that zlg protocol for epr pairs acting as the quantum key to encode and decode the classical cryptography is not secure against a specific eavesdropping attack , the f - type attack . in this section",
    "we suggest three modified protocols which are secure against f - type attack .",

    "they keep the measurement results on @xmath13 to themselves .",
    "the fifth and sixth steps are the same as in the previous protocol .      in the two previous qkd protocols , alice and bob restricted themselves to have two different types of states for security and some classical communication for some rounds of the protocol .",

    "every repairing of zlg protocol must have three basic properties ,    \\i ) parties do nt have classical communication ,    \\ii ) uses previously shared reusable bell state ,",
    "\\iii ) uses orthogonal state as carrier .    with the analysis of our eavesdropping attack ,",
    "the main defect of zlg protocol is the reduction of bell pairs to product state by eve s measurement on the carrier particle .",
    "thus , we choose some entangled state which does nt have this property . for example , we consider higher dimensional systems for sharing bell states that do nt reduce to a product state under eve s measurement .    in",
    "what follows , we need to define the controlled gate @xmath104 between one qudit ( as controller ) and one qubit ( as target ) .",
    "similar to kbb protocol @xcite , we consider the controlled @xmath104 that acts on the second qubit , conditioned on the first qudit , and defined as : @xmath105 in the above relation subscripts of the state vectors represent the dimension of hilbert space corresponding to each particle , and @xmath106 for the spin half target particles .",
    "thus , for @xmath101 even ( odd ) target state changes to @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) .    in our protocol , alice and bob have previously shared some quantity of the bell pairs , serving as the quantum key latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    when the process begins , the two parties operate hadamard gate on the their particle s state which were defined in the sec .",

    "( [ cnot ] ) ) on them , to the get the state : @xmath174 and she sends a coded state to bob and charlie . at the destination , bob and charlie act on this state by the controlled gates @xmath175 and @xmath176 and extract the state @xmath145 ( for further convenience , we restrict our selves to particles with even dimension @xmath119 ) . hence ,",
    "for the even bits which are encoded as state @xmath148 ( similar to bk protocol ) , parties apply hadamard transformation to @xmath122-dimensional ghz state which we denote by @xmath177 in the above equation @xmath178 .",
    "thus , alice entangles the state @xmath148 to the shared state @xmath179 by performing only one single controlled gate @xmath172 to produce :    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } & & \\frac{1}{d } \\left\\ { \\sum_{l^{even}_{1},l_{2},l_{3}=0}^{d-1 } \\delta(l_{i},d)|l_{1},l_{2},l_{3}\\rangle_{abc}|\\overline{q}\\rangle\\right .",
    "\\\\\\nonumber & & \\left.+\\sum_{l^{odd}_{1},l_{2},l_{3}=0}^{d-1}\\delta(l_{i},d)|l_{1},l_{2},l_{3}\\rangle_{abc }     at the destination , bob and charlie act on this state by the operators @xmath175 and @xmath176 and extract @xmath181 .",
    "noting that @xmath182 for @xmath183 , alice and bob must operate @xmath75 in the next round of the protocol .    if in the intermediate step of eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) , eve intercepts the first sending qubits and performs a measurement on them , then , the ghz state reduces to : @xmath184 , we have : @xmath185    in the above equation @xmath186 .",
    "thus , eve ca nt disentangled alice , bob and charlie states and we deduce that f - attack does nt apply to this approach it can be shown that for every round of the protocol , parties have a chance to detect eve s operation .",
    "eve can only entangle her state with alice and bob states and she wishes that after her operation , the parties , alice , bob and charlie , can not detect her effects .",
    "this strategy is the same as the ggwz @xcite attack , we showed to be removable easily .",
    "one of interesting results of our extension is that our protocol can simply be extended to higher dimension qkd between alice , bob and charlie , by using quantum key encoding and decoding classical information .",
    "in this paper , we review zlg , kbb and bk protocols for qkd via quantum encryption and show that these protocols are not secure .",
    "thus , eve has always a chance to be informed of her parties keys without being detected by them .",
    "that is , we have shown that the security conditions are a necessary condition but not a sufficient one , specially in the qkd with orthogonal states .    for the sake of completeness we briefly described the behavior of the presented schemes on efficiency of the transmission .",
    "we consider the definition give by cabello @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of a qkd protocol , @xmath187 , is defined as : @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the expected number of secret bits received by bob , @xmath190 is the number of qubits used in the quantum channel , and @xmath191 is the number of bits used in the classical channel between alice and bob . since in our scheme",
    "no classical information is needed in the message - coding , we have @xmath192 .",
    "this together with @xmath193 and @xmath194 leads to @xmath195 .",
    "however , the practical efficiency takes into account channel s transmittance as well @xcite . in our protocol",
    "( zlg protocol with higher dimensional bell states ) a qubit travels for a distance @xmath196 , @xmath196 being the separation between alice and bob . if @xmath197 is the transmittance of the qubit over a distance @xmath196 , after traveling the distance @xmath196 and the operation of bob , he takes measurement on the carrier particle .",
    "thus , the practical efficiency can be evaluated as @xmath198 . by comparison , in bb84",
    "it is @xmath199 , because @xmath200 , @xmath194 and @xmath201 , and a qubit travels a distance @xmath196 .",
    "this implies that the presented scheme is more efficient than bb84 , provided the transmittance of the channel is @xmath202 .",
    "it is also possible to see that ours practical efficiency is more efficient than m. lucamarini and s. mancini protocol @xcite if @xmath203 and that the entanglement - based scheme @xcite contains a factor @xmath204 , making it lower than ours @xcite .",
