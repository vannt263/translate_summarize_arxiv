    "the main differences between low-@xmath18 and gmrt samples are ( i ) a paucity of 21-cm absorption systems with @xmath7(mg  ii@xmath472796)@xmath581  and ( ii ) a lack of 21-cm absorbers among mg  ii systems with @xmath7(mg  ii)@xmath111.8  in the gmrt sample . while the first difference is probably related to our sample selection the second difference is probably due to a true evolution in the physical state of the mg  ii systems with redshift ( see discussion in the previous section ) .",

    "the absence of strong correlation between the total mg  ii equivalent width and the 21-cm absorption width is consistent with the idea that the mg  ii equivalent width is mostly correlated with the overall kinematics of the gas in the absorbing system and not with the column density in the component associated with the cold gas . in the case of j2340 - 0053 where we have access to high resolution echelle spectra , we find that the 21-cm absorption is not associated with the strongest metal line component ( see fig",

    "we provide spectra of all non - detections with upper limits on the 21-cm optical depth .",
    "we study the dependence of detectability of 21-cm absorption on different properties of the uv absorption lines detected in the sdss spectra .",

    "we notice that the detections found in a low-@xmath18 sample by lane ( 2000 ) also obey these joint constraints .",
    "low value of dr and high values of @xmath7(mg  i)/@xmath7(mg  ii ) in a system will mean a high column density of mg  ii and high neutral fraction .",

    "this is contrary to what has been seen at low-@xmath18 ( lane 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly most of these high @xmath7 systems have high dr and low values of @xmath7(mg  i)/@xmath7(mg  ii ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the equivalent width in these systems is dominated by velocity spread and not by line saturation .",

    "we show that this can not be accounted for by simple covering factor effects .",
    "as mentioned above and based on the available data , it appears that most likely the main reason behind this cosmological evolution is the decrease of the cnm covering factor ( and volume filling factor ) in the strong mg  ii absorbers .",
    "indeed , it is known that the number of mg  ii systems per unit redshift increases with increasing redshift . the evolution is steeper for stronger systems ( steidel & sargent , 1992 and p06 for recent reference ) . using the data of steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) , srianand ( 1996 )",
    "found that the strongest redshift evolution was seen among the mg  ii absorbers with @xmath7(fe  ii)@xmath472383/@xmath7(mg  ii)@xmath472796@xmath580.5 .",
    "this clearly means the physical conditions in strong mg  ii absorbers are different at high and low-@xmath18 .",
    "previous surveys ( listed in section 2 ) have hinted the lack of 21-cm absorption systems at high-@xmath18 ( @xmath69 ) compared to what is seen at low-@xmath18 , @xmath700.5",
    ". the low detection rate of 21-cm absorption in high-@xmath18 dlas is attributed to either the gas being warm ( high @xmath34 ) or to low values of the covering factor because of high-@xmath18 geometric effects ( see kanekar & chengalur , 2003 and curran & webb , 2006 , respectively ) . in two of our systems ( at = 1.326 towards j0850 + 5159 and = 1.209 towards j0852 + 3435 ) , the presence of a 2175 dust feature allows us to derive an estimate of @xmath32(h  i ) and therefore @xmath34 ( srianand et al .",
    "both systems have high metallicity , large @xmath32(h  i ) ( @xmath06@xmath7110@xmath72  @xmath30 ) and @xmath34 consistent with the temperature in cold neutral ( cnm ) gas . in the case of the system at = 1.361 towards j2340@xmath10053 ,",
    "the 21-cm line width is consistent with the absorbing gas having @xmath73  k. therefore , we already have 3 systems in our sample with properties consistent with the conditions expected for cnm gas .",
    "only 1 such system has yet been detected at @xmath69 ( york et al .",
    "thus our results are consistent with the increase of the cnm covering factor with decreasing redshift .",
    "however , to ascertain this result it would be important to derive @xmath32(h  i ) directly from the lyman-@xmath23 absorption",
    ". thus followup hst / cos observations of a uv bright subsample of our sample is very important to study the redshift evolution of @xmath34 . as pointed out by numerous authors , the physical state of the gas depends on the star formation activity in the vicinity of the absorber .",
    "models of multiphase interstellar medium suggest that the temperature of different phases depends on the background uv radiation field , metallicity , dust content and cosmic ray density and therefore on the local star formation activity .",
    "it is possible to conjecture that the evolution of @xmath9 as a function of redshift is probably related to the fact that at @xmath68 the average sfr in a galaxy is larger than that at @xmath67 so that we expect the cnm fraction to increase with decreasing redshift .",
    "we selected systems with @xmath741   but detected by chance a 21-cm absorption in a system with @xmath7  =  0.43(at @xmath75  =  1.3710 toward j0108@xmath10037 ) .",
    "efforts are underway at gmrt to extend our survey to weaker ( @xmath761  ) mg  ii systems .",
    "this will be crucial for understanding the physical state of mg  ii systems and to determine the detectability of 21-cm absorption versus @xmath7 .",
    "ideally one would like to estimate the number density of 21-cm absorbers and measure the cosmological evolution without preselection from the uv absorption lines .",
    "this can be achieved only by a blind survey of 21-cm absorption in front of radio loud qsos .",
    "it will be possible to embark upon such a survey with the upcoming square kilometer array ( ska ) pathfinders .",
    "in particular , the australian square kilometer array pathfinder ( askap ) with its instantaneous wide bandwidth of 300mhz and large field of view ( 30degree@xmath77 ) is an ideal instrument for this ( johnston et al .",
    "an askap survey with 150 pointings of 16  hrs each ( i.e 2400 hrs in total ) in the 700 - 1000 mhz frequency band would yield detection of @xmath0100 to 250 intervening 21-cm absorbers in the redshift range 0.4@xmath651 .",
    "we have estimated the velocity spread of the 21-cm absorptions using the apparent optical depth method ( ledoux et al .",
    "we do not find any statistically significant correlation between @xmath7(mg  ii@xmath472796 ) and the 21-cm velocity width in our sample .",
    "a marginal correlation is found for the low-@xmath18 sample .",
    "the absence of correlation in the high-@xmath18 sample is related to the lack of 21-cm absorbers among mg  ii systems with @xmath7(mg  ii)@xmath111.8  in the gmrt sample .",
    "this is probably due to a true evolution with redshift of the physical state of the mg  ii systems and consistent with the idea that the mg  ii equivalent width is mostly correlated with the overall kinematics of the gas in the absorbing system and not with the column density in the component associated with the cold gas .",
    "when high spectral resolution data are available , we note that the 21-cm absorption is not always associated with the strongest mg  ii component",
    ".    as the energy of the 21-cm transition is proportional to @xmath78 , high resolution optical and 21-cm spectra can be used together to probe the combined cosmological variation of these constants ( tubbs & wolfe , 1980 ) . using this technique on scanned data , tzanavaris et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained @xmath79 .",
    "our gmrt survey provides systems in a narrow redshift range in which this measurement can be done .",
    "thus high resolution optical spectroscopy of the corresponding qsos are suitable to perform this test at @xmath68 .",
    "we thank rajaram nityananda for useful discussions and providing director s discretionary time on several occassions .",
    "we thank the gmrt staff for their co - operation during our observations .",
    "the gmrt is an international facility run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
