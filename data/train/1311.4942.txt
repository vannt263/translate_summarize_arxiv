    "the _ compact muon solenoid _ ( cms )",
    "experiment  @xcite is one of two general - purpose experiments at the _ large hadron collider _ ( lhc ) at cern . from the data collected during lhc run - i , which ended in early 2013 , the cms collaboration has published more than 250 papers describing searches for supersymmetry and exotic phenomena , measurements of qcd , electroweak , top , bottom , forward , and heavy - ion physics , as well as the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "event displays are valuable tools that find many uses in collider experiments .",
    "these uses include validation of detector geometries , development of event reconstruction algorithms , visual inspection of reconstructed events , and also production of high - quality visual images for public presentations .",
    "one approach to develop an event display is to build `` from scratch '' by using a 3d graphic library , such as opengl , and a graphical user interface ( gui ) toolkit . in the cms experiment ,",
    "_ fireworks _",
    "@xcite , _ frog _",
    "@xcite , and _ ispy _",
    "@xcite , all of which are actively used , were developed in this approach .",
    "here , we took an alternative approach ; we created 3d models of the cms detector and events in an already - existing 3d modelling application , widely used by architects , mechanical engineers , graphic designers , and other professionals : _ sketchup _",
    "this approach allows us to use many attractive features of sketchup : it has a highly intuitive user interface and precise dimensions ; it can export and import 2d images in various _ raster _ and _ vector _ formats ; it can exchange 3d models with other applications in several common formats , e.g. , 3ds and collada ; it can apply visual effects on models , such as shadows , fog , and different rendering styles .",
    "the cms geometry and event data are converted into sketchup by using the sketchup ruby api  @xcite .",
    "our collection of ruby scripts are available on the github repository sketchupcms  @xcite .",
    "the following sections describe the rendering of the cms detector geometry and events .",
    "r7 cm         we obtain the detector geometry from the _ cms detector description _  @xcite .",
    "the cms detector description , written in xml , is the master source of the cms detector geometry used in the _ cms event reconstruction _ and the _ cms detector simulation_. it describes the cms detector as a _ directed tree_. each _ vertex _ of the tree corresponds to a _ component _ with a size , shape , material , and density .",
    "edge _ connects from a component to its subcomponent ; it specifies the position and angle of the subcomponent within the component .",
    "the ruby scripts take the following steps to render the geometry .",
    "first , the ruby scripts parse the xml files and recognize the directed tree of the detector geometry .",
    "second , they build each component as a _ solid _ with the given size and shape .",
    "figure  [ solids ] shows the shapes and the names of implemented solids .",
    "then , for each edge from the _ leaves _ of the tree to the _ root _ , the scripts place the _ tail _ component in the _ head _ component as a subcomponent at the given position and angle .    figure  [ fig : cms - image ] is one of the cms detector cutaway images often used in public presentations . the 3d model in this figure was rendered in sketchup .",
    "this figure was used in the cms official website  @xcite , posters created for cern open days @xcite , and the _ higgs boson discovery summary _ published in _ science _  @xcite .",
    "the level of detail in which to render the detector can be adjusted by choosing subcomponents to include in the model .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : eb - module ] shows a module of the _ barrel electromagnetic calorimeter _ ( eb ) , in which the geometry of each lead - tungstate ( @xmath0 ) crystal is drawn .",
    "figure [ fig : zooom ] includes detailed geometry of the innermost subsystems , the _ silicon strip _ and _ pixel trackers_. this figure is part of the exhibition",
    "_ `` zooom '' _",
    "@xcite , displayed at _ point 5 _ , a cern site in cessy france , where the cms detector is installed .        the cms detector will be continuously upgraded .",
    "the geometries for the detector upgrades , which are also described in the cms detector description  @xcite , can be rendered in sketchup as well . in figure",
    "[ fig : pixel - image ] , one half of each model has the initial geometry of the cms pixel tracker and the other half has the geometry for its _ phase 1 upgrade_. these two images were used to illustrate the difference between before and after the upgrade in many public documents , including the _ cms technical design report for the pixel detector upgrade _  @xcite .",
    "the event input is the _ ig _ format  @xcite developed for the ispy event display  @xcite .",
    "the content includes information necessary for 2d and 3d rendering of event data such as kinematical properties of reconstructed particles and positions and energies of calorimetric deposits .",
    "the ig format is simply a zip archive containing event files in json ( javascript object notation ) format ; a javascript object instance can be easily converted to a ruby hash .",
    "the sketchup ruby api can therefore easily be used to render the events . in the larger project , a ruby module named _",
    "ig2rb _ parses an unzipped ig file and renders a subset of objects .",
    "tracks and electrons are rendered as _",
    "cubic bzier splines _ , energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters as scaled rectangles with six faces , muons as _ polylines _ , and hit muon chambers as rectangular boxes .",
    "an example image of a candidate higgs boson decaying into two photons can be seen in figure  [ fig : higgs - skp ] .",
    "versions using other color sets and styles can be found at the cern document server  @xcite .",
    "we have developed a set of ruby scripts to create 3d computer models of the cms detector and cms events in sketchup via its ruby api .",
    "these scripts are available at its github repository .",
    "the 3d models allow us to produce high quality images and exportable 3d models of the cms detector and events , which are used in a variety of public presentations .",
    "in addition , these models can be used to validate geometries for cms detector upgrades . furthermore , several art projects , exhibitions , outreach programs using these models are being planned .",
    "we plan to continue to develop the scripts to extend the range of supported reconstructed objects , detector subsystems , and input formats and to improve the user interfaces for both interactive and batch uses .",
    "we thank michael case and ianna osborne for explaining to us the technical implementation details of the cms detector descriptions .",
    "we have received valuable feedback and support from erik gottschalk , lucas taylor , michael hoch , david barney , achintya rao , harry cheung , teruki kamon , elizabeth sexton - kennedy , and other members of the cms collaboration .",
