    "the cosmic web of filaments and clusters of galaxies , which is predicted in the highly successful @xmath8cdm cosmology @xcite , is filled with ionized plasma , _ i.e. _ , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "the hot gas with @xmath9 k is found mostly in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and cluster outskirts , and the gas with @xmath10 k @xmath11 k , which is also referred as the warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , is distributed mostly in filaments .",
    "they were heated mostly by cosmological shock waves which were formed in the course of the large - scale structure ( lss ) formation of the universe @xcite .",
    "the diffuse gas with @xmath12 k resides mainly in sheetlike structures and voids .",
    "the igm is expected to be permeated by magnetic fields just as the interstellar medium within galaxies .",
    "theoretical studies have predicted the existence of the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) . a number of mechanisms that can create seed magnetic fields have been suggested ; besides processes based on inflation and phase transitions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for review ) and",
    "plasma physical processes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) in the early universe , astrophysical processes include the field generations during the reionization of the universe @xcite , by first stars @xcite , and at cosmological shock waves @xcite , as well as the leakage of magnetic fields and cosmic ray particles from galaxies @xcite .",
    "the seed fields can be further amplified by flow motions induced by the hierarchical clustering during the lss formation @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation , the rotation of the plane of linearly - polarized radio emission due to the birefringence of magneto - ionic media , provides an observational means to exploring the igmf .",
    "there have been a number of studies of the intracluster magnetic field ( icmf ) through observations of rotation measure ( rm ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "for instance , rms of hundreds @xmath13 were observed in clusters , indicating an average strength of the icmf to be @xmath1410  @xmath15 g @xcite .",
    "in addition , rm maps of clusters were analyzed to get the power spectrum of turbulent magnetic fields in the icm ; for instance , a kolmogorov - like spectrum with a bending at a few kpc scale was found in the cooled core region of the hydra cluster @xcite , and spectra consistent with the kolmogorov spectrum were reported in the wider icm for the abell 2382 cluster @xcite and for the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "studies of rm outside clusters , through the cosmic web , are , on the contrary , still scarce ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , recently , constraints for the rm through the lss have been discussed by several authors @xcite .",

    "but the measurement error is still large , @xmath1710  @xmath3 ; that is , so far , the nature and origin of the igmf outside clusters has not been well constrained with rm studies .",
    "however , the next generation radio interferometers including the square kilometer array ( ska ) , and upcoming ska pathfinders , the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) and the south african karoo array telescope ( meerkat ) , as well the low frequency array ( lofar ) will enable us to investigate the igmf outside clusters with high - sensitivity rm observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "theoretical predictions for the rm due to the igmf have been made with model igmfs and simulations of the lss formation @xcite .",
    "especially , based on a physically motivated model , in which a part of the gravitational energy released during the lss formation is transferred to the magnetic field energy as a result of the turbulent amplification of weak seed fields , @xcite ( r08 ) proposed that the igmf follows largely the matter distribution in the cosmic web and the mean strength would be @xmath18 ng in filaments in the local universe at redshift @xmath19 . studying various characteristic length scales of magnetic fields in mhd turbulence simulations , @xcite ( cr09 )",
    "proposed that the rm coherence length of the igmf in filaments would be a few @xmath20 kpc .",
    "based on the model igmf of r08 , cr09 predicted that the - root - mean - square ( rms ) value of rm through a single filament would be of order @xmath21 . and",
    "using the same model igmf , we simulated rm in the local universe @xcite ( ar10 ) .",
    "we found that with the path length larger than the coherence length of the igmf , the inducement of rm is a random walk process , but the resultant rm is dominantly contributed by the density peaks along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the rms value of rm through a single filament was estimated to be @xmath21 , which is in agreement with the prediction by cr09 .",
    "we also found that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath4 follows the log - normal distribution , and the power spectrum of the rm peaks at a scale of order @xmath22 mpc .    in this paper , we extend the rm study of ar10 in the present - day , local universe by including the cosmological contribution . by taking account of the redshift evolution of the lss and the igmf as well as the redshift distribution of radio sources against which rm is measured , we calculate the rm through the cosmic web up to @xmath0 .",
    "we then examine the spatial and redshift distributions of the rm and their statistics . in sections 2 and 3 , we describe our models results , respectively .",
    "discussion is in section 4 , and summary and conclusion follow in section 5 .",
    "for the lss of the universe , we used structure formation simulations of a @xmath8cdm universe with the following values of cosmological parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the simulations were performed using a particle - mesh / eulerian , cosmological hydrodynamic code @xcite . a cubic region of comoving volume @xmath29 was reproduced with @xmath30 uniform grid zones for gas and gravity and @xmath31 particles for dark matter , so the spatial resolution is @xmath32 kpc .",
    "sixteen simulations with different realizations of initial condition were used to compensate cosmic variance .",
    "they are the same set of simulations used in ar10 .      as in ar10",
    ", we employed the model described in r08 .",
    "it assumes that turbulent - flow motions are induced via the cascade of the vorticity generated due to cosmological shocks during the formation of lss , and the igmf is produced as a consequence of the amplification of weak seed fields of any origin through the stretching of field lines by the flow motions .",
    "then , it can be modeled that a fraction of the turbulent - flow energy , @xmath33 , is converted to the magnetic energy , @xmath34 , as @xmath35 where the conversion factor , @xmath36 , depends only on the eddy turnover number , @xmath37 . here , the eddy turnover time is defined as the reciprocal of the vorticity at driving scales , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the local vorticity and turbulent - flow energy density were calculated from the data of the structure formation simulations described above , and the age of the universe at the redshift @xmath40 was used for @xmath41 . the functional form for the conversion factor",
    "was derived from a separate , incompressible , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of turbulence dynamo ( r08 ) .",
    "then , the magnetic energy density was calculated according to equation [ eq1 ] , and the strength of the igmf as @xmath42 .",
    "the average strength of the resulting model igmf for the whim is @xmath18 ng or @xmath43 g at @xmath19 . for the direction of the igmf",
    ", we used that of the passive fields from structure formation simulations , in which weak seed fields were generated through the biermann battery mechanism @xcite at cosmological shocks and evolved passively , ignoring the back - reaction , along with flow motions @xcite .",
    "the validity of our model igmf was discussed in details in ar10 .",
    "it was argued that our model igmf would produce reasonable results for the rm through the cosmic web in the local universe .",
    "the simulated passive fields reproduce the directions that show the expected correlation with those of vorticity .",
    "the rm coherence length for the igmf in filaments is estimated to be a few to several @xmath44 kpc at @xmath19 , which agrees with the estimation of cr09 .",
    "it is a few times larger than the grid resolution of our simulations , @xmath32 kpc . on the other hand , the coherence length for the igmf in clusters",
    "is expected to be a few @xmath45 kpc ( cr09 ) , which is smaller than the grid resolution .",
    "so the application of our model igmf to clusters would results in an erroneous estimation of rm .",
    "however , here we study the rm through the cosmic web outside clusters , and so we will remove the contribution from clusters to rm ( see section 2.8 ) .",
    "our model predicts that the igmf for the whim was a bit stronger in the past ; for instance , @xmath46 ng for the gas with @xmath10 k @xmath47 @xmath48 k at @xmath0 ( see figure 2 of r08 ) .",
    "it is because the density of the whim was higher in the past , although the magnitudes of vorticity and the vortical component of velocity were smaller .",
    "our model also predicts stronger igmf for the hot gas with @xmath9 k in the past .",
    "however , the igmf averaged over the entire computational volume was weaker in the past , because the volume and mass fractions of strong - field regions were smaller .",
    "to reproduce the cosmic space , we stacked simulation boxes up to @xmath0 , basically following the conventional manner of cosmological data stacking ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we took outputs at @xmath49 0 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3.0 , and 5.0 , and put the outputs of the closest redshift for stacking boxes ; 56 boxes were required to reach @xmath0 .",
    "the stacking boxes were randomly selected from sixteen simulations and randomly rotated to avoid any artificial coherent structure along the los .",
    "if a los went out of the boundary of a box , we applied the periodic boundary condition in which we replicated the box across the los .",
    "we also carried out the calculation with the open boundary condition in which we did not replicate the box but put different one from sixteen simulation outputs , and confirmed that the statistical properties of rm we examined are not sensitive to the boundary conditions .",
    "our galaxy is located in the local group .",
    "since the local group is probably filled with the magnetized whim , the observed rm could contain a contribution from the igmf of the local group ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "it would have been ideal to place the `` observer '' where the igmf and gas density are similar to those in the local group .",
    "unfortunately , however , not much is known about the physical states of the local group .",
    "hence , following @xcite , instead , we selected groups of galaxies identified in the simulation data that have similar halo gas temperatures to the local group .",
    "we considered two cases : groups at @xmath19 with 0.05 kev @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath50 0.15 kev and groups at @xmath19 with 0.05 kev @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath50 0.5 kev @xcite . here , @xmath52 is the x - ray temperature ( see section 2.7 ) . assuming that these groups are located in a physical environment similar to that of the local group",
    ", we placed `` mock observers '' at the center of the groups .",
    "we aim to simulate wide - field , high - sensitivity rm surveys that will be achieved with future radio interferometers .",
    "for instance , the upcoming possum ( polarization sky survey of the universe s magnetism ) project , one of the major surveys planned for the askap , will produce an rm map that will be a dramatic improvement over existing maps .",
    "the rm map from the possum will have a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath53 @xmath54 and an average source separation of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 arcmin ) corresponding to an rm grid of @xmath57 @xmath58 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "intending to produce a simulated map of rm , we adopted @xmath61 @xmath54 @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 arcmin with one source in each of @xmath65 equally spaced pixels .",
    "specific simulations for the ska survey and the askap possum that consider the feasibility of observations such as the effects of the measurement error , coarser spacing , randomly placed sources , intrinsic rm , and so on , as well as the galactic foreground will be discussed in separate papers .    for the redshift distribution of radio sources",
    ", we employed a distribution based on the estimation of the detectable radio galaxies by the ska and askap ( * ? ? ?",

    "we adopted the approximate gaunt factor , @xmath95 , and used the bolometric emissivity , that is , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    for the x - ray temperature of clusters and groups , we calculated the x - ray emissivity - weighted temperature as @xmath98 over a spherical volume of comoving radius @xmath99 mpc .    for the x - ray surface brightness and surface temperature up to redshift @xmath40 , we first sought all the grid zones , @xmath100 , and their proper volume , @xmath101 , which enters within the angular beam of @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath103 arcmin corresponds to the comoving size of a grid zone @xmath32 kpc at @xmath104 ; hence perpendicular to a los , less then one zone enters at lower redshifts , but more than one at higher redshifts within @xmath102 .",

    "here , @xmath110 is the comoving distance up to @xmath105 , which is given as @xmath111      the contribution from clusters was subtracted from calculated rm based on different criteria using x - ray brightness and temperature . the simplest approach would be to exclude the volume associated with clusters in the cosmic space .",
    "we employed the following two criteria . in the first model , labeled `` tm7 ''",
    ", all the hot gas with @xmath9 k was excluded .",
    "in the second model , labeled `` cls '' , the spherical region of comoving radius @xmath112 mpc around the clusters and groups with @xmath113 kev was excluded .    for simulations of rm surveys , however , a better approach would be the exclusion of the pixels that include clusters in the projected sky map .",

    "the value of @xmath4 is larger .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the inducement of rm is a random walk process ( ar10 ) ; the value increases with the increasing path length .",
    "also at higher redshift depths , the angular size of rm structures is smaller , since the distance is larger and the proper size of filaments is smaller . at the depth of @xmath0 ,",
    "most of nearby filamentary structures are smeared out , and the sky distribution of rm appears close to be random .",

    "then , the saturated value of @xmath143 increased slightly ; specifically , for tm7 , the value increased from @xmath148 to @xmath149 @xmath3 .",
    "the saturation for @xmath1 is mostly due to the convergence of the path length at @xmath150 and the @xmath151 dependence of rm ( see equation ( [ eq5 ] ) ) . to see this , we calculated the path length and also the column density across the whim with @xmath10 k @xmath152 @xmath48 k as a function of the redshift depth .",

    "the path length saturates at @xmath153 100 mpc for @xmath1 . on the other hand , up to @xmath154 , the column density reaches @xmath155 of the saturated value .",
    "but the contribution to rm from higher redshift should diminish due to the @xmath151 dependence .",
    "we can roughly estimate the saturated value of @xmath143 , as follows . since the inducement of rm is a random walk process",
    ", we may take the value as @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the rms rm induced by a single filament and @xmath158 is the number of encounters of filaments .",
    "ar10 estimated that @xmath159 . since the typical width of filaments is several @xmath124 mpc ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the path length of @xmath153 100 mpc corresponds to @xmath160 .",
    "then , we get @xmath161 @xmath3 , which agrees well with those for tm7 , ts8 , and ts0 .",
    "we also calculated the two - dimensional power spectrum with the sky map of rm .",

    "ts8 and ts0 , at the depth of @xmath139 , the power spectrum peaks at @xmath162 , which corresponds to the proper length of @xmath163 mpc at that redshift . as the redshift depth increases , the power adds up mostly at smaller scales . at @xmath0 , the power spectrum shows a broad plateau over @xmath5 with peak around @xmath6 .",
    "the peak angle corresponds to the proper length of @xmath164 mpc at @xmath154 and @xmath163 mpc at @xmath0 . with the typical radius of filaments of a few @xmath124 mpc",
    ", we argue that the peak in the power spectrum reflects the scale of filaments .",
    "the point that the power spectrum peaks at a small angular scale of @xmath6 could be the key to the search of the rm due to the igmf in future rm surveys such as the ska survey and the askap possum ; it can be used to remove the galactic foreground . towards the galactic poles ,",
    "the galactic foreground is expected to have the peak of the power spectrum at a much larger scale of @xmath165 or so ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the second - order sf is basically the fourier transform of the power spectrum .",

    "while it is very noisy but looks flat at smaller scales ( the noise is partly attributed to the coma cluster in the field ) . the sf towards the south pole",
    "is somewhat larger than that toward the north pole . as @xcite and @xcite noted , however , the error in the observed sfs is still too large to allow any concrete conclusion .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest that a substantial fraction of the rm towards the galactic poles may be attributed to the igmf . as a matter of fact ,",
    "our estimation of the extragalactic contribution to rm , @xmath146 , agrees with the estimation of @xmath173 from a survey by @xcite .",
    "measuring faraday rm is one of a few available methods to investigate the igmf in the lss of the universe , especially in filaments , which still remains largely unknown . using a model igmf derived from cosmological structure formation simulations",
