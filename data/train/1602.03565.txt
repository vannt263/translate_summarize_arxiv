    "the pion - photon transition form factor ( tff ) @xmath4 has been known to be the simplest exclusive process involving the strong interaction .",
    "it can be calculated asymptotically at leading twist as a convolution of a perturbative hard scattering amplitude and a gauge - invariant meson distribution amplitude ( da ) which incorporates the nonperturbative dynamics of qcd bound state  @xcite .",
    "the prediction for @xmath4 at the asymptotic limit @xmath5 is shown to satisfy the well - known asymptotic pqcd formula  @xcite : @xmath6 gev with @xmath7 mev .",
    "however , the data for @xmath8 measured from the @xmath9 process by the babar collaboration in 2009  @xcite have shown not only the serious violation of the asymptotic pqcd formula but also the rapid growth for @xmath10 gev@xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand , in 2012 , the belle collaboration  @xcite has reported their measurement of the @xmath9 process and has shown that the measured values of @xmath8 are consistent with the asymptotic limit of qcd for @xmath10 gev@xmath11 .",
    "hadronic das provide essential information on the qcd interaction of quarks , antiquarks and gluons inside the hadrons and play an essential role in applying qcd to hard exclusive processes .",
    "it has motivated many theoretical studies  @xcite using various forms of the pion das to understand the discrepancy of @xmath8 data between the babar and belle measurements .",
    "the general agreement on the analysis of the pion da is that the broader the pion da the steeper the slope of @xmath8 as @xmath3 is getting larger .",
    "for instance , the flat pion da  @xcite @xmath12 shows the agreement with the babar data  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent babar data  @xcite for the @xmath13 tffs , however , have shown that the use of flat da for @xmath14 and @xmath15 distributions strongly disagrees with the data .",
    "both belle data  @xcite for @xmath8 and babar data  @xcite for @xmath16 provided consistency with the perturbative qcd prediction and disfavored the flat da @xmath12 which is far different from the lowest twist-2 da @xmath17 predicted by the asymptotic qcd . accordingly",
    ", careful analysis of @xmath13 transitions  @xcite appears particularly important in the ongoing discussion over the pion - photon tff results .",
    "the purpose of this work is to comprehensively investigate the @xmath18 transitions using the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) based on the qcd motivated effective lf hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we discuss the meson - photon tffs in an exactly solvable model based on the covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) model of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional fermion field theory . performing both manifestly covariant calculation and the lf calculation in the bs model",
    ", we show the equivalence between the two results and the absence of the zero - mode contribution to the ttf .",
    "the @xmath1 mixing scheme for the calculations of the @xmath13 tffs is also discussed .",
    "we then apply the manifestly covariant bs model to the standard lfqm using the gaussian radial wave function .",
    "the self - consistent covariant descriptions of the meson tffs in the standard lfqm are given in this section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , we present our numerical results for the @xmath0 tffs and compare them with the available experimental data  @xcite .",

    "the transition form factor @xmath19 for the @xmath20  ( @xmath21 , and @xmath15 ) transition is defined from the matrix element of electromagnetic current @xmath22 as follows : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the momenta of the incident pseudoscalar meson and virtual photon , respectively , and @xmath26 is the transverse polarization vector of the final ( on - shell ) photon .",
    "this process is illustrated by the feynman diagram in fig .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) and using the plus component of the currents , we found that the lf zero - mode contribution is absent and only the on - shell propagator contributes in the valence region .",
    "the resulting lf amplitude @xmath42 in this manifestly covariant model is given by [ eq8 ] [ i^m_q_(a)]^lf= ^1_0 d^2*k * _ ( x,*k * _ ) , where [ eq9 ] ( x,*k * _ ) = , and @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",

    "we take into account the presence of two - nonstrange  ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) and strange  ( @xmath50)-components in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons as well as their mixing . making use of the @xmath1 mixing scheme ,",
