    "long - range forces can be found in a wide variety of physical systems , including self - gravitating systems , coulomb systems , wave - plasma interactions and two - dimensional hydrodynamics .",
    "the interest in studying long - range forces has been revived in the last decade , not only because of the broad domain of physical systems involving such forces , but also because of the presence of unusual phenomena , both at equilibrium and out of equilibrium .",
    "let us mention negative specific heat , temperature jumps , broken ergodicity and quasi - stationary states .",
    "reviews and books have been recently published in this field @xcite .    a particular , but interesting , case is the one of _ mean - field _",
    "interactions , for which each particle is directly coupled to all the others with equal strength , whatever their distance . although this is an idealization , it serves as a useful approximation and appears , in addition , to give at least the good trend",
    ". moreover , there are physical situations in which particles are all in interaction via a field , whose dynamics is in turn determined by the motion of the particles themselves : this is for example the case of wave - particle interactions in plasmas  @xcite , free electron lasers  @xcite , collective atomic recoil lasers  @xcite and traveling wave tubes  @xcite .",
    "this self - consistent effect can also be obtained in systems composed only of particles by introducing a coupling to an _ order parameter _ , as it is done for the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite , which has been widely studied in recent years as a paradigm for systems with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "the kinetics of models with @xmath2 particles and only mean - field interactions is exactly described , in the infinite @xmath2 limit , by the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "this equation exhibits an infinity of stationary solutions and its dynamical evolution starting from a generic initial state can be extremely complex . focusing on stationary states ,",
    "their stability has been studied using different methods , but mainly by restricting the analysis to _ homogeneous _ stationary states , that are characterized by a single - particle distribution function which is independent of the spatial variable .",
    "these states are of major interest in kinetic theory , because they often constitute the `` supposed '' physical equilibrium state .",
    "for instance a globally neutral plasma has an equilibrium which is also locally neutral , giving a _ homogeneous _ charge distribution .",
    "if perturbed , this state is expected to be stable , showing a relaxation back to the homogeneous state ruled by landau damping @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology is also observed in the hmf model @xcite , for which the homogeneous state is stable above a given energy threshold , which depends on the initial momentum distribution .",
    "however , below this energy , the homogeneous state is unstable and one observes a dynamical evolution towards inhomogeneous states , whose stability properties are much more difficult to determine .",
    "inhomogeneous states appear for example in gravitational dynamics @xcite , because of the attractive nature of the newton force .",
    "their stability has been studied in the context of the vlasov equation , yet the necessity to resort to action - angle variables  @xcite makes the problem analytically tricky .",
    "apart from numerical approaches ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , one can project the dynamics onto a fourier basis , yet at a cost of performing infinite sums  @xcite ; then , only a truncation can yield tractable results .",
    "such technique was also used in the context of plasmas  @xcite , where the waves often generate inhomogeneous states ; expanding the dynamics along modes , such as hermite polynomials  @xcite , requires anyhow a truncation in the sums .",
    "analytical results were also obtained on bgk modes , whose stability properties were connected , in the small inhomogeneity limit , to those of homogeneous states  @xcite . later on ,",
    "the unstable nature of periodic bgk modes under specific perturbations was rigorously shown  @xcite , but the problem remains open for other types of systems and perturbations .",
    "more recently , some general criteria were proposed to derive the stability of inhomogeneous states  @xcite .",
    "some toy models were also studied whose states are naturally inhomogeneous : this is typically the case of systems when an external potential is present in addition to the self - consistent one  @xcite .",
    "a first interesting model  @xcite is the mean - field @xmath3 model : an ising - like spin variable is represented by a scalar field in one dimension , acted upon externally by a double - well potential which selects two states ; the mean - field term of the hamiltonian is a quadratic coupling of the scalar field at two different lattice sites .",
    "a second interesting model is a generalized version of the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model to which an anisotropic external potential is added  @xcite .    in this paper we focus the above mentioned toy models , and show that one can treat _ exactly _ the stability of inhomogeneous states .",
    "the vlasov equation will be rewritten in action - angle variables @xcite and we will focus on those inhomogeneous stationary states whose single - particle distribution function does not depend on the angle variable , i.e. those that are homogeneous in angle . we will derive a general stability criterion which , besides giving the value of the threshold energy ( action ) at which these stationary states destabilize , will allow us to obtain the growth - rate of the instability .    in section  [ sec : theory ]",
    "we will introduce and discuss the vlasov equation in action - angle variables and we will derive the stability condition for inhomogeneous states and for generic mean - field and external potentials . in sections  [ sec : hmf - cos2 ] and [ sec : phi4 ] we shall apply the general method introduced in section  [ sec : theory ] to the specific cases of the anisotropic hmf model and of the mean - field @xmath3 model , deriving explicit analytical expressions for the stability threshold and for the growth rate of the instability .",
    "these theoretical predictions will be then compared with numerical simulations performed with @xmath2-body hamiltonians .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : ccl ] , we will draw some conclusions and we will discuss some perspectives of this work .",
    "let us consider @xmath2 particles in one - dimension whose positions and momenta are @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "they interact through the two - body ( symmetric ) potential @xmath6 and , in addition , each particle is trapped into the external potential @xmath7 .",

    "the @xmath11 term is a rescaling factor  @xcite which allows one to perform the mean - field limit discussed in refs .",
    "the prime will denote , from now on , the derivative with respect to the position variable  @xmath12 .",
    "( [ eq : pjdot ] ) and  ( [ eq : qjdot ] ) can be derived from the following hamiltonian @xmath13(q_j ) \\right)~,\\label{eq : hnbodymf}\\ ] ] where the @xmath4 are couples of canonically conjugated variables .",
    "let us introduce the so - called _ empirical measure _",
    "@xmath14 it can be shown @xcite that , in the @xmath0 limit , the single - particle distribution function @xmath15 obeys the following vlasov equation @xmath16(q ) \\right)\\partial_p f=0~ , \\label{eq : vlmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath17(q , t)=\\iint \\mbox{d}q'\\mbox{d}p'\\ f(q',p',t)v(q , q ' ) , \\label{defpotential}\\ ] ] is the averaged mean - field potential .",
    "one can also show that the @xmath2-body dynamics is well described by the vlasov equation over times that are at least of order @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "this makes the vlasov framework a natural one to study such systems when a large number of particles is involved .",
    "the vlasov equation can also be written in hamiltonian form using the following functional @xmath19=\\iint \\mbox{d}q\\mbox{d}p\\ f(q , p , t ) \\left(\\frac{p^2}{2 } + w(q ) + \\frac{1}{2 } v[f](q ) \\right)~.\\ ] ] after having introduced the appropriate poisson brackets for the functionals @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] @xmath22 the dynamics of @xmath20 $ ] is given by @xmath23 if one rewrites the single particle distribution function in the functional form @xmath24 , one obtains the evolution equation @xmath25(q , p),f(q , p , t)\\}=0 \\label{eq : vlasovham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26(q , p)=p^2/2+w(q)+v[f](q)$ ] and the brackets are now the standard poisson brackets .",
    "this equation is nothing but the vlasov equation  ( [ eq : vlmf ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium distribution @xmath27 , with @xmath28 an arbitrary constant and @xmath29 a normalization constant , is a stationary solution of this equation ( i.e. @xmath30 ) .",
    "in fact , all distributions that depend on @xmath31 only through @xmath32 are stationary .",
    "the existence of an infinity of stationary distributions is actually responsible for the peculiar out - of - equilibrium regimes in which @xmath2-body long - range systems get trapped over very long times @xcite .",
    "more specifically , starting from a generic unstable distribution , a long - range system typically relaxes towards a `` quasi - stationary '' state , which can be significantly different from boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium .",
    "quasi - stationary states ( qss ) can be interpreted as stable stationary states of the vlasov equation in the @xmath0 limit .",
    "the relaxation to statistical equilibrium occurs on much longer time scales , that were observed to diverge either algebraically @xcite or logarithmically @xcite with @xmath2 , depending on whether the `` quasi - stationary '' state corresponds to a stable or an unstable stationary state of the vlasov equation .",
    "relaxation to equilibrium is not due to collisions but due to finite-@xmath2 effects ( also called `` granularity '' ) , which can be modeled by convenient kinetic equations , like landau or lenard - balescu equations  @xcite .",
    "stable stationary states of the vlasov equation are therefore of paramount importance in order to understand the dynamics of long - range systems .",
    "it is therefore crucial to determine the general conditions for stationarity and stability , for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous states .",
    "let us consider the stationary state @xmath33 .",
    "if one focuses on the lagrangian trajectory of a single particle , one immediately realizes that it is a constant energy trajectory of the energy functional @xmath34(q , p)=\\frac{p^2}{2}+w(q)+v[f_0](q),\\ ] ] which is a straightforward consequence of eqs .",

    "the term action - angle variables comes from the fact that the dynamics of a lagrangian test - particle is integrable if the single - particle distribution function is stationary .",
    "indeed , for a stationary distribution @xmath41 , the potential @xmath42 $ ] is constant in time .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the test - particle is that of a one  degree  of  freedom system with the associated conserved quantity @xmath43 $ ] , hence integrable .",
    "a dependence of the potential on time caused by a non - stationary distribution @xmath15 would introduce an extra @xmath44 degree of freedom , thus breaking integrability _ a priori_.    in this single particle framework and for stationary distributions , the energy @xmath32 depends only on the action @xmath45 , so that a particle evolves on a trajectory of constant `` action '' @xmath45 at the constant action - dependent angular speed @xmath46 .",
    "the change of variables @xmath47 being canonical , the corresponding poisson brackets , which apply to functions of the phase - space , are equivalent @xmath48    using this equivalence and the condition @xmath49 , the vlasov equation ( [ eq : vlmf ] ) for @xmath41 can be recast in the following form @xmath50 hence , the stationarity condition , @xmath51 , leads to @xmath52 .",
    "this means in particular that the stationary distributions are those that are _ homogeneous in angle _ , with _ any _ distribution in action  @xmath45 .",
    "such a result highlights the relevance of action - angle variables for the analysis of vlasov stationary dynamics , but also for the study of qss .",

    "characterizing analytically the stability of stationary solutions of the vlasov equation will have an impact also on the characterization of the slow convergence to equilibrium observed in systems with long - range interactions @xcite , in particular on the study of quasi - stationary - states ( qss ) , which are ubiquitous long - lived states in the @xmath2-body dynamics of long - range systems .",

    "again , most of the studies on qss are for the _ homogeneous _ case .    in this paper , we have discussed a class of models where , besides the mean - field interaction , particles are subjected to an external potential .",

    "we have specialized this formula for two models : the hmf model with additional asymmetry @xcite and the mean - field @xmath3 model @xcite .",
    "for these two models it is possible to further simplify the dispersion relation and to obtain implicit equations that , solved numerically , give both the growth rate of the instability and the stability threshold . when the real part of the growth rate vanishes , the state is a stable stationary state of the vlasov equation .",
    "we have checked these results against the numerical simulation of the hamiltonian dynamics of the corresponding @xmath2-body system .",

    "a case in which the growth rate turns out to be in perfect agreement with the simulations is the one of the hmf model @xcite .",
    "those inhomogeneous stationary states that are also stable are good candidates to become qss at finite @xmath2 .",
