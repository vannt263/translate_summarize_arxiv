    "the major preoccupation of particle physics is the search for physics beyond the standard model or equivalently , for deviations from standard model predictions . to this end ,",
    "measurements at the cern lep-100 @xmath3 collider and the slac slc @xmath3 collider@xcite have provided stringent tests @xcite of the standard model of the electroweak interactions @xcite . however , it is mainly the fermion - gauge boson couplings that have been tested and the gauge sector of the standard model remains poorly constrained .",
    "a stringent test of the gauge structure of the standard model is provided by the tri - linear gauge vertices ( tgv s ) ; the @xmath1 and @xmath11 vertices . within the standard model ,",
    "these couplings are uniquely determined by @xmath12 gauge symmetry so that a precise measurement of the vertex poses a severe test of the gauge structure of the theory . if these couplings were observed to have different values than their standard model values",
    ", it would indicate the need for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the study of the trilinear gauge boson couplings by studying @xmath13 pair production is one of the primary motivations for the lep200 upgrade @xcite with a precision of 30 - 40% is expected from cross section and @xmath13 angular distribution measurements . in the far future",
    "there is growing interest in the physics that can be done at high energy @xmath3 colliders with @xmath4 gev or @xmath14 tev , referred to as the next linear collider ( nlc ) , the japan linear collider ( jlc ) or the cern linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "various options are being studied including @xmath15 and @xmath16 collisions where the energetic photons are obtained by backscattering a laser on one of the incident leptons .",
    "measurements at these colliders are very sensitive to anomalous couplings with @xmath15 and @xmath16 collisions putting some of the more stringent bounds on anomalous @xmath10 couplings @xcite .",
    "a problem common to many processes used to study tgv s is that they involve both the @xmath10 and @xmath17 vertices making it difficult to disentangle the contributions . in a previous paper we presented a detailed study of the process @xmath18 motivated by our interest in isolating the @xmath17 and @xmath10 vertices by appropriate kinematic cuts on the invariant mass of the @xmath19 @xcite . included in this final state",
    "are contributions from the underlying process @xmath20 which shows up most dramatically when @xmath21 . however , because of the muons masses it does not quite isolate the process we are interested in . in this paper",
    "we take the obvious limit and study the sensitivity of the process @xmath22 to anomalous @xmath10 couplings@xcite .",
    "this process has also been used as a means of counting the number of light neutrino species@xcite .    to parametrize the @xmath10 vertex we use the most general parametrization possible that respects lorentz invariance , electromagnetic gauge invariance and @xmath23 invariance @xcite since it has become the standard parametrization used in phenomenology and",
    "therefore makes the comparison of the sensitivity of different measurements to the tgv s straightforward .",
    "we do not consider cp violating operators in this paper as they are tightly constrained by measurement of the neutron electron dipole moment which constrains the two cp violating parameters to @xmath24 @xcite . therefore the @xmath10 vertex has two free independent parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 and",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 represents the photon and @xmath28 fields respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the photon and @xmath32 is the @xmath13 boson mass .",
    "higher dimension operators would correspond to momentum dependence in the form factors which we ignore . at tree level",
    "the standard model requires @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that the presence of the w - boson mass factor in the @xmath35 term is _ ad hoc _ and one could argue that the scale @xmath36 of new physics would be more appropriate",
    ". we will conform to the usual parametrization and will not address this issue any further .",
    "we studied the sensitivity of this process at tristan and lep / slc energies where there exists data@xcite that we could in principle use to bound the @xmath10 couplings .",
    "however , we found that the process was insufficiently sensitive at these energies to put meaningful bounds on the @xmath10 coupling with the integrated luminosities already accumulated or expected in the foreseeable future .",
    "we therefore start with @xmath2 gev appropriate to lep200 since this machine will be operational in the relatively near future @xcite .",
    "we then turn to the proposed jlc / nlc / clic @xmath3 colliders with possible center of mass energies of @xmath4 gev and 1 tev@xcite .",
    "we do not include any beamsstrahlung radiation effects in our calculation @xcite .",
    "these effects are very much machine dependant ( beam intensity , bunch geometry , etc  ) and known to be negligible at 200 gev , and small at 500 gev . however , although they can be quite important at 1000 gev , there has been progress in strategies to minimize the effects of beamstrahlung radiation .",
    "the diagrams contributing to the process @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "the main advantage of this process is that it depends only on the @xmath10 vertex .",
    "in addition , our signal ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) should increase with energy , for two reasons : it is a t - channel process and should not decrease as fast with energy as the other contributions to the total process , especially when suitable kinematic cut are imposed to eliminate the on - shell @xmath37 contribution . also , anomalous couplings , in general , become more important at higher energies .    to evaluate the cross - sections and different distributions",
    ", we used the calkul helicity amplitude technique @xcite to obtain expressions for the matrix elements and performed the phase space integration using monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the helicity amplitudes are lengthy and unilluminating so we do not include them here . the interested reader can obtain them directly from the authors . to obtain numerical results we used the values @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 gev , @xmath42 gev , and @xmath43 gev .",
    "the signal we are studying is an energetic @xmath44 plus missing transverse momentum .",
    "the largest potential background is bhabba scattering with a hard photon and the electron and positron going down the beam pipe .",
    "this should not be a serious problem given that we are interested in energetic photons and the luminosity monitors , based on bhabba scattering , should be able to veto any such events . in order to take into account finite detector acceptance , we require that the photon be at least 10 degrees away from the beam line although in practice the cuts we use to enhance the signal are much more restrictive than this ( typically @xmath45 ) .    in principle we should include qed radiative corrections from soft photon emission and the backgrounds due to a second photon either that is lost down the beam pipe or collinear to the hard photon being measured and therefore unresolved @xcite .",
    "although soft photon emission can reduce the cross section substantially , their inclusion does not substantially effect the bounds we obtain and therefore our conclusions .",
    "the effects of an unseen second photon turn out to be quite small . since",
    "both these contributions depend on details of detector such as energy resolution and do not alter our conclusions we leave them out but stress that they must be included in detailed detector monte carlo simulations .    the approach we followed was to examine various kinematic distributions , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and kinematic cuts to find which ones optimized the sensitivity to anomalous couplings . in general ,",
    "the tightest constraints were obtained by imposing cuts on the photon energy which eliminated contributions from on - shell @xmath49 production ( diagrams 1(d ) and 1(e ) ) .",
    "0.3 cm    a. @xmath2 gev    0.2 cm    in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath50 distribution for @xmath2  gev for several values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the most prominent feature of the distribution comes from the contribution of the on - shell @xmath49 ( diagrams 1(d ) and 1(e ) ) . from fig .",
    "2 it can be seen that the regions off the @xmath49 resonance are most sensitive to anomalous couplings with the greatest sensitivity in the region above the @xmath49 resonance . this is because that region probes the largest momentum transfer through the @xmath13-boson t - channel propagators .",
    "we found that the tightest constraints could be obtained by imposing an angular cut of @xmath51 and on the two regions of @xmath50 : 25  gev@xmath5265  gev and @xmath5388  gev . for 25  gev@xmath5265  gev",
    "the cross section is 0.14  pb which for an integrated luminosity of 500  pb@xmath54 results in about a 12% statistical error .",
    "similarly for @xmath5388  gev @xmath55  pb which gives a 50% statistical error .",
    "monte carlo studies of sld type detectors give very crude estimates of systematic errors of 5% for cross section measurements @xcite .",
    "therefore the effects of including a 5% systematic error are not particularly important .",
    "the 68% c.l . , 90% c.l . , and 95% c.l .",
    "bounds that could be obtained with these cuts for @xmath2  gev and integrated luminosity of l=500  pb@xmath54 are shown in fig .",
    "3 with numerical values when varying one parameter at a time given in table i. it is worth mentioning that the _ most efficient _ energy and angular cuts will vary slightly with the domain of @xmath5 and @xmath6 being probed .",
    "however , this dependance is mild and the limits will not vary much if one uses a fixed set of cuts .    an important question for lep200",
    "is the effect on the _ physics reach _ of different center of mass energies . to gauge the change of the sensitivity to the tgv s for different energies we plot in fig .",
    "4 the 90% c.l . for @xmath56  gev , 200  gev , and 230  gev . clearly ,",
    "the higher the energy the tighter the constraints that can be obtained . roughly speaking , increasing the c.m .",
    "energy by 15% will increase the sensitivity to anomalous couplings by 30% .",
    "however , even for the highest possible energies at lep200 of @xmath57  gev the obtainable bounds are not competitive with the @xmath13-pair production process or for that matter with bounds obtained by the tevatron experiments via associated @xmath58 production , and will , at best , be a consistency check of other measurements .    0.3 cm    b. @xmath4 gev    0.2 cm    we next turn to an `` nlc '' type @xmath3 collider with @xmath4 gev .",
    "we consider integrated luminosities of 10 and 50 @xmath59 .",
    "the photon energy distributions for a several values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "5 . as before ,",
    "the values of @xmath50 most sensitive to anomalous couplings are off the @xmath49 resonance and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are sensitive to different values of @xmath50 .",
    "for example , @xmath5 is most sensitive to @xmath60  gev while @xmath6 is most sensitive to @xmath61  gev .",
    "the bounds obtained from these observables are shown in fig . 6 with numerical values obtained by varying one parameter",
    "at a time given in table i. one could obtain additional information by using the transverse energy distribution of the photons with and without left - handed polarized electrons . for @xmath60  gev the cross section is @xmath62  pb which for an integrated luminosity of 50  fb@xmath54 gives a statistical error of 0.8% . likewise for @xmath61  gev we obtain @xmath63  pb and @xmath64% and for @xmath65  gev @xmath66  pb and @xmath67% .",
    "given the small statistical errors including a 5% systematic errors will have a considerable effect on the bounds that can be obtained .",
    "for example for @xmath60  gev where the statistical error is smallest including a 5% systematic error reduces the sensitivity by roughly a factor of 5 while for @xmath61  gev where the statistical error is larger it has only a small effect and for @xmath65  gev where the statistical error is largest the effect of the systematic error is neglegible .",
    "0.3 cm    c. @xmath14 tev    0.2 cm    the final case we consider is a 1 tev @xmath3 collider . in fig .",
    "7 we show the photon energy distribution for several values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . as in the 500  gev case",
    "we find that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are sensitive to different values of @xmath50 .",
    "for the photon energy range @xmath68  gev @xmath69  pb which for an integrated luminosity of 200  fb@xmath54 gives @xmath70% while for @xmath71  gev @xmath72  pb @xmath73% . including a 5% systematic error",
    "weakens the bounds on the tgv s considerably , even more so at @xmath14  tev than at 500  gev .    in fig .",
    "8 we show the bounds that could be obtained using @xmath68  gev and @xmath71  gev and give some numerical values in table i. the bounds obtainable on @xmath5 are down to the percent level necessary to probe radiative corrections to the gauge boson vertices . although the bounds on @xmath6 are also down to this level radiative corrections are about an order of magnitude smaller so that it is unlikely that deviations from the tree - level value could be observed unless there was a radical departure from the standard model by , for example , compositeness .",
    "we have examined the usefulness of the process @xmath0 for measuring the @xmath74 vertex . the sensitivity of this process to anomalous coupling is greatly enhanced ( by a factor of 5 - 8 generally ) by eliminating the on - shell @xmath37 and by splitting the energy domain of the photon into more than one bin .",
    "the process turned out to be too insensitive at tristan and lep-100/slc energies to obtain bounds competitive with recent results from the tevatron .",
    "in fact , the same is also true for lep-200 energies which at best will offer a consistency check of bounds extracted from @xmath13-pair production at lep-200 and the tevatron . at higher energy @xmath3 colliders , this process can lead to very stringent bounds , precise enough to test the tgv s at the level of radiative corrections .",
    "we used the high luminosities planned for at the high energy @xmath3 colliders to estimate statistical errors . when we included reasonable estimates of systematic errors we found that the limiting factor in high precision measurements will likely be systematic errors not statistical errors",
    "however , we based our analysis on optimizing cuts on @xmath50 and @xmath75 and it is likely that performing a more detailed maximum likelihood fit of real data would make fuller use of the information in the data thereby obtaining tighter bounds",
    ". the challenge will be to reduce the systematic errors and one should be very careful with respect to the conclusions one makes by considering only statistical errors .",
