    "the investigations concerning the interaction of black holes with matter and fields around then give us the possibility to get some information about the physics of these objects .",
    "one of these information can be obtained from the characteristic complex frequencies called quasinormal modes ( qnms ) which arises from the perturbation in the state of the black hole induced by its interaction with matter and fields ( for a review on qnms of black holes , see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of frequencies which are associated with damped oscillations depend only on the structure of the black hole spacetimes characterized by the mass , eletric and magnetic charges and angular momentum @xcite , do not depending on the initial perturbation .",
    "thus , we can use the observational data @xcite to estimate the values of the parameters associated with black holes and identify the existence of these objects , as well as we can use the result to get some information about their physics , from the classical point of view , or eventually , on their quantum properties .    on the other hand ,",
    "these modes are important to study the processes involving gravitational radiation by black holes , their stability and detection @xcite . along this line of research a lot of investigations",
    "have been done in different contexts which include gravitational black holes @xcite , as well as their acoustic analogues @xcite .    since the discovery that the universe is currently in an accelerated expansion era , several theories have been proposed to explain such an unexpected fact .",
    "one of them is the so - called @xmath0 theory of gravity , where the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by a more general action involving a generic function of the ricci scalar ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in a cosmological context , the @xmath0 theory introduces the possibility to explain both the late time cosmic speed up and the early time inflationary scenario in one same model , without the introduction of an @xmath3 @xmath4 cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath0 theory can be seen as an effective theory that introduces corrections to einstein s gravity . to give an example , the starobinsky model @xcite , given by @xmath5 , is a model that nicely fits the latest results on cosmic microwave background data obtained by the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "topological defects were expected to be formed by a vacuum phase transition in the early universe .",
    "these defects include domain walls , cosmic strings and monopoles .",
    "the monopole as a topological defect was first introduced by thooft @xcite as a regular field configuration whose stability is guaranteed by its vacuum topological properties .",
    "it is composed by a self - coupled higgs triplet @xmath6 and a non - abelian gauge field @xmath7 whose original local @xmath8 symmetry is broken to @xmath9 .",
    "this remaining @xmath9 symmetry is then responsible for a magnetic - like field whose behaviour can represent a point - like magnetic monopole .",
    "a global monopole can be seen as a similar kind of topological defect , but now with only a scalar triplet field under a global @xmath8 symmetry and no gauge field .",
    "the gravitational properties of the global monopole was first investigated by barriola and vilenkin in the context of general relativity @xcite , and later extended to alternative theories of gravity like brans - dicke theory @xcite and @xmath0 theory @xcite .",
    "our proposal in this work is to study the stability of a global monopole inside a black hole in @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "the thermodynamics of such system has been studied in @xcite and compared with the same system in einstein s gravity .",
    "also , the motion of classical massive particles was analyzed in this background spacetime @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to calculate the quasinormal modes induced by external scalar and spinor field perturbations . in our context ,",
    "quasinormal modes are resonant nonradial deformations of the black hole with a global monopole .",
    "these perturbations form a spectra of discrete and complex frequencies , where the real part determines the frequency of oscillation and the imaginary part determines the rate of damping of each mode due to the emission of radiation .    in this paper",
    "we will calculate the scalar and spin @xmath10 modes in the mentioned background and compare our results with the ones obtained for the schwarzschild solution .",
    "there are quite a few methods to evaluate quasinormal modes , and we have chosen to use a 3th order wkb schema as presented in @xcite . for low - lying modes this schema fits well with numerical results , as show in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the spacetime . in section 3",
    "we introduce the scalar equation we must deal with together with a brief introduction of the wkb schema .",
    "after that we calculate the scalar quasinormal modes . in section 4 we introduce the dirac equation in the considered spacetime and use the same wkb schema to calculate the spin @xmath10 quasinormal modes . in section 5 , we present our conclusions .",
    "the metric generated by a static and spherically symmetric black hole with a global monopole in @xmath0 gravity is given by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 being a constant which measures the deviation of this solution that corresponds , in fact , to a global monopole in @xmath0 gravity , from the global monopole in general relativity @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 above is a mass parameter and we will consider it as the total mass of the black hole with a global monopole inside it . the @xmath15 parameter is related to the scale of symmetry breaking , which is of the order of @xmath16 gev for a typical grand unified theory ( gut ) . for consistence we should have @xmath17 , otherwise ( [ eq : metric_spherically_monopole ] ) is not the valid metric for the system under consideration @xcite .",
    "we are using units where @xmath18 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_metric_spherically_monopole ] ) , we have that the horizon surface equation is obtained from the condition @xmath19 the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : surface_hor_spherically_monopole ] ) are @xmath20 and so we have two horizons for this metric . the interior horizon can be considered the black hole event horizon and goes to @xmath21 when @xmath22 and @xmath23 , while the exterior one is a kind of cosmological horizon and blows up for @xmath24 and @xmath2 .",
    "this second result is due to the fact that we do nt have this exterior horizon in the schwarzschild spacetime and the above metric should reduce to the schwarzschild metric in the appropriate regime , namely , as @xmath25 .",
    "the more straightforward way to study perturbations in a black hole spacetime is to introduce fields around it and demand that the fields do not produce a backreaction on the background . for a massive scalar field ,",
    "the perturbations are described by the klein - gordon equation in a curved spacetime , which is given by the following covariant form @xmath26\\psi=0\\ , \\label{eq : klein - gordon}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a parameter that is identified with the mass of the scalar field .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric_spherically_monopole ] ) into eq .  ( [ eq : klein - gordon ] ) , we obtain @xmath28\\psi=0\\ , \\label{eq : mov_spherically_monopole}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the angular momentum operator .    due to the time independence and symmetry of the spacetime with respect to rotations , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mov_spherically_monopole ] ) can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the usual spherical harmonics .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz_solution_spherically_monopole ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : mov_spherically_monopole ] ) , we find that @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the form of the radial equation given by eq.([eq : mov_radial_spherically_monopole ] ) is not appropriate to study the qnms . in order to find the ideal form ,",
    "let us perform a coordinate transformation , defined by the following relation    @xmath34    the coordinate @xmath35 maps the region between the horizons into the @xmath36 region and is called the tortoise coordinate .",
    "the radial klein - gordon equation then reads    @xmath37    where    @xmath38    with the @xmath39 indicating derivative with respect to @xmath40",
    ". we will consider @xmath27 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the wkb method is a fairly well know technique used to obtain approximated solutions to the one - dimensional time independent schredinger equation . in the gravitational arena ,",
    "it was applied by schutz and will @xcite to the problem of scattering on black holes .    here",
    "we will use the wkb method to compute the quasinormal modes @xmath41 .",
    "we will use the third order approximation as given by @xcite .",
    "this method has been extensively used in different black hole configurations and is accurate up to a few percents for both the real and imaginary parts for low - lying modes with @xmath42 .",
    "the method was further extended up to the sixth order in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ tb : tablespinhalf ]",
    "theory , for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the continuous line represents the same modes for the schwarzschild solution . ]",
    "we have evaluated the massless quasinormal modes for a black hole with a global monopole in @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "we did it for the spin @xmath45 and spin @xmath10 cases using the third order wkb approximation .",
    "we have focused on the role played by the parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath46 means we are going from @xmath0 gravity to einstein s gravity .",
    "the presented metric is only valid for @xmath47 and we have explicitly showed that as @xmath1 grows we can no longer expect a well - behaved effective potential for the scalar field , and so the proposed constraint for the @xmath1 parameter is consistent .    in the case",
    "where @xmath48 , the quasinormal mode frequencies are well defined and indicates a stable black hole solution with a global monopole inside it . we have compared our obtained results with the frequencies for the schwarzschild black hole and found that they follow the same pattern , both for the spin @xmath45 and spin @xmath10 cases .",
