    "bose einstein condensates ( bec ) in double well potentials have drawn a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally for the possibilities they offer to study fundamental quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level as well as for potential applications like interferometry , high precision measurements or thermometry @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental realizations lead to the splitting of the condensate into two independent parts . nevertheless , recently , also weakly linked parts of a bec in a double well potential forming a single josephson junction @xcite have been achieved @xcite .",
    "in contrast to josephson junctions realized in superconductors and superfluids @xcite , in bec the non - linear interatomic interactions play a crucial role . in the presence of the non - linearity",
    "two dynamical regimes have been predicted : ( i ) anharmonic josephson oscillations @xcite , if the initial population imbalance of the two wells is below a critical value and ( ii ) macroscopic quantum self - trapping @xcite i.e , inhibition of large amplitude josephson oscillations above the threshold for the population imbalance .",
    "this threshold corresponds to the population imbalance for which the difference between the two on - site interaction energies becomes larger than the tunneling energy splitting .",
    "both dynamical regimes have been explored experimentally in a single josephson junction @xcite and in arrays @xcite .",
    "recently , a lot of attention has been devoted to explore techniques to coherently control the non - linear dynamics of a bec in double well potentials by modulating in time either the potential @xcite or the non - linearity @xcite .",
    "the two main studied regimes are the non - linear landau - zener @xcite and the rosen - zener @xcite regimes . in the former",
    "the tunneling rate is fixed while the energy bias is linearly varied in time , in the later the energy bias is varied in time while the tunneling rate is switching on / off following e.g. , a temporal gaussian profile .",
    "both these regimes have been deeply investigated in double @xcite and triple well @xcite potentials yielding a wide variety of dynamical scenarios ranging from robust population transfer to quantum blocking , non - linear oscillations and , even , breaking down of the adiabatic dynamics .    following a different perspective ,",
    "there have been several recent proposals to coherently manipulate single atoms @xcite and becs @xcite in triple - well potentials by adiabatically following a particular energy eigenstate of the system , the so - called spatial dark state .",
    "this spatial dark state only involves the two ground states of the extreme traps in a close analogy to the well known quantum optical stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) technique @xcite .",
    "accordingly , these tools were named three - level atom optics ( tlao ) techniques @xcite . in this paper , following the work by vitanov and shore @xcite on the adiabatic passage on two - level atoms , we extend the tlao techniques to the two - level matter wave case showing that the adiabatic dynamics of a bec , in a double well potential , can be described in terms of a dark variable resulting from the combination of the population imbalance and the spatial atomic coherence .",
    "this dark variable can be tailored varying in time the tunneling rate , the energy bias , and the non - linearity with the goal of ( i ) adiabatically splitting of the bec , ( ii ) achieving complete bec transfer from one well to the other ; and ( iii ) preparing of an adiabatic self - trapping state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the physical system consisting of a bec in a double - well potential .",
    "we assume the two - level approximation and describe the bec dynamics in terms of a dark variable .",
    "the conditions for the adiabatic control of tunneling by means of this dark variable are discussed in section  iii from a non - linear dynamics perspective . in section",
    "iv we present detailed numerical simulations on the adiabatic splitting , transport , and trapping of a bec .",
    "section  v summarizes the main conclusions of the paper and briefly discusses the validity of the two - mode approximation .",
    "it also presents some possible extensions of the present work such as its formulation in second quantization .",
    "we consider a bec trapped in a double well potential ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , whose dynamics at zero temperature is described by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) ( @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 \\psi ( \\vec{r},t ) ,   \\label{gpe}\\]]where @xmath2 is the external trapping potential and the non - linearity is given by @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the total atom number , @xmath5 the @xmath6-wave scattering length , and @xmath7 the atomic mass . assuming the two - level approximation @xcite , the wave function or classical order parameter of the bec under study can be written as @xmath8 with @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 accounts for the ground state of the corresponding isolated trap .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath12 and @xmath13 obey the non - linear two - mode dynamical equations given by : @xmath14 with the hamiltonian : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the atomic self - interaction energies , @xmath17 is the tunneling rate between the two wells , and @xmath18 are the on - site energies . in terms of the @xmath11 overlaps ,",
    "the former parameters read : @xmath19\\\\ u_{l , r}&=&g \\int d\\vec{r } \\left|\\phi_{l , r}\\right|^4\\\\ \\epsilon_{r , l}&=&\\int d\\vec{r}\\left[\\frac{1}{2m}\\left|\\nabla \\phi_{r , l}\\right|^2 + \\phi_{r , l}^*v(\\vec{r},t)\\phi_{r , l } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20=\\delta_{ij } \\ , ( i , j = l , r)$ ] .",
    "notice that the two - mode approximation assumes that the parameters of the problem ( tunneling rate , non - linear interaction , and energy bias ) can be varied independently . in general , however , the temporal modification of any of these parameters will result in the modification of the spatial mode functions affecting the rest of the parameters . from the experimental point of view , a double",

    "in addition , the scattering length could be controlled playing around of a feshbach resonance @xcite .    within the density matrix formalism , assuming @xmath21 , and taking @xmath22 as the energy bias between the two wells , the coherent dynamics of the bec in the two - well potential can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath23 where we have introduced the real - valued variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 ,  @xmath26 being @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 the corresponding trap populations and spatial coherence ( see fig .",

    "by means of a dark variable that results from the combination of the population imbalance and the spatial atomic coherence , we have investigated in detail the adiabatic dynamics of a bec in a double well potential in the framework of the two - level approximation . we have shown that it is possible to robustly split , transport or trap a bec by appropriate temporal variation of either the energy bias or the non - linear interaction together with the tunneling rate .",
    "all these proposals have been studied from a non - linear dynamics perspective deriving the stationary solutions of the system , evaluating their linear stability , and discussing the bifurcation scenarios . for the eventual implementation of the techniques here discussed ,",
    "we want to highlight the recent work by m. bauer _ et al_. @xcite reporting an accurate control on magnetic feshbach resonances by means of laser light .    in order to check the validity of the two - mode approximation , we have numerically integrated the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the non - linear adiabatic splitting of a bec in a double - well potential , obtaining the characteristic plateau of the stirap protocol shown in fig .",
    "however , a detailed numerical investigation of the gp equation still remains to be performed to validate that the matter wave non - linear stirap techniques here derived in the two - mode approximation could be used for matter wave interferometry or coherent transport of a bec . in performing this analysis ,",
    "the global landscape provided by the results of the two - mode approximation should be a useful roadmap .",
    "although it is out of the scope of the present paper , it would be very interesting also to extend the present non - linear matter wave stirap techniques to the second - quantization formalism @xcite . within this formalism",
    ", we could elucidate whether the adiabatic splitting of the bec results in a macroscopic superposition where the entire condensate localizes in one of the wells , i.e. in a noon state @xcite , or in a perfect 50% spatial splitting of all the atoms . note that in both cases the final population difference reads @xmath122=0 .",

    "one eigenvalue is equal to zero while the other two are either pure imaginary corresponding to a stable fixed point ( or center ) , or pure real accounting for an unstable one ( or saddle point ) .",
