    "quantum entanglement and nonlocality are two aspects of correlations which are intimately related to each other@xcite .",
    "such fundamental aspects of quantum theory are extensively studied@xcite and today also its an emerging field of research .",
    "the correlated properties of entangled two - photon states have attracted attentions , due to their extensive applications in quantum optics and quantum information@xcite . as a result ,",
    "strekalov et.al demonstrated the ghost interference experiment@xcite , which show a nonlocal behaviour with spontaneous parametric down - conversion(spdc)@xcite source s , a common method of producing entangled photons , conventionally called signal and idler beam@xcite , are then split by a polarized beam splitter into two beams , detected in coincidence by two distant pointlike photon detectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a double - slit is in the path of photon 1 , and the detector @xmath0 is kept behind ( see fig .",
    "[ ghostexp](a ) ) , no interference pattern is observed for photon 1 , surprisingly , as one would normally expect young s double - slit interference . also when the photon 2 is detected by @xmath1 , _ in coincidence _ with a _ fixed _",
    "detector @xmath0 , the double - slit interference pattern is observed ( see fig . [ ghostexp](b ) ) , even though there is no double - slit in the path of photon 2 .",
    "many interesting outcomes are due to the spatial correlations which is with twin photons , produced in parametric down - conversion@xcite .    the two slit experiment has also been studied extensively in context of wave - particle duality and bohr s principle of complementarity .",
    "the fact that the wave and particle nature can not be observed at the same time , is so fundamental that bohr gave the principle , known as , the principle of complementarity@xcite .",
    "bohr stressed that the wave nature of particle , characterized by interference , and the particle nature , characterized by which way ( i.e. , which path ) information , are mutually exclusive .",
    "a further question investigation was if the two natures could be observed simultaneously , and to what level of accuracy .",
    "a bound on simultaneous path distinguishability and fringe visibility is described by the so - called englert - greenberger - yasin ( egy ) relation@xcite .",
    "the egy duality relation is _ local _ , in the sense that when we talk of which - path distinguishability , we talk of the which - path knowledge of the same particle giving interference pattern .",
    "a _ nonlocal _",
    "duality relation was derived for two slit experiment@xcite , which relates the which - path information of one particle to the fringe visibility of the other .    at present",
    "the search for an analogous form of duality relation for multi slit experiments has generated quite a lot of research activity .",
    "several attempts have been made to explore it quantatively@xcite .",
    "the simplest multi slit case is the three slit case , recently , a duality relation for three slit interference has been formulated @xcite , a step towards the search for an analogous form of duality relation for more than two slits . the analysis for four or",
    "multi slit interference is much more involved than that for two or three slit experiments , there it would be difficult to find phases for which extreme intensities occur , and thus the visibility .",
    "of late , a focussed interest has been generated towards the three - slit experiments@xcite .",
    "three - slits are also used in generating qutrit states , their applications include implementation of quantum games@xcite and in quantum tomography@xcite .    in this paper , we propose and theoretically analyze a three - slit ghost interference experiment performed with entangled particles . also a _ nonlocal _",
    "duality relation is derived which connects the path distinguishability of one particle to the interference visibility of the other .",
    "our analysis is general enough to describe any two entangled particles .",
    "it equally well applies to entangled photons , whether generated by _ spdc _ or any other method like _ four - wave mixing_.",
    "in our proposed experiment , the _ two slits _ are replaced by _ three slits _ , in the earlier setup ( see fig . [ 3ghostexpt ] ) .",
    "the entangled photons 1 and 2 from the source s show an interference pattern , similar to the pattern observed from three slits experiment . even though photon 2 never passes through the region between the source s and three slits",
    ", we see an interference pattern for photon 2 , as if a beam of photon 2 with a source located at the position of detector @xmath0 , get split by three - slits .",
    "this behavior can be qualitatively understood with the help of an advanced wave picture introduced by klyshko@xcite . in this picture",
    ", the detector @xmath0 plays the role of a source , which sends photon back towards the crystal .",
    "these photons are then reflected by the crystal as by mirror , compels them to follow the path of the signal photons , detected by the detector @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", the increase in spatial filtering of the detector @xmath0 , reduces the size of the source in the advanced wave picture , which increases the spatial coherence . in the following we do a more quantitative analysis .",
    "our view is that the ghost interference@xcite is a result of position and momentum entanglement in photon pairs .",
    "same phenomenon should be observed for any two entangled particles .",
    "spdc is just one method of producing entangled particles .",
    "we will base our analysis on entangled pairs of particles . in order to theoretically analyze the entangled photons ,",
    "a generalized epr state@xcite is used , which unlike the epr state@xcite , is well behaved and fully normalized .",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normalization constant , and @xmath4 are certain parameters whose physical significance will become clear in the following . in the limit @xmath5 the state ( [ state ] ) reduces to the epr state .    the pair of photons are assumed to travel in opposite directions along the x - axis , and the entanglement is in the z - direction .",
    "we will ignore the dynamics along the x - axis as it does not affect the entanglement .",
    "we assume that during the evolution for time @xmath6 , the photon travels a distance equal to @xmath7 .",
    "integration performed over @xmath8 in eq.([state ] ) gives : @xmath9 the uncertainty in positions and the wave - vector of two photons , along the z - axis , is given by @xmath10 the above equation gives the position and momentum spread of the photons in the z - direction .",
    "the time evolution of wave - function is essentially dictated by time evolution of wave - packet .    if the wave - function of a single photon at time @xmath11 is @xmath12 , then the wave - function of photon , after time t will evolve as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fourier transform of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath15 .    in the above equation ,",
    "if @xmath16 , then it would be monochromatic approximation .",
    "but we have applied an alternative approach .",
    "the photon approximately travels in the x - direction , but can slightly deviate in the z - direction , so it can pass through slits which are located at different z - positions , and therefore its true wave - vector will be given by , @xmath17 since the photon travel along x - axis , hence for @xmath18 , one can write @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the wave - number of the photon associated with its wavelength , @xmath21 . the dispersion along z - axis can be approximated by @xmath22 the above relation can also be obtained using paraxial approximation , for small angle @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .    using ( [ ps ] ) , the eq.([psitl ] )",
    "becomes @xmath26    in case of entangled photons , after time @xmath27 , photon 1 reaches the triple slit ( @xmath28 ) , and photon 2 travels a distance @xmath29 towards detector @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the wave - function of the entangled photons after time @xmath27 is given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the fourier transform of ( [ psi0 ] ) with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "to investigate the effect on the entangled state , one can use two different approaches .",
    "the first , most obvious is to model a potential for three - slits , and calculate its evolution in that potential .",
    "we will follow the second , a comparatively easier approach , here we capture the essence of the effect of triple slit on the wave - function , without going into tedious calculations .",
    "when the state interacts with a single - slit , we assume , that a gaussian wave - packet emerges from that slit , centered at its location , whose width is related to the width of the slit .    consider the state of particle 1 passing through the slits a , b and c be @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "some part of the state of particle 1 will be blocked , represented by @xmath36 .",
    "all these states are orthogonal , and the actual state of particle 1 can be expanded in this basis .",
    "@xmath37 are states of particle 2 and can be written explicitly as follows .",
    "latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath75    visibility of the interference fringes is conventionally defined as@xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 represent the maximum and minimum intensity in neighbouring fringes , respectively .",
    "maxima and minima of ( [ peter ] ) will occur at points where the value of each cosine is 1 and -1/2 , respectively , provided we ignore @xmath101 term .",
    "if we look at any fringe , other than the central one , @xmath102 , and hence can be ignored in comparison .    the visibility of particle 2",
    "can then be written down as @xmath103    where ,  @xmath104,$ ]  and + @xmath105 + 2 \\exp[-{z_0 ^ 2\\zeta } ] \\cosh[\\frac{4 z_2 z_0 } { \\gamma_d^2 } ] \\right)$ ] ,    the maximum visibility one can theoretically get when @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the actual fringe visibility will be less than or equal to that , and can be written as @xmath108 using ( [ d ] ) , the above equation gives @xmath109    the duality relation ( [ duality ] ) , is very similar to the duality relation derived earlier for a three - slit interference experiment@xcite .",
    "the big difference is that , in three - slit experiment we talk of the path distinguishability and the fringe visibilty for the same particle . in three - slit ghost interference , we show that the relation is between different particles , i.e the path distinguishability of particle 1 is related with the fringe visibilty of particle 2 .",
    "if instead of triple slit , a double slit were kept in the path , the path distinguishability of particle 1 and the fringe visibilty of particle 2 , will follow a different duality relation , given by @xmath110 .",
    "this can be inferred by relating @xmath111 with distinguishability used in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the complementarity between which - way information and interference fringe visibility for the ghost interference , for entangled photons passing through three slits .",
    "we also derive a three - slit nonlocal duality relation which connects the path distinguishability of one photon to the interference visibility of the other which means erasing the which - path information of photon 1 recovers the interference pattern of photon 2 and vice - versa .",
