    "<S> we consider an excitatory population of subthreshold izhikevich neurons which exhibit noise - induced firings . by varying the coupling strength @xmath0 , we investigate population synchronization between the noise - induced firings which may be used for efficient cognitive processing such as sensory perception , multisensory binding , selective attention , and memory formation . as @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is increased , rich types of population synchronization ( e.g. , spike , burst , and fast spike synchronization ) are found to occur . transitions between population synchronization and incoherence are well described in terms of an order parameter @xmath1 . as a final step , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling induces oscillator death ( quenching of noise - induced spikings ) because each neuron is attracted to a noisy equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillator death leads to a transition from firing to non - firing states at the population level , which may be well described in terms of the time - averaged population spike rate @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the statistical - mechanical analysis using @xmath1 and @xmath2 , each population and individual state are also characterized by using the techniques of nonlinear dynamics such as the raster plot of neural spikes , the time series of the membrane potential , and the phase portrait . </S>",
    "<S> we note that population synchronization of noise - induced firings may lead to emergence of synchronous brain rhythms in a noisy environment , associated with diverse cognitive functions . </S>"
