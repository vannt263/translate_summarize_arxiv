    "conserved vector current ( cvc ) and partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypotheses , using the electron scattering data and assuming a dipole form of the axial form factor , the weak transition matrix element contains only one unknown parameter , the axial mass @xmath5 .",
    "recent neutrino ccqe cross section measurements , notably the high statistics muon double differential cross section results from the miniboone ( mb ) experiment @xcite , suggest @xmath5 values significantly larger than estimations from the older deuteron target neutrino measurements and from the pion electro - production data @xcite .",
    "it is becoming clear that in order to understand correctly the mb data , a two body current contribution to the cross section must be considered @xcite . in the experimental event identification",
    "this contribution can easily be confused with the genuine ccqe events .",
    "the older and recent ccqe @xmath5 estimates can be consistent , because in the case of the neutrino - deuteron scattering the two body current contribution is small @xcite .",
    "theoretical models of the two body current contribution ( called in this paper also n - particles n - holes ( @xmath6 ) ) give quite different estimates of the size of the effect both for neutrino and antineutrino scattering .",
    "recently the mb collaboration published the first large statistics antineutrino ccqe - like ( a sum of ccqe and @xmath6 contributions ) cross section results @xcite .",
    "the data has been already analysed by the theoretical groups @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a ratio of the ccqe - like cross sections for neutrinos and antineutrinos was discussed as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "if the errors become smaller , this kind of data can allow to discriminate the models .",
    "it is important to look also for alternative ways to evaluate @xmath5 and/or investigate the size of the two body current contribution .",
    "the minerva collaboration analysed the energy deposit near ccqe - like interaction vertex looking for an evidence for multinucleon knock - out events @xcite .",
    "another option is to look at the neutral current elastic ( ncel ) reaction : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes proton or neutron . as it will be explained in detail in sect .",
    "[ ncel ] the basic theoretical framework to investigate ncel scattering is similar to the one used for ccqe .",
    "the neutral current nc hadronic current is expressed in terms of the vector and axial form factors , that are linear combinations of the form factors present in the ccqe reaction with an addition of new terms sensitive to the strange quark content of nucleons .",
    "thus , the ncel scattering data allows for extraction of both @xmath5 and the strange quark contribution to the form factors .",
    "in fact , most of the interest in the ncel reaction comes from its potential to measure the strangeness of the nucleon .",
    "the axial strange form factor can be determined from the ncel neutrino-@xmath9 scattering data because it enters proton and neutron matrix elements with opposite signs .",
    "typically , in experiments , one tries to extract @xmath10 , a value of the axial strange form factor at @xmath11 .",
    "it corresponds to the fraction of strange quarks and antiquarks that contribute to the total proton spin , commonly denoted as @xmath12 .",

    "about three years ago the mb collaboration measured the flux averaged ncel differential cross section on the @xmath9 target @xcite .",
    "two observables were considered .",
    "the first one is the distribution of events in the total reconstructed kinetic energy of the final state nucleons . the measurement is based on the mb detector ability to analyse the scintillation light in the absence of cherenkov light from the final state muon . in the second observable a proton enriched sample of events",
    "is analysed with the kinetic energies above the cherenkov radiation threshold . the observable",
    "is defined as the ratio of the cross section for the proton enriched sample to the total ncel - like ( events with no pions in the final state ) cross section .",
    "the mb collaboration made two separate parameter extractions . assuming @xmath15 the value of @xmath16  gev was obtained from the first observable .",
    "taking the value @xmath17  gev from the ccqe analysis @xcite , mb found @xmath18 from the proton enriched sample of events .",
    "the description of both data samples in terms of @xmath19  gev and @xmath20 is consistent .",

    "@xcite , with the conclusion that the shape of the mb measured distribution of events in @xmath24 is reproduced with @xmath25  gev . however , there is a @xmath26 discrepancy in the overall normalisation with the mb results ( the measured cross section is larger ) .",
    "meucci , gusti and pacati analysed the predictions of four nuclear models @xcite .",

    "nuwro describes the neutral current @xmath6 contribution with the effective transverse enhancement ( te ) model @xcite .",
    "the te model provides the contribution to the neutrino inclusive cross section and predictions for the final state nucleons are obtained with a procedure described in ref .",
    "the advantage of the te model is that it can be safely used for neutrinos of energies larger than @xmath27  gev . in this paper",
    "only nucleons resulting from the @xmath6 events will be analysed and differences between microscopic ( see refs .",

    "another important difference with respect to the previous studies of the mb ncel data is in the treatment of nuclear effects .",
    "we will compare nuwro predictions to the quantities ( visible energy ) that are directly observable and we will not rely on the nuance fsi model .    our main result is a simultaneous fit to the @xmath5 and @xmath29 done using the mb data for the distribution of events in the total reconstructed kinetic energy of the final state nucleons , with the outcome : @xmath30  gev and @xmath2 .",
    "we will argue that the second mb observable is very sensitive to details of fsi and the @xmath6 kinematics model and it is very difficult to use it as a reliable source of an information about theoretical model parameters . on the contrary ,",

    "as we focus on the sum of the kinetic energies of all the nucleons in the final state , the result is not much sensitive to the assumptions made on the @xmath6 kinematics described in sec [ sec : mec ] .    our predictions for the ratio @xmath123 obtained with the values @xmath151 and @xmath152 together with the contributions to the numerator coming from various signal events",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds_bf ] .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : nucmodel ] the formation zone for the @xmath6 events is assumed to be zero , because there is no clear physical motivation to introduce it . in order to estimate how important the fz effect can be for the ncel analysis we repeated the computations assuming the fz for the @xmath6 events to be @xmath3  fm .",
    "it turned out that this assumption does not affect the final results in a statistically relevant way .",
    "we investigated the impact of the uncertainty of the value of the parameter @xmath155 defining a relative abundance of @xmath91 and @xmath156 pairs on which two body current scattering occur .",
    "the default value of @xmath155 is @xmath157 and we repeated the computations with the value @xmath158 .",
    "no influence on the final results was found .",
    "the impact of the two body current events on the analysis of the mb data for the neutrino ncel scattering on @xmath0 was investigated in detail .",
    "this is the first analysis of this kind yet .",
    "we performed a simultaneous fit to two theoretical model parameters and obtained the values @xmath30  gev and @xmath2 .",
    "our results provide a new evidence that large axial mass measurements can be explained by the two - body current contribution to the cross section neglected in the experimental data analysis",
    ".    it would be interesting to repeat this analysis using one of the microscopic models of the nc two body current contribution . also , it is desirable to include other nuclear effects like random phase approximation ( rpa ) correlations .",
    "as mentioned above , nuwro contains implementations of ific and martini et al .",
    "models for @xmath6 in the cc channel only . recently using the theoretical computations from @xcite nuwro was upgraded with the implementation of rpa , but again only for the cc reactions .",
    "we are planning to include @xmath6 dynamics and the rpa effects for nc channels but it requires a significant amount of theoretical and programming work . for the rpa an appropriate recalculation of the components of the polarisation tensor is needed as in the relativistic formalism adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite the response functions are calculated in the analytical form .",
    "recently the miniboone collaboration made public the preliminary results from the antineutrino ncel analysis @xcite .",
    "they are supplementary to those discussed in this paper .",
    "when the data become available a combined analysis will have more potential to investigate the @xmath6 contribution and put more constraints on the @xmath29 value .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : npnh ] the mb proton enriched distribution of events contains an important information about hadrons resulting from @xmath6 events not explored in this study . in order to make use of this information a very good control over the fsi effects is required .",
    "finally , we would like to notice that there is an interesting idea for an alternative measurement of the ncel cross section described in ref .",
    "the authors investigate the relation between the rate of the observed @xmath159 rays coming from nuclear deexcitation in water - cherenkov detectors and the ncel cross section .",
