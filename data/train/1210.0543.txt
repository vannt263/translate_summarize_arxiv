    "constraints on the stellar content of galaxies are often derived from multiwavelength observations by assuming that the star formation history ( sfh ) of an individual galaxy can be approximated by a simple declining exponential function of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the galaxy age and @xmath4 the star formation timescale .",
    "@xmath4-models \" have been used successfully to estimate , for example , the stellar masses of nearby spiral galaxies from fits of rest - frame optical / near - infrared colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite this success ,",
    "an increasing number of analyses have pointed out the limitations of @xmath4-models , particularly for applications to studies of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this is the case of lyman - break galaxies at redshifts @xmath5 ( @xcite ) and blue star - forming galaxies at @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , for which the addition of another stellar component on top of a @xmath4-model can change the derived stellar masses by a factor of several .",
    "in fact , the major episodes of star formation in ultraviolet ( uv)-luminous lyman - break galaxies could last only a few hundred million years ( @xcite ) .",
    "reddy et al . ( 2012 ) also find that , for galaxies at @xmath7 , fits of broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) using exponentially declining sfhs produce on average star formation rates ( sfrs ) 5 to 10 times lower than those inferred from more direct estimates based on the combined analysis of uv and mid - infrared emission .",
    "they conclude that sfhs in which the sfr rises with time are more appropriate than declining @xmath4-models for these galaxies .",
    "this is reinforced by the conclusions of maraston et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and pforr et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that sed fits of galaxies at @xmath6 using declining @xmath4-models produce unrealistically low ages , and that exponentially _ rising _",
    "@xmath4-models should be preferred for these galaxies .",
    "in fact , simulations of galaxy formation in a hierarchical universe predict complex , stochastic sfhs of individual galaxies , which are not well approximated by simple declining exponential laws ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to better characterize the sfhs of galaxies at moderate and high redshift , we require more sophisticated , physically motivated spectral analysis tools . in this letter",
    ", we achieve this goal by appealing to the approach recently proposed by pacifici et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to constrain the sfhs of 4517 galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , we fit the observed broadband seds and emission - line strengths of these galaxies using a comprehensive library of synthetic spectra .",
    "we assemble this library by combining state - of - the - art models of stellar population synthesis , nebular emission , and attenuation by dust with star formation and chemical enrichment histories derived from the semi - analytic post - treatment of a large - scale cosmological simulation .",
    "this approach allows us to characterize the sfhs of galaxies in different mass and redshift ranges in a physically motivated and statistically reliable manner , using realistic , hierarchical mass - assembly histories .",
    "the resulting best - estimate sfhs differ significantly from simple exponentially declining laws , and the dispersion about the average sfh in any mass and redshift range can be quite large .    the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] , we present observations of the _",

    "we report our results in  [ sec : results ] and present our conclusions in  [ sec : concl ] . throughout this letter ,",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and a chabrier initial mass function ( @xcite ) .",
    "to explore the sfhs of galaxies in wide ranges of stellar mass and sfr at different cosmic epochs , we appeal to the aegis survey .",
    "this combines photometric and spectroscopic observations of the extended groth strip at wavelengths over the whole range from x - ray to radio . in this initial analysis",
    ", we restrict ourselves to optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "this is because multiband observations at wavelengths spanning from blue - ward the 4000 break out to the rest - frame _ i_-band set valuable constraints on a galaxy s sfh , while spectroscopically measured emission lines are required for solid redshift determinations and precise sfr estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from the aegis catalog ,",

    "we use the recently developed spectral analysis tool of pacifici et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to derive optimal constraints on the sfhs and stellar masses of the galaxies in the sample described above .",

    "we draw only 100,000 galaxy sfhs from @xmath20 to the present time . by analogy with pacifici et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we broaden the parameter space by redrawing , for each selected sfh , 10 different combinations of the following parameters : redshift of observation ( in the range @xmath21 ) ; evolutionary stage ( see sections  2.1 and 3.1.2 in @xcite ) ; _ current _",
    "( i.e. , averaged over a period of 10 myr before the galaxy is observed ) specific sfr ( @xmath22 ) ; and current gas - phase oxygen abundance ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we generate a library of 1 million galaxy seds by combining this library of star formation and chemical enrichment histories with the latest version of the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population synthesis models , the galaxy nebular emission model of charlot & longhetti ( 2001 ) ( based on the photoionization code cloudy ; @xcite ) , and the 2-component dust model of charlot & fall ( 2000 ) .",
    "we take the same probability distribution of the total optical depth of the dust ( @xmath24 ) as in pacifici et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , but with an upper limit of @xmath25 ( instead of 4 ) which is more appropriate for the current sample of blue star - forming galaxies .",
    "we also draw randomly the slope of the attenuation curve in the interstellar medium in the range 0.41.1 .",
    "this procedure allows us to go beyond the typical approach of using simple idealized functions at fixed metallicity to describe the sfhs of galaxies .",
    "a potential drawback is that the star formation and chemical enrichment prescriptions are drawn from a specific semi - analytic model .",
    "our resampling of the library , as described above , minimizes the impact of this choice .",

    "the exact lines fitted depend on the rest - frame wavelength coverage of the spectra , as listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",

    "we find that virtually identical average sfhs are obtained when selecting the second or third best - fit sfh for each galaxy .",
    "the sfr of low - mass galaxies ( figure  [ fig : sfhlow ] ) increases steadily from early times to the epoch of observation , while that of high - mass galaxies ( figure  [ fig : sfhhigh ] ) first rises and then declines in a _ bell - shaped _ manner .",

    "in fact , as shown by figures  [ fig : sfhlow ] and [ fig : sfhhigh ] themselves , there is a significant dispersion in the sfhs of individual galaxies .",
    "it is of interest to note that the average sfhs of the galaxies in our sample can be approximated by `` delayed @xmath4-models '' ( @xcite ) of the type @xmath61 , with @xmath4 spanning the range from 0.2 to 1.0 ( from high to low redshift ) for the high - mass galaxies and from 0.4 to 3.0 for the low - mass ones .",
    "the exponent @xmath62 defines the ratio of the time of maximum sfr to the star formation timescale ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "of course , fluctuations arising from the specific merger history of any individual galaxy will make it deviate from the average sfh ( figure  [ fig : track ] ) .    from the best - fit sfhs extracted for each galaxy in our analysis ,",
