    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite is observed around rational filling factors with odd denominators in the lowest landau level .",
    "this effect is caused by the formation of the incompressible liquid state @xcite .",
    "recent experiments showed that the compressible state around the half - filled lowest landau level is similar to the fermi liquid . in the composite fermion theory@xcite , this fermi - liquid - like state",
    "is described by the composite of an electron and two flux quanta , which behaves like a free electron with no magnetic field in the mean field approximation .    in the second landau level ,",
    "the situation dramatically changes ; the fqhe is observed around the half - filling@xcite .",
    "the origin of this quantum hall state is still mysterious .",
    "recent numerical works@xcite seem to support the pfaffian state @xcite , which has the spin - polarized p - wave pairing potential , rather than the spin - singlet paired state@xcite .",
    "however the microscopic explanation for this pairing mechanism is not known yet .",
    "more quantitative search is , therefore , needed on the basis of the microscopic bcs - like model . in the present paper , we study the paired state in the mean field theory starting from a microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "it was shown that the fermi - liquid - like state@xcite can be constructed at an arbitrary filling factor in the von neumann lattice formalism@xcite . in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the free kinetic energy is quenched and the kinetic energy is generated from the coulomb interaction . if the translational symmetry on the von neumann lattice and u(1 ) symmetry are unbroken , the fermi surface is formed in the magnetic brillouin zone in the mean field theory . in the hartree - fock approximation",
    ", this state corresponds to the striped state@xcite which is observed at half - filled second and higher landau levels@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first order transition from striped state to paired state is obtained in the numerical calculation of small systems .",

    "the hopping potential @xmath0 and gap potential @xmath1 are determined self - consistently in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation .",
    "naively it seems that the formation of the paired state by only the repulsive force is impossible in the mean field theory .",
    "however , screening effect could make the potential attractive for the pairing .",
    "in fact , the quantum effect of fermion loop screens the coulomb potential and the pseudopotential in the landau level space becomes attractive .",
    "depending on strength of the screening effect , there are two phases , that is , stripe phase and pairing phase . on the basis of this observation",
    ", we construct an effective hamiltonian which shows a transition from the striped state to the paired state .",
    "the transition is continuous and very smooth .",
    "the energy spectrum of the quasiparticle is obtained and energy gap is calculated numerically .",
