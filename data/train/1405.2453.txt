    "sphere packing problems are equivalent to important problems in number theory and error - correcting coding @xcite , both of which are fundamental in computer science . despite its importance , analytical developments in granular matter have lagged behind in comparison with other fields of condensed matter , like liquid theory . in the case of random packings",
    "@xcite , analytical results are still difficult to obtain .",
    "the theoretical difficulty arises due to _ (",
    "i ) _ the absence of a first principle derivation of the statistical ensemble of packings ( such as liouville s theorem in ordinary liquids ) that would lead to a proper definition of randomness @xcite , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the existence of correlations between the particle positions determining the properties of random packings .    in previous theories ,",
    "these correlations have been neglected or treated using simple approximations .",
    "for instance , gotoh and finney @xcite estimated the density of rcp based only on correlations among the contact neighbors .",

    "within the context of edwards statistical ensemble of packings @xcite , the volume associated to each particle plays the role of the hamiltonian , since packings tend to minimize the occupied volume rather than energy . the fundamental quantity to describe",
    "the packing ensemble is the voronoi volume surrounding each particle , which is defined as the volume of the voronoi cell whose interior consists of the points that are closer to a given particle than to any other .",
    "the @xmath3-dimensional voronoi volume @xmath4 of particle @xmath5 is an angular average of a function of the  voronoi radius \" @xmath6 @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system]a ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath3-dimensional solid angle . by the definition of voronoi cell , @xmath6 is the minimum of the projection of the distance @xmath9 ( from particle @xmath5 to any other particle @xmath10 ) along the direction @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( fig .",

    "each particle as well as each direction is equivalent . thus @xmath6 is independent of particle @xmath5 and direction @xmath11 : @xmath17 equation  ( [ eq : we ] ) shows that it is enough to consider the distributions of particle positions along any arbitrary direction around any arbitrary particle , and the result is representative for the global properties of the entire packing .",
    "this feature of random packings significantly simplifies the problem .",
    "furthermore , this ensemble average can be calculated from distribution functions : @xmath18 and the packing fraction @xmath19 is the ratio between the volume of spheres @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the probability distribution function of @xmath6 in the ensemble , and @xmath22 is the inverse cumulative distribution function : @xmath23 .",

    "the voronoi particles are located on the two closest branches to the direction @xmath11 , but in higher dimensions more branches should be considered .",
    "the positions of the voronoi particles are described by the @xmath0-particle angular correlation function @xmath28 of exclusive angles .",
    "however , to calculate @xmath29 one needs to define a proper ensemble first .",
    "here we use the principle of entropy maximization which corresponds to a statistical treatment of an ensemble of all jammed states , each of which has an equal probability @xcite .",
    "this ensemble can be represented by a set of contact networks satisfying the jamming condition , while for a given contact network , particle positions are allowed to fluctuate without destroying the contacts .",
    "our approach defines a random packing as the typical state in a flat average over the ensemble of all possible graphs of contact network configurations constraint to a given average coordination number @xcite .",
    "mechanical force and torque balance is assured by the isostatic condition imposed on the coordination number @xcite .",
    "the network representation is a unique feature of packings compared to unjammed liquid systems . for contacting neighbors",
    ", we only need to know the distribution of the surface angles : the original @xmath3-dimensional problem is mapped onto a @xmath30-dimensional space .",
    "the theory is mathematically treatable in two limits : _",
    "( i ) _ in 2d , the one - dimensional surface space can be analyzed analytically ; _ ( ii ) _ in large dimensions , the contacting neighbors on the surface can be approximated to the simple ideal gas @xcite .",
    "below we apply the general formalism to study 2d random packings , where correlations are more profound .",
    "in this section , we apply the general formalism in 2d , and provide quantitative predictions which can be tested by experiments and computer simulations .",
    "the approach may be generalized to higher dimensions , although the calculations might become much more complicated .      by definition ,",
