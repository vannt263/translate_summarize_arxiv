    "<S> we find that , already with the currently available data , amanda and rice should be able to place sensible constraints in black hole production parameter space , which are competitive with the present ones from the air shower facilities fly s eye and agasa . in the optimistic case that a ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux significantly higher than the one expected from cosmic ray interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation is realized in nature , one even has discovery potential for black holes at neutrino telescopes beyond the reach of lhc .    </S>",

    "<S> one might expect the copious production of black holes in high energy collisions at cm energies above @xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , expected to have a first physics run in 2006 , may turn into a factory of black holes at which their production and evaporation may be studied in detail  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> black hole production and subsequent decay in the scattering of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the atmosphere may initiate quasi - horizontal air showers far above the standard model rate  @xcite and with distinct characteristics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reach of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite for extensive air showers , expected to be completed by the end of 2003 , in the black hole production parameter range has been thoroughly investigated in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that , depending on the size of the flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos , the first signs of black hole production may be observed at auger already before the start of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it was shown that already now sensible constraints on black hole production can be obtained from the non - observation of horizontal showers  @xcite by the fly s eye collaboration  @xcite and the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) collaboration  @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints turn out to be competitive with other currently available constraints on tev - scale gravity which are mainly based on interactions associated with kaluza - klein gravitons , according to which a fundamental planck scale as low as @xmath3 tev is still allowed for @xmath4 flat or @xmath5 warped extra dimensions  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",

    "<S> after briefly reviewing the phenomenological model of black hole production adopted , we calculate the rate expectation for events contained in the fiducial volume of a neutrino telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we then extend our calculations to rates from through - going muons . </S>",
