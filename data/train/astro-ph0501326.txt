    "black holes of mass @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 occupy a special niche in several subfields of theoretical astrophysics . such objects might naturally form as remnants of the first stars in the universe @xcite , or be built through merging of stars @xcite or stellar - mass black holes @xcite in young star clusters .",
    "these black holes may play critical roles in the formation and growth of supermassive ( @xmath4@xmath6 ) black holes in galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) have been invoked to resolve several recent observational quandaries .",
    "some of the `` ultraluminous '' x - ray sources detected in other galaxies may be accreting imbhs ( e.g , miller & colbert 2004 ) , although the majority are likely stellar - mass black holes @xcite . there have been recent claims of possible imbh detections in two globular clusters ( m15 in the milky way and g1 in m31 ) based on _ hst _ data @xcite .",
    "however , the data do not require imbhs , as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite cite evidence for a single or binary imbh in the cluster ngc  6752 based on the anomalous positions and accelerations of cluster radio pulsars .",
    "finally , a single or binary imbh could account for the net rotation observed in the center of m15 @xcite .    because of the broad scientific scope sampled by imbhs , it is crucial to investigate what unique dynamical signatures they imprint on their environments .",
    "the high stellar densities and proximities of galactic globular clusters make them prime locales to search for imbhs , as emphasized by much of the recent observational work ; for a review of early theoretical and observational studies , see @xcite . here",
    "we introduce a process that deposits stars directly into compact orbits ( e.g. , @xmath7100au ) around a massive cluster black hole .",
    "binary stars are abundant in globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a binary that passes sufficiently near a central black hole is disrupted by tidal forces , resulting in the capture of one star and ejection of the other ( see   [ sec : dyn ] ) .",
    "this type of interaction was studied in the context of sgr a@xmath8 by @xcite and @xcite as a mechanism for accelerating stars to very high speeds , and by @xcite to account for the young stars near sgr a@xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the disruption rate in globular clusters is estimated in   [ sec : binlc ] , and the fate of captured stars is discussed in   [ sec : clusdyn ] .",
    "future directions for studying this mechanism in more detail are suggested in ",

    "consider a binary system of mass @xmath9 with semimajor axis @xmath10 on a parabolic approach to a black hole of mass @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the distance between the binary barycenter and the black hole , and @xmath13 be the _ minimum _ distance .",
    "the differential acceleration across the binary ( @xmath0@xmath14 ) exceeds the binary self - gravity ( @xmath0@xmath15 ) within the tidal radius , @xmath16 where @xmath17 . for a disrupted binary ,",
    "the tidal perturbation is essentially impulsive , and the additional relative velocity imparted to the binary components has a magnitude of @xmath0@xmath18 . immediately following the disruption ,",
    "the two stars are mutually unbound and move relative to the black hole with the original systemic velocity of magnitude @xmath19 , plus contributions from the prior orbital motion and tidal perturbation .",
    "random orbital orientations and phases at the time of disruption lead to a range of orbital parameters and asymptotic speeds for stars that are captured or ejected ; below are estimates for the typical values .",
    "if star 1 is captured , we can estimate the expectation value of its specific energy , @xmath20 , relative to the black hole by assuming that its resultant velocity after the tidal perturbation is directed opposite to the binary systemic velocity and has a magnitude of @xmath21 . to leading order",
    ", we obtain @xmath22 the corresponding semimajor axis and orbital period are @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the binary period",

    "we now employ `` loss - cone '' theory to estimate the rate of binary disruptions .",
    "the approach taken here is not very rigorous , but captures the essential physics .",
    "more precise accounts of loss - cone dynamics can be found in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a binary with semimajor axis @xmath10 at radius @xmath32 is tidally disrupted if its specific angular momentum about the black hole is less than @xmath33 .",
    "if the local one - dimensional stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath34 , is adopted as a typical binary systemic speed , the disruption condition defines a double - sided loss cone in velocity space with semiangle @xmath35 .",
    "perturbations by distant stars cause the binary barycenter to undergo a random walk in phase space . in a dynamical time , @xmath36 ,",
    "the velocity is deflected by an angle @xmath37 , measured at radius @xmath12 .",

    "the ratio @xmath42 increases monotonically with @xmath12 for profiles @xmath39 and @xmath34 suitable to globular clusters .",
    "two loss - cone regimes are loosely demarcated by @xmath43 , defining a critical radius @xmath44 . for @xmath45",
    ", binaries can scatter into and out of the loss cone in a dynamical time , and the loss cone is full statistically . if @xmath46 , binaries within the loss cone are disrupted in a dynamical time , and the disruption rate is limited by the diffusion of binaries across the loss - cone boundary .",
    "we assume that the cluster center consists of a power - law density cusp around the black hole , embedded in an isothermal cluster core of radius @xmath47 .",
    "the cusp is inside the radius of influence of the central black hole : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the velocity dispersion at @xmath51 .",

    "the differential rate is @xmath68 the contribution from @xmath69 dominates , and we obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mean semimajor axis in au .    in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the fraction of binaries disrupted in a time @xmath72 is @xmath0@xmath73 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the lower limit in the above radial integral is relatively unimportant if it is @xmath76@xmath44 .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath77 a binary fraction of @xmath78 and mean semimajor axis of @xmath79 give disruption rates of @xmath0@xmath80 for both the full and diffusive regimes when @xmath81 .",
    "the total disruption rate is then @xmath0@xmath82@xmath83 for the same parameter values . for @xmath611au and @xmath84 ,",

    "each binary disruption by a @xmath66@xmath3 black hole deposits one star into a compact , eccentric keplerian orbit . in 100myr , @xmath010100 stars may be captured . however",
    ", a collection of @xmath410 stars orbiting the black hole with periods of @xmath710yr will not persist in the time between captures .",
    "mechanisms that drive the evolution of captured stars include gravitational and collisional two - body encounters , and tidal disruption by the black hole .",
    "these processes are quantified below , under the ad hoc simplifying assumptions that the stars have equal masses of @xmath41 , follow a power - law density profile with @xmath102 , and everywhere have a nearly isotropic velocity field .",
    "we neglect relatively weak and rare perturbative encounters between captured stars and cluster stars on highly elongated orbits @xcite .",

    "the relaxation time at @xmath104 is @xmath106 ( eq .  [ [ eq : relax ] ] with @xmath107 ) .",
    "`` resonant relaxation '' @xcite of a star s orbital angular momentum occurs on a shorter timescale of @xmath108 , driving the collection of captured stars toward velocity isotropy without affecting the energy distribution .",
    "if @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the orbits spread significantly in the radial direction in the time between captures .",
    "captured stars on the widest orbits will mingle with other ( non - captured ) stars within @xmath51 .",
    "the outward transport of captured stars into the cusp may noticeably alter the cusp structure .    a star may be unbound from the black hole following a single strong encounter ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . an upper limit to the ejection rate",
    "is obtained by setting the maximum two - body impact parameter to @xmath111 , characteristic of a @xmath0@xmath112 deflection but not necessarily an ejection .",
    "the local rate per star is @xmath0@xmath113 .",
    "integrating over all captured stars , we find a rate of @xmath7@xmath114 . for @xmath115 and @xmath116 ,",
    "most stars may be ejected in the time between captures . under the point - mass assumption",
    ", energy conservation demands that ejection and relaxation leave at least one star tightly bound to the black hole .",
    "when finite stellar radii are considered , two additional processes must be addressed .",
    "first , the ( non - resonant ) rate at which the black hole tidally disrupts captured stars is @xmath0@xmath117 , which is much more efficient than ejection at removing stars .",
    "resonant relaxation may increase the rate substantially , since angular momentum diffusion drives stars into the loss cone .",
    "note that if a considerable fraction ( e.g. , @xmath410% ) of the captured stars are ultimately disrupted by the hole , the implied rate may exceed the swallowing rate for single stars determined by previous authors ( @xmath0@xmath118 for @xmath119 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the collision rate for stars of radius @xmath120 is @xmath0@xmath121@xmath122 for @xmath12350au .",
    "a collision between two main - sequence stars will result in coalescence unless the relative speed at infinity is significantly larger than the escape speed from the stellar surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which may occur within @xmath01au of a @xmath3 black hole .    when @xmath110 and @xmath109 , all of the above processes act on timescales shorter than or comparable to the time between stellar captures .",
    "thus , at any time , only a few stars are expected to orbit the black hole with periods of @xmath710yr .",
    "a @xmath3 black hole at the center of a globular cluster may tidally disrupt _ thousands _ of binaries over 10gyr , each encounter leaving one star within @xmath0100au of the hole . at any given time",
    ", the number of stars in such compact orbits is probably only a few , limited by interactions between captured stars and tidal disruption .",
    "before we can assess possible observational consequences of these processes , numerical simulations are required to properly calculate the binary disruption rate and the dynamical evolution of captured stars .",
    "the cluster evolution codes of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* monte carlo ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gas - dynamical / monte carlo ) are well suited to the problem of determining the binary disruption rate .",
    "these codes efficiently treat a realistic number ( @xmath4@xmath124 ) of stars and binaries , and include explicit integration of close binary - single and binary - binary encounters",
    ". the black hole would be represented by a central point mass , as in @xcite , but the imposed spherical symmetry demands that it be fixed at the origin , neglecting its brownian motion .",
    "these algorithms can not adequately follow the dynamics of a small-@xmath103 system of captured stars .",
    "direct @xmath103-body integration has been used to study the dynamics of single stars near a massive black hole @xcite .",
    "such simulations are prohibitively time - consuming when @xmath125 and there is a sizable binary fraction .",
    "simulations with @xmath126 may be of value , since the dynamics of captured stars are computed correctly .",
    "it may also be useful to follow the collisional @xmath103-body evolution @xmath010 captured stars in isolation from the cluster .",
    "if , following a stellar tidal disruption , @xmath66@xmath127 is accreted by the black hole with a 10% mass - to - light conversion efficiency , the duration of the eddington - limited flare is @xmath0@xmath128 .",
    "such a flare might be visible as a very bright uv / x - ray source in one of the @xmath0100 globular clusters in the milky way if most contain a @xmath66@xmath3 black hole that disrupts stars at a rate of @xmath0@xmath83 ; but we do not , and both suppositions may be highly optimistic .",
    "if the orbit of a captured star with a pericenter distance of @xmath66@xmath129 circularizes without the star being destroyed , stellar evolution may drive a long ( @xmath4@xmath130 ) phase of mass transfer , with accretion rates of @xmath7@xmath131 and luminosities of @xmath7@xmath132 @xcite .",
    "steady mass transfer from a @xmath4@xmath133 donor has been proposed as a fuel source for ultraluminous x - ray sources in young star clusters .",
    "hundreds of cluster neutron stars may acquire binary companions dynamically , accrete mass , and ultimately turn on as millisecond radio pulsars .",
