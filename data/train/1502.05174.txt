    "before discussing many - body interactions between disks rotating with an angular frequency @xmath0 , first we describe the behaviour of a dilute limit : behaviours of a single rotating disk and a pair of rotating disks ( supplementary fig . 1 and supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "we characterize the rotation speed of a disk either by the angular frequency @xmath0 or the relevant reynolds number @xmath1 ( @xmath2 : density ; @xmath3 : particle radius : @xmath4 : liquid viscosity ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1]a and b show the 2d flow field around a rotating disk and the velocity distribution , respectively .",
    "the latter shows that the rotating velocity linearly increases with the distance from the centre of mass , @xmath5 , inside a disk and decays as @xmath6 in its outside .",
    "this is the characteristic of the so - called rankin vortex , i.e. , a forced vortex in the central core surrounded by a free vortex .",
    "we note that the rankin vortex is known to mimic the 2d flow field of tornado and hurricane @xcite . for two co - rotating ` point ' vortexes ,",
    "the analytical solution is known and the two particles rotate around their center of mass towards the same direction as the rotating direction @xcite . in this case , the radius of rotation is the half of the initial interparticle distance . for particles with a finite size , on the other hand , the direction of rotation and the rotation center are the same as the case of point particles , but the radius of the rotation decreases with an increase in the rotation speed of the particles @xmath0 , or @xmath7 .",
    "this problem has a similarity to viscous interactions of co - rotating vortices @xcite , but the crucial difference arises from the fact that the vortex core is an undeformable solid and not a liquid in our case .",
    "there are a few studies on spinning particles in three dimensions @xcite ; however , we note that there is an essential difference between 2d and 3d problems ( supplementary figure 2 and supplenetary note 2 ) .",
    "we confirm that if we fix the centres of mass of two rotating particles on a fixed line , they always repel with each other by the magnus force @xcite .",
    "the attraction between particles is thus due to interparticle hydrodynamic interactions , as schematically explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c .",
    "the flow field generated by a rotating disk makes the other disk follow it , and vice versa .",
    "thus , two particles try to follow each other while rotating around the centre of mass of the pair . in 3d ,",
    "on the other hand , such hydrodynamic interactions are weaken due to the presence of the escape dimension , thus the magnus force wins over the hydrodynamic attractive force , and particles repel with each other . in 2d",
    ", this hydrodynamic attraction overwhelms the repulsion due to the magnus force , which leads to the rotating pair of particles ( fig .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] e ) , as long as the area fraction of disks , @xmath8 , is sufficiently small .",
    "however , it should be noted that this situation is realized in a periodic boundary condition . in relation to the above dimensionality effect on hydrodynamic interactions between rotors , it is worth noting that the hexagonal ordering observed by grzybowski et al.@xcite at finite reynolds numbers is due to the effective hydrodynamic repulsion between the disks floating at an interface in three dimensions ( _ i.e. _ , 2.5 dimensions ) .    .",

    "however , this cluster state becomes unstable , since the repulsive magnus force of nonlinear origin eventually wins over the hydrodynamic attraction for high @xmath7 ( see below ) . above a critical @xmath8 ( @xmath15 ) , on the other hand , a system exhibits a re - entrant transition between states as a function of @xmath0 ( fig .",

    "here we analyse a point pattern to extract the nature of interparticle interactions .",
    "the point pattern analysis is very useful to determine the overall interparticle interactions @xcite .",
    "here we use what we call @xmath25 function , which is the number of connected regions as a function of the radius of circle whose centre is located at the centre of each disk .",
    "the number of connected regions decreases monotonically , with an increase in the circle radius , from the total number of disks @xmath26 to one .",

    "for a system of particles with repulsive interactions , particles form a rather regular pattern and @xmath25 decays slower than that for the corresponding poisson pattern . for a system of particles with attractive interactions , on the other hand , particles form a cluster pattern and",
    "@xmath25 decays faster than that for the corresponding poisson pattern . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a , we show the @xmath25 function for @xmath13 .",
    "we can clearly see that for the cluster - forming case at @xmath27 the interaction is attractive whereas for the disordered state at @xmath28 the interaction is repulsive . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b , we show the @xmath25 function for @xmath29 .",
    "we can see that for all the value of @xmath7 the interaction is basically repulsive , but its strength is maximum at @xmath30 , for which the hexatic order is formed .",
    "the transition can be seen even more clearly by the degree of localization of the flow field : for a hexatic state each particle has its own localized rotational flow field , whereas for a cluster state a single vortex is always formed and thus the flow field is strongly delocalized .",
    "however , the precise nature of the cluster - hexatic phase transition , such as whether the transition is continuous or discontinuous and whether a disorder state always exists between the two states or there exists a critical point between the cluster and the hexatic state , is not clear at this moment . to access this problem",
    ", we need to survey the border region of a bigger system size with a high resolution of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "although this is a very interesting problem , we leave this for future investigation .",
    "we also find that the hexatic state is eventually destabilized and melts by a further increase in @xmath0 and a system becomes disordered again .",
    "we note that for all these states interparticle interactions are basically repulsive , unlike the case of low @xmath8 .",
    "although the torque exerted to each disk is exactly the same , the rotation speed of a disk can in principle depend on the particle configuration around it . here",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] the normalized variance of the angular frequency @xmath0 of rotating disks as a function of the averaged @xmath0 . for",
    "ordered states , the variance , i.e. , the fluctuations of rotation speed , becomes very small , indicating all the disks rotating with almost the same frequency .",
    "for disordered states , on the other hand , the variance is large , reflecting the large fluctuations of particle environment .",
    "this result indicates a strong negative correlation between the degree of fluctuations of rotational speed of particles and the degree of order    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c , we show the @xmath0-dependence of the hexatic order parameter @xmath20 , which clearly indicates the re - entrant nature of the state transitions .",
    "the transitions can also be characterized by the magnitude of fluctuations of @xmath20 , or the susceptibility ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]d ) , which is also observed in a thermodynamic hexatic ordering in 2d disks . in the hexatic",
    "ordered state , we confirm the power law decay of the spatial correlation of the hexatic order which is specific to the hexatic phase ( see fig . [ fig : fig2]e and f ) .",
    "we do not see any indication of the positional order since the radial distribution function decays almost exponentially ( see below ) .    here",
    "we show a hexatic phase observed in a large system ( lattice size=2048@xmath31 and the number of particles=5120 ) at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we can see grain boundaries between hexatic order with different orientations in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]a and b. figure [ fig : fig6]a and b show the decay of the correlation function of the hexatic order normalized by the radial distribution function @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and that of @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we can see @xmath24 decays algebraically in a short distance @xmath33 , but decays faster for long distance .",
    "this is because the size of mono - domain regions is finite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]a and b ) . on the other hand",
    ", we can see that @xmath22 decays faster than an algebraic decay even for @xmath33 , where @xmath24 decays algebraically .",
    "this clearly indicates the absence of quasi - long - range translational order in the ordered phase .",
    "thus we conclude that the ordered phase is the hexatic phase .",
    "the appearance of the transitions between dynamical states as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath0 in athermal systems is quite striking , which is reminiscent of phase transitions in a thermal system .",
    "we stress that the interparticle interaction in our system is of purely hydrodynamic origin .    here",
    "we consider a quite interesting feature of hydrodynamic interparticle interactions , which are absent in a thermal system .",
    "binary interaction potentials that lead to phase ordering in thermal systems always act along the interparticle axis , i.e. , along the line connecting the centres of mass of two interacting particles .",
    "however , this is not the case for our athermal system .",
    "the nonlinear magnus force acts along the line connecting two particles , whereas the stokes force acts according to the flow direction .",
    "furthermore , linear hydrodynamic interactions are tensorial and act not along the interparticle direction .",
    "thus , the total hydrodynamic force does not act along the interparticle axis .",
    "the direction of the hydrodynamic force as a function of @xmath7 is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b with a schematic explanation . with an increase in @xmath7 , both the magnus and the hydrodynamic force increase .",
    "however , the nonlinear magnus force increases more rapidly than the linear hydrodynamic force .",
    "thus , the direction of the total force , which is repulsive , approaches the interparticle axis .",
    "a strong enough repulsive force acting on particles not so far from the interparticle direction leads to the formation of hexatic order . to verify this scenario ,",
    "we have performed brownian dynamics simulation ( without hydrodynamic interactions ) by changing the angle @xmath17 between the direction of an artificial repulsive force and the interparticle direction .",
    "we find that when @xmath17 is continuously decreased , a system indeed forms hexatic order below a critical value of @xmath17 ( see the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b )",
    ".    next we discuss the nature of the translational motion of rotating disks in the disordered states . to see this",
    ", we calculate the mean - square displacement of disks @xmath34 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig7]a ) .",
    "interestingly , in the two types of disordered states particle motion is apparently diffusional : in the long - time limit we observe the relation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the effective diffusion constant and @xmath37 is the time duration . it should be noted that in our system there is no thermal noise and an isolated rotating disk exhibits no motion . for a pair of rotating particles , we also observe their trajectory is very stable and there is no fluctuation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]d )",
    ". thus , the apparently diffusional motion should be the consequence of self - generated force noise due to many - body hydrodynamic interactions of both linear and nonlinear origin .",
    "we can also see no diffusion , or non - ergodic behaviour , for the hexatic state .",
    "the random nature of fluctuations may be related to the long - range nature of hydrodynamic interactions , which makes a number of the surrounding particles affecting a particle large enough to provide strong _ stochastic _ spatio - temporal fluctuations .        for high @xmath7 ,",
    "the particle diffusion starts to become comparable or faster than momentum diffusion : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the momentum diffusion constant or the kinematic viscosity @xmath40 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig7]a and b ) .",
    "this implies that hydrodynamic interactions induced by the rotation of a particle can not fully propagate to its neighbouring particles for high @xmath7 .",
    "this weakens the repulsive interactions of particles and eventually leads to the melting of the hexatic state .",
    "thus the re - entrant hexatic ordering as a function of @xmath7 may be explained as follows : the increase of the magnus force of nonlinear origin with an increase in @xmath7 makes the direction of the interparticle force more aligned along the interparticle direction and also increases the strength of the repulsive force .",
    "this leads to stabilization of the hexatic order , as explained above .",
    "the ordered state is stable until the repulsive interaction is weakened by the intrinsically kinetic nature of hydrodynamic interactions : unlike ordinary interparticle interactions which propagate with the speed of light , hydrodynamic interactions propagate much slower in a diffusive manner with the momentum diffusion constant @xmath39 .",
    "this kinetic weakening of the repulsive force eventually destabilizes the hexatic state and leads to the melting into the disordered chaotic state .",
    "here we summarize what we observed in our system and show the state diagram as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]c ) .",
    "we can see the three states , i.e. , disordered fluid , cluster , and ordered hexatic state .",
    "it is quite striking that particles interacting by hydrodynamic interactions alone exhibit such rich phase behaviours .",
    "finally , we show other interesting states formed by rotating particles .",
    "the introduction of size polydispersity to hard spheres is known to lead to the formation of a glass state for a thermal system @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we introduce the polydispersity in the rotating speed of particles , whose variance is @xmath41 , and indeed find a non - ergodic glassy state of the rotating particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]a ) for high enough @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]b ) : liquid - glass transition in an athermal system . reflecting the nearly continuous nature of the liquid - to - hexatic transition @xcite ,",
    "there is no sharp transition from a hexatic to a disordered glassy state .",
    "although disks are rotating around their centres of mass , their positions are frozen in a disordered configuration and thus the system can be regarded as a nonergodic glassy state . here",
    "we show how the distribution of the rotation speed of particles leads to the loss of hexatic order and results in the formation of a glassy state . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9]a , the larger deviation from the averaged @xmath7 leads to the larger deviation from the average number of nearest neighbours ( = 6 ) . with an increase in the variance of the distribution @xmath41 ,",
    "more defects are produced and the hexatic order is eventually lost above @xmath42 .",
    "we can also see that the the interparticle distance is larger for a particle rotating with a faster speed because of stronger hydrodynamic repulsive force , i.e. , magnus force ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "both of these disorder effects are responsible for the formation of a glassy state : the number of the nearest neighbours and the average distance to the neighbours are both strongly correlated to the rotational speed of particles , which explains a wide enough distribution of the rotation speed results in the formation of a non - ergodic amorphous state instead of a hexatic ordered state .",
    "this glassy state is non - ergodic if we consider the particle configuration , yet maintains strong flow fields , which makes this state very unique . reflecting the kinetic origin of interparticle interactions , the introduction of disorder in the dynamic quantity , @xmath0 , is essential for avoiding the ordering , which is an interesting point unique to purely kinetic athermal systems .",
    "we also find a plastic crystal - like state in a rotating particle pair ( dumbbell ) system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]c ) above a critical @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]d ) .",
    "this state is characterized by hexatic ordering of the centre of mass of disk pairs ( dumbbells ) without any orientational order in the axis directions of dumbbells .",
    "so we find for this type of athermal systems made of rotating particles almost all states seen in its thermodynamic counterparts , including a liquid , a hexatic phase , a glass , and a plastic crystal .",
    "the only missing state is a liquid - crystalline state , but the lack of this state is natural consequence of the fact that the system is composed of rotating elements .",
    "we also note that the modification of the rotational direction leads to complex behaviours ; for example , we can introduce phase demixing of particles rotating oppositely ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]e ) , which may be used to separate different types of passive and active rotors . in relation to this",
    ", it is worth noting that phase separation between particles rotating clockwise and anti - clockwise was recently observed even without hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that such phase separation is observed in both systems with and without hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "it is also worth noting that the presence of regular arrays of vortices , e.g. , the triangle state , are predicted for an active polar film @xcite .",
    "so far we have not seen such a regular state , but the similarity in the physics between the two systems implies that it might exist in a certain parameter range .",
    "this is an interesting problem for future study .",
    "it is remarkable that our athermal system where particles interact only via hydrodynamic interactions exhibits such rich phase ( or more strictly , state ) behaviour and reproduces almost all the physical states observed in its thermal counterpart .",
    "we hope that these phase behaviours will be observed experimentally . for this purpose , a quasi-2d version of the experimental setup used in @xcite",
    "may be suitable , since the 2d nature of hydrodynamic interactions is important .",
    "here we have focused on the bulk behaviour of rotating disks to study the fundamental nature of dynamical phase behaviour from a viewpoint of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "the effects of confinement on such a system are also quite interesting not only from a fundamental viewpoint , but also from a viewpoint of applications to microfluidics @xcite .",
    "such effects on rotors in a fluid have recently been numerically studied by gtze and gompper @xcite .",
    "it is quite interesting to study how such spatial confinements affect all the dynamical phases we reported and the transition between them .    here",
    "it is worth stressing that even non - ergodic states of particles such as hexatic , glassy , and plastic crystal states have strong hydrodynamic flow fields , which makes these states quite distinct from their thermal counterparts .",
    "the interesting and unique feature of hydrodynamic self - organization is that structural ordering is the consequence of _ self - organization of flow _ dissipating energy and thus even non - ergodic states are maintained by dynamical flow . in nature , there are many dynamical systems in which crucial interactions between elements are of purely hydrodynamic origin .",
    "the coexistence of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions , the resulting unconventional off - axis force , the finite propagation speed of the interactions , and the significance of hydrodynamic degrees of freedom even for non - ergodic ( apparently static ) states lead to rich and non - trivial self - organization .",

    "<S> * self - organization of moving objects in hydrodynamic environments has recently attracted considerable attention in connection to natural phenomena and living systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the underlying physical mechanism is much less clear due to the intrinsically nonequilibrium nature , compared with self - organization of thermal systems . </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamic interactions are believed to play a crucial role in such phenomena . to elucidate the fundamental physical nature of many - body hydrodynamic interactions at a finite reynolds number , here we study a system of co - rotating hard disks in a two - dimensional viscous fluid at zero temperature . despite the absence of thermal noise , </S>",
    "<S> this system exhibits rich phase behaviours , including a fluid state with diffusive dynamics , a cluster state , a hexatic state , a glassy state , a plastic crystal state and phase demixing.we reveal that these behaviours are induced by the off - axis and many - body nature of nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions and the finite time required for propagating the interactions by momentum diffusion . *    </S>",
    "<S> self - organization is the autonomous organization of components into patterns or structures and the underlying mechanism can be grouped into two classes : thermal and athermal origin @xcite . compared to the understanding of self - assembly of a thermal system , which can be explained in terms of the free energy , that of an athermal system is far behind due to the lack of a firm theoretical background . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples for the latter is active matter in hydrodynamic environments , which shows many interesting unconventional pattern formation with exotic dynamical features @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> directional swimmers undergoing translational motion , like fishes , tend to swim together while forming a cluster of particular shape @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hexatic ordering of directionally self - propelling particles was also recently studied @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> rotation is another important type of motion . </S>",
    "<S> self - organization of passive rotors was first observed in laboratory experiments by grzybowski , stone , and whitesides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such rotation can be induced by applying a torque to a particle by magnetic @xcite and optical fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> self - organization of active rotors has also been studied intensively . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it was found that there are interesting stable bound states of spinning volvox algae @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it was shown @xcite that micro - organisms , like spermatozoa , self - organize into dynamic vortices and they form an array with local hexagonal order . </S>",
    "<S> this study indicates that large - scale coordination of cells can be regulated hydrodynamically , and chemical signals are not required . </S>",
    "<S> it was also shown recently that self - assembly of rotors is a generic feature of aggregating swimmers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there has also been a theoretical prediction for intriguing self - organization of rotating molecular motors in membranes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this and related problems have also been investigated by numerical simulations @xcite .    as described above , </S>",
    "<S> there exist two types of rotors @xcite : rotors driven by external torques are called passive rotors , while those that are internally driven are called active rotors and many such examples can be seen in biological systems </S>",
    "<S> . a realistic realization of a truly active system of self - rotors in biological systems may be one in which the particles are torque dipole with no resultant net torque on the system @xcite . to elucidate the physics of self - organization of flow created by rotors at a finite reynolds number , </S>",
    "<S> a system of hard disks each of which is rotated by an externally applied torque is an ideal model system . </S>",
    "<S> ordering of this system may be regarded as a nonequilibrium counterpart of thermodaynamic ordering of hard disks . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , unlike a thermodynamic system , where a state is selected solely by free energy , dynamic factors such as hydrodynamic interactions also affects the selection of a state of an out - of - equilibrium system .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , it has been now recognized that nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions play crucial roles in self - organization of rotating disks @xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the phenomena are beyond stokes approximations , and may even have a link to self - organization of vortices @xcite , which is observed at a high reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> vortex crystals are very interesting such examples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nonequilibrium , nonlinear , nonlocal , non - instantaneous nature of hydrodynamic interactions makes analytical approaches to this problem very difficult and thus numerical simulations are expected to play a crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> this problem also has a link to self - organization of a point vortex system @xcite , but the finite size and solidity of disks lead to far more rich behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> here we employ a fluid particle dynamics ( fpd ) method @xcite , which we developed for studying hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method treats a solid colloid as an undeformable fluid particle inside which the viscosity is considerably higher than the surrounding liquid . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation makes us free from solid - fluid boundary conditions , which significantly simplifies the computation . </S>",
    "<S> this method can quite naturally deal with many - body hydrodynamic interactions even at a high reynolds number .    in this communication , we study self - organization of rotating hard disks in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) incompressible liquid by using the fpd method . </S>",
    "<S> like the ising model for magnetic ordering or the hard sphere system for crystallization , this system may serve as a fundamental model system for studying dynamical phase behaviour caused by hydrodynamic interactions between rotating particles . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar to the above - mentioned experimental and theoretical works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we make our simulation in two dimensions ( 2d ) to compare with the behaviour of its thermal counterpart , 2d hard disks , whose thermodynamic behaviour is reasonably understood @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we report surprisingly rich phase ordering behaviours , such as aggregation , re - entrant order - disorder transition , glass transition , plastic crystal formation , and phase demixing in this class of strongly nonequilibrium systems . </S>"
