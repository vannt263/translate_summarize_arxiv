    "it is now thirty years since the first unambiguous identification of x - ray emission from our nearest giant spiral , m31 ( margon , lampton & cruddace 1974 ) . today we know that x - ray emission in galaxies comes from discrete sources and hot diffuse gas .",
    "discrete sources ( accreting compact objects and supernova remnants ) are a fossil record of the stellar population , and may be used as a probe of star formation history .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is the tracer of the hot gas ( @xmath0 k ) in galaxies and clusters ; in galaxies , it is an indicator of recent star formation .",
    "disentangling truly diffuse gas from faint , unresolved sources  such as faint x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , cataclysmic variables , coronal emission from main - sequence and t tauri stars is still a major problem , despite the fact that sensitivity and spatial resolution of the x - ray detectors have improved by three orders of magnitude since those early observations .",
    "today , x - ray studies of nearby galaxies can be conducted on two complementary levels .",
    "we can do a statistical study of the spatial and spectral distribution of the sources : this can help us distinguish between different physical classes of x - ray emitters . and we can use the x - ray sources as a tool to probe the structure and evolution of the host galaxy",
    ".    statistical studies of x - ray sources in the milky way are hampered by the large relative uncertainty in the distance of most sources ( often by a factor of two ) and by our very incomplete view due to the large extinction in the galactic plane .",
    "population studies can be conducted more easily in nearby galaxies , with more favorable viewing angles and the same relative distance for all the sources . by studying a large sample of galaxies",
    "it is also possible to quantify how the x - ray properties of a galaxy depend on its structural type and level of star - forming activity .",
    "moreover , by quantifying the relation between observed x - ray properties and star formation history in nearby galaxies , one may predict the luminosity and color distribution of the faint galaxies detected in the chandra deep field surveys ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) , and therefore probe star formation at high redshift .",
    "( see r. griffiths s contribution elsewhere in these proceedings . )    in this conference paper , i have chosen the starburst galaxy m83 to illustrate some of these issues . located at a distance of @xmath1 mpc , m83 is a grand - design spiral seen at low inclination .",
    "more than 100 sources are resolved in a 51 ks _",
    "chandra _ observation .",
    "in addition to the point sources , a true - color image ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows a bright starburst nucleus and strong , soft diffuse emission along the spiral arms .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity emitted from m83 in the 0.38.0 kev band is @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "erg s@xmath3 , @xmath4 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath5 erg s@xmath3 . in general , @xmath6 for starburst spirals ( fabbiano & shapley 2002 ; calzetti et al .",
    "1995 ; condon et al . 1998 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) ; all three bands can be used as indicators of star formation .",
    "] of this , @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 comes from the resolved sources and the rest is unresolved .",
    "the nuclear starburst contributes for @xmath8 erg s@xmath3 ( of which @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 from resolved sources ) .",
    "the unresolved x - ray emission is dominated by a multitemperature , optically thin plasma component , at @xmath10@xmath11 kev , slightly hotter in the nuclear region than in the arms ( figures 1 , 2 ) .",
    "it is likely to originate from gas shock - heated by core - collapse sn explosions km s@xmath3 , required to heat the gas to @xmath12 kev . assuming a sn rate @xmath13 yr@xmath3 for m83 , and a total mechanical energy @xmath14 erg injected into the ism by each sn , the total mechanical luminosity is @xmath15 erg s@xmath3 . ] .",
    "the unresolved emission from the disk region has a power - law - like tail that dominates above 3 kev .",
    "its origin is still unclear : a population of faint , unresolved xrbs can produce a power - law component .",
    "the emission can also be due to a second thermal plasma component at @xmath16 kev , or to compton upscattering of far - ir photons by relativistic electrons ( valinia & marshall 1998 ) .    from the observed temperature and luminosity , we estimate an average density @xmath17 @xmath18 and a total mass @xmath19 @xmath20 for the x - ray emitting gas in m83 ; the cooling timescale is @xmath21 yr . for the hot gas in the starburst nuclear region , @xmath22 @xmath18 , @xmath23 @xmath20 , @xmath24 yr .",
    "hence , the hot gas is an indicator of recent star formation .",
    "populations of discrete x - ray sources in different galaxies and different galactic environments ( bulge , disk , spiral arms , etc . ) have different morphologies for their luminosity distributions ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the slope and the break are indicative of the star - formation history ( wu 2001 ) : an unbroken power - law indicates continuous star formation ; a break ( ie , a lack of bright sources ) may be caused by aging of the x - ray source population , indicating the look - back time to the last major episode of star formation .",
    "this in turn provides information on the dynamical history of a galaxy , because star formation is often triggered by close encounters and mergers with other galaxies .",
    "color - color plots can separate different classes of x - ray sources , and distiguish xrbs in the soft and hard state ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "xrbs are , in turn , a mixture of young ( timescale of @xmath19 yr after star formation ) , wind - accreting , high - mass xrbs ( generally seen through higher intrinsic absorption ) , and old ( timescale of @xmath25 yr after star formation ) , roche - lobe accreting low - mass xrbs . for galactic sources ,",
    "the color and spectral separation between the hard and soft state is generally larger in xrbs with a bh accretor than in those with a ns .",
    "studies of luminosity and color variability offer another criterion to separate xrbs ( which often show state transitions ) from snrs ( which do not ) .",
    "the age of different classes of x - ray sources can be inferred from a study of their spatial correlation with various indicators of recent star formation , eg , the spiral arms defined by the hii regions ( fig . 5 ) .      in m83 ,",
    "detailed spectral analysis is possible for sources with an emitted luminosity @xmath26 erg s@xmath3",
    ". we can easily distinguish ( fig .",
    "6 ) :    * the x - ray nucleus , coincident with the optical / ir nucleus . its spectrum is consistent with that of a supermassive black hole accreting well below its eddington rate ( @xmath27 erg s@xmath3 ; @xmath28 ) ; * xrbs in a hard state : their x - ray spectrum is well fitted with a simple power law of photon index @xmath29@xmath30 ; * xrbs in a soft state : their x - ray spectra is softer , dominated by a blackbody or disk - blackbody at @xmath31 , plus a power law of photon index @xmath32@xmath33 ( due to compton upscattering of the disk photons ) ; * `` emission - line '' sources : they show a few prominent metal lines ( in particular from si and mg ) .",
    "the softer sources are more likely to be young snrs ; the harder ones could be x - ray binaries surrounded by a photoionized nebulae or stellar wind .",
    "they latter class would then be analogous to vela x-1 or cen x-3 in our galaxy ( eg , liedahl et al .  2000 ) ; * bright supersoft sources , characterized by a thermal spectrum with blackbody temperature @xmath34 ev .",
    "they are generally interpreted as accreting white dwarfs with stable nuclear burning on their surface ( see also di stefano & kong 2003 ) .    for",
    "a more extensive discussion of the spectral and temporal properties of the discrete sources in m83 , see soria & wu ( 2003 ) .",
    "the brightest point source , located @xmath35  south - east of the nucleus , is variable and has an emitted luminosity of @xmath36 erg s@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "6 , bottom panels ) .",
    "hence , it can be classified as an ultra - luminous source ( ulx ) .",
    "the term `` ulx '' is generally applied to x - ray sources outside a galactic nucleus which persistently exceed ( when in an active state ) the eddington luminosity of a 7-@xmath20 bh ( thought to be the `` canonical '' bh mass value ) ; some sources emit a luminosity of up to a few times @xmath39 erg s@xmath3 ( roberts & warwick 2000 ) . in fact , it is necessary to distinguish between bright snr ( for which the eddington limit does not apply ) and accreting sources . even in the absence of detailed spectral information , variability by a factor @xmath40",
    "is usually taken as a good indicator that a source is not an snr .",
    "correlation with a non - thermal radio source is another criterion to identify an snr .",
    "it is still unclear whether ultra - luminous accreting sources are simply the high - luminosity end of the x - ray binary population , or a different physical class of objects .",
    "no significant break or feature at @xmath41 erg s@xmath3 is found in the cumulative luminosity distribution of x - ray sources in galaxies which contain ulxs .",
    "however , the statistical error is large , due to the small number of sources in each galaxy above that luminosity .",
    "ulxs are found in elliptical galaxies ( eg , ngc 1553 : sarazin et al .",
    "2000 ; ngc 4697 : blanton , sarazin & irwin 2001 ) , associated with an old stellar population , often inside globuler clusters .",
    "their location , and the steep slope of the high - luminosity end of the x - ray luminosity function suggest that , in this case , they are old systems accreting from a low - mass companion . on the other hand ,",
    "ulxs are also often found in starburst or active star - forming galaxies ( eg , m82 : matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ; the antennae : zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function in these galaxies is typically an unbroken power - law with a flat slope , dominated at high luminosities by young high - mass xrbs . in this case , the ulxs appear to be associated with a very young stellar population .",
    "x - ray spectral analyses do not provide a unique physical identification , either . some ulxs can be fitted with a simple power law continuum ( la parola et al . 2001 ; strickland et al .",
    "others are better fitted with a disk - blackbody model ( makishima et al .",
    "2000 ; roberts et al .",
    "2002 ) with color temperatures @xmath421.5 kev ( such high color temperatures can still be consistent with a high - mass accretor , if the spectral hardening factor is @xmath43 ) .",
    "transitions from a hard to a soft state are seen in a few cases ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 ) , analogous to those detected in galactic bh candidates .",
    "at least one ulx has a supersoft spectrum with a blackbody temperature of @xmath44 ev ( swartz et al .",
    "finally , x - ray variability studies have shown a range of different behaviours : most of the sources are persistent ; a few are transients on timescales of a few months / years ; others are highly variable on timescales of a few thousand seconds ( a ulx in m74 : m. garcia 2002 , priv . comm",
    "* * intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs)*. + the eddington limit is proportional to the mass of the accreting object , hence a 100-@xmath20 bh could have a persistent luminosity @xmath45 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the first problem this model has to address is how to form them .",
    "it is still not known what the maximum mass is for bhs formed via sn explosions of single stars , and how this mass depends on the metallicity of the progenitor star . if bh masses @xmath46 are required to explain the observations , mergers of smaller - scale bodies in a dense environment are likely to be necessary .",
    "it has been shown ( sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ; kulkarni , hut , & mcmillan 1993 ) that it is not possible to merge small ( @xmath47 ) bhs in a globular cluster via three body interactions : recoils tend to kick the bhs out of the cluster before they can merge .",
    "however , mergers become possible if one considers four - body interactions ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) . the best chance to form an imbh occurs if a number of progenitor stars coalesce first into a @xmath48 star which would then undergo a sn explosion ( ebisuzaki et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this case , the formation process would be most likely to occur near the center of compact , young super - star clusters usually found in starburst galaxies .",
    "if super - star clusters are the progenitors of globular clusters , this could also explain the presence of imbhs in the old globulars of elliptical galaxies .",
    "yet another suggestion ( madau & rees 2001 ) is that imbhs could be pre - galactic remnants formed from the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds .",
    "the second problem to address is how to feed them : a discussion on the mass transfer mechanism ( roche - lobe overflow or stellar wind ) and allowed ranges of mass for the companion star is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "( see zezas & fabbiano 2002 for such a discussion regarding the ulxs in m82 ) .",
    "thirdly , how to observe them . the most reliable determination of the mass function for galactic bhs comes from optical observations of photometric variations and line velocity shifts of the accretion disk and companion star over a binary period .",
    "it is of course more difficult to achieve that in other galaxies ( for m83 , distance modulus @xmath49 ) . * * beating the eddington limit * + the classical eddington limit assumes that the average opacity @xmath50 .",
    "however , this may not be the case if the radiating medium ( accretion disk or stellar surface ) is clumpy .",
    "it can be shown that the flux - weighted , volume - averaged opacity can be lower than the electron scattering opacity for an inhomogeneous medium ( shaviv 1998 ) .",
    "if this is the case , more photons can escape without blowing away the accretion flow , so that steady - state luminosities @xmath51 erg s@xmath3 could in principle be attained by a stellar - mass bh with @xmath52 .",
    "observational evidence for `` super - eddington '' luminosities has been suggested in the case of novae ( shaviv 2001 ) .",
    "models of clumpy accretion disks based on the same principle have also been proposed ( begelman 2002 ) . at @xmath53",
    ", all systems should develop strong radiation - driven winds , whose density and velocity could in principle be inferred from high - resolution uv and x - ray spectra . *",
    "* beamed emitters * + if the x - ray emission is beamed towards us rather than isotropic , the estimated ulx luminosities can be scaled down , depending on the beaming factor .",
    "beamed x - ray emission is known to occur in some microquasars ( eg , grs 1915@xmath54105 ) .",
    "such systems would appear highly super - eddington if we happen to observe them pole - on ( fabrika & mescheryakov 2001 ; king et al .",
    "it is sometimes possible to determine whether the x - ray emission is beamed by studying the optical spectral lines of the photoionized nebula around a ulx . a detailed discussion of this technique is presented by m. pakull elsewhere in these proceedings .",
