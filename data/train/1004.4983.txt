    "the combinations of the corresponding quantities are dimensionless .",
    "this means that they have a combined critical exponent that is equal to zero .",

    "this universality class is supposed to be realized in a huge range of experimental systems : binary mixtures , uniaxial magnets or micellar systems ; see @xcite .    at finite values of the reduced temperature , power laws  ( [ power ] ) are subject to corrections .",
    "for example the magnetic susceptibility behaves as @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "typically we reduce the error bars by a factor of two to three compared with these studies .",
    "estimates obtained by using field theoretic methods are typically by a factor of ten less precise than those obtained here .",
    "the outline of our paper is the following : first we define the model and the observables that we have measured .",
    "next we discuss the update algorithm and give details of our simulations . using the data obtained , we extract numerical estimates for various universal amplitude ratios .",
