    "inspired by the achievement in the study of hadron spectroscopy within the framework of quark potential model [ 1 - 3 ] , there have been continuous efforts to apply the quark potential model and the resonating group method ( rgm ) [ 4 ] to study nucleon - nucleon , nucleon - meson and meson - meson interactions and scattering [ 5 - 20 ] . among these efforts , the study of kaon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction arose a particular interest in the past .",
    "due to the high penetrating power of @xmath4 meson , it is expected that the study of @xmath5 interaction would provide more information for nuclear structures and properties .",
    "since in the @xmath5 interaction , the one - pion exchange is forbidden , the two - pion exchange is suppressed [ 10,11 ] and there is no annihilation of valence quarks to appear , it is expected that the t - channel one - gluon exchange potential ( ogep ) plus the harmonic oscillator confinement potential would give a reasonable description of the @xmath5 interaction . with this idea , the authors in ref.[10 ] calculated the s - wave phase shifts of @xmath5 elastic scattering and found that the theoretical results are in quite good agreement with the experimental data in the low - energy domain . it is noted that in the calculation , the authors only took the coulomb , spin - spin and darwin terms in the t - channel ogep without considering the spin - orbital coupling and tensor force terms which contribute to the higher partial wave scattering .",
    "subsequently , to investigate p - wave phase shifts , the authors in ref.[11 ] introduced into their model the spin - orbital coupling terms originating from the t - channel one gluon exchange and a scalar exchange term describing the confinement interaction . as one knows , there are two kinds of spin - orbit coupling terms in the t - channel ogep : the spin - symmetric term and the spin - antisymmetric one .",
    "correspondingly , there also exist such two terms in the confining potential generated from the scalar exchange .",
    "the spin - symmetric terms in the two potentials have opposite signs .",
    "therefore , the effect of the spin - orbital coupling is suppressed just as required in the study of meson and baryon spectra [ 2,21 ] .",
    "however , the spin - antisymmetric terms are of the same sign and hence would produce large splitting which is in contradiction with the experiment [ 11 ] .",
    "such terms are therefore dropped out in ref.[11 ] .",
    "the calculation in ref.[11 ] showed that if the spin - orbit coupling terms are considered only , except for the @xmath6 channel phase shift , the sign and magnitude of the other channel phase shifts are well reproduced ; when the other terms in the t - channel ogep are taken into account together , there appears a serious problem that the @xmath7 channel phase shifts all become negative , conflicting with the experimental data .",
    "later , the s - wave phase shifts of @xmath8 scattering are restudied in ref.[15 ] by employing the born order diagrammatic technique . in the study , although only the spin - spin coupling term in the t - channel ogep is considered , the calculated result looks fine .",
    "subsequently , the born approximation was applied to investigate the @xmath0 scattering more extensively in ref.[17 ] . in the investigation ,",
    "apart from the hyperfine term in the ogep and the linear scalar confinement , the spin - orbital coupling and spin - independent terms in the ogep are taken into account in the evaluation of p - wave and d - wave phase shifts . nevertheless , the magnitudes of  most of the calculated phase shifts are smaller than the experimental ones . particularly , the sign of the theoretical @xmath9 wave phase shift is opposite to the experimental data .",
    "recently , the @xmath0 phase shifts are recalculated in ref.[18 ] within the constituent quark model by numerically solving the hill - wheeler equation , trying to give a consistent description for the @xmath0 interaction and the relevant meson and baryon spectra . in the calculation , besides the linear confining potential , the authors used only the coulomb term and the spin - spin interaction term multiplied by a phenomenological coefficient function of gaussian type .",
    "the calculated @xmath10 channel s - wave phase shift is pretty good in comparison with the experiment ; whereas for the @xmath7 channel s - wave phase shift , there appears a big discrepancy between the theoretical result and the experimental one .",
    "the authors also calculated higher angular momentum phase shifts without including the spin - orbit coupling and tensor force terms in the ogep . even though the results were considered to be quite reasonable , the calculation is not complete theoretically because the spin - orbit coupling and tensor force terms in the ogep were not taken into account .    from the previous works mentioned above , it is clearly seen that a precise understanding of the @xmath0 interaction at quark - gluon level still calls for a sophisticated quark potential model which can give a consistently good description for not only the @xmath0 interaction , but also the @xmath1 interaction which has never been investigated in the past . for this purpose , it is necessary to incorporate new physical ingredients into the model as suggested in refs.[11,18 ] . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to investigate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions and their low - energy elastic phase shifts in a consistent way within the quark potential model .",
    "the new features of this investigation include : ( 1 ) the potential model is composed of the t - channel ogep [ 1 ] and the s - channel ogep [ 22 ] as well as a phenomenological confining potential .",
    "the t - channel ogep is responsible for the @xmath0 interaction , while for the @xmath1 interaction where the annihilation and creation of a quark - antiquark ( @xmath2 ) pair appear , the s - channel ogep is necessary to be considered as demonstrated in our previous investigations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 interactions [ 19,20 ] . in these investigations",
    ", it was shown that the s - channel ogep plays a dominant role for the @xmath11 @xmath10 channel s - wave scattering and is necessary to be considered for the formation of @xmath13 molecular states .",
    "as one knows , the two ogeps are derived from qcd in the nonrelativistic approximation of order @xmath14 and contain spin - independent terms such as the coulomb , velocity - dependent terms and spin - dependent terms such as the spin - spin interaction , spin - orbital coupling and tensor force terms .",
    "all these terms are taken into account in our calculation as should be done in a theoretically consistent treatment .",
    "( 2 ) inclusion of the qcd renormalization effect .",
    "it is well - known that the ogeps are derived from the tree diagram approximation of the s - matrix elements or the irreducible interaction kernels in the bethe - salpeter ( b - s ) equation .",
    "obviously , to refine the potential model , the qcd renormalization effect is necessary to be incorporated into the model .",
    "this can be done by replacing the qcd coupling constant and quark masses in the ogep with their effective ones which were derived in our previous work in the one loop approximation and a mass - dependent momentum space subtraction [ 23 ] .",
    "our calculation indicates that the inclusion of the qcd renormalization effect gives an appreciable improvement on the theoretical phase shifts , particularly , for the p - wave phase shifts .",
    "( 3 ) the contribution from the color octet of the three quark cluster ( @xmath15 ) and the quark - antiquark cluster ( @xmath2 ) to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering is considered because when the kaon ( antikaon ) and nucleon interact , the color singlet states of the clusters ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath2 ) are possibly polarized .",
    "this consideration has been justified in the recent studies of meson production and decay phenomena [ 24,25 ] . in these studies",
    ", the color octet of @xmath2 cluster plays an essential role in explaining the experimental data . according to our calculation",
    ", the consideration of color octet can also improve the theoretical results .",
    "( 4 ) nonlocal @xmath0 and @xmath16 effective interaction potentials are derived from the underlying interquark potentials by employing the rgm and used to evaluate the phase shifts .",
    "we do not use the localized version of the potentials because an inappropriate localization would damage the hermiticity of the potentials and induce other unexpected errors .",
    "( 5 ) the effect of spin - orbital coupling in the t - channel ogep is necessarily suppressed in the present investigation in order to reproduce the p - wave phase shifts .",
    "this is consistent with the requirement in the study of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the suppression may be achieved by a proper change of the coefficient function of the spin - orbit term in the effective intercluster potentials which are derived from the corresponding term in the ogep . with the considerations mentioned above , we obtain in this paper a series of theoretical @xmath0 s - wave , p - wave and d - wave phase shifts which are in fairly good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in addition , a series of theoretical phase shifts for the @xmath1 elastic scattering are predicted .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows : section 2 is used to describe the quark potential model and show how to derive the @xmath0 and @xmath1 effective interaction potentials .",
    "section 3 serves to describe the calculation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering phase shifts . in the last section ,",
    "the calculated results are presented and discussions are made .",
    "there are four appendices . in appendix",
    "a , we show the construction of the color - flavor - spin wave function for the systems under consideration . in appendix",
    "b , the effective @xmath0 and @xmath1 interaction potentials derived in position space are listed . in appendix c",
    ", we briefly describe the derivation of the phase shift formula used in our calculation .",
    "appendix d is used to make some explanations on the qcd renormalization .",
    "according to the quark model , the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) system may be treated as two quark clusters : the @xmath17-cluster @xmath18 ( the @xmath19-cluster @xmath20 ) and the @xmath21-cluster ( @xmath22 where @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",

    "the phase shifts of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) low - energy elastic scattering are calculated in the born approximation .",
    "as argued in appendix c and demonstrated in the previous literature [ 14 , 15 ] , the born approximation can reasonably describe hadron elastic low energy scattering processes . in this approximation and in the center - of - mass frame",

    "it is noted here that the formula in eq.(28 ) is general for evaluating the transition amplitude , particularly , in the case that the spin - orbit coupling and tensor force terms are present in the nonlocal effective potentials .",
    "we would like here to discuss the problem of suppression of the effect of spin - orbital coupling .",
    "it is a common recognition in the study of hadron spectroscopy that the effect of the spin - orbital coupling term in the t - channel ogep ought to be suppressed by the corresponding term in the confining potential [ 2 ] . in ref.[21 ] , one of the authors in this paper and his coworkers proposed a @xmath2 confining potential which was obtained from a general lorentz structure of the confinement . in the confining potential ,",
    "there are various terms among which the spin - orbit coupling term is of a sign opposite to the corresponding one in the ogep . in this paper , to avoid the complexity of such a confining potential , we alternatively take an effective treatment to achieve the spin - orbital suppression .",
    "looking at the expression of the potential @xmath153 shown in appendix b , one can see that there is a kind of factorial functions to appear in some terms of the potential @xmath154 which are of the form @xmath155 in particular , this function is related to the spin - orbit coupling term in the potential @xmath156 the function @xmath157 may appropriately be replaced by an interpolating function such that @xmath158 to obtain the above expression , we have used the approximate expression of the following integral @xmath159 as shown in fig.5 , when we take the parameter @xmath160 , the function on the right hand side of eq.(32 ) very approaches the real value of the integral when @xmath161 is not too large . however , as shown in fig.6 , the above value of @xmath162 leads to worse p - wave phase shifts . in order to get better p - wave phase shifts",
    ", we have to take some larger value of @xmath162 which just plays the role of suppressing the effect of spin - orbital coupling .",
    "finally , let us discuss the inclusion of qcd renomalization effect .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the ogep is derived from the s - matrix or the b - s irreducible interaction kernel in the tree diagram approximation . obviously , to improve our calculation ,",
    "it is natural to consider the correction arising from qcd renormalization .",
    "this can be done by replacing the qcd coupling constant and quark masses in the ogep with the effective ones which are obtained by solving the renormalization group equations satisfied by the renormalized coupling constant and quark masses .",
    "this procedure , as proved in ref.[27 ] and demonstrated in appendix d , is equivalent to replacing the free wave functions , the free propagators and the bare vertices in the tree diagrams with the exact ones . in the calculation of this paper",
    ", we employ the effective coupling constant and quark masses given in ref.[23 ] which were derived from qcd in the one - loop approximation and the mass - dependent momentum space subtraction .",
    "these effective quantities are suitable to any energy , particularly , to the low energy , unlike the results obtained in the minimal subtraction [ 28 ] which actually are applicable only in the large momentum limit .",
    "the effective fine structure constant used has the expression like this [ 23 ]    @xmath163    where @xmath164 is a coupling constant and @xmath165 is a function of variable @xmath166 which has different expressions given by the time - like momentum subtraction ( the subtraction performed at time - like renormalization point ) and the space - like momentum subtraction ( the subtraction carried out at the space - like renormalization point ) . for the time - like momentum subtraction , @xmath167   \\eqnum{34}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is the quark flavor number which will be taken to be three in this paper .",

    "the latter subtraction was performed at the space - like renormalization point .",
    "it would be noted that in writing the above effective coupling constant , the mass difference between different quarks is ignored for simplicity .",
    "the behaviors of the effective coupling constants given in eqs.(33)-(35 ) are described in fig.7 . from the figures , we see that the effective coupling constants given by the time - like and space - like momentum subtractions have different behaviors in the low - energy regime .",
    "it is interesting to note that the effective coupling constant given in the space - like momentum subtraction is almost the same as given in the minimal subtraction in the regime .",
    "this situation happens only in the case of ignoring the mass difference between different quarks and taking @xmath173 .",
    "in other cases , the difference between the results given by the both subtractions will be manifest .",
    "the effective quark mass is represented as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the constant quark mass given at @xmath176 which will appropriately be chosen to be the constituent quark mass in the quark potential model , @xmath177 is a function which also has different expressions for the different subtractions . for the time - like momentum subtraction , @xmath178 while , for the space - like momentum subtraction , @xmath179 where @xmath180   \\eqnum{39}\\ ] ] and @xmath181   \\eqnum{40}\\ ] ] the behaviors of the effective quark masse given by the time - like momentum subtraction and the real part of the effective quark mass given in the space - like momentum subtraction are depicted in fig.8 .",
    "the figures show that at low energy the effective masses given in the both subtractions are not different so much .",
    "for the interaction taking place in the t - channel , as explained in appendix d , the transfer momentum is space - like , while for the interaction in the s - channel , the transfer momentum is time - like .",
    "therefore , for the t - channel ogep , we will use the effective coupling constant and quark masses given by the space - like momentum subtraction and in this case , we only adopt the real part of the effective masses in our calculation ; while , for the s - channel ogep , the effective coupling constant and the quark masses given in the time - like momentum subtraction will be employed .",
    "the variable @xmath166 is usually defined as a ratio of the momentum related to the process of quark - gluon interactions . in this paper , as an effective treatment , we directly define it as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is taken to be the magnitude of the relative momentum of the two interacting particles @xmath184 and @xmath21 ( or @xmath185 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "this section is used to present calculated results for the @xmath0 ( @xmath186 ) elastic scattering phase shifts , discuss adjustments of the theoretical parameters and analyze the effect of color octet and qcd renormalization as well as the suppression of the spin - orbital coupling .",
    "first , we focus our attention on the @xmath0 scattering . the theoretical phase shifts of the @xmath0 scattering are depicted in figs.1 - 3 . in the figures , the solid lines represent the final results obtained by considering the contributions arising from the color octet , the qcd renormalization and the spin - orbit suppression .",
    "to exhibit the effects of the color octet and the qcd renormalization , in the figures , we also show the results without considering these effects .",
    "such results are calculated with the same parameters as for the solid lines and represented by the dotted and dashed lines respectively in figs.1 - 3 .",
    "the figures show us that the agreement between the final calculated results and the experimental data is good for the phase shifts of all s - waves , @xmath9 wave and @xmath187 wave in the low - energy domain , particularly , in the region of the laboratory momentum less than 600 mev to which the nonrelativistic quark potential model is considered to be applicable . for the other p - wave and d - wave phase shifts ,",
    "the agreement is qualitatively reasonable . in obtaining these results",
    ", we used the parameters as follows : the qcd coupling constant @xmath188 @xmath189 , the constituent quark masses @xmath190 mev and @xmath191 mev , the size parameter of harmonic oscillator @xmath192 fm , the force strength of confinement @xmath193 gev , the color combination coefficient @xmath194 , the scale parameter of qcd renormalization @xmath195 gev and the parameter of spin - orbital suppression @xmath196 .",
    "these parameters are adjusted to give a better fit to the @xmath0 elastic scattering experimental data , mainly to the s - wave phase shifts because the @xmath0 elastic scattering data are available and rather sufficient [ 29,30 ] . in comparison with the previous results given in refs.[10 , 11 , 17 , 18 ]",
    ", our calculation achieves a considerable improvement on the theoretical phase shifts for all the partial waves not only in the magnitude , but also in the sign .",
    "especially , for the @xmath197 wave phase shift , it now gets a right sign in our calculation , opposite to the previous result which was given a wrong sign [ 17 ] .",
    "now let us analyze the effects of the color octet , the qcd renormalization and the suppression of the spin - orbital coupling . in adjusting the theoretical parameters , we found that the calculated results are sensitive to the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath198 any small change would cause noticeable influence on calculated values . for instance , when we let @xmath77 increase , the absolute values of s - wave phase shifts decrease rather fast .",
    "in particular , when the @xmath77 tends to unity , i.e. the color octet is absent , as denoted by the dotted lines in fig.1 , we obtain the s - wave phase shifts similar to those given in ref.[17 ] . in this case , certainly , we may give a better fit of the calculated result to the experimental one by adjusting the parameter @xmath109 and others , but , we failed to simultaneously get a good result for another s - wave phase shift , as was demonstrated previously in ref.[18 ] .",
    "only when the color octet is considered , it is possible to get consistently good results for the both s - wave phase shifts as denoted by the solid lines in fig.1 .",
    "this suggests that the introduction of the color octet is necessary in our calculation . from figs.2 and 3",
    ", we also see that the inclusion of the color octet gives a appreciable effect on the p and d wave phase shifts .    in this paper , the two kinds of spin - orbital terms in the t - channel ogep : the spin - symmetric term and the spin - antisymmetric one are all taken into account . in this case",
    ", we still encountered the puzzling problem for the p - wave phase shifts as was revealed originally in ref.[11 ] and mentioned in the introduction .",
    "if the qcd renormalization effect is not considered , except for the @xmath199 and @xmath9 wave phase shifts , it seems to be able to reproduce the phase shifts for the other phase shifts by readjusting the parameters involved .",
    "however , as exhibited in fig.2 , for the @xmath199 and @xmath197 waves , it is impossible to get a satisfactory result of their phase shifts .",
    "particularly , for the @xmath9 wave , its phase shift is always of a wrong sign as the previous result given in ref.(17 ) .",
    "this problem can only be resolved by taking the qcd renormalization effect into account in our calculation . in this way , the @xmath199 and @xmath9 wave phase shifts are accessible to the experimental values . as shown in fig.3 , the qcd renormalization effect gives an essential improvement on the d - wave phase shifts as well .",
    "particularly , it renders the @xmath187 and @xmath200 wave phase shifts to have the right signs .",
    "but , this effect is not noteworthy for the s - wave phase shifts .",
    "this explains why the previous investigations could give some rather reasonable results for the s - wave phase shift .",
    "however , as shown in our calculation , in order to get the desirable phase shifts for all partial waves , it is necessary to incorporate the qcd renormalization effect into the model used .",
    "in addition , to achieve such results , as mentioned in sect.3 , the spin - orbital coupling effect is necessary to be suppressed .",
    "the necessity of the suppression is separately illustrated in fig.6 for the p - wave phase shifts only .",
    "this is because the spin - orbit term in the effective potential gives no contribution to the s - wave scattering and it mainly affect the p - wave scattering .",
    "fig.6 indicates that when the parameter @xmath162 is taken to be the value @xmath160 which makes the function @xmath201 reach its real values , the @xmath202 wave and the @xmath199 wave phase shifts are far from the experimental ones , but , when the @xmath162 is getting larger , the absolute values of the @xmath203 wave and the @xmath199 wave phase shifts become to be comparable with the experimental results . for the other p - waves , the phase shifts evaluated at @xmath196 are also better than those given at @xmath160 .",
    "let us turn to the @xmath1 scattering .",
    "at present , the low energy elastic and inelastic experimental data for the @xmath1 scattering are insufficient [ 31 - 33 ] .",
    "therefore , the detailed partial wave analysis for the scattering is almost absent .",
    "but it is a common conclusion suggested in the previous investigations that the @xmath204 interaction is strongly attractive [ 34 ] . for the @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath7channel ,",
    "i.e. , for the @xmath205 scattering , there is almost no available data and different theoretical models give different predictions . in view of this situation",
    ", our calculated results for the @xmath1 phase shifts can only be viewed as a theoretical prediction [ 35,36 ] .",
    "it would be noted that unlike the @xmath0 interaction for which the exchanged part of the effective potential generated from the t - channel ogep is dominant , for the @xmath206 interaction , there is no such an exchanged potential .",
    "instead , the direct part of the s - channel ogep plays an essential role and leads to an attractive interaction as seen from the positiveness of the phase shifts plotted in fig.4 . in the figure , the prediction for the p and d wave phase shifts",
    "are simultaneously given as well .",
    "all the phase shifts in the figure are presented in the momentum region less than 200 mev where any resonance could not appear . here",
    "we take the @xmath204 s - wave phase shift given in this paper as an example to estimate the reasonability of our calculation . from the relation @xmath207",
    "[ 37 ] where @xmath208 is the effective scattering length and @xmath209 is the @xmath127-th wave scattering amplitude and the formulas given in ( c.2 ) and ( c.15 ) , we have @xmath210 by this relation and the calculated s - wave phase shift , it is found that the real part of the scattering length is above 0.58 which just lies in the range shown in refs.[33,35 ] .",
    "in addition , we note that our calculation predicts a weaker attraction for the @xmath205 interaction which is different from previous result ( see nucl - th/0004021 ) .    at last",
    ", it should be emphasized that the quark potential model used in this paper was established in the nonrelativistic approximation of order @xmath14 , therefore , the calculated results are only valid for the @xmath0 and @xmath16 elastic scattering in the low energy domain .",
    "the model used can not give a complete description for the inelastic scattering and the production of resonances which would appear for some higher partial waves in the higher energy regime . to explore the @xmath0 and @xmath1 inelastic scattering in the higher energy regime , it is necessary to apply a relativistic approach or a nonperturbative theory .",
    "anyway , the investigation based on the constituent quark model is meaningful as it is not only helpful to understand @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions from the underlying dynamics , but also provides a firm basis of studying five - quark bound states .",
    "the authors would like to express their thanks to professor dick arndt for his kind help .",

    "now we proceed to derive the formula written in eq.(26 ) .",
    "let us expand the wave functions in ( c.1 ) in partial waves @xmath316 @xmath317 and @xmath318 where @xmath319 is the legendre function of rank @xmath127 . with these expansions , noticing the asymptotic behaviors of the spherical bessel function @xmath320 and the function @xmath321@xmath322 @xmath323 one may find a result from ( c.1 ) such that @xmath324 on the other hand , the transition amplitude may also be expanded in partial waves @xmath325 where @xmath326 combining ( c.2 ) , ( c.9 ) , ( c.13 ) and ( c.14 ) , it is easy to derive the following relation @xmath327    when ( c.7 ) is substituted into ( c.4 ) , we can write @xmath328 where @xmath329 on inserting ( c.17 ) into ( c.15 ) , we have @xmath330 where @xmath331 upon substituting ( c.19 ) and the taylor expansion of @xmath332 into ( c.16 )",
    ", one may find @xmath333 from the above equality , it is clearly seen that there exists an one - to - one correspondence between the terms of the same order in the both series .",
    "when only the first term in each series is considered , we obtain @xmath334 which is proportional to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath308 .",
    "this just is the formula for the phase shift which is given in the so - called born approximation . if the phase shift is really proportional to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath308 as in the born approximation , from the corresponding higher order terms of the both series in ( c.21 ) , we can write @xmath335 which is proportional to @xmath336 and means that the @xmath337-th terms in the both series in ( c.21 ) are approximately equal to each other as if ( c.23 ) is approximately given by taking the equality in ( c.22 ) to the @xmath338-th power .",
    "if the relation in ( c.23 ) holds , we see , the formula in ( c.22 ) appears to be a good approximation .",
    "to help understanding of the renormalization formulas written in sect.3 , in this appendix , we give some explanations of the qcd renormalization .",
    "it is well - known that the t - channel ogep in eq.(4 ) and the s - channel ogep in eq.(6 ) are usually derived from the lowest - order s - matrix elements given by the tree feynman diagrams representing respectively the quark - quark(or quark - antiquark ) scattering and quark - antiquark annihilation processes in the nonrelativistic approximation of the order @xmath14 . as an example , we write the lowest order s - matrix element for two - quark scattering as follows    @xmath339    where @xmath340 is the free quark wave function , @xmath341 is its dirac conjugate ( here the spin indices of the spinor functions are suppressed for simplicity ) , @xmath342 is the gluon free propagator with @xmath343and @xmath344 is the bare vertex with @xmath345 being the coupling constant and @xmath346 the color matrix .",
    "correspondingly , the exact s - matrix element given by the one - gluon exchange interaction is represented as @xmath347 where @xmath348 , @xmath349 and @xmath350 denote the full ( or say , dressed ) quark wave function , gluon propagator and quark - gluon vertex respectively in which all higher order perturbative corrections are included . according to the well - known renormalization relations @xmath351 where the subscript r marks the renormalized quantities , @xmath352 , @xmath353 and @xmath354 are the renormalization constants for the quark wave function , the gluon propagator and the quark - gluon vertex respectively , one can get from ( d.2 ) that @xmath355 as shown in ref ( 27 ) , the renormalized quantities in the above can be determined by their renormalization group equations and their renormalization boundary conditions .",
    "the results given by solving the renormalization group equations are @xmath356 where @xmath357 and @xmath358 are of the same forms as the free wave functions except that the quark mass in them becomes the effective ( running ) one , @xmath359 formally is the same as the free propagator but the gauge parameter in it is replaced by the effective one , @xmath360 in the bare vertex @xmath361 is the effective coupling constant , @xmath362 , @xmath363 and @xmath364 are the anomalous dimensions defined by @xmath365 on inserting ( d.5 ) into ( d.4 ) , we see that the anomalous dimensions are all cancelled out with each other . as a result , we have    @xmath366    this s - matrix element is completely the same as the one shown in ( d.1 ) except that the quark mass , the gauge parameter and the coupling constant are replaced by the running ones . in the nonrelativistic approximation of order @xmath14 ,",
    "one may derive a ogep from ( d.7 ) which in the feynman gauge is just as that written in eq.(4 ) with the coupling constant and quark mass being the effective ones .",
    "these effective quantities precisely represent the renornalization effect and at one - loop level , they are of the forms as given in sect.3 . for the s - channel ogep ,",
    "the discussion is completely the same .",
    "next , we would like to address the renormalization point . in the ordinary qcd renormalization",
    "performed in the minimal subtraction scheme , which is suitable in the large momentum limit because only in this limit the quark mass can be set to be zero , the renormalization point is chosen to be space - like .",
    "this choice is suitable to the scattering process because in this case the transfer momentum , i.e. the variable of the gluon propagator in ( d.2 ) is space - like .",
    "this can be seen from the following derivation , @xmath367 in the high energy limit , we can set @xmath368 , therefore @xmath369 in the low energy domain , since @xmath370 ( d.8 ) can be approximated as @xmath371 so , for the t - channel ogep , it is suitable to use the effective coupling constant and quark mass given by the subtraction performed at space - like renormalization point . while , for the annihilation process , the momentum in the gluon propagator is time - like because in this case @xmath372 , @xmath373 in the large momentum limit , we can write @xmath374 in the low energy regime , we have @xmath375 therefore , for the s - channel ogep , it is appropriate to use the effective quantities given by the subtraction carried out at time - like renormalization point .",
