    "here we would like to emphasize that although the parafermions have been shown in to obey the haldane exclusion principle in the statistical sense which is a valid description for large quantities of parafermions , for small number of parafermions we need to know the concrete rules which govern the combinatorics of parafermions .",

    ", we will have to construct what could be called parafermion quantum mechanics and learn how to add angular momenta of the quantum mechanical particles obeying parafermion statistics .",
    "it was shown in that if you put @xmath13 particles on a sphere with a magnetic monopole in the center , turn on @xmath0 particle interaction and then adjust the total flux of the magnetic field through the surface of the sphere to be equal to @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the filling factor , @xmath28 and @xmath11 being either odd ( for fermions ) or even ( for bosons ) nonnegative integer , you discover that the electrons settle into one unique zero energy ground state with the wave function _",

    "these states can all be grouped into the angular momentum multiplets .",
    "the reason for this is more or less clear . by increasing the flux by 1",
    ", we create quasiholes .",
    "there is more than one way of creating those quasiholes which explains the degeneracy of states at a higher flux .    as was explained in the elementary quasiholes at arbitrary @xmath7",
    "are not laughlin quasiholes .",
    "rather , they are quasiholes which carry flux @xmath31 and we create @xmath7 of them at once . the wave functions with quasiholes can be found with the help of conformal field theory , by inserting the fields @xmath24 of the parafermion conformal field theory .",
    "however , we are not going to be interested in the explicit wave functions .",
    "what we want to explain in this section is the numerically observed degeneracy of the states with quasiholes on a sphere and how exactly one could generate all the degeneracies .",
    "we will show how the correct angular momentum multiplets can be obtained by putting parafermions into orbitals on a sphere and combining their angular momenta in a way consistent with their fractional statistics .",
    "that generalizes the prior treatment of the pfaffian state in .",
    "now we would like to present , first without explanation , the rules for finding the degeneracies of the excitations above the @xmath32 state , that is , for @xmath25-parafermions .",
    "it was found in , by matching the numerical data , that , as we increase the flux , the degeneracy of states we get for the @xmath25 parafermions is given by the following formulas .",
    "the number of excitations at the excess flux 1 ( 3 quasiholes , each carrying @xmath33 of the flux quantum ) is given by a binomial coefficient [ firstcoef ] n/3 + 3 3 , with @xmath13 being the total number of the electrons .",
    "@xmath13 should be divisible by three .",
    "this coefficient has a simple interpretation as the number of ways you can put 3 bosons into @xmath34 orbitals .",
    "the reason why the excitations at the excess flux @xmath35 behave as bosons was explained in and is essentially the same for the parafermion states as for the pfaffian state .    moreover , following",
    ", we can assign the angular momentum quantum numbers to these states . for this purpose",
    "we interpret the @xmath34 states as the orbitals on a sphere , in the multiplet of the angular momentum @xmath36 .",
    "when we put the bosons on this sphere , we generate the angular momentum multiplets by combining their angular momenta while keeping their wave function totally symmetric .",
    "while we could refer to any standard quantum mechanics textbooks for the rules on how to combine the angular momenta of bosons , we can recast these rules into the following simple form .",
    "let us visualize @xmath34 orbitals as boxes .",
    "each box has a number @xmath37 assigned to it which varies from @xmath38 to @xmath39 by steps of @xmath35 .",
    "we are allowed to put as many bosons as we wish into each particular box .",
    "for example , for @xmath40 we have @xmath41 boxes with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows one possible way to put 3 bosons into 3 boxes , by putting 2 of them into @xmath44 box and one into @xmath42 box , thus giving the total @xmath44 . of course , there are @xmath45 ways to put 3 bosons into 5 boxes . out of these 10 ways ,",
    "the angular momentum projections @xmath46 or @xmath47 can be obtained in 1 way each , while the angular momentum projections @xmath48 or @xmath43 can be obtained in 2 different ways each .",
    "we immediately recognize the sum of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 angular momentum multiplets . and indeed , this is confirmed by the numerical data .    as the flux",
    "is increased we observe many more excited states .",
    "it was found in that the number of states at the excess flux @xmath51 is given by [ par1 ] n/3 + 6 6 + 3 n/3 + 5 6 + n/3 + 4 6 , and at the three excess flux quanta [ par2 ] n/3 + 9 9 + 10 n/3 + 8 9 + 10 n/3 + 7 9 .",
    "the higher fluxes turned out to be harder to analyze as there is less numerical data available for them .",
    "we observe that the number of states at these flux quanta is reminiscent of the corresponding formula for the pfaffian which was found in to be [ pfaf1 ] _ f , ( -1)^f=(-1)^n , fn n f ( n - f)/2 + 2 n with @xmath52 being the number of the excess flux quanta .",

    "@xmath32 parafermion conformal field theory contains two fields of dimension @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . expanding them in terms of modes we obtain ^(1)(z ) = _ n ^(1)_n z^-n - 2 3 ,   ^(2)(z )",

    "it is obvious that the modes @xmath139 and @xmath140 have to annihilate the vacuum if @xmath141 .",
    "applying the modes with @xmath142 to the vacuum we can in fact create parafermionic states .",

    "these relations are very complicated .",
    "fortunately for @xmath32 the set of independent states have already been derived in .",
    "here for completeness we are going to quote the answer .",
    "the full set of linearly independent states is created by applying the modes of the parafermions of the first kind @xmath143 or a certain combination of the modes @xmath144 .",
    "we do not need to use the modes of the parafermion of the second kind @xmath145 as its modes create states which are linearly dependent on the states created by @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",

    "we start with taking the limit @xmath166 . in that limit",
    "the right hand side of is proportional to @xmath167 .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the operator product expansions _ 1 ( z ) _ 1 ( z ) ( z - z)^-2 k _",

    "therefore , we continue this process further and take @xmath174 . by doing so we indeed recover the correlation function with the field @xmath175 , .",
    "it is clear at this point that as we continue ` gluing ' parafermion fields together at some point we will arrive at [ statelast ] .    at this stage",
    "we should be careful . by taking @xmath176 to @xmath22 we should be able to recover the identity operator @xmath177 .",
    "let us check that this is indeed the case .",
    "the main singularity of as @xmath178 is @xmath179 which indeed matches and therefore , [ statenew ] . by its definition ,",
    "the identity operator does not depend on its position , and therefore the right hand side of should not depend on @xmath22 . to see that , let us recall that in the following theorem was proved .",
    "the wave function @xmath164 for @xmath13 particles whose first @xmath7 particles live at the same point @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of the wave function for @xmath180 particles in the following way , [ theorem ] ( z_k , z_k ,  , z_k , z_k+1 ,  , z_n )",
    "_ k < i n ( z_k - z_i)^2 ( z_k+1 , z_k+2 ,  , z_n ) . substituting to we see that [ statex ] , that is , @xmath160 is indeed an identity operator .",
    "the correlation function is insensitive to its insertion . that completes the first part of our proof",
    "if we continue to expand in powers of @xmath181 we observe that we should reproduce the operator product expansion with @xmath162 mod @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , we must see that the linear term of that expansion vanishes , @xmath182 .",
    "if this term did nt vanish , that would mean that in addition to the parafermion fields , the conformal field theory whose correlation function is given by has a dimension 1 operator @xmath183 which generates a u@xmath184 symmetry ( see ) .",
    "such an operator should be absent in the parafermion theory .",
    "let us check that it is indeed absent .    continuing the expansion of in powers of @xmath181 we find that the linear term is obviously proportional to [ statelast1 ] z_k-1 .",
    "|_z_k-1=z_k . to show that this term is zero",
    "it is sufficient to show that [ theor ] .",
    "z_k-1 ( z_k-1 , z_k-1 ,  , z_k-1 , z_k , z_k+1 ,  , z_n )    z_n ) .",
    "we can further simplify the equality by noting that since @xmath164 is a symmetric function of its arguments , it is enough to differentiate it with respect to just one variable , [ theor1 ] .",

    "to prove we again recall the definition of @xmath29 as given in . to construct it",
    ", we break all its coordinates into @xmath185 clusters of @xmath7 coordinates and then sum a certain expression , written in terms of these clusters , over all the permutations of @xmath13 particles .",
    "let us first look at the right hand side of .",
    "in accordance with the theorem proved in , the only terms which contribute to @xmath186 in the sum over permutations are those where all the @xmath22 belong to the same cluster .",
    "this is how could be derived .",
    "let us now make an assumption , which we will justify later , that the only terms which contribute to the left hand side of when we substitute for @xmath164 are also those where all the @xmath176 and @xmath22 belong to the same cluster .",
    "it is possible to convince oneself that after some algebra the sum of these terms can be reduced to = _ r=1^k _",
    "0<j < n / k ( z_k - z_p(r+kj ) ) ( z_k- z_p(r+kj+s(r ) ) ) ( z_k-1-z_p(r+kj ) ) ( z_k-1-z_p(r+kj+s(r ) ) ) _ k < i n ( z_k-1-z_i)^2 _ 0<j < l < n / k _ j+1 , l+1 , where @xmath187 gives a permutation of the integer numbers @xmath0 , @xmath188 , @xmath67 , @xmath13 . and @xmath189 for @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "@xmath18 are the expressions .",
    "note that @xmath18 do not depend on @xmath176 and @xmath192 . applying",
    "the derivatives as in we get [ permu ] .",

    "the last line in follows from the fact that the summation over @xmath193 completely symmetrizes the sum in the second line of over all the permutations @xmath194 .",
    "therefore we have proved on the assumptions that the only terms that contribute are those where the first @xmath7 coordinates of @xmath164 belong to the same cluster . to see that it is indeed so , let us recall again that according to the theorem proved in all such term should vanish as @xmath176 approach @xmath22 .",
    "since they are polynomials they vanish at least as @xmath195 , or perhaps even faster .",
    "if they vanish faster , their derivative with respect to @xmath22 with the setting @xmath196 after differentiation is definitely zero . if , on the other hand , they vanish linearly , then we can argue that for each term vanishing as @xmath195 there is another permutation of the coordinates different from the first one by exchanging exactly the two coordinates in that difference",
    ". this term will be proportional to @xmath181 .",
    "after differentiating _ and setting _",
    "@xmath197 , these terms will cancel each other .",
    "this concludes the proof that the wave function conjectured in to be the correlation function of the parafermions is indeed the correlation function of the parafermions .",
