    "phonons in extended media have long been the subject of detailed investigations , in particular of their dom ( density of modes , @xmath3 ) and velocity , @xmath4 , as a function of angular frequency @xmath5 ( e.g. see kittel 2005 ) .",
    "graphite , in particular , was abundantly investigated from the early work of nicklow , wakabayashi and smith @xcite to the recent one by mohr et al .",
    "by contrast , the study of vibrations in finite structures like molecules , has largely been limited to their fingerprints , i.e. those vibrations which involve only a handful of closely bonded atoms within the structure ( functional groups ) and usually fall above 500 @xmath6 ( e.g. see colthup et al .",
    "molecular phonons differ from fingerprints in that they involve the whole structure ; their spectra are quasi - periodic and extend from @xmath020 to more than @xmath1 m ( depending on molecular size ) and so may contribute to the continuum that is observed to underly the uib spectra of galaxies and planetary nebulae : see , for instance , smith et al .",

    "low - frequency phonons are presently of particular interest to astrophysics as electromagnetic emission in the microwave / millimeter ranges has now been detected , measured and surveyed all over the sky ( e.g. see finkbeiner et al .",

    "@xcite , analyzing data from the _ planck _ astronomical satellite , obtained quasi - continuous spectra from 20 to 3000 ghz ( 100 to 15000 @xmath2 m ) . in this range ,",
    "several emission sources appear to be in action : thermal dust , spinning and magnetic dust ( draine and lazarian ( 1998 ) , lazarian and draine ( 2000 ) ) , free - free electrons , synchrotron .",
    "much effort has gone into combining these various sources so as to fit observations .",
    "the purpose , here , is more limited and focused on molecular vibrations that may be excited either thermally or otherwise .",
    "we seek to define the physical ( structure , size ) and chemical ( composition ) conditions to be met by a molecule for its low - frequency vibrations to contribute significantly to the observed spectra , and to determine the nature of the vibrations involved .",
    "this also differs from papoular @xcite and @xcite , in which the maximum wavelength was 1000 @xmath2 m and only a mixture of molecules was considered but not their respective contributions to the emission .",
    "also , this work can be considered a first step in extrapolating the extinction curve of carbonaceous dust into the microwave range .",
    "fortunately , the study of molecular phonons is now made easier by computer modeling of finite , but very large , bonded structures ( hundreds of atoms ) .",
    "in the course of such an investigation , it turned out that the frequency dependences of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , for the transverse acoustic phonons of 1d and 2d molecules , differed from the well - known debye laws for the case of bulk media ( see kittel 2005 : @xmath7 and @xmath4 constant , in the limit of low frequencies , in which we are primarily interested here ) . while 2d molecules could be likened superficially to very thin plates ,",
    "the theoretical treatment of the latter involves young s modulus and poisson s ratio ( see reddy 2007 ) so it can not be extended to molecules .",
    "based on the study of the transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons ( ta and la , respectively ) of simple linear structures , it is shown here that the reason for this behavior of untethered molecules is that the vibrational mechanics is dominated by the force which resists bond bending , so the sound speed increases with frequency , by contrast with the constant sound speed in crystals ( sec .",
    "2 ) .    in most cases , the topological complexity of the structure does not allow direct analysis of motion for each individual phonons ; only the dom is readily available from modeling .",
    "but what is needed to predict the lowest natural frequency of a given structure as a function of its size , will turn out to be the sound velocity .",
    "a mathematical analysis of the general case led us to a simple formula by means of which @xmath4 can be derived from the sole knowledge of @xmath3 . at low frequencies , @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "are governed by power laws ; another outcome of our analysis is a set of relations between the dimensionality of the structure , the type of forces in action and the indexes of the two power laws which govern @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( sec . 3 ) .",
    "note that the mentioned dimensionality refers here to the carbonaceous backbone of a molecule .    in sec .",
    "4 , the theory developed in sec . 3",
    "is applied to several 2d molecules which are shown to obey the predicted relations even though they may be bent and/or warped .",
    "the lowest phonon frequency ( always that of a ta phonon ) is shown to scale like the square of the major dimension of the molecule . in sec .",
    "5 , the theory is further illustrated with several individual molecules .    in sec .",
    "6 , the integrated band intensity ( absorption ) spectrum is computed for several large molecules .",
    "the corresponding extinction cross - section per h atom in the ism ( interstellar medium ) is computed .",
    "the absorption spectrum is used in sec . 7 to obtain the emission spectrum of a particle in thermal equilibrium with its environment .",
    "the case where the particle is too small to reach thermal equilibrium is then considered , detailing a procedure used to obtain the corresponding emission spectrum , which is distinctly different than in the previous case .",
    "it is concluded that reasonable amounts of c atoms locked in similar structures are sufficient to emit detectable radiation as far as 4000    at least .",
    "in the course of this work , a large number of carbonaceous molecules were simulated by means of various algorithms of computational organic chemistry as embodied in the hyperchem software provided by hypercube , inc . , and described in detail in their publication hc50 - 00 - 03 - 00 .",
    "the semi - empirical ( mixed quantum / classical ) pm3 method , initially developed by j. p. stewart @xcite , was used throughout , as its algorithms are specially optimized for carbonaceous structures ; its accuracy for vibrational frequencies is a few percent",
    ". it does not require the initial selection and setting of particular force fields .",
    "the procedure for each molecule is as follows .",
    "first , the molecule is schematically represented on the computer screen .",
    "then , the code is prompted to optimize the molecular configuration by adjusting the various bond lengths and angles so as to minimize the total bond energy .",
    "at that point , a normal mode analysis can be automatically performed , which delivers the wave number and integrated band intensity ( oscillator strength ) of each vibrational mode of the system .    as an example , consider a linear chain of 20 doubly - bonded carbon atoms , = c=. in order to impose a strict dimensionality of 1 , it is terminated at each end with @xmath8c - h ; this is an ansatz provided by the simulation code under `` allow arbitrary valence '' or `` allow ions '' , and boils down to adding a local electric charge .",
    "two alternative terminations were also used : ch2 and c = o , and gave similar results .",
    "the atomic motions were monitored on the screen for each normal mode found by the code .",
    "three types of motion were found : a ) transverse atomic displacements parallel to the screen plane ; b ) transverse displacements orthogonal to that plane ; c ) longitudinal displacements parallel to the central line .",
    "the first two types have essentially identical frequencies , the third has distinct frequencies shifted higher up . in all 3 cases , the amplitudes of atomic excursions display , all along the chain , a clear stationary sinusoidal pattern of standing waves which can be associated with harmonic waves traveling in opposite directions , whose wavelength along the chain decreases with increasing frequency . at each transition from one normal mode to the next , the number of half sinusoids abruptly increases by one .",
    "this is in line with the classical analysis of regular crystal lattices ( see kittel 2005 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to introduce here , too , the notions of phonon and wave vector @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the wavelength of the phonon at the corresponding angular frequency , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency ( wavenumber ) and c is the velocity of light in vacuum ; the density of modes , @xmath13 , like the density of states ( dos ) , can also be defined as the number of normal modes per unit frequency . by definition ,",
    "the phase velocity is then @xmath14 . if the normal modes are labeled by integer @xmath15 , starting from 1 , in order of increasing frequency , then @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the length of the chain ; hence @xmath18 .",
    "a careful monitoring of the vibrational patterns shows that the expression for @xmath19 must be divided by a factor @xmath20 , which depends slightly on the molecular length and terminations , but remains in the range of 1.5 to 2 ( here , 1.73 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the present cases , the boundary conditions are not forced upon the molecule by stretching it between two fixed points , but are determined by the electrical properties of the h termination at each end of the chain ; as a result , the chain ends do not coincide with nodes of the standing wave .",
    "figure [ fig : transv15 ] shows , as a function of the frequency , @xmath12 : a ) the wave vector , @xmath21 ; b)the dom , @xmath3 ; c ) the sound velocity , @xmath14 , of the transverse vibrations , for atomic displacements parallel ( @xmath22 ) and perpendicular ( + ) to the screen plane , all from the modeling of the chain of 20 doubly - bonded c atoms . as expected , there is a near coincidence of the 2 sets of points in each of graphs b and c .",
    "these vibrations , of course , are reminiscent of plate vibrations , and correspond to the transverse acoustic ( ta ) waves of solid state physics .",
    "note the sound speed variation at low frequencies .",
    "this trend is confirmed by the modeling of six other linear doubly - bonded carbon chains , made of 12 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 120 and 160 c atoms , and terminated with ch2 at each end . the same procedure as above yields the ta sound velocities drawn in fig .",
    "2 , together with that of fig .",
    "[ fig : transv15 ] ( for the sake of clarity , only one of the two sets of transverse vibrations is included ) . to the accuracy of the procedure ,",
    "all 7 sound velocities are nearly coincident , except for the chain of fig .",
    "[ fig : transv15 ] , which is only slightly different , this being due to the different terminations . as expected",
    ", @xmath4 is nearly independent of the chain length .",
    "the logarithmic scales highlight the power - law dependence of the sound speed on frequency at low frequencies , @xmath23 .    returning to fig .",
    "[ fig : transv15 ] , note that the dom goes to infinity at @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath6 ; correlatively , by the definitions of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 goes to 0 .",
    "these are the only singularities predicted by van hove @xcite for infinite linear chains . with finite chains ,",
    "however , another type of singularity occurs near the minimum of the dom at @xmath26 , characterized by a gap in mode frequencies , wider or narrower depending on the type of terminations .",
    "this is due to a chance resonance between one ta mode and any other strong mode of the system , which gives rise to a strong mixed mode .",
    "the latter then perturbs the distribution of neighboring modes by pushing them aside .",
    "this in turn , locally disturbs the dom and sound speed , all the more where the dom is low , as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : transv15 ] . in the present case , this occurs for the second longitudinal mode at 439 @xmath6 , which resonates with transverse modes at 442.6 and 443 @xmath6 , as shown by the following study of longitudinal acoustic ( la ) branch of vibrations .      in monitoring , on the computer screen , atomic displacements relative to the chain backbone , in each normal mode , it is straightforward to distinguish longitudinal from transversal vibrations .",
    "[ fig : longit15 ] shows the behavior of wave vector , dom and sound velocity for the longitudinal vibrations of the same structure : by contrast with the case of transverse vibrations , the latter two are nearly constant at low frequencies .",
    "note that , in the familiar case of 3d media , while @xmath4 behaves likewise , @xmath27 , for its part , scales like @xmath28 , instead .",
    "remarkably , the sound speed of longitudinal waves is an order of magnitude higher than that of the transversal ones . as a consequence ,",
    "the first longitudinal mode occurs at a much higher frequency than its transverse counterpart .",
    "the second is the one that causes the frequency gap in fig .",
    "[ fig : transv15 ] , as explained above .",
    "there is also a gap in the longitudinal spectrum , but again at a much higher frequency , 855 @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", it is due to interaction with a strong ch bending mode , which is clearly revealed on the modeling screen , at the chain end .    in this work ,",
    "modes involving strong motions of terminal heteroatoms , and extending only slightly into the chain , were observed on all structures .",
    "they occur at the high frequency end of the transverse phonon spectral range , where end modes are strongly coupled to the last transverse mode .",
    "they are reminiscent of the `` surface '' modes studied by wallis @xcite , who showed that they can affect the thermal properties of very small powder grains . here , however , these modes are relatively very few , so they were not given particular attention , especially considering that we are primarily interested in larger grains and lower frequencies .    also note the absence of an optical phonon branch , as the atoms on the chain are identical .",
    "now , why should the velocity of transverse waves depend on the wave number , as documented above ?",
    "a plausible surmise is that the main stress acting on the transverse vibrations considered above is not the internal longitudinal tension ( since the string is not stretched ) but that which is induced by the bending of adjacent atomic bonds .",
    "it is known , indeed , that , for each atom type , there is a preferred angular distribution of the valence electrons . in the present case ,",
    "the double bonds on both sides of an atom resist any stress that tends to bend their alignment .",
    "molecular mechanics models ( charmm , gaussian , etc . ) account for this by introducing explicitly potential term in @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the bending angle . in semi - empirical modeling codes , like pm3 here , the effect automatically results from the quantal description of the valence electrons . in the present instance , by noting the increase , @xmath31 , in potential energy upon bending one of the pairs of bonds step by step from 0 to 5 deg , it was found that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 erg / rad@xmath34 ( 8@xmath35 kcal / mol / deg@xmath34 ) and @xmath30 is in radians .",
    "let us assume that this is the only potential at work , and postulate for @xmath30 a trial solution in the form of a traveling wave , expi(@xmath36 ) , where @xmath37 is an integer designating the rank of an atom in the chain , and @xmath38 the distance between adjacent atoms , 1.28   .",
    "also , let @xmath39 be the transverse displacement of the @xmath37th carbon atom along the chain .",
    "then , the angular displacement of the adjacent c = c bond relative to the chain s backbone is @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the total potential and kinetic energies of the system are , respectively ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the atomic mass , and it was assumed that @xmath44 is not dependent on the @xmath45 s .",
    "one can then write an independent lagrange s equation of the form @xmath46 for each c atom in the chain , which gives the condition of existence of the trial solution : @xmath47 the best fit of this to @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig : transv15 ] indeed requires @xmath33 erg / rad@xmath34 and is drawn as a line superimposed on the dots .",
    "the maximum angular frequency obtains for @xmath49 ( i.e. when the phonon wavelength reaches its minimum , @xmath50 ) and is then @xmath51 the inflexion point @xmath52 is at @xmath53 rad / s , where @xmath3 is minimum and @xmath4 maximum , as confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : transv15 ] .",
    "the interpretation of the modeling results for transverse vibrations is therefore validated .",
    "the physical reason for the variation of @xmath4 is that the degree of bending of the molecule depends on @xmath21 and , therefore , on @xmath5 .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to the longitudinal vibrations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : longit15 ] . here",
    "the stretching potential involved is quadratic in the variable @xmath38 : @xmath54 .",
    "however , the fit of @xmath48 now requires @xmath55 as in the classical treatment of solids , with @xmath56 erg / cm@xmath34 ( 617 kcal / mol /   @xmath34 ) and @xmath58 rad / s in the present instance . while the near constancy of @xmath4 at low frequencies naturally derives from this equation ,",
    "the near constancy of @xmath3 is intriguing .",
    "the reason for it will become clear below .    note that , in both the transverse and longitudinal cases , the power index of @xmath21 is even , indicating the existence of two waves traveling in opposite directions for each resonant frequency .    in dealing with more complex molecular structures ,",
    "it is no longer possible , by simple monitoring of each vibration on the computer screen , to distinguish phonons belonging to the same family , determine their wave vector , @xmath21 , and apply the same procedure .",
    "the sole quantity that can still be clearly defined and computed is the dom .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented as described next .",
    "consider first a periodic structure in @xmath59 dimensions , with size @xmath60 in every dimension .",
    "let @xmath61 be the wave vector of vibration @xmath15 . according to the born - von karman ( cyclic ) boundary conditions",
    ", the structure can only sustain waves such that its length is an integral number of half - wavelengths .",
    "then , the number of possible vibrations , or states of the system , with @xmath62 is    @xmath63    where the factor 2 in the numerator accounts for the fact that @xmath21 can be positive as well as negative .",
    "then , the density of modes around @xmath64 ( in @xmath21-space ) is @xmath65 and the dom is @xmath66 hence , @xmath67 let @xmath68 , which is also the phonon rank when the phonons are sorted in order of increasing frequency . then @xmath69 and @xmath70 thus , @xmath21 and , more importantly , @xmath4 , can be derived directly from the dom , which , for large , complex molecules , is the only readily computable quantity .",
    "note that @xmath3 and @xmath71 are proportional to the total number of modes @xmath72 , which is known to be nearly equal to 3 times the number of atoms ( for large molecules ) .",
    "this , in turn is proportional to the `` volume '' of the molecule ( for molecules of the same structure ) , i.e. the product of all the dimensions,@xmath73 .",
    "therefore , in the general case where all dimensions are not equal in size , @xmath60 in eq .",
    "12 should be equated with the geometric mean of the dimensions , @xmath74 . in any case",
    ", the dependencies of @xmath3 and @xmath71 on @xmath60 cancel out the factor @xmath60 in eq .",
    "12 , so the phonon velocity is in fact independent of size , as it should . on the other hand , the longest wavelength sustained by the structure",
    "is not determined by @xmath60 but by the longest dimension of the structure .",
    "this treatment is only valid in spectral ranges where no overlapping of vibrational modes of different types ( transverse / longitudinal ) occur , which is only the case for the lowest - frequency transverse phonons . in that case",
    ", the results of the theoretical treatment for the speed of transverse waves agree with those of chemical modeling to better than a factor 2 .",
    "this difference itself can be traced back to the absence of the correcting factor @xmath20 ( sec . 2.1 ) in the calculations , because of the assumed born - karman conditions .",
    "now , since we are only interested in the lowest frequencies , we are entitled to set , as suggested by the log - log graph in fig . 2 , and as an approximation , @xmath75 it follows that @xmath76 and , finally , @xmath77    thus , in 3d ( @xmath78 ) homogeneous media , the velocity is constant ( as are the density and elastic constants ) , so @xmath79 and , hence , @xmath80 , as first shown by debye . on the other hand , for the 1d chains considered above @xmath81 so @xmath82 , as found for both transverse and longitudinal vibrations , while both are 0 for the longitudinal ones .",
    "there is no apparent reason why @xmath59 should be restricted to integers .",
    "in fact , both @xmath83 and @xmath43 are determined not only by the dimension @xmath59 , but also by the dominant force governing the mechanics of the structure .",
    "the latter translates into the power index , @xmath84 , in the relation @xmath85 for low frequencies , as in eq . 4 ( bending force ) and 6 ( stretching force ) , which cover the more usual cases for common molecules . in these cases ,",
    "@xmath86 and 1 , respectively .",
    "an immediate consequence is @xmath87 the fundamental , independent parameters of the problem are @xmath59 and @xmath84 . while the dom depends on both , the velocity power index does not depend on @xmath59 , which may take any value between 1 and 3 . as a consequence , while @xmath43 can have a wide range of values , @xmath83 is essentially constrained to two values , 0.5 and 0 , corresponding to transverse and longitudinal vibrations respectively .",
    "non - integer values of @xmath59 occur when , for instance , the structure consists in chains of catacondensed single carbon rings ; @xmath59 then lies between 1 and 2 , because , strictly , the structure is neither 1d nor 2d . in such cases",
    ", the constraint on @xmath83 helps lifting the ambiguity in @xmath59 .",
    "some of these results are illustrated next .",
    "the minimum ( or fundamental ) phonon frequency , @xmath88 , is that for which @xmath89 , where @xmath20 is the correction factor for boundary effects ( sec .",
    "2 ) . now , if @xmath85 ( sec .",
    "3 ) , then it follows that @xmath90 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath91    the corresponding mode is always that of a transverse phonon , because the stress governing longitudinal waves is stronger than that which governs transverse waves , making their velocity higher .",
    "if the velocity were independent of frequency ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 would simply scale like the inverse of the molecular size , but this condition is far from common , except for 3d structures ; as indicated above , for ta modes in 1d and 2d , the common value of @xmath84 is 0.5 .    in order to study relation 17 for more complex molecules than the linear ones in sec . 2 ,",
    "15 molecules were built , with backbones made up of 5- and 6-membered carbon rings , 16 to 42    in major dimension ( see appendix ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lmolnu15 ] collects the minimum wave numbers delivered by their normal mode analysis , as a function of molecular size .",
    "although the structures are quite different and most of them are not plane , but bent and warped , a clear trend is apparent .",
    "the linear fit shown is @xmath94 in @xmath6 and   , which is good to a factor 2 . for @xmath12 in ghz",
    ", the pre - factor would be @xmath95 .",
    "on the other hand , inserting the same data ( @xmath96 ) directly into eq .",
    "17 , and plotting @xmath97 against @xmath93 , one obtains fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv15 ] . superimposed upon the dots is a linear fit to this plot : @xmath98 whose exponent is close to the expected one , in agreement with the finding in sec .",
    "3 that @xmath99 is constrained to 0.5 for transverse waves .",
    "the `` average '' velocity is close to the velocity found for linear molecules , indicating that the dominant force in both 1d and 2d is that which resists bending , and that boundary effects are limited .",
    "application of eq .",
    "12 to individual molecules confirms this result , as illustrated by examples in the following section .    if @xmath100 is assumed to be the exact value , then eq .",
    "17 leads to @xmath101 , with which eq .",
    "18 agrees within error bars .",
    "a number of causes may contribute to the dispersion of data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmolnu15 ] and [ fig : nuv15 ] : a ) @xmath17 is not clearly defined _ a priori _ , unless the molecule is definitely a straight line or a plane surface ; b ) @xmath93 is uncertain because of larger code errors at low frequencies and of mode coupling with fingerprint or longitudinal vibrations ; c ) boundary effects and uncertainty on the correction factor @xmath20 ; d ) the velocity at a given frequency depends on mass ( through @xmath43 ) , density ( through @xmath38 ) and bonding force strength ( through @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) , all of which depend on the particular structure .",

    "18 or fig .",
    "[ fig : lmolnu15 ] .",
    "thus , in order to contribute absorption / emission around 100 ghz and beyond , a structure has to be larger than about 40   .    for a periodic chain of n atoms , the maximum phonon frequency corresponds to a vibration wavelength about equal to the atomic periodicity , @xmath38 . for a ta phonon on a carbon chain ,",

    "in order to assess the spectroscopic detectability of these phononic vibrations , it is necessary to evaluate the intensity of the attending electromagnetic signal , if any .",
    "this depends , of course on the particulars of the molecules at hand .",
    "however , some general properties can be identified .",
    "the following study is restricted to carbon - based molecules which are 1- or 2-dimensional in the broad sense ( i.e. not necessarily straight or plane , which is the case of most molecules in space ) .",
    "after optimization of the structure , the modeling software that is used here performs a normal mode analysis which delivers all mode frequencies with the corresponding integrated absorption intensities , @xmath114 in km / mole ( 1 mole=6.024@xmath115 molecules ) .",
    "this is related to the absorptivity , @xmath116 , of a gas of identical molecules by @xmath117 where @xmath116 is in @xmath6 , c is the molecular density ( mole / l ) and @xmath118 , the band width of the band at @xmath12 , in @xmath6 . for a large assembly of molecules of the same family but slightly different from one another , so as to produce a quasi - continuous vibrational spectrum , it can be shown ( papoular 2014b ) that @xmath119 for astrophysical applications , it is often more convenient to consider the extinction cross - section per h atom , @xmath120 , which is related to @xmath116 by @xmath121 where @xmath120 is in cm@xmath34 , @xmath20 is the fraction of carbon atoms locked in dust , @xmath122 is the cosmic abundance of carbon relative to hydrogen , @xmath123 is the average number of c atoms in one dust particle and @xmath124 is the density of dust particle in space ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "we now set out to estimate @xmath120 for wavelengths beyond about 1000 @xmath2 m .",

    "two categories of transverse phonons can be distinguished : a ) those with @xmath126 between about 0.01 and 0.1 km / mol ; b ) the `` suppressed '' ones , with @xmath126 one or several order of magnitude weaker .",
    "the distinction and the gap in @xmath126 are particularly clear for the shortest chain . a careful study of this case shows that the strongest ( respectively the weakest ) intensities are associated with odd ( respectively , even ) numbers of half - wavelengths along the chain , corresponding to constructive ( respectively , destructive ) combinations of atomic excursions .",
    "this effect weakens as the chain length increases , progressively reducing the range of intensities from below .    a third phonon category , the `` enhanced '' phonons , is discernible in the figure , as the wave number increases , but is more obvious when the molecular geometry favors the edges relative to the backbone or when the edges involve more infrared - active functional groups like oh for instance . in all these instances ,",
    "the edge atoms dominate the molecular polarizability .",
    "similar trends are observed in fig.[fig : cor1717nue ] , obtained from the modeling of the 17@xmath2217 benzene cluster of fig.[fig : cor1717nugv ] . in this case , however , the absorption intensities of the low - frequency phonons are an order of magnitude higher and more and more high intensities occur as the frequency increases .",
    "both effects are due to the increased number of atoms and to the presence of a larger relative number of edge hydrogen atoms .    from the consideration of these , and the other structures modeled in this work , and in view of the computational difficulty of increasing sizes",
    ", it may tentatively be concluded that the intensities of the lowest - frequency ( transverse ) phonons , for carbon based molecules in general , tend to flock around a constant value as the frequency decreases .",
    "this value lies between 0.01 and 0.1 km / mol for molecules with @xmath81 , and 0.1 to 1 for structures with @xmath108 .    as for the density of modes , @xmath27 , which also appears in eq .",

    "22 , together with @xmath135 , and @xmath136 ( see comments above in this section ) , one finally gets @xmath137 if one takes @xmath138 , as did papoular @xcite to model the high galactic latitude diffuse emission , then @xmath139 cm@xmath34/h atom , independent of frequency and slightly weaker than the value found in that work for the longest wavelength , @xmath140",
    "m this confirms the preliminary conclusion drawn in papoular @xcite , to the effect that the extinction cross - section of carbon - rich dust particles levels off beyond a few hundred micrometers .",
    "it must be recalled that this extinction estimate is only valid to as long a wavelength as allowed by the maximum size of the particles present in the dust ( eq .",
    "18 ) . towards shorter wavelengths ,",
    "extinction progressively increases as functional group modes set in with increasing density and intensity , and the extinction settles into a logarithmic power law with index @xmath103 between 1 and 2 , depending on environment .",
    "knowing the integrated intensity spectrum of a molecule , it becomes possible to compute its emission spectrum if the excitation process is also known .",
    "the simplest case is that of thermal equilibrium with the environment at a given temperature .",
    "the emission spectrum is then obtained by multiplying the black body spectrum with the absorption cross - section ( eq .",
    "an example of this procedure is given below .",
    "however , for this to be valid , the excitation rate must be strong enough to reach statistical equilibrium between emission and excitation processes . for low intensities of ambient radiation ( g = g@xmath141 )",
    ", this implies that the absorption cross - section of the molecule is large enough ( size larger than 0.1 - 1 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "otherwise , before the molecule radiatively relaxes , it has time to settle in a state of internal statistical equilibrium , wherein the deposited excitation energy is continuously flowing between vibrational modes , but the energy in each mode remains constant on average . roughly speaking , its emission spectrum will cover the range between 20 @xmath2 m and @xmath142 , the maximum wavelength in the phonon spectrum : this range will often turn out to be much wider than that of a black or gray body .    to illustrate this case , we select 3 organic molecules built up of 1 , 3 and 6 `` trios '' ( see the appendix ) arranged in a row so that their lengths turn out to be 9 , 25 and 50   , and their @xmath142 to be 369 , 1275 and 5097 , respectively , as shown in fig .",

    "they are meant to typify groups of dust particles of similar structure and sizes .",
    "the peak of integrated absorption which protrudes between 20 and 60 @xmath2 m is a fingerprint of the oh groups attached to each trio , which are expected to be common in the ism .",
    "now , it was shown ( papoular 2012 ) that the energy density ultimately radiated by an isolated molecule after it has been excited by radiation or collision that deposited an energy @xmath143 in it , and after it has promptly relaxed into internal statistical equilibrium , is    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the fraction of energy staying on average in mode @xmath12 and @xmath43 is the total electric dipole moment of the molecule .",
    "it should be remembered that the latter ( in the ground state of the molecule ) is linked to the integrated band intensity , @xmath126 ( km / mol ) , by @xmath146 stressing the intimate connection between emission and absorption . the modeling package used here provides for computing both distributions @xmath145 and @xmath147 .",
    "these are obtained in 3 successive runs of molecular dynamics :    \\a ) after optimizing the ground state of the selected molecule , the latter is given an energy @xmath143 and left in vacuum to relax into its internal statistical equilibrium , which is reached within a few tens of picoseconds .",
    "b)a second run is then launched , during which the fluctuations of the total kinetic energy in time are monitored .",
    "the fourier transform of this delivers half the steady state kinetic energy distribution ( e(@xmath12 ) ) among the modes , the other half being in the form of potential energy .",
    "this run must be at least twice as long as the period of the lowest frequency phonon .",
    "c)a third run is launched to monitor the temporal fluctuations of the total dipole moment .",

    "it has not proved possible to study longer molecules , as presently available modeling codes can not handle particles larger than a few hundred atoms .",
    "however , the spectral extension to longer wavelengths clearly increases with the length of the molecule as suggested by sec . 4 and illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : endmspec ] of appendix b. now , after the molecule has been excited in a bath at 20 k ( equivalent to a thermal spike ) , and left free in vacuum , it is found to rotate with an angular velocity of 2.3@xmath35 rad / ps ( @xmath00.37 ghz ) .",
    "this is well within the range considered by lazarian and draine @xcite both for their resonant relaxation and for davis - greenstein paramagnetic relaxation mechanisms .    in the former mechanism , alignment in a magnetic field",
    "occurs through rotation relaxation because of spin - lattice interaction .",
    "this requires that a quantum of rotation energy may be absorbed by the lattice , i.e. that resonance may occur between rotation and one of the lattice vibrations , for instance . for the 6-trios molecule considered here ,",
    "this is not possible because the lowest vibrational frequency in the present example , is 60 ghz , much higher than the rotation frequency , 0.37 ghz .",
    "if a bigger molecule is considered or some mechanism operates to give this molecule a higher rotation energy , then spin - lattice relaxation might become effective .",
    "anyhow , assume some alignment mechanism is at work and forces the molecular rotation vector to lie parallel with the galactic magnetic field , which , in turn is supposed to be perpendicular to the sight line . in this picture , therefore , one component of the dipole moment lies along the magnetic field while the other two are randomly oriented in the plane perpendicular to this direction and containing the sight line.three polarization fractions can then be deduced , according to which dipole moment component is parallel to the magnetic field :    @xmath159    plotting the 3 quantities as a function of frequency , it is found that they oscillate between 0.4 to 0.95 at the phonon frequencies and nearly zero in between . considering a family of similar molecules , differing only in length , and thus increasing the density of phononic states ,",
    "one expects each polarization to retain high values throughout the spectrum .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that this is assuming perfect alignment and rigid structures .",
    "this whole exercise is only meant to show the potential of this type of molecules as polarized emitters in the ame spectral range .",

    "their building blocks are simple enough that they may be synthesized in the laboratory and in space .",
    "their vibrational spectra were obtained by normal mode analysis .",
    "the focus was set upon those vibrations that extend over the whole structure ( phonons ) , setting aside fingerprints due to small , inevitable , functional groups ( contributing to the high frequency end of the spectrum ) .",
    "transverse and longitudinal acoustic vibrations of the simplest structures could be separated by monitoring the atomic motions of each mode .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of their dom and sound velocity toward low frequencies were found to obey power - laws in the frequency , with indexes @xmath43 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "for the transverse vibrations , these indexes differ from the solid state values , 2 and 0 .",
    "it was shown that this is so because the force governing the motion is that which resists bending of c - c bonds .",
    "the intensity of this force was confirmed independently . because this force is weaker than the stretching force of c - c bonds ,",

    "it is hardly possible to separate phonons of different types .",
    "the only quantity readily available from modeling is the dom .",
    "section 3 gives a general formula from which the sound velocity can be derived , given the dom .",
    "application of this formula requires the knowledge of the dimensionality , @xmath59 , of the structure . for common structures , warped and finite",
    ", this notion is not as straightforward as it appears to be : @xmath59 is not always an integer , 1 or 2 , but rather lies in between .",
    "it was shown that the ambiguity can be lifted by using a general relation between @xmath43 , @xmath59 and @xmath83 .",
    "these results were illustrated by the study of several structures of different types ( but not crystalline ) .",
    "it was found that the ta sound velocity always scales like @xmath160 , so the lowest frequency in a spectrum scales like @xmath161 , where @xmath17 is the longest straight dimension of the structure .",
    "the extinction cross - section of carbon - rich particles was shown to level off progressively beyond about 100 @xmath2 m ( @xmath1623000 ghz ) , and was estimated at @xmath163 cm@xmath34/h atom , in order of magnitude , in this spectral range .",
    "the results obtained above can readily be used to deduce emission spectra , assuming the ambient radiation density is high enough ( or the dust particle large enough ) that it reaches thermal equilibrium before re - radiating the energy gained . in the opposite case , the emission spectrum can be deduced from the monitoring of the temporal fluctuations of the total electric dipole moment after the molecule has been excited . from spectra computed in this way for molecules up to 50    in length , it is concluded that reasonable amounts of c atoms locked in similar structures are sufficient to emit detectable radiation as far as 4000 @xmath2 m at least .",
    "presently available modeling codes can hardly handle larger particles , but the theoretical analysis indicates that molecules 120    in length are needed to cover the whole spectral range thought to be dominated by dust emission , before free - free bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission prevail .",
    "the primary application of this work is to the extension of the interstellar extinction curve and the variation of its slope .",

    "one could also envision , in the future , an application to the elucidation of the sources and properties of ame .",

    "another challenge is to determine the cause(s ) of emission polarization in the spectral range of interest .",
    "the present work indicates that large carbon - rich molecules may contribute significant polarized phonon emission in that range .",
