    "the finest level at which micromixing in fluid flows can be investigated is determined by the local gradient of a scalar .",
    "the gradient indeed rules molecular diffusion , but also gives a precise insight into the small - scale structure of scalar fields and mixing patterns .",
    "actually , it is the mean dissipation rate of the energy of scalar fluctuations , @xmath0 , the so - called scalar dissipation  with @xmath1 the molecular diffusivity and @xmath2 the scalar gradient  , which reveals the efficiency of micromixing .",
    "modelling small - scale mixing in process and chemical engineering @xcite or in combustion flow computation @xcite thus needs to understand the very mechanisms of scalar gradient production . on the basic level ,",
    "the study of the scalar gradient is relevant to the general problem of vector transport in fluid flows @xcite including the kinematics of vectors defining material lines or surfaces @xcite , the vorticity vector properties @xcite , the dynamics of the vorticity gradient in two - dimensional flows @xcite as well as the production of the magnetic field by the motion of a conducting fluid @xcite .    a number of studies have tackled the connection of the detailed features of the scalar gradient and of the scalar dissipation with the properties of the flow field determined by the local velocity gradients @xcite . clearly , in scalar gradient production , strain  through its intensity , persistence and the respective alignments of scalar gradient and principal axes  is the chief mechanism , while vorticity , at least its magnitude , is immaterial . because of the tight interaction between strain and vorticity @xcite , however , vorticity properties are likely to be indirectly involved .",
    "in fact , the role of strain in the vicinity of vorticity structures has early been established @xcite .",
    "models based on stretched vortices @xcite have also been shown to reproduce the physics of scalar transport and mixing in turbulent flows .",
    "more recently the influence of vortical structures on mixing has been clearly shown @xcite .",
    "the present work , too , has to do with the relationship between mixing properties and the local features of the flow field .",
    "the production of scalar dissipation , and thus the mechanisms of micromixing , are probed through the kinematic features of the scalar gradient in terms of vorticity geometry .",
    "since vorticity alignments arise from the dynamics of the velocity field and are closely connected to the inner , detailed structure of turbulent flows @xcite , alignment of vorticity with respect to strain principal axes is especially considered .",

    "@xcite the kolmogorov time scale and the scalar integral time scale are respectively prescribed as @xmath20  which corresponds to a taylor microscale reynolds number , @xmath21 , close to 150 @xcite  and @xmath22 .",

    "the calculation is run for @xmath23 with time step @xmath24 and the statistics of the velocity and scalar gradients are derived from their respective stationary time signals .",
    "the model retrieves the main features of the scalar gradient statistics and kinematics @xcite , namely the non - gaussian properties of the scalar gradient components , the probability density functions ( p.d.f.s ) of the production of scalar gradient norm , the statistical alignments with respect to strain principal axes and vorticity as well as more subtle features already underlined in two - dimensional turbulence @xcite such as the existence of special preferential alignments .",
    "it has also been shown to reproduce the statistics of the scalar gradient in rotating turbulence @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian approach has been used to model the evolution of the turbulent magnetic field as well @xcite .",
    "additional assessment of the model in connection with the present study relates to statistics conditioned on vorticity alignments .",

    "as scalar dissipation is in direct proportion to the square of the scalar gradient norm , production mechanisms of scalar gradient reveal the way in which it is promoted by the flow field . using the model , we specifically focus on the case of significant alignment of vorticity with the strain principal axes .",
    "the latter is defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a threshold spanning the range 0.7 to 0.99 and alignment of vorticity with a strain eigenvector , @xmath26 , is denoted by @xmath40 . the major part ",
    "92%  of the results corresponds to vorticity making an angle smaller than @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) with one of the strain eigenvectors ; more precisely , 22% for @xmath43 , 55% for @xmath44 and 15% for @xmath45 .",
    "vorticity aligning with @xmath31 is mostly stretched ; the intermediate eigenvalue , @xmath34 , is positive in more than @xmath46 of the @xmath47-events ",
    "83% for @xmath48 , 86% for @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] clearly shows the dependence of scalar gradient production on vorticity alignments . the averages of the scalar gradient norm , @xmath50 , and of its production term , @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the strain tensor ) , conditioned on @xmath38 display the same trend : their largest values correspond to strong alignment of vorticity with @xmath31 , while mean values conditioned on alignment with @xmath30 are closer to the unconditioned averaged values .",
    "alignment of vorticity with the compressional eigenvector , @xmath32 , corresponds to the smallest production .",
    "these results thus suggest that the most intense scalar dissipation occurs for @xmath47 , while the mean scalar dissipation is rather well represented by the set of events for which @xmath53 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , when vorticity aligns with a strain eigenvector the intermediate strain causes destruction of the scalar gradient , and the compressional and the extensional strains , as expected , essentially cause production and destruction , respectively .",
    "in addition , the differences in scalar gradient production resulting from the vorticity alignments stem from rather subtle mechanisms . from fig . [ fig5 ]",
    "it is clear that both the weakest production and destruction occur for @xmath54 .",
    "production by the compressional strain as well as destruction by the extensional strain are the largest for @xmath47 , while in this latter case destruction by the intermediate strain coincides with its unconditioned value . for @xmath53 ,",
    "production by the compressional strain is close to the unconditioned mean value , destruction by the extensional strain is weak and destruction by the intermediate strain is the largest .",
    "these results are supported by the p.d.fs of @xmath50 and of the production term @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) conditioned on vorticity alignments .",
    "in particular , it is clear that extreme values of @xmath50 are the most probable when @xmath47 .",
    "it also appears that both the largest destruction and production of the scalar gradient occur in this case .",
    "the above picture is explained by both the respective intensities of the strain components and the alignments of the scalar gradient with respect to the strain principal axes ( figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath54 the scalar gradient alignment with both @xmath30 and @xmath31 is rather good , but the weak values of the intensities of the extensional and the intermediate strain result in a weak destruction . however , a small compressional strain intensity together with a poor alignment of the scalar gradient with @xmath32 also bring about a weak production .    with regard to the difference in scalar gradient production when @xmath53 or @xmath47 : the extensional strain eigenvalue is the largest and alignment of the scalar gradient with @xmath30 is the best for @xmath47 which explains the largest destruction in this case ; however , for @xmath47 , the compressional strain eigenvalue is the largest and alignment of @xmath2 with @xmath32 is slightly better which makes production larger when @xmath47 than when @xmath53 ; furthermore , because the difference in the statistics of the intermediate strain eigenvalue between cases @xmath53 and @xmath47 is small and @xmath2 aligns better with @xmath31 for @xmath53 , destruction by the intermediate strain is larger when @xmath53 . better alignment of @xmath2 with @xmath30 for @xmath47  and with @xmath31 for @xmath53  results from the trend of the scalar gradient and vorticity to be normal to each other @xcite which is predicted by the model @xcite .",
    "in addition , greater absolute values of the @xmath56 s for @xmath47 are consistent with the fact that moderate and strong production of strain occurs when vorticity strongly aligns with the intermediate strain eigenvector and is rather misaligned with respect to the extensional strain @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that strong alignment of vorticity with @xmath31 is correlated with large strain intensity .",
    "the model reproduces the latter property as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] which compares rather well with fig .",
    "9(d ) of reference @xcite .",
    "to summarize , this analysis suggests that the budget of scalar gradient production resulting in a more intense scalar dissipation for @xmath47 than for @xmath53 is explained by the following mechanisms : both extensional strain intensity and scalar gradient alignment explain the difference in the destruction of scalar gradient by the extensional strain , while alignment of the scalar gradient is the main mechanism resulting in a difference in destruction by the intermediate strain ; and the difference in the production by compressional strain is to be essentially put down to the compressional strain intensity .",
    "+      strain persistence was originally defined in two - dimensional flows @xcite .",
    "it can be extended to the three - dimensional case @xcite when vorticity is closely aligned with a strain eigenvector and used to check whether the flow is locally strain- or rotation - dominated .",
    "the strain persistence parameters are computed for @xmath57 @xmath58 and are respectively given by : @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 ; the @xmath63 s are the components of the rotation rate of strain principal axes computed as : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 where the @xmath67 s are the components of the pressure hessian tensor , @xmath68  with @xmath69 and @xmath70 standing for density and pressure , respectively  modelled as shown in section [ sec2.1 ] .",
    "hatted quantities indicate components in the strain basis .",
    "prevailing strain is defined by @xmath71 , while @xmath72 indicates prevailing rotation . by including the rotation rate of strain principal axes in addition to vorticity",
    ", strain persistence considers the effective rotation rate and was shown to give a better estimate of local stirring properties than criteria just allowing for vorticity @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms of scalar gradient production can be analysed in terms of prevailing strain _ vs. _ prevailing rotation from table [ tab1 ] . within the text conditioned mean values such as @xmath73 .",
    "[ tab1 ]    in the @xmath74-sample strain is as frequent as rotation , while the @xmath75-sample is slightly rotation - dominated which is consistent with a larger scalar dissipation for @xmath74 than for @xmath75 .",
    "this result also suggests that strain is statistically more persistent when vorticity aligns with the intermediate strain eigenvector and may explain the slightly better alignment with the compressional strain direction in this case ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . the @xmath76 sample , by contrast , is found to be strongly rotation - dominated ; in these compressed - vorticity events small compressional strain intensity together with a poor alignment of the scalar gradient with @xmath32 result in low levels of production for both prevailing strain and rotation .",
    "as expected , the largest values of @xmath77 as well as the largest production are found for @xmath53 and @xmath47 . in agreement with previous studies @xcite ,",
    "production mainly results from prevailing - strain events .",
    "however , @xmath77 is significant for prevailing rotation as it takes values greater than the unconditioned average for both @xmath53 and @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , the difference between @xmath53 and @xmath47 clearly arises from the rotation - dominated events ; the difference in @xmath77 is indeed 3.4% for @xmath78 and @xmath79  respectively , 7.95 and 8.22  , while it reaches 27% for @xmath80 and @xmath81  respectively , 5.39 and 6.85 . for @xmath54 , @xmath77 is smaller than its unconditioned value for both prevailing strain and rotation .",
    "the net production confirms the role of rotation events in the difference between cases @xmath53 and @xmath47 : the same amount , 17.4 , is found for prevailing strain , while for prevailing rotation the net production is equal to 6.36 and 9.66 , respectively , namely a difference as large as 52% . as the differences in total destruction by the extensional and the intermediate strains are of the same order for both prevailing strain and prevailing rotation , the large difference in net production for prevailing rotation is mainly explained by production resulting from the compressional strain : 12% for prevailing strain  19.7 and 22.0 for @xmath53 and @xmath47 , respectively  and 83% for prevailing rotation  8.04 and 14.7 , respectively .",
    "it is also worth noting that production for prevailing rotation when @xmath47 is not insignificant since both production by the compressional strain  14.7  and the net production ",
    "9.66  are greater than the corresponding unconditioned values , 12.0 and 9.35 , respectively .",
    "the mechanisms put forward in section [ sec4.1 ] to explain the difference in scalar gradient production between @xmath53 and @xmath47 are emphasized by prevailing rotation .",
    "the mean values of the extensional and compressional strains , @xmath82 and @xmath34 , are greater when @xmath47 than when @xmath53 for both prevailing strain and rotation , but the difference is larger for prevailing rotation : for @xmath83 the difference is 38% for prevailing strain  respectively , 1.87 and 2.58  and 63% for prevailing rotation  respectively 1.55 and 2.52 ; for @xmath84 these differences are respectively 19% and 54% .",
    "although the difference in the alignment of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath30 is almost the same for prevailing strain and prevailing rotation ",
    "27% and 28%  , the difference in the alignment with @xmath31 is larger for prevailing rotation ",
    "14% and 38% .",
    "scalar dissipation has been analysed through scalar gradient production using a stochastic lagrangian model for the velocity and the scalar gradients which reproduces the essential dynamic and kinematic properties of isotropic turbulence .",
    "the study was specifically focused on the connection between vorticity geometry and scalar dissipation , and thus small - scale mixing .",
    "the model results show that scalar dissipation is mainly found when vorticity is stretched .",
    "more precisely , for vorticity aligning with the extensional strain , scalar dissipation is close to its unconditioned mean value , while the most intense scalar dissipation  and therefore the most efficient small - scale mixing  occurs for vorticity aligning with the intermediate strain .",
    "scalar dissipation is significantly lower when vorticity is compressed .",
    "the difference in scalar dissipation when vorticity aligns with either the extensional ",
    "@xmath53  or the intermediate strain ",
    "@xmath47  is to be put down to the interplay of mechanisms involving the strain intensities and the alignment of the scalar gradient with respect to the strain principal axes . in brief , for @xmath47 both a larger extensional strain intensity and a better alignment of the the scalar gradient with the extensional strain result in a larger destruction of the scalar gradient norm than when @xmath53 ; however , this effect is exceeded by production caused by compression , essentially through a larger compressional strain intensity ; in addition , when @xmath47 it is mainly the misalignment of the scalar gradient with @xmath31 that causes a lesser destruction by the intermediate strain . for vorticity aligning with the compressional strain direction ",
