    "distance - scale determination of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) has been one of the most important achievements of astrophysics in recent years .",
    "accurate and fast localization of the prompt and afterglow emission bursts ( i.e.@xcite ) by the italian / dutch x  ray satellite bepposax ( @xcite ) led to the identification of optical counterparts ( @xcite ) and ultimately to spectral measurements of a redshift ( @xcite ) . while the extragalactic origin of grb has gathered solid evidence in its support , the source of the large energy implied by their distance is still speculative .",
    "direct information on the nature of the central engine of grb can be derived by studying the nearby environment ; for example using line spectroscopy .",
    "the star forming region and massive pre - explosion winds associated with the hypernova scenario ( @xcite ) imply a mass rich environment down to short ( @xmath3 ) distance scales .",
    "in contrast , ns - ns merging should happen in a fairly clean environment , because such objects are expected to form with significant speeds which can lead them at least a few parsecs away from the regions of star formation in which they formed .",
    "current line measurements are inconclusive , because all the spectral features observed so far are signatures produced by the host galaxy rather than at the burst site .",
    "grb980425 is an exception , but its tantalizing association with sn 1998bw ( @xcite ) requires clarification .    the measurement of x - ray lines emitted directly by the grb or its afterglow could provide a direct measurement of the distance and probe into the nature of the central environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "fe k line emission is very promising in this respect .",
    "theoretical computations have been carried out by several authors in the framework of grb ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of this work deals with features generated within the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy , i.e. on scale larger than several parsecs .",
    "however , even in the favourable case of dense regions of stellar formation ( e.g. the site of grb formation in the hypernova scenario ) , iron emission lines would be hard to detect with current x - ray instrumentation .",
    "lately , mszros and rees ( 1998 ) have shown that the circumburst environment created by the stellar wind before the explosion of the hypernova could yield a line of substantial intensity .",
    "a similarly favourable situation should be expected in a variation of the hypernova scenario ,  the supranova ( @xcite ) , where the grb is shortly preceded by a supernova explosion with the ejection of an iron  rich massive shell . in these cases , and for a isotropic distribuition of material around the source , a tight upper limit on the column density @xmath4@xmath5 derives from the requirement that the thomson optical depth be less than a few , to avoid smearing out the the short time - scale structure of the grb by thomson scattering ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , fe absorption features of stregth comparable to that in emission should also be detected .",
    "it is also conceivable that the impact of the relativistic shell that produced the original grb on these ejecta could provide an additional energy input in the afterglow .",
    "grb970508 is the most promising candidate of the bepposax afterglows for the search of line emission .",
    "it is characterized by a large outbursting event during its afterglow phase ( @xcite ) and has the highest signal to noise ratio of the bepposax grb afterglows . in this letter",
    "we present results of a spectral analysis of the afterglow of grb970508 and discuss their implications on the nature of the central engine of grb .",
    "the gamma - ray burst grb970508 was detected by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( grbm ) aboard bepposax ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wide field camera ( wfc ) provided a few arcmin position acquired with the narrow field instruments 6 hours after the burst , which led to the identification of the x - ray afterglow associated with the grb .",
    "three further observations were carried out , the last performed 6 days after the burst ( fig.1 , tab.1 ) .",
    "lecs(0.1 - 3.5 kev ) and mecs(1.8 - 10.0 kev ) spectra of the observations were obtained using standard procedures ( bepposax web pages : _",
    "www.sdc.asi.it_ ) , with 15 - 20 counts ( source + background ) per bin .",
    "inspection of the light curve ( fig.1 ) shows that in the first half period of observation number 1 the flux decays , followed by a rising trend in the second half .",
    "we have thus split this observation into two parts ( 1a & 1b ) at the time of the minimum of the light curve , to investigate spectral evolution in different states , producing 5 spectra in total .",
    "we fitted each spectrum with a power law with variable absorption , keeping the relative normalization of lecs vs mecs free to vary in the range 0.6 - 0.9 .",
    "this model provides a good fit to all but dataset 1a . in this case",
    "we have @xmath7 for @xmath8 degrees of freedom , which corresponds to a probability of 1.4%    however the major contribution to @xmath9 is not randomly distributed but is concentrated in a line feature around 3.5 kev ( fig .",
    "2a ; note that in figure we show for clarity only data points below 2 kev for lecs and above 2 kev for mecs ) .",
    "the possible association of this feature with fe k line emission is obvious , considering that its energy coincides with - k@xmath10 emission at the redshift z=0.835 , i.e. that of the putative host galaxy ( bloom et al .",
    "we have therefore added to the power law model a narrow line ( width @xmath11 fwhm@xmath12 kev ) at the energy of 3.5 kev .",
    "the relative normalization lecs / mecs  that depends primarily on the position of the source in the lecs detector has , in all datasets , an error greater than the nominal range 0.6 - 0.9 . we have hereafter fixed it to 0.8 , the value averaged over all data sets .",
    "the best fit now yields @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the improvement of @xmath15 corresponds to a confidence level of 99.3% ( f test ) .",
    "we stress that this confidence level relies on the a priori knowledge of the energy of the fe line available from an independent redshift measurement .",
    "were it not available , the confidence level for the presence of a line with free energy would have been 97% .",
    "the best fit line intensity is @xmath16 ph @xmath5s@xmath17 ( hereafter all errors and upper limits correspond to 90% confidence level for a single parameter ) .",
    "upper limits on line intensity in datasets 1b ( fig.2b ) , 2 3 and 4 are 2.5 , 2 , 2.5 and 0.5 @xmath18 ph @xmath5s@xmath17 respectively .    the power law parameters obtained in dataset 1a and 1b are consistent with each other ( see tab",
    ". 1 ) and the absorption column densities are consistent with the hydrogen column in the line of sight of our galaxy , i.e. the intrinsic absorption is consistent with zero .",
    "we next performed a simultaneous fit to both datasets with the same continuum parameters , and the addition of a line to dataset 1a only . in this case",
    "we left the energy of the line as free parameter , deriving @xmath19 , corresponding to @xmath20 in the source rest frame .",
    "the error range is too large to identify the ionization state of iron . in fig.2 ( inset )",
    "we show the contour plot of i@xmath21 vs e.    we note that the absence of the line in dataset 1b explains why a power law model provides an acceptable fit to the summed spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have also investigated whether the spectral continuum could be fitted by a black body or a thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "we find that thermal models provide worse results than that of a power law continuum , as already shown in the case of grb970228 ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectral variability of the afterglow spectra supports the idea that a refreshed energy input produced the outburst observed in the light curve . the spectral index in the first observation ( tab .",
    "1 ) is @xmath22 . in the second and third observation",
    "the flux lies above an extrapolation of the light curve expected from a power law evolution from the primary event .",
    "the spectrum is harder ( @xmath23 ) , indicating electron reacceleration , as expected in a newly formed shock . in the last observation",
    "the flux decreases and the spectrum is very steep ( @xmath24 ) : the new energy source has been exhausted .",
    "we have noticed previously that spectra 1a and 1b are consistent with each other .",
    "since the transition 1a-1b identifies the beginning of the outburst , one would then expect an hardening of the spectrum in 1b .",
    "however such an effect could be masked by the continuation of the power law decay law ( fig.1 ) , which accounts for about 60% of the flux observed in dataset 1b .",
    "the minimum amount of mass @xmath25 present can be estimated ( lazzati 1998 ) simply by counting how many ionizing photons a given iron atom can absorb , assuming that recombination is much faster than the time interval between successive ionizations , and by demanding that the existing iron atoms thus account for the fluence in the line : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the iron abundance in units of the solar value , @xmath28 is the line duration , @xmath29 is the distance of the medium from the central source , and @xmath30 is the fraction of the total energy @xmath31 which is recycled into the line . since the line disappears after about @xmath32 , we expect the emitting region to have a size @xmath33 ; in fact , since the line width is mostly instrumental , we can bar the existence of relativistic effects .",
    "then the typical density is @xmath34 , and typical thompson and iron optical depths are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "> from the above we deduce that the emitting material can not lie along the line of sight : for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and thomson scattering would smear out the time structure of the burst , contrary to observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "even if @xmath39 , we would still have @xmath40 , which implies an iron edge not seen in the spectrum .",
    "for @xmath41 , we notice that the fireball would load itself with so many baryons to spoil its relativistic expansion , again contradicting observations .",
    "having established that the emitting medium lies sideways from the line of sight , we also notice that we can not have @xmath42 , because then the line would appear much later than 1 day .",
    "we conclude that @xmath43 .",
    "the ionization parameter , using the minimum density derived above , is found to be @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the luminosity in the range 0.016 - 10 kev , whose temporal evolution is approximately described by a power law ( @xcite ) .",
    "> from eq .",
    "( 2 ) one sees that for early times ( @xmath46 ) , the material will be fully ionized , and thus the line may be due to recombination , while at later times , when @xmath47 , fluorescence may account for the emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the exact moment of the transition can not be determined , because we established above that the emitting material lies sideways with respect to the observer , and we can not exclude some amount of beaming , but the following discussion still stands . at early times , the emitting material will probably reach close to the inverse  compton temperature in the burst radiation field , which clearly exceeds @xmath48 ; for these high temperatures and low densities , recombination is not an effective emitter of line photons , and it is most likely that most of the line we see is emitted by fluorescence in the time range @xmath49 , during which the total observed fluence is @xmath50 . putting this into eq .",
    "[ min ] , we find a minimum mass of @xmath51 which is our best estimate for the total mass present .      in principle , the line might arise from the normal interstellar medium surrounding the burst volume , or from a normal stellar wind emitted by the burst progenitor .",
    "however , a very large density ( @xmath52 ) is necessary to account for the observed spectral feature ; this is obvious when one considers that the line reported here is as bright as a typical one from clusters of galaxies at @xmath53 .",
    "winds of massive stars are also unlikely to be responsible for the iron line : even for rather extreme wind parameters ( @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ) , the wind density exceeds the minimum density only for @xmath56 . however , for this small distance , the ionization parameter ( eq . [ xi ] )",
    "is @xmath57 even a day after the burst and , even including beaming , the wind material will be totally ionized ; under these conditions , only recombination can provide the line photons , but the recombination rates are very small ( @xmath58 ) , and thus the conditions of instantaneous de  excitation under which eq .",
    "[ min ] was established are no longer satisfied : much larger masses are required than can be accounted for by the winds .",
    "furthermore , such small distances ( @xmath59 ) can not explain the line duration .",
    "we thus conclude that the material surrounding the burst must have been pre  ejected .",
    "@xmath60 is likely to be close to an upper limit to the iron abundance of the ism or of a stellar wind at @xmath61 .",
    "scenarios concerning mergers of binaries then begin to appear unlikely , regardless of whether the binary is made of two neutron stars , a black hole and a neutron star , or a black hole and a white dwarf , because it has been established ( mszros and rees 1992 ) that they can not pre  eject , even under the rosiest assumptions , more than @xmath62 due to their tidal interactions , about three orders of magnitude less than the limit in eq .",
    "we remark that the supranova ( @xcite ) provides the most appealing scenario , because of the large amount of iron material ejected by the supernova explosion preceding the burst .",
    "in fact , theoretical computations of the explosion of massive stars indicate that @xmath63 of iron are ejected by the sn ( @xcite ) . in the case of sn1987a ,",
    "whose progenitor had @xmath64 , a similar amount of iron was derived from optical observations ( @xcite ) .    in future ,",
    "it is conceivable that simultaneous observations of the ly@xmath10 line may help to determine @xmath27 , and thus uniquely determine the total illuminated mass , and by implication the adequacy of different formation scenarios .",
    "in this paper we have obtained the following results :    * we have searched the x  ray spectrum of gb970508 s afterglow for an iron line , located at the system s redhift ( z = 0.835 ) ; we found such a line with limited statistical significance ( @xmath65 ) in the early part ( first @xmath66 ) of the afterglow ; the line decreases in the later part of the observations ( @xmath67 day after the burst ) by at least a factor 2 , enough to make it undetectable with current apparatus ; * simultaneously with the line disappearance , the x  ray flux both rises and hardens ( @xmath68 , while @xmath69 before the reburst ) , consistent with the appearance of a new shock .",
    "then , at the end of the outburst , the spectrum steepens .",
    "we showed that these observations indicate that a mass @xmath70 should be located at a distance of @xmath71 and sideways with respect to the observer , and is moving at subrelativistic speed . in order to reach such distance ,",
    "this material must have been pre  ejected by the source originating the burst , shortly ( perhaps a year , for typical sn expansion speeds ) before the burst .",
    "we stress that these observations contain two coincidences : on the one hand , this is the only burst in which a reburst and a line have been observed by bepposax ; on the other , the iron line disappears exactly at the moment of the reburst .",
    "we also point out that a line feature , with a similar significance , has been found by asca in another burst , grb970828 , which also shows an event of rebursting during the x - ray afterglow ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thank the referee , dr .",
    "m. boettcher , for his critical suggestions that improved the paper substantially , f. matteucci for helpful discussions and the bepposax team for the support with observations .",
