    "<S> unitary control and decoherence appear to be irreconcilable in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> when a quantum system interacts with an environment , control strategies usually fail due to decoherence . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we implement a time - optimal unitary control protocol suitable for quantum open systems . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on succesive diabatic and sudden switch transitions in the avoided crossings of the energy spectra of closed systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the speed of this control protocol meets the fundamental bounds imposed by the quantum speed limit , thus making this scheme ideal for application where decoherence needs to be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this method can achieve complex control strategies with high accuracy in quantum open systems .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _ - quantum control is a fundamental goal in different areas , including physical chemistry , nanoscience and quantum information processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as the manipulation of quantum systems will be the basis for future technological applications , the development of different control strategies is a task of major interest nowadays .    </S>",
    "<S> an unitary control scheme consists of engineering the time dependence of one or several external parameters ( i.e. electric fields ) which manipulate the temporal evolution of a quantum system in order to obtain a desired target state . </S>",
    "<S> but , real systems interact with their environment to a greater or lesser extent . </S>",
    "<S> no matter how weak the coupling between the system and the environment is , the evolution of an open system will be characterised by nonunitary effects like decoherence and dissipation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence , in particular , is a quantum effect whereby the system loses its ability to exhibit coherent behavior . </S>",
    "<S> it is a serious obstacle in quantum information processing in general , and in quantum control in particular @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> control faces major difficulties when dealing with open systems , as the control field can not fully compensate the dissipative and decohering effects from the environment . facing this threat requires a control protocol not only to assure high fidelity but also to be implemented in a time span shorter than the decoherence time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , quantum mechanics imposes fundamental limits on the maximum rapidity with which a state can evolve to an orthogonal state . </S>",
    "<S> known as the quantum speed limit ( qsl ) , it is a physical bound that any control strategy should take into account @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we implement an efficient method for controlling a quantum system in contact with an environment . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the knowledge of the spectrum of the closed system as a function of a suitable external parameter and requires that the system behaves locally -near avoided crossings- as the landau - zener ( lz ) two level model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this characteristic may seem rather restrictive , it is , in fact , a general property of systems with interaction between its energy levels @xcite , at least in the low energy region . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a well  defined series of fast ( diabatic ) and sudden ( step  like ) variations of the control parameter , which allows us to travel through the state space of the system and reach the desired target state . </S>",
    "<S> the speed of this control protocol meets the fundamental bounds imposed by the qsl , thus making this scheme ideal for application to open systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this method is very successful to accomplish ambitious control goals in systems exposed to an important environmental decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , this method avoids the need of using optimization algorithms in order to find a time  optimal control function , and thus various potentially encumbered subjects such as monotonicity , convergence and performance of the algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> _ control strategy and qsl _ - the building block of this strategy is the lz model for a quantum system with two interacting levels . in the diabatic basis @xmath0 the hamiltonian of this system can be written @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant and we set @xmath3 along the letter . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of @xmath4 form an hyperbola in the @xmath5 plane ( as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( a ) ) , whose vertex represents an avoided crossing ( ac ) with an energy gap @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian form the so - called adiabatic basis , @xmath6 , where the notation makes explicit the asymptotic correspondence between both basis when @xmath7 . when @xmath8 , this correspondence is exchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the classic lz theory describes the transition probability of the system when the initial state is @xmath9 and the parameter @xmath10 is sweept linearly in time , i.e. @xmath11 , yielding the famous lz formula @xmath12 this result defines a critical velocity @xmath13 which determines two limiting control scenarios . in the first place </S>",
    "<S> , we have the fast _ diabatic _ ( d ) transitions , in which @xmath14 in such a way that @xmath15 , leaving the initial state unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the _ adiabatic _ ( a ) transitions , in which @xmath16 and thus @xmath17 , take place when the state evolves slowly following the adiabatic curve and finishes in state @xmath18 . for a closed quantum system in which the transitions between neighbouring levels are well described by the lz model </S>",
    "<S> , this scheme provides a quantitative binary ( a - d ) recipe for determining the appropiate velocity of the driving field at each of the avoided crossings ( acs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the presence of an environment , decoherence is bound to act within the long periods of time required by adiabatic transitions , rendering the effective dynamics of the system non  unitary and thus preventing the system from being controlled .    to overcome this problem </S>",
    "<S> we propose an alternative method in which we use the so - called sudden - switch transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider the lz system prepared initially in the state @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we now consider @xmath20 to be a piecewise constant function with initial value @xmath21 , with @xmath22 @xcite . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the initial state is approximately an instantaneous eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> if now @xmath20 undertakes a sudden variation to @xmath24 and the system is left to evolve for a time t , the final state is given by @xmath25 it is clear that choosing @xmath26 yields @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the final step in the evolution is a second sudden switch of the control parameter from 0 to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> once again , the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian will be approximately those of @xmath29 , in such a way that @xmath30 will be a stationary state for @xmath31 , since @xmath27 . in sum </S>",
    "<S> , we have driven the system from @xmath32 to @xmath18 in a time @xmath26 with a probability of 1 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , this scheme represents a sort of _ shortcut _ to adiabaticity , as the final state of the system is the same as if the parameter @xmath20 had been modified adiabatically . </S>",
    "<S> the total evolution time has been dramatically shortened , since an adiabatic passage through the ac requires a total time much larger than a critical time of the order of @xmath33 ( recall the critical velocity expression from the lz formula ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the total evolution time @xmath34 is precisely the shortest possible time in which this two level system can change its state , as a consequence of the time - energy uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as follows . </S>",
    "<S> bhattacharyya @xcite derived from the mandelstam - tamm inequality @xcite the expression @xmath35 , in which @xmath36 is the quantum non - decay probability , i.e. , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> in the context of control theory , @xmath39 can be chosen as the total time of the control protocol ( for the two level system ) , in such a way that @xmath40 . evaluating this result for the hamiltonian ( [ ec : hlz ] ) , with @xmath19 and @xmath41 we get the minimum possible @xmath39 to be @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 can be calculated straightforwardly recalling from ( [ ec : hlz ] ) that @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields the result @xmath45 , i.e. , exactly the total evolution time of the sudden - switch transition , which makes it the best possible candidate for replacing slow adiabatic driving at an avoided crossing , as its time - optimality favors the prospect of avoiding decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> +     ]    _ controlling the dissipative lz model _ - we now show how our control method gives satisfactory results when applied to the lz hamiltonian coupled to a bosonic environment . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a master equation approach in the weak coupling and high temperature limit , which becomes independent of the particular election of time dependence of the control parameter . </S>",
    "<S> assuming bilinear coupling of the form @xmath46 ( the @xmath47 s being the position operators of the environmental oscillators ) , the master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath48 results @xcite    @xmath49}\\right ] } \\\\   & + i\\frac{\\gamma_0\\delta}{4}\\:\\left(\\sigma_y\\rho(t)\\sigma_z-\\sigma_z\\rho(t)\\sigma_y\\right ) , \\end{split } \\label{ec : ecmaestra}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the ( dimensionless ) coupling constant between the system and the environment at equilibrium temperature @xmath34 ( we set the boltzman constant @xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 is the renormalized non - hermitian effective hamiltonian of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this differential equation describes the non - unitary evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath48 of the system which , in the small coupling limit , will be mainly due to the double - commutator term . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to study how this non - unitary dynamic affects the fidelity of the control scheme , defined in this context as @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite by different analytical approaches that while diabatic ( @xmath54 ) transitions in a dissipative lz do not seem to suffer decoherence and thus achieve high fidelity , adiabatic ( @xmath55 ) variations of the control parameter render poor final state fidelity even for weak coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] inset ( b ) , where the fidelity as a function of time is plotted for different values of @xmath50 . as @xmath20 , being sweept slowly , reaches the ac , the system becomes extremely sensitive to decoherence and rapidly becomes mixed . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity then fails to achieve the desired value of 1 . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently large @xmath50 , the state losses its purity and evolves to @xmath56 , for which @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the desired transition to @xmath55 is indeed achieved with high probability if the system is driven by the sudden switch method . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] we show how the fidelity in this case evolves favorably even in the presence of the environment , making this method much more robust under the action of external influences , due to its time - optimality . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the difference in the total evolution time between both methods is remarkable , as the adiabatic driving takes up to three orders of magnitude more time than the sudden - switch method . in sum , this represents a time - optimal , relatively decoherence - resistant control recipe for achieving `` adiabatic '' ( @xmath58 ) transitions at an ac in the energy spectrum of a system . together with the diabatic transitions , this updated binary control protocol ( which we will refer to as s - d ) renders a shorter control time and high fidelity at each ac , even in the presence of a dissipative environment . </S>",
    "<S> +     ]    _ controlling a dissipative multilevel system _ - we will show now how to apply our control method to a more complex multilevel system . </S>",
    "<S> consider two interacting spin@xmath59 particles @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with dynamics given by the hamiltonian @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the i  th pauli operator in hilbert space associated to particle @xmath64 and all energy parameters are fixed but @xmath65 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] we show the energy spectrum associated to hamiltonian ( [ ec : h4niveles ] ) as a function of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum resemble the one corresponding to realizable systems like a qubit in a cavity or a josephson junction qubit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is found to have four acs where the levels interact ; two of them are located at @xmath24 while the other two are placed symmetrically at @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the parameter @xmath67 , in such a way that two of the acs have a gap @xmath2 and the remaining two have a wider gap of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence between the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath69 and the diabatic basis @xmath70 has been made explicit in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> since we are specially interested in studying how the fidelity of the method evolves in the presence of decoherence , we once again consider a thermal bosonic environment coupled to the subsystem @xmath60 bilinearly as @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the master equation for the reduced density matrix of the composite system , in the small coupling and high temperature limit , turns to be identical in form to ( [ ec : ecmaestra ] ) , where @xmath29 and @xmath2 are to be replaced with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now pose the problem of starting from an initial state @xmath74 and driving the system to @xmath75 . for that purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we design a path in the energy spectrum , which can be seen in fig . [ fig : fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this path requires the control parameter to be sweept following the sequence d - s - d - s ( where d stands for a diabatic transition and s for sudden - switch transition ) in order to achieve the desired navigation of the spectrum . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] we show the time dependence chosen for @xmath20 in order to achieve this evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the high  slope linear segments correspond to diabatic transitions , and two of the the constant segments have a lenght @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , as required by the sudden - switch method .     ]     ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ( b ) we show the evolution of the probabilities of finding the system in each of the various diabatic states , when the driving field of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) is applied to the closed system ( @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity in this case is @xmath79 , i.e. , the black curve in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> there , it can be seen how the state remains unchanged , as expected , after the first diabatic passage . </S>",
    "<S> then , as the control parameter undertakes the first sudden - switch , the state evolves to @xmath80 in a time @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> next , two sucesive diabatic transitions take place when the control parameter is sweept linearly with high speed , after which the state of the system is still @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a second sudden switch evolves the system from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , now in a time @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> each step of the protocol is successful , yielding an elevated final fidelity of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the total time of evolution has barely added up to @xmath83 , which represents an excellent time performance . </S>",
    "<S> the results of applying the same control protocol to the system coupled to the environment ( @xmath84 ) are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ( c ) . in this case , the non - unitary fashion of the evolution manifests itself through the decay of the purity of the state in time , although the rapidness of the control protocol allows it to act in a time interval shorter than the decoherence time , making the system follow the desired path and consequently achieving a fairly high fidelity . moreover , as most of the total evolution time is due to the sudden - switch transitions , which are time - optimal , its bound to expect that there is no room for improving the final state fidelity with this or any other kind of unitary control . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] we show how the final fidelity @xmath85 varies as the coupling with the environment is increased . there </S>",
    "<S> it can be appreciated how the s - d method yields a fidelity of over 0.8 for @xmath86 , and becomes unsuccessful for sufficiently large @xmath50 , as can be expected due to the presence of an strongly decohering environment . for comparative purposes , </S>",
    "<S> a similar plot is shown with the results obtained applying the previous a - d method to the four  level system , where we can see that the old method fails even for small coupling . </S>",
    "<S> + _ final remarks _ - we have implemented an efficient method to control the state of a quantum open system . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the navigation in the energy spectrum of the closed system , using fast variations of a control parameter ( which are already familiar schemes used in nmr , quantum optics , and cavity and circuit qed , for engineering quantum dynamics ) . </S>",
    "<S> the success of this method to overcome the adverse influence of decoherence relies in the speed in which the transitions are performed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the sudden transitions occur in the quantum speed limit . </S>",
    "<S> the method was succesfully applied in a system with four energy levels to reach desired target states that lie far in the spectrum from the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our proposed control function has a simple analytical form even for complex multilevel systems , as opposed to those obtained through optimization methods ( see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact makes our method very attractive for future experimental applications where several of the requirements of the method are fulfilled , but decoherence appears as an obstacle for the quantum control . </S>"
