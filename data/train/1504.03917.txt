    "the discrimination between a finite number of quantum states , prepared with given prior probabilities , is essential for many tasks in quantum information and quantum cryptography .",
    "since nonorthogonal states can not be distinguished perfectly , discrimination strategies have been developed which are optimal with respect to various figures of merit . based on the outcome of a measurement , in these strategies",
    "a guess is made about the actual state of the quantum system .",
    "several strategies admit a certain probability , or rate , @xmath2 , of inconclusive results , where the measurement outcomes do not allow to infer the state .    in the strategy of minimum - error discrimination @xcite inconclusive results",
    "are not permitted , and the overall probability @xmath3 of making a wrong guess is minimized with @xmath4 , which corresponds to maximizing the overall probability @xmath5 of getting a correct result .",
    "apart from studying some general features of the optimal measurement @xcite , in the beginning mainly the minimum - error discrimination of states obeying certain symmetry properties or of two mixed states was investigated , see e. g. @xcite .",
    "the minimum - error discrimination of more than two states that are arbitrary has gained renewed interest only recently @xcite .",
    "generalizing the concept of minimum - error discrimination , an optimal discrimination strategy has been studied which maximizes the total rate of correct results , @xmath5 , with a fixed rate @xmath2 of inconclusive results @xcite .",
    "this strategy also maximizes the relative rate @xmath6 for the fixed value @xmath2 , that is it yields the maximum achievable fraction of correct results referred to all conclusive results , which in most cases is larger for @xmath7 than for @xmath8 necessary and sufficient operator conditions for the optimal measurement have been derived @xcite , and it was shown @xcite that under certain conditions the strategy for maximizing @xmath5 with a fixed rate @xmath2 contains the optimal strategies for unambiguous discrimination @xcite or for discrimination with maximum confidence @xcite as limiting cases for sufficiently large values of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it was found @xcite that when the maximum of @xmath5 is known as a function of the fixed value @xmath2 , then from this function one can also obtain the maximum of @xmath5 in another optimal discrimination strategy where the error probability is fixed @xcite .",
    "optimal discrimination with a fixed rate @xmath2 has been also investigated for a modified optimization problem where in contrast to the usual assumption the prior probabilities of the states are unknown @xcite .",
    "solutions for optimal state discrimination with a fixed rate @xmath2 of inconclusive results and with given prior probabilities of the states have been recently derived in three independent papers : starting from the operator equations for the optimality conditions , in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtained analytical solutions for the discrimination of symmetric states and of two states occurring with arbitrary prior probabilities , where the two states are either pure or belong to a certain class of mixed qubit states . in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite the respective authors showed that the optimization problem with fixed @xmath2 can be solved by reducing it to a resulting minimum - error problem the solution of which is known and to an additional optimization .",
    "they derived analytical solutions for discriminating between two pure states occurring with arbitrary prior probabilities and between the trine states @xcite , and also for the discrimination of geometrically uniform states @xcite .",
    "the present paper goes beyond these previous investigations in several respects .",
    "based on the ideas of our earlier work @xcite we study general properties of the optimal measurement for discriminating with fixed @xmath2 between @xmath0 arbitrary qudit states in a @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "specializing on the case @xmath9 , we develop a method for treating the optimal discrimination with fixed @xmath2 between @xmath0 arbitrary qubit states , occurring with arbitrary prior probabilities .",
    "in contrast to the previous papers @xcite we take into account that often the optimal measurement is not unique , which means that the maximal probability of correct results with fixed @xmath2 can be obtained by a number of different measurements . in the special case @xmath4 , where the problem corresponds to minimum - error discrimination , our method differs from the approaches developed previously for treating the minimum - error discrimination of @xmath0 arbitrary qubit states @xcite .",
    "we obtain explicit analytical results for several problems that have not been solved before , mostly for the discrimination with fixed @xmath2 between qubit states which posses a certain partial symmetry , but also for discriminating @xmath0 equiprobable qubit states and for the discrimination between a pure state and a uniformly mixed state in a @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space .",
