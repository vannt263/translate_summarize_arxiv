    "quantum key distribution protocols allow two users , alice ( @xmath0 ) and bob ( @xmath1 ) , to establish a shared secret key secure against an all - powerful adversary eve ( @xmath2 ) who is bounded only by the laws of physics - an end unattainable through classical means alone .",
    "several such protocols have been developed since the original bb84 @xcite ( the reader is referred to @xcite for a general survey ) and many of them include rigorous proofs of unconditional security .",
    "such a proof of security generally involves determining a bound on the protocol s key - rate ( to be defined shortly , though roughly speaking , it is the ratio of secret key bits to qubits sent ) as a function of the observed noise in the quantum channel .    in this paper , we consider several qkd protocols , and derive key - rate expressions based on multiple channel statistics .",
    "furthermore , our key - rate bounds will utilize statistics from mismatched measurements ; that is to say , those measurement outcomes where a and b s choice of bases are incompatible - events which are typically discarded by the protocol specification ( there are exceptions as we mention next section ) .",
    "in fact , by using these mismatched measurement results , the key - rate bounds we derive demonstrate that many of the protocols we consider here can actually tolerate higher levels of noise than previously thought .",
    "thus , the primary contributions of this paper are two - fold .",
    "first , we derive a general approach to deriving key - rate expressions , in the asymptotic scenario , for a wide - range of discrete variable qkd protocol utilizing all possible channel statistics , including mismatched measurement results .",
    "secondly , by applying this technique to several , very different protocols ( including a limited - resource bb84 @xcite , an extended b92 @xcite , and a two - way semi - quantum protocol @xcite ) , we not only derive new key - rate expressions applicable to arbitrary , possibly asymmetric quantum channels , but , in many cases , our new bounds are substantial improvements over previous work with these protocols . along the way , we will also use our method to investigate optimal qkd protocols for asymmetric channels .",
    "we are not the first to consider the use of mismatched measurement outcomes for quantum key distribution . indeed , in the 1990 s barnett et al .",
    "@xcite showed that mismatched measurement results may be used to better detect an eavesdropper using an intercept - and - resend attack .    in @xcite ,",
    "mismatched measurement bases were applied to the four - state and six - state bb84 protocols @xcite .",
    "this method was shown to improve the key rate ( as determined by the devetak - winter equation in @xcite ) for certain quantum channels , namely the amplitude damping channel and rotation channel . in @xcite ,",
    "mismatched measurement results were actually used to distill a raw key ( as opposed to being used only for channel tomography ) - a modified bb84 protocol was adopted and this method was shown to improve the key rate for certain channels .    in @xcite , a modified four - state , two - basis bb84 was used where the first basis was the standard computational @xmath3 basis ( @xmath4 ) , while the second consisted of states @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the authors of that work showed that for small @xmath8 , mismatched measurement bases can still be used to gain good channel estimates while also allowing @xmath0 and @xmath1 to use mismatched measurement bases to distill their key ( since , for @xmath8 small , even with differing bases , their measurement results will be nearly correlated ) .",
    "mismatched measurements were used in @xcite in order to get better channel statistics for a single - state semi - quantum protocol first introduced in @xcite .",
    "though single - state semi - quantum protocols utilize two - way quantum channels , they admit many simplifications which ease their security analysis . in this paper",
    ", we consider a multi - state semi - quantum protocol ( which are more difficult to analyze ) and show mismatched measurements improve its key - rate .    in @xcite ,",
    "it was proven , using mismatched measurement bases , that the three - state bb84 protocol from @xcite has a key rate equal to that of the full four state bb84 protocol assuming a symmetric attack .",
    "also a four - state protocol using three bases has a key rate equal to that of the full six - state bb84 protocol . in this paper",
    ", we will arrive at the same conclusion , though using a more information theoretic argument .",
    "however , we will also analyze other protocols , adapt our approach to two - way quantum channels , consider an optimized qkd protocol , and , for all considered protocols , derive new key - rate expressions suitable for asymmetric channels .",
    "our method , building off of our conference paper in @xcite ( where we only considered a three - state bb84 protocol ) , is very general and applicable to multiple qkd protocols , both one - way and , as we will demonstrate , two - way ( those which utilize a two - way quantum channel allowing a qubit to travel from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , then return to @xmath0 thus passing through the adversary twice ) . after an introduction to our notation",
    ", we will first explain the parameter estimation method and our technique",
    ". we will then apply it to variants of the bb84 protocol , confirming the results of @xcite mentioned above ( though also deriving key - rate expressions for arbitrary channels ) .",
    "we will consider the extended b92 protocol @xcite and derive an improved key - rate bound for it .",
    "we will then use our method to consider an `` optimal '' qkd protocol .",
    "finally , we will analyze a multi - state semi - quantum protocol from @xcite which relies on a two - way quantum channel .",
    "this new proof of security will derive a more optimistic bound on the key rate expression than the one previously constructed in @xcite ( the latter did not use mismatched measurement bases ) .",
    "we now introduce some notation we will use . let @xmath9 be the shannon entropy function , namely : @xmath10 where all logarithms in this paper are base two unless otherwise specified .",
    "we will occasionally use the notation @xmath11 to mean @xmath12 .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the binary shannon entropy function , namely : @xmath14 .",
    "we write @xmath15 to mean the von neumann entropy of the density operator @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath16 is finite dimensional ( and all systems in this paper are finite dimensional ) , then let @xmath17 be its eigenvalues . in this case @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath16 acts on a bipartite hilbert space @xmath19 we will often write @xmath20 . when we write @xmath21 we mean the result of tracing out @xmath1 s portion of @xmath20 ( that is , @xmath22 ) . similarly for @xmath23 and for systems with three or more subspaces .",
    "given density operator @xmath20 we will write @xmath24 to mean @xmath25 and @xmath26 to mean @xmath27 . we denote by @xmath28 to be the conditional von neumman entropy defined as @xmath29 .",
    "if the context is clear , we will forgo writing the `` @xmath16 '' subscript .",
    "when we talk about qubits , we will often refer to the @xmath3 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 bases , the states of which we denote : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where : @xmath35",
    "we will now describe the parameter estimation method and what may be gleaned from it .",
    "this extends the preliminary work we did in our conference paper @xcite where we only considered three states from two bases .",

    "without loss of generality , we may describe @xmath36 s action on states of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is some arbitrary , normalized state in @xmath41 , as follows : @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are states in @xmath41 which are not necessarily normalized nor orthogonal .",
    "unitarity of @xmath36 imposes certain obvious restrictions on these states which will become important momentarily .",

    "the @xmath3 and @xmath30 bases are customarily used in the bb84 protocol , while the @xmath3 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 bases are used in the six - state bb84 protocol @xcite .",

    "let @xmath63 be fixed and public knowledge .",
    "let @xmath64 also be fixed and public knowledge . finally fix an attack operator @xmath36 known only to @xmath2 .",
    "repeat the following procedure for @xmath65 :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 chooses a random state @xmath66 and sends a qubit prepared in this state to @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath2 captures the qubit before it arrives at @xmath1 s lab and probes it using her attack operator @xmath36 .",
    "we assume this operator acts on the qubit and a freshly prepared ancilla @xmath41 prepared in a state @xmath43 known only to @xmath2 , but constant each iteration .",
    "that is , the system evolves from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "the qubit ( in @xmath40 ) is sent to @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   @xmath1 chooses a basis @xmath3 , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 ( assuming a state from one of these bases appears in @xmath69 ) and measures the qubit in that basis .",
    "4 .   @xmath0 and @xmath1 disclose their choice of basis .",
    "@xmath0 discloses the state she prepared and @xmath1 discloses his measurement result .",
    "this communication is done via an authenticated classical channel .",
    "note that they do not discard any measurement results ( i.e. , they do not discard iterations where they chose different bases ) .",
    "we will consider two cases for the choice of @xmath69 in this paper ( others may easily follow from our computations ) : @xmath70 that is , in the first case , @xmath0 is limited to only sending three possible states from the four available in the @xmath3 and @xmath71 bases ; in the second she can only send four possible states from the six available in the @xmath3 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 bases .",
    "note that , on step 3 of the parameter estimation protocol above , @xmath1 will measure in either the @xmath3 or @xmath71 bases in the first case ; in the second case he will measure in the @xmath3 , @xmath71 , or @xmath72 bases ( his outcomes could be any of the four states or six states respectively ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can , for instance , estimate the probability of @xmath36 flipping a @xmath73 to a @xmath74 but they can not directly observe the probability of @xmath36 flipping a @xmath74 to a @xmath73 ( as @xmath0 can never prepare the state @xmath74 ) .",
    "note that in this paper , we assume @xmath75 may be set large enough so as to attain arbitrarily high levels of accuracy in all estimates .",
    "this is clearly without loss of generality in the asymptotic scenario in qkd security ; it remains an open question to analyze this scenario in the finite key setting where imprecision will affect the final key rate computation .",
    "clearly @xmath0 and @xmath1 may estimate @xmath76 by using those iterations where @xmath77 and @xmath1 measures in the @xmath3 bases .",
    "now , denote by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 , to be the probability that @xmath1 measures @xmath81 if @xmath0 initially sends @xmath82 in step 1 of the protocol , conditioning on the event both parties choose the correct basis for such an outcome .",
    "also , let @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the real part of @xmath85 and the imaginary part of @xmath85 respectively .",
    "now , consider @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath0 sends @xmath87 , after evolution by @xmath36 , the state becomes : @xmath88 from which it is clear that @xmath89 .",
    "similarly , the following expressions are easily derived :    @xmath90    @xmath91    as already mentioned , if @xmath92 , then each @xmath93 can be estimated by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . if @xmath94 , then @xmath95 and @xmath96 are statistics that are observable by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . if @xmath97 , then this provides @xmath0 and @xmath1 with estimates of the quantities @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath36 is unitary and so @xmath101 , this also provides @xmath0 and @xmath1 with an estimate of @xmath102 ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) . finally ,",
    "using these , along with the cauchy - schwarz inequality to bound @xmath104 ( both @xmath105 and @xmath106 should be small as they represent the @xmath3 basis error rate ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 may bound @xmath107 using @xmath96 .",
    "we will show a particular example shortly when we consider a symmetric attack .",
    "if @xmath108 , then @xmath0 and @xmath1 may estimate all of the above , in addition to @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "this , combined with the above , allows @xmath0 and @xmath1 to estimate : @xmath111 ( i.e. , they may estimate both the real parts - using @xmath71 - and the imaginary parts - using @xmath72 ) .",
    "finally , the quantity @xmath110 , together with @xmath96 may be used to compute a better estimate of @xmath112 and @xmath107 . to illustrate ,",
    "assume @xmath56 ( other values may be used , though the algebra becomes tedious ) .",
    "then , the following identities are easy to derive : @xmath113 ( note , in the above , we made use of the fact that @xmath114 and @xmath115 due to unitarity of @xmath36 . )      the above analysis applies to any arbitrary channel . however , to illustrate the use of the above expressions , let us consider a special case that @xmath2 s attack operator @xmath36 is symmetric ; in particular , @xmath2 s attack is such that its action on @xmath40 may be modeled as a depolarization channel with parameter @xmath116 .",
    "that is , for any two - dimensional density operator @xmath16 , we have , after @xmath2 s attack : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the two - dimensional identity operator .",
    "this assumption is common in the qkd literature .",
    "however , we comment that , in the following , we will only utilize statistics that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are capable of observing directly ; our use of a depolarization channel is simply to demonstrate our technique and to put concrete numbers to these many parameters .",
    "furthermore , since only observable statistics are used , this depolarization channel assumption is entirely enforceable by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath119 ( the same set that was considered in our conference paper @xcite ) , with @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath0 sends a @xmath3 state @xmath82 for @xmath121 , then the qubit s state when it arrives at @xmath1 s lab is : @xmath122 from this",
    ", it is clear that @xmath123 .",
    "thus @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "now , if @xmath0 sends @xmath87 , it is clear that @xmath126 . from this , along with equation [ eq : p0a ] , we conclude @xmath127 .",
    "( the reader will observe that , when @xmath128 , and so @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 as expected . ) similarly , we conclude that @xmath131 .",
    "substituting this into equation [ eq : paa ] , and solving for @xmath107 , we find : @xmath132 where we used the fact that @xmath133 and so @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135 ( which it would be in this depolarization channel scenario ) , then the above simplifies to : @xmath136 an expression with no dependence on @xmath49 ( other than @xmath137 ) . by the cauchy - schwarz inequality",
    ", we have @xmath138 $ ] thus implying @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "now , if @xmath108 , for @xmath140 , then , in addition to the above , we also find @xmath141 ( using a similar method as described above , but with statistics @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 ) . by realizing that @xmath145",
    ", we also have @xmath146 .",
    "thus , in this setting , it holds that @xmath147 .",
    "clearly , @xmath49 and @xmath50 do not appear in the symmetric case ; let us now consider the choice of these parameters for arbitrary channels . denote by @xmath83 to be , as before , @xmath148 ( similarly @xmath84 ) .",
    "this is the actual value of the inner product of these two states .",
    "denote by @xmath149 and @xmath150 to be @xmath0 and @xmath1 s estimate of these quantities after parameter estimation .",
    "we now determine how the choice of @xmath49 and @xmath50 affect these estimates , assuming we have perfect parameter estimation of the required @xmath78 quantities ( in the asymptotic scenario , which we focus on in this paper , this is not a problem ; we leave the non - perfect case as future study )",
    ".    clearly , from equations [ eq : p0a ] , [ eq : p1a ] , and [ eq : pa0 ] , we have @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 . from equations",
    "[ eq : p0b ] , [ eq : p1b ] , and [ eq : pb0 ] , we get the same result for the imaginary parts of these quantities .",
    "the choice of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , therefore , do not affect these estimates .",
    "what remains is to consider how these two parameters affect @xmath155 and @xmath156 . using equation",
    "[ eq : paa ] , @xmath0 and @xmath1 will estimate these two quantities using the identity : @xmath157    using the fact that the estimates for all real parts on the right - hand side of the above expression are , indeed , the actual values , the above implies ( substituting in @xmath158 for the actual values @xmath83 ) : @xmath159 from which we see there is no dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "of course this parameter may affect the key rate for certain protocols ( as we see later ) , it does not affect the parameter estimation process assuming perfect estimates of @xmath78 .",
    "when we consider also the @xmath72 basis , we additionally get the following identity ( using @xmath110 ) : @xmath160    combining this with the above , we find @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "thus , in this case , we get exact estimates of the actual values of @xmath2 s attack which , again , do not depend on @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "the above all assumed perfect accuracy in our estimation of the quantities @xmath78 . in a realistic scenario , this will not be the case . in such a setting , the choice of @xmath49 and @xmath50 will no doubt alter the estimation of the quantities @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we leave this study as future work .",
    "in this section , we will apply the above estimation method to analyze four different qkd protocols .",
    "first , a generalized bb84-style protocol with only three or four states being sent .",
    "secondly , we will analyze the extended b92 protocol first introduced in @xcite .",
    "after this , we will consider an `` optimized '' qkd protocol .",
    "finally , we will apply our technique to a protocol relying on a two - way quantum channel ( thus allowing the attacker two opportunities to interact with the qubit each iteration ) .",
    "for all these protocols , we will derive key - rate expressions as functions of the various @xmath83 quantities discussed in the last section from which protocol [ alg : pe ] may be used to discover bounds on .",
    "a qkd protocol operates by first performing several iterations of a _ quantum communication stage _ , the result of which is an @xmath163-bit _ raw key _ : a bit - string that is partially secret and partially correlated ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 each have their own version of the raw key ) . following this , assuming @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not abort",
    ", they perform an error correction protocol and a privacy amplification protocol ( see @xcite ) , resulting in a secret key of size @xmath164-bits ( possibly @xmath165 if the noise rate is too high - i.e. , if @xmath2 has potentially too much information on the raw key ) .",
    "the goal is to determine @xmath164 as a function of the noise rate ( in our case , as functions of the various @xmath78 values considered in the previous section ) .",
    "actually , we are interested in computing a protocol s _ key rate _ in the _ asymptotic scenario _ , defined to be : @xmath166    we will first consider collective attacks : these are attacks where @xmath2 applies the same attack operation each iteration of the protocol .",
    "thus each iteration is independent of all others .",
    "later we will consider _ general attacks _ where no such restrictions are placed on the adversary .",
    "assuming collective attacks , it was shown in @xcite that the key rate is : @xmath167 where the infimum is over all collective attacks which induce the observed statistics .",

    "it is clear that this quantity is identical to equation [ eq : paa ] , replacing `` @xmath369 '' states with `` @xmath372 '' states .",
    "call this probability @xmath373 . using the above ,",
    "this becomes : @xmath374    now , let @xmath375 be the @xmath3 basis error rate when @xmath1 reflects ( i.e. , the @xmath3 basis error when a qubit travels forwards to @xmath1 , then backwards to @xmath0 , through the two - way channel ) .",
    "it is clear that this is a statistic which @xmath0 and @xmath1 may estimate .",
    "furthermore , @xmath376 .    substituting equation [ eq : sqkd : g03 ] into equation [ eq : qa ] and solving for @xmath366 yields : @xmath377 ( note that above we used the fact that @xmath134 . )    at this point , we already have enough to find reasonable estimates of @xmath359 .",
    "indeed , the cauchy - schwarz inequality enforces the condition that @xmath378 ( though if @xmath255 is used for parameter estimation , we get @xmath371 ) . also , using equation [ eq : prbounds ] and the cauchy - schwarz inequality we have : @xmath379 .",
    "the second scenario involves the two channels being correlated in that @xmath380 . for each channel scenario",
    ", we will consider two cases : @xmath94 and @xmath108 .    for the independent channel case ,",
    "when @xmath301 we see our key rate remains positive for all @xmath381 .",
    "when @xmath382 it remains positive for all @xmath383 .",
    "for the correlated channels , when @xmath301 the key rate remains positive for all @xmath384 .",
    "when @xmath382 it remains positive for all @xmath385 .",
    "these are improvements from the original bound from @xcite ( which did not use mismatched measurement outcomes ) .",
    "see table [ table : sqkd ] for a summary of this data .",
    "we have thus shown not only that our methods may be extended to two - way quantum channels , but also that this semi - quantum protocol can actually withstand a much higher level of noise than previously thought .",
    "improvements in the parameter estimation process for two - way channels may lead to even better bounds ( recall , we were forced to drop certain @xmath233 terms which could only have improved the result ) .",
    "r|cc & independent & correlated + old bound from @xcite & @xmath386 & @xmath387 +   + new bound using @xmath254 & @xmath388 & @xmath389 + new bound using @xmath255 & @xmath390 & @xmath391      in the previous sections , we considered only collective attacks .",
    "however , all protocols considered in this paper may be made permutation invariant in the usual way @xcite .",
    "thus , the results of @xcite apply : namely , proving security against collective attacks is sufficient to show security against arbitrary , general attacks . in the asymptotic scenario , which we considered here , the key - rate expressions will remain the same .",
    "we have shown , using information theoretic arguments , that the use of mismatched measurement results can be used to improve the key rate bounds and noise tolerances for various protocols , both one - way and two - way .",
    "we applied this technique to a general , limited - resource bb84 , an extended b92 , an optimized qkd protocol , and a semi - quantum protocol . for the bb84 protocol , we confirmed through alternative means , the results of @xcite : namely that three states is sufficient to obtain full bb84 security , while four states in three bases is enough to obtain the full six - state bb84 level of security .",
    "our new key - rate bounds for the extended b92 protocol show it has a higher tolerance to noise than previously thought .",
    "similarly we derived improved key - rate bounds for the semi - quantum protocol of boyer et al.@xcite in all cases , we did not require any symmetry assumptions ( we evaluated our key - rate bounds using a symmetric attack for illustrative and comparative purposes only ) .",
    "one might attempt to use this technique on other two - way protocols beyond the class of semi - quantum ones .",
    "we did consider this - however the primary advantage of many two - way , fully quantum protocols ( i.e. , not semi - quantum that we considered here ) is that there are no mismatched measurement basis choices .",
    "thus a modification to the protocols would be required - an improved key rate may be found in this case , but one must then ask what the resulting advantage would be to the modified protocol . we leave this as an open question .",
    "we also leave as future study improving our parameter estimation method for two - way protocols .",
    "when deriving the key - rate bound for the sqkd protocol , we were forced to drop several terms which could only have increased the noise tolerance of the protocol .      finally , and very importantly , would be to study the performance of this method in finite key settings and when imperfect parameter estimation occurs .",
    "all results in this paper assumed @xmath0 and @xmath1 could perform enough iterations so as to derive arbitrarily precise estimates of various statistics . in a practical",
    "setting , there will always be some error .",
    "taking this into account , and deriving key - rate expressions in the finite key setting is important future work .",
