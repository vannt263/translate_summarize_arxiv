    "solid @xmath0he is the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies@xcite since the discovery of non classical rotational inertia@xcite ( ncri ) , an expected manifestation of supersolidity.@xcite supersolidity is a new state of matter in which spatial order and off  diagonal long range order ( odlro ) are present at the same time , implying some form of superfluid properties , and was already predicted long ago.@xcite this novel state of matter attracts interest also in the prospect of finding it in cold atoms in optical lattices.@xcite however the precise nature of solid @xmath0he at low temperature is still elusive .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that defects play an important role in ncri , but which kind of disorder is responsible for the anomalous properties of solid @xmath0he is still not clear .",
    "many different defects have been considered , but none of the proposed models has shown to be able to capture all the phenomenology of supersolidity .",
    "for example the stiffening of @xmath0he below the `` transition '' temperature@xcite suggests dislocations as a candidate , but this possibility has difficulty in explaining the ncri seen in solid @xmath0he in vycor@xcite or in aerogel.@xcite grain boundaries have been considered too,@xcite but ncri has been observed also in single crystals.@xcite    defected solid @xmath0he systems have been studied by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques.@xcite such qmc methods are by construction equilibrium methods , so defects have to be stabilized by periodic boundary conditions ( via a suitable choice of the simulation box ) or by fixing the degrees of freedom of a number of atoms surrounding the interested defect . this constraint on the configurational space",
    "usually does not prevent the study of the physical properties of the defected system , and the results are generally in a good quantitative agreement with experimental observations ; see , for example , the estimation of the vacancy activation energy@xcite or the binding energy to the dislocation core of a @xmath4he atom.@xcite exact qmc results , both at finite@xcite and zero temperature@xcite , show that 2 and 3 vacancies form a bound state .",
    "a systematic study of many vacancies in solid @xmath0he is still lacking ; questions like whether the crystalline structure is stable in presence of a large number of vacancies , whether the vacancy ",
    "vacancy interaction is pairwise additive ( or almost so ) , whether many vacancies lead to phase separation as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , or whether vacancies turn themselves into other kinds of defects are , according to us , still unanswered .",
    "since the earliest days of supersolidity quantum lattice models have been considered.@xcite a terminology borrowed from lattice models is currently used for solid @xmath0he in terms of a commensurate state ( i.e. a perfect crystal in which there is an integer number of atoms per unit cell ) or an incommensurate one ( a crystal with non integer probability of occupation of the unit cell ) .",
    "qmc at @xmath5 k of solid @xmath0he with one or few vacancies in the simulation cell beautifully@xcite confirms the picture of an incommensurate state : the vacancy(-ies ) is ( are ) mobile and the number of density maxima is equal to the number of particles _ plus _ the number of vacancies . but are we sure that we understand vacancies at a finite concentration in a macroscopic system ? is the option commensurate or incommensurate really appropriate for solid @xmath0he ? one should keep in mind that in a lattice model or in cold atoms in an optical lattice the lattice periodicity is externally imposed , whereas in solid @xmath0he the same dynamical entities , the atoms , have to build up the periodicity as well as the delocalization required for supersolidity .",
    "such `` mermaid '' aspect of the atoms is unique to a quantum solid .",
    "the purpose of this article is to address such issues with exact qmc methods at @xmath5 k in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "we find that size and box commensuration effects are very pronounced , so in order to be able to explore very large distances in a monte carlo calculation , up to 100  , we have mainly studied solid @xmath0he in 2d . in this context , the 2d solid is also of interest as a simple model for out of registry solid @xmath0he adsorbed on planar substrates , such as graphite or silica glasses .",
    "new experimental investigations@xcite are under way to answer the question whether a supersolid state is present also in adsorbed @xmath0he .",
    "we have studied 2d solid @xmath0he systems at @xmath5 k with a number of atoms up and above thousand containing up to 30 vacancies .",
    "we find that crystalline order is stable also in presence of a large number of vacancies , at least in the range @xmath6% of vacancy concentration studied by us .",
    "multiple vacancies are highly correlated with a preference to form linear structures , but in presence of 10 or more vacancies the scars in the lattice are healed away transforming the vacancies mainly into dislocations .",
    "such dislocations are not permanent structures , but are mobile and their number is fluctuating .",
    "this allows exchange of particles across the system , not only in the cores of dislocations , giving the possibility of establishing a well defined , at least local , phase@xcite and indeed , in the simulated systems , we find a non decaying large distance tail in the one  body density matrix .",
    "this hints at the possibility that an extended system is supersolid but more work is needed to corroborate this conclusion .",
    "we do not address here the origin of vacancies / dislocations , i.e. if the true ground state of solid @xmath0he contains or not zero  point defects .",
    "our finding is that solid @xmath0he , at least in 2d , is much more complex than the picture derived from the notion of commensurate vs incommensurate state because the number of lattice sites is an ill defined quantity when dislocations are present .",
    "the number of lattice sites is a meaningful quantity , at least for the sizes we are able to simulate , only if the number of particles and the simulation box are such that the regular lattice exactly fits in or the misfit is limited to just one or very few vacancies .",
    "we have performed few simulations also in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "also in this case we find that , near melting , crystalline order is stable even in presence of 100 vacancies , but we have not yet performed a detailed characterization of the disorder in the system .    the paper is organized as follows : sec .  [",

    "we employ the exact @xmath5 k shadow path integral ground state ( spigs)@xcite method , an `` exact '' qmc technique.@xcite spigs is an extension of the path integral ground state ( pigs)@xcite method .",
    "the aim of pigs is to improve a variationally optimized trial wave function @xmath7 by constructing a path in the hilbert space of the system which connects the given @xmath7 to the lowest energy state of the system , @xmath8 , constrained by the choice of the number of particle @xmath9 , the geometry and the boundary conditions of the simulation box and the density @xmath10 . during this `` path '' ,",
    "the correct correlations among the particles arise through the `` imaginary time evolution operator '' @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian operator . for a large enough @xmath13 , an accurate representation for the lowest energy state wave function",
    "is given by @xmath14 , which can be written analytically by discretizing the path in imaginary time and exploiting the factorization property @xmath15 . in this way",
    ", @xmath16 turns out to be expressed in terms of convolution integrals which involve the `` imaginary time propagator '' @xmath17 for small @xmath18 , for which very accurate approximations can be found in literature.@xcite this maps the quantum system into a classical system of open polymers.@xcite an appealing feature peculiar to the pigs method is that , in @xmath16 , the variational ansatz acts only as a starting point , while the full path in imaginary time is governed by @xmath11 , which depends only on the hamiltonian operator .",
    "we have recently shown that pigs results for large enough @xmath13 are unaffected by the choice of @xmath7 both in the liquid and in the solid phase@xcite thus providing an unbiased exact @xmath5 k qmc method .",
    "within spigs a shadow wave function ( swf)@xcite is taken as @xmath7 and this choice was shown to greatly accelerate convergence to @xmath8 .",
    "another appealing feature of the spigs method is that it recovers the solid phase via a spontaneously broken translational symmetry@xcite and there is no constriction on the atomic positions , so it is particularly indicated in studying crystals with defects .",
    "by studying the equation of state we find the freezing and the melting densities to be , respectively , @xmath19 @xmath3 and @xmath20 @xmath3 . as simulation box",
    "we choose then a rectangular box fitting a regular triangular lattice with @xmath21 lattice sites at @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are applied in both directions .",
    "dealing with low temperature properties , @xmath0he atoms are described as structureless zero  spin bosons , interacting through the hfdhe2 aziz potential.@xcite in order to avoid any approximation associated with the estimation of tail corrections due to the finite size of the simulation boxes , we have considered a truncated and shifted aziz potential which goes to zero at @xmath22  . since @xmath23 is well below the minimum size of each considered box , the results relative to different box sizes can be compared without any further correction .",
    "our spigs computation is based on the pair ",
    "product approximation for the imaginary time projector@xcite and the imaginary time step @xmath24 k@xmath25 has been chosen in order to ensure a good accuracy and a reasonable computational effort.@xcite    an important parameter in the computation is the total projection time @xmath13 .",
    "any trial wave function @xmath7 can be expanded in terms of the exact ground state and of the excited states of zero total linear momentum .",
    "if we call @xmath26 the minimum excitation energy for such excited states , @xmath13 has to be larger than @xmath27 in order to project out any excitation contribution in @xmath7 ; the rate of rejection of such contributions depends also on the quantity one is computing due to sensitivity to missing long range correlations in @xmath7 or to wrong short range correlations . in the perfect crystal , using k as energy unit , @xmath28 k@xmath25 was found@xcite to be large enough to ensure convergence of both diagonal and off  diagonal observables when a swf is used as @xmath7 .",
    "this is compatible with the criterion @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , in a perfect crystal , the lowest energy excitations are phonons ; thus @xmath26 corresponds to the combination of two phonons of opposite @xmath30 with the smallest achievable @xmath31 value , i.e. in a box with pbc @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the largest side . via a new analytic continuation method@xcite",
    "we have estimated the longitudinal sound velocity for 2d solid @xmath0he at @xmath2@xmath3 to be @xmath34 k .",
    "then the minimum imaginary time requested for convergence is @xmath35 k@xmath25 in the largest simulation box considered here .",
    "this value is well below the used one @xmath28 k@xmath25 .",
    "since the transverse sound velocity is typically similar to @xmath36 , the considered @xmath13 value is enough to ensure also the removal of transverse phonon contribution .",
    "the situation might be different in presence of vacancies , or other kinds of defects , because novel low energy excitation modes could be present .",
    "we have performed several tests in order to be confident that also for defected crystals the considered value of @xmath13 is large enough .",
    "the most straightforward one is to perform simulations with larger @xmath13 values and verify that the expectation values are compatible within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "such a test turns out to be very time consuming and in practice it has been feasible only for a number of @xmath0he atom @xmath37 , where we have increased the value of @xmath13 up to @xmath38 k@xmath25 finding good convergence for diagonal properties",
    ". an indirect test on the convergence is provided by the behavior of suitably chosen observables during the imaginary time path .",

    "larger values of the imaginary time are needed to reach convergence for quantities that depend on long  range correlations , such as the static structure factor at small wave vectors ( @xmath58 ) .@xcite in the perfect crystal , convergence for @xmath58 is achieved at about @xmath59 k@xmath25 , as shown in fig.[f : lr ] . in the defected crystal ( especially when many vacancies are present as in the case considered in the figure ) the chosen @xmath28 k@xmath25 value is just enough to get convergence .",
    "an interesting physical effect emerges from fig.[f : lr ] , the static structure factor is strongly affected by the presence of defects especially along the nearest neighbor direction .",
    "two independent simulations are needed in order to calculate the formation energy of @xmath1 vacancies , one with @xmath60 particles ( the regular ideal crystal , dubbed also perfect crystal ) , and one with @xmath1 less atoms ( defected crystal ) . in this second case",
    "we say that we have @xmath61 vacancies , even if in general we can talk of vacancies only in the starting configuration of the simulation , where @xmath1 atoms are removed from the perfect lattice .",
    "in fact , in spigs , like in pimc , there is no constraint on the atomic positions , so that vacancies are free to transform into different kinds of defects . in presence of vacancies , after removing @xmath1 particles from the ideal starting configuration , we rescale the dimensions of the simulation box to reset the system to the original density .",
    "this is performed to circumvent the need of correcting the energy due to density changes caused by the inclusion of vacancies .",
    "the formation energy of @xmath1 vacancies is proportional to the difference@xcite between the energy per particle of the defected crystal , @xmath62 , and of the perfect one , @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64.\\ ] ] when vacancies turn into dislocations this @xmath65 has the meaning of defect formation energy at fixed density .",
    "one can consider also the formation energy @xmath66 at a fixed lattice parameter ; this is given by @xmath67 @xmath68 being the chemical potential , that for our system turns out to be @xmath69k .",
    "we check the presence of crystalline order by monitoring the static structure factor for the presence of bragg peaks . in addition , we compute the particle coordination number , via a delaunay triangulation@xcite ( dt ) of the sampled configurations , in order to estimate the amount of disorder in the system.@xcite in a perfectly ordered 2d triangular crystal each atom",
    "is linked to 6 other atoms in the dt .",
    "atoms with number of coordination not equal to 6 are then a measure of the disorder in the crystal.@xcite a conservation law exists for the coordination numbers:@xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of @xmath72coordinated atoms , so that we can consider only @xmath71 with @xmath73 . therefore we take @xmath74 as an estimate of disorder in the system ( we never found 3-sided polygons , i.e. @xmath75 ) . in a perfect ( @xmath60 ) 2d quantum crystal",
    "the coordination is 6 only on the average , in fact , due to the large zero point motion , fluctuations are present such that atoms do not have always coordination 6 .",
    "thus , a more useful quantity measuring the net amount of disorder in a crystal with defects is the difference between the observed @xmath76 and that of the corresponding perfect crystal : @xmath77    when the number of vacancies @xmath1 is small , up to 6 , we have also computed the vacancy  vacancy correlation function @xmath78 by recording the relative distances among vacancies during the monte carlo sampling .",
    "the determination of the vector positions of the vacancies in a crystalline configuration is far from being trivial due to the large zero point motion , to high vacancy mobility and because in our algorithm the center of mass is not fixed .",
    "vacancy positions are obtained via the coarse  graining procedure illustrated in ref .",
    "this method is efficient as long as we have few vacancies . for large @xmath1 the efficiency in recognizing",
    "the position of vacancies becomes extremely poor ( in fact , as we shall see , vacancies turn into dislocations ) , then is no more possible to compute @xmath78 .",
    "different definitions of vacancy positions , like the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , give very similar results.@xcite    a special care has been devoted in ruling out possible metastability effects .",
    "we have considered different starting configurations for vacancies , i.e. we have removed a number @xmath1 of atoms forming a compact cluster or a linear cluster , or the removed atoms come from random lattice positions .",
    "after long enough equilibration ( our simulations are never shorter than @xmath79 monte carlo steps ) we find agreeing results for systems with the same @xmath1 value . in order to rule out possible finite size effects and pbc bias",
    "we have considered systems of increasing sizes ( @xmath21 values ) .",
    "again we find compatible results for systems of different sizes and with equal @xmath1 value , so no appreciable finite size effects have been detected .",

    "furthermore we have considered also crystals with no principal crystalline axis parallel to the box sides obtaining once more the same results .",
    "moreover , we have considered systems where the starting configuration was obtained by removing @xmath1 particles from an equilibrated configuration of the perfect crystal and at the same time the positions of one ( two ) line(-s ) of atoms , parallel to one ( both ) box side(-s ) were kept fixed during the monte carlo sampling . even in this cases ,",

    "for @xmath89 the ratio @xmath90 remains practically constant with a value of about 0.61 k. this means that , when some vacancies are already present in the system , the creation of an additional vacancy has a very low cost , about one tenth of the cost of a single vacancy .",

    "[ f : vac3](b , c ) means that quantum dislocations are able also to induce vacancies in the surrounding crystal .",
    "contrarily to diagonal properties , in the computed one  body density matrix we find presence of significant size effects , as can be inferred for example by the significant difference between the @xmath110 in the @xmath115 , @xmath103 system and in the @xmath50 , @xmath52 one , in the intermediate distance range ( @xmath116 ) .",

    "another reason for studying larger systems is to establish how the number of dislocations scales with the size of the system and with the number of vacancies .",
    "presumably supersolidity and bec are present in a macroscopic system only if the concentration of dislocations is finite .",
    "in addition there is the question if the projection time @xmath13 is large enough to have convergence to the exact result . on the basis of indirect tests performed on diagonal observables which depend on long  range correlations ( see fig .",
    "[ f : lr ] ) we are rather confident that the used value of @xmath13 is large enough to get convergence , but we are not able to provide a direct test by using a larger value of @xmath13 again for computational limitations ( a computation with @xmath28k@xmath25 with @xmath24k@xmath25 and @xmath122 atoms has to handle about @xmath123 degrees of freedom ) . our results in the dislocation regime hint that odlro is present , but further tests are needed in order to firmly establishing this . in any case our results on off  diagonal properties in 2d systems enlighten a novel ability of dislocations in inducing exchanges even in their surroundings .",
    "in summary , we find that crystalline order in 2d @xmath0he is stable also in presence of a large number of vacancies and there is no tendency to phase separation .",
    "this is true also in 3d , we have studied up to 2548 particles and 98 vacancies and in all cases we find that crystalline order is present , as shown by the presence of bragg peaks in the static structure factor .",
    "when , in the 2d system , the number of vacancies is of order of 10 and above , vacancies inserted in the initial configuration loose their identity and most of them become quantum dislocations .",
    "such dislocations turn out to be very mobile and are able to induce exchange of particles across the system , which is necessary to supersolidity .",
    "the ability of dislocations to induce vacancies in the surrounding crystal could be relevant also for the 3d case .",
    "if this feature will be confirmed in 3d , the superfluidity would be not restricted to the dislocation cores,@xcite but exchange processes necessary for supersolidity would be promoted by vacancies even in the bulk crystal far from dislocation cores . simulations with numbers of particle orders of magnitude larger",
    "are needed to answer the question whether the number of dislocations cores will increase with the system size and with the number of vacancies to give a finite concentration of dislocations able to induce odlro even in a macroscopic 2d @xmath0he crystal , but this is actually beyond our computational possibilities and we have to leave it for future investigations . moreover ,",
    "how much the phase correlation triggered by dislocations depends on the concentration of dislocations and its relevance for the 3d solid @xmath0he are still open questions .",
    "our results mainly indicate that the usual concepts of commensurate or incommensurate solid , borrowed from lattice models , is not appropriate for solid helium , a system where the crystal lattice is not externally imposed , but is self - induced by the correlation among particles .",
    "in fact , the number of lattice sites @xmath21 is found to be an ill defined quantity when the crystal houses many vacancies / dislocations .",
    "we do not address the origin ( intrinsic or extrinsic ) of the vacancies / dislocations studied in the present paper .",
    "the issue if the ground state could contain zero point defects is still debated.@xcite in case the ground state of solid @xmath0he contains defects , our findings suggest that the andreev  lifshitz ",
    "chester scenario@xcite would in a certain sense revive , but in terms of _ ground state dislocations _ rather than vacancies .",
    "on the other hand , even if the ground state has no zero point defects , our findings suggest that in presence of extrinsic disorder this will manifest more in terms of fluctuating dislocations rather than vacancies , at least at low @xmath124 and in 2d .",
