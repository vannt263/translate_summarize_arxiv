    "thanks to the progresses in spatial astrometry , the errors of measurements of the positions of stars are gradually decreasing : the errors of the along  scan measurements were a few milli  arcseconds in the _ hipparcos _ project @xcite , but the _ gaia _ satellite @xcite is expected to achieve 100 times better @xcite .",
    "this limit will still be pushed beyond 1  @xmath0as when interferometry with large baseline will be feasible in space .",
    "it is expected that , with a 9-m baseline , _ sim _ could already get an accuracy of only 0.6  @xmath0as for a single measurement @xcite .",
    "these important improvements will not only lead to more accurate results .",
    "they make also necessary to take into account effects that were never considered in the past .",
    "a first example was the correction for perspective acceleration , that was introduced for a few high - velocity single stars in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue .",
    "the radial velocities ( rv ) of these stars were used for that purpose , but @xcite have shown that the rv may also be derived from this effect .",
    "@xcite developed a relativistic model taking into account the light deflection by solar system objects .",
    "@xcite and @xcite outlined that some basic parameters as the trigonometric parallax , the proper motion and the rv deserve to be defined more precisely than they are at present ; the definition of the rv was discussed by @xcite . concerning binary stars ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the variations of the light  travel time ( ltt ) coming from the orbital motion may change the apparent position of the component . since this effect",
    "is related to the radial displacement of the component , they inferred that it could be used to dissipate the ambiguity of the position of the ascending node of the orbit .",
    "another effect which could be used for node identification is the modification of the orientation of the orbit during the time span of the astrometric program . for sake of brevity",
    ", it is called ` local perspective ' ( lp ) hereafter . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "the perspective effects concerning the barycentre of binary systems , but also single stars ( i.e. perspective acceleration and change in the parallax ) , are called ` barycentric perspective ' hereafter .    in the course of a high - precision astrometric project , taking perspective and ltt effects into account could be necessary for two reasons .",
    "first of all , when the effects are relevant , the quality of the solution is improved .",
    "the astrometric and orbital parameters are then more accurate , and , even more important , the solution itself will look more ` acceptable ' . the decision to consider a model as adequate is usually based on the goodness - of - fit ( gof ) of the solution , which may , for instance , follow the normal distribution @xmath1 when the model is the right one .",
    "therefore , a large gof leads to the rejection of the model , and to the search of another one .",
    "in the course of a large astrometric survey , like _ hipparcos _ , objects which are not satisfactorily fitted eventually got a ` stochastic ' solution , which is of rather poor interest .",
    "therefore , a binary model neglecting perspective or ltt effects could change actual binary stars in stochastic objects , losing the orbital elements . aside from giving the right classification with accurate parameters , the second advantage of giving a precise solution is the possibility to get more informations about the object . for single stars , as mentioned above , taking into account perspective acceleration can lead to an estimation of the rv . for binaries , a consequence of the additional effects could be the complete derivation of the orientation of the orbit in space .",
    "this is investigated hereafter .",
    "calculations were performed in order to answer three questions : what is the smallest astrometric error still permitting to neglect lp and ltt without altering dramatically the gof for unresolved binaries ? what is the largest astrometric error permitting to derive the precise ascending node thanks to lp and ltt ?",
    "what is the smallest astrometric error still permitting to neglect lp and ltt without altering the masses of resolved binary components ? the basic equations of lp are derived in section  [ sec : lp ] , and it is shown how to select the right ascending node thanks to this effect . a method for selecting the ascending node from ltt",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : ltt ] . in section  [ sec : relat ] , it is verified that the relativistic effects , which were neglected in the calculations , are much smaller than lp and ltt effects for nearby binaries with large semi  major axes .",
    "the parameters of simulated unresolved astrometric binaries were derived in section  [ sec : simulation ] , and the ascending nodes were searched . resolved binaries are treated in section  [ sec : resolved ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "we want to derive the angular coordinates of binary components in a tangential reference frame moving with the barycentre . at the beginning ,",
    "the components are located in the ` local equatorial reference system ' of the object , which is defined as a trihedron having the origin on the barycentre of the binary , and with the vectors @xmath2 oriented as follows : @xmath3 is prolongating the line of sight , @xmath4 is oriented toward east , and @xmath5 is oriented to north , in order to complete the direct trihedron ( figure  [ fig : lptrans1 ] ) .",
    "the angular coordinates are lengths divided by the distance from the sun . at the epoch @xmath6",
    ", the object is moving in space with the angular velocity ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the third coordinate , @xmath8 is the ` radial proper motion ' , which is always expressed in radians per time unit .",
    "it may be derived from the rv , @xmath9 , and from the parallax , @xmath10 , using the equation @xmath11 , where @xmath9 is in au per time unit and @xmath10 is in radians ; @xmath12 is the speed of light , in the same unit as @xmath9 .",
    "we consider a point with a fixed position in an inertial reference frame attached to the barycentre ( for instance : the periastron of an astrometric orbit ) .",
    "when the binary is moving , the angular coordinates of this point in a local reference system attached to the barycentre are resulting from a set of consecutive transformations :    1 .   a rotation about the radial axis , @xmath13 , for aligning the first coordinate axis along the proper motion in the ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) tangential plane ( figure  [ fig : lptrans1 ] ) .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath16 is derived from + @xmath17 @xmath18 + let ( @xmath19 ) be the new reference system , and let @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the coordinates of the point in this system .",
    "2 .   the transformation of the ( @xmath19 ) reference system in ( @xmath23 ) , due to the displacement of the star .",
    "this transformation consists in a rotation about @xmath24 of an angle @xmath25 , and in a correction of the angular coordinates when the distance of the barycentre , @xmath26 , is changed in @xmath27 ( figure  [ fig : lptrans2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath25 is the motion of the barycentre due to the proper motion , and , in a first order approximation , @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the coordinates in the ( @xmath29 ) system are : + @xmath30 + where @xmath31 refers to the ( @xmath19 ) frame",
    ". 3 .   a rotation about the radial axis @xmath32 must still be applied in order to get the coordinates of the point in the most suitable reference frame for the forthcoming calculations . in section  [ sec : abscissa ] , the motion of the binary is projected on a unique equatorial tangential plane , corresponding to a point arbitrarily chosen . this plane is called the ` average ' equatorial tangential plane hereafter ; for simplicity , we chose , for reference frame , the local equatorial tangential frame of the beginning , ( @xmath33 ) . therefore , we need , for each barycentric position , an orientation of the ( @xmath34 ) axes such that the projections of these axes on the average equatorial tangential plane are parallel to ( @xmath33 ) , respectively . since the projection of the motion of the barycentre is a straight line on the average plane , this condition is achieved by applying to the ( @xmath23 ) frame a rotation with the angle @xmath35 .",
    "the ( @xmath36 ) frame thus obtained is called the ` local standard reference system ' hereafter .",
    "+ in a first order calculation , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the products between the angular motions , such as @xmath39 , are negligible .",
    "therefore , the ( @xmath40 ) coordinates in the ( @xmath36 ) reference frame are given by the equations : + @xmath41_{rad } \\ ; z_0   \\label{eq : cooper1}\\ ] ] + @xmath42_{rad } \\ ; z_0 \\label{eq : cooper2}\\ ] ] + @xmath43_{rad } \\ ; x_0 + [ \\mu_{\\delta } t]_{rad } \\ ; y_0 \\label{eq : cooper3}\\ ] ] + where ` @xmath44_{rad}$ ] ' means that the angle between the brackets is converted in radians ( @xmath45 is also in radians , according to the definition of @xmath8 above ) .",
    "+ an anonymous referee pointed out that the local standard reference system ( @xmath36 ) is not a local equatorial reference system , contrarily to the ( @xmath46 ) frame of the beginning of the calculation . the coordinates in the local equatorial reference system",
    "are not used in the derivation of the orbital elements with the method of the average equatorial tangential plane , in section  [ sec : simulation ] , but they may be relevant for high - velocity binary stars , when this method can not be applied .",
    "for that reason , they are derived hereafter . + for getting the coordinates in the local equatorial reference system of the barycentre",
    ", it would still be necessary to add a rotation about @xmath3 with an angle equal to the rotation of the north , but in the opposite direction . if @xmath47 is the correction to be added to the position angles measured inside the celestial sphere , as in the usual definition ( figure  [ fig : lptrans1 ] ) , then , the angle of the rotation to apply to the ( @xmath36 ) reference frame for getting an equatorial frame is also @xmath47 .",
    "it comes from the basic formulae of spherical trigonometry @xcite that @xmath47 is given by the exact equation : + @xmath48 + when @xmath25 is small , the equation above may be simplified assuming @xmath49 .",

    "two different sets of parameters are commonly used to entirely describe an orbit in space . both",
    "are including the period , @xmath54 , the eccentricity , @xmath55 , and the periastron epoch , @xmath56 .",
    "these parameters may be completed with the angular semi - major axis , @xmath57 , and the campbell s angles , which are : the inclination , @xmath58 , the position angle of the ascending node , @xmath59 , and the so - called longitude of periastron , @xmath60 , which is measured from the ascending node ; the definitions of these angles may be found in any double star handbook @xcite .",
    "hereafter , the semi - major axis refers to the astrometric orbit of the primary component , which should not be confused with the relative ` visual ' orbit of a resolved binary system .",
    "the nodes are the intersections between the orbit and the ( @xmath34 ) plane ; the ascending node is the one where the star is moving away from the sun .",
    "it is worth noticing that the positions of the nodes are derived from astrometric data , but that the ascending node is usually not known when no rv measurement is available . for an astrometric orbit , @xmath59 and @xmath60 refer then to the node with @xmath59 between 0 and @xmath61",
    "however , when the right ascending node is eventually found , it may be the other one , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are then changed in @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the second set of parameters which are frequently used are the thiele - innes elements ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "these elements are functions of @xmath57 and of the campbell s angles , so it is possible to go from one system to the other and vice - versa @xcite . however , changing @xmath59 and @xmath60 in @xmath62 and @xmath63 does nt change ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "reciprocally , changing ( @xmath64 ) in ( @xmath65 ) leads again to the ambiguity in the choice of the node .",
    "the thiele - innes elements are completed with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are defined by the following equations :    @xmath68    @xmath69    these two additional elements are not entirely redundant with the four former , since they indicate the true ascending node , when it may be fixed . otherwise , it is impossible to discriminate between ( @xmath70 ) and ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the six thiele - innes elements , ( @xmath72 ) , are completely fixing the orbit of a binary component in space . in the local reference system defined in section  [ sec : local : trans ] above , the direction cosines of the semi - major axis and of the semi - minor axis of the orbit are ( @xmath73 ) and ( @xmath74 ) respectively .",
    "the transformation of ( @xmath64 ) by lp is obtained by applying equations ( [ eq : cooper1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cooper2 ] ) to these coordinates ; one obtains :    @xmath75_{rad } \\ ; c_0",

    "\\label{eq : abfgt}\\ ] ]    it is worth noticing that the elements thus obtained are not the _ true _ thiele - innes elements , since the position angle of the line of nodes is not measured exactly from the local north , but from the @xmath5 vector , ie from the north at @xmath6 .    the position of a binary component is derived from the ( @xmath64 ) elements with the classical formulae ; in the ( @xmath76 ) coordinate system defined in section  [ sec : local : trans ] , they are :    @xmath77    with    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the eccentric anomaly at the epoch @xmath80 .      as explained in section  [ sec : ascendingnode ] , when the actual ascending node is not known , the ( @xmath81 ) elements correspond to two sets ( @xmath82 ) : the first one with @xmath83 and the second one with @xmath84 .",
    "however , thanks to the perspective effect , it is possible to discriminate between the two possibilities , using the following method : the ( @xmath64 ) elements at each observation epoch are derived from equation ( [ eq : abfgt ] ) , and the model positions of the binary component are derived twice , assuming the two @xmath60 .",
    "the right ascending node will provide the solution with the smallest @xmath85 .",
    "our aim is to estimate of the size of the lp effect under the best conditions . for that purpose ,",
    "we consider a binary at a distance of 5  pc . in order to get estimations applying for resolved binaries as well as for unresolved binaries ,",
    "the mass ratio ( mass of the secondary component divided by that of the primary one ) @xmath86 is assumed . for resolved binaries ,",
    "the semi - major axis of the secondary orbit is then exactly twice that of the primary , and for unresolved binaries , the magnitude difference is large enough for neglecting the difference between the position of the primary and that of the photocentre .",
    "the semi - major axis of the primary orbit is set to 1  au ; for a 1-solar mass primary and @xmath86 , this corresponds to a period of @xmath87  years .",
    "the assumed time span of the observations is 5 years , like the expected duration of the _ gaia _ mission .",
    "the orbit is then entirely covered by the observations . in order to choose a reasonable proper motion , a velocity of 25  km / s is assumed for each axis : this value is close to the standard deviation of the velocity of late - type dwarfs , in any direction @xcite .",
    "we consider now an edge  on orbit with the semi ",
    "major axis along the line of sight and the periastron between the barycentre and the sun .",
    "therefore , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ; assuming that the star is exactly at the opposite of the periastron when @xmath905  years , one obtains @xmath91 , and equation ( [ eq : xy ] ) leads to @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "applying equations ( [ eq : abfgt ] ) and ( [ eq : xy ] ) , the coordinates of the component are : @xmath94_{rad } \\ ; a \\ ; ( 1+e)$ ] , and @xmath95_{rad } \\ ; a \\ ; ( 1+e)$ ] , instead of 0 when the perspective effect is absent .",
    "the offset in position in then @xmath96  @xmath0as for a nearly circular orbit .",
    "this estimation applies to a 1  au semi - major axis at a distance @xmath97  pc , but it may be adapted to other values .",
    "since the thiele - innes elements are varying as @xmath98 and the @xmath99 coordinates are varying as @xmath100 the lp effect is varying as @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , it is vanishing rapidly when distant stars are considered .",
    "the light coming from a component orbiting around the barycentre of a binary system is arriving with a delay , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the delay of light coming from the barycentre , and where @xmath104 is coming from the position of the component on the orbit .",
    "for that reason , @xmath104 is called the ` orbital delay ' hereafter .",
    "it is negative when the component is closer to the sun than the barycentre , and negative otherwise .",
    "the analytic expression of @xmath104 was derived by @xcite . for our purpose ,",
    "a simple calculation neglecting the relativistic corrections is sufficient , as it will be shown in section  [ sec : relat ] .",
    "the radial angular coordinate with respect to the barycentre is derived from @xmath66 and @xmath67 with the following equation @xcite :    @xmath105    therefore , the orbital delay is    @xmath106    where @xmath12 is expressed in au per time unit , and where @xmath10 is in the same unit as @xmath107 ,",
    "i.e. as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "an astrometric measurement obtained at the epoch @xmath80 then provides the position of the component at the epoch @xmath108 .",
    "this induces a shift of the position of the star which is related to the orbital motion , but also to the proper motion of the barycentre ( see the fig .  2 in anglada - escud & torra ) .",
    "as for lp , the choice of the true ascending node is feasible trying the two possibilities . shifting from one node to the other consists in changing the sign of @xmath107 , and then of @xmath104 .",
    "again , the ascending node should provide the best fit when this effect is visible .      for comparing the offset of position due to the orbital delay to the lp effect evaluated in section  [ sec",
    ": sizelp ] , the same hypotheses are assumed . with an edge - on orbit ,",
    "the orbital delay is then as large as 8.3 minutes at maximum .",
    "the corrections of position coming from the orbital motion and from the proper motion are evaluated hereafter .",
    "the orbital velocity is given by the equation :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the mass of the primary star , in solar unit ; @xmath111 is assumed .",
    "with @xmath86 , and a period of 4.24 y , @xmath112 . for 8.3  min ,",
    "the correction is then 4.7  @xmath0as for the primary component at a 5  pc distance .",
    "when another distance or another semi - major axis ( i.e. another period ) are considered , since @xmath104 is proportional to @xmath113 , this correction is varying as @xmath114 .",
    "again , it is also twice larger for the secondary component than for the primary .      since the primary component is observed with an orbital delay @xmath104 , the position of the barycentre which is used as origin of the orbital motion is no more corresponding to the epoch @xmath80 , but to @xmath115 .",
    "the apparent orbit is then distorted , since @xmath104 is varying in relation with the orbital motion .    for consistency with section  [ sec : sizelp ] , a tangential velocity of @xmath116",
    "km / s is assumed .",
    "therefore , the correction of the position for a 8.3  min delay is 24  @xmath0as for a distance of 5  pc .",
    "this term is varying as @xmath117 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the parallactic motion is not affected by @xmath104 , since it is due to the position of the earth with respect to the sun at the time of the observation .",
    "in sections  [ sec : lp ] and [ sec : ltt ] above , the relativistic effects due to the displacement of the binary with respect to the barycentre of the solar system were ignored . in this section",
    ", it is verified that this approximation does nt matter to the problem we are dealing with .",
    "the linear motion of the barycentre of the binary has two consequences : the lengths along the direction of the displacement are shortened , and time is dilated .",
    "the coordinate of the primary component along the velocity vector , @xmath118 , is then multiplied by @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , with the same hypotheses as above ( spatial velocity of @xmath120  km / s , orbital radius of 1  au , distance of 5  pc ) we get a change in position that may be as large as @xmath121  @xmath0as .",
    "this is much smaller than the lp or ltt effects .",
    "the effect of time dilatation is as if , for the observer , the period of the binary is increased by @xmath122 .",
    "this linear modification of time has no effect on our calculations .",
    "anyway , it induces an amount of only 1.4  s for a 4.2 year period .",
    "we may also consider the deflection of light by the mass of the secondary component .",
    "for a distant binary object , we use the approximate formula of light bending @xcite :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the gravitational constant , @xmath110 is the mass of the deflecting star , and @xmath125 is the ` impact parameter ' of the ray , measured from the centre of the deflecting star .",
    "therefore , in the reference system defined in section  [ sec : lp ] , the deflection of the light emitted by the primary component by the secondary component is , approximately :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the radial angular coordinate of the observed component ( labelled ` 1 ' ) in a local reference system with component 2 as origin ; therefore , deflection occurs only when @xmath128 . with the same hypotheses as before",
    ", we have @xmath129 solar mass , @xmath130  arcsec .",
    "the light deflection may then be as large as around 1.3 @xmath0as when @xmath131  solar radii .",
    "this is not negligible , but corresponds to a rather rare situation , i.e. an orbit almost perfectly edge - on .",
    "since @xmath132 is varying as @xmath133 , it vanishes very fast when @xmath125 is increasing from a very small value .",
    "when the median value of @xmath134 radians is assumed for the orbital inclination , @xmath135  @xmath0as only . in conclusion , light bending may be neglected in a first approximation , although it may be important for some systems .",
    "it comes from section  [ sec : sizelp ] and [ sec : sizeltt ] that lp and ltt effects could significantly alter the position of the photocentre of an unresolved binary when the accuracy is around 10 @xmath0as .",
    "however , simulations are necessary to evaluate when the signatures of these effects should be visible in reality .    in this section ,",
    "we attend to answer the two questions addressed in the introduction : 1 ) how does the distribution of the gof look when lp and ltt are neglected ? , and 2 ) when is it possible to select the actual ascending node in practice ?        several hypotheses in [ sec : binsimu ]  [ sec : sizelp ] are assumed again for generating virtual binaries : the mass of the primary component is 1 solar mass and that of the invisible companion is 0.5 solar mass .",
    "the period is 4.24 years , so that the semi - major axis of the astrometric orbit is exactly 1  au ; the distance is 5  pc .",
    "in addition , each coordinate of the barycentric velocity obeys a normal distribution with the standard deviation of 25  km / s , the positions of the stars are randomly distributed on the sky , and the orbits are not circular , but have eccentricities obeying the distribution of @xcite .",
    "the orientations of the orbits are purely at random : the inclinations obey a sinus distribution , and the @xmath59 and @xmath60 angles obey constant distributions .      in order to reproduce the data coming from a rotating satellite or an interferometer , we consider one - dimensional astrometric coordinates ( ` abscissae ' hereafter ) measured along an axis with a varying orientation . for a given binary system , the origin of the abscissa corresponds to a fixed position close to the position of the barycentre at @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wbin ] ) .",
    "virtual observations are produced assuming a rough approximation of the _ gaia _ scanning law , consisting in around 16 visibility periods ( vp , hereafter ) in 5 years , separated by a duration a bit longer than 100 days .",
    "a constant orientation is randomly fixed for each vp , which contains 2 or 3 pairs of scans .",
    "the total number of measurements is 83 on average .",
    "each pair corresponds to a complete rotation of the satellite in 6 hours . the second scan of the pair is coming 106  min after the first one . for any scan",
    ", an abscissa is derived , and an error is generated from a normal distribution with a constant standard deviation , @xmath136 .      the easiest way to derive the parameter of a star is to consider its motion in the average equatorial tangential plane defined in section  [ sec : local : trans ] . when the distance @xmath137 between the origin and the barycentre of the star is small , the curvature of the celestial sphere may be neglected , and it is assumed that @xmath138 .",
    "the coordinates of a binary component in the local standard tangential plane , ( @xmath34 ) , seen in section  [ sec : local : trans ] may then be directly transposed to the average equatorial tangential plane , neglecting the tilt with the angle @xmath137 between the two planes ( see figure  [ fig : tancoo ] ) ; they are just added to the coordinates of the barycentre .",
    "however , we must verify that the curvature of the celestial sphere may really be neglected .",
    "assuming a 5  pc distance and a velocity as large as @xmath139 on each axis in the tangential plane , one obtain , @xmath140  arcsec yr@xmath141 .",
    "for half the duration of a 5  yr mission , this implies a displacement of 7.5  arcsec .",
    "the difference between the angular distance and its projection on the tangent plane is then only 0.003  @xmath99as .",
    "it is then quite possible to use the plane approximation , even when astrometric errors as small as 0.1  @xmath99as are considered .",
    "the calculation of the abscissa of the star for the observation epoch @xmath80 is performed in several steps , which are roughly summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : wbin ] .",
    "hereafter , lp and ltt affects are introduced in the calculation ; about the orbital delay , since it is much smaller than the period of the binary , a first order approximation is used : the eccentric anomaly @xmath79 is computed , and the @xmath107-coordinate and the orbital delay @xmath104 are derived , from equations ( [ eq : z ] ) and ( [ eq : dt ] ) .",
    "the eccentric anomaly corrected for ltt , @xmath142 , is then computed , and the @xmath143 and @xmath144 coordinates in an equatorial rectangular frame are derived from equation ( [ eq : xy ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the orbital motion to the abscissa of the star , @xmath145 , is the projection of the ( @xmath146 ) coordinates on the abscissa axis .",
    "when @xmath147 is the position angle of the axis , @xmath145 is given by the expression :    @xmath148    the abscissa of the star is then derived by still adding to @xmath145 the position of the barycentre , @xmath149 .",
    "the perspective effects concerning single stars are then taken into account : the parallax is varying due to the radial motion , and the proper motion is affected by perspective acceleration @xcite .",
    "therefore , the abscissa of the barycentre , @xmath149 , is given by the equation :    @xmath150    where @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 are the position , parallax and proper motion of the barycentre at the epoch @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "@xmath156 is the partial derivative of @xmath157 with respect to the actual parallax at the observation epoch @xmath80 .",
    "it depends on the coordinates of the binary and on the position of the earth on its orbit .",
    "the @xmath158 coefficient is due to barycentric perspective .",
    "the introduction of barycentric perspective in the simulated @xmath149 is necessary for being realistic , and it is very relevant in practice : in the next section , it will make possible the derivation of the rv with the other parameters ; therefore , it contributes efficiently to the correction of the lp effect when the rv is not measured spectroscopically .",
    "it is worth noticing that the effect of the epoch correction in this term is negligible , and that it is possible to simply use @xmath159 .",

    "it is worth noticing that equations ( [ eq : wo ] ) to ( [ eq : w ] ) are not specific to an observation mode , and apply to any coordinate axis .",
    "when 2-d measurements are considered , the ordinates obey the same formulae as the abscissae ; only one parameter is changing : the position angle of the coordinate axis , @xmath147 .",
    "thirteen parameters are necessary to entirely fit the motion of the primary component of a binary system , _ plus _ the indication of the ascending node . in the usual order ,",
    "these parameters are :    * the 6 parameters of the barycentre of the binary at the reference epoch @xmath6 .",
    "these parameters are the five ones listed in section  [ sec : abscissa ] above ( i.e. @xmath162 ) , and the rv , @xmath9 .",
    "contrarily to the parallax and the proper motion , the rv is assumed to be constant .",
    "this parameter is optional in the calculation of the solution , since it may be obtained independently from the astrometric data ; for instance , it will be derived from spectroscopic observations in the _ gaia _ project .",
    "therefore , two different cases are considered hereafter : the case with known rv , and the case without velocity measurement , for which @xmath9 is included among the unknowns of the astrometric solution . * the thiele - innes elements at the reference epoch @xmath6 , which are ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "two sets of the elements @xmath164 and @xmath165 may correspond to these 4 elements , as indicated in equations ( [ eq : c ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) . for each of them ,",

    "measured ' abscissae , the astrometric and orbital elements are derived three times , always taking into account the barycentric perspective effects : a first solution is derived from a simple orbital model , ignoring the local effects related to the z - dimension .",
    "lp and ltt are taken into account in the two other solutions , which are obtained assuming the right ascending node , and the other one , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath172 , defined as the difference : ` gof of the false ascending node solution ' _ minus _ ` gof of the right ascending node solution ' is then derived .",
    "our aim is to estimate a limit of astrometric errors beyond which neglecting lp and ltt would increase the rate of rejected solutions . for that purpose , the solutions derived without lp and ltt are considered .",
    "the distributions of the gof when the actual rv is assumed is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff2passcor ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : ff2mursscor ] refers to the solutions obtained including the rv among the unknowns .    on both figures",
    ", it appears that a 10  @xmath0as error does nt alter the distribution of the @xmath169 estimator , which just looks like the normal distribution @xmath173 .",
    "a significant excess of systems with @xmath174 appears only when @xmath136 is less than 1  @xmath0as when the rv is known , and when @xmath175  @xmath0as otherwise .",
    "the errors leading to visible lp or ltt effects are rather small when compared to the estimations in section  [ sec : sizelp ] and [ sec : sizeltt ] .",
    "the reason is that the offsets of positions due to these effects are partly compensated by altering the orbital elements .",
    "in fact , the modification of the orbital elements is so efficient that the @xmath85 of the solution does nt change significantly when it is accounted for the ltt effect .",
    "this appears when simulations are performed assuming null velocities for the barycentres of the systems , in order to suppress the lp effect .",
    "the gof of the solutions are then always obeying the same normal distribution , no matter such effect is taken into account , and no matter the precise choice of the ascending node . on the other hand , the errors of the derived eccentricities and of the campbell s angles are much larger when the wrong node is assumed in place of the right one : for instance , for the eccentricities , when @xmath176  @xmath0as , the ratio is already more than 2 .",
    "therefore , taking ltt into account improves the quality of the solution , but it does nt help in the selection of the ascending node .",
    "it is worth noticing that this conclusion applies to unresolved binaries , and that the ltt effect is more visible in resolved binaries , as explained in section  [ sec : resolved ] .",
    "the differences @xmath172 defined in section  [ sec : sollp - ltt ] were derived from the solutions taking lp and ltt into account , and their distributions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdgofpa ] and [ fig : fdgofmur ] .",
    "it comes from these plots that , for some systems , @xmath169 may be used to select the ascending node even when the astrometric error is too large for providing an excess of large gof in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff2passcor ] and [ fig : ff2mursscor ] . for instance ,",
    "when @xmath177  @xmath0as , the distribution of @xmath172 is clearly asymmetric , and @xmath178 means that the true ascending node is very probably the one with the smallest @xmath169 .      not surprisingly , the solutions derived assuming the actual rv of the barycentre are more efficient in the node selection than that including the calculation of @xmath9 . since the actual rv can never be measured in practice , the results above can only refer to rv ` accurate enough ' ; but what accuracy may still be considered as ` enough ' ? in order to answer this question , we consider the rv errors when @xmath9 is derived from the astrometric measurements . the standard deviation of these errors , @xmath179 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigdrv ] , as a function of the astrometric error , @xmath136 .",
    "an average rv measured with an uncertainty much smaller than @xmath179 may be considered as equivalent to the actual one .    in the _ gaia _ project",
    ", it is expected to get the average rv of the brightest systems , with an accuracy of a few km / s .",
    "this is much less than the rv error when @xmath9 is derived from the astrometric measurements , since the astrometric error of each _ gaia _ measurement will be much larger than the upper limit of the range of @xmath136 considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigdrv ] .",
    "therefore , the possibility to find the true ascending node with _ gaia _ could be obtained through the solutions assuming the actual rv .",
    "unfortunately , since the error of the astrometric _ gaia _ measurements at epoch ( not to be confused with the average astrometric error ) will be much larger than 10  @xmath0as , and it is obvious that lp and ltt may both be ignored in the preparation of the _ gaia _ catalogue .",
    "the resolved astrometric binaries are less frequent than the unresolved ones , but they are also more relevant , since the masses of the components are then directly obtained from the astrometric solution .",
    "the derivation of the parameters is not very different from the calculation seen above : the abscissae of the primary component are again given by equation ( [ eq : w ] ) , and the method described in section  [ sec : sollp - ltt ] may be applied with the parameters of the primary component in place of that of the photocentre .",
    "the abscissae of the secondary component are slightly different .",
    "it is necessary to add a parameter to that of the primary , in order to derive the thiele - innes elements of the secondary .",
    "the simplest method consists in adding the secondary semi - major axis , @xmath180 .",
    "the six thiele - innes elements of the secondary may then be derived from that of the primary , since @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and so on , until @xmath183 ( a method for deriving @xmath184 from @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 is in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath107 and @xmath104 may be derived for the secondary using the same formulae as for the primary .    when the parameters of the binary have been computed , the masses of the components are derived from    @xmath191    where the masses are in solar units when @xmath184 and @xmath180 are in the same unit as @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath192 is the period at rest , expressed in years ; it is derived from the apparent period , after correction for the doppler effect : @xmath193 .        instead of repeating the calculations performed for unresolved binaries , it is more appealing to consider a real nearby binary , and to search when lp and ltt must be taken into account in order to get masses as accurate as possible .",
    "the sample of nearby systems for which the orbital elements are already known is rather scarce .",
    "2mass j07464256 + 2000321 roughly fulfils the requirements : it is a reasonably nearby system ( 12 pc distant ) , with a period long enough for having a wide angular separation between the component ( semi - major axis of 0.2 arcsec ) , but short enough ( 10.5 y ) for permitting observations covering a complete orbit . nevertheless , the observation frequency used in section  [ sec : simulation ] is adapted hereafter in order to keep the same number of observations although the time - span is extended up to 12 years .",

    "as expected , they are quite acceptable for @xmath136 larger than 2 @xmath0as , i.e. when the ascending node can not be determined .",
    "we have study the impact of two effects which have been neglected up to now in astrometric studies of binary systems : the local perspective , and the orbital light  travel time .",
    "these effects are related to the orientation of the orbit in space , and taking them into account may lead to the position of the ascending node of the orbit , i.e. to the orientation of the spin vector .",
    "the statistical distribution of the spin orientations is a clue in the study of binary formation .",
    "it was derived and discussed in the past by @xcite and , more recently by @xcite .",
    "the global distribution of the spin looks isotropic , but glebocki concluded from a sample of 252 orbits that subgroups seem to have asymmetric distribution .",
    "an extension of his sample would allow to re - consider this question .",
    "we have found that neglecting ltt does nt affect the @xmath85 of the solution for unresolved binaries , since it is compensated by a bias in the orbital elements , essentially the eccentricity and the orientation of the orbit .",
    "the reason is that ltt does nt change the shape of the apparent orbit ; only the observation epochs are affected , in relation with the orbital phase .",
    "therefore , neglecting ltt ca nt lead to discarding the binary model . on the other hand , taking it into account for stars with distances @xmath97  pc would significantly improve the accuracy of the orbital elements when the astrometric accuracy @xmath136 is a few @xmath0as . for other distances ,",
    "the minimum @xmath136 is varying as the inverse of @xmath27 .",
    "the ascending node of unresolved astrometric binary orbits may be found from the lp effect .",
    "however , for that purpose , astrometric measurements with accuracy around 1  @xmath0as and beyond are required . when the barycentric radial velocities are known , and therefore taken into account in the correction of perspective acceleration , lp must be taken into account when the errors of the astrometric measurements are less than the 1  @xmath0as limit .",
    "the binary star model could be erroneously discarded otherwise , since the gof of the solution would look excessive .",
    "when the radial velocities are not available , they are derived from the barycentric perspective effects ; however the corrections for lp are then necessary only when the errors of the astrometric measurements are less than 0.5  @xmath0as . as for ltt ,",
    "the results depending on lp apply to binaries at a distance @xmath97  pc , with velocities typical of population i late - type dwarfs , and with semi - major axes of 1  au . for other parameters ,",
    "they are unchanged when the astrometric errors are varying in the same proportions as the velocities and the semi - major axes , and in the inverse proportion of @xmath204 .",
    "the resolved binaries were examined through the example of 2mass j07464256 + 2000321 , a brown dwarf system for which all the parameters are already known , the ascending node excepted .",
    "the ltt effect is not compensated by alteration of the orbital elements as for unresolved binaries , since it plays in opposite directions for both components .",
    "it appeared that neglecting lp and ltt would lead to erroneous masses when the errors of the astrometric measurements are around 20  @xmath0as .",
    "however , when the astrometric error is larger than 1 or 2  @xmath0as acceptable evaluations of the masses may be obtained from a ` degenerate lp solution ' .",
    "this calculation does nt require the knowledge of the ascending node since it consists in correcting the semi - major axis for distance variations .",
    "however , when the astrometric error is around 1  @xmath0as , the degenerate lp solution is no more acceptable , and only a calculation entirely taking into account lp and ltt may lead to masses as accurate as permitted , through the determination of the ascending node .",
    "since these results apply to a specific binary at a distance of 12  pc and with very light components , it is highly probable that a few binaries in the forthcoming _ gaia _ mission will require a degenerate lp solution for getting accurate masses . on the other hand , complete lp+ltt solutions will be necessary only when measurements with errors around 1  @xmath0as will be available for nearby binaries , possibly thanks to the _",
