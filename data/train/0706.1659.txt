    "the study of transport in one - dimensional aperiodic lattices may be modeled by the nearest - neighbors tight - binding hamiltonian ( schrdinger operator ) in @xmath0 @xmath1 with  @xmath2 and potentials @xmath3 generated by aperiodic sequences . in many circumstances",
    "the potentials are real - valued functions of sequences on a finite set @xmath4 , called _ alphabet _ ; these are models of one - dimensional quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "quantum interferences may lead to localization of the solutions of the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath5 as in case of ( random ) bernoulli potentials @xcite , but also to ballistic motion , mainly related to periodic potentials .    among the characterizations of localization and transport we single out the second moment of the position operator @xmath6 usually with initial condition concentrated on a single site @xmath7 . for a large class of potentials the moment @xmath8 ( at least for @xmath9 ) and",
    "if @xmath10 holds we have the definition of _ ballistic motion_. localization will be characterized by a bounded function @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; lack of localization is usually referred to as _ delocalization _ or _ transport_. half the way between these extremes are the _ anomalous transport _ , that is , @xmath13 which are usually accompanied by singular continuous spectrum of the operator @xmath14 .",
    "important examples of such anomalous behavior are the above cited models of quasicrystals , among which the most prominent are the ( primitive ) substitution sequences @xcite , for instance , fibonacci , thue - morse and period doubling sequences .",
    "the schrdinger operators whose potentials are generated by these sequences have singular continuous spectrum of zero lebesgue measure ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a widespread spectral point of view makes the association of singular continuous spectrum with anomalous transport , absolutely continuous to ballistic motion and point spectrum of the schrdinger operator with localization , even though there are known exceptions , namely of operators with purely point spectra showing transport .",
    "even rank one perturbation ( a very localized one ) can exchange point and singular continuous spectra @xcite , and the latter surely implies transport ( any continuous spectrum does , as a consequence of rage theorem ) .",
    "what about unlocalized perturbations , i.e. , those spread over the whole lattice ?",
    "certainly this becomes a too huge class of problems to be reasonably dealt with .",
    "however , there is a special type of such perturbations we think it is worth considering and may be of some ( experimental ) relevance in the near future .",
    "a particular model of quasicrystal , as a substitution sequence , is an almost periodic sequence that grows up from a seed ( i.e. , an initial condition ) and a specific `` growing rule . ''",
    "if one has control of the growing technique , one could grow a quasicrystal in one direction following one such rule , and in a perpendicular direction following another rule .",
    "this hybridization creates a potential which is a linear ( convex ) combinations of the original ones .",
    "this type of long range perturbations of the potentials can also be considered from the theoretical point of view , the sequence spaces are two - dimensional and have been considered before @xcite .",
    "the potentials we shall consider are constructed as follows .",
    "given two _",
    "parent _ potentials @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the _ hybrid potential _ is @xmath18 experience with random potentials indicates that if one of them is random then this characteristic will prevail with respect to localization . if both potentials are periodic , then the resulting one will also be periodic with period given by their least common multiple .",
    "so , in these extreme cases again , localization and ballistic motion , respectively , are persistent .",
    "note that the number of values a hybrid potential assumes is in general larger than the number of values of each of its components ; e.g. , if both @xmath19 take values in @xmath20 , then @xmath21 will generally assume all values in @xmath22 .",
    "this work is an initial study on this proposal , and we will limit ourselves to almost periodic potentials taking a finite number of values ( notably , substitution sequences ) .",
    "we present theoretical results on minimality , and data for the moment @xmath23 from numerical time evolution simulations .    section  [ sectbrss ] review briefly some aspects of finitely valued sequences . in section  [ sectminimality ]",
    "we address the question about minimality of the product of minimal sets , giving a sufficient condition for it . in section  [ sectnumerics ]",
    "we report some outcomes of numerical simulations of the moment @xmath23 for the hybrid potentials , closing in the final section with our concluding remarks .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) the sets of finite ( resp .  bi - infinite ) words with letters in the finite set @xmath4 ( called _ alphabet _ ) , which can be considered a subset of the real numbers .",
    "the metric on @xmath25 is @xmath26 a dynamics on this set is the ( left ) shift @xmath27 .",
    "recall that a sequence @xmath28 is almost periodic iff its hull ( the bar indicates the closure of the set ) @xmath29is minimal , that is , the hull of any sequence in @xmath30 coincides with @xmath30 .",
    "the set @xmath31 is the orbit of @xmath32 . by tychonov",
    "theorem @xmath25 is compact and so is every hull as above .",
    "the minimality is an important property of the hull of ( primitive ) substitution sequences ( see ahead ) , as well as the existence of a unique ergodic measure , and up to now rigorous and numerical studies have revealed just one dynamical behavior in each minimal component ( usually rigorous results are restricted to generic or full measure sets ) .",
    "so , as a first step in the study of such new class of systems , in this work we address the problem of minimality of the hull of hybrid sequences in case their respective parent potentials are almost periodic . setting a product metric ,",
    "the dynamics with respect to which one considers minimality , is on the product space of the hulls of the two parent potentials , and is generated by the ( natural ) product shift @xmath33 we use the same notation for the shift in two and one - dimensional sequences . in order to investigate the minimality of the product spaces it turns out to be important hybridizing not only of @xmath32 and @xmath34 , but also of elements of their one - dimensional orbits ; namely , to consider @xmath35 , for each @xmath36 .    a finite word @xmath37 is indexed @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the length of @xmath37 .",
    "given a set of infinite words @xmath41 , the _ language _ of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , is the set of finite words occurring in some @xmath43 .",

    "this is the procedure we use to construct almost periodic substitution potentials @xmath68 .",
    "it is known that the spectrum of the operator  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with finite - valued aperiodic and almost periodic potentials has no absolutely continuous component ( primitive substitutions are included ) @xcite ; although from a rigorous point of view the lack / presence of eigenvalues in cases of primitive substitution sequences is an open question , as already remarked , no strong evidence of the presence of eigenvalues and localization was found yet .",
