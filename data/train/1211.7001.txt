    "preservation of memory is an important goal for every kind of coherent quantum process .",
    "the type of control that this implies becomes more difficult in cases involving multi - particle cooperation , typically including entanglement in some way .",
    "preservation of entanglement is often an important goal itself .",
    "since dissipation processes induced by natural environments will eventually or quickly take entanglement all the way to zero , two related criteria emerge for consideration .",
    "these are ( a ) the minimum degree of entanglement that is still  useful \" , setting a lower bound for entanglement , a threshold disentanglement ( td ) value that must not be crossed , and ( b ) the length of time during which this useful level must be maintained .",
    "for example , in order for a quantum computation task to be successful , the decay time to reach the low entanglement threshold must be longer than the time scale for computation .",
    "natural environments induce well - known single - party decoherence times ( @xmath2 , etc . ) , but these are often not helpful or even highly misleading because it is well known that disentanglement can , and often does , proceed by its own distinct evolution channel and is notoriously able , in only a finite time , to reach complete disentanglement ( cd ) , colloquially known as entanglement sudden death @xcite . clearly a cd event may possibly violates the td value at a given time .",
    "this has led a number of entanglement restoration methods to be proposed , using schemes of local unitary operations @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , feedback control @xcite , dynamical decoupling @xcite , and environment assisted error correction @xcite , in order to control and restore entanglement during environmental exposure .",
    "the proposals @xcite have shown that while these schemes may delay or even avert the occurrence of cd in some cases , they may also counter - intuitively accelerate or even induce cd . the proposal by zhao , et al .",
    "@xcite relies on finding random unitary or non - random unitary kraus decompositions , which are relatively difficult to achieve and are absent for universal decay channels .",
    "proposals of entanglement preservation based on dynamical single - qubit population trapping have also been presented via the exploitation of structured quantum environments or suitable classical environments @xcite and experimental confirmation has also been realized @xcite .",
    "a second category of strategies is disentanglement prevention , in which specific setups are made before the disentanglement process .",
    "one typical approach of this category is to establish a decoherence free subspace @xcite , which requires either increasing the number of non - computing redundant qubits to create certain symmetry , or some engineering of the system or reservoir with serious external contacts .",
    "another approach is to control disentanglement through initial conditions , i.e. , during the state preparation process .",
    "isolated connections between cd time and initial conditions have been identified extensively ( see for example @xcite and a review @xcite ) .",
    "huang and zhu derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for cd for a generic two - qubit state under amplitude damping and phase damping channels through the positivity requirement of seven principal minors of a @xmath3 matrix @xcite .",
    "fanchini et al .",
    "@xcite have extended the results of huang and zhu to more general dissipative hamiltonians .",
    "however , such cd conditions engage almost every matrix element of a given two - qubit initial state through various matrix transformations , and are extremely complex to control in reality .",
    "recently , we have shown that the susceptibility to cd can be controlled via initial entanglement and purity for a simple type of two - qubit states that undergo symmetric amplitude damping dissipation @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility of pre - managing disentanglement properties with just a few controllable initial resources .",
    "yang et al .",
    "@xcite followed this by showing that the cd pre - management procedure is also viable for extended werner - like initial states .",
    "however , for practical situations , initial states may be arbitrarily mixed and decay channels can be rather versatile and complex .",
    "an open challenge arises : is it still possible to manage cd with only limited controllable initial parameters for practical complex situations .",
    "a further question follows naturally : is it also possible to include the threshold disentanglement condition within the control process ?",
    "an important complication is that even for the simple case of x - form matrices ( first systematically considered by yu and eberly @xcite ) , the cd time can only be found for specific types of states , such as werner - like states , ansatz states , etc . , or symmetric reservoir interactions ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the complication is mainly due to the fact that the disentanglement process , as well as measures of entanglement such as schmidt weight @xcite , concurrence @xcite , negativity @xcite , etc .",
    ", are usually non - linear functions of time for given initial conditions .",
    "this is because these non - linear dependences usually correspond to higher order linear equations that are difficult to solve analytically ( see our detailed analysis in section iii ) .",
    "for example , no analytic cd time is obtained for arbitrary x - form states with non - symmetric amplitude damping and depolarization channels .",
    "however , here we make use of the fact that such difficulties can be avoided if one considers the inverse of the problem . that is , we will obtain the state s initial conditions for an arbitrarily given cd or td time .",
    "this corresponds to practical situations when a particular quantum information task requires cd or td to happen no earlier than a prescribed time @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in this paper we extend our previous analysis of cd pre - management @xcite by considering arbitrary two - qubit mixed states , and by treating non - symmetric damping of the two qubits for three different quantum channels , i.e. , amplitude damping , phase damping , and depolarization . at the same time",
    ", we show explicitly for the first time the pre - management of threshold disentanglement properties and illustrate their connections with cd .",
    "we first analyze the entanglement dynamics of an arbitrary x - form two - qubit mixed state .",
    "exact cd - free , cd - no - go , cd - tolerable , td - no - go , and td - tolerable phases are explicitly determined in terms of several initial parameters , i.e. , concurrence and excitation probabilities .",
    "two types of intuitive and counter - intuitive situations are discussed .",
    "we then extend the static entanglement lower bound relation for x - form matrices , developed recently by ma et al .",
    "@xcite and hashemi rafsanjani et al .",
    "@xcite , to the dynamical evolution of the state .",
    "we show that cd and td phase critical conditions of a generic state are lower bounded by these of its x - form component .",
    "therefore the control of different cd and td properties of a general complex mixed state can be realized sufficiently through just a few initial parameters of its x - form component .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we demonstrate the time evolution of a generic two qubit state under three quantum channels .",
    "the dynamics of x - form mixed states are shown explicitly .",
    "section iii gives a detailed demonstration of cd and td phases for x - form states in all three quantum channels . in section iv ,",
    "the static entanglement lower bound conditions between the x - form and the entire matrix is generalized to the dynamical process , and is then used to determine the lower bounds of cd and td phases for the generic time dependent state .",
    "it is then followed by summary and acknowledgement sections .",
    "in spite of the rapid development of multi - partite and multi - dimensional entanglement studies recently ( see for example @xcite , and references therein ) , qubit - qubit entanglement remains as the central element for most quantum information and quantum computation technologies @xcite . in practice ,",
    "real state preparations may be inevitably deviated from ideal target states .",
    "therefore , we consider the most general form of a prepared two - qubit ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) mixed initial state , i.e. , @xmath6 which is expressed in the standard basis : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are usually interpreted as excited and ground states of qubits @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "it is obvious that such a matrix can always be decomposed into a sum of x - form and o - form matrices , i.e. , @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 and its non - zero matrix elements form an  x \" shape , and @xmath15 contains the remaining non - zero matrix elements that form an  o \" shape .    another important practical aspect is the decoherence effect caused by unavoidable environmental interactions after state preparation . for a relatively complete illustration , we study three most commonly considered quantum channels , i.e. , amplitude damping , phase damping and depolarization , that represent various physical system - reservoir interactions .",
    "we consider the case when each qubit is independently interacting with a local reservoir .",
    "then the evolution of the two - qubit initial state can be straightforwardly described by kraus operator representations @xcite , i.e. , @xmath16 where the joint kraus operators @xmath17 , satisfying the relation @xmath18 , correspond to all possible tensor products of individual kraus operators of qubits @xmath4 , @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 represent all possible kraus operators for qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .    in the following",
    "we will demonstrate explicitly for all three quantum channels the evolution of x - form state ( [ x - form initial ] ) , which is a valid density matrix by itself .",
    "so we denote the initial state with @xmath22 , and the time dependent state is obtained as @xmath23 .",
    "an amplitude damping channel can schematically model physical processes such as spontaneous emission , spin chain heisenberg interactions , etc .",
    "it describes a situation of energy dissipation from the excited state of a two level system to its ground state .",
    "the corresponding kraus operators for such a damping qubit , e.g. , qubit @xmath4 , are given as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the excitation - transfer probability that grows from @xmath26 to @xmath27 irreversibly , and @xmath28 denotes the probability that qubit @xmath4 remains in its excited state .",
    "the kraus operators for qubit @xmath5 are characterized similarly with a decay probability @xmath29 .    by applying the kraus operators ( [ kraus - amplitude ] ) to the initial state @xmath22",
    "one obtains the explicit time evolution as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "one notes that as time goes to infinity , the population will be transferred completely into the ground state , i.e. , the matrix element @xmath37 .",
    "a phase damping channel characterizes noisy processes where relative phase coherence in a system decays over time due to perturbation .",
    "it models various physical situations such as photon scattering in a waveguide , electronic state perturbations in an atom , etc .",
    "the kraus operators for a phase damping qubit are given as , say for qubit @xmath4 , @xmath38 where @xmath25 is the probability that the system has been scattered off by the reservoir , @xmath39 is the probability remain unchanged .",
    "the kraus operators of qubit @xmath5 has a scattering probability @xmath40 .    given the kraus operators , the time evolution of the initial state @xmath22 under phase damping can be easily obtained as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "since the phase damping perturbation only causes off - diagonal coherence loss , the diagonal terms remain fixed in the time dependent state .",
    "depolarization is another important type of decoherence channel that describes physical situations when a system ( qubit ) suffers bit flip and phase flip errors from environmental interactions .",
    "it is a process in which a qubit density matrix remains intact with probability @xmath44 , and changes into a completely unpolarized ( depolarized ) state @xmath45 with probability @xmath46 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath47 represents a unit matrix . for a depolarizing qubit @xmath4",
    ", there are four kraus operators , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a re - scaled probability , @xmath28 , and @xmath50 with @xmath51 are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "the kraus operators of qubit @xmath5 has a re - scaled depolarizing probability @xmath40 .",
    "one then can straightforwardly achieve the time dependence of the x - form initial state @xmath22 under depolarization channel , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 here we have set @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we see that the time dependent matrix @xmath61 will evolve into a completely unpolarized state @xmath45 as time goes to infinity .    we have shown that for all three channels the time evolution of the initial state @xmath22 retains an  x \" form @xcite .",
    "this property plays an important role for the analysis of cd and td phases in following sections .",
    "type ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 type ( @xmath64 ) of two - qubit matrices respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]   type ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 type ( @xmath64 ) of two - qubit matrices respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]",
    "we now analyze the entanglement dynamics of the x - form initial state @xmath22 , under all three channels , by focusing on the question : how do initial conditions affect the properties of both cd and td .",
    "the degree of entanglement , i.e. , concurrence @xcite , for @xmath65 takes a very compact form @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath67 there is zero initial entanglement , i.e. , @xmath68 , when @xmath69 and @xmath70 . obviously , this is not an interesting case , and so we will consider cases when either @xmath71 or @xmath72 is positive ( matrix positivity does not allow both of them to be positive simultaneously ) .",
    "then the initial concurrence is expressed conveniently as @xmath73 for @xmath74 , or @xmath75 when @xmath76 .",
    "accordingly , we call the x - form matrix ( [ x - form initial ] ) as well as its generic mother matrix ( [ general initial ] ) as a @xmath77 matrix if @xmath74 , or a @xmath63 matrix otherwise . fig . [ matrix ]",
    "gives a schematic illustration of both types of matrices . in practice ,",
    "a slightly imperfect preparation of a @xmath77-like or @xmath63-like bell state may lead to the generation of such a @xmath77 or @xmath63 matrix .      for amplitude",
    "damping , the time evolution of the initial state @xmath22 is given in eq .",
    "( [ x - amplitude time ] ) . since it retains the x form , the time dependent concurrence can be simply obtained as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 the irreversible damping process indicates that the product @xmath81 is decreasing while the parameter @xmath82 is increasing with time .",
    "this guarantees the decay of both @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus one has the time dependent concurrence , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath77 and @xmath63 type of initial states respectively .    in the following two subsections ,",

    "in summary we have investigated a new type of disentanglement prevention method , i.e. , pre - management with limited partial resources of initial conditions , for a generic two - qubit system that undergoes three typical decoherence channels . the process of threshold disentanglement ( td ) is analyzed for the first time , and its intuitive and counter - intuitive connections to initial entanglement and to complete disentanglement ( cd ) phenomenon are analyzed explicitly .",
    "our analysis illustrates systematically the fundamental connections between open system initial conditions and its disentanglement properties . at the same time",
    ", it may also serve as guidance to experimental preparation of robust entangled states .",
    "the disentanglement properties of a general x - form initial state are demonstrated with various exact cd and td phases in terms of just a few initial parameters , i.e. , concurrence and excitation probabilities .",
    "these disentanglement phases are shown to have provided lower bounds for the corresponding phases of a generic two - qubit initial state . in this way , the initial parameters of the x - form component amount to a set of management tools that can tune the generic and complex state into particular phases with preferred disentanglement properties .",
    "the nature of phase analysis allows a well defined amount of margin for errors in practical imprecise state preparations .",
    "our treatment of solving initial conditions for a prescribed time scale @xmath1 has avoided much of the difficulty in determining the timing of cd and td , and thus is capable to deal with many complex situations ( e.g. , generic two - qubit decay under non - symmetric amplitude damping and depolarization channels ) that could nt be solved analytically in previous studies .",
    "such analysis is well grounded by practical situations when a desired disentanglement time scale is pre - determined by quantum information tasks .",
