    "in contrast , the singularity at @xmath102 in the lower equation is less important in the bec regime when @xmath93 , because dos is finite only when @xmath103 .",
    "since the negative @xmath14 in the bec regime is a strong - coupling effect associated with the formation of tightly bound molecules@xcite , the suppression of the coherence peaks in the bec regime at @xmath82 may be also regarded as a strong - coupling effect . from the above discussion , we find that the coherence peaks in dos may be used to determine the region where strong - coupling effects are less important and one can discuss superfluid properties to some extent within the _ weak - coupling mean - field _ bcs theory .     and intensity of spectral weight @xmath64 in the weak - coupling bcs regime ( @xmath104 ) . , width=377 ]     for @xmath105 ( unitarity limit).,width=377 ]     for @xmath106 ( bec regime).,width=377 ]    we now consider the superfluid dos @xmath107 below @xmath1 .",

    "one can see the growth of the coherence peaks in panels ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) , and the bcs - type superfluid dos having a clear gap structure with sharp coherence peaks is eventually realized far below @xmath1 ( panel ( a4 ) ) .",
    "we note that a similar continuous evolution from the pseudogap to the superconducting gap has been observed in the underdoped regime of high-@xmath108 cuprates@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] also shows the intensity of sw in the right panels . as discussed in our previous paper@xcite ,",
    "the pseudogap phenomenon in sw is not remarkable in the bcs regime .",
    "indeed , a peak line corresponding to the free particle dispersion @xmath109 is only seen in panel ( b1 ) , although the pseudogap can be clearly seen in panel ( a1 ) .",

    "we obtain quite different results in the unitarity limit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in this case , panel ( a2 ) clearly shows that the superfluid gap structure is still absent around @xmath87 even at @xmath111 .",
    "this is because , although the superfluid order parameter @xmath75 itself is finite , the superfluid gap structure in dos is smeared out by strong pairing fluctuations at this temperature .",
    "however , panel ( a2 ) also shows that pseudogap structure becomes obscure , indicating the suppression of pairing fluctuations ( although they are still strong enough to smear out the superfluid gap in dos ) .",
    "this suppression of pseudogap below @xmath1 can be also seen in sw . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b1 ) , we can see the typical pseudogap structure of sw , namely , the double - peak structure consisting of a positive energy ( particle ) and negative energy ( hole ) branches . at @xmath111 ( panel ( b2 ) ) , this double - peak structure becomes obscure due to the appearance of finite spectral intensity around @xmath87 .",

    "[ fig6](a3 ) shows that a dip structure appears around @xmath87 .",
    "correspondingly , sw also has a gap structure at @xmath87 , as shown in panel ( b3 ) .",
    "these superfluid gap structures develop at lower temperatures , and they eventually reduce to the bcs - type dos and sw far below @xmath1 , as shown in panels ( a4 ) and ( b4 ) , respectively@xcite .",
    "the above results indicate that , in the crossover region , the superfluid gap appears in dos after the pseudogap almost disappears .",
    "this is quite different from the continuous evolution from the pseudogap to the superfluid gas in the weak - coupling bcs regime . since strong pairing fluctuations , which is essential for the pseudogap phenomenon ,",
    "must be suppressed to obtain the superfluid gap in dos and sw , the evolution from the pseudogap to superfluid gap is a competing phenomenon in the crossover region .    in the strong - coupling bec regime ,",
    "since tightly bound molecules have been already formed far above @xmath1 , dos has a clear gap structure even at @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath4 is the so - called pseudogap temperature discussed in our previous paper@xcite , where the pseudogap starts to emerge in dos above @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we also take into account the fact that physical properties in the strong - coupling bec regime are close to those of a molecular bose gas , rather than a fermi gas . noting that the molecular binding energy @xmath135 in this regime is deeply related to the fermi chemical potential as @xmath136 when @xmath93",
    ", one may expect that the thermal dissociation of molecules is suppressed in the bec regime when @xmath137 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "thus , it is convenient to regard the right side of the @xmath132-line in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) as the molecular bose gas regime@xcite .",
    "we briefly note that @xmath138 , @xmath4 , and @xmath132 , are all crossover temperatures without being accompanied by any phase transition .    using these three characteristic temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) , we find that the region `` pg '' in fig .  [ fig8](b ) , which is surrounded by @xmath4 , @xmath134 , and @xmath132 , is the one where the pseudogap structure in dos is remarkable .",
    "thus , we conveniently call this region the _ pseudogap region _ (",
    "although , strictly speaking , the region below @xmath1 is the superfluid state ) . in this pseudogap regime ,",
    "strong pairing fluctuations induce a gap - like structure in dos in both the normal and superfluid phases .",
    "below @xmath134 ( `` sf '' in fig .  [ fig8](b ) ) , instead of the disappearance of the pseudogap , the superfluid gap starts to develop in dos , so that single - particle properties are dominated by superfluid gap .",
    "as one further decreases the temperature below @xmath134 , one eventually obtains the weak - coupling bcs - type dos characterized by a clear excitation gap and coherence peaks , as discussed in sec .",
    "iii . to conveniently include this",
    ", we also introduce the characteristic temperature @xmath133 at which the coherence peaks appear in dos@xcite in fig .",

    "[ fig8](b ) ) , a large single - particle excitation gap already exists above @xmath1 , reflecting a large molecular binding energy ( @xmath139@xcite ) .",
    "this large binding energy suppresses single - particle excitations accompanied by pair breaking in the superfluid phase below @xmath1 , so that excitations are dominated by collective bogoliubov modes , as in the case of bose superfluid . in this sense , we call the superfluid region in the molecular bose gas regime the bec of molecular bosons ( `` mbec '' in fig [ fig8](b ) ) .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated single - particle excitations and strong - coupling effects in the bcs - bec crossover regime of a superfluid fermi gas . extending our previous work above @xmath1 to the superfluid phase below @xmath1",
    ", we have numerically calculated the superfluid dos , as well as sw , within the @xmath0-matrix theory .",
    "we have systematically examined how the pseudogap at @xmath1 evolves into the superfluid gap , as one decreases the temperature below @xmath1 .",
    "while the evolution is continuous in the weak - coupling bcs regime , the superfluid gap was shown to appear in dos after the pseudogap is suppressed below @xmath1 in the crossover regime . using these results ,",
    "we have identified the pseudogap region where strong pairing fluctuations dominate over single - particle properties in the phase diagram of a cold fermi gas .",
    "since the observation of single - particle excitations has recently become possible in cold fermi gases by photoemission - type experiment , measurements of single - particle excitation spectrum affected by strong pairing fluctuations discussed in this paper would be an interesting problem to understand the strong - coupling superfluid properties in the bcs - bec crossover .    in this paper",
    ", we have assumed a uniform fermi gas , for simplicity . in a trapped system , it is an interesting problem how the spatial inhomogeneity affects the evolution from the pseudogap to the superfluid gap below @xmath1 . since a real fermi gas",
    "is always trapped in a harmonic potential , this is also an important issue in comparing experimental data with theoretical calculations .",
