    "highly - collimated , oppositely directed jets are observed in active galaxies and quasars ( see for example bridle & eilek 1984 ) , and in old compact stars in binaries ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; eikenberry _ et al .",

    "recent work favors models where twisting of an ordered magnetic field threading an accretion disk acts to magnetically accelerate the jets ( meier , koide , & uchida 2001 ) .",
    "there are two regimes : ( 1 ) the _ hydromagnetic regime _ , where energy and angular momentum are carried by both the electromagnetic field and the kinetic flux of matter , which is relevant to the jets from young stellar objects ; and ( 2 ) the _ poynting flux regime_. where energy and angular from the disk are carried predominantly by the electromagnetic field , which is relevant to extra - galactic and microquasar jets , and possibly to gamma ray burst sources .",
    "stationary poynting flux dominated jets have been found in axisymmetric mhd simulations of the opening of magnetic loops threading a keplerian disk ( romanova _ et al . _",

    "here , we consider further the theory of poynting outflows ( li _ et al .",
    "we assume that magnetic field loops threads a differentially rotating highly conducting keplerian accretion disk at some initial time @xmath3 . above the disk",
    "we assume a `` coronal '' or force - free magnetic field in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "this situation is described by the force - free grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation for the flux function @xmath0 which labels the poloidal field lines ( in cylindrical coordinates ) .",
    "the gs equation involves a function @xmath1 describing the distribution of poloidal current which is determined by the differential rotation or _",
    "twist _ of the disk which increases linearly with time .",
    "we numerically solve the gs equation in a sequence of volumes of increasing size corresponding to the expansion of the outer perfectly conducting boundaries at ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the outer boundaries model the influence of an external non - magnetized plasma .",
    "the sequence of gs solutions provides a model for the dynamical evolution of the magnetic field in response to ( 1 ) the increasing twist of the disk and ( 2 ) the pressure of external plasma .",
    "cylindrical @xmath4 coordinates are used and axisymmetry is assumed thus the magnetic field has the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 we can write @xmath7 where @xmath8 . in the force - free limit , the magnetic energy density @xmath9 is much larger than the kinetic or thermal energy densities ; that is , the flow speeds are sub - alfvnic , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the alfvn velocity . in this limit , @xmath12 ; therefore , @xmath13 ( gold & hoyle 1960 ) . because @xmath14 , @xmath15 and consequently @xmath16 , as well - known .",
    "thus , ampre s equation becomes @xmath17 .",

    "ampre s law gives @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 is @xmath29 times the current flowing through a circular area of radius @xmath18 ( with normal @xmath30 ) labeled by @xmath0= const .",

    "we consider an _ initial value problem _ where the disk at @xmath3 is threaded by a dipole - like poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the form of @xmath1 is then determined by the differential rotation of the disk : the azimuthal _ twist _ of a given field line going from an inner footpoint at @xmath43 to an outer footpoint at @xmath44 is fixed by the differential rotation of the disk .",
    "the field line slippage speed through the disk due to the disk s finite magnetic diffusivity is estimated to be negligible compared with the keplerian velocity . for a given field line we have @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the poloidal arc length along the field line , and @xmath47",

    "the nature of the solutions changes dramatically as the twist increases above a critical value @xmath93 rad .",
    "for @xmath94 the nature of the field solutions is shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the twisting of the field by the differential rotation of the disk `` pumps '' magnetic flux and energy into the disk corona and the field tends to `` inflate . ''",
    "this behavior of coronal magnetic field loops of the sun as a result of footpoint twisting is well known from the works of aly ( 1984 , 1991 ) and sturrock ( 1991 ) .",
    "the self - similar inflation of a force - free field threading a non - keplerian disk without outer boundaries was studied lynden - bell and boily ( 1994 ) and their solution for small twists is analogous to our low - twist solutions .",
    "the expansion of a force - free field into finite pressure external plasma has been studied by lynden - bell ( 1996 ) and li _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) and the _ poloidal field _ is found to fairly uniformly fill the coronal space .",
    "for @xmath95 , a new field configuration appears with a different topology .",
    "this is shown in figure 5 where it is seen that a `` plasmoid '' consisting of toroidal flux has detached from the disk and is separated by the dashed field line which has an @xmath96point above the @xmath39point on the disk .",
    "figure 6 shows a 3d view of two representative field lines for the same case .",
    "these high - twist equilibria consist of a region near the axis which is _ magnetically collimated _ by the toroidal @xmath97 field and a region far from the axis , on the outer radial boundary , which is _ anti - collimated _ in the sense that it is pushed against the outer boundary .",
    "the field lines returning to the disk at @xmath98 are anti - collimated by the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field . the _ poloidal field",
    "_ fills only a small part of the coronal space . in a purely analytical analysis , heyvaerts ( 2001 )",
    "has independently found mhd equilibria involving the simultaneous formation of a collimated axial jet and an uncollimated outflow .",
    "figure 6 shows a three dimensional view of sample field lines .    as a test of our numerical solutions",
    "note that conservation of axial momentum can be written as @xmath99 integration of equation ( 5 ) over the `` box '' @xmath100 gives @xmath101 where the integral on the left hand side represents the flux of momentum from the disk into the box and the other integral the flux of momentum out of the top of the box .",
    "this equation is accurately satisfied by our numerical solutions ; the typical errors are @xmath102 .",
    "most of the twist @xmath103 of a field line of a poynting jet occurs along the jet from @xmath69 to @xmath70 . because @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 where @xmath106 is evaluated on the straight part of the jet at @xmath107 . in the core of the jet @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 , and in this region we can take @xmath110 , and @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are dimensionless constants . equation ( 1 ) for the straight part of the jet implies @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "thus we find @xmath116 so that @xmath117 , @xmath118^{2/3}{\\cal k}^{4/3}$ ] , and @xmath119 .    in order to have a poynting jet",
    ", we find that @xmath120 must be larger than @xmath121 .",
    "this corresponds directly to the condition @xmath122 for the occurrence of the high - twist solutions .",
    "the condition arises from the fact that there is a competition between the build up of toroidal flux inside the box due to twisting by the disk which acts to increase @xmath97 and the expansion of the boundaries which acts to decrease @xmath97 ( see  12 ) .",
    "if the boundaries expand too rapidly @xmath97 does not increase sufficiently to give a self - collimated poynting jet .",
    "for the case of uniform expansion of the top boundary , @xmath123 , this condition is the same as @xmath124 . for the case of figure ( 5 ) , @xmath125 .",
    "the field components in the straight part of the jet are @xmath126 these dependences agree approximately with those found in numerical simulations of poynting jets ( ustyugova _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . on the disk ,",
    "@xmath127 for @xmath128 . using this and",
    "the formula for @xmath129 gives the relation between the radius of a field line in the disk , denoted @xmath130 , and its radius in the jet , @xmath131 .",
    "thus the power law for @xmath21 is applicable for @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 , with @xmath135 the inner radius of the disk .",
    "the outer edge of the poynting jet has a transition layer where the axial field changes from @xmath136 to zero while ( minus ) the toroidal field increases from @xmath137 to @xmath138 . using equation ( 6 ) , which is only approximate at @xmath44 , gives @xmath139",
    ", this dependence agrees approximately with our grad - shafranov solutions .",
    "the magnetic forces on the outer wall increase by a large factor in going from the low - twist to high - twist solutions .",
    "the radial force on the cylindrical wall and the axial force on the top wall are @xmath140 for the low - twist solution of figure 3 ( @xmath141 ) , @xmath142 , whereas for the high - twist solution of figure 5 ( @xmath143 ) , @xmath144 in units of @xmath145 .",
    "figure 7 shows the radial dependence of the magnetic pressure on the top boundary for the cases of low - twist and high - twist solutions .",
    "different behavior is exhibited by the low - twist and high - twist solutions as the conducting boundaries are moved outward .",
    "for the low - twist solutions , the poloidal field tends to expand outward to fairly uniformly fill the available space . as @xmath74 and @xmath146 , we find that these solutions are similar to those obtained by lynden - bell and boily ( 1994 ) where there are no outer boundaries .",
    "in contrast , for the high - twist solutions , the poloidal field near the axis maintains its collimation due to @xmath97 , whereas the `` return '' poloidal field far from the axis is pushed against the outer cylindrical wall due to the @xmath97 field . as @xmath74 and @xmath146 ,",
    "the collimated field near the axis will extent outward along the @xmath85axis in the absence of instabilities .",
    "it is clear from figure 7 that the magnetic pressure on the top boundary peaks near the axis .",
    "thus , this region of the boundary should expand most rapidly in the physical case where the boundary is an interface with external plasma .",
    "estimation of the axial expansion of a poynting jet can readily be made assuming a region of radius @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) of the jet expands with velocity @xmath149 into a constant density external medium .",
    "for likely conditions @xmath149 is much larger than the sound speed in the external medium so that the ram pressure due to the jet motion is @xmath150 , assuming @xmath151 as required by our non - relativistic treatment . balancing this pressure with the magnetic pressure of the jet gives _ extv_z^2 ~(-h)_max^2 4g^2 r_2 ^ 2 ~0.14 [ b_z(0)/g]^2 ( r_0_0/v_z)^4  , or @xmath152^{1/3 } /\\rho_{ext}^{1/6}~.\\ ] ] the condition for a poynting jet @xmath153 corresponds to @xmath154 . for @xmath155 g , @xmath156 cm , and @xmath157 , the external density @xmath158 must be larger than @xmath159 in order to have @xmath160 . for larger magnetic fields ,",
    "a much larger external density is needed to give @xmath160 .",
    "this points up the need for a relativistic treatment of the poynting jet expansion .",
    "conservation of angular momentum about the @xmath85axis can be written as @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the angular momentum flux - density vector .",
    "integration of equation ( 11 ) over the `` box '' @xmath100 gives @xmath163 the subscript @xmath69 here and subsequently indicates that the quantity is evaluated on the top surface of the disk . for a dipole - like field threading the disk where @xmath164 , equation ( 12 ) gives @xmath165",
    "the first integral represents the outflow of angular momentum from the inner part of the disk ( interior to the @xmath39point ) , and this equals the angular momentum inflow into the outer part of the disk given by the second integral .",
    "the outflow of angular momentum from the inner part of the disk causes enhanced accretion of this part of the disk , whereas the inflow of angular momentum to the outer disk reduces the accretion rate .",
    "because the poynting outflows carry negligible matter , the continuity equation for the disk is @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the surface mass density of the disk .",

    "the disk is assumed almost keplerian so that @xmath171 and consequently the two continuity equations give the mass accretion rate @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the `` magnetically driven '' mass accretion rate , and @xmath174 is the viscous accretion rate with @xmath175 the kinematic viscosity ( lovelace , newman , & romanova 1997 ) .",

    "figure 8 shows the radial dependence of @xmath182 for a high - twist case . that @xmath182 due to the poynting outflow is a function of @xmath18 emphasizes the fact that disk is not stationary",
    "poloidal magnetic field threading the disk tends to be advected inward with the accretion flow , but at the same time it may diffuse through the disk owing to a finite magnetic diffusivity @xmath183 of the disk .",

    "note that there may be `` self - regulation '' in the respect that the field configuration which occurs is at the `` boundary '' between low and high - twist solutions . in view of figure 7 , the low - twist field gives a gradual expansion of the boundaries which allows build up of toroidal flux whereas the high - twist field gives a more rapid expansion which tends to give a slower increase of @xmath229 .",
    "the region of collimated field ( see figure 5 ) - the poynting jet - has @xmath280 and is kink unstable according to the standard non - relativistic analysis ( e.g. , bateman 1980 , ch .",
    "the instability will lead to a helical distortion of the jet with the non - linear amplitude of shift of the helix @xmath281 and with the helix having the same twist about the @xmath85axis as the axisymmetric @xmath73 field .",
    "note however that for the astrophysical conditions of interest @xmath282 is likely to be larger than the speed of light .",
    "a relativistic perturbation analysis is then required including the displacement current .",
    "the physical alfvn speed is @xmath283 .",
    "thus the speed of lateral displacement of the helix is less than c. the evolution of the poynting jet evidently depends on _ both _ @xmath284 and the velocity of propagation of the `` head '' of the jet @xmath149 (  5 ) which may be relativistic .",
    "relativistic propagation of the jet s head may act to limit the amplitude of helical kink distortion of the jet . on the other hand",
    "a sub - relativistic propagation of the head may allow the helix amplitude to grow but this amplitude can be limited by flux conservation as discussed by kadomtsev ( 1963 ) .",
    "for the mhd simulations described here , the initial magnetic field has a dipole - like form as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the computational region @xmath67 to @xmath285 , @xmath69 to @xmath286 is taken to have @xmath287 .",
    "initially , the corona of the disk is in isothermal equilibrium without rotation . at @xmath3",
    "the disk starts to rotate with keplerian velocity @xmath288 , where @xmath289 , where the smoothing length @xmath290 is interpreted as the inner radius of the disk .",
    "the smoothed gravitational potential is @xmath291 .    on the disk surface ,",
    "the boundary conditions are as follows ( ustyugova _ et al .",
    "two of the boundary conditions come from the fact that the tangential electric field @xmath292 in the frame rotating with the disk ( at the keplerian velocity ) is zero ; @xmath293 at the disk surface is time - independent whereas @xmath294 and @xmath97 at the surface vary with time .",
    "two further boundary conditions fix the entropy of the plasma coming out of the disk to be @xmath295 and the density of the outflowing plasma to be @xmath296 .",
    "if @xmath297 at the disk surface , calculated by solving the mhd equations in the computational region , increases to the point where it is larger than the slow magnetosonic speed in the @xmath85direction at the disk s surface @xmath298 , then we clamp it to be equal to @xmath298 .",
    "this condition represents a limit on the mass efflux @xmath299 from the disk . for sub - slow magnetosonic outflow from the disk @xmath300",
    ", we have four boundary conditions , whereas when @xmath301 we have five boundary conditions .    for the outer boundaries",
    ", we first consider the case where these surfaces are perfect conductors .",
    "secondly , we consider the case of `` free '' outer boundaries where @xmath302 on all scalar variables _ except _ for the toroidal magnetic field . for this field component we take @xmath303 = 0 $ ] on the outer boundaries , which was shown by ustyugova _",
    "( 1999 ) to avoid artificial collimation which can come from using the `` free '' boundary condition on @xmath304 .",
    "the free outer boundary conditions allow matter and poynting flux to freely flow out through these surfaces .    for the cases we discuss",
    ", the strength of the poloidal magnetic field at the inner radius of the disk corresponds to @xmath305 and @xmath306 , where @xmath307 .",
    "the @xmath308subscript indicates evaluation at the inner radius of the disk @xmath309 on the disk surface . in the midplane of the disk @xmath310 is less than or much less than unity .",
    "different radial profiles of @xmath192 on the disk surface have been used with similar results , including @xmath311 const and @xmath312 const ; the density profiles on the disk surface have been obtained as in ustyugova _",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "figure 9 shows the evolution of the coronal plasma for the case of fixed , conducting outer boundaries at @xmath100 .",
    "after about @xmath313 rotation periods of the inner disk , the outgoing poloidal field collimates along the @xmath85axis , and the returning poloidal field is pressed outwards to the conducting walls .",
    "most of the magnetic field is strongly field - dominated with flow speeds @xmath314 , where @xmath11 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "the field configuration is similar to that found for the high - twist grad - shafranov solutions as shown in figure 5 .",
    "figure 10 shows the long time evolution of the coronal plasma for the case where the outer boundaries are free ( i.e. , open ) boundaries .",
    "these simulations evolve to a quasi - stationary final state where most of the region is strongly field - dominated . in the jet region along the @xmath85axis , the poloidal field",
    "is collimated by the @xmath97 field .",
    "we find that the profiles of @xmath315 and @xmath316 from the simulations ( ustyugova _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) agree to a good approximation with equation ( 6 ) of our analytic model .",
    "the main respect in which the simulations differ from the grad - shafranov solutions is that region close to the disk where the magnetic field returns to the disk is _ not _ field - dominated .",
    "instead this region has a hydromagnetic outflow from disk .",
    "this is predicted theoretically ( blandford & payne 1982 ) and observed in simulations ( ustyugova _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) to be the case when the angle @xmath244 between the disk normal and the poloidal field lines is larger than @xmath245 .",
    "an ordered magnetic field threading an accretion disk can give powerful outflows or jets of matter , energy , and angular momentum .",
    "most of the studies have been in the hydromagnetic regime where there is appreciable mass outflow and find asymptotic flow speeds of the order of the maximum keplerian velocity of the disk , @xmath317 .",
    "these flows are clearly relevant to the jets from protostellar systems which have flow speeds of the order of @xmath317 . in contrast , observed vlbi jets in quasars and active galaxies point to bulk lorentz factors @xmath318 - much larger than the disk lorentz factor . in the jets of gamma ray",
    "burst sources , @xmath319 .",
    "the large lorentz factors as well as the small faraday rotation measures suggest that these jets are in the poynting flux regime .",
    "this work presents self - consistent solutions for the axisymmetric , non - relativistic plasma equilibria described by the force - free grad - shafranov equation .",
    "we find solutions with _ magnetically collimated _ poynting jets where there is a _ continuous _ outflow of energy , angular momentum , and toroidal magnetic flux from the disk into the external space .",
    "this behavior contradicts the commonly accepted `` theorem '' of solar plasma physics that the motion of the footpoints of a magnetic loop structure leads to a stationary magnetic field configuration with zero power , angular momentum , and flux outflows ( aly 1984 , 1991 ) .",
    "important issues remain to be investigated - the relativistic expansion of the head of a poynting jets into an external medium and the three - dimensional kink instability of the jet .",
    "further , the magnetic extraction of energy from a rotating black hole may be important ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; livio , ogilvie , & pringle 1999 ) .",
