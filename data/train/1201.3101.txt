    "pulsars are thought to be neutron stars ( nss ) since the discovery of the first pulsar @xcite . nevertheless , the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron stars is not clear till now .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the true ground state of hadrons may be strange matter , which contains roughly equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks .",
    "it is then realized that a quark star or strange star ( ss ) might be the ground state of nss @xcite .",
    "nss may convert to sss .",
    "are pulsars nss or sss ? essentially , this is a problem of non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which describes the strong interaction processes in low energy scales , and is very hard to solve in mathematics .",
    "fortunately , the astronomical observations could discriminate nss and sss , and help to understand the non - perturbative qcd issue .",
    "there are many methods to constrain the eoss of pulsars and check the differences between nss and sss .",
    "for example , sss are self - constrainted , while nss are gravity constrainted , so that they have different mass - radius relations . if we can measure the mass and radius of a pulsar , we can discriminate whether it is a ns or a ss .",
    "this has not succeeded up to now , mainly because of uncertainties of the radii .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite suggested that sax j1808.4 - 3658 may be a quark star based on this relation and available data .",
    "another constraint is the minimum mass of a pulsar or sub - millisecond pulsar . since sss are self - bounded",
    ", their mass can be much smaller than the minimum mass of ns , which could be about @xmath0 and can spin with a period shorter than 1 millisecond while a ns can not @xcite .",
    "if the mass of a pulsar is smaller than 0.1@xmath1 or the period is shorter than 1 millisecond , it could not be a ns .",
    "different eos of a pulsars gives a different maximum mass .",
    "the newly confirmed mass of psr j1614 - 2230 of 2@xmath1 @xcite rules out almost all currently proposed hyperon or boson condensate eoss @xcite and traditional soft eos of ss @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the solid quark - cluster stars ( sqs ) , a special kind of ss , could have the maximum mass to be larger than 2 @xmath1 because of the very stiff eos .",
    "the bolometric radiation of a young pulsar can be used to distinguish nss and sss , because they are different in thermal capacity and surface radiation .",
    "we note that a sqs has very small thermal capacity because its temperature is much lower than the debye temperature @xcite , it can cool down very fast and has a very lower bolometric luminosity than a ns . the missing compact object in sn1987a @xcite",
    "is studied in this paper with this luminosity constraint .",
    "there is no doubt that sn1987a provides an unprecedented opportunity in astronomy and astrophysics studies . yet",
    "the possible compact star produced in this explosion is still a mystery .",
    "on 23 february 1987 , both the kamiokande ii detector and the irvine - michigan - brookhaven detector observed a neutrino burst @xcite from the large magellanic cloud , just before the optical shine .",
    "the energy spectrum and the flux density of the neutrino burst are consistent with the current theory of core - collapse supernova with an energy release of @xmath23@xmath310@xmath4 ergs , from which a ns is expected to form therein .",
    "astronomers were excited by the possibility of watching the ns birth at the very beginning . from then on , the powerful detectors or telescopes on the ground and in the space searched it from radio to gamma ray bands , one after another .",
    "unfortunately , no pulses were detected or no point source is found there @xcite .",
    "parkes 64-m radio telescope was used to search pulses from sn1987a in the first few years at frequencies between 400 and 5000 mhz , down to the limit of @xmath20.2 mjy at 1.5 ghz @xcite .",
    "the strong efforts were made with parkes in 2006 in several bands , but no pulsar candidates with a s / n ratio greater than 9.0 were found @xcite .",
    "some optical observations announced the detection of a pulsar in sn1987a @xcite , but all of them have not been confirmed .",
    "@xcite made an optical search using the hubble space telescope .",
    "no significant pulsations were found in the period range of 0.2 ms to 10 s with an upper limit for the pulsed emission equivalent to a v magnitude of @xmath224 .",
    "a similar search was made by @xcite using the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope with similar parameters , and they got null results .",
    "@xcite obtained a luminosity limit in the 2 - 10 kev band of @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 using the xmm - newton .",
    "@xcite obtained upper limits of @xmath7 erg s@xmath6 and @xmath8 erg s@xmath6 in the same x - ray band using chandra .",
    "to explain the non - detection of the predicted ns , several possibilities were discussed .",
    "first , some of the ejected material of sn may fall back to the ns surface shortly after the supernova explosion .",
    "we can not see the ns since it has been converted to a bh due to the fall back material .",
    "but this possibility should be small .",
    "the discovery of a 2 @xmath1 pulsar @xcite suggests the maximum mass of pulsar could be much larger than 1.4 @xmath1 , and therefore a normal ns needs to accrete a lot of material for the conversion to a bh .",
    "another possibility is that the ns may be located in the cold dust cloud @xcite at the center of sn1987a , which may be opaque in some bands .",
    "but if the ns is not inside the dust or the dust is optical thin in x - ray band , it could be very intriguing because the observed upper limit at around 1 kev is already lower than the expected luminosity of a cooling ns with no heating @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the compact star at the center of sn1987a may be not a ns but a ss with a softer eos than that of neutron star matter , which could have a x - ray luminosity less than 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath6 at the age of 20 years .",
    "note that the ss of this eos is almost ruled out by the newly found 2 @xmath1 ns @xcite , because its maximum mass is smaller than 2 @xmath1 due to its soft eos .",
    "we emphasize that a model for quark star with a stiff eos , e.g. the sqs @xcite , is still survived theoretically .",
    "the sqs is suggested by @xcite and improved by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the interaction energy of quarks in a compact star could be higher than the fermi energy when the density is lower than a few tens of nuclear densities @xcite , so that quarks may be clustered and the star could be a solid star , i.e. the solid quark star ( or quark - cluster star ) .",
    "the sqs model can naturally explain most of the observational features of pulsars @xcite .",
    "the surface of sqs is self - bounded which provides a larger binding energy than the gravity - bounded ns .",
    "that is more helpful to the generation of sparks for radio emission @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission and pulsations in magnetosphere are similar to those of a ns .",
    "the star quake of sqs can induce glitches and energetic bursts which may be shown as soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite .",
    "the sqs could has a larger maximum mass than other model of quark stars .",
    "@xcite gives a maximum mass @xmath10 , which stands the test of the 2 @xmath11 pulsar @xcite .",
    "the sqs has a smaller radius than any nss when the mass is small .",
    "the newly discovery of the radius and mass of the rapid burster ( mxb 1730 - 335 ) @xcite could naturally fit the sqs model . additionally , the sqs has a very low heat capacity @xcite which helps to cool down very fast .",
    "this may explain the non - detection of a point source in sn1987a .",
    "in this work we will first analyze the cooling process of a sqs in comparison with ns and traditional liquid ss , and then further study the constraints on the parameters via heating processes of pulsars .",
    "our conclusions and discussions are presented in the last section .",
    "a stellar bh has no classical radiation , and its hawking radiation is negligible in astronomy , thus its cooling luminosity is nearly zero . for nss and sss ,",
    "the cooling processes are determined by their heat capacities and surface radiations .",
    "the heat capacities of nss , conventional sss and sqss are @xcite , @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    where the superscripts n , e , q , g-@xmath15 , and l denote the contributions of neutrons , electrons , quarks , quark - gluon plasma and lattice structure , respectively . in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are larger than @xmath18 and @xmath19 when temperature is higher than critical temperature @xmath20 ( @xmath210@xmath21 k ) .",
    "when @xmath22 the superfluid state appears , @xmath16 and @xmath17 will exponential decay and vanish quickly . in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in proportion to @xmath25 , while @xmath19 and @xmath26 are in proportion to @xmath27 . thus the heat capacity of compact stars is dominated by electrons when temperature is not too high , with @xmath2810@xmath21k for ns and ss , and @xmath210@xmath29k for sqs @xcite .",
    "the temperature will otherwise quickly cool down below @xmath30k within dozens of seconds .",
    "therefore , the heat capacity of electrons is overwhelming the cooling process in almost all observational time . the heat capacity of electrons in ns , ss and sqs are @xcite , @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 g @xmath36 , @xmath37 k , @xmath38 is the electron fraction , @xmath39 is nuclear matter density , @xmath40 is the electron number in a star , @xmath41 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath42 is the value in the star s local reference frame , and @xmath43 is the fermi energy of the degenerate electron gas . in the extremely relativistic case ,",
    "@xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number density of electrons , @xmath46 is the planck constant , and @xmath47 is the speed of light . from eq .",
    "( 6 ) we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the star radius in units of @xmath50 cm .",
    "the electron number in quark star is much smaller than that in neutron star , @xmath51 .",
    "thus the heat energy conserved in a quark star is far less than in a neutron star .",
    "surface radiation is important in the cooling process . on the ns surface ,",
    "the radiation can be simply treated as approximate black body radiation because of atomic atmosphere .",
    "on ss or sqs surface there is no atomic atmosphere , therefore the radiation mainly depends on the interaction between electric layer and photons .",
    "@xcite suggested that the surface radiation of ss is via bremsstrahlung , and predicted a luminosity smaller than @xmath52 erg s@xmath6 when it is older than 20 years . in their paper",
    "the bremsstrahlung calculations of @xcite were used .",
    "we noticed that @xcite got a much low flux of the ss bremsstrahlung emission . in our work",
    "we adopt the formula of @xcite to calculate the cooling of sqs , which makes our results more reliable .",
    "figure 1 shows the bremsstrahlung cooling curves of sqss together with those of black body radiation of the model of @xcite .",
    "we ignored neutrino radiation and color superconductivity related photon emission mechanisms .",
    "it shows that the cooling luminosity of a sqs could be smaller than @xmath52 ergs s@xmath6 about 20 years after its birth even it cools down by bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the sqs was not detected previously , when it has a larger luminosity , because of the deep x - ray optical depth @xcite and poor observation devices .",
    "thus we can conclude that if there is a cooling sqs in sn1987a it should be undetectable up to now , which is compatible with the observations .",
    "ergs s@xmath6 about 20 years after its birth even it cools down by bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "here we take the stellar mass @xmath53 and the number ratio of electron to baryon as @xmath38.,width=340 ]",
    "the bolometric luminosity of a compact star comes not only the contribution of cooling process but also heating processes from the activity of magnetosphere and the accretion from interstellar medium and accretion disks .",
    "the heating luminosity is probably lower than the upper limit of observations .",
    "the heating mechanisms are independent of the eos of pulsar , therefore we can make some constraints on the physical parameters of a possible pulsar regardless it is a ns or a sqs .    usually , the activity of magnetosphere can produce both thermal and non - thermal x - ray emissions .",
    "when particles are accelerated in the magnetosphere they can emit non - thermal x - rays with a power law spectrum . when particles flow in and bombard on the pulsar surface , they will heat it , and thermal x - rays come out from the heated area .",
    "@xcite found that the non - thermal x - ray luminosity @xmath54 and spin down energy loss rate @xmath55 are roughly related by @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite found that the thermal x - ray luminosity has a similar relation with that @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "since the observations have given a upper limit of thermal x - ray luminosity @xmath59 erg s@xmath6 @xcite , we can get an upper limit of spin energy loss rate @xmath57 .",
    "and we can further make a constraint to the parameters of spin and magnetic field of the possible pulsar , because @xmath57 is the function of spin and magnetic field , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the vertical fraction of magnetic moment @xmath63 and the spin angular frequency of the pulsar .",
    "we use a parameter @xmath64 for the factor of thermal x - ray luminosity in terms of spin down energy lost rate , i.e. @xmath65 and then we get @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the spin period of a pulsar .",
    "note that most of pulsars have an x - ray luminosity in the region of @xmath68 in both thermal and nonthermal cases @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 to get the upper left three lines in two panels of figure 2 . in the figure , the region to the left of the dash - dotted line",
    "should be ruled out because even the x - ray factor is as small as @xmath72 , it s luminosity should be larger than @xmath52 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "the region below the solid line should be compatible with observational upper limit , because the x - ray luminosity is smaller than @xmath52 erg s@xmath6 even @xmath73 .",
    "the accretion heating can also be used to restrict pulsar parameters .",
    "the accretion from interstellar medium is intensively dependent on the proper motion of a pulsar , and usually has a very small luminosity which we can ignore .",
    "here we consider only the possible accretion from the fall back disk .    to understand the evolution of the fall back disk we define three radius : the light speed radii @xmath74 , the co - rotation radius @xmath75 and the magnetosphere radius @xmath76 , as , @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the gravitational constant , the mass of pulsar and the accretion rate , respectively .",
    "in fall back disk regime a pulsar often undergoes three phases : pulse phase , propeller phase and accretion phase .",
    "the pulse phase happens in the early stage of a pulsar , when a young pulsar has a fast spin and strong radiation which pushes the interstellar medium out of the light speed radius @xmath74 , thus the compact star acts as a pulsar .",
    "when the radiation becomes not so strong , some of the medium may go into the light radius and interact with the magnetosphere .",
    "when @xmath83 or even @xmath76 is a little smaller than @xmath75 , the magnetic freezing effect would force the flow in medium to co - rotate with the pulsar , and the spin energy of a pulsar will transfer to the medium via the interaction .",
    "this is so called the propeller phase . in this phase only small amount of medium can diffuse and fall on the star surface , which induces the low luminosity x - ray emission . if the accretion material can across the co - rotation radius and access the so called break radius @xmath84 , which is a little smaller than @xmath75 ( i.e. @xmath85 ) , a massive accretion would occur .",
    "this is the accretion phase , which usually produces a very large x - ray luminosity .",
    "the hubble space telescope found dust clouds interior to the debris in sn1987a @xcite , which could be indication of the formation of a fall back disk around the centra compact star .",
    "if the fall back disk does exist , we would expect the pulsar is not in accretion phase which otherwise results in x - ray luminosity larger than @xmath52 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "thus the disk should have @xmath86 .",
    "we presume @xmath84 is proportion to @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath87 , here @xmath88 is a constant and @xmath89 . therefore to fit with the observations we need @xmath90 submitting @xmath76 and @xmath75 to the above inequation",
    ", we get the relation of the pulsar parameters , @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .     and @xmath94 , @xmath69 for red dash - dotted line , @xmath95 for red dashed line , @xmath73 for red solid line , @xmath96 erg s@xmath6 for blue solid line , @xmath97 erg s@xmath6 for blue dashed line and @xmath98 erg s@xmath6 for blue dash - dotted line .",
    "right panel : same as the left but @xmath99.,width=340 ]    the lower right three lines in both panels of figure 2 show the magnetic moment depend on the spin period with other given parameters .",
    "we presumed @xmath94 in both cases , @xmath100 for left and @xmath99 for right .",
    "we used the accretion rate from @xmath101 g s@xmath6 to @xmath102 g s@xmath6 .",
    "it should be noticed that when @xmath103 g s@xmath6 the heating luminosity can not exceed @xmath52 erg s@xmath6 even in the accretion phase . for a disk around a pulsar",
    "the accretion rate is almost impossible to exceed @xmath104 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , two kinds of heating mechanisms provide two sets of limits to the parameters of a possible pulsar , as shown in figure 2 . from the combination of both heating mechanisms ,",
    "the region between two solid lines is fine with observations , while the upper left and lower right regions are the forbidden areas . from the comparison of left panel and",
    "right panel we can see that pulsars with a smaller mass has a wider region of parameters than the massive one .",
    "because the heating mechanisms are eos independent , our results are applicable to both ns and sqs .",
    "we analyzed the cooling processes of compact stars and found that the sqss could have a thermal luminosity lower than the observational upper limit of sn1987a .",
    "we studied the possible heating processes of a young pulsar and obtained some constraints on the pulsar parameters .",
    "it should be reasonable to conclude that :    1 .",
    "a solid quark - cluster star with normal parameters is compatible with the non - detection in sn1987a , because both its cooling and heating luminosities should be lower than the observational upper limit .",
    "a low mass quark star has a wider parameter space than a massive one .",
    "if the compact star is shielded by dust , the parameter constraints should be relaxed .",
    "the parameter space of a sqs can be wider , even the object could be a normal ns .",
    "however , a black hole candidate can not be ruled out by cooling and heating analysis , though it is very difficult to form via accretion as we mentioned before .",
    "the predicted parameter space in this paper could be tested by the future observations .",
    "the impact of the supernova blast wave with its circumstellar matter is producing a ring which is visible from mm - band to x - ray band of sn1987a @xcite and it is still brightening .",
    "this ring would make it almost impossible to detect or rule out a cooling compact star in these bands .",
    "but a heating pulsar may be detected in the future because the heating luminosity from magnetospheric activity decays very slowly , and when the fall back disk evolves into the accretion phase so that the x - ray luminosity could be much larger than that in other phases and finally it could be detectable .",
    "it is not clear whether the low frequency radio and high energy @xmath15-ray bands are affected by the ring which preserves the possibility of discovering the compact star and test the parameters by the future advanced facilities , e.g. the square kilometer array ( ska ) telescope .",
