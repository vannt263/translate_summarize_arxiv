    "despite the recent extraordinary progress in observational cosmology and the successful convergence on a single cosmological model , galaxy formation and evolution largely remain an open issue .",
    "one critical aspect is how and when the present - day most massive galaxies ( e.g. elliptical galaxies and bulges with @xmath24 ) were built up and what type of evolution characterized their growth over cosmic time ( e.g. , cimatti 2004 ; glazebrook 2004 , and references therein ) . indeed ,",
    "various current renditions of the @xmath25cdm hierarchical merging paradigm differ enormously in this respect , with some models predicting the virtually complete disappearance of such galaxies by @xmath26 ( e.g. , cole 2000 ; menci 2002 ; somerville 2004a ) and other models predicting a quite mild evolution , more in line with observations ( e.g. , nagamine 2001 ; 2005 ; granato 2004 ; somerville 2004b ; a direct comparison of such models can be found in fig .",
    "9 of fontana 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , models that provide an acceptable fit to the galaxy stellar mass function at @xmath27 may differ considerably in the actual properties of the galaxies with @xmath24 at @xmath28 , with some models predicting very few , if any , passively evolving galaxies at these redshifts , at variance with recent findings ( cimatti 2004 ; mccarthy 2004 ; daddi 2005a ; saracco 2005 ) .    while various @xmath25cdm models may agree with each other at @xmath22 ( where they all are tuned ) their dramatic divergence with increasing redshift",
    "gives us powerful leverage to restrict the choice among them , thus aiding understanding of the physics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "hence , a direct observational mapping of galaxy evolution through cosmic time is particularly important and rewarding , especially if a significant number of massive galaxies at @xmath29 can be identified and studied . in this regard ,",
    "the critical questions concern the evolution with redshift of the number density of massive galaxies and their star formation histories , as reflected by their colors and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "these questions have just started to be addressed by various spectroscopy projects , such as the k20 survey ( cimatti 2002a , 52 arcmin@xmath2 ) , the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ; ferguson 2000 , 5.3 arcmin@xmath2 in the hdf - north and 4.4 arcmin@xmath2 in the hdf - south ) , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco 2004 , 320 arcmin@xmath2 in the north and south fields combined ) the hst / acs ultra deep field ( s. beckwith 2006 , in preparation ; 12 arcmin@xmath2 ) , the gemini deep deep survey ( abraham 2004 , 121 arcmin@xmath2 ) , and the extension down to @xmath30 of the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) project ( steidel 2004 , @xmath31 arcmin@xmath2 ) . however",
    ", massive galaxies are quite rare and likely highly clustered at all redshifts , and hence small areas such as those explored so far are subject to large cosmic variance ( daddi 2000 ; bell 2004 ; somerville 2004c ) .",
    "therefore , although these observation have demonstrated that old , passive and massive galaxies do exist in the field out to @xmath32 , it remains to be firmly established how their number and evolutionary properties evolve with redshift up to @xmath30 and beyond .    to make a major step forward",
    "we are undertaking fairly deep , wide - field imaging with the suprime - cam on subaru of two fields of 940 arcmin@xmath2 each for part of which near - ir data are available from eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) observations .",
    "the extensive imaging has supported the spectroscopic follow - up with the vlt and the subaru telescopes , for which part of the data have already been secured .",
    "the prime aim of this survey is to understand how and when the present - day massive galaxies formed , and to this end , the imaging observations have been optimized for the use of optical / near - ir multi - color selection criteria to identify both star - forming and passive galaxies at @xmath33 .",
    "color criteria are quite efficient in singling out high redshift galaxies .",
    "the best - known example is the dropout technique for selecting lbgs ( steidel 1996 ) . besides targeting lbgs ,",
    "color criteria have also been used to search for passively evolving galaxies at high redshifts , such as extremely red objects ( eros ) at redshifts @xmath34 ( thompson 1999 ; mccarthy 2004 ) and distant red galaxies ( drgs ) at redshifts @xmath35 ( franx 2003 ) .",
    "recently , using the highly complete spectroscopic redshift database of the k20 survey , daddi ( 2004a ) introduced a new criterion for obtaining virtually complete samples of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath36 , based on @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 band for short ] imaging : star - forming galaxies are identified requiring @xmath40 ( for convenience , we use the term  for galaxies selected in this way ) ; and passively evolving galaxies at @xmath41 requiring @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( hereafter ) .",
    "this criterion is reddening independent for star - forming galaxies in the selected redshift range , thus allowing us also to select the reddest most dust - extinguished galaxies , together with those that are old and passively evolving .",
    "this should allow for a relatively unbiased selection of @xmath19 galaxies within the magnitude limit of the samples studied .    in this paper observations ,",
    "data reduction and galaxy photometry are described , together with the first results on k - band selected samples of distant , high redshift massive galaxies .",
    "compared to optical , the near - ir selection ( in particular in the @xmath4 band ) offers several advantages , including the relative insensitivity of the k - corrections to galaxy type , even at high redshift , the less severe dust extinction effects , the weaker dependence on the instantaneous star formation activity , and a tighter correlation with the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "therefore , the study of faint galaxy samples selected in the near - infrared have long been recognized as ideal tools to study the process of mass assembly at high redshift ( broadhurst 1992 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; cimatti 2002a ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations and the data reduction .",
    "section 3 discusses the photometric calibration of the images .",
    "section 4 presents the selection and number counts for eros , , and .",
    "section 5 presents the analysis of the clustering of field galaxies , eros , , and .",
    "the properties of  are presented in section 6 .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in section 7 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the salpeter imf extending between 0.1 and 100 @xmath44 and a cosmology with @xmath45 , and @xmath46(km s@xmath47 mpc@xmath47)@xmath48 . for the sake of comparison with previous works , magnitudes and colors in both ab and vega systems have to be used . , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . ]",

    "these estimates are reduced , respectively , to @xmath231 @xmath227 yr@xmath47 mpc@xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) and 0.018 @xmath227 yr@xmath47 mpc@xmath228 ( @xmath149 ) when subtracting an estimated @xmath232 agn contamination .",

    "however , note that there appears to be just a hint for the increasing trend in sfrd with @xmath4 magnitude to flatten out at @xmath15 , indicating that a substantial contribution to the total sfrd is likely to come from @xmath235 , and therefore the values derived here should be regarded as lower limits .",

    "part of the difference is due to the absence of the reddest   from the reddy et al .",

    "[ fig : sfrdmd ] shows the differential contribution to the stellar mass density @xmath237 at @xmath225 from  and  as a function of their @xmath4-band magnitude .",
    "the open squares and triangles represent values that were calculated from all , the solid symbols represent values corrected for the agn contamination .",
    "the stars and crosses represent the mass density contributed by .",
    "the stellar mass density in deep3a - f , integrated to our @xmath84 catalog limit , is log@xmath238 @xmath227 mpc@xmath228 , in excellent agreement with the value reported in table 4 of fontana ( 2004 ) , i.e. , log@xmath239 @xmath227 mpc@xmath228 for @xmath240 galaxies , and log@xmath241 @xmath227 mpc@xmath228 for @xmath242 galaxies , but now from a much bigger sample .",
    "these estimates also agree with the log@xmath243 @xmath227 mpc@xmath228 estimate at @xmath30 by dickinson  ( 2003 ) , although their selection is much deeper ( @xmath244 ) , although it extends over a much smaller field ( hdf ) .",
    "so , while our sample is likely to miss the contribution of low - mass galaxies , the dickinson sample is likely to underestimate the contribution of high - mass galaxies due to the small field and cosmic variance .",
    "there is little evidence for flattening of log@xmath245 by @xmath7 .",
    "as already noted , the total stellar mass density at @xmath19 has to be significantly larger than that estimated here , i.e. , only from the contribution of @xmath84 @xmath8-selected galaxies .",
    "there are 121  in deep3a - f , and for @xmath31 of them we derive @xmath246 @xmath227 .",
    "correspondingly , the number density of  with @xmath246 @xmath227 over the range @xmath247 is @xmath248 mpc@xmath228 ( poisson error only ) .",
    "this compares to @xmath249 mpc@xmath228 over the same redshift range as estimated by daddi ( 2005a ) using six objects in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) with spectroscopic redshift . while the daddi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) hudf sample is important to establish that most  are indeed passively evolving galaxies at @xmath250 , their density measurements is fairly uncertain due to cosmic variance . being derived from an area which is @xmath251 times larger than hudf , the results presented here for the number density of massive , passively evolving galaxies in deep3a - f in the quoted redshift range should be much less prone to cosmic variance .",
    "hence , we estimate that , compared to the local value at @xmath22 ( @xmath252 mpc@xmath228 , baldry 2004 ) , at @xmath178 there appears to be about 20%@xmath1387% of massive ( @xmath253 ) , passively evolving galaxies , with the error above accounting also for cosmic variance .",
    "this paper presents the results of a survey based on @xmath93 photometry obtained by combining subaru optical and eso near - ir data over two separate fields ( deep3a - f and daddi - f ) .",
    "complete k - selected samples of galaxies were selected to @xmath84 in the deep3a - f over 320 arcmin@xmath2 , and to @xmath118 in the daddi - f over a field roughly twice the area .",
    "deep multicolor photometry in the @xmath254 bands were obtained for the objects in both fields .",
    "object catalogs constructed from these deep data contain more than @xmath255 objects in the nir bandpasses .",
    "galaxy @xmath4-band number counts were derived and found to be in excellent agreement with previous survey results .",
    "we have used color criteria to select candidate massive galaxies at high redshift , such as @xmath8-selected star - forming ( ) and passively evolving ( ) galaxies at @xmath9 , and eros , and derived their number counts .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 . down to the @xmath4-band limit of the survey",
    "the log of the number counts of  increases linearly with the @xmath4 magnitude , while that of  flattens out by @xmath256 . over the deep3a - f we select 387  and 121  down to @xmath7 , roughly a factor of 10 more than over the 52 arcmin@xmath2 fields of the k20 survey .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath257 higher surface density , quite possibly the result of cosmic variance . over daddi - f",
    "we select 108  and 48  down to @xmath258 .",
    "the clustering properties ( angular two - point correlation function ) of eros and @xmath8-selected galaxies ( both  and ) are very similar , and their clustering amplitudes are about a factor of 10 higher than those of generic galaxies in the same magnitude range .",
    "the most strongly clustered populations at each redshift are likely to be connected to each other in evolutionary terms , and therefore the strong clustering of eros and bzks makes quite plausible an evolutionary link between bzks at @xmath30 and eros at @xmath34 , with star formation in  subsiding by @xmath34 thus producing passively evolving eros .",
    "while some  may well experience secondary , stochastic starbursts at lower redshift , the global evolutionary trend of the galaxy population is dominated by star formation being progressively quenched in massive galaxies , with the quenching epoch of galaxies depending on environmental density , being earlier in high - density regions .",
    "\\3 . using approximate relations from daddi et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and multicolor photometry , we estimated the color excess , sfr and stellar mass of .",
    "these @xmath203 galaxies have median reddening @xmath18 , average sfr@xmath259 , and typical stellar masses @xmath260 .",
    "correlations between physical quantities are detected : the most massive galaxies are those with the largest sfrs and optical reddening @xmath182 .",
    "the high sfrs and masses of these galaxies add further support to the notion that these @xmath261 star - forming galaxies are among the precursors of @xmath262 passive eros and @xmath263 early - type galaxies .",
    "the contribution to the total star formation rate density at @xmath19 was estimated for the @xmath84  in our fields .",
    "these vigorous starbursts produce an sfrd @xmath264 @xmath227 yr@xmath47 mpc@xmath228 , which is already comparable to the global sfrd at @xmath30 as estimated from other surveys and simulations ( e.g. springel & hernqwist 2003 ; heavens et al . 2004 ) . however , a sizable additional contribution is expected from @xmath265 .    \\5 . in a similar fashion",
    ", the stellar mass of  was obtained , with the result that the number density of @xmath203  more massive than @xmath207 is about 20%@xmath1387% of that of similarly massive , early - type galaxies at @xmath221 , indicating that additional activity and subsequent quenching of star - formation in @xmath266 star - forming galaxies must account for increasing the number of massive passive galaxies by a factor of about 5 from @xmath267 .",
    "the number density of @xmath266 @xmath268s is similar to that of @xmath269s . given their strong star - formation activity , it seems that by @xmath1081.4 the full population of local @xmath266 passive galaxies could be eventually assembled as a result .",
    "this result , advocated also in daddi et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , may appear in contradiction with the recent finding by bell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) of a factor of 2 decrease in the number density of early - type galaxies at @xmath108 , with respect to the local value ( see also faber et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , our analysis of the bell et al ( 2004 ) results shows that most of this evolution is to be ascribed to the progressive disappearence with increasing redshift of the fainter galaxies , while the population of the brightest , most massive galaxies being substantially stable .",
