    "spectral and kinetic measurements are used to determine the characteristic features of the luminescence as well as the luminophors investigated . however",
    ", contrary to the spectral measurements , the kinetic measurements allows very often to give a quantitative description of the dependence investigated permitting the better determination of the mechanism of luminescence and , for example , electroluminescent device .",
    "therefore , many papers are devoted to kinetic of luminescence  @xcite .",
    "some investigators have established correlated formulas to describe the time dependence of luminescence .",
    "for example , chimczak _ et al . _",
    "( 1984 , 1995 ) described theoretically very well time dependence of zns : mn electroluminescence of thin film devices excited by short voltage pulse  @xcite . the researches ( 1989 )",
    "have also obtained good fitting of the electroluminescence to the experimental data during  @xcite as well as after the end  @xcite of rectangular exciting pulse .",

    "et al . _ have analyzed dynamics of the infrared photoluminescence in silicon powder  @xcite .",
    "all the cited above investigations allows obtaining integrated light of luminescence .",
    "however , up to now , nobody has described the integrated light , which is additional kind of investigations of luminescence kinetic .",
    "the aim of the paper is to describe the integrated light for direct excitation and energy transfer luminescence assuming monomolecular centers in the description .",
    "let assume that monomolecular luminescent centers are excited by rectangular pulse .        if direct excitation is the only process then the luminescence rises during the exciting pulse and begins to decay immediately after the end of the pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) . for monomolecular centers we have @xmath5 where @xmath6 is generation rate and @xmath7 is number of excited luminescent centers at the time @xmath8 . resolving the equation",
    "we obtain @xmath9 where @xmath10 is number of the excited centers at the end of the pulse . taking into account",
    "that for monomolecular kinetic the luminescence intensity is @xmath11 and that lifetime @xmath12 is @xmath13 we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the luminescence intensity at the end of the pulse . if we assume that , at the start , the luminescent centers were not excited than the equation @xmath16 describes luminescence intensity during the exciting pulse and equation @xmath17 describes luminescence intensity after the end of the pulse . from the equation we can get formula used to determination of luminescence lifetime @xmath18 integrated light of direct excitation luminescence during the exciting pulse , obtained from equation  ( [ eq : id ] ) , has form @xmath19 after the end of the pulse the integrated light is described as @xmath20 total integrated light of direct excitation luminescence is @xmath21",
    "in some cases , luminescence maximum appears after a time @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for very short pulse ) , considerably longer than the pulse duration @xmath24 .",
    "such behavior can be explained by assuming energy transfer between two monomolecular centers .",
    "the number of the transferring centers @xmath25 which recombine during the time @xmath26 is @xmath27 the change in the excited emitting centers is described as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . after mathematical treatments , the time dependence of the luminescence is given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the initial number of excited transferring centers and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the lifetimes of the transferring and emitting centers , respectively .",
    "the relation ( 12 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the curve in the figure attains its maximum at the time @xmath35 both the last relations are in good agreement with experimental data for electroluminescence of thin film cells based on zns : mn  @xcite .",
    "let us assume , to explain the time dependence , that each part @xmath36 of the exciting pulse @xmath24 produces the elemental curve  ( [ eq : ib ] ) ( fig .  [ fig : f3 ] )  @xcite .        after the short part @xmath36 of the exciting pulse @xmath24 , initial number of excited transferring centers is @xmath37 intensity of the luminescence , at the end of the pulse @xmath24 , produced by the part @xmath38 is @xmath39 at the end of the exciting pulse the luminescence intensity is @xmath40 in order to calculate eq .",
    "( [ eq : isum ] ) we will use @xmath41 taking into account that @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 on insertion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lim ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : isum ] ) the luminescence intensity at the end of the exciting pulse @xmath24 is given by @xmath44 if the relation  ( [ eq : ic ] ) is assumed to be valid at any time @xmath45 , the time dependence of the luminescence , during the exciting pulse @xmath24 , is described as @xmath46 this function , contrary to direct excitation luminescence , has got a point of inflection .",
    "this point appears at the same time @xmath23 , at which the first elemental luminescence curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ) excited by the first part @xmath36 of the pulse @xmath24 attains its maximum .",
    "the luminescence strongly increases with time until the time @xmath23 , when it tends to saturate .",
    "equation ( 20 ) very well describes the electroluminescence of zns : mn thin films  @xcite .    .",
    "de - direct excitation , et - energy transfer , width=283 ]    figures  [ fig : f4a ] ,  [ fig : f4b ] and  [ fig : f4c ] show relative comparison of both , direct excitation ( de ) and energy transfer ( et ) , mechanisms .",
    "the curves in these figures were plotted at @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "when the luminescence is excited by very short pulse of @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f4a ] ) , then the luminescence at the first stage of excitation is practically not seen . in the case , as is seen in the figure , there is great difference between both mechanisms .    . de - direct excitation , et - energy transfer , width=283 ]    . de - direct excitation , et - energy transfer , width=283 ]    for a longer width of the exciting pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f4b ] and  [ fig : f4c ] ) , the difference in time dependence of both mechanisms disappears .",
    "also , the difference disappears when the lifetime , @xmath33 , of the transferring centre decreases . the small difference between both mechanisms in the case of great width of the exciting pulse or short lifetime of the transferring centre are probably the reason why experimental dependences similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : f4c ] are sometimes faulty assumed to be due to direct excitation . integrated light of energy transfer luminescence during the rectangular exciting pulse , obtained from equation  ( [ eq : ict ] ) ,",
    "has form @xmath50      similar to that of sect .",
    "b , we assume that the exciting pulse consists of @xmath7 short pulses @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] )  @xcite .",
    "after exciting pulse @xmath24 by short parts d of the pulse , width=283 ]    the luminescence produced by part @xmath38 of the pulse @xmath24 is @xmath51 using the same procedure , we have got the relation describing the time dependence of luminescence after the end of the exciting pulse , for energy transfer between two monomolecular centers as @xmath52        figure  [ fig : f6 ] shows the time dependence described by the equation  ( [ eq : i3 ] ) . for short exciting pulses , the luminescence intensity at the maximum , after the end of the exciting pulse , considerably exceeds the value of the luminescence intensity at the end of the pulse .",
    "the difference is smaller for longer pulse - duration and practically absent for very long pulses .",
    "however , even in the last case , the luminescence attains its maximum , after the end of the exciting pulse , at a time @xmath53 as is seen , the time @xmath54 depends on @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath24 is going to 0 , @xmath54 is going to @xmath23 and the luminescence curve is going to that described by  ( [ eq : ib ] ) .",
    "when @xmath24 is going to infinity , @xmath54 is going to 0 and the time dependence is going to that described by  ( [ eq : ia ] ) .",
    "contrary to direct excitation , the luminescence after the end of the exciting pulse  ( [ eq : i3 ] ) also depends on @xmath24 .",
    "the equation  ( [ eq : i3 ] ) explains why the first experimental points , after the end of the exciting pulse , lie below straight line when time dependence of luminescence is plotted in semilogarithmic scale . from the  ( [ eq : i3 ] )",
    ", we obtain the integrated light of energy transfer luminescence after the end of the rectangular exciting pulse @xmath55 total integrated light of energy transfer luminescence is @xmath56",
    "time dependence of luminescence during and after a rectangular exciting pulse was discussed . in the case of direct excitation of luminescence ,",
    "the intensity of the luminescence increases during the exciting pulse and begins to decay immediately after the end of the pulse .",
    "when there is energy transfer to luminescence center from another center then the luminescence can increase in intensity after the end of the excitation pulse before subsequently decaying . during the exciting pulse",
    "the luminescence is practically not seen at the first stage of excitation .",
    "the luminescence curve has got a point of inflection at the time @xmath23  ( [ eq : tm0 ] ) .",
    "the energy transfer luminescence attains its maximum after the end of the exciting pulse at the time @xmath54  ( [ eq : tm2 ] ) . in the case of very short exciting pulses , there is a great difference between both mechanisms . for a long width of exciting pulse or very short lifetime of the transferring center",
    ", the difference disappears .",
    "it is the reason why it is sometimes faulty assumed that , for longer pulse lengths , the dominant excitation mechanism is direct excitation .",
    "it is shown in the paper , that total integrated light is proportional to the pulse length for direct excitation as well as energy transfer luminescence . from the experiment",
    ", it exhibits that , for short exciting pulses , the integrated light is not proportional to the excitation pulse length  @xcite .",
    "there is some excess in the region of short pulses .",
    "the results obtained in the paper show that the excess is not due to energy transfer mechanism .",
