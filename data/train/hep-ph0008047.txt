    "the understanding of the geometry of systems near a second order critical point is the subject of numerous recent works @xcite .",
    "most of these works consider dynamics in discrete space ( lattice ) and try to explain the formation of clusters with fractal geometry on the embedding lattice in terms of the scaling properties ( critical exponents ) of the system @xcite . in a recent work @xcite we have proposed a mechanism in order to understand the formation of the fractal clusters at @xmath0 for systems defined in a continuous space .",
    "based on a scale invariant effective action describing the dynamics at the critical point we were mainly interested in revealing how this dynamics leads to the formation of critical clusters .",
    "a general class of saddle - points of the effective action at @xmath0 turns out to dominate the configurations contributing to the partition function if we consider the statistical mechanics of an open subsystem ( cluster ) of the global critical system . in the present work we present in more detail and completeness the method used in @xcite to obtain a consistent picture of the local geometry at the transition point for one - dimensional systems and",
    "then we apply our approach in order to describe critical systems in higher dimensions .",
    "we take into account also finite - size effects and we discuss the possibility to use different functional realizations for the order parameter characterizing the system at the critical point . based on the local description of the critical system we propose an algorithm , using arguments within the framework of the mean field approximation , to construct the global system and to determine its scaling properties .",
    "the starting point in our investigation is the effective action of a thermal system at the critical point @xmath0 , specified in @xmath1 dimensions in terms of a macroscopic field @xmath2 ( order parameter ) as follows : @xmath3=g_1 \\lambda^{\\beta } \\int d^dx [ \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla_d \\phi ) ^2   + g_2 \\lambda^{\\gamma } \\vert \\lambda^{-d } \\phi \\vert ^{\\delta + 1 } ] \\label{eq : act1}\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "the distribution of @xmath16 clusters , in this picture , @xmath237 , is given by the following area - law : @xmath238 @xmath239    the smallness of the exponent @xmath240 in eqs.([eq : eq51 ] ) ( @xmath241 for @xmath242 ) guarantees that the interaction of clusters is very weak , leading to a random distribution @xmath243 in the area @xmath226 and to a poisson behaviour of the partition function , @xmath244 .",

    "the parameters of the effective theory as well as the size of the critical system , determine then the number of formed clusters , the density within each cluster and the size of each cluster .",
    "it is now straightforward to construct the global system as a set of softly interacting clusters with prescribed geometrical properties . for simplicity",
    "let us consider a system for which the order parameter is interpreted as density of particles .",
    "given the linear size @xmath40 , the isothermal critical exponent @xmath11 and the effective couplings @xmath4 , @xmath5 we calculate the size @xmath96 of a single cluster and the corresponding number of clusters @xmath245 in the system .",
    "the number of particles @xmath189 within each cluster is then given through eq.([eq : twodim ] ) .",
    "the entire net of the clusters is constructed in two steps .",
    "first we generate the positions of the centers of the clusters treating them as uniformly distributed random variables over a square with site @xmath40 .",
    "then we generate the points inside each cluster with a distribution function specified by eq.([eq : twodim ] ) .",
    "if two clusters ( say the @xmath246-th and the @xmath247-th cluster ) overlap then a point in the @xmath246-th cluster is taken into account if the nearest center to it is the center of the @xmath246-th cluster otherwise this point is neglected .",
    "such a construction is presented in fig .",
    "we have used the parameter values : @xmath248 , @xmath24 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 .    although the fractal mass dimension of each cluster is the same the resulting global set turns out to have a different fractal dimension . in fact calculating the generalized dimensions of the global set we observe that its geometric structure does not correspond to a pure monofractal set . here",
    "we have used the method of factorial moments to perform this analysis @xcite .",
    "we divide the region of the global system into @xmath251 boxes of linear size @xmath252 ( @xmath253 ) . denoting by @xmath254 the number of points within the @xmath246-th box we define the @xmath255-th order factorial moment of the distribution of the points of the global set in space as : @xmath256 for a fixed value of @xmath255 the moment @xmath257 possesses a power - law dependence on @xmath258 ( for @xmath259 ) provided that the point - set under consideration has a fractal structure : @xmath260 .",
    "the exponent @xmath261 is related to the fractal dimension of the corresponding point - set : @xmath262 .",
    "the dimensions @xmath263 are the generalized dimensions characterizing the system @xmath264 beeing the corresponding average fractal dimension . for a monofractal set the generalized dimension spectrum is given as : @xmath265 for @xmath266 .",
    "we have calculated the first three factorial moments ( @xmath267 ) as a function of @xmath258 for the set shown in fig .",
    "the results are shown in a log - log plot in fig .",
    "we find the exponents ( slopes in the log - log plot ) : @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 suggesting that the underlying set is a multifractal",
    ". a deeper understanding of the dimension spectrum of the global system based on the construction described above is a subject for a future investigation .",
    "we have studied in detail the formation of critical clusters in a wide class of systems , undergoing a thermal phase transition of second order .",
    "we have used suitable , instanton - like , saddle - point configurations for the local field - fluctuations , in order to saturate the path summation of the partition function . in this treatment",
    "we were able to describe the critical system locally and specify the geometrical properties of a single critical cluster in terms of the parameters of the effective action , at the critical point .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    1 .   in critical systems of low dimensionality @xmath271 there",
    "exist two characteristic scales @xmath272 which specify the geometry of any single critical cluster , namely its maximal size ( @xmath96 ) and its fractality region @xmath113 .",
    "the fractal dimension is @xmath273 , in agreement with other treatments on a lattice , and the minimal scale @xmath94 , below which fractality breaks down , is the analogue of the lattice spacing in any treatment in discrete space .",
    "2 .   beyond the scale @xmath96 ( @xmath91 ) the fractal dimension crosses over to smaller values , @xmath274 , and for a suitable choice of the order parameter ( @xmath180 with @xmath275 ) it may even vanish ( @xmath276 ) .",
    "therefore the scale @xmath96 can be associated with the direct correlation length , @xmath277 @xcite , which coincides with the maximal size of a single cluster .",
    "3 .   for sufficiently large systems ( size @xmath278 )",
    "the direct correlation length @xmath279 is independent of the size of the system ( fig .",
    "3 ) and remains finite even in the thermodynamic limit ( infinite system ) .",
    "4 .   the global system is built - up by a random distribution of critical clusters which may overlap giving rise to a long - range total correlation and therefore to density fluctuations at all scales .",
    "we have shown the validity of such a mechanism in 2-d by developing a suitable algorithm in order to construct the global system , based on the local description .",
    "our results show that the entire critical system develops strong density fluctuations , of multifractal nature , in a wide range of scales , far beyond the size of a single cluster ( figs .",
    ". a deeper understanding of this global structure and in particular of the connection between the fractal geometry of a single cluster and the multifractal spectrum of the entire system , remains a challenging , open question .",
    "5 .   in 3-d critical systems",
    "the anomalous dimension is approximately zero ( @xmath157 ) and the crossover scale @xmath96 associated with a single cluster coincides practically with the size of the global system ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "this observation leads to a simple picture according to which the development of fluctuations at all scales , at the critical point , is realized through the formation of self - similar clusters at all sizes .",
    "the maximum cluster size ( @xmath96 ) coincides with the size of the global system and gives a measure of the correlation length which becomes infinitely large , in the thermodynamic limit ( infinite system ) . in this case",
    "the geometry of the global system coincides with the geometry of a single cluster and therefore it remains monofractal with the same fractal dimension @xmath151 .",
    "concluding , we have investigated the geometrical structure of critical fluctuations , developed locally in a thermal system which is described effectively by a scalar field .",
    "the formation of fractal clusters with a mass dimension @xmath151 , fixed by the universality class , has been revealed and the mechanism for generating fluctuations at all scales , in the entire system , based on the local properties , has been discussed .",
    "it is of interest to note that the fluctuations of the global system obey a different geometry in 3-d critical systems ( monofractal ) and in critical systems of low dimensionality , @xmath280 ( multifractal ) .",
    "the reason for this different behaviour is due essentially to the fact that in 3-d systems , described by scalar theories , the anomalous dimension @xmath121 turns out to be very small ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "integrating the first order differential equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) we obtain : @xmath281^{1/2}}\\ ] ] it follows that : @xmath282 where : @xmath283 the integral @xmath284 can be determined analytically : @xmath285 \\label{eq : app3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath286 is the hypergeometric function .    inserting the formula @xcite : @xmath287",
