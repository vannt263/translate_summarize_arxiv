    "there have been many attempts to detect stellar activity excess / deficiency in stars hosting close - in planets ( i.e. , star ",
    "planet interaction ; spi ) , but with ambiguous results .",
    "works by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reported the detection of a significant increase of stellar activity in stars hosting hot jupiters ( hjs ) .",
    "these findings have been challenged by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who attribute those detections to biases or selection effects .    based on measurements by @xcite",
    ", @xcite discovered a significant correlation between the chromospheric activity index  of stars hosting transiting hjs and the surface gravity of their planets @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", he did not find any correlation of  with the orbital semi - major axis @xmath1 . this is the only spi correlation that has been strengthened so far by further dedicated studies @xcite .    to explain this correlation , @xcite proposed a theoretical model that assumes that the planetary material , evaporated under the action of the stellar extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation @xcite , diffuses toward the star along the magnetic field lines of the stellar corona in which the planet is embedded , to finally condense forming prominence - like structures absorbing at the core of the chromospheric resonance lines ( e.g. , h&k , h&k ) .",
    "a stronger absorption in the core of the chromospheric resonance lines , where the  index is measured , occurs when the gravity of the planet is lower , thus making the observed chromospheric emission correspondingly lower .",
    "an independent confirmation of this model comes from the detection of an anomalous lack of activity in the core of the h&k and h&k resonance lines of wasp-12 , hosting an extremely irradiated evaporating hot jupiter @xcite .",
    "this anomaly is likely caused by circumstellar absorption from material presumably lost by the planet @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the circumstellar environment in hjs systems support such a conclusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , observations have shown that atmospheric evaporation can be conspicuous and it is a key factor shaping planet structure , evolution , and circumplanetary environment for both hot jupiters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and close - in low - mass planets @xcite .",
    "a limitation of the model proposed by @xcite is that the best fit obtained when it is applied to the observations has a reduced @xmath2 remarkably greater than unity . in the present letter",
    ", we significantly improve the best fit by treating the observed sample of stars as a mixture of two different subsets with intrinsic chromospheric activity above or below the so - called vaughan  preston gap ( hereafter vp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observed for solar - like stars ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consider the sample of late - type stars with transiting planets investigated by @xcite and select the objects with effective temperature 4200@xmath3@xmath36200k , where the  index is best calibrated .",
    "we further restrict the sample to the systems with semi - major axis @xmath40.1au and @xmath5@xmath60.1@xmath7 ( @xmath5 is the planetary mass and @xmath7 jupiter s mass ) and consider only the brightest stars ( @xmath8@xmath313mag ) with a color excess @xmath30.06mag , as derived from extinction maps by @xcite , in order to reduce systematic effects caused by interstellar absorption .",
    "we excluded known multiple systems because the presence of several ( close - in ) planets may further complicate the correlations we want to investigate .",
    "jupiter - like planets are expected to have a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere , thus their evaporation is powered by the stellar euv radiation ( @xmath9912 ) .",
    "smaller planets can have instead a different atmospheric composition , possibly implying a different effective passband for the uv flux powering evaporation .",
    "it is to exclude those planets that we limit our sample to @xmath100.1@xmath7 .",
    "typical standard deviations in  are about 0.09dex @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation of the planetary gravity is computed propagating the uncertainties in the system parameters ( from exoplanets.org ) .",

    "sec : results ] ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the model proposed by @xcite assumes that the orbital motion of the planet induces a steady energy dissipation driving the host star s coronal field toward a minimum energy state characterized by mostly closed field lines that extend up to a few tens of stellar radii @xcite , within hjs orbital distance . among the possible configurations , there are some with a dip along the field lines , close to the star , where the matter evaporating from the planet can radiatively cool , condense , and be stably supported against the stellar gravity .",
    "those condensations are expected to be similar to solar prominences with a typical temperature of @xmath1110@xmath12k and an electron density of @xmath1310@xmath14@xmath15 , and absorb in the chromospheric resonance lines , notably h&k and h&k .",
    "assuming that the evaporation is powered by the stellar euv flux and that the evaporated matter diffuses along the field lines reaching the condensation site close to the star , the model predicts that @xcite @xmath16 where  is the measured chromospheric index of the star ,  is its intrinsic index ( i.e. , without any absorption by the circumstellar material ) , and the slope @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the line absorption coefficient per hydrogen atom , @xmath20 the euv stellar flux powering evaporation , @xmath21 the average heating efficiency , @xmath22 the proton mass , and @xmath23 the sound speed of the evaporating plasma .",
    "stars hosting transiting hjs are generally not biased against solar - amplitude stellar activity .",
    "we therefore expect that the  distribution follows the distribution found for solar - like stars .",
    "this can be approximated as the sum of two gaussians with mean values of about @xmath244.9 and @xmath244.5 and equal standard deviations of @xmath25dex @xcite .",
    "the former corresponds to low - activity stars and the latter to high - activity stars , i.e. below and above the vp gap , respectively .",
    "the vp gap seems not to be present at low metallicity @xcite , but our stars have about solar metallicity .",
    "we expect to find an imprint of such a bimodal distribution in eq .",

    "the excess emission @xmath29 is obtained from the measured chromospheric flux by subtracting the so - called basal flux , the minimum emission flux present for stars with a chromosphere , which for main - sequence stars should be @xmath245.1 @xcite . according to @xcite , @xmath30 ; therefore , we expect @xmath31 . by introducing the chromospheric index ,",

    "[ eq3 ] , is almost constant .",
    "the slopes of the regression lines ( eq .  [ regression ] ) computed for stars above and below the vp gap are therefore expected to be correlated to their intercepts , while the intercepts themselves are expected to be approximately @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , where we have assumed that all the other parameters entering in @xmath17 are the same for all stars .",
    "the model assumes that the condensations have a cylindrical symmetry around the axis perpendicular to the planet s orbital plane ; hence , it does not predict any dependence of the absorption on the planet s orbital phase , despite that single condensations may be discrete objects . for wasp-12",
    ", the line core absorption is indeed always present , regardless of the planet s orbital phase .",
    "our stars can not be immediately assigned to the groups above and below the vp gap because of the circumstellar / ism absorption , intrinsic variability , and statistical measurement errors .",

    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : multiplot ] clarify instead that these correlations may not be caused by spi .",
    "we find no relation between planetary and stellar mass and a weak @xmath5 correlation ; the latter does not change when considering only the most close - in planets and weakens slightly ( spearman - rank coefficient of 0.38 ) when considering planets with m@xmath870.3@xmath7 in order to avoid the biases described by @xcite .",
    "this shows that the @xmath88/@xmath5 correlation may be a consequence of the strong @xmath88 correlation . supporting this interpretation , @xcite ,",
    "using systems hosting planets discovered by radial velocity , found a weak @xmath5 correlation with a 30% significance .",
    "we find a negative @xmath88 correlation .",
    "if one considers @xmath89 or effective temperature as a proxy for stellar mass , this contrasts with what typically found for large samples of middle - aged field stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite , using a large sample of non - transiting systems , found a positive @xmath88 correlation .",
    "we argue that this difference is due to the fact that our sample of stars hosts transiting planets : condensations of planetary evaporated material would lie mostly close to the orbital plane and , on average , higher - mass stars have a higher euv flux , which leads to a higher planet evaporation rate .",
    "we find also a significant correlation between @xmath88 and @xmath1 , which is probably connected to ground - based detection biases of transiting planets : the ground - based detection probability of a planetary transit depends upon the orbital period , which is directly proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "since the orbital period of hot jupiters falls in a restricted range ( 15days ) peaking at @xmath91 days , the @xmath88@xmath1 correlation reflects the fact that the ratio @xmath92/@xmath88 has to be about constant .",
    "the @xmath1 correlation may therefore find its origin in the @xmath88@xmath1 and @xmath88 correlations .",
    "we note that these parameters are affected by various uncertainties , which may for example explain the difference in the significance between the @xmath1 and @xmath88@xmath1 correlations .",
    "we find no reason to conclude that the   correlation is caused by spi , although we are not able to exclude it completely .",
    "this conclusion is supported by results obtained from similar studies of x - ray fluxes and  values of various samples of planet hosting stars @xcite .",
    "the scenario proposed by @xcite remains therefore the most likely explanation for the ",
    "correlation and our results support it .",
    "it is left to future observations ( particularly aiming at increasing the sample of stars and further removing the systematic biases , e.g. interstellar absorption ) and modeling to support or contradict this interpretation .",
    "we found evidence of a mixture of two distributions in the correlation between the chromospheric index  and the surface gravity @xmath0 of hjs @xcite .",
    "specifically , the bic criterion and considerations on the residuals from a single linear model give a strong preference to a two - component mixture model .",
    "@xcite proposed that the @xmath0 correlation may be due to planetary evaporated material that absorbs in the chromospheric resonance lines , where  is measured , in connection to the fact that planets with a lower surface gravity have a higher evaporation rate . within this context",
    ", the two - component mixture model is naturally interpreted as a consequence of the vp gap in the distribution of the  values in late - type stars .",
    "in addition , we found that the intercepts are correlated with the slopes , as predicted by the model .",
    "we re - evaluate the role of spi in the @xmath0 correlation finding evidence favoring more the model based on the condensations of planetary evaporated material rather than spi , though the evidence is not strong enough to completely exclude it . following the model proposed by @xcite , a precise determination of the slopes @xmath17 of the two linear components would allow one to estimate the average @xmath93 ( assuming the sound speed does not vary dramatically from one system to the other ) , the effective stellar flux powering planetary evaporation , which can then be used for theoretical population and evolution studies of close - in planets . l.f . acknowledges financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation .",

    "<S> one of the possible explanations is based on the presence of condensations of planetary evaporated material located in a circumstellar cloud that absorbs the h&k and h&k resonance line emission flux , used to measure chromospheric activity . </S>",
    "<S> a larger column density in the condensations , or equivalently a stronger absorption in the chromospheric lines , is obtained when the evaporation rate of the planet is larger , which occurs for a lower gravity of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze here a sample of stars hosting transiting hot jupiters tuned in order to minimize systematic effects ( e.g. , interstellar medium absorption ) . using a mixture model , we find that the data are best fit by a two - linear - regression model . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this result in terms of the vaughan  </S>",
    "<S> preston gap . </S>",
    "<S> we use a monte carlo approach to best take into account the uncertainties , finding that the two intercepts fit the observed peaks of the distribution of  for main - sequence solar - like stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the intercepts are correlated with the slopes , as predicted by the model based on the condensations of planetary evaporated material . </S>",
    "<S> our findings bring further support to this model , although we can not firmly exclude different explanations . </S>",
    "<S> a precise determination of the slopes of the two linear components would allow one to estimate the average effective stellar flux powering planetary evaporation , which can then be used for theoretical population and evolution studies of close - in planets . </S>"
