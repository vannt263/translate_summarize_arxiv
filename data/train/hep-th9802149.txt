    "<S> a new version of the casimir effect where the two plates conduct in specific , different , directions is considered . by direct functional integration the evaluation of the casimir energy as a function of the angle between the conduction directions is reduced to quadratures . </S>",

    "<S> its independence of atomic and qed parameters reflects the perfect conductor idealization where all details are subsumed into boundary conditions @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these , in turn , quantize the @xmath3 component of the wave number vector for modes in the region between the plates , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the problem then reduces to evaluating the change in vacuum energy of all the transverse modes inside this region : @xmath5 a careful regularization of this formally divergent expression yields [ 2 ] @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the tiny casimir forces are elusive . </S>",
    "<S> past efforts [ 3 ] verified eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) rather roughly and only recently a 5% precision experiment was done [ 4 ] .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus mainly on a new variant of the casimir effect : each of the two plates conduct in a specific direction : @xmath8 for plate one and @xmath9 on plate two so that only the components @xmath10 and @xmath11 need to vanish on plates i and ii respectively , and @xmath12 is arbitrary .    </S>",
    "<S> the two polarizations contribute equally to @xmath13 . by the above  twist </S>",
    "<S> \" these polarizations can generate a controlled @xmath14 and a casimir torque , @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the casimir force can be derived also [ 5 ] by evaluating the pressure imbalance due to reflection of  vacuum modes \" off the outside surface of the plate and of the ( fewer ) internal modes off the inside surfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> if the two plates are replaced by arrays of only vertical ( or horizontal ) conducting wires ( mimicking the anisotropic conductivities ) then only the @xmath16 polarized modes will be reflected suggesting that we have half the casimir force . </S>",
    "<S> we also expect further reduction [ 6 ] of the casimir force as @xmath17 , the angle between the directions of the two sets of wires ( or the directions of conductivity in the two plates ) increases from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> we will next present an exact evaluation of @xmath20 for general @xmath17 s using an altogether different method [ 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we add to the free electromagnetic action @xmath21 a lagrange multiplier term @xmath22 ( where the last integral is only over the area - time of the plates ) . </S>",
    "<S> the functional integration over @xmath23 ensures the vanishing of the transverse electric field @xmath24 over the plates . </S>",
    "<S> since we want the @xmath25 field to vanish only up to gauge transformations we integrate only over conserved currents @xmath26 . also since only transverse components of @xmath27 have to vanish we allow @xmath26 to have components only in the three - dimensional area - time of the plates i.e. @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we will write for the partition function @xmath29 the only difference in the case of interest , where each plate conducts in a specific direction , is that only one component of @xmath24 has to vanish on each plate . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by further restricting the allowed currents @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> hence eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) and its consequences remain correct as long as we remember to interpret @xmath30 differently . changing the order of integration and doing first the standard @xmath31 integration yields : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the massless feynman propagator [ 8 ] </S>",
    "<S> ( constant s coefficients such as the @xmath34 above contribute only an overall multiplicative factor or an additive term to the energy and will be discarded henceforth ) . denoting the currents on the first and second plates by @xmath35 and @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> , we have the more explicit expression for @xmath37 : @xmath38 or after a wick rotation @xmath39 where we think of @xmath40 as of ordinary 3-vectors in ordinary 3-dimensional euclidean space ( although it is actually spanned by @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> fourier transforming in @xmath42 this becomes : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and we used translation invariance . in the usual case of two conducting plates both @xmath45 and @xmath46 have two transverse degrees of freedom fixed by the current conservation condition : @xmath47 . in the case of specific conduction directions , @xmath45 , and </S>",
    "<S> likewise @xmath46 , have only one allowed non - zero component determined by current conservation and by the demand that its spatial part @xmath48 is along the direction of conduction . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote the cosine of the angle between the directions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 by @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 an ordinary euclidean vector ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we can write for @xmath37 : @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are scalars and the reality of @xmath55 implies : @xmath56^ * = j_i(-\\vec k)\\ ] ]    since the action is quadratic , @xmath37 is given by the corresponding determinant which is just the product of the two - dimensional determinants corresponding to the various value of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath58 @xmath59 where the area - time @xmath60 came from density of states factor [ 9 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it corresponds to having @xmath61 the usual quantization of continuous modes in a box of volume @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the last integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 11 ) is well defined and convergent . to obtain it , we discarded the infinite @xmath63 term which does not depend on @xmath1 or the angle @xmath17 between the directions of conductivity in the two plates and hence does not contribute to casimir forces / torque [ 9 ] . identifying @xmath64 we get finally : @xmath65 or using integration by parts ( with respect to @xmath66 after separating @xmath67 ) : @xmath68 where in the last step we multiplied numerator and denominator by @xmath69 and changed variables @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next find an explicit expression for @xmath71 . to this end , let us denote by @xmath72 the two unit vectors in the planes of plates and perpendicular to the direction of conduction in the first and second plate respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the direction @xmath73 is then determined by the conditions @xmath74 . hence @xmath75 choosing @xmath76 and using polar coordinates decomposition of @xmath66 : @xmath77 we find @xmath78 ^ 2 } { ( 1-\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\varphi)(1-\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2(\\varphi-\\beta))}\\ ] ] for @xmath79 the integral can be calculated analytically @xmath80 in this case @xmath81 and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) yields @xmath82 this is exactly half the usual casimir energy , as expected since only one polarization contributes providing a nice check of the calculation .    for general @xmath17 numerical integration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) yields @xmath83 as plotted in fig </S>",
    "<S> . 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.0 cm    in addition to the @xmath17 dependent @xmath84 , @xmath85 is a casimir torque tending to align the plates so that @xmath79 , i.e. parallel conductivity directions and minimal energy are achieved . </S>",
    "<S> since torques are easier to measure , @xmath86 could perhaps be tested to a better accuracy than @xmath87 or @xmath88 though extreme , global , flatness will be required to avoid friction due to microscopic roughness , as the circular plates rotate relative to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that for non - circular plates , or when we have broad conducting stripes , another aligning torque results from the preference to have maximal adjacent plate area . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this trivial geometrical effect is not the subject of interest here . </S>",
    "<S> the following comments are in order :    \\(i ) the mode sum / integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) involved in the usual derivation is very different from that in the present derivation . in particular , beyond our discarding of the @xmath89 independent infinite part in the last step of eq . ( </S>",
    "<S> 11 ) , no regularization is required here . also extending the standard method to derive </S>",
    "<S> our result for @xmath90 , seems rather difficult .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) the only relevant distance in this problem is the space - like plate separation involved here . </S>",
    "<S> this problem as well as any other static casimir calculation can therefore be done directly by the euclidean path integral with @xmath91 and no wick rotation is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) the present method was applied also to other geometries ( spherical , cylindrical , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> the known casimir energies were retrieved though not with extra ease or rigor .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iv ) for the case of two magnetic / electric polarizable objects much smaller than their separation the present formalism readily yields the usual casimir  </S>",
    "<S> polder result for the potential between polarizable atoms [ 10 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(v ) finite temperature can be easily incorporated into the present approach , by replacing the @xmath92 integration in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) by a discrete sum . </S>",
    "<S> we can also generalize to the case of @xmath93 dimensions , by replacing @xmath94 there by @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(vi ) the present approach can be readily generalized to time dependent boundary condition . as noted also by golestanian and kardar ( see ref . 7 above ) </S>",
    "<S> , this can result in  casimir radiation \" . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that the lowest order ( two - photon amplitude is simply given by @xmath96\\ ] ] with @xmath97 the polarizability of a neutral and small ( relative to @xmath98 ) object which moves along a trajectory @xmath99 with @xmath100 the proper time .    </S>",
    "<S> all of the points ( iii)-(iv ) will be elaborated in a longer paper by o. kenneth .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the main theme of this letter , we note that the naive argument of ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) that @xmath101 should vanish [ due to the fact that for two arrays of orthogonal wires , the @xmath102 polarized modes are free to escape from the left , say , and the @xmath103 polarized modes from the right ] fails . as indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , this is definitely not the case . </S>",
    "<S> indeed one simple approach views the ordinary attractive casimir effect as the attraction between patches of charges formed on one plate by charge separation due to quantum fluctuations and patches of opposite sign ,  image \" , charges induced on the other plate . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this mechanism can operate , albeit with reduced strength , even if the two plates are made of conducting stripes pointing in orthogonal directions .    </S>",
    "<S> this brings us to the final subject that we would like to mention , namely , an analog interpretation of magnetic casimir attraction between two conducting rings .    </S>",
    "<S> consider then two parallel conducting rings of size @xmath1 and at a distance @xmath1 apart . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic vacuum fluctuations include closed b field lines which link both rings . </S>",
    "<S> these will induce , by faraday s law , parallel currents in the two rings . </S>",
    "<S> thus , regardless of the sign of the b fluctuation and of the ensuing circulating current , the resulting current current forces will be attractive [ 12 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations of interest are of scale @xmath104 when the above current - current forces on the various segments of the rings add coherently corresponding to the net current flow in the rings @xmath105 . if there is no net global flux change in the rings due to the vacuum fluctuation there will be - in this approximation - no net current and no net force </S>",
    "<S> .    how will this force be modified if the rings become superconducting ?    ideally , the superconducting rings impose a new integral constraint , namely that the total fluxes threading the various superconducting rings must be integer multiples of the flux quantum : @xmath106 .    </S>",
    "<S> this implies however a strong exponential suppression . </S>",
    "<S> thus if we have a fluctuation with roughly constant @xmath107 on scale @xmath1 :    @xmath108    the action of such a configuration will therefore be :    @xmath109    the exponential suppression @xmath110   \\approx \\exp\\left[-\\frac{n^{2}}{\\alpha_{em}}\\right]$ ] renders such fluctuation and the attendant magnetic casimir forces completely negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> the above considerations suggest that if the casimir force between conducting rings is constantly monitored as the temperature of the system is lowered below the superconducting critical temperature , then the quenching of part of the magnetic casimir force reduces the observed effect . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully , this amusing effect can eventually be observed , but we will not elaborate here on the conditions necessary for this . </S>"
