    "the most challenging problems for applying the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) to exclusive processes have long been discussed and analyzed in many papers , such as the pqcd applicability to the exclusive processes at experimentally accessible energy region due to the end - point singularity ; to estimate the contributions from power corrections , which includes higher order in @xmath4 , higher helicities , higher twists in distribution amplitude ( da ) , higher fock states and etc . ; to estimate the uncertainties from perturbatively incalculable das .",
    "the pion form factor can be obtained through the definition @xmath5 where @xmath6 , with the quark flavor @xmath7 and the relevant electric charge @xmath8 , is the vector current .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath9 is restricted in the space - like region .",
    "the pqcd applicability to the pion form factor at the experimentally accessible energy region has been raised by ref.@xcite and attracted much attention for many years . in the modified pqcd approach that is proposed in ref.@xcite , i.e. the transverse momentum dependence ( @xmath10 dependence ) as well as the sudakov corrections",
    "are taken into account in the calculations , we have the following factorization formula@xcite , @xmath11_{n}[dy_jd{\\bf l}_{\\perp j}]_{m } \\psi_{n}(x_i,{\\bf k}_{\\perp i};\\mu_f)t_{n m}(x_i,{\\bf k}_{\\perp i};y_j,{\\bf l}_{\\perp j};\\mu_f)\\psi_{m}(y_j,{\\bf l}_{\\perp j};\\mu_f),\\ ] ] where @xmath12_n$ ] is the relativistic measure within the @xmath13-particle sector , @xmath14 extend over the low momentum states only and @xmath15 are the partonic matrix elements of the effective current operator . here the helicity states of the pion are implied in both sides .",
    "the dependence on the scale separating low ( non - perturbative ) and high momenta ( perturbative ) is indicated by @xmath16 . for the valence quark state of the pion ,",
    "its light cone ( lc ) wave functions are defined in terms of the bilocal operator matrix element@xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the pion decay constant , whose experimental value is @xmath20@xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is the leading twist ( twist-2 ) wave function , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are sub - leading twist ( twist-3 ) wave functions that correspond to the pseudo - scalar structure and the pseudo - tensor structure respectively@xcite .",
    "the distribution amplitude @xmath24 and the wave function @xmath25 are related by @xmath26    it has been shown in different approaches@xcite that applying pqcd to the pion form factor begins to be self - consistent for a momentum transfer at about @xmath27 .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the pion form factor at large momentum transfer has also been analyzed@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite presents a complete nlo pqcd prediction for the pion form factor and it shows that a reliable pqcd prediction can be made at a momentum transfer around @xmath28 with corrections to the lo results being up to @xmath29 . the theoretical uncertainty related to the renormalization scale ambiguity has been estimated to be less than @xmath30 and for all the considered das , concerning the choices of the renormalization schemes and the factorization scales , the ratio of the nlo to the lo contribution to the pion form factor @xmath31 is greater than @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "a detailed calculation about the higher helicity components contributions to the hard part and the soft part of the pion form factor within the lc pqcd approach was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "their results show that by fully keeping the transverse momentum dependence in the hard part , the asymptotic behavior of the hard scattering amplitude from the higher helicity components is of order @xmath34 , but it can give a sizable contribution to the pion form factor at the present experimentally accessible energy region .",
    "other power corrections are from the higher twist structures in the pion da . in the literature , based on the asymptotic behavior of the twist-3 das , especially @xmath35 ,",
    "most of calculations give large twist-3 contributions@xcite , i.e. the twist-3 contribution to the pion form factor is comparable or even larger than that of the leading twist in a wide intermediate energy region , e.g. @xmath36 .",
    "it is hard to believe these results are reliable , since the power suppressed corrections make such a large contribution up to @xmath37 .",
    "however , because the end - point singularity becomes more serious , the calculations for these higher twist contributions have more uncertainty than that for the leading twist .",
    "in fact , one may find that such kind of large contribution comes mainly from the end - point region and is model dependent .",
    "it means that one should try to look for a reasonable twist-3 wave function with a better behavior in the end - point region than that of the asymptotic one , and the twist-3 contribution might be less important and less uncertainty .",
    "recently in ref.@xcite , based on the moment calculation , the authors obtained a new form for @xmath38 , which has a better behavior at the end - point region than that of the asymptotic one .",
    "their approach is different from that of refs.@xcite , i.e. they did not apply the equation of motion for the quarks in the hadron and determined the coefficients of the gegenbauer polynomial expansions directly from the da moments obtained in the qcd sum rules .",
    "the @xmath38 obtained in ref.@xcite can be used to suppress the end - point singularity coming from the hard scattering kernel . in this paper , we will develop it to construct a model wave function @xmath22 and apply it to calculate the twist-3 contributions to the pion form factor .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we construct a model for the pionic twist-3 wave function @xmath22 with the help of the moment calculation in ref.@xcite . and in sec.iii",
    ", the twist-3 contribution to the pion form factor , including those coming from the higher helicity components , will be studied within the modified pqcd approach . in sec.iv",
    ", we discuss the model dependence for the twist-3 contribution .",
    "finally we summarize our results and give the combined hard contributions to the pion form factor in sec.v .",
    "for the twist-3 das , since the asymptotic behavior of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , one may observe that the end - point singularity comes more seriously from @xmath38 than from @xmath39 . with @xmath39 in the asymptotic form",
    ", the end - point singularity coming from the hard scattering kernel can be cured , while the asymptotic behavior of @xmath38 can not suppress such kind of end - point singularity .",
    "the pion twist-3 das have been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "they employed the conformal symmetry and the equations of motion of the on - shell quarks within the hadron to get the relations among the two - particle twist-3 das , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( here and hereafter @xmath44 ) , and the three - particle twist-3 da @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the corresponding constituent in the three - particle state ( higher fock state , e.g. @xmath48 ) of the pion and satisfies @xmath49 ) .",
    "then they took the moments of @xmath45 to obtain the approximate forms for the two - particle twist-3 das .",
    "however as has been argued in ref.@xcite , since the quarks are not on - shell , it is questionable to use the equation of motion .",
    "so ref.@xcite suggested to calculate the moments of the pion two - particle twist-3 das directly from the qcd sum rules .    under the approximation that the lowest pole dominate and the higher dimension condensates are negligible , the sum rule for the moments of @xmath42 can be written as@xcite , @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is",
    "the borel parameter and @xmath52 is the moment of @xmath42 , which is defined by @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 in eq.([moms ] ) should be chosen to make the moments and the parameter @xmath55 most stable against @xmath56 in a certain range . in eq.([moms ] ) , one may observe that the usual @xmath57-dependence in the sum rule for the moments of @xmath42@xcite has been replaced by an undetermined parameter @xmath55 . with the help of eq.([moms ] ) , setting @xmath58 and varying the borel parameter @xmath51 in a reasonable range , we can obtain the values for the moments that are necessary to fit the parameters for our model wave function .",
    "now we construct a model wave function @xmath59 of the twist-3 part that is related to @xmath38 by the definition eq.([phipsi ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic transverse momentum dependence is determined by the non - perturbative dynamics and at present we can not solve it .",
    "ref.@xcite suggested a connection between the equal - time wave function @xmath60 in the rest frame and the lc wave function @xmath61 in the infinite momentum frame , i.e. @xmath62 which expressed that the lc wave function should be a function of the bound state off - shell energy .",
    "eq.([bhleq ] ) is the so called bhl prescription@xcite .",
    "recently , some improvements on the transverse momentum dependence of the wave function have been given in ref.@xcite , which presents a systematic study of the b meson lc wave function in the heavy - quark limit and by applying the qcd equations of motion .",
    "their results show that under the wandzura - wilczek approximation @xcite , the transverse and the longitudinal momenta in the b meson wave function are correlated through the combination @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , roughly speaking , is the longitudinal momentum of the light quark in b meson and @xmath65 is the  effective mass \" of b meson in the heavy quark effective theory . ] . by adopting the above prescription eq.([bhleq ] ) and by using the harmonic oscillator model in the rest frame ,",
    "the transverse momentum dependence part , @xmath66 , can be written as@xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the quark mass and the harmonic parameter , respectively . combining it with the new form of @xmath42 , which is in the gegenbauer polynomial expansion@xcite",
    ", one can construct a model wave function with @xmath10 dependence , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are gegenbauer polynomials and the coefficients @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be determined by the da moments . in eq.([hel0wave ] ) , only the first three terms in the gegenbauer polynomial expansions have been considered .",
    "since the higher moments of @xmath42 obtained from the sum rule ( eq.([moms ] ) ) depends heavily on the borel parameters , it is unreliable to do further expansions , so we only take the first three moments which have a better confidence level for our discussion . the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be taken from assuming the same @xmath10 dependence as the twist-2 wave function , and here we take@xcite @xmath76 which are derived for @xmath77 . from the model wave function eq.([hel0wave ] ) , we obtain @xmath78 reasonable ranges for the @xmath42 moments have been given in ref.@xcite by applying the qcd sum rules ( eq.([moms ] ) ) , i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath80 . here",
    "we take @xmath81 for our latter discussion .",
    "the parameters in the wave function can then be determined as , @xmath82 as is shown in fig.([wavep1 ] ) , the shape of the present da for @xmath42 is very close to the one that is proposed in ref.@xcite .    in the model wave function",
    "defined in eq.([hel0wave ] ) , only the usual helicity components @xmath83 have been taken into account , while the higher helicity components @xmath84 which come from the spin - space wigner rotation have not been considered . as has been pointed out in refs.@xcite",
    ", there is a large suppression coming from the higher helicity components in the leading twist wave function , and one may expect that the higher helicity components in the higher twist wave functions also will do some contributions to the pion form factor .",
    "so we need to consider the higher helicity components in the twist-3 wave function .",
    "the full form for the lc wave function , i.e. @xmath85 , which includes all the helicity components , can be found in the appendix . from @xmath85",
    ", one may directly find that its da @xmath86 is almost coincide with @xmath42 and for simplicity , we can take the approximate relation , @xmath87 .    .",

    "one may observe that the possible end - point singularity coming from the hard scattering kernel will be suppressed in our da and the twist-3 contribution can be greatly suppressed at the present experimentally accessible energy region .",
    "in the large @xmath88 region , by considering only the lowest valence quark state of the pion ( i.e. @xmath89 in eq.([pikt ] ) ) and by doing the fourier transformation of the wave function with the formula , @xmath90 we can transform the pion form factor eq.([pikt ] ) into the compact parameter @xmath91 space@xcite , @xmath92[dy_jd{\\bf h } ] \\hat{\\psi}(x_i,{\\bf b};\\mu_f)\\hat{t}(x_i,{\\bf b};y_j,{\\bf h};\\mu_f)\\hat{\\psi}(y_j,{\\bf h};\\mu_f ) \\times s_t(x_i)s_t(y_j)\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\exp(-s(x_i , y_j , q,\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{h};\\mu_f)),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 , @xmath94=dx_1dx_2d^2\\mathbf{b } \\delta(1-x_1-x_2)/(16\\pi^3)$ ] and the hard kernel @xmath95 the factor @xmath96 contains the sudakov logarithmic corrections and the renormalization group evolution effects of both the wave functions and the hard scattering amplitude , @xmath97,\\ ] ] where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the sudakov exponent factor , whose explicit form up to next - to - leading log approximation can be found in ref.@xcite . in eq.([twistpion ] ) , @xmath101 and @xmath102 come from the threshold resummation effects and the exact form of each involves one parameter integration@xcite . in order to simplify the numerical calculations ,",

    "<S> our results show that the twist-3 contribution drops fast and it becomes less than the twist-2 contribution at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the higher helicity components in the twist-3 wave function will give an extra suppression to the pion form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the model dependence of the twist-3 contribution to the pion form factor has been studied by comparing four different models . </S>",
