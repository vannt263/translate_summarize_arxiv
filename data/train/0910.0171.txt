    "the model of a crystal of point - like charges immersed in a uniform neutralizing background of opposite charge was conceived by wigner @xcite to describe a possible crystallization of electrons .",
    "these wigner crystals of electrons have much in common with coulomb crystals of ions with the uniform electron background .",
    "the model of the coulomb crystal is widely used in different branches of physics , including theory of plasma oscillations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , solid state physics , and works on dusty plasmas and ion plasmas in penning traps ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , coulomb crystals of ions , immersed in an almost uniform electron background , are formed in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron stars .",
    "the properties of such crystals are important for the structure and evolution of these astrophysical objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the coulomb crystal heat capacity @xcite controls cooling of old white dwarfs and is used to determine their ages ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "crystallization of white dwarfs can influence their pulsation frequencies .",
    "it can thus be studied by powerful methods of asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "microscopic properties of coulomb crystals determine the efficiency of electron - phonon scattering in white dwarfs and neutron stars , and , hence , transport properties of their matter ( such as electron thermal and electric conductivities , and shear viscosity , e.g. , @xcite ) as well as the neutrino emission in the electron - ion bremsstrahlung process @xcite .",
    "many - body ion correlations in dense matter produce screening of ion - ion ( nucleus - nucleus ) coulomb interaction and affect nuclear reaction rates in the thermonuclear burning regime with strong plasma screening and in the pycnonuclear burning regime ( when the reacting nuclei penetrate through the coulomb barrier owing to zero - point vibrations in crystalline lattice ) .",
    "the description of various nuclear burning regimes and observational manifestations of burning in white dwarfs and neutron stars are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the manifestations include type ia supernova explosions of massive accreting white dwarfs , bursts and superbursts , deep crustal heating of accreted matter in neutron stars .    since the late 1990s certain astrophysical applications have been requiring a comprehensive study of coulomb crystals in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the topic has become important due to the growing observational evidence that some very intriguing astrophysical objects , soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars , belong to the same class of sources called magnetars ( see , e.g. , @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "these are thought to be isolated , sufficiently warm neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields",
    "@xmath0  g. for instance , the magnetic field of sgr 180620 , inferred from measurements of its spin - down rate , is @xmath1 g @xcite .",
    "magnetars are observed in all ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "they show powerful quasipersistent x - ray emission , bursts and giant bursts with enormous energy release . during giant bursts",
    ", one often observes quasi - periodic x - ray oscillations which are interpreted ( e.g. , @xcite ) as vibrations of neutron stars ( involving torsion vibrations of crystalline neutron star crust ) .",
    "it is likely that the activity of magnetars is powered by their superstrong magnetic fields .",
    "thus the magnetars can be viewed as natural laboratories of dense matter in magnetic fields . in order to build adequate models of magnetar envelopes and interpret numerous observations , it is crucial to know the properties of magnetized coulomb crystals .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study in detail coulomb crystals in an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "( the results reported here were partially presented in @xcite . )",
    "the coulomb crystals in question consist of fully ionized ions with charge @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 arranged in a crystal lattice and immersed into the rigid electron background ( in this case , rigid means unpolarizable or incompressible , i.e.  constant and uniform ) .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field @xmath4 on the ion motion can be characterized by the ratio @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the ion cyclotron frequency and the ion plasma frequency , respectively ; @xmath7 is the ion number density , while @xmath8 is the speed of light .",
    "it is expected that the magnetic field modifies the properties of the ion crystal at @xmath9 ( see , however , figs.[b - c ] and [ u1um1 ] below ) . in a strong magnetic field",
    "the approximation of rigid electron background is a bigger idealization of the real situation in neutron star crust matter , since higher densities are required to achieve full ionization and suppress the polarizability of the electron background",
    ". the higher densities ( and @xmath10 ) imply smaller @xmath11 .",
    "however , the effective ion charge approximation turns out to be successful for analyzing partially ionized systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 ( also equal to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath14 being the mass density ) is , actually , independent of the ion charge .",
    "hence , one can consider large @xmath11 in coulomb crystals at not too high densities having in mind the effective ion charge approximation . despite that",
    ", the effect of the polarizability of the compensating electron background has to be studied separately .",
    "the closely related problem of magnetized wigner crystals of electrons was studied in the early 1980s by usov , grebenschikov and ulinich @xcite and by nagai and fukuyama @xcite .",
    "usov et al .",
    "@xcite obtained the equations for crystal oscillation modes , studied qualitatively the oscillation spectrum , and diagonalized the hamiltonian of the crystal for a proper quantum description of the oscillations in terms of phonons .",
    "in addition , the authors investigated asymptotic temperature and magnetic field dependences of the specific heat , rms electron displacement from the respetive lattice site , and magnetic moment of the crystal .",
    "they obtained a soft phonon mode with the frequency @xmath15 near the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "it resulted in a rather unusual low - temperature specific heat behavior ( @xmath16 ) instead of the standard debye law ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "also , the authors mentioned the dependence of the crystal energy on the magnetic field direction as well as the increased stability of the crystal due to a suppression of electron vibration amplitudes .",
    "in addition , usov et al .",
    "@xcite considered the dielectric function of the crystal and studied the effect of the electromagnetic field induced by the electron motion .",
    "their main results were , however , of semi - qualitative nature , limited to various extreme cases , whereas the present paper focuses mostly on quantitative results , pertaining to coulomb crystals of ions , with an eye to astrophysical implications .",
    "nagai and fukuyama @xcite calculated phonon spectra of magnetized body - centered cubic and face - centered cubic ( bcc and fcc ) wigner crystals and compared the energies of these crystals at zero temperature as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the crystal energy was calculated as a sum of the electrostatic ( madelung ) energy , and the zero - point energy of crystal vibrations .",
    "the effect of the anharmonic and exchange terms was neglected .",
    "the electrostatic energy is independent of the magnetic field ( as long as the field does not alter the lattice structure ) .",
    "the vibration energy does depend on the field because the field modifies phonon modes . at zero field",
    "the energy minimum is realized by the bcc structure , both with and without zero - point vibrations ( in general , it is not true for polarizable background , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the authors showed that for a sufficiently strong magnetic field and at relatively high densities [ @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the standard density parameter , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the bohr radius , @xmath22 being the electron number density ] the full energy is minimized by the fcc structure . it is worth mentioning that the authors did not consider the dependence of the zero - point energy on the magnetic field direction and performed all calculations for a fixed direction ( along one of the high symmetry axes of the crystals ) .",
    "however , this choice of the field direction for the bcc lattice was not optimum , as far as the lattice energy was concerned .",
    "moreover , the energy gain obtained by choosing the optimum direction is of the same order of magnitude as the difference between the zero - point energies of bcc and fcc lattices .",
    "nagai and fukuyama @xcite investigated an analogous structural transition between bcc and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) electron wigner lattices .",
    "the hcp lattice was found energetically favorable for a sufficiently strong magnetic field at @xmath23 .",
    "this result seems more robust since the energy difference between bcc and hcp lattices is several times larger than the energy gain obtained by choosing the optimum direction of the magnetic field in the bcc lattice ( the field direction adopted in @xcite was the same as in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , nagai and fukuyama @xcite described the behavior of all 6 phonon modes of the hcp lattice in the magnetic field .",
    "also , they analyzed quantitatively the behavior of transverse and longitudinal electron displacements from the equilibrium positions for bcc and hcp lattices ( at zero temperature ) and concluded ( qualitatively ) that in strong magnetic fields the crystals became significantly more stable in the transverse direction and somewhat more stable in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ eqs ] discusses equations for coulomb crystal oscillations in the magnetic field .",
    "section [ spectrum ] focuses on the phonon spectrum of such a crystal with a simple lattice ( i.e. , one ion in the primitive cell ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized in sec.[diag ] , which allows one to express the ion displacement operator via phonon creation and annihilation operators .",

    "[ crust_ex ] these results are applied to the real physical system found in magnetar crust .",

    "the results will be parameterized by the quantum parameter @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are temperature and ion plasma temperature , respectively ) , and by the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath27 . in this case , @xmath28 is the ion sphere radius .",
