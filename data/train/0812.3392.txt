    "recently , there have been several studies of the milky way s magnetic field by the means of observing the rotation measure of compact polarized objects like extra - galactic point sources ( e.g. @xcite ) or pulsars ( see talks by a. noutsos and j .- l .",
    "however , we still do not know the large - scale magnetic field configuration or even the number of field reversals within our galaxy .",
    "one problem is that through faraday rotation studies of extra - galactic point sources we only derive the average magnetic field parallel to the line of sight @xmath0 through our galaxy weighted by the electron density @xmath1 , because the rotation measure @xmath2 is given by : @xmath3 here @xmath2 is given in rad / m@xmath4 , @xmath5 in @xmath6 g , @xmath1 in @xmath7 , and the pathlength @xmath8 in pc .",
    "in addition extragalactic sources may suffer from intrinsic faraday rotation of unknown magnitude .",
    "faraday rotation studies of pulsars average @xmath0 between us and the pulsar weighted by @xmath1 .",
    "in addition pulsars distances are usually quite uncertain and pulsars probe only a very small area in space since they are only about 15 km in diameter .",
    "one big problem of the averaging procedure is that there could be numerous field reversals along the line of sight , which would be averaged out .",
    "this ambiguity could be solved if we had anchor points for the magnetic field within our galaxy .",
    "we propose to determine these anchor points with polarization and faraday rotation studies of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , since these can be used as magnifying glasses of their ambient magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the supernova remnants are adiabatically expanding into an ambient medium of constant density @xmath9 and constant homogenous magnetic field @xmath10 . in our model",
    "the snr is circular and has a shell with a width of about 10% of the snr s radius in which the ambient medium and its magnetic field are compressed by a factor of 4 . while the electron density in the shell is assumed to be constant the magnetic field changes with the angle between the snr s expansion direction and the ambient magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "it is proportional to the `` number '' of magnetic field lines , which are swept up by the expanding shock wave , hence the magnetic field inside the shell is strongest where the snr is expanding perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field and 0 , where it is parallel .",
    "the synchrotron emission is integrated along the line of sight from the back of the snr to the front and appropriately faraday rotated ( see equation  [ rm ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron flux density @xmath11 produced by a spectrum of relativistic electrons @xmath12 at frequency @xmath13 is given by : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the energy and the values for @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined by @xmath12 .",
    "( from top to bottom : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21).,width=491 ]    in fig .",
    "[ model ] we display the simulated emission structure in total intensity and polarized intensity and the internal rotation measure that would be observed from a typical supernova remnant at different viewing angles @xmath22 . in this simulation",
    "the ambient magnetic field is pointing away from us from the front left to the back right and @xmath22 is the angle between the plane of the sky and the magnetic field lines the snr is expanding into . for negative @xmath22 here , the magnetic field would point towards us from the back left to the front right . in the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] the ambient magnetic field is @xmath23 g , the ambient density is 1@xmath7 , the distance of the snr is 2kpc , and its diameter is 20pc .",
    "the simulation was convolved to a resolution of 2.5.    in emission we find the typical bilateral structure of snrs in total power and polarized intensity with a tangential magnetic field up to a @xmath22 of about @xmath20 , beyond which the snr becomes circular and thick - shelled with a radial magnetic field .",
    "the surface brightness of the snr is decreasing form @xmath18 to @xmath24 by a factor of almost 10 .",
    "the rotation measure structure reveals a few very interesting characteristics .",
    "the internal rotation measure in the centre of the snr is always 0 , which indicates that from observations we can determine the foreground @xmath2 there .",
    "the entire snr except for @xmath18 is dominated by rm of one sign ; in fig .  [ model ] it is mostly negative .",
    "this indicates whether the ambient magnetic field is pointing away from us or towards us .",
    "there is also a smaller area of opposite sign .",
    "its location indicates the orientation of the ambient magnetic field and its distance from the centre gives an approximate value for @xmath22 .",
    "in addition we find that the rm on the two arcs shows a linear behaviour up to about @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ grad ] ) .",
    "this can be described by its gradient , which depends entirely on @xmath26 and the size of the snr and is almost independent of @xmath22 and the @xmath2 in the middle , which is determined from @xmath22 and the foreground @xmath2 . to show how we can exploit these characteristics",
    "we will give two examples .",
    "in fig .  [ da530 ] we display a polarized intensity and rotation measure map of the snr da530 , which is located high above the galactic plane at a latitude of about @xmath27 .",
    "the overlaid vectors in the polarized intensity image indicate a tangential magnetic field , which we expected from the simulations for a snr with a @xmath22 of less than @xmath20 .",
    "the rotation measure in the centre is about 0rad / m@xmath4 , hence we can neglect foreground effects .",
    "the rm map is dominated by negative rotation measures , but there is a small area of positive rm to the left of the centre .",
    "this indicates that the snr is expanding into a magnetic field , which is pointing away from the front left to the back right .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ da530 ] the rm values on both shells differ significantly , however , the gradient seems to be the same .",
    "this implies that the ambient density and magnetic field strength are the same for both shells",
    ". the difference could be either in the foreground rm or the ambient magnetic fields for the two shells have a different @xmath22 . to find such a large difference in rotation measure on such a small scale in the foreground is very unlikely , since it would require either another snr or an hii region in the foreground to produce such a large effect",
    "both of which would be easily detectable by some other means .",
    "the only possibility left is twisted ambient magnetic field .",
    "a simulation for both shells indicates that the top shell is expanding into a magnetic field with @xmath28 and the bottom one with @xmath29 .",
    "the lower surface brightness of the top shell supports this finding .",
    "the radio surface brightness goes down with @xmath22 , because the magnetic field inside the snr is more and more along the line of sight ( see also equation  [ flux ] ) .",
    "radio observations of other galaxies show twisted magnetic spurs emerging from star forming regions ( e.g. review by @xcite ) .",
    "da530 is located above an area of the milky way , which is rich in star forming regions , hii regions , and snrs .",
    "is da530 expanding inside these twisted magnetic spurs ?",
    "in terms of the large - scale galactic magnetic field , the community generally agrees that the field is directed clockwise in our local arm , as viewed from the north galactic pole , and that there is at least one large - scale magnetic field reversal ( a region of magnetic shear where the field is seen to reverse directions by roughly @xmath30 ) in the inner galaxy between the local and sagittarius - carina arms ( @xcite,@xcite ) , as indicated by the filled arrows in quadrant 1 ( q1 ) in fig .",
    "in addition to the existence and location of magnetic field reversals is the question of field alignment with the optical spiral arms .",
    "it is often assumed that the field is closely aligned with the spiral arms .",
    "@xcite demonstrated conclusively that the field in the fourth quadrant ( q4 ) of the sagittarius - carina arm is directed clockwise , the same as the local field .",
    "this presents a continuity problem if the field does indeed follow the optical arms and is counter - clockwise in q1 of the sagittarius - carina arm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mw ] ( left ) . however , if the field is much less inclined than the optical spiral arms , perhaps even purely azimuthal as suggested by @xcite , the continuity problem is resolved , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mw ] ( right ) . to find additional evidence a good place to look is towards the anti - centre region of the milky way .",
    "if the large - scale magnetic field of our galaxy is azimuthal the magnetic field component parallel to the line of sight @xmath0 would be 0 towards a galactic longitude of @xmath30 and if the magnetic field follows the spiral arms we would expect @xmath31 towards galactic longitude between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the snr g182.4 + 4.3 ( fig .",
    "[ g182 ] ) is conveniently located close to the anti - centre at a galactic longitude of @xmath34 .",
    "unfortunately only one shell of this snr is visible , likely because the bottom shell is expanding towards the galactic plane into higher density and the top shell away from the plane into very low density .",
    "however , without emission from the centre of the snr we can not easily determine the foreground @xmath2 . on the bottom shell we find a rm gradient which goes from about 0 in the right to about 50rad / m@xmath4 on the left ( fig .",
    "[ g182 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the ambient magnetic field is pointing towards us from back left to front right .",
    "this is not surprising , since the magnetic field in the outer galaxy should be directed from higher to lower longitudes and we are here at a longitude which is higher than the @xmath31 point for both possible magnetic field configurations . neglecting the foreground contribution for the rm we can determine an upper limit for @xmath22 by simulating a snr for the rm map of g182.4 + 4.3 .",
    "the result is independent of the distance to g182.4 + 4.3 .",
    "we derive @xmath35 , hence the galactic longitude at which @xmath31 must be larger than @xmath36 . if we now assume that the foreground magnetic field has the same @xmath22 as the snr s ambient field and the foreground field is constant at @xmath23 g , which would be a reasonable assumption , we would find @xmath37 .",
    "this supports the assumption that the milky way has an azimuthal magnetic field structure .",
    "the dominion radio astrophysical observatory is a national facility operated by the national research council canada .",
    "the canadian galactic plane survey is a canadian project with international partners , and is supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council ( nserc ) .",
    "this research is based on observations with the 100-m telescope of the mpifr at effelsberg ."
