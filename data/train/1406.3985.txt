    "one of the main obstacles for a general breakthrough of electric automobiles is the development of a high - capacity , cheap and safe rechargeable battery .",
    "the most widely used cathode material is by far licoo@xmath2 @xcite , however , cobalt is very expensive and there is a strong driving force to find new cheaper and more environmental friendly cathode materials .",
    "one of the big problems for battery application is the structural distortions that occur @xcite when large amounts of li is deintercalated during charge / discharge cycles of the battery [ see fig .  1 ] .",
    "some efforts have been made to minimize these effects @xmath8 by combining co and ni into a lini@xmath9co@xmath10o@xmath2 solid solution .",
    "however , this compound suffers from strong intermixing of ni into the li layers for the highly delithiated state @xcite .",
    "recently , the mixed transition metal oxides ( mtmo s ) of the form li@xmath0ni@xmath11co@xmath12mn@xmath13o@xmath2 have become the center of attention @xcite .",
    "in particular has the li@xmath0ni@xmath1co@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 compound @xcite been put forward as one of the most promising battery electrode materials for the future .",
    "the structure of these compounds is the same as for the fundamental licoo@xmath2 i.e. a rhomohedral lattice ( space group @xmath14 ) where ni / co / mno@xmath2 planes are stacked between nonmagnetic li layers along the @xmath15-axis [ see fig .  1 ] . in similarity with linio@xmath2",
    "some intermixing of ni in the li layers can be expected .",
    "however , in this particular case , this actually helps to stabilize the structure and improve capacity retention @xcite .",
    "in addition to their extensive use in energy related applications , these materials also display very interesting and complex magnetic properties at lower temperatures .",
    "this is due to the 2d triangular antiferromagnetic ( af ) lattice @xcite ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) created by the transition metal ions . for the li@xmath0ni@xmath1co@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds the situation is even more complex since a combination of three different transition metals is present within the geometrically frustrated magnetic planes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have investigated both the low - temperature magnetic properties as well as the high - temperature ion - diffusion for two li@xmath0ni@xmath1co@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 samples ( @xmath16  and  0.3 ) using muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath17sr ) .",
    "powder samples of li@xmath0ni@xmath1co@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 compound were prepared at uppsala university , sweden . for the low - temperature magnetic measurements , two samples ( @xmath16  and  0.3 ) of approximately 1 g each were placed in small envelopes made of very thin al - coated mylar tape and then attached to a low - background , fork - type , sample holder .",
    "subsequently , high - resolution @xmath17sr spectra were measured at the ( continuous , dc ) swiss muon source ( s@xmath18s ) , paul scherrer institute , villigen , switzerland . by using the muon beamline @xmath19e1 with the dolly spectrometer , zero - field ( zf ) and weak transverse - field ( wtf ) spectra",
    "were collected for 2  k  @xmath20  150  k. for the ion - diffusion experiments , approximately 2 grams of the same samples were pressed into two discs with a 24  mm diameter and 1.5  mm thickness . inside a helium glove - box",
    "the discs were packed into a au - sealed ( gold o - ring ) powder cells made of pure titanium using a thin ( @xmath21 m ) kapton film as entrance window for the muons .",
    "in addition , a silver mask with a hole matching the samples diameter was mounted onto the cell to ensure that the any minor background signal is non - relaxing over a wide temperature range .",
    "the cell was mounted onto the cu end - plate of a liquid - he flow - type cryostat in the temperature range between 10 and 500  k. subsequently , zf- , wtf- and lf-@xmath22sr spectra were collected using the riken - ral / argus spectrometer at the pulsed muon source isis / ral in uk .",
    "the experimental techniques are described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "to obtain a first insight into the nature of the magnetic order in these compounds , we acquired zero - field ( zf ) data at the lowest temperature ( @xmath23  k ) . the @xmath22sr time",
    "spectrum show no indication of spontaneous muon precession , but rather only a fast exponentially decaying signal for both samples [ see fig .",
    "2(a - b ) ] .",
    "such signal indicate either a wide field - distribution , which is typical for spin - glasses ( sg ) or the presence of dynamical correlations .",
    "however , recent magnetometry measurements of our samples ( @xmath16 and @xmath24 ) using zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) protocols @xcite clearly show a divergence around @xmath25  k , which is a clear indication for a magnetically frustrated sg state .",
    "further , information obtained also from related compounds using magnetometry as well as @xmath17sr @xcite clearly favours the static sg scenario .",
    "the zf data was found to be well fitted to the sum of a very fast exponentially relaxing signal and a slower decaying stretched - exponential function : @xmath26 } , \\label{eq : zffit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this kind of stretched exponential relaxation is found to appear in a range of different systems , however , they are commonly connected to sg systems @xcite containing geometrical frustration @xmath8 the title compound . in similarity to our previous @xmath17sr studies of the closely related li(ni@xmath27co@xmath28mn@xmath28)o@xmath29 compound @xcite , we find that also the present compounds enter into a disordered spin - glass ( sg ) state at lowest temperature ( @xmath23  k ) .",
    "further , from the fits to eq .",
    "1 the critical exponent @xmath30 reaches a value @xmath31 [ @xmath32 and @xmath33 , indicating a decreased dimensionality ( most likely 2d , considering the layered structure ) . from zf measurements at @xmath34  k as well as @xmath35  k it is evident that both samples are in a paramagnetic state above at least @xmath34  k [ see insets fig .",
    "2(a - b ) ] .    to further investigate the pm to sg phase - transition we also performed detailed weak - transverse field ( wtf  = 50  g ) measurements as a function of temperature .",
    "the wtf @xmath22sr time spectra for selected temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "2(c - d ) . around @xmath25",
    "k a total suppression of the externally applied field is seen as annihilation of the wtf asymmetry ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the data is found to be well fitted by a combination of an exponentially relaxing cosine oscillation and a fast relaxing component ( the latter becomes dominant at and below the transition ) : @xmath37 from such fits , the temperature dependence of @xmath36 can be extracted and a better picture of the transition is obtained [ fig .",
    "2(e - f ) ] . for both samples",
    "it is clear that a magnetic phase transition into the previously mentioned sg state occurs at @xmath3  k where @xmath36 drops to zero very rapidly .",
    "this is in fact rather different from the li(ni@xmath27co@xmath28mn@xmath28)o@xmath29 compound @xcite where we found a gradual transition over a 50  k wide temperature range .",
    "hence , contrary to the cluster glass like state found for the previous compound , li@xmath0ni@xmath1co@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 is believed to enter into a simple sg phase below @xmath38 .",
    "this could possibly be explained by the equal distribution of transition metals creating a higher degree of disorder on the tmo planes .",
    "worth noticing is also that the @xmath16 sample seems to have a slightly wider transition than @xmath24 .",
    "this could be an artefact related to too low statistics for the wtf data .",
    "another explanation could be that stoichiometric @xmath16 samples are well known to be notoriously difficult to synthesize .",

    "the static width of the local field distribution ( @xmath44 ) was from individual fitting found to be more or less independent of temperature and was finally also treated as a common parameter for the global fit over the entire temperature range for each sample [ @xmath45  s@xmath46 and @xmath47  s@xmath46 ] .",
