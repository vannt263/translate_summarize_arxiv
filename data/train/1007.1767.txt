    "the quasinormal modes of black holes were intensively studied during the last decade .",
    "the great interest in the quasinormal modes is motivated on the one side by astrophysics and especially by the expected recent observation of one of the most important predictions of general relativity  the gravitational waves .",
    "information about the physical properties of the black holes ( and other compact objects ) can be obtained through the emission of gravitational waves and the characteristic frequencies of ringing , namely the frequencies of the quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) @xcite .",
    "the qnms would allow us to distinguish between different compact objects  black holes , stars , to distinguish between different theories of gravity since they predict different characteristic spectra , to determine the global asymptotic charges like mass , charge , and angular momentum of the observed black holes and so on @xcite .    on the other side ,",
    "the quasinormal modes are interesting and important for intrinsic theoretical reasons . during the last decade ,",
    "the quasinormal modes became a powerful tool for the study of various pure theoretical problems which deepen our knowledge of spacetime and gravity , especially in the regime of strong fields @xcite .",
    "they may serve , for example , as an indicator of black - hole phase transitions @xcite@xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the scalar sector of the quasinormal modes of general relativistic , static , and spherically symmetric black - hole solutions coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics which are also solutions to the field equations of a certain class of scalar - tensor theories with nonlinear electrodynamics , i.e. , they can be viewed as embedded in the scalar - tensor theories under consideration . in this paper",
    ", we consider a class of scalar - tensor theories defined by zero potential @xmath0 and a coupling function @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant is @xmath4 and more details can be found in the next section . ] . these scalar - tensor theories . ]",
    "are indistinguishable from the general relativity in weak field regime ( the post - newtonian parameters have the same values as in gr ) , but can differ seriously from it in the strong field regime as it was first shown in @xcite for neutron stars .",
    "it is natural to try to find similar non - perturbative deviation from gr when black holes are considered as sources of strong gravitational filed . according to several no - scalar - hair theorems , however , in the case when no matter sources are present in the theory @xcite and in the case when the scalar - tensor theories are coupled to linear electrodynamics @xcite , the static , spherically symmetric black - hole solutions are indistinguishable from the corresponding solutions in gr ( see also @xcite ",
    "these theorems can be eluded when the scalar - tensor theories are coupled to non - linear electrodynamics since it has a non - vanishing trace of the energy - momentum tensor , and this nonzero trace acts as a source of the scalar field giving rise to black holes with nontrivial scalar field .",
    "such scalar - tensor black holes were first found in @xcite and @xcite . within the particular class of scalar - tensor theories considered here ,",
    "the static and spherically symmetric black holes coupled to nonlinear born - infeld electrodynamics were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that black holes with nontrivial scalar field can exist only for @xmath5 .",
    "the most interesting result in @xcite is the fact that the considered class of scalar tensor theories with @xmath5 allows the existence of non - unique black - hole solutions with the same mass and charge .",
    "this disproves the no - hair conjecture according to which the static scalar - tensor black holes are uniquely specified by their conserved asymptotic charges , namely , the mass and the charge .",
    "in other words , the scalar - tensor black holes can support primary scalar hair in contrast with the secondary scalar hair uniquely determined by the mass and the charge .    among the non - unique solutions present in the considered theory",
    "is the solution with zero ( trivial ) scalar field which is just the solution of the pure einstein equations coupled to nonlinear born - infeld electrodynamics . from now on ,",
    "the embedding of this general relativistic solution in the scalar - tensor theories under consideration will be called `` _ the trivial solution _ '' .",
    "it turns out that in a certain class of scalar - tensor theories , the perturbations of the trivial solution form two independent sectors  scalar and metric - vector sector . in other words , the perturbations of the scalar field",
    "decouple from the perturbations of the metric and electromagnetic field .",
    "the equations governing the perturbations of the metric and the electromagnetic field coincide with those of pure general relativity . since we are interested in the scalar - tensor theories , we focus only on the scalar sector .",
    "the equation governing the scalar perturbations feels not only the background metric and background electromagnetic field but also involves a term coming from the scalar - tensor theory under consideration .",
    "the presence of this scalar - tensor term in the potential leads to interesting consequences .",
    "especially , the scalar - tensor term with @xmath5 gives negative contribution to the potential of the scalar perturbations and a negative minimum in the potential appear for a certain domain of the parameter space .",
    "the bound states associated with the negative minimum of the potential correspond to unstable modes .",
    "therefore , for a certain sector of the parameter space , the trivial solution becomes unstable .",
    "how the instability of the trivial solution should be interpreted ?",
    "our interpretation is that the instability is a sign for the existence of new black - hole solutions with nontrivial primary scalar hair which bifurcate from the trivial solution at critical parameters corresponding to the static zero - modes .",
    "we prove this interpretation by numerically solving the full system of static , spherically symmetric scalar - tensor field equations and finding the explicit solutions with nontrivial scalar field .",
    "the number of nontrivial scalar - tensor black - hole solutions that bifurcate from the trivial one turns out to be in one to one correspondence with the number of bounded states of the scalar perturbations potential . in this way",
    ", we find a wide spectrum of new solutions which is much richer than what was previously found in @xcite .",
    "we examine also the stability of the nontrivial solutions .",
    "we show that the nontrivial solutions for which the scalar field has zeros are unstable against radial perturbations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the necessary background of general equations . in section 3",
    ", the equation governing the scalar perturbations is derived .",
    "the numerical methods for the calculations of the qnms and the numerical results are presented in section 4 .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions describing hairy black holes and bifurcating from the trivial solution are found numerically in section 5 . in section 6 , we examine the stability of the nontrivial black - hole solutions .",
    "the paper ends with discussion .",

    "that is why we shall restrict our considerations in this region of values of @xmath3 .",
    "the scalar - tensor theories with @xmath2 ( and cosmological value @xmath23 ) as we have already mentioned are indistinguishable from general relativity in the weak field regime but can exhibit non - perturbative effects and can differ seriously from general relativity in the strong field regime @xcite,@xcite .    in order to be specific , we will consider here the born - infeld nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "an important property of this nonlinear electrodynamics is that it is invariant under electric - magnetic duality rotation so it is enough to consider only magnetically charged solutions , and the electrically charged can be simply obtained from them . for pure magnetic solutions , @xmath24 and",

    "we consider scalar fields that vanish at infinity .",
    "taking into account that @xmath35 it is not difficult to see that every static , spherically symmetric solution of the einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics is also a solution to the above system with @xmath36 .",
    "the general relativistic solution describing black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics is naturally embedded in the class of scalar - tensor theories under consideration and , as we have already mentioned , will be called _ the trivial solution_. the metric functions of the trivial solution are given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the hypergeometric function @xcite and @xmath39 is the black hole mass .    for the trivial solution",
    ", it can be easily proven that extremal black - hole solutions can exist only for @xmath40 .",
    "however , no extremal black holes can exists in the considered class of scalar - tensor theories when the scalar field is nontrivial .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the perturbations of the trivial solution within the framework of the described class of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "the metric perturbations will be denoted by @xmath41 , the electromagnetic perturbations is the gauge potential , i.e. , @xmath42 . ] by @xmath43 and the scalar ones by @xmath44 . since the trivial solution has zero scalar field , it is not difficult to see that in the considered class of scalar - tensor theories the equations governing the perturbations of the metric @xmath41 and the electromagnetic field @xmath43 are decoupled from the equation governing the perturbations @xmath44 of the scalar field",
    ". the equations for @xmath41 and @xmath43 are in fact the same as those in the pure einstein gravity .",
    "since we are interested in black holes in the scalar - tensor theories we will focus only on the scalar perturbations @xmath44 .    from the third field equation in ( [ eq : fieldeq ] ) , we obtain the following equation governing the perturbations of the scalar field @xmath45 \\delta \\varphi , \\label{eq : pertfieldeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the covariant derivative @xmath46 and the function @xmath47 are with respect to the unperturbed background solution .",
    "since the background solution is static and spherically symmetric , the variables can be separated in the following way @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a parameter and @xmath50 are the spherical harmonics . after substituting in ( [ pereq1 ] )",

    "the reduced system of equations ( [ eq : odedelta])([eq : odephi ] ) is invariant under the rigid rescaling @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , one may generate in this way a family of new solutions .",

    "thus we have to find the qnm frequencies governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : perteqorig ] ) ( or equivalently by eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodtypeeq ] ) ) where the boundary condition are the standard ones : purely outgoing wave at infinity and purely ingoing wave at the black hole horizon .",
    "we have to note that the problem reduces to studying the scalar perturbations of the pure einstein - born - infeld black holes when the parameter in the coupling function @xmath66 and this case is studied in @xcite .",
    "are qualitatively similar to the results obtained by fernando and holbrook in @xcite but the computed numerical values of the frequencies are different . ]",
    "it is the potential @xmath52 that determines the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the qnms for the already fixed boundary conditions .",
    "that is why we will first comment on the qualitative behavior of @xmath52 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : potentu ] ) .",
    "it can be easily checked that the only difference between the equation governing the perturbations of the scalar field ( [ eq : perteqorig ] ) and the equation governing the scalar perturbations in the case of pure einstein - born - infeld theory is the term @xmath67 $ ] in the potential ( [ eq : potentu ] ) .",
    "when we take into account equation ( [ eq : biinequality ] ) , it is clear that the sign of this term is the same as the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the potential can become negative when @xmath5 . on fig .",
    "[ fig : u(r ) ] , the potential @xmath68 for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is plotted for a range of parameters .",
    "as it can be seen , a positive maximum is present for all curves , and the numerical results show that such maximum also exists for all of the studied values of the parameters @xmath39 , @xmath31 , @xmath3 , and @xmath72 . for large values of the charge ,",
    "an additional negative minimum appears when @xmath5 , and it can lead to instabilities . when @xmath73 , the potential is qualitatively the same as for the pure einstein case .    for fixed values of the parameters",
    ", the depth of the potential well , if it exists , decreases with the increase of @xmath72 because of the contribution of the second term in ( [ eq : potentu ] ) . for high enough @xmath72 ,",
    "the potential becomes positive .",
    "the calculation of the qnms in practice , however , faces serious numerical difficulties .",
    "the first reason for that is the complexity of the background solution which can not be expressed in elementary functions as well as the presence of negative minimum in the potential for some values of the parameters .",
    "this makes us use direct integration methods which has limited abilities since the more sophisticated and accurate methods are unapplicable .",
    "the second reason is the numerical instabilities that appear in the region of transition from stable to unstable modes which will be discussed below .",
    "it is well known that even for the schwarzschild solution , the direct integration methods face serious difficulties when the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequencies becomes greater than the real part .",
    "it turns out that the properties of the perturbation functions and the modes in the stable and unstable sector are different , and that is why it is useful to consider the stable and the unstable modes separately .",
    "more precisely , as we shall see below , the unstable modes define a self - adjoined sturm - liouville boundary value problem for which the eigenvalues are real .",
    "this simplifies the treatment of the problem and makes the numerical procedure stable .",
    "the required qnms boundary conditions lead to an exponential growth of the radial perturbation function for the stable modes as @xmath74 . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we use the numerical procedure introduced by chandrasekhar and detweiler @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the idea of the method is to introduce a new function @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the radial part of the perturbations of the scalar field .",
    "equation ( [ eq : schrodtypeeq ] ) transforms into a riccati type equation @xmath78 and the boundary conditions , according to the sign convention in ( [ eq : separvar ] ) , are @xmath79    we apply the following shooting procedure for calculating the qnm frequencies .",
    "equation ( [ eq : perteqshooting ] ) is integrated for test values of the complex parameter @xmath49 and a qnm frequency @xmath49 is found when the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc_shooting ] ) are satisfied within the required accuracy . for each test value of @xmath49",
    "two integrations are performed  inward and outward , and they are described below in details .    first , we integrate equation ( [ eq : perteqshooting ] ) outward from a chosen point @xmath80 to a matching point @xmath81 which is close to the maximum of the potential .",
    "the initial condition at @xmath82 is computed using the expansion of the function @xmath77 at the black hole horizon @xmath83 where @xmath57 is the radius of the horizon and @xmath84 are constants ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 ( @xmath88 ) can be calculated from the recurrence relation that is obtained when we substitute ( [ eq : bc_rh ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodtypeeq ] ) .",
    "the second inward integration is from a chosen point @xmath89 is chosen so that the ratio @xmath90 is kept fixed . ]",
    "to the same matching point @xmath91 and the initial condition at @xmath89 is calculated from the asymptotic expansion at infinity @xmath92 where @xmath93 are constants ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath93 ( @xmath88 ) can be found from a recurrence relation derived in the same way as for the @xmath84 .",
    "after the two integrations , we compare the values of the function @xmath96 , resulting from the inward and outward integration , at the matching point @xmath81 , and a qnm frequency @xmath49 is found when these values coincide within the required accuracy .",
    "as it is pointed out in @xcite , the numerical method we use may become unstable when the imaginary part of the qnm frequency becomes greater that the real one , and this situation actually occurs in our calculations in the region of transition from stable to unstable modes .",
    "that is why we have to use a stiff ode solver , and during our tests , it turned out that the semi - implicit extrapolation method described in numerical recipes @xcite is a very good choice .",
    "the search of qnm frequencies @xmath49 described above , can be considered as a root search procedure , and we used the muller method for it @xcite .      according to our sign convention in ( [ eq : separvar ] ) , the unstable qnm frequencies should have negative imaginary part . in this case",
    ", we can substitute @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are both real and @xmath99 is negative . hence , the boundary conditions for the unstable quasi - normal modes are vanishing on both ends @xmath100 but in this case the boundary value problem ( bvp ) discussed above is self - adjoint and has real eigenvalues @xmath101 . therefore , the unstable qnm frequencies should be purely imaginary , and they correspond to the bound states of the potential well . more information on this subject can be found in @xcite , and similar considerations , but for neutron starts in scalar - tensor theories , are made in @xcite .",
    "the perturbation function @xmath77 for the unstable modes will have no zeros for the first bound state , one zero for the second bound state , and so on .",
    "the function @xmath96 defined by ( [ eq : definephase ] ) is divergent in the points where @xmath77 is equal to zero which makes the numerical procedure used by chandrasekhar and detweiler inapplicable for calculating the unstable modes ( except for the first bound state where @xmath77 has no zeros ) .",
    "hence , we have to solve the original equation for the @xmath77 function ( [ eq : schrodtypeeq ] ) and the same expansions on the boundaries ( [ eq : bc_rh ] ) and ( [ eq : bc_inf ] ) can be used for calculating the boundary conditions .",
    "the numerical method used is quite similar to the shooting procedure described above : equation ( [ eq : schrodtypeeq ] ) is integrated inward and outward for test values of the parameter @xmath49 , and because of the arbitrary linear scale , it is enough to match at the chosen point @xmath81 only the quantities @xmath102 resulting from the two integrations .",
    "we calculate the qnm frequencies of the trivial solutions using the numerical techniques described above .",
    "as we said , we will restrict ourselves to calculating the qnm frequencies for @xmath22 which is required from the observational constraints .",
    "the presented results are for non - extremal black holes , i.e. , for @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the end of the sequences of black - hole solutions is reached when @xmath104 which , for example , for @xmath105 corresponds to charge @xmath106 .",
    "the results in the case when extremal black holes are present(i.e . , for @xmath40 ) are qualitatively the same .    before proceeding further",
    ", we will give some remarks on the computational abilities of the numerical method we use .",
    "as the numerical method is unstable in the region where the imaginary part of @xmath49 is greater that the real part , we can compute only the fundamental ( @xmath107 ) qnm frequency when @xmath71 , because even for schwarzschild black hole , the @xmath108 , @xmath71 mode is @xmath109 and the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part is beyond the computational abilities of the method we use .",
