    "the charge neutral point @xmath1 , where conduction and valence bands touch at a single point , reveals an important aspect of the physics of graphene  @xcite .",
    "for example , when @xmath1 is aligned to fermi energy @xmath2 , graphene shows strong electronic correlations that are not explained by the theory that describes typical metallic systems  @xcite . upon introducing dopants ( or charges ) , many - body effects are developed to show well - defined quasiparticle states near @xmath1 induced by electron - plasmon interactions , so - called plasmaron bands , right next to the well - known graphene @xmath0 bands  @xcite .",
    "such electronic correlations are strongly affected by the presence of a substrate .",
    "especially , when dielectric screening from the substrate becomes stronger compared to that for free - standing graphene , the plasmaron bands approach towards the graphene @xmath0 bands , so that they are not resolved , but leave their signature as high spectral intensity at @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "alternatively the electron band structure itself can result in the spectral feature at @xmath1 . on the surface of an sic(0001 ) substrate , a carbidic layer , so - called buffer layer ,",
    "is formed with the same geometric structure as graphene in the absence of the characteristic conical dispersion due to the formation of covalent bonds with the substate  @xcite . upon the formation of single - layer graphene on top of it ,",
    "the presence of the buffer layer breaks the sublattice symmetry of the single - layer graphene resulting in an energy gap at @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile localized @xmath0 states of the buffer layer couple to the graphene @xmath0 bands which contributes to finite spectral intensity at @xmath1 , i.e. , in - gap states , despite the plasmaron bands are not taken into account  @xcite . in fact , recent _ gw _ calculations give no well - defined plasmaron bands in the epitaxial doped single - layer graphene on an sic substrate  @xcite , in contrast to the previous theoretical @xcite and experimental results  @xcite .",
    "here we investigate this controversial issue by comparing the electron band structure of single- and double - layer graphene samples using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "single - layer graphene shows high spectral intensity at @xmath1 consistent with previous results  @xcite . on the other hand , in double - layer graphene ,",
    "we observe that the electron band structure shows a dip in spectral intensity at @xmath1 .",
    "the difference in the spectral feature is well described in terms of the in - gap states , whereas the plasmaron bands does not explain the weak spectral intensity observed at @xmath1 of double - layer graphene on an sic(0001 ) substrate and even single - layer graphene on metallic substrates .",
    "our results suggest that the in - gap states induced by the buffer layer  @xcite are the main ingredient of the controversial high spectral intensity at @xmath1 of single - layer graphene on the sic substrate .",
    "graphene samples were prepared by the epitaxial growth method on an sic(0001 ) substrate  @xcite and the chemical vapour deposition method on a cu film  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : fig1](a ) shows an arpes intensity map of a buffer layer sample taken along the @xmath7 direction of the graphene unit cell denoted in the inset , which is consistent with the previous results  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , near @xmath2 two non - dispersive states are observed at 1.7  ev and 0.5  ev below @xmath2 as denoted by white arrows .",
    "such a non - dispersive feature is also clear in energy distribution curves ( edcs ) taken at different momentum values as denoted by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "the former originates from the si dangling bond states which belong to the si - rich surface of the sic(0001 ) substrate , so - called @xmath8 phase , formed before the buffer layer is grown on the substrate  @xcite . with the formation of the buffer layer , several flat bands are predicted below @xmath2 originating from the @xmath0-orbitals of carbon atoms  @xcite , which are observed as the non - dispersive state 0.5  ev below @xmath2 .",

    "figure  [ fig : fig2](a ) shows the @xmath0 bands of single - layer graphene that are intrinsically doped by electrons due to the presence of the sic substrate  @xcite , so that @xmath1 lies @xmath90.43  ev below @xmath2 .",
    "the measured arpes intensity map exhibits two additional features in addition to the characteristic conical dispersion : ( i ) finite spectral intensity away from the graphene @xmath0 bands as denoted by the white arrow ; ( ii ) strong spectral intensity at @xmath1 in the graphene @xmath0 bands .",

    "it is known that , as the graphene layers develop , the buffer layer is increasingly covered by the graphene overlayers  @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with what we have observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "alternatively , due to the finite mean free path of electrons within a solid , increasing thickness of graphene layers can reduce photoelectron intensity from the buffer layer states .",

    "however , since single - layer of mose@xmath12 whose thickness ( 0.33  nm  @xcite ) is comparable to that of double - layer graphene clearly shows photoelectron signal from its substrate  @xcite , the mean free path issue for the samples with a thickness of @xmath30.35  nm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) may be less likely the origin of the completely disappeared intensity of the buffer layer states observed from the double - layer graphene sample as shown in figs .",

    "one of its plausible origins is the formation of plasmaron bands induced by electron - plasmon interactions  @xcite .",
    "when graphene is placed on an sic(0001 ) substrate , the dielectric screening can suppress these electronic correlations , so that the plasmaron bands approach towards the graphene @xmath0 bands  @xcite . as a result",

    "[ fig : fig4](b ) , the edc shows a dip in between two peaks corresponding to the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum ( as denoted by blue dashed lines ) .",
    "this indicates that our double - layer graphene sample does not show the characteristic feature of the plasmaron bands reported in the case of single - layer graphene  @xcite .",
    "however , not only single - layer graphene , but also double - layer graphene is predicted to exhibit the plasmaron bands in the presence of charge imbalance between the adjacent layers  @xcite , which is intrinsically induced in epitaxial double - layer graphene on an sic(0001 ) substrate  @xcite as shown in fig .  [",

    "in addition , for single - layer graphene , the separation between the extended lines and the conduction ( or valence ) band is 95@xmath1414  mev , which is bigger than our experimental resolution , 32  mev , as much as by a factor of 3 .",
