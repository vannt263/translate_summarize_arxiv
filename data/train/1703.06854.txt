    "the physics of graphene @xcite with the current advanced technologies opens large research and applied fields including wide spectrum of investigations from low - energy condensed matter physics to quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) effects @xcite due to exotic features of quasiparticles in graphene that behave like massless `` relativistic '' dirac fermions ( with the fermi velocity much less than the light speed in vacuum : @xmath0 ) and obey a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac equation @xcite .",
    "these properties of quasiparticles lead to various applications of graphene to replicate the fundamental nonlinear qed processes in much weaker electromagnetic ( em ) fields compared to common materials and vacuum where superintense laser fields of ultrarelativistic intensities are required for observation of nonlinear phenomena such as production of electron - positron pairs from the vacuum , nonlinear compton scattering , multiphoton stimulated bremsstrahlung ( sb ) etc , proceeding actually in the current strong and superstrong laser fields 7,7a,7aa,7aaa .    among the important processes induced by external radiation fields sb",
    "is one of the first stimulated effects at laser - matter interaction revealed immediately after the invention of lasers @xcite .",
    "the latter is basic mechanism of energy exchange between the charged particles and plane monochromatic wave in plasma - like media to provide the energy - momentum conservation law for real absorption - emission processes .",
    "what concerns the electrons elastic scattering on impurity ions in graphene , there are many papers with consideration of this basic scattering effect which have been described mainly within the framework of perturbation theory by electrostatic potential ( see , e.g. , bornellastic , chen2008,bornel1,bornel2,bornel3,tanadam2007,katsnelson ) . regarding the sb process in graphene at moderate intensities of stimulated radiation , in case of its linear absorption by electrons ( or holes ) ,",
    "at the present time there are extensive investigations carried out in the scope of the linear theory , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the linear absorbance of single layer graphene from infrared up to visible spectral range is @xmath1 which depends solely on the fine - structure constant @xmath2  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "consequently , taking into account the graphene thickness , the absorption coefficient will be @xmath4 , which is a remarkably high value for absorption effect .",
    "on the other hand , high em radiation absorption by ultrasmall volumes is a very challenging property for shielding materials used in nanoelectronics , aviation , and space industry , where strict requirements on lightness and smallness of materials exist . in this aspect , due to its unique properties graphene _ _  _ _ can act as a thz emitting device and/or shielding material for nanodevices , enabling to bridge so - called thz gap @xcite . _ _  _ _ meanwhile , consideration of multiphoton sb process in graphene in moderately strong laser fields as a basic mechanism for radiation absorption towards the mentioned applications is absent up to now .",
    "the latter is given in the current paper .",
    "in general , the interaction of a free electron with the em wave is described by the dimensionless relativistic invariant parameter of intensity @xmath5",
    "@xcite , which represents the wave electric field ( with amplitude @xmath6 )  work on a wavelength @xmath7  in the units of electron rest energy . particularly for thz photons @xmath8",

    "three regimes of the wave - particle interaction may be established : @xmath17   that corresponds to one - photon interaction regime @xcite , @xmath18  which is the static field limit of superpower fields in qed or schwinger regime @xcite , and @xmath19   is the multiphoton interaction regime @xcite with the corresponding intensity @xmath20",

    "comparison of this intensity threshold with the analogous one for the free electrons or situation in common atoms shows the essential difference between the values of these thresholds : @xmath22 .",

    "the influence of multiphoton effects in sb  absorption process with moderately strong laser fields is considered . here",
    "the selected frequency range of terahertz radiation excludes the valence electrons excitations at high fermi energies .    in sec .",
    "i the scattering rates and total multiphoton cross - sections for sb of conduction electrons in graphene have been obtained .",
    "the analytic formulas in case of screened coulomb potential have been analyzed numerically in sec .",
    "we have also present results for the angular dependence of scattered fermi electrons on the laser radiation intensities .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "below we will develop the relativistic scattering theory for the 2d dirac fermions on arbitrary electrostatic potential @xmath24 of an impurity ion in doped graphene and interacting with an external em  wave field of moderate intensities . to exclude the valence electrons excitations at high fermi energies in graphene , we will assume for a em  wave actually a terahertz radiation .",
    "let us determine the scattering green function formalism in the born approximation by potential @xmath24 .",
