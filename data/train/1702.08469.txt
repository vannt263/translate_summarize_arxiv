    "the study of topologically ordered phases , their relation , and the transitions between them has received steadily growing attention in the last decade .",
    "their lack of local order parameters , the dependence of the ground space structure on their topology , and the exotic nature of their anyonic excitations puts them outside the landau framework of symmetry breaking and local order parameters , and thus asks for novel ways of characterizing and relating different phases , for instance the structure of their ground space or the nature of their non - trivial excitations ( anyons ) , and the way in which those are related throughout different phases .",
    "anyon condensation has been proposed as a mechanism for relating topological phases  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that some mechanism drives a species @xmath1 of bosonic anyons to condense into the vacuum .",
    "this , in turn , forces any anyon @xmath2 which has non - trivial statistics with @xmath1 to become confined , as a deconfined @xmath2 anyon would have non - trivial statistics with the new vacuum , and moreover leads to the identification of anyons which differ by fusion with @xmath1 .",
    "at the same time , the relation between anyon types and ground space of a theory suggests that this condensation is accompanied by a change in the ground space structure .",
    "the formalism of anyon condensation allows to construct `` simpler '' anyon models from more rich ones , and suggests to think of the `` condensate fraction '' of the condensed anyon as an order parameter for a landau - like description of the phase transition .",
    "yet , it is a priori not clear how such an order parameter should be measured , and existing approaches describe anyon condensation as a breaking of the global symmetry of the quantum group or tensor category underlying the model  @xcite .",
    "projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite form a natural framework for the local modelling of topologically ordered phases  @xcite .",
    "they associate to any lattice site a tensor which describes both the physical system at that site , and the way in which it is correlated to the adjacent sites through entanglement degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been shown that in peps , topological order emerges from a _ local _ symmetry constraint on the entanglement degrees of freedom , characterized by a group action ( for so - called double models of groups )  @xcite or more generally by matrix product operators for twisted doubles  @xcite and string - net models  @xcite . in all cases , both ground states and excitations",
    "can be modelled from the very same symmetries which characterize the local tensors : group actions and irreducible representations ( irreps ) in the former and matrix product operators with suitable endpoints in the latter case  @xcite .",
    "yet , it has been observed that the entanglement symmetry of the tensors is not in one - to - one correspondence with the topological order in the system : by adding a suitable deformation to the fixed point wavefunction , the system can be driven into a phase transition which is consistent with a description in terms of anyon condensation  @xcite .",
    "this raises the question : what is the exact relation between topological phase transitions in tensor networks and anyon condensation , and can we explain this transition `` miscroscopically '' using the local symmetries in the tensor network description ?    in this paper , we derive a comprehensive framework for the explanation , classification , and study of anyon condensation in peps .",
    "our framework explains and classifies anyon condensation in terms of the different `` entanglement phases '' emerging at the boundary under the action of the local entanglement symmetry of the tensor , and provides us with the tools to explicitly study the behavior of order parameters measuring condensation and confimement of anyons .",
    "more specifically , we show that the symmetry constraint in the entanglement degrees of freedom of the tensor gives rise to a corresponding `` doubled '' symmetry in the fixed point of the transfer operator , this is , in the entanglement spectrum at the boundary .",
    "anyon condensation can then be understood in terms of the different phases at the boundary , this is , the symmetry breaking pattern together with a possibly symmetry - protected phase of the residual unbroken symmetry .",
    "we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the condensation of anyons in abelian double models in terms of the symmetry at the boundary , and show that this completely classifies all condensation patterns in double models of cyclic groups , giving rise to all twisted @xmath3 double models .",
    "we also show that these conditions allow to independently derive the anyon condensation rules described above , providing a tensor network derivation of these conditions .",
    "the central idea is to relate anyon condensation and confinement to the behavior of string order parameters , which in turn can be related to symmetry breaking and symmetry - protected order , and combine this with the constraints arising from the positivity of the boundary state .",
    "we illustrate our framework by discussing all possible phases which can be obtained by condensation from a @xmath0 double model , which can give rise to toric code , doubled semion , and trivial phases .",
    "specifically , we show that the toric code and double semion can exhibit the same symmetry breaking pattern at the boundary , yet are distinguished by different spt orders , corresponding to the condensation of a charge or a dyon ( a combined charge - flux particle ) , respectively , and thus a different string order parameter .",
    "finally , we apply our framework to numerically study topological phases and the transitions between them along a range of different interpolations .",
    "specifically , the interpretation of condensation and confinement in terms of string order parameters allows us to directly measure order parameters for the different topological phases , namely condensate fractions and order parameters for deconfinement , which allow us to study the nature and order of the phase transitions .",
    "our framework also allows us to set up interpolations between the toric code and double semion phase , which are a priori not related by anyon condensation , and we find that depending on the nature of the interpolation , we can either find a second - order simultaneous confinement - deconfinement transition , or a first - order transition not characterized by anyon condensation .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : peps - definition - anyons ] , we introduce peps , explain how topological order and topological excitations are modelled within this framework , and define condensation and confinement in peps models . sec .  [",
    "sec : classification ] contains the classification of anyon condensation and confinement through the behavior of the boundary : we start by giving the intuition and the main technical assumption , then derive the conditions imposed by the symmetry structure and positivity of the boundary state , and finally show that this classification gives rise to the well - known anyon condensation rules . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zn - and - tw - dbl ] , we apply this classification to the case of @xmath3 quantum doubles and show that it precisely gives rise to all twisted @xmath4 double models . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : example - z4 ] , we illustrate our framework with a detailed discussion of the condensation from a @xmath0 double , and study the corresponding family of models and the transitions between them numerically .",
    "in this section , we will first introduce the general peps framework .",
    "we will then explain how certain symmetries in peps naturally lead to objects defined on the entanglement degrees of freedom which behave like anyonic excitations .",
    "the natural question is then to understand the conditions under which these objects describe observable anyons , or whether they fail to do so by either leaving the state invariant ( condensation ) or by evaluating to zero ( confinement ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we will focus our discussion to the case of abelian groups ; however , several of our arguments in fact apply to general groups , and even beyond that for so - called mpo - injective peps ; we will discuss these aspects in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .       * ( a ) * peps tensor @xmath5 with five indices . *",
    "( b ) * the peps wavefunction is built up by contracting the virtual indices @xmath6 of the peps tensors as indicated by connected lines . ]    let us start by introducing projected entangled pair states ( peps ) .",
    "we focus on a translational invariant system on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , where we take the system size to infinity .",
    "peps are constructed from a local tensor @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the _ physical _ index and @xmath9 are the _ virtual _ indices , and @xmath10 is called the bond dimension .",
    "graphically , they are depicted as a sphere with five legs , one for each index , cf .",
    "[ fig : peps - def]a ; equivalently , we can consider @xmath11 as a linear map from virtual to physical system .",
    "the tensor @xmath5 is then arranged on a square lattice , fig .",
    "[ fig : peps - def]b , and adjacent virtual indices are contracted ( i.e. , identified and summed over ) , which is graphically depicted by connecting the corresponding legs .",
    "we thus finally obtain a tensor @xmath12 which only has physical indices , and thus describes a quantum many - body state @xmath13 .",
    "a useful property of peps is the possibility to block sites  we can take the tensors on some @xmath14 patch and define them as a new tensor @xmath15 with correspondingly larger @xmath10 .",
    "this allows us to restrict statements about properties of localized regions to fixed - size ( e.g. , single - site or overlapping @xmath16 ) patches .    to any peps",
    ", one can naturally associate a family of parent hamiltonians which have this peps as their exact zero - energy ground state  @xcite .",
    "such a hamiltonian is a sum of local terms @xmath17 , each of which ensures that the state `` looks locally correct '' on a small patch , i.e. , as if it had been built from the tensor @xmath5 on that patch .",
    "this is accomplished by choosing @xmath18 such that @xmath17 is zero on the physical subspace spanned by the tensors on that patch ( for arbitrary virtual boundary conditions ) and positive otherwise ; note that by choosing a sufficiently large patch , it is always possible to find a non - trivial such hamiltonian ( the dimension of the allowed physical subspace scales with the boundary , while the available degrees of freedom scale with the volume ) .    clearly , the global peps wavefunction is a zero - energy state and thus a ground state of the parent hamiltonian @xmath19 . at the same time",
    ", conditions on @xmath5 are known under which this ground state is unique ( in a finite volume )  @xcite : specifically , it is sufficient if the map from the virtual to the physical system described by @xmath5 ( possibly after blocking ) is injective ; equivalently , this means that the full auxiliary space can be accessed by acting on the physical space only , i.e. , that one can apply a linear map which `` cuts out '' a tensor and gives direct access to the auxiliary indices .",
    "parent hamiltonians naturally give rise to the notion of localized excitations , this is , states whose energy differs from the ground state only in some local regions . to this end , one replaces some tensors by `` excitation tensors '' @xmath20 , while keeping the original tensor @xmath5 everywhere else , cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : local - excitations]a . for _ injective _ peps ,",
    "these are in fact the only possible localized excitations , since due to the one - to - one correspondence between virtual and physical system any tensor @xmath21 will yield an increased energy w.r.t .",
    "the parent hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "* ( a ) * replacing one tensor by a different tensor @xmath20 results in a localized excitation , i.e. , which is not detected by the parent hamiltonian anywhere else . *",
    "( b ) * an excitation is topologically trivial if @xmath20 can be obtained from @xmath5 by acting with a map @xmath22 on the physical system . ]",
    "a key question in the context of this work is when an excitation is topologically non - trivial .",
    "we will use the following definition : an excitation is topologically trivial exactly if it can be created ( with some non - zero probability ) by acting locally on the system , i.e. , if there exists a linear ( not necessarily unitary ) map @xmath22 on the physical system which will create that excitation on top of the ground state , this is , which transforms @xmath5 to @xmath20 .",
    "it is now straightforward to see that for an injective peps , all localized excitations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : local - excitations]a ) are topologically trivial : injectivity implies that @xmath5 ( as a map from virtual to physical system ) has a left - inverse @xmath23 , and thus @xmath24 will act as @xmath25 , i.e. , create the desired excitation locally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : local - excitations]b .",
    "let us now turn towards peps which can support topologically non - trivial excitations .",
    "to this end , we consider peps which are no longer injective , but enjoy a virtual symmetry under some group action , @xmath26 with @xmath27 a unitary representation of some finite group @xmath28 ; we will denote such tensors as @xmath29-invariant .",
    "graphically , this is expressed as @xmath30{figs / ginv - tensor}}\\quad,\\ ] ] where we use the convention that matrices act on the indices from left to right and down to up , such that @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g - invariance ] ) turns into @xmath32 .",
    "an important property of @xmath29-invariance is its stability under concatenation : when grouping together several @xmath29-invariant tensors , the resulting block is still @xmath29-invariant , as the @xmath27 and @xmath32 on the contracted indices exactly cancel out . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on abelian groups ( though various parts of the discussion generalize to the non - abelian case ) , and denote the neutral element by @xmath33 .    if @xmath29-invariance is the only symmetry of the tensor @xmath5 , i.e. , if @xmath5 is injective on the subspace left invariant by the symmetry , we call @xmath5 @xmath29-injective . the parent hamiltonians of @xmath29-injective peps have a topological ground space degeneracy and can support anyonic excitations  @xcite , as we will also discuss in the following .",
    "we will generally assume that the tensors are @xmath29-injective , since otherwise we might be missing a symmetry , likely rendering the discussion incomplete .",
    "in order to understand how these excitations look like , let us consider again the possible localized excitations w.r.t .  the parent hamiltonian . as we have seen earlier , any state where one tensor has been replaced by a different tensor @xmath20 is by construction a localized excitation . in the injective case",
    ", any such @xmath20 could be obtained by acting locally on the physical degrees of freedom , rendering the excitation topologically trivial .",
    "however , it is easy to see that this is no longer the case for @xmath29-invariant tensors : local operations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : local - excitations]b ) can only produce tensors @xmath20 which are again @xmath29-invariant , i.e. , transform trivially under the action of the symmetry group , since it is exactly the invariant virtual subspace which is accessible by acting on the physical indices .",
    "in contrast , @xmath20 s which transform non - trivially can no longer be created locally , and thus are topologically non - trivial excitations .",
    "it is natural to label these excitations by irreducible representations @xmath34 of the abelian symmetry group @xmath29 , this is , we can write @xmath35 where @xmath36{figs / balpha - trafo}\\ ] ] this is , any such excitation can be understood as a superposition of excitations with fixed @xmath37 , and we will focus on excitations with a fixed @xmath37 in the following .",
    "these excitations will be denoted as _ electric excitations _ with _",
    "charge @xmath37_. ( for non - abelian groups , we would require instead that each @xmath38 is supported on the irrep @xmath37 of the group action . )",
    "it is straightforward to see that for @xmath29-injective peps , the topological part of the excitation is fully characterized by @xmath37 : in case @xmath38 itself is injective on the irrep @xmath37 , this is immediate since it can be transformed into any other @xmath39 by locally acting on the physical index ; in case @xmath38 is not injective , the same can be done by acting on a @xmath40 block centered around @xmath37 ( due to @xmath29-injectivity , this allows to access all degrees of freedom at the boundary in the irrep @xmath37 ) .    in the following",
    ", we will focus our attention on electric excitations of the form @xmath41{figs / b - ralpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 ( the yellow diamond ) transforms as @xmath43 ; the general case will be discussed in appendix  [ sec : app : dressed ] .    an important point to note about electric excitations",
    "is that for any system with periodic boundaries , they must come in pairs ( or groups ) which together transform trivially under the symmetry action , i.e. , have total trivial charge , since otherwise the state would vanish .       a string of @xmath27 actions on the lattice can be freely moved [ eq .  ] , making it invisible to the parent hamiltonian except at its endpoints .",
    "it therefore describes a pair of topological excitations . ]    for injective peps , locally changing tensors was the only way to obtain localized excitations , due to the one - to - one correspondence of physical and virtual system  @xcite . for @xmath29-injective peps , however ,",
    "there exist ways to non - locally change the tensor network without creating an excitation , or only creating a localized excitation  @xcite . to this end ,",
    "note that eq .   can be reformulated as @xmath44{figs / pulling - through-1 } } \\mbox{\\ \\ and\\ \\ } \\raisebox{-1.5em}{\\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figs / pulling - through-2}}\\ ] ] and rotated versions thereof .",
    "this has the natural interpretation of the @xmath27 and @xmath32 forming strings ( symbolized by the dashed blue lines above ) , which can be freely moved through the lattice ( `` pulling though condition '' ) .",
    "( whether @xmath27 or @xmath32 has to be used depends on the orientation of the string relative to the lattice  @xcite . )",
    "thus , any string of @xmath27 s is naturally invisible to the parent hamiltonian , as it can be moved away from any patch the parent hamiltonian acts on . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath29-injectivity holds , one can use the equivalence of physical and virtual system on the invariant subspace to prove that such strings are the only non - local objects which can not be detected by the parent hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this yields a natural way to build localized excitations by placing a string of @xmath27 s with open ends on the lattice , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitation - string - pair ] : any such string can only be detected at its endpoints , thereby forming a localized excitation .",
    "these excitations are topological by construction , since by acting on the endpoints alone , we are not able to create such a string . at the same time , using @xmath29-injectivity one can prove that the endpoints can always be detected in a finite system .",
    "thus , we arrive at a second type of topological non - trivial excitations , namely strings of @xmath27 s with an endpoint , @xmath45{figs / dressed - flux - excitation } \\quad .\\ ] ] ( we have followed the notation introduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitation - string - pair ] , where blue dots denote @xmath27 or @xmath32 , and the dashed blue line highlights the string formed . )",
    "again , @xmath46 is an arbitrary @xmath29-invariant tensor which can be used to dress the endpoint with an arbitrary topologically trivial excitation ; under blocking , it can always be assumed to only sit on a single site as shown . again , given periodic boundaries any such string must end in a second anyon ( or more generally the strings emerging from several anyons can fuse as long as the corresponding group elements multiply to the identity ) .",
    "we will denote these excitations as _ magnetic excitations _ with _",
    "flux @xmath47_.      beyond electric and magnetic excitations , it is also possible to combine the two into a so - called _ dyon _ which is of the form @xmath48{figs / dressed - dyonic - excitation}}\\ ] ] note that we have made the choice that the irrep @xmath42 sits on the same leg at which the @xmath27-string ends . while this choice is arbitrary , it is related to any other endpoint , e.g.  one where the string ends on the leg before @xmath42 , by a _ local _ @xmath27-string ,",
    "i.e. , a pair of magnetic excitations , which can be created locally and can thus be accounted for by an appropriate choice of @xmath46 , or even incorporated in @xmath42 .",
    "a general anyonic excitation is thus up to local modifications labeled by a tuple @xmath47 and @xmath37 ; we denote the anyon by @xmath49 , and an anyon string with the two conjugate anyons @xmath49 and @xmath50 at its endpoints by @xmath51 .",
    "let us briefly comment on the braiding statistics of these excitations ; we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "any physical procedure for moving anyons will result in the @xmath27-string being pulled along the path .",
    "thus , a half - exchange of two identical anyons transforms @xmath52{figs / braiding - selfstatistics}\\ ] ] ( where for simplicity we have set @xmath53 , as it transforms trivially ) . straightening the string by pulling it through the right excitation requires to commute @xmath47 with @xmath42 , which gives rise to a phase @xmath54 ; since the resulting two crossing strings are identical to two non - crossing strings , we thus obtain a overall phase of @xmath54 due to the half exchange .",
    "similarly , full exchange of two different anyons @xmath49 and @xmath55 gives rise to two such exchanges , and thus to a mutual statistics @xmath56 for a full exchange .",
    "we therefore see that the strings defined this way indeed exhibit the same statistics as @xmath57 , the quantum double model of @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "it is suggestive to assume that this is the complete picture , and @xmath29-injective peps always exhibit an anyon theory given by the quantum double @xmath57 .",
    "however , it has by now been understood that this is not the case  @xcite : by adding a physical deformation @xmath58 to the tensor , @xmath59 , one can drive the system towards a product state , eventually crossing a phase transition .",
    "e.g. , in the toric code this induces string tension ( or more precisely loop fugacity ) , which eventually leads to the breakdown of topological order  @xcite .",
    "this is directly related to the question as to whether the objects which we have just identified as anyonic excitations on the _ virtual _ level actually describe observable anyons in the thermodynamic limit , and in the limit of large separation between the individual anyons .",
    "while , as we have argued , one can prove  @xcite that the endpoints of a virtual string @xmath51 correspond to observable excitations , this only applies in a finite volume .",
    "however , it is perfectly possible that  depending on the choice of @xmath5new behavior emerges in the thermodynamic limit , which is reflected in a non - trivial environment imposed on a virtual anyon string @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 the separation between the endpoints ) which can prevent it from describing an observable anyonic excitation as @xmath62 .",
    "this can happen in at least two distinct ways : either the environment transforms trivially under @xmath60 , in which case the peps with @xmath60 still describes the ground state , or the environment is orthogonal to @xmath60 , in which case the state has norm zero and is thus unphysical .     tensor networks for detecing * ( a ) * confinement ( the network for the norm of the state evaluates to zero ) and * ( b ) *  condensation ( the network for the overlap with the ground state evaluates to non - zero , both as @xmath62 ) for a general anyon pair of the form eq .",

    "we have studied a number of these phase transitions in more detail ; in the following , we illustrate our findings through a few examples , and refer the reader for a more detailed analysis to ref .",

    "[ fig : tc_ising ] shows the order parameters along line ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , which describes a @xmath490 to toric code transition .",
    "since we have an analytical mapping to the 2d ising model for this line , it can serve as a benchmark , and we find indeed very good agreement with the analytic predictions .",
    "further study suggests the existence of an analytical mapping for the entire @xmath612 plane ; for the @xmath608 plane , the critical exponents still match those of the 2d ising model , though the existence of an exact mapping is unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "the transitions in the @xmath617 plane seem to belong to a different universality class . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : ds - trivial ] shows the transition along the line ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , for which we find critical exponents @xmath651 for the correlations in the fixed point of the transfer operator , and @xmath652 and @xmath653 for the anyon condensation and deconfinement order parameters , respectively ; notably , the critical exponent @xmath278 is different on the two sides of the transition .",
    "we observe that the critical exponents @xmath646 change continously as we move along the transition line in the @xmath654 plane towards the @xmath655 plane , ultimately reaching @xmath656 ; a detailed discussion will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us turn towards the direct toric code  double semion transition , previously only studied with exact diagonalization and on quasi-1d systems  @xcite , whose nature is yet to be resolved .",
    "as one would assume that interactions generally give rise to condensation of excitations , one expects that an interpolation between the two models would typically drive the toric code through some condensation transition , either into a trivial or a more complex phase [ such as the @xmath490 model ] , and from there through another condensation - driven transition to the double semion model , and a direct transition would at least require some fine - tuning of interactions .",
    "we can identify one such fine - tuned transition between the ( @xmath657 ) toric code and double semion phase in our phase diagram in the @xmath612 plane at @xmath658 ; this is a multi - critical point adjacent to all four phases which goes away as one perturbs away from @xmath612 , separating the toric code from the double semion phase .",
    "[ fig:1st2nddstc]a shows the transition through this point along line ( iii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , and we find that it is a second order phase transition , driven by two `` counterpropagating '' condensation and de - condensation transitions , thus preserving the total number of anyons ; like all transitions in that plane , it is again in the 2d ising universality class .",
    "note however that this is a phase transition between two phases with an identical @xmath614 symmetry at the boundary , and therefore corresponds to an spt phase transition at the boundary in the absence of symmetry breaking , and can therefore only be detected by string order parameters rather than conventional local order parameters .",
    "note however that it has been shown that in certain cases string order parameters can be mapped to local order parameters through a duality mapping  @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , there is another way of obtaining a direct phase transition between the @xmath614 toric code and double semion phase , namely by interpolating between the on - site transfer operators @xmath659 of the two fixed point models , rather than the tensors @xmath5 themselves .",
    "since such an interpolation @xmath660 yields a positive semidefinite @xmath661 , we can construct a continuous path @xmath662 of peps tensors by decomposing @xmath663 .",
    "this interpolation yields again a direct transition between the two phases , and a thorough analysis of the order parameters , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1st2nddstc]b , gives compelling evidence that the phase transition is first order .",
    "thus , in order to understand the nature of a generic toric code ",
    "double semion phase transition ( given it can even be realized in a robust way ) requires further study . in this context",
    ", it is an interesting question whether imposing specific symmetries on the system allows one to generically obtain a direct transition between these two phases , rather than requiring fine - tuning of the interactions .",
    "in this paper , we have studied anyon condensation in projected entangled pair state models , and have derived conditions governing the condensation and confinement of anyons . in order to do so",
    ", we have related the behavior of anyons to string order parameters and thus symmetry protected order in the fixed point of the transfer operator , this is , the entanglement spectrum of the system .",
    "we have derived four conditions : two characterize the possible symmetry breaking and spt phases consistent with positivity of the entanglement spectrum , while the other two related these symmetry breaking and spt patterns to the condensation and confinement of anyons .",
    "specifically , we found that there are topological phases which can not be distinguished through their symmetry breaking pattern , but solely through the spt structure of their entanglement spectrum , and which describe phases not related by anyon condensation .",
    "for the case of cyclic groups , this classification allowed to construct all twisted doubles by condensing non - twisted double models .",
    "we have exemplified our discussion with the @xmath0 quantum double , which can give rise to both toric code and double semion phases which form an example of phases with identical symmetry breaking pattern but inequivalent spt order in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "we have also provided numerical results for the phase diagram and the phase transitions of the model . to this end",
    ", we have used that the concepts developed in this paper allow us to measure order parameters for condensation and deconfinement and thus extract critical exponents for the order parameter . in particular , we found that this model can realize direct phase transitions between the toric code and doubled semion models which are not related by anyon condensation , and for which we found both first and second order transitions .",
    "a natural question is the interpretation of symmetry broken and spt phases in the fixed point of the transfer operator in terms of physical properties of the entanglement spectrum and/or edge physics  @xcite : symmetries @xmath664 imply that the entanglement spectrum @xmath665 is block - diagonal , i.e. , it originates from a symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "an additional single - layer symmetry @xmath666 implies that the density operator must live in the trivial irrep sector , while a broken symmetry and the resulting dependence on distant boundary conditions implies the existence of a non - local anomalous term in the entanglement hamiltonian which depends on distant boundaries and encodes a topological superselection rule  @xcite .",
    "the implications of spt order on the entanglement spectrum , on the other hand , are much less clear , and it would be very interesting to identify the features of the entanglement spectrum which would allow to distinguish e.g.  toric code and doubled semion order .    it is likely that our results generalize to the case of non - abelian groups , and beyond that to general matrix product operator symmetries  @xcite .",
    "an obstacle is that the one - to - one correspondence between string order parameters and spts breaks down  @xcite : while it is known that non - abelian spts are still characterized by group cohomology , we have used spt phases to classify the behavior of string order parameters rather than the other way around , and are thus looking for a classification of the behavior of non - abelian string order parameters instead .",
    "let us note , however , that a major simplification might come from the fact that for non - abelian double models , the irrep at the end of a string must be an irrep of its normalizer , so it might well be possible that the problem can be abelianized to an extent which allows to yet again relate it to spt order .",
    "a related question is the generalization of our results to the case of non - hermitian transfer operators , or even peps which encode a corresponding global symmetry in a non - trivial way . in that case",
    ", string order parameters are evaluated between non - identical left and right fixed points , and the analogy to expectation values in physical states , and thus the correspondence of string order parameters with spt phases , breaks down ; for instance , it is not even clear whether the projective symmetry representation for pairs of left and right fixed points must be equal .    finally , the maybe most important question , which goes far beyond the scope of this work , is a rigorous justification of our main technical assumption , namely that the structure of the fixed point space of a transfer operator for a peps in a gapped phase is well described by matrix product operators .",
    "while this is well motivated due to the short - range nature of the correlations in the system , and is well - tested numerically through numerous peps simulations using contraction schemes which model the boundary as an mpo , it has withstood rigorous assessment up to now .",
    "a better understanding of this question would lead to a number of important insights regarding the structure of gapped phases , the nature of the entanglement spectrum , or the convergence of numerical methods , just to name a few .",
