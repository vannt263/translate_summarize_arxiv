    "a precise knowledge of @xmath0 scattering is of interest since it is one of the main reactions involved in the final state of hadronic processes with net strangeness .",
    "it is also interesting by itself because it provides a test of chiral perturbation theory @xcite and other unitarized approaches @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a renewed interest in @xmath0 scattering from lattice qcd , where the main features , like threshold parameters @xcite , scattering phases and resonances @xcite , have already been calculated .",
    "finally , our study of the scalar channel leads to a clear pole for the still controversial @xmath3 , which according to the pdg still needs confirmation .    from the experimental point of view",
    "this processes can not be directly measured and hence the data is plagued by systematic uncertainties .",
    "the data available in the bibliography @xcite are clearly incompatible , furthermore , there are no data close to the threshold .",
    "our goal is to perform an analysis of this scattering process using only analytic constraints and data .",
    "the dispersive integral formalism is model independent and relates the value of the amplitude with an integral over the whole real axis , increasing the precision and giving information even in regions where data are lacking or have large uncertainties .",
    "in addition , it relates different channels among themselves .",
    "moreover it is also useful to constrain threshold and resonance parameters .",
    "our work @xcite is based on forward dispersion relations ( fdr ) .",
    "as they are calculated at @xmath4 we can use this set of equations up to arbitrary energies in the real axis , providing a set of simple but powerful constraints for the fits .",
    "we consider two independent amplitudes , one symmetric and one antisymmetric under the @xmath5 exchange that cover the isospin basis @xmath6 and @xmath7 .. the symmetric has one subtraction and can be written as    @xmath8 , \\label{eq : fdrtsym}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast the antisymmetric one does not require subtractions :    @xmath10    we also include in our analysis 3 sum rules for threshold parameters ( scattering lengths and slopes ) in order to obtain the best possible result in this region , where there are no data .",
    "these integral equations allow us to obtain a set of precise scattering lengths .",
    "there can be observed @xcite how this analysis leads to a set of threshold parameters compatible with the experimental measurements of the dirac collaboration @xcite .",
    "there exists previous dispersive analysis @xcite that obtains the phase shifts of the scalar and vectorial channels by using roy - steiner equations ( rs ) . but",
    "these equations can only be applied in the low energy region ( @xmath11 gev ) .",
    "the approach used in this work follows the same steps as previous works done by our group for @xmath12 scattering @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) we first obtain simple fits for each partial wave independently , called unconstrained fits to data ( ufd ) , without including any model description .",
    "( 2 ) we check the fulfillment of the dispersion relations to observe if there are some inconsistent data points that do not satisfy it . ( 3 ) we finally impose this integral equations to obtain the final constrained fits to data ( cfd ) , where all the partial waves are related through the fdr and the sum rules .",
