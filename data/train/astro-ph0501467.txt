    "thermal emission from neutron stars ( nss ) may potentially be used to directly measure the ns surface magnetic field , temperature , and composition , achieve a more complete understanding of the evolution of the nss , and constrain the properties of matter and physical processes under extreme conditions .",
    "it was realized long ago that a ns atmosphere model should properly include a strong magnetic field and partial ionization ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for an early review ) .",
    "models of _ fully ionized _",
    "ns atmospheres with strong magnetic fields were constructed by several research groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the most recent papers highlighted the effects that may be important for the atmospheres of magnetars : the ion cyclotron feature @xcite and vacuum polarization effects , including a conversion of the normal modes of radiation propagating in the magnetized atmosphere @xcite .",
    "early considerations of _ partial ionization _ in the magnetized ns atmospheres ( @xcite ; also reviewed briefly by @xcite ) were not very reliable because of oversimplified treatments of atomic physics and nonideal plasma effects in strong magnetic fields . at the typical ns atmosphere parameters , the effects of thermal motion of the bound species are important .",
    "in the 1990s , binding energies and radiative transition rates with allowance for the motion effects in strong magnetic fields have been calculated for the h atom @xcite .",
    "recently these atomic data have been implemented in calculations of thermodynamic functions @xcite , radiative opacities @xcite , and spectra @xcite of the partially ionized h atmospheres of the nss .",
    "some results have been presented at the previous cospar meeting @xcite .",
    "now our atmosphere model has been complemented by the effects of the bound states on the polarization properties of the strongly magnetized plasma @xcite .",
    "below we briefly summarize the results that allow us to calculate realistic x - ray spectra of thermal radiation from hydrogen ns atmospheres with magnetic fields @xmath0  g and effective temperatures @xmath1  k , and outline the problems that remain to be addressed at other atmospheric parameters and compositions .",
    "we use the equation of state ( eos ) for h in strong magnetic fields @xcite based on the free - energy minimization method , which ensures the thermodynamic consistency and allows one to determine number fractions of chemical species , required for opacity calculations .",
    "the model takes into account all available theoretical results on the moving h atoms and nonideal coulomb plasmas in the magnetic fields .",
    "this eos has been tabulated and employed for calculation of opacities for astrophysical use @xcite .",
    "=    it is well known that under typical conditions ( e.g. , far from the resonances ) radiation propagates in a magnetized plasma in the form of two normal modes , called the extraordinary ( x ) and the ordinary ( o ) .",
    "the opacity in the mode @xmath2 ( @xmath3x , o ) depends on the photon frequency @xmath4 , magnetic field @xmath5 , density @xmath6 , temperature @xmath7 , and the angle @xmath8 between the magnetic field and propagation direction .",
    "it can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the cyclic coordinates of the polarization vectors of the normal modes , and the quantities @xmath12 ( @xmath11 ) do not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite calculated @xmath13 and evaluated @xmath14 using the polarization vectors of the normal modes in the fully ionized plasma , such a calculation ( dubbed `` hybrid '' in @xcite ) was employed in our previous model of partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres of the nss with strong magnetic fields @xcite .    in the new model @xcite , we take into account the influence of the bound species on the polarization vectors of the normal modes , making use of the kramers - kronig relation between the imaginary and real parts of the plasma polarizability .",
    "thus the calculation of the polarization vectors and opacities of the normal modes has become self - consistent .",
    "the calculations of thermal spectra of the nss show that such self - consistent treatment is necessary if the number fraction of the bound states exceeds several percent . in fig .",
    "[ fig - ang13_0 ] we compare radiative opacities calculated with and without allowance for the bound species for one particular set of plasma parameters , typical near the radiative surface of a moderately cool neutron star with magnetic field @xmath15  g , for two @xmath8 values . in the case shown in the figure , the neutral fraction is 70% , thus the self - consistent treatment of the opacities is important .",
    "the constructed atmosphere models allow us to calculate realistic spectra of thermal x - ray radiation from h atmospheres of the nss with @xmath16 and @xmath1  k. examples of these spectra are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there remain the following unsolved problems that prevent us from making similarly reliable calculations beyond these limits .",
    "although the h eos and opacities have been calculated for @xmath5 up to @xmath17  g and implemented in the atmosphere model @xcite , the calculated spectra at @xmath18  g depend on the adopted model of mode conversion due to the vacuum resonance and on description of propagation of photons with frequencies below the plasma frequency . both these problems have not been definitely solved .",
    "their solution is also important for modeling the low - frequency ( uv and optical ) tail of the spectrum .",
    "\\2 . at lower @xmath7 or higher @xmath5 ,",
    "h atoms recombine in h@xmath19 molecules and eventually form the condensed phase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "corresponding quantum - mechanical data are very incomplete .",
    "\\3 . at @xmath20  g ,",
    "transition rates of the moving h atom have not been calculated previously because of their complexity .",
    "the first calculation of the energy spectrum appropriate in this range of @xmath5 has been published when the present paper was in preparation @xcite .",
    "\\4 . at present",
    "it is not possible to calculate accurate atmospheric spectra at @xmath21  g for chemical elements other than hydrogen , because of the importance of the effects of finite nuclear mass in the strong field regime .",
    "apart from the h atom , these effects have been calculated only for the he atom _ at rest _",
    "@xcite and for the he@xmath22 ion ( at only one value of @xmath5 , @xcite ) .",
    "a more rigorous treatment of radiative transfer in the atmosphere requires solving the transfer equations of the stokes parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the cases of fully ionized atmospheres ) .",
    "however , since the nonorthogonal features of the modes due to neutral species are diminished by the center - of - mass motion , the effect is expected to be small .    finally , let us note that the atmosphere model presented here , together with a model of radiation from the condensed magnetic surface @xcite , has been successfully used for fitting the spectrum of the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5@xmath233754 @xcite",
