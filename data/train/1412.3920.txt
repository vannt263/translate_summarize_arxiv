    "<S> we present a study of the variation of total energies and excitation energies along a range - separated adiabatic connection . </S>",
    "<S> this connection links the non - interacting kohn  sham electronic system to the physical interacting system by progressively switching on the electron  </S>",
    "<S> electron interactions whilst simultaneously adjusting a one - electron effective potential so as to keep the ground - state density constant . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions are introduced in a range - dependent manner , first introducing predominantly long - range , and then all - range , interactions as the physical system is approached , as opposed to the conventional adiabatic connection where the interactions are introduced by globally scaling the standard coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> reference data are reported for the he and be atoms and the h@xmath0 molecule , obtained by calculating the short - range effective potential at the full configuration - interaction level using lieb s legendre - transform approach . as the strength of the electron  </S>",
    "<S> electron interactions increases , the excitation energies , calculated for the partially interacting systems along the adiabatic connection , offer increasingly accurate approximations to the exact excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the excitation energies calculated at an intermediate point of the adiabatic connection are much better approximations to the exact excitation energies than are the corresponding kohn  sham excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly evident in situations involving strong static correlation effects and states with multiple excitation character , such as the dissociating h@xmath0 molecule . </S>",
    "<S> these results highlight the utility of long - range interacting reference systems as a starting point for the calculation of excitation energies and are of interest for developing and analyzing practical approximate range - separated density - functional methodologies . </S>"
