    "the soft ( @xmath12kev ) diffuse x - ray background was a relatively early discovery of x - ray astronomy ( see review by @xcite ) . unlike the diffuse hard x - ray ( @xmath13kev ) background , whose isotropy demonstrated it was dominated by extragalactic sources , the origin of soft component was and is more uncertain .",
    "while at high galactic latitudes extragalactic emission contributes to the observed flux , at lower latitudes the emission must be local to the galaxy since at energies of 3/4 kev , absorption is significant ( one optical depth is only n@xmath14@xmath2 ) . despite this , both the wisconsin m band @xcite and the rosat 3/4 kev @xcite surveys showed surprisingly little latitude dependence away from the galactic bulge .",
    "it is now known that at high latitudes , where n@xmath15  is generally less than @xmath16@xmath2 , @xmath17% of the 3/4 kev emission is due to agn , and from the xqc sounding rocket flight we know that at least 42% of the high - latitude flux must be due to oxygen emission lines coming from @xmath18  @xcite although it is not known if these are within the galaxy or in the halo .",
    "the situation in the galactic plane is more confusing .",
    "dwarf m stars must contribute some of the 3/4 kev emission @xcite , but at least 50% of the emission is of unknown origin @xcite .",
    "ovii  and oviii  contribute most of the line emission in the 3/4 kev band , although the fraction in lines versus continuum remains uncertain .",
    "oxygen s dominance is due both to its large cosmic abundance ( compared to other metals ) , and its strong emission lines at 0.57 kev ( the ovii  triplet from @xmath19 ) and 0.65 kev ( the oviii  ly@xmath20  transition ) .",
    "absorption limits the observed in - plane 3/4 kev emission to regions within 1 - 2 kpc ( assuming @xmath21@xmath5  in the galaxy ) .",
    "some of the 3/4 kev emission must be from the same source as the 1/4 kev x - ray background , which has been attributed to a combination of emission from a `` local hot bubble '' ( lhb ) @xcite and charge exchange from solar wind ions ( hereafter swcx ) @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the x - rays must be truly `` local '' , originating within @xmath22pc in the former case or within the solar system in the latter .    to distinguish between the `` local '' 3/4 kev x - ray emission and the more distant galactic and halo components , we used _",
    "suzaku_to observe the nearby molecular cloud mbm12 ( lynds 1457 ) , along with a nearby `` blank - sky''position not occulted by the cloud .",
    "earlier observations of mbm12 obtained with rosat @xcite(smv93 ) and _ chandra_@xcite had low spectral resolution ( rosat ) or were strongly affected by high background due to solar flares ( _ chandra _ ) .",
    "our hope with this observation was to use _ suzaku _ s low background , good spectral resolution , and sizable effective area @xmath23  solid angle product to measure the components of both the local and more distant contributors to the 3/4 kev emission .",
    "as described in @xcite , the true distance to mbm12 is uncertain , with estimates ranging from @xmath24pc to @xmath25pc .",
    "our goal , however , is only to use mbm12 as a curtain that separates local components such as the lhb and swcx from more distant components such as a hot halo or extragalactic emission .",
    "it seems unlikely there is a significant component to the soft x - ray emission that is beyond the lhb but in front of mbm12 , so the distance uncertainty is not particularly important to this analysis . the total column density due to the mbm12 cloud is also somewhat uncertain . we follow @xcite , who argued for n@xmath26@xmath2  as a reasonable value for the densest region of mbm12 . although the _ suzaku_xis1 has more than four times the field of view of the _ chandra_acis - s3 ( @xmath27  versus @xmath28 ) , this is of similar size to the densest part of mbm12 and so we expect a similar total column density . for the ovii  and oviii  lines most relevant to our analysis the optical depths for this column density are 3.5 and 2.4 , respectively .",
    "in addition , with a nearby off - cloud measurement , we will be able to directly determine the distant contribution and estimate its effect on the on - cloud emission .",
    "rosat observations were only able to put a @xmath29  upper limit of 270 counts s@xmath3sr@xmath3  on the 3/4 kev emission seen towards mbm12 ( smv93)arcmin@xmath30 .",
    "smv93 fit a `` standard '' @xmath31k collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) lhb model @xcite assuming a pathlength of @xmath32pc , and found a good match to the observed 1/4 kev emission with an emission measure of @xmath33@xmath11pc .",
    "this model generates only @xmath34 counts s@xmath3sr@xmath3  in the 3/4 kev band , primarily due to @xmath35ph@xmath2s@xmath3sr@xmath3 ( hereafter lu , for `` line units '' ) generated by the oviitriplet ( based on the atomdb v1.3.1 atomic database ) .",
    "however , the rosat pspc had little spectral resolution in this band and could not separate the ovii  and oviii  lines from the background continuum , and possible fe l line emission .",
    "@xcite used the _",
    "chandra_acis instrument to redo the smv93 observations with higher spectral and spatial resolution .",
    "the results were affected by a large solar flare during part of the observation , which likely led to increased emission from swcx ( see @xcitefor more details on swcx ) .",
    "@xcite detected strong ovii  and oviii  emission lines with surface brightnesses of @xmath36  and @xmath37lu respectively , much larger than the prediction from smv93 .",
    "the oviii  emission itself was also unexpected , as @xcite  showed that it can not come from any of the standard lhb models , either equilibrium or strongly recombining .",
    "they suggested that the observed oviii emission was from the swcx , although this could not be proven .",
    "the molecular cloud mbm12 ( lynds 1457 ) was observed by _",
    "suzaku_on february 3 - 6 , 2006 for a total of 231 ksec .",
    "the nominal pointing position was ( ra , dec ) = @xmath38  ( j2000 ) ( @xmath39 ) , corresponding to the most infrared - luminous and thus densest portion of the molecular cloud . immediately thereafter ( on february 6 - 8 , 2006 ) an `` off - cloud '' pointing was obtained towards @xmath40(j2000 ) ( @xmath41 , a position @xmath42  distant from the cloud , for 168 ksec .",
    "we present data primarily from the xis instrument @xcite , using the back - illuminated ccd xis1 which has the largest effective area at energies below 1 kev .",
    "the two fields of view are shown in figure  [ fig : fov_iras100 ] , overplotted on the iras 100@xmath43 m image .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f1.ps",
    "we used version 0.7 of the _ suzaku_data processing pipeline for our base dataset .",
    "the cleaned v0.7 data are by default filtered to exclude times within 436 seconds of _ suzaku_passing through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , and when _ suzaku _",
    "s line of sight is elevated above the earth s limb by less than @xmath44 , or is less than @xmath45  from the bright - earth terminator .",
    "we decided to expand this to exclude events with earth - limb elevation angle less than @xmath46 , as there were some excess events in the 0.5 - 0.6 kev band in the @xmath47  range .",
    "finally , flaring pixels were removed using the cleansis  tool with the default v0.7 parameters .",
    "although these are a small fraction of the total number of pixels on the ccd , they contribute a sizable background . in the case of the on - cloud data for xis1 , just 1055 flickering pixels ( out of @xmath48total pixels ) contributed @xmath49  of the total counts .",
    "the bright intermediate polar xy ari was serendipitously included in the on - cloud observations ; this source will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "xy ari is sufficiently highly absorbed @xcite that no photons below 1 kev are expected from the source .",
    "however , a smoothed image of the 0.4 - 1.0 kev band ( see figure  [ fig : image][left ] ) shows low - energy emission from xy ari , likely due to the tail of the ccd response curve .",
    "we therefore excluded a @xmath50  radius region around xy ari ( marked with a red circle in figure  [ fig : image][left ] ) in order to reduce this background .",
    "this had the effect of substantially reducing the total background at all energies while excluding only a small fraction of the total @xmath27  field .",
    "in addition , there were two other weaker sources found which were also previously found in the _ chandra_observation of mbm12 .",
    "these are marked in figure  [ fig : image][left ] with a @xmath51  radius blue circle ( 02:55:48 , + 19:29:12 , j2000 ) and a white circle ( 02:55:51 , + 19:26:21 , j2000 ) . both had hard spectra with no significant flux below 1 kev in either the _ suzaku_or _",

    "we leave analysis of these sources for a future paper , and concentrate on the diffuse soft x - ray emission .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f2a.ps ( 80mm,80mm)f2b.ps      as the goal of the observation was to extract the soft x - ray background , which fills the field of view , other background components can not be estimated directly from the observation .",
    "therefore our first focus was on understanding the importance of the three major background components : particle contamination , scattered solar x - rays , and solar wind charge exchange .",
    "we did not exclude the corners of the detectors which contained the onboard calibration sources in our analysis , but instead fit these lines ( which are all @xmath52kev ) as part of our source and background models .      _",
    "suzaku_is in a low - earth orbit , so it is significantly shielded from the particle background that strongly affects _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra_. the effectiveness of this shielding is dependent upon the `` cut - off rigidity '' ( cor ) of the earth s magnetic field , which varies as _ suzaku_traverses its orbit . during times with larger cor values , fewer particles are able to penetrate to the satellite and to the xis detectors .",
    "we considered using the default value ( cor@xmath53gv ) but finally chose to use a stronger constraint ( cor@xmath54gv ) for both observations , as the lowest background was desired .",
    "this tighter constraint eliminates 27% ( 28.5 ksec ) of the total on - cloud observation time but 35% of all the xis1 counts . after this cut , we were left with 71.7 ksec of `` good '' time for the on - cloud observation and 51.85 ksec for the off - cloud pointing .",
    "although it is reduced by the earth s magnetic field , _",
    "suzaku_still has a noticeable particle background .",
    "fortunately , we can estimate the background level quite accurately as a part of most observations is spent observing the earth at night , and these data are a good proxy for the pure particle background .",
    "phenomena such as aurorae have been observed to contribute x - rays to the earth s night sky @xcite , but these processes tend to be transient and thus are easily removed from the data .",
    "we used @xmath55ksec of night earth observations from the swg phase of the mission .",
    "the data were filtered to remove flares , and to ensure that _ suzaku _ s line - of - sight elevation from the earth - limb was less than @xmath56 while observing the dark earth .",
    "we also required the same cut - off rigidity constraint ( cor@xmath54gv ) as used for the on- and off - cloud observations when extracting the particle background spectrum .",
    "as _ suzaku_orbits the earth maintaining a fixed pointing , the column density of atmosphere along the look direction varies rapidly .",
    "solar x - rays can scatter off the atmosphere into the telescope , either via thompson scattering or by fluorescence @xcite .",
    "fluorescence of oxygen atoms and molecules is our greatest concern , as it would give rise to emission lines around 0.54 kev which could blend with the ovii  line .",
    "we modeled the earth s atmosphere using the nrlmsise-00 empirical model @xcite , and combined this with the _ suzaku_orbital parameters to calculate the total solar - illuminated column density of oxygen atoms and o@xmath57  molecules as a function of time .",
    "we then extracted the count rate as a function of time in the 0.4 - 1.0 kev band and compared this to the oxygen column density n@xmath58 . in figure",
    "[ fig : atmo_uncl ] we show the correlation plot for the uncleaned data .",
    "when the illuminated atmospheric n@xmath58  exceeds @xmath59@xmath2 , the count rate rises sharply due to scattered solar x - rays .",
    "we fit the data with n@xmath58  between @xmath60@xmath2  to a linear model and found that they are well described by the function @xmath61n@xmath58cts / s . in figure",
    "[ fig : atmo_cl ] we show the same plot ( with a linear abscissa ) after the standard filters are applied .",
    "all the lines of sight with column densities above @xmath62@xmath2  have been eliminated ( at least for this observation ) by the requirements that the look direction be elevated by at least @xmath46  and at least @xmath45  away from the bright earth terminator . figure  [ fig : atmo_cl ] shows that most times have either negligible oxygen column or n@xmath63@xmath2 .",
    "applying our linear fit , we see that the integrated contamination due to fluorescent oxygen is less than @xmath64cts / s .",
    "a similar result holds for the off - cloud observation as well .",
    "we therefore expect that the scattered solar x - ray contribution to our data is negligible .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f3.ps    ( 80mm,80mm)f4.ps      diffuse soft x - ray emission can also be generated by ions in the solar wind interacting with neutral interplanetary or geocoronal material .",
    "however , the appearance and strength of emission lines emitted by swcx is poorly characterized .",
    "it is expected that the density , velocity , and ionization balance of the solar wind should correlate with the variable swcx contribution , which is largely from the geocorona , but there may also be a more nearly constant component of the swcx emission from interplanetary space .",
    "figure  [ fig : sw_params ] shows some of the relevant values for the two _ suzaku_observations and , for comparison , during an instance of strong swcx emission seen by _ xmm - newton_.    @xcite analyzed an _ xmm - newton_observation of the hubble deep field north that showed substantial swcx emission .",
    "that observation occurred during a period characterized by a strong solar proton flux ( in only a few percent of observations are stronger fluxes seen ) , as well as high o@xmath65/o@xmath66 , but low o@xmath67/o@xmath65 .",
    "the proton speed was low , @xmath68 kms@xmath3 .",
    "enhanced ovii ( @xmath69lu ) and ( despite the low o@xmath67/o@xmath65  ratio ) oviii ( @xmath70lu ) emission was seen during this observation , along with a number of other species .",
    "in contrast , our _ suzaku_observations were done at a time characterized by a moderate proton flux in the solar wind , with the exception of one short period of the on - cloud observation .",
    "the o@xmath65/o@xmath66 ratio during both observations was close to the mean ratio for the solar wind .",
    "the proton speed during both _",
    "suzaku_observations was exceptionally low , typically @xmath71 kms@xmath3 , which is seen in only a few percent of observations .",
    "nonetheless , there were some similarities in the solar wind parameters during the _ xmm - newton_observation that showed strong swcx contamination and our _ suzaku_observations .",
    "in both , the solar wind was slow and dense . however , the peak proton flux during the _",
    "suzaku_observations was less than half the proton flux responsible for the swcx emission in the _ xmm - newton_observation , and the mean proton flux is even lower .",
    "further , the _ xmm - newton_line of sight observed through the densest portion of the earth s magnetosheath , whereas the _ suzaku_observations are through the flanks of the magnetosheath , thus further reducing the target neutrals with which the solar wind produces the x - ray emission .",
    "unfortunately , our understanding of how the solar wind characteristics , satellite orbits , and observing directions interact to generate observed swcx emission is still quite limited .",
    "nonetheless , the combination of the solar wind strength and the look direction , as well as the fact that the ion ratios are close to the mean values , suggests that whatever the swcx surface brightness was during our _ suzaku_observations , it is typical for observations of the diffuse soft x - ray background .",

    "had occurred .",
    "unfortunately , however , the time- and space - varying contamination layer which was discovered early in the mission has complicated observations at low energies @xcite .",
    "we calculated the xis detector effective area using the tool xissimarfgen , which includes both the time and spatial effects of the contamination layer .",
    "we assumed a field - filling source , and used a detector mask which removed the bad pixel regions , along with the region excluded due to the bright source xy ari .",
    "the model of the contamination layer is based on in - flight observations and has its own uncertainties . combining these",
    "with other known sources of systematic error , we estimate that at 0.6 kev there is a @xmath72% systematic error on the final effective area@xmath23solid angle product , in addition to the given statistical errors .",
    "although mbm12 absorbs almost all distant emission below 0.7 kev , we can not say if the foreground low energy emission is local to the solar system or tens of parsecs away . our first goal , however , is to simply model the spectrum seen towards mbm12 since this is likely the darkest high latitude line of sight in the galaxy at soft x - ray energies .",
    "the data clearly showed a feature near 0.56 kev , so we began by simply fitting a linear continuum plus a gaussian to the observed count rates ( with no background subtraction ) for the on - cloud data on xis1 between 0.4 - 1.0 kev in pi channels .",

    "if both oxygen lines are from an unabsorbed plasma in cie , the oviii / ovii ratio ( @xmath114 ) implies @xmath115k . at this temperature ,",
    "the predicted emission measure is @xmath116@xmath11pc using atomdb v1.3.1 emissivities @xcite .",
    "if , as is more likely , the plasma is behind the galactic hydrogen layer ( @xmath117@xmath2 ) , then the unabsorbed oviii / ovii ratio would be @xmath118 . in this case , @xmath119k and the emission measure is @xmath120@xmath11pc . in either case ,",
    "our results consistent with previous measurements of distant hot halo gas .",
    "however , our result does not touch on the question of whether the halo has one @xcite or two @xcite dominant temperatures ; further _ suzaku_observations will be necessary to address this question .",
    "the line at 0.876 kev is a mystery , although we stress it is at best a @xmath121  detection .",
    "between 0.7 - 1.3 kev , the strongest emission lines in a collisional plasma are typically from neon or iron .",
    "the closest strong neon line to 0.876 kev is the neix forbidden line , but this would require a 5% gain error in the xis1 .",
    "the oxygen lines at lower energies show @xmath122  gain shift , and the calibration lines at higher energies ( see table  [ tab : bglines ] ) have less than 1% gain shift .",
    "the strongest iron lines near this energy are from @xmath123  transitions in fe xviii , but any identification with an fe line is problematic since many other lines of fexviii  ( such as the @xmath124  line at 0.775 kev ) would also be expected . in particular , the 2@xmath80  upper limit on the fexvii 0.826 kev line of 0.19 lu strongly limits any fe line identification for the line at 0.876 kev .",
    "it is possible it is an as - yet unidentified weak instrumental line , although this raises the question of why it is not present in the on - cloud data .",
    "intriguingly , the lyman limit for oviii  is 0.8704 kev , so it is possible that this is not a line , but rather a recombination edge resulting from cool electrons interacting with o@xmath67  ions .",
    "if so , we wonder at the origin of the o@xmath67  ions  are they local to the solar system due to a sudden change in the solar wind during the off - cloud observation , or from a distant recombining plasma ? as more data from ace and _ suzaku_becomes available",
    ", we may be able to answer this question .",
