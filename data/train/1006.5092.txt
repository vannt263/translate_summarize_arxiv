    "srinivasa ramanujan ( 18871920 ) , native to india , was an extraordinary mathematician .",
    "a child prodigy , he was largely self - educated .",
    "when he was 16 , he found an 1856 book by g. s. carr @xcite , that listed theorems and formulas and some short proofs . using this tutorial textbook , packed with facts from advanced calculus , geometry , and classical analysis , as a guide , ramanujan taught himself mathematics , and by the age of 17 was engaged in deep mathematical research , studying bernoulli numbers and divergent series and calculating the euler - mascheroni constant to 15 decimal places .",
    "after several unsuccessful attempts to have his work appreciated by other mathematicians , he wrote to g. h. hardy , who recognized his genius and invited him to study with him at cambridge .",
    "ramanujan , a devout brahmin , at first refused to travel to a foreign country , but relented when the family goddess namagiri appeared to his mother in a dream commanding her not to prevent his departure .",
    "ramanujan was tutored by , and collaborated with , hardy for almost five years beginning in 1914 .",
    "they published seven joint papers in varous journals @xcite .",
    "their brilliant guest made a deep impression on hardy and littlewood , who compared him to jacobi and euler .",
    "hardy considered that his most important mathematical achievement was the discovery of ramanujan .",
    "ramanujan was in poor health and was hospitalized for a long time because of a non - diagnosed illness .",
    "he returned in poor health to india in 1919 , and died soon after at the age of 32 .",
    "a modern analysis of his medical records has indicated that he may have been suffering from a form of hepatitis .",
    "it is beyond our competence to evaluate the significance of ramanujan s mathematical genius . in the literature",
    ", he is sometimes mentioned in the company of other great mathematicians such as gauss , jacobi , and euler .",
    "ramanujan recorded most of his work in notebooks containing thousands of mathematical formulas and results . in a series of books , published by springer - verlag from 1985 through 1998 @xcite@xcite",
    ", b. berndt carefully analyzed these notebooks , giving proofs for the results that ramanujan had stated without proof .",
    "other work by ramanujan is contained in the so - called lost notebook @xcite and in some loose papers .",
    "berndt s analysis and book - writing project has required an enormous amount of effort and scientific detective work , for which he has received grateful acknowledgment from the mathematical community .",
    "in particular , in 1996 he received the steele prize for mathematical exposition , with a citation @xcite that reads , in part , `` in an impressive scholarly accomplishment spread out over 20 years , berndt has provided a readable and complete account of the notebooks , making them accessible to other mathematicians .",
    "ramanujan s enigmatic , unproved formulas are now readily available , together with context and explication , often after the most intense and clever research efforts on berndt s part . ''    during the past ninety years that have passed since ramanujan s death , his influence on several areas of mathematics such as number theory , combinatorics , and mathematical analysis has been significant and continues to be so .      for about twenty - five years",
    "the present authors had an active collaboration with the late m. k. vamanamurthy , who died in 2009 .",
    "we referred to our research group as avv , after the initials of our last names .",
    "our joint research dealt with geometric function theory , more precisely quasiconformal mapping theory . an important aspect of our work dealt with conformal invariants , usually expressed in terms of special functions such as the euler gamma function , hypergeometric functions , complete elliptic integrals , and elliptic functions .    by a lucky chance we discovered the survey of askey @xcite and berndt s series of books on ramanujan s notebooks @xcite@xcite , where we found valuable pieces of information .",
    "what interested us most was ramanujan s work on the gamma and hypergeometric functions and modular equations .",
    "we also had access to a preprint version of @xcite , which dealt with some of ramanujan s theories .",

    "we have written several surveys on our avv research .",
    "in @xcite we provided an overview of the known results , along with several new ones , and formulated a long list of open problems , including problems about the gamma function .",
    "next , in @xcite , we outlined some of our earlier results and suggested that known inequalities and identities for the complete elliptic integral @xmath0 might hold for @xmath1 with @xmath2 close to @xmath3 where @xmath1 stands for the gaussian hypergeometric function ( see @xcite , @xcite and ( [ eq : kolmas ] ) below ) .",
    "it turned out that some of these ideas bore fruit , perhaps more than we had anticipated , in the following years , and the results are surveyed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several of our research topics that were inspired by ramanujan s work are the euler - mascheroni constant , the euler gamma function , volumes of unit balls in euclidean n - space , approximation of the gaussian hypergeometric function @xmath4 , approximation of the perimeter of an ellipse , and the study of generalized modular equations .",
    "some of the most recent results , motivated by avv work , include the papers authored by x.  zhang , g. wang , v. heikkala ,  .",
    "baricz , e. a. karatsuba , h. alzer , and others .",
    "the surveys @xcite and @xcite were written before our book @xcite , which summarizes most of our work , whereas the surveys @xcite and @xcite were written after the publication of @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present survey is to give a modified version of @xcite , with an attempt to provide an overview of the most recent work on this subject matter .    while we where working on the book @xcite , we became acquainted with the work of s .-",
    "qiu , who subsequently visited each of the avv team members at our respective home universities .",
