    "cuprate materials have proven a fertile ground for the study of strong electronic correlations and quantum magnetism .",
    "spectroscopic techniques are powerful tools to obtain information about these properties , since they provide direct information on the electronic and magnetic elementary excitations , which are related to the energy spectra , the crystal structure , and so on . among the spectroscopic techniques used to probe magnetic excitations in cuprates ,",
    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) has gained much interest because of the recent increases in energy and momentum resolution , due to the enhanced brilliance of synchrotron x - ray sources and the advances in instrumentations .",
    "this has placed rixs at the forefront in the study of the momentum dependent electronic and magnetic responses over a wide energy range.@xcite in the rixs process , x - ray radiation is inelastically scattered by the matter and the change in energy , momentum and polarization can be related to intrinsic excitations in the material .",
    "this process is resonant because the energy of an incoming photon is tuned to match an element absorption edge , thus allowing a large enhancement of the scattered intensity . in this way",
    "the x - ray photons can couple to charge , spin and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite    in the context of the cuprates , it is by now well - established that rixs can detect the momentum dependence of charge excitations that are related to the electrons and holes in the @xmath3 shell,@xcite , but it has also been proved , both experimentally and theoretically , that rixs is sensitive to the magnetic excitations of cuprates .      in the magnetic sector , rixs can both create single and double spin flip excitations , corresponding to single- and bi - magnon excitations in ordered heisenberg antiferromagnets ( afm ) . moreover , it has been also predicted that three - magnon scatterings contribute substantially to the magnetic spectral weight,@xcite whereas single - magnon excitations were observed in direct rixs experiments at the cu l@xmath4 edge on a thin film of la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , @xcite and also on small crystals of sr@xmath5cuo@xmath5cl@xmath5.@xcite    from a theoretical point of view , when the magnetic moment lies in the plane of the @xmath7 orbital , direct spin - flip scattering in cuprates is allowed for symmetry reasons .",
    "thus , at least for this class of materials , l - edge rixs can be placed on the same footing as neutron scattering , and both are related to the two - spin dynamical correlation function.@xcite    at the cu k - edge , the rixs process is indirect and single - magnon scattering is forbidden . in this case ,",
    "magnetic excitations turn out to be due to bi - magnon , as observed in insulating and doped la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 and nd@xmath5cuo@xmath6.@xcite subsequently , excitations with a bi - magnon - like dispersion have been observed in cuprates with high - resolution l - edge rixs,@xcite and m - edge rixs.@xcite this makes rixs thus complementary to optical raman scattering , which also measures the bi - magnon , but only at zero momentum transfer.@xcite .    the microscopic mechanism by which the bi - magnons couple to the intermediate state core - hole in cu k - edge rixs is by the core - hole locally modifying the superexchange constant .",
    "this leads to the measurement of a four - spin correlation function that can be derived in detail via the ultrashort core - hole lifetime ( ucl ) expansion.@xcite this approach yields a momentum dependence of the cross section in agreement with experiments on undoped cuprates in the n@xmath10el state .",
    "in particular it reproduces the lack of intensity at @xmath11=(0,0 ) and ( @xmath12).@xcite at the cu l- and m - edges , the coupling mechanism to bi - magnon excitations is similar , resulting in the same cross section to lowest order in the perturbing effective potential between the spin and the core - hole , due to the fact that the superexchange in the intermediate state is , in this case , not just altered but completely blocked locally.@xcite    despite the success in describing undoped cuprates , the doping dependence of both single- and multi - magnon measured by rixs is rather little unexplored , however with the first data available showing intriguing behavior . for k - edge measurements on la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6",
    ", the intensity of the spectral features is found to generally decrease as @xmath13 increases.@xcite the persistence of the highest peak at @xmath14 , located around 500 mev , for doping values @xmath13 = 0.07 , well into the superconducting phase , shows that this excitation survives even if long - range magnetic order is absent , as long as significant short - range magnetic correlations are present , which is well - known to be the case in the superconducting state of lsco.@xcite the evolution upon doping observed in l - edge rixs measurements on lsco is even more captivating , showing the existence of a high energy ",
    "undoped \" branch in addition to the lower - energy dispersive features measured in neutron scattering , which can be related to the presence of a stripe liquid@xcite .      in this paper",
    "we analyze the doping dependence of magnetic rixs in cuprates , and particularly we explore the evolution of the magnetic excitations with doping .",
    "we focus on 1d systems because i ) strong quantum fluctuations are present , that maximally effect the magnetic ordering , ii ) the existence of an exact theoretical results for magnetic excitations in the undoped 1d heisenberg afm , formulated in the spinon language , provides a stringent reference test for our numerical spectra , iii ) the sampling of the brillouin zone ( bz ) is much more dense than in the 2d case , and iv ) the results are directly relevant for rixs on 1d cuprates , such as sr@xmath5cuo@xmath4 , where experiments probing the low - energy magnetic excitations are entirely feasible.@xcite these 1d spin liquid states may be relevant to the proposed stripe liquid behavior in high - temperature superconductors .    we present numerical calculations of different - time two - spin ( ts ) and four - spin ( fs ) correlation functions , evaluated on 22 sites chain for the heisenberg model and 16 sites chain for the @xmath0 model , in the low doping regime with a doping concentration up to 1/8 .",
    "even if the analysis is limited by the finite length of the system , one can extract relevant information about the intensity and the dispersion of the magnetic features by quantitative analysis of total spectral weight ( @xmath15 ) , and its first moment ( @xmath16 ) , corresponding to the average energy peak position .",
    "besides , the higher energy features are expected to be less affected by finite size effects .",
    "we firstly consider the undoped case assuming a description based on the nearest - neighbour afm heisenberg model on a chain .",
    "it turns out that both ts and fs correlation functions detect two - spinon excitations , with a spectral weight that is concentrated at the lower boundary of the continuum of excitations .",
    "we point out that ts and fs access excitations belonging to orthogonal subspaces , having total spin s=1 and s=0 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we recover crucial differences about momentum dispersion and selection rules : ts is peaked at @xmath1 where fs vanishes , whereas the latter is peaked at @xmath2 .",
    "this result highlights the different length - scale between the ts and the fs excitation .",
    "the latter has a characteristic length - scale of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the lattice spacing , as two ( neighboring ) exchange bonds are broken in the intermediate state .",
    "this shifts the maximum from @xmath1 towards @xmath19 .",
    "these results are consistent with recent bethe ansatz calculations  @xcite .",
    "we subsequently study the spectral evolution upon doping , by using the same approach on a @xmath0 chain containing mobile holes .",
    "the magnetic response is found to soften and broaden as a function of the doping concentration .",
    "nevertheless , both the momentum dispersion and the total spectral weight are only slightly affected by a doping of 1/16 and 1/8 .",
    "only the two - spin response at @xmath1 changes strongly , with a large reduction of its spectral weight and an enhancement of the excitation energy . at other momenta",
    "the higher - energy , generic features of the magnetic response are robust against doping .",
    "this shows that the strong short - range antiferromagnetic correlations that are still present after doping give rise to higher energy , damped magnetic excitations with considerable spectral weight .",
    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian is one of the most studied model hamiltonians in the context of high temperature superconductivity in doped , quasi-2d cuprates . naturally , it is directly relevant to quasi-1d cuprates as well , among which edge - sharing 1d spin chains in li@xmath5cuo@xmath5 and gecuo@xmath4 and corner sharing in srcuo@xmath5 and sr@xmath5cuo@xmath4 .",
    "charge excitations have been extensively studied by exact diagonalization of hubbard or charge - transfer models relevant for these systems , also in the context of rixs  @xcite . in a hubbard - type model for an undoped chain",
    "the presence of singlet excitations of spinon pairs was identified , which is due to the presence of doubly occupied sites  @xcite .",
    "very recently the rixs response of the undoped spin - only chain was computed by bethe ansatz , which will serve as a benchmark for the present exact diagonalization study.@xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic response of doped @xmath0 chains has received remarkably little attention in the literature so far .",
    "studies of spin dynamics in the 1d @xmath0 model have considered the limit of quarter - filling , with a hole concentration of 3/4 , by monte - carlo@xcite , exact - diagonalization@xcite and recursion methods@xcite , focusing on the regime of weak and strong coupling , comparing one- and two - dimensional features , as well as determining the evolution of the spinon spectrum in presence of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "here we consider the weakly doped chain , with doping concentrations where in the 2d cuprates superconductivity appears and we concentrate on the specific question how far the different types of magnetic excitations to which rixs is sensitive are affected by the presence of mobile charge carriers .      without doping the 1d @xmath0 model",
    "reduces to the heisenberg afm , which is one of the few many - body problems where the ground state , which is a su(2 ) singlet , and the lowest excited states are known exactly.@xcite it is described by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the exchange coupling and @xmath22 is the spin operator at the @xmath23-site .",
    "it is well - known that this model fails to develop long - range n@xmath10el ordering ( where neighbouring spins point anti - parallel to each other ) even at the lowest temperatures but rather it has an algebraically decaying spin - spin correlation.@xcite moreover , the basic excitations are spinons,@xcite which are topological excitations that can be visualized as twists of @xmath1 in the spin order .",
    "spinons are fractional particles that possess spin values of s = 1/2 , whose dispersion relation is given by @xmath24 , @xmath25 $ ] in unit of @xmath21 . because of quantum mechanics constraints , only an even number of spinons can be created .",
    "the lowest energy excitations are made of two spinon states , that live within a continuum in @xmath26 defined by the kinematic constraints of momentum and energy conservation : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "hence , for a fixed external momentum , there exists an interval in frequency given by the conditions : @xmath29 with @xmath30 $ ] . here ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the lower and upper bands , respectively .",
    "this behavior obviously very different from 2d and 3d systems , where the excitations in the ordered state are spin - waves , which possess a spin value equal to one and follow a well - defined trajectory in energy and wave - vector space in complete contrast to the multi - spinon continuum .",
    "two - spinon excitations are routinely measured by inelastic neutron scattering@xcite , but the same response function can also be measured with rixs . a wealth of theoretical work has been done on the ts correlation function related to neutron structure factor and the exact theoretical spectrum perfectly matches with experimental results.@xcite    the two - spinon part of the ts function is finite inside the two - spinon continuum , and by construction it vanishes identically outside of it",
    ". it has been demonstrated that approximately two thirds of the excitations in this band are indeed of the two - spinon type .",
    "the remaining part has a rather small spectral weight and is carried mostly by four - spinon excitations.@xcite in fig.[fig : spinon - continua ] , these two - spinon and four - spinon bands are schematically represented .",
    "recently it was proven for the fs response function , even if it involves the excitation of two spins , overwhelmingly fractionalizes into two - spinon states.@xcite    within this context , we now start a systematic comparison of the numerical spectra related to the ts and fs correlation functions",
    ". we will demonstrate that our results recover the main features ( e.g. , dispersion and selection rules ) of the exact theoretical results , providing the starting point for the subsequent discussion about doping evolution .      in the introduction we mentioned that both direct and indirect rixs can probe magnetic excitations . in direct rixs",
    ", single spin - flip excitations can be made at the @xmath33 edges of cu because of the large spin - orbit coupling of the 2@xmath34 core - hole.@xcite since in the intermediate state spin and orbital angular momentum separately are no longer good quantum numbers , orbital and spin can be exchanged and direct spin - flip processes can in principle be allowed . as in the neutron scattering , the rixs cross section consists of a local structure factor ( depending on the polarization , the experimental geometry and the excitation mechanism ) multiplied by the appropriate spin susceptibility @xcite + @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ground state , @xmath37 an excited state , @xmath38 the energy lost by the photon , and @xmath39 is the single - spin form factor .",
    "it was shown both theoretically,@xcite and experimentally @xcite that spin - flip excitations are a result of the effect of l@xmath40s@xmath40 operator in the core hole spin - orbit coupling , so one can get a pure spin - flip transition for a cu@xmath41 ion with a hole in the @xmath42 orbital only if the spin is not parallel to the z - axis .    for indirect rixs at cu k - edges ( @xmath43 ) , the core hole couples to the spin degree of freedom locally modifying the superexchange interactions.@xcite in this process , the total spin of the valence electrons is conserved , and only excitations with at least two spins flipped ( with total s@xmath44 ) are allowed.@xcite detailed calculations of the magnetic response functions within the ucl expansion@xcite demonstrated that the magnetic correlation function , measured by indirect rixs , is a four - spin correlation one , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the two - spin form factor . at the transition metal l - edges , a similar mechanism occurs ( in addition to the direct single spin - flip scattering discussed above ) because the photo - excited electron in the @xmath47 subshell frustrates the local superexchange bonds.@xcite    to calculate @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we apply the lanczos algorithm to a 22-sites heisenberg chain and we employ eigenvectors and eigenvalues for the evaluation of the correlation functions as in eqs .",
    "[ eq : correlators]-[eq : correlatoro ] .",
    "in addition , we perform an extensive analysis of the momentum dependence of the frequency moments .",
    "we evaluate the average peak position with respect to the double differential cross section @xmath50 as @xmath51 and we use the total weight @xmath52 to gain information on the relative ratio as a function of doping concentration and to compare the total intensity of the bare ts and fs spectra .",
    "note that these outcomes are possibly easier to compare with experiments , with respect to the differential cross - section itself .",
    "the reason is twofold :",
    "i ) the presence of statistical errors in experiments is less relevant for the integrated quantities , so a direct comparison with theory is feasible ; ii ) since lineshapes of the theoretical spectra are typically not lorentzian , the average excitation energy of the calculated spectra is expected to be the most representative theoretical result .    before describing the results obtained within our simulation",
    ", we would like to point out that the magnetic excitations described by eqs .",
    "[ eq : correlators]-[eq : correlatoro ] belong to orthogonal subspaces , as illustrated in fig.[fig : two - spinon - sketch ] .",
    "the figure aims to clarify that the @xmath48 ts response is related to a single spin - flip that gives rise to a two spinons carrying parallel spin . instead @xmath49 fs response function is due to a double spin - flip that fractionalize into two spinons , having opposite spin . starting from the su(2 )",
    "singlet ground state , the excitation governing @xmath48 thus carries s=1 while for @xmath49 the excitation has s=0 .",
    "this crucial aspect allows to distinguish between ` polarized ' and ` unpolarized ' excitations and suggests that the two magnetic responses can have a different sensitivity to for example spinon - spinon interactions or an external magnetic field .    in the top panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : tj - s]-[fig : tj - o ] , we report the undoped inelastic intensity evaluated numerically starting from ts and fs correlation functions , respectively",
    ". there are several common features emerging : the dispersions show similar behavior , the excitation spectrum is mainly located in the two - spinon band , both for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with an energy scale @xmath53 . moreover , the intensity is dominated by the spectral weight at the lower threshold of the two - spinon continuum .",
    "these results confirm that both @xmath48 and @xmath49 mainly fractionalize in two - spinon excitations@xcite . from a closer inspection at the energy region comprised between the upper boundary of the two - spinon continuum and the upper boundary of the four - spinon continuum , high energy tails emerge as consequence of the four - spinon part of the structure factors , that are finite but very small and rapidly approaching to zero .",
    "nevertheless , spectra do show differences in dispersion .",
    "looking at the white circles of fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - heis - moments ] , we infer that for the correlation function @xmath49 the spectrum disperses from zero at @xmath54 , up to a maximum of @xmath55 at @xmath2 , the intensity is suppressed at @xmath1 and nearby , a fact that is due to structure factor @xmath56 and not to the density of states , as reported in lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - heis - moments ] where the moment @xmath16 is plotted .",
    "the vanishing of the rixs intensity described by @xmath49 at the antiferromgnetic wavevector @xmath1 is due to the cancellation of the sums over the two sublattices in an antiferromagnetic order .",
    "a more detailed explanation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath48 has its maximum at @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - heis - moments ] ) .",
    "the appearance of a satellite peak at the afm point located at higher energies can also be noticed .",
    "finally , we remark that , as long as the bare correlation functions are considered , the total weight is larger in the fs case , almost all over the bz ( away from @xmath1 ) , while the highest peak intensities are comparable .",
    "the doped heisenberg model is here considered in terms of the single - band @xmath0 model,@xcite @xmath57 where the sums run over all the @xmath58 bonds , counted once , and @xmath59 operators describe electrons in the @xmath3 electronic levels with the constraint of no double occupancy .    by following the same procedure described in the previous section ,",
    "we analyze the evolution upon doping of the ts and fs spectra .",
    "two cases are considered : the hole concentration @xmath60=1/16 and @xmath60=1/8 , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig : tj - s ] and [ fig : tj - o ] we report the spectra for @xmath61 , a ratio that is typical for corner - sharing cuprate perovskites .",
    "as one can see , the spectra are generally softened and broadened and the intensity of the highest peaks is reduced as n@xmath62 is increased .",
    "this effect is more dramatic at @xmath1 for ts , where the peak is strongly damped .",
    "in contrast , the doping does not affect substantially the dispersion of the excitation continuum , the only effect being a transfer of spectral weight towards the upper threshold of the two - spinon continuum , with tails in the four - spinon region .",
    "concerning the selection rules , the inelastic intensity is vanishing at @xmath54 for both ts and fs , and it is suppressed at @xmath1 for @xmath63 .    considering the frequency moments reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - heis - moments ] , interesting features come out .",
    "namely , as long as the ts is concerned , major differences occur around the afm wave - vector , where @xmath15 strongly decreases with the increases of the doping .",
    "this result is somewhat expected since afm correlations are weakened by doping .",
    "the evolution of @xmath16 suggests that the average peak position stays almost unchanged upon doping ; nevertheless it is shifted to @xmath64 approaching @xmath1 . as compared to the ts correlation function",
    ", the intensity of the fs appears to be renormalized in a less dramatic way . the total weight",
    "is even increased in the first half of the bz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - heis - moments ] ) and the intensity of the highest peak at @xmath2 is much less softened than the corresponding ts at @xmath1 . a further look at @xmath16",
    "allows to conclude that @xmath60=1/16 leaves the dispersion of the average peak position unmodified while , by increasing @xmath60 , the dispersion is shifted to slightly higher energies ( @xmath65 ) . from these outcomes",
    ", we can conclude that both the magnetic dispersions mapped by @xmath48 and @xmath49 are quite robust against the doping , as long as the lightly doped regime is considered , and we also infer that the robustness of the two - spinon feature is directly linked to the existence of short - range afm correlations , irrespective of doping concentration .    finally , concerning the transfer of spectral weight towards the upper threshold of the two - spinon continuum , we may deduce that it can be related to an ` itinerancy effect ' due to the fact that the introduction of mobile carriers induces charge fluctuations that couple to spin excitations .",
    "we note that an analogue effect is known to be played by correlation energy . for a single - band 1d hubbard model at half filling , it has been showed that for large values of the on - site repulsion @xmath66 , the spin correlations are dominated by virtual hopping processes of electrons and are described in terms of a spin-1/2 heisenberg chain ; in this limit , the spectral weight of spin structure factor @xmath48 is concentrated at the lower spinon boundary.@xcite if @xmath66 is decreased , the real hopping of electrons becomes important and eventually dominates the spin response .",
    "the electron itinerancy may influence the magnetic correlations , and it is found that the spin structure factor of the hubbard model differs from the spectrum of the heisenberg model since a significant spectral weight is concentrated on the upper spinon boundary .",
    "@xcite we therefore infer that in our case those ` itinerancy corrections ' arising from charge excitations may be driven by doping with holes , both on ts and fs functions .",
    "for finite heisenberg and @xmath0 chains we have calculated the two - spin ( ts ) and four - spin ( fs ) correlation functions , which determine the magnetic rixs spectra of cuprates .",
    "the calculation is performed by means of the lanczos algorithm applied to 22-sites heisenberg and 16-sites @xmath0 models .",
    "we firstly show that both functions measure multi - spinon excitations , and we find that the dominant contribution arises from the two - spinon continuum . depending on which function",
    "is considered , one can access to ` polarized ' ( @xmath67 ) or ` unpolarized ' ( @xmath68 ) excitations , resulting also in a different momentum dispersion . then",
    ", as long as the heisenberg model is concerned , one observes that @xmath49 peaks at @xmath2 while @xmath48 peaks at @xmath1 , where @xmath49 vanishes ; away from @xmath1 , the first has a total weight lower than the latter . when doping is introduced , both the ts and fs spectra are softened and spread out .",
    "the maximum peak intensities are strongly renormalized , but the total integrated intensity is slightly modified : the spectra tend to broaden .",
    "the ts and fs spectra show a general transfer of spectral weight towards the higher energy sectors of the two - spinon band .",
    "the main features of the ts and fs spectra , however , exemplified by for instance their zeroth and first moment , show a remarkable robustness against to doping .",

    "<S> we study the dynamical , momentum dependent two- and four - spin response functions in doped and undoped 1d cuprates , as probed by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering , using an exact numerical diagonalization procedure . in the undoped @xmath0 system </S>",
    "<S> the four - spin response vanishes at @xmath1 , whereas the two - spin correlator is peaked around @xmath2 , with generally larger spectral weight . upon doping spectra </S>",
    "<S> tend to soften and broaden , with a transfer of spectral weight towards higher energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total spectral weight and average peak position of either response are only weakly affected by doping up to a concentration of 1/8 . </S>",
    "<S> only the two - spin response at @xmath1 changes strongly , with a large reduction of spectral weight and enhancement of excitation energy . at other momenta </S>",
    "<S> the higher - energy , generic features of the magnetic response are robust against doping . </S>",
    "<S> it signals the presence of strong short - range antiferromagnetic correlations , even after doping mobile holes into the system . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this to hold also in higher dimensions . </S>"
