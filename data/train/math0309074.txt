    "[ [ section ] ]    a partition is a nonincreasing sequence @xmath0 of nonnegative integers such that @xmath1 for all sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , a plane partition is a matrix of nonnegative integers with nonincreasing rows and columns and finitely many nonzero entries , for example @xmath3 a standard geometric image associated to a partition is its diagram .",
    "there are several competing traditions of drawing the diagrams of partitions ; we follow the one illustrated in figure [ f2 ] which shows the diagram of the partition @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , the diagram of a plane partition is a 3-dimensional object which looks like a stack of cubes pushed into a corner .",
    "the 3d diagram corresponding to the partition is shown in figure [ f1 ]    [ [ rsk ] ]    naturally , partitions are inseparable from symmetric functions .",
    "similarly , application of symmetric functions to enumeration of plane partitions is a combinatorial classics , an illustrated account of which can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "our goal in these lectures is to explain some recent progress in applying symmetric function theory to get rather refined information about random partitions , both ordinary and 3-dimensional .",
    "random partitions , in addition to being interesting simply for their own sake , arise in a large variety of other contexts",
    ".    one of the most important situations in which random partitions arise is the study of increasing and decreasing subsequences in a random permutation , see for example @xcite .",
    "namely , the celebrated robinson - schensted correspondence associates to any permutation @xmath5 a partition @xmath6 of @xmath7 , which by greene  fomin extension ( see e.g. @xcite ) of schensted s theorem @xcite encodes the increasing and decreasing subsequences of @xmath8 . concretely , the number @xmath9 of squares in the first @xmath10 rows of @xmath6 equals the maximal cardinality of a union of @xmath10 increasing subsequences of @xmath8 .",
    "the same is true about columns of @xmath11 and decreasing subsequences of @xmath8 .",
    "increasing subsequences of random permutations play a central role , for example , in the analysis of many random growth processes .",
    "therefore , one wants to understand the push - forward of the uniform probability measure on @xmath12 under the map @xmath13 .",
    "this push - forward is well known to be the _ plancherel measure _ on partitions of @xmath7 given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group .",
    "the number @xmath15 has a very transparent combinatorial meaning : it is the number of chains of partitions ( also known as standard tableaux ) of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 means that @xmath18 is obtained from @xmath19 by removing a square .",
    "there are several useful formulas for the number @xmath15 , in particular , the hook formula .",
    "the textbooks @xcite are a wonderful place to learn about these things .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the following law of large numbers for the plancherel measure was discovered by logan and shepp @xcite and , independently , vershik and kerov @xcite .",
    "consider a diagram of a partition of @xmath7 as in figure [ f2 ] and scale it in both directions by factor of @xmath20 ( note that the rescaled diagram has unit area ) .",
    "the rescaled diagram for a plancherel - typical partition of a large number @xmath7 will then look something like the diagram in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "now look at the zigzag path in figure [ f3 ] formed by the boundary of the diagram .",
    "this zigzag is a graph of a piecewise linear function and , in this way , the plancherel measure becomes a measure on continuous ( and even lipschitz with constant @xmath21 ) functions .",
    "the discovery of logan - shepp - vershik - kerov is that , as @xmath22 , this measure converges ( see @xcite for precise statements ) to the delta measure supported on the following function @xmath23 this formula looks , at first , rather formidable , but its derivative is much simpler , namely @xmath24 naturally extended by @xmath25 for @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "in fact , the derivative @xmath27 is a very natural object because it measures how often the zigzag path in figure [ f3 ] goes up ( respectively , down ) in the neighborhood of a given point on the boundary of the limit shape .",
    "in other words , if we think of the zigzag path as a random sequence of `` ups '' and `` downs '' , @xmath27 is related to the probability to observe an `` up '' in a given position .",
    "traditionally , probabilities of this kind are called _",
    "correlation functions_. more precisely , the the probability to observe `` up '' in a given position is the 1-point correlation function of our random sequence of `` ups '' and `` downs '' .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    it is now natural to ask about higher correlations , for example , what is the probability to observe several consecutive `` ups '' , or , more generally , any given pattern of `` ups '' and `` downs '' ?",
    "such questions can be conveniently formalized using the following set @xmath28 this is the set of `` downs '' of the boundary of @xmath29 as illustrated in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "[ 0.5],title=\"fig : \" ]    we remark that the map @xmath30 is a bijection of the set of partitions and the set of subsets @xmath31 such that @xmath32 in other words , the set @xmath33 has equally many positive elements and negative `` holes '' ( this number is the length of the diagonal in the diagram @xmath29 ) .",
    "we now take a finite set @xmath34 which is allowed to depend on @xmath7 in such a way that @xmath35\\ , , \\quad n\\to \\infty\\,,\\ ] ] and all differences @xmath36 have a limit , finite or infinite .",
    "the set @xmath37 is the set where we want to observe the `` downs '' .",
    "the parameters @xmath38 describes the global position of our observations on the limit shape @xmath39 while the differences @xmath36 record their relative local separation .",
    "it is clear the following probabilities ( a.k.a .",
    "correlation functions ) @xmath40 to observe `` downs '' in positions @xmath41 include all possible information about the local shape of the random partition @xmath29 .",
    "as it turns out , all these probabilities have a very pretty @xmath22 limit , namely , we have the following :    [ t1 ] for @xmath37 as above we have @xmath42_{i , j=1\\dots n } \\ , , \\label{limpl}\\ ] ] as @xmath22 , where @xmath43 is the discrete sine kernel with parameters @xmath44    in the formula , it is understood that @xmath45 which implies that the determinant in factors into blocks corresponding to distinct values of @xmath38 . in other words , it means that the occurrences of `` downs '' in different parts of the limit shape become independent in the @xmath22 limit , which , intuitively , is what one expects .",
    "it is also understood in that @xmath46 in particular , the 1-point correlation function , that is , the density of `` downs '' is @xmath47 this translates into and also explains the role of the parameter @xmath48 in the sine kernel : it is the density parameter .    finally , it is natural to extend the function by @xmath49 or @xmath50 for @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "theorem [ t1 ] remains valid and says simply that for @xmath52 ( resp .",
    "@xmath53 ) the zigzag in figure [ f3 ] goes only up ( resp .",
    "down ) .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    one encounters a formula which looks just like the formula in the random matrix theory , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "concretely , consider a gaussian probability measure @xmath54 on the real vector space of hermitian @xmath55 matrices @xmath56 with density @xmath57 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath58 of a random matrix @xmath56 is a random @xmath7-element subset of @xmath59 .",
    "consider the probability density @xmath60 to have @xmath61 for some fixed @xmath41 , that is , the probability density to observe eigenvalues of @xmath56 in given positions .",

    "it is important to remember that since @xmath67 is a density , it transforms nontrivially under a change of variables and , in particular , it scales nontrivially under the scaling of variables .",
    "the @xmath21-point correlation function @xmath68 describes the density of eigenvalues of @xmath56 .",
    "the analog of the limit shape @xmath39 in this case is the wigner semicircle law @xmath69\\,,\\quad n\\to \\infty \\,.\\ ] ] in other words , scaled by @xmath70 , the density of eigenvalues converges to the semicircle with diameter @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the normalization @xmath72 is related to the fact that there are @xmath7 eigenvalues of @xmath56 and , because they all are concentrated on the segment @xmath73 $ ] , the density of eigenvalues is expected to be of order @xmath70 .    by the same token ,",
    "the typical spacing between the eigenvalues is of order @xmath74 .",
    "it is then meaningful to ask about the asymptotics of @xmath75 as @xmath76 \\",
    ", , \\quad \\sqrt{n}(x_i - x_j)\\to y_i - y_j \\,,\\ ] ] for some fixed @xmath77 .",
    "one finds ( see @xcite ) that in this limit @xmath78 \\ , , \\quad r(u)=\\sqrt{1-(u/2)^2 } \\,.\\label{limh}\\ ] ] this looks almost identical to , with one minor and one not so minor difference .",
    "the minor difference is a different dependence of the density parameter in the sine kernel on the global position @xmath79 .",
    "a more important difference is that in the variables @xmath36 take only discrete values , whereas in we deal with continuous variables .    in the continuous case , we can get rid of the density parameter in the sine kernel by a simple rescaling . after this transformation , the global question of eigenvalue density and the local question of spacings between the eigenvalues become completely decoupled .",
    "much work has been done in the random matrix theory to show that the eigenvalue spacing have the same sine kernel form for many much more general measures on the space of matrices , in other words , to show that the occurrence of the sine kernel is _ universal _ , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "comparing , with reveals an striking `` universality of formulas '' , namely that the formulas are the same even when the meaning is different .",
    "this parallel , however , is more than purely formal .",
    "for example , the discrete sine kernel process shares many features of its continuous counterpart , such as the repulsion of eigenvalues which we will discuss momentarily . also , continuous distributions , such as the distributions of eigenvalues of a @xmath80 gaussian hermitian matrix , can be obtained as a suitable limit of certain natural measures ( of the kind considered below ) on partitions with @xmath7 parts .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    it can be inferred from the formula that the eigenvalues of a random matrix have a strong tendency to be equally spaced , much more so than simply a random collection of points on a line .",
    "for example , the 2-point correlation function ( in the unit density case ) is equal to @xmath81 which is very small ( has a double zero ) near @xmath82 and has maxima for @xmath83 .",
    "it was noted by kerov that a there exists a similar repulsion of `` ups '' and `` downs '' in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "namely , the `` ups '' and `` downs '' tend to be much more uniformly spaced than outcomes of independent trials , such as , for example , the occurrences of `` heads '' in independent coin tosses .",
    "let us illustrate this by a numerical example .",
    "suppose that we are in the very middle of the limit shape ( that is , @xmath84 ) , where the density of both `` ups '' and `` downs '' is equal to @xmath85 in this case the discrete sine kernel takes an especially simple form @xmath86 consider the following probabilities @xmath87 where each string has length @xmath88 .",
    "these discrete sine kernel probabilities are given by certain @xmath89 determinants .",
    "if the `` ups '' and `` downs '' were like `` heads '' and `` tails '' of independent coin tosses , both @xmath90 and @xmath91 would equal @xmath92 .",
    "but as the plot of @xmath93 and @xmath94 in figure [ fr ] shows @xmath95 which means that the discrete sine kernel process very strongly prefers even spacing of its `` ups '' and `` down '' .",
    "[ 0.25 ] , @xmath88 , and @xmath96,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ [ section-5 ] ]    the connection between the plancherel measure and random matrices becomes exact near the edge of the logan - shepp - vershik - kerov limit shape and the wigner semicircle , respectively .",
    "in other words , the maximal parts @xmath97 of a plancherel random partition , suitably scaled , behave in @xmath22 limit _ exactly _ like the maximal eigenvalues of an hermitian random matrix .",
    "for @xmath98 it was proven by baik , deift , and johansson in @xcite , who also conjectured that the same holds for any @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( for @xmath101 they verified this in @xcite ) .    by schensted s theorem , mentioned in section [ rsk ]",
    ", this means that the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation is , asymptotically , distributed like the largest eigenvalue of a hermitian random matrix .",
    "this distribution is known as the tracy - widom distribution @xcite and is given explicitly in term of a certain solution of the painlev ii equation .",
    "the random point process describing the maximal eigenvalues of a random hermitian matrix @xmath56 is known as the _ airy ensemble _ because the correlation function of this process are described by the same determinantal formula as in with the sine kernel replaced by the airy kernel @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the airy function @xmath104 the joint distributions of the largest , 2nd largest , and so on points of the airy ensemble satisfy quite complicated nonlinear pdes , generalizing the painlev ii equation for the tracy - widom distribution .",
    "the description of the airy ensemble by its correlation functions is much simpler and this is the description that we will use in what follows .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    the first proof of the full baik - deift - johansson conjecture was given in @xcite by establishing a direct asymptotics correspondence between permutations and matrices via a certain correspondence between counting maps on surfaces and counting branched covering of the sphere .",
    "a different proof was soon after found , independently , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is this second proof that will be explained in these lectures .",
    "it is clear from theorem [ t1 ] that all correlation become trivial at @xmath105 , which is because near @xmath105 the `` downs '' become so rare that they occur infinitely far away from each other . in other words , for a plancherel typical partition @xmath106 as @xmath22 for any fixed @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , @xmath108 should be typically of order @xmath109 , which can be seen heuristically as follows .    the expected number of @xmath99 s that are larger than @xmath110 is equal to @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "since there are exactly @xmath10 parts of @xmath29 that are greater or equal to @xmath113 we expect that for @xmath114 @xmath115 whence @xmath116 which precisely means that @xmath117 should be typically of order @xmath109 for large @xmath7 .",
    "this heuristics explains the scaling in the following result ( conjectured by baik , deift , and johansson ) , which is the analog of theorem [ t1 ] for the edge @xmath105 of the limit shape @xmath39 .",
    "[ ta ] as @xmath22 , the random variables @xmath118 converge in joint distribution to the airy ensemble .    [",
    "[ section-7 ] ]    we now move on to plane partitions and 3d diagrams . on this set , we consider the following measure : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the volume of a 3d diagram @xmath50 and @xmath121 is the normalizing factor @xmath122 the second equality being the classical identity due to mcmahon .    in particular , this measure gives equal weight @xmath123 to all partitions of size @xmath7 .",
    "is is natural to ask why we consider this essentially uniform measure and not some analog of the plancherel measure on 3d diagrams ( which could involve , for example , the number of ways to construct @xmath50 starting from the empty partition by adding a square at a time ) .",
    "the answer is that this measure _ is _ the proper analog of the plancherel measure for the following reason . by definition and ,",
    "@xmath124 is proportional to the number of chains of the form @xmath125 such that @xmath126 if one assembles all these @xmath127 into an array of partitions , one sees a structure closely resembling a 3d diagram and , by construction , the plancherel measure is the distribution of the central slice of this structure induced by the uniform measure on all chains of the form .",
    "this also suggests that the proper way to look at 3d diagram is to separate them into their diagonal slices ( and also suggest a common generalization of the measures @xmath128 and @xmath129 to be introduced later ) .",
    "in particular , the diagonal slices of the partition from are @xmath130 where @xmath131 means that @xmath29 and @xmath19 interlace ( this relation replaces the relation @xmath132 in ) .",

    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    in particular , the limit of the 1-point correlation function , that is , the limiting density of the horizontal faces , is given by @xmath159 here the second equality is literally true if the two circles in theorem [ t2 ] intersect .",
    "otherwise , the arccosine has to be extended by @xmath49 or @xmath50 which , just like for the plancherel measure , corresponds to trivial correlations . in other words , when the two circles in theorem [ t2 ] do not intersect it means that we are trying to measure correlations outside of the limit shape .",
    "this limit shape , the existence of which was first established by vershik @xcite and which was described explicitly by cerf and kenyon in @xcite , can be reconstructed by integrating the density .",
    "this integral can be evaluated in terms of the dilogarithm function .",
    "the plot of the limit shape can be seen in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    it is difficult to deny that the best way to solve an asymptotic problem is to have a nice exact formula valid before the limit , which would make passing to the limit conceptually clear , if not completely straightforward .",
    "a wonderful feature of our problems is that such exact formulas are indeed available .",
    "in fact , exact formulas for correlation functions are available for much more general class of measures . these measures , which we call _ schur process _ , will be described presently . by definition @xcite",

    "the general formalism of schur processes , however , works equally well for any choice of signs .",
    "the above definition of a schur process is slightly different from the one given in @xcite , which avoids the awkward necessity of choosing signs , but is essentially equivalent .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    for example , let @xmath171 that is , let the alphabet @xmath166 consist of a single variable @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is a parameter ( e.g.   a complex number such that @xmath174 ) .",

    "the essence of this method is that the asymptotics of the integral @xmath255 for a real function @xmath256 is dominated by arbitrarily small neighborhoods of the points where the function @xmath256 takes its maximal value .",
    "if @xmath257 is such a point then @xmath258 and hence @xmath259 assume that @xmath260 ( and hence @xmath261 ) and introduce a new @xmath163 variable by @xmath262 then for fixed @xmath163 @xmath263 and we see that the leading contribution of @xmath257 to is given by @xmath264 similar considerations apply in the case when the maximum of @xmath256 at @xmath257 is degenerate , that is , when @xmath265 , but , for example , @xmath266 .    for similar integrals in the complex plane @xmath267 where @xmath268 is some contour , one first deforms the contour @xmath268 to make is pass through the critical points @xmath269 of @xmath270 ( also known as saddle points ) in such a way that the real part of @xmath270 has a local maximum along @xmath268 at @xmath269 .",

    "it is obvious that the residue of the integrand in at @xmath285 is equal to @xmath286 .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath287 as was to be shown .",
    "we now turn to the asymptotics on the edge of the limit shape which for the plancherel measure is described in theorem [ ta ] .",
    "recall that near the edge @xmath105 of the limit shape the distance between two consecutive `` downs '' is of order @xmath109 and hence also the probability to observe a `` down '' in any particular position is of order @xmath288 , where @xmath7 is the size of the partition @xmath29 . for the poissonized plancherel measure @xmath198 the expected size of @xmath29",
    "is @xmath193 . from theorem [ ta ]",
    "we , therefore , expect that @xmath289 we will now use the steepest descent method to deduce from .",

    "the difference between and theorem [ ta ] is a technical , but rather standard , collection of estimates that allows one to deduce the convergence of joint distributions for plancherel measures from the convergence of correlation functions of their poissonizations .",
    "we now start the asymptotic analysis of the integral in the @xmath105 regime .",
    "what happens in this case is that the two nondegenerate critical points @xmath290 of @xmath277 coalesce at @xmath291 to form one degenerate critical point @xmath292 since @xmath277 appears in the exponent in , this starts looking like the airy integral , and , indeed , this is precisely the source of the appearance of the airy function in .",
    "in fact , this is the fundamental reason why the airy function is as ubiquitous in asymptotics as the sine function . the sine function appearance in the steepest descent asymptotics is usually produced by two complex conjugate critical points .",
    "when the parameters are tuned so that these two points coalesce , the airy function enters the scene .",
    "this is all very standard and is at length discussed , for example , in @xcite and many other places .",
    "the integral converges , but only conditionally , due to ever faster oscillation of the cosine function for large @xmath293 . a much better integral can be obtained from by shifting the contour of integration as shown in figure [ fca ] .",
    "the contour in figure [ fca ] goes along 2 of the 3 downslopes of the graph of @xmath294 , plotted in figure [ fsed ] and commonly known as the monkey saddle .",
    "the function @xmath295 is very rapidly decaying on this contour .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath105 all the action in the integral is happening in the neighborhood of the critical point @xmath296 , so we want to zoom in on this point .",
    "we also want the integration contour in @xmath154 to pass through the downslopes of the graph of the real part of , while the @xmath297-contour should go along the ridges of the same graph ( because the of the opposite sign of the @xmath298 term in ) .",
    "we thus deform the integration as shown in the left half of figure [ fai ] and introduce the following new integration variables @xmath299 for large @xmath193 , the integration contour in @xmath300 and @xmath301 will look like the contour in the right half of figure [ fai ] .",
    "more generally , the leading order expansion of @xmath277 near @xmath304 with respect to both arguments is given by @xmath305 plugging this into the integral we obtain the following @xmath306 where the integration contour ( rotated by @xmath307 ) is shown in the right half of figure [ fai ] .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath308 this is entirely parallel to the argument in section [ skb ] ( see the more general discussion in section 2.2.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have @xmath309 inserting this into the lhs of and integrating by parts we obtain @xmath310 the formula translates into @xmath311 because our contour of integration in @xmath300 ( see figure [ fai ] ) is the negative of the contour in figure [ fca ] .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath312 thus , equation follows .      after finishing these computations",
    ", it may be useful to look at them from a more abstract point of view .",
    "above , we tried to be absolutely concrete and explicit , but in fact we used only very general properties of the correlation kernel .",
    "namely , all that was needed was the information about the location of the critical points of the function @xmath313 in and the residue of the integrand in at @xmath285 .",
    "the fact that the two critical were complex conjugate , which was important for obtaining the sine function , is an automatic consequence of the fact the integrand is real for real values of the argument .",
    "even less was required for the airy function asymptotics , the only essential ingredient in which was the coalescence of the two critical points .",
    "this means the same method is applicable to much a wider variety of problems producing the same or equivalent results .",
    "this phenomenon , when the final asymptotic result proves to be insensitive to the fine details of the original problem , is known as _ universality_. the simplest example of this phenomenon may be the central limit theorem which says that , under very general assumptions , sums of independent , identically distributed , but otherwise arbitrary random variables converge , scaled and centered , to the normal distribution .",
    "it is widely believed that the universality principle applies very generally . from a mathematical perspective",
    "it is often quite mysterious why this should be the case , but sometimes , like for the central limit theorem , there is a transparent explanation .",
