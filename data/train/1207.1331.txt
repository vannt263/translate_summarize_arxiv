    "a quantum point contact ( qpc ) is the simplest mesoscopic device that directly shows quantum mechanical properties .",
    "it is a short ballistic transport channel between two electron reservoirs , which shows quantized conductance as a function of the width of the channel @xcite .",
    "a widely applied approach for implementing qpcs is using a split - gate structure on the surface of a heterostructure with a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at about 100  nm beneath its surface .",
    "the conventional design of such a split - gate qpc has two metallic gate fingers ( fig .",
    "[ fig1sempic]a ) . operating this device with a negative gate voltage @xmath0 results in the formation of a barrier with a small tunable opening between two 2deg reservoirs , because the 2deg below the gate fingers gets depleted over a range that depends on @xmath0 . for electrons in the 2deg",
    ", this appears as an electrostatic potential @xmath1 that is a large barrier with a small opening in the form of a saddle - point potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig3saddlepotential ] ) .",
    "the saddle - point potential gives transverse confinement in the channel that is roughly parabolic , which results for this transverse direction in a discrete set of electronic energy levels .",
    "for electron transport along the channel this gives a discrete set of subbands with one - dimensional character .",
    "quantized conductance appears because each subband contributes @xmath2 to the channel s conductance @xcite , where @xmath3 is the electron charge and @xmath4 is planck s constant .",
    "the length of the qpc channel is fixed and can be parameterized by the lithographic length @xmath5 of the gate structure .",
    "the diagram also illustrates the measurement scheme ( see main text for details ) .",
    "( b ) sem image of a length tunable qpc with 6 gate fingers ( qpc@xmath6 device ) . here",
    "the effective length @xmath7 of the qpc can be tuned by changing the ratio of the gate voltages on the central gates ( @xmath8 ) and side gates ( @xmath9 ) . ]",
    "we present here the design and experimental characterization of qpcs which offer additional control over the shape of the saddle - point potential .",
    "we focused on developing devices for which the effective length of the saddle - point potential ( along the transport direction ) can be tuned _ in situ_. the additional control is implemented with a symmetric split - gate design based on 6 gate fingers ( fig .",
    "[ fig1sempic]b ) .",
    "such devices will be denoted as qpc@xmath6 , and conventional devices with 2 gate fingers ( fig .",
    "[ fig1sempic]a ) as qpc@xmath10 .",
    "these qpc@xmath11 are operated with the gate voltage on the outer fingers ( @xmath9 ) less negative than the gate voltage on the central fingers ( @xmath8 ) to avoid quantum dot formation .",
    "sweeping @xmath8 from more to less negative values opens the qpc@xmath11 .",
    "by co - sweeping @xmath9 at fixed ratio @xmath12 it behaves as a qpc with a certain length for the saddle - point potential , and this length can be chosen by setting @xmath12 : it is shortest for @xmath13 and longest for @xmath14 . for our design",
    "the effective length could be tuned from about 200  nm to 600  nm .",
    "the motivation for developing these length - tunable qpcs comes from studies of electron many - body effects in qpcs .",
    "a well - known manifestation of these many - body effects is the so - called 0.7  anomaly @xcite , which is an additional shoulder at @xmath15 in quantized conductance traces .",
    "these many - body effects are , despite many experimental and theoretical studies since 1996 @xcite , not yet fully understood .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite suggested that many - body effects cause the formation of one or more self - consistent localized states in the qpc channel , and that these effects result in the 0.7  anomaly and the other signatures of many - body physics .",
    "this theoretical work predicted a clear dependence on the length of the qpc channel , and testing this directly requires experiments where this length is varied .    the work by koop _ et al . _",
    "@xcite already explored the relation between the device geometry and parameters that describe the many - body effects in a large set of qpc@xmath10 devices .",
    "this work compared nominally identical devices , and devices for which the lithographic length @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1sempic]a ) and width of the channel in the split - gate structure was varied .",
    "these results were , however , not conclusive .",
    "the parameters that describe the many - body effects showed large , seemingly random variation , not correlated with the device geometry . at the same time , the devices showed ( besides the 0.7 anomaly ) clean quantized conductance traces , and the parameters that reflect the non - interacting electron physics did show the variation that one expects when changing the geometry ( for example , the channel pinch - off gate voltage @xmath16 and subband spacing @xmath17 ) .",
    "this confirms that these qpcs had saddle - point potentials that were smooth enough for showing quantized conductance , while it also shows that the many - body effects are very sensitive to small static fluctuations on these saddle - point potentials or to nanoscale device - to - device variations in the dimensions of the potentials .",
    "this picture was confirmed by shifting the channel position inside a particular qpc@xmath10 device .",
    "this can be implemented by operating a qpc@xmath10 with a difference @xmath18 between the values of @xmath0 on the two gate fingers in fig .",
    "[ fig1sempic]a .",
    "such a channel shift did not change the quantized conductance significantly , but did cause strong variation in the signatures of many - body physics .",
    "earlier work had established that such device - to - device fluctuations can be due to remote defects or impurities , a slight variation in electron density , or due to the nanoscale variation in devices that is inherent to the nanofabrication process @xcite . consequently , studying how the many - body effects depend on the length of the qpc channel requires qpcs for which the channel length can be tuned continuously _ in situ _ , and where this can be operated without a transverse displacement of the qpc channel in the semiconductor material .",
    "the work that we report here aimed at realizing such devices .",
    "this article is organized as follows : section  [ 5sec : designconsids ] starts with a short overview of the options and the choices we made for realizing the qpc@xmath11 devices .",
    "next , in section  [ 5sec : simulations ] , we present the results of electrostatic simulations . in section  [ 5sec :",
    "samplefabandtech ] , we describe the sample fabrication and measurement techniques .",
    "this is followed by comparing results from simulations and experiments for qpc@xmath6 devices in section [ 5sec : experimentalrelization ] , and section  [ 5sec : conclusion ] summarizes our conclusions .",

    "( b ) design of a qpc@xmath11 device with the 4 outer gates in a shape that explicitly induces a funnel shape for the entry and exit of the qpc transport channel . ]",
    "we designed our qpc@xmath11 devices with 6 rectangular gate fingers , in a symmetric layout with two sets of 3 parallel gate fingers ( fig .",
    "[ fig1sempic]b and fig .  [ fig2designqpc6f]a ) .",
    "sem inspection of fabricated devices yields that the central gate finger is 200  nm wide ( as measured along the direction of channel length @xmath7 ) .",
    "the outer gate fingers are 160  nm wide , and the narrow gaps between gate fingers are 44  nm wide .",
    "this yields @xmath19 for the total distance between the outer sides of the 3 parallel gate fingers .",
    "the lithographic width of the qpc channel ( distance between the two sets of 3 gate fingers ) is 350  nm .",
    "an example of alternative designs for the gate geometries that we considered is in fig .",
    "[ fig2designqpc6f]b .",
    "this design has a two - sided funnel shape for the channel and this could result in length - tunable qpc operation that better maintains a regular shape for the saddle - point potential .",
    "however , the electrostatic simulations in section  [ 5sec : simulations ] show that the rectangular gate fingers as in fig .",
    "[ fig2designqpc6f]a also give a length - tunable saddle - point potential that maintains a regular shape while tuning the length .",
    "this observation holds for a range of device dimensions similar to our design . for our particular design , the lithographic length and width ( 350  nm ) of the channel are comparable , and the 2deg is as far as 110  nm distance below the surface ( and the part in the center of the channel that actually contains electrons is very narrow , about 20  nm ) . in this regime , the saddle - point potential is strongly rounded with respect to the lithographic shapes of the gates ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig3saddlepotential]c , d ) .",
    "an important advantage of the rectangular design is that it provides two clear points for calibrating the effective channel length @xmath7 : operating at @xmath20 gives @xmath21 for the central gate finger alone ( 200  nm , see fig .",
    "[ fig1sempic]b ) , while operating at @xmath22 gives @xmath7 equal to the lithographic distance between the outer sides of the 3 parallel gate fingers ( 608  nm ) .",
    "a point of concern for this design that deserves attention is whether the narrow gaps between the 3 parallel gate fingers induce significant structure on the saddle - point potential .",
    "the electrostatic simulations show that this is not the case ( see again the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig3saddlepotential]c , d ) .",
    "the part of the channel that contains electrons is relatively far away from the gate electrodes , and the potential @xmath1 at this location is strongly rounded .",
    "notably , the full height of the potentials in fig .",
    "[ fig3saddlepotential ] is about 1  ev , while the occupied subbands are at a height of only about 10  mev above the stationary point of the saddle - point potential ( in the center of the channel ) .",
    "such gaps between parallel gate electrodes can be much narrower when depositing a wider gate on top of the central gate , with an insulating layer between them .",
    "we chose against applying this idea since we also aimed to have devices with a very low level of noise and instabilities from charge fluctuations at defect and impurity sites in the device materials . in this respect ,",
    "we expect better behavior when all gate fingers are deposited in a single fabrication cycle , and when deposition of an insulating oxide or polymer layer can be omitted .",
    "this section presents results of electrostatic simulations of the saddle - point potentials that define the qpc channel .",
    "the focus is on the design with 6 rectangular gate fingers ( fig .",
    "[ fig2designqpc6f]a ) , with gate dimensions as mentioned in the beginning of section  [ 5sec : designconsids ] .",
    "the simulations are based on the modeling approach that was introduced by davies _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "davies _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a method for modeling the electrostatics of gated 2deg .",
    "it calculates the electrostatic potential @xmath1 for electrons in the 2deg regions around the gates ( the approach only applies to the situation where the 2deg underneath the gates is depleted due to a negative voltage on gate electrodes ) .",
    "there are other models and approaches @xcite for calculating such potential landscapes , but these are all more complicated and computationally more demanding .",
    "the approach by davies _",
    "et al . _ is relatively simple .",
    "it does not account for electrostatic screening effects , and , notably , it does not account for the electron many - body interactions that were mentioned earlier .",
    "still , it was shown that it is well suited for calculating a valid picture of a qpc saddle - point potential near the channel pinch - off situation @xcite .",
    "felt by electrons in the 2deg plane .",
    "the plots represent an area of 1000@xmath231000  @xmath24 , centered at the middle of a qpc channel with a length @xmath5 of 200  nm ( a ) and 600  nm ( b ) of a qpc@xmath10 device with a lithographic channel width of 350  nm .",
    "it is calculated for the material parameters that are valid for the measured devices .",

    "( c),(d ) similar saddle - point potentials @xmath1 calculated for qpc@xmath11 devices ( with material parameters and geometry as the measured devices ) .",
    "the effective channel length is shorter for the case that is calculated for @xmath27 ( c ) than for the case @xmath28 ( d ) ( also note that qpc@xmath6 results for @xmath29 are the same as plot ( a ) ) .",
    "panel ( c ) and ( d ) also show that the narrow gaps between 3 parallel gate fingers do not induce significant structure at low energies in the saddle - point passage ( it only induces a weak fingerprint off to the side in the channel , at energies that are much higher than the occupied electron levels , see panel ( d ) ) . ]    the negative voltage on a gate that is needed to exactly deplete 2deg underneath a large gate is called the threshold voltage @xmath30 , and it is to a good approximation given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the electron density in the 2deg ( at zero gate voltage ) , @xmath33 is the depth of the 2deg , @xmath34 is the relative dielectric constant of the material below the gate , and @xmath35 is the dielectric constant of vacuum ( for details see ref .  ) .",
    "the value of @xmath36 for a certain 2deg material defines the value @xmath37 where the electrostatic potential @xmath1 for electrons in the 2deg becomes higher than the chemical potential of the 2deg . in turn , this can be used to define in an arbitrary potential landscape @xmath1 ( for arbitrary gates shapes and for arbitrary gate voltages ) the positions where @xmath38 .",
    "that is , one can calculate the positions in a gated device structure where there is a boundary between depleted and non - depleted 2deg , and also calculate the electrostatic potential @xmath1 around such points .",
    "when the center of the qpc has @xmath38 , the channel is at pinch - off and no electrons can pass through the qpc . the gate voltage at which this happens is called the pinch - off voltage @xmath16 .",
    "notably , the calculated value of @xmath1 at a certain position is simply the superposition of all the contributions to @xmath1 from different gate electrodes , and it is linear in the gate voltage on each of these electrodes @xcite .    figure  [ fig3saddlepotential ] presents examples of saddle - point potentials @xmath1 that are calculated with davies method , both for qpc@xmath10 and qpc@xmath11 devices .",
    "the calculations are for material parameters and geometries of measured devices ( as described in detail in the next sections ) .",
    "figures  [ fig3saddlepotential]c , d show that the length of the transport channel depends on the applied ratio @xmath12 , and that the narrow gaps between 3 parallel electrodes in qpc@xmath11 devices do not give significant structure on the saddle - point potential in the operation regime that we consider .",
    "the focus of this work is on realizing qpc channels with a tunable length .",
    "the channels are in fact saddle - point potentials ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3saddlepotential ] ) , and it is for such a smooth shape not obvious what the value is of the channel length .",
    "we therefore characterize this channel length with the parameter @xmath7 , which corresponds to the value of the lithographic length @xmath5 of a qpc@xmath10 type device ( with rectangular gate electrodes , see fig .",

    "[ fig1sempic]b and fig .",
    "[ fig3saddlepotential]a for how the @xmath25- and @xmath26-directions are defined ) .",
    "the transverse confinement in the middle of the qpc ( defined as @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) is parabolic to a very good approximation .",
    "when moving out of the channel along the @xmath25-direction , the transverse confinement becomes weaker , but remains at first parabolic .",
    "notably , the energy eigenstates for confinement in such a parabolic potential , described as @xmath45 have a width that is ( for all levels ) proportional to @xmath46 . in this expression @xmath47 is the effective mass of the electron and @xmath48 is the angular frequency of natural oscillations in this potential .",

    "for the range of @xmath5 values that is of interest to our study ( @xmath59100  nm to @xmath59500  nm ) , we find the most reasonable overall agreement between the actual value for @xmath5 ( input to the simulation ) and the value @xmath39 ( derived from the simulation ) for @xmath41 .",
    "the agreement is not perfect , but we analyzed that the deviation is within an uncertainty that we need to assume because the exact shapes of saddle - point potentials in different device geometries do show some variation , and because the limited validity of davies method .",
    "nevertheless , it provides a reasonable recipe for assigning a value @xmath7 to any saddle - point potential , with at most 20% error .",

    "<S> we report on developing split - gate quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) that have a tunable length for the transport channel . </S>",
    "<S> the qpcs were realized in a gaas / algaas heterostructure with a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) below its surface . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional design uses 2 gate fingers on the wafer surface which deplete the 2deg underneath when a negative gate voltage is applied , and this allows for tuning the width of the qpc channel . </S>",
    "<S> our design has 6 gate fingers and this provides additional control over the form of the electrostatic potential that defines the channel . </S>",
    "<S> our study is based on electrostatic simulations and experiments and the results show that we developed qpcs where the effective channel length can be tuned from about 200  nm to 600  nm . </S>",
    "<S> length - tunable qpcs are important for studies of electron many - body effects because these phenomena show a nanoscale dependence on the dimensions of the qpc channel . </S>"
