    "the stripe - type afm order is itinerant , with an ordered fe moment of @xmath15 and an afm propagation vector @xmath16 , which angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy and band structure calculations show is consistent with nesting between hole- and electron - type fermi - surface pockets @xcite .",
    "studies on compounds in which fe is substituted by other transition metals , such as co @xcite , ni @xcite , or cu @xcite , show that the structural and magnetic phase transitions become suppressed at high enough levels of doping , and that superconductivity occurs over a limited range of doping .",

    "data for samples synthesized using sn flux show that @xmath18 to @xmath19 co substitution for fe suppresses the magnetic and structural transitions , @xmath20 to @xmath21 co substitution causes superconductivity to first occur , and @xmath22 to @xmath23 co substitution subsequently suppresses superconductivity @xcite .",

    "the diagrams were created with vesta @xcite ]    under modest applied pressure ( @xmath24  gpa at @xmath25  k ) , cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 undergoes a first - order structural phase transition from its ambient - pressure tetragonal ( t ) or orthorhombic phase to a collapsed - tetragonal ( ct ) phase characterized by an @xmath26 reduction in the ratio of its lattice parameters @xmath27 , a @xmath28 reduction in @xmath6 , and a @xmath21 decrease in its unit - cell volume @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "the ratio of its lattice parameters is @xmath33 @xcite , which is comparable to the value for cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 in the ct phase , @xcite and indicates that caco@xmath11as@xmath3 exists in the ct phase at ambient pressure @xcite .",

    "in addition to the effects of hole doping , the consequences of decreasing the vacancy of the co site with increasing @xmath8 need to be considered .",

    "they also indicate that the total energies of the a - type afm and fm states are similar for both compositions , which points to competition between the two states , regardless of the presence of a @xmath221 vacancy . based on these results and",

    "lastly , we point out that the larger uncertainty in the measured values of @xmath222 for the @xmath223 and @xmath224 samples indicates that the amount of disorder within these compounds is larger than that for other values of @xmath8",
    ". such disorder may obscure the observation of a sharp phase transition , potentially leading to the experimentally observed crossover from the ct to t phase .",
    "finally , we compare the suppression of the a - type afm order in ca(co@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath3 with the sensitivity of ca(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath3as@xmath3 to low levels of strain . for feas - flux grown ca(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath3as@xmath3 , single crystals annealed and then quenched at temperatures between @xmath225c exhibit the low - temperature afm and orthorhombic , and superconducting phases seen for samples grown using sn flux , whereas as - grown crystals quenched from @xmath226c enter the nonmagnetic ct phase upon cooling at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "additionally , the first - order structural phase transition between the high - temperature t and low - temperature ct phases becomes less severe , or rather more continuous , with increasing co concentration , and it is suggested that a critical end point exists , past which a continuous thermal contraction occurs rather than a dramatic first - order transition @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a continuous t - ct phase transition with increasing co concentration appears qualitatively similar to the smooth evolution with increasing @xmath8 from the ct to t phase for ca(co@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath3 .",

    "<S> magnetization , neutron diffraction , and high - energy x - ray diffraction results for sn - flux grown single - crystal samples of ca(co@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , are presented and reveal that a - type antiferromagnetic order , with ordered moments lying along the @xmath6 axis , persists for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic order is smoothly suppressed with increasing @xmath8 , with both the ordered moment and nel temperature linearly decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> stripe - type antiferromagnetic order does not occur for @xmath9 , nor does ferromagnetic order for @xmath8 up to at least @xmath10 , and a smooth crossover from the collapsed - tetragonal ( ct ) phase of caco@xmath11as@xmath3 to the tetragonal ( t ) phase of cafe@xmath3as@xmath3 occurs . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that hole doping caco@xmath11as@xmath3 has a less dramatic effect on the magnetism and structure than steric effects due to substituting sr for ca . </S>"
