    "in this paper , we consider a two - dimensional motion of liquid film of a viscous and incompressible fluid flowing down an inclined plane under the influence of the gravity and the surface tension on the interface .",

    "the boundary condition on the rigid plane is the non - slip condition @xmath30    these equations have a laminar steady solution of the form @xmath31 which is called the nusselt flat film solution . throughout this paper , we assume that the flow is downward @xmath32-periodic or approaches asymptotically this flat film solution at spacially infinity",
    ".    concerning the instability of this laminar flow , there are vast research literatures in the physical and the engineering point of view .",
    "the first investigation of the wave motion of thin film including the effect of the surface tension was provided by kapitza @xcite .",
    "particularly , he considered the case where liquid film flows down a vertical wall , that is , the case @xmath33 .",
    "yih @xcite first formulated the linear stability problem of the laminar flow of liquid film flowing down an inclined plane as an eigenvalue problem for the complex phase velocity , more specifically , the orr - sommerfeld problem although he neglected the effect of the surface tension .",
    "benjamin @xcite took into account the effect of the surface tension and showed that the critical reynolds number @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 by expanding the normal mode solution in powers of @xmath11 .",
    "( in his original paper , the critical reynolds number was given by @xmath36 .",
    "this difference comes from the definition of the reynolds number , that is , benjamin used the average speed of the nusselt flat film solution whereas we use the speed of the solution on the liquid surface as in benney @xcite . )",
    "later , yih @xcite showed the same condition by expanding normal mode solution in powers of the aspect ratio of the film which will be denoted by @xmath0 in this article .",
    "an approach taking into account the nonlinearity was first given by mei @xcite and benney @xcite .",
    "while mei considered the gravity waves , benney considered the capillary - gravity waves and he recovered benjamin s and yih s linear stability theories . using the mean thickness of the liquid @xmath7 , the characteristic scale of the streamwise direction @xmath32 , and the typical amplitude of the liquid surface @xmath37 , benney introduced two non - dimensional parameters @xmath0 and @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 respectively , and derived the following single nonlinear evolution equation @xmath40 by the method of perturbation expansion of the solution @xmath41 with respect to @xmath0 under the thin film regime @xmath1 . here ,",

    "thereafter , several authors have followed the benney s approach . here",
    ", we note that if the weber number @xmath44 satisfies the condition @xmath45 , the effect of the surface tension does not appear until the term of @xmath46 in the above equation .",
    "since benney considered the case @xmath45 and calculated the terms up to @xmath47 , the effect of the surface tension was omitted in his stability analysis .",
    "consequently , his results showed that linearly unstable waves grow more rapidly in the nonlinear range .",
    "nakaya @xcite computed the terms up to @xmath46 and showed that the surface tension has a stabilization effect in the development of the monochromatic waves . on the other hand",
    ", gjevik @xcite incorporated the effect of the surface tension into the equation by assuming the condition @xmath48 and investigated the growth of an initially unstable periodic surface perturbation and its nonlinear interaction with the higher harmonics .",
    "their results imply that the surface tension plays an important role in investigating the stability of surface waves , which have already been pointed out by kapitza @xcite .",
    "we remark that the condition @xmath48 holds for many kinds of fluid such as water and alcohol at normal temperature .",
    "moreover , several authors extended the benney s results to the three - dimensional case .",
    "roskes @xcite calculated the terms up to @xmath47 and investigated the interactions between two - dimensional and three - dimensional weakly nonlinear waves on liquid film under the condition @xmath45 , which implies that he did not consider the effect of the surface tension .",
    "atherton and homsy @xcite and lin and krishna @xcite calculated the terms up to @xmath49 and @xmath47 , respectively , under the condition @xmath48 , namely , they took the effect of surface tension in the equation in three - dimensional case .",
    "furthermore , while they considered the case where @xmath50 , topper and kawahara @xcite derived approximate equations under the conditions @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
    "more details or a list of useful references about the thin film approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "many approximate equations are obtained from .",
    "for example , by neglecting the terms of @xmath52 , we obtain the burgers equation @xmath53 with @xmath54 , from which we can recover the benjamin s critical reynolds number @xmath55 . by neglecting the terms of @xmath56",
    ", we obtain the kdv ",
    "burgers equation @xmath57 which was named by johnson @xcite . here , @xmath58 .",
    "by neglecting the terms of @xmath59 and assuming @xmath60 , we obtain the so - called kdv  kuramoto ",
    "sivashinsky equation or kawahara equation ( see @xcite ) @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "note that the effect of the surface tension , namely , the weber number @xmath44 first appear in the coefficient of the fourth order derivative term in the case @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , by assuming @xmath63 , that is , strongly nonlinear case and @xmath64 and neglecting the terms of @xmath47 , we obtain the so - called benney equation ( see @xcite ) @xmath65_x.\\ ] ] now , our purpose is to give a mathematically rigorous justification of these thin film approximations by establishing the error estimate between the solution of the navier ",
    "stokes equations  and those of the above approximate equations . in order to carry out the justification ,",
    "the most difficult task is to derive a uniform estimate for the solution of the navier  stokes equations with respect to @xmath0 in the thin film regime @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on deriving a uniform estimate of the solution with respect to @xmath0 when the reynolds number , the angle of inclination , and the initial date are sufficiently small under the conditions @xmath66 , @xmath50 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "in the forthcoming paper , we will give a mathematically rigorous justification of the thin film approximations .",
    "we remark that bresch and noble @xcite have already derived a uniform estimate of the solution with respect to @xmath0 by assuming @xmath48 , @xmath51 , @xmath70 , @xmath68 , and that initial data are sufficiently small .",
    "their assumptions on @xmath71 and @xmath13 are too restrictive when we consider the asymptotic behavior of the solution as @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , they assumed @xmath73 and excluded the case of @xmath63 , so that their uniform estimate can not be applied to the justification for the benney equation . therefore , our results are not included in their works .",
    "concerning a mathematical analysis of the problem , teramoto @xcite showed that the initial value problem to the navier ",
    "stokes equations  has a unique solution globally in time under the assumptions that the reynolds number and the initial data are sufficiently small .",
    "nishida , teramoto , and win @xcite showed the exponential stability of the nusselt flat film solution under the assumptions that the angle of inclination is sufficiently small and the flow is downward periodic in addition to the assumptions in @xcite . furthermore , uecker @xcite studied the asymptotic behavior for @xmath74 of the solution in the case of @xmath75 and showed that the perturbations of the nusselt flat film solution decay like the self - similar solution of the burgers equation under the assumptions that the initial data are sufficiently small and @xmath76 .",
    "however , they studied only in the case of @xmath77 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we rewrite the problem in a non - dimensional form and transform the problem in a time dependent domain to a problem in a time independent domain by using an appropriate diffeomorphism .",
    "then , we give our main theorem in this paper . in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out energy estimates to the transformed equations , which are key estimates to derive a uniform boundedness of the solution in @xmath0 . in section 4 ,",
    "we give estimates for the pressure . in section 5",
    ", we estimate nonlinear terms appeared in the right - hand side of the energy inequality .",
