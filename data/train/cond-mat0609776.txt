    "complex networks have proved to be useful tools to explore natural or man - made phenomena as diverse as the internet @xcite , human societies @xcite , transport patterns between airports @xcite or even metabolic reactions in the interior of cells @xcite .",
    "the vertices in the networks represent the elements of the system and the edges the interactions between them .",
    "the study of the topology of the network provides valuable information on how the basic components interact . while the existence or not of an edge is already informative , in many cases , as those listed above",
    ", the interactions can appear on different levels .",
    "the bandwidth between two servers on the internet for instance is not a flat quantity equal for all pairs , it depends on the importance of the servers as well as on the traffic expected .",
    "this fact led to the introduction of weighted graphs as a more accurate way to describe real networks @xcite .",
    "weighted graphs are complex networks where the edges have a magnitude associated , a _ weight_. the weight accounts for the quality of a connection .",
    "the existence of a distribution of weights dramatically alters transport properties of networks like the geometry of the optimal paths @xcite , the spreading of diseases @xcite or the synchronabizability of oscillators @xcite .",
    "most previous studies have been carried out on networks with uncorrelated weights on neighboring edges ( those arriving at the same node ) even though most real cases possess correlation .",
    "our aim here is to check how the presence of correlations can influence these results",
    ".    there may be several kinds of correlations in random graphs @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the edge weights in some real - world networks are related to other properties of the graph such as the degree ( the number of connections a vertex has ) @xcite .",
    "the weights were found to follow , on average , a power law dependence on the degree .",
    "several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed to generate networks of this type @xcite . in this case",
    ", a clear correlation is introduced between the weight of neighboring edges but one may wonder whether this is the only possibility for weight correlations . if not , which other structures are possible ? how can the correlations be quantitatively characterized ? and most importantly , which influence do they have on the transport ?    in this work , we address these questions .",
    "the organization of the manuscript is the following . in the section",
    "ii , we present a model that allows to explore the different configurations for weight correlations independently of other properties of the network .",
    "next , in the section iii , we consider and evaluate different magnitudes to estimate the type and intensity of weight - weight correlations .",
    "section iv includes a study on how the presence of weight correlations affects transport . in section v two examples of real - world networks showing this type of correlations are discussed : the imdb actor collaboration network and the traffic network between us airports . and finally , we conclude and summarize in section vi .",
    "let us start by defining a mathematical framework for the weight correlations . from the point of view of an edge of weight @xmath0 with vertices with degree @xmath1 and @xmath2 at its extremes , the joint probability that its neighboring edges have a certain weight",
    "is given by @xmath3 these functions contain all the information about both degree and weight distributions and correlations .",
    "however , a situation in which a full hierarchy of such functions were needed to characterize the network would be hard to control from an analytical or numerical point of view .",
    "therefore we will focus here only on the simplest scenario . in the same way the markovian condition is a simplifying assumption for stochastic processes",
    ", we will consider only correlations generated by two - point joint probability functions @xmath4 , and , among those , initially only the ones that are degree independent given by functions of the type @xmath5 .        in order to construct weighted networks along these lines",
    ", we use the so - called barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite , where new nodes entering the network connect to old ones with a probability proportional to their degree @xcite .",
    "the networks generated by this model are scale - free ( their degree distribution goes as @xmath6 ) , have no degree - degree correlations , and their clustering coefficient ( probability of finding triangles ) tends to zero when the system size tends to infinity .",
    "all this makes them ideal null models to test correlations between edge weights .",
    "once the network is grown , a joint probability distribution for the link weights @xmath5 and an algorithm for weight assignation are needed . with the function @xmath5",
    "one can calculate the weight distribution @xmath7 , and the conditional probability of having a weight @xmath8 provided that a neighboring link has a weight @xmath0 , @xmath9 .",
    "we start by choosing an edge at random and giving it a weight obtained from @xmath10 .",
    "then we move to the nodes at its extremes and assign weights to the neighboring links . to do this , we follow a recursive method : if the edge from which the node is accessed has a weight @xmath11 , the rest , @xmath12 , are obtained from the conditional distributions @xmath13 .",
    "the recursion is necessary to increase the variability in case of anticorrelation ( see below ) .",
    "if any of the links , @xmath14 , has already a weight , it remains without change and its value affects the subsequent edges @xmath15 .",
    "we repeat this process until all the edges of the network have a weight assigned @xcite .    for @xmath5",
    ", we have considered different possibilities but here we will focus only on the following three : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the normalization factors for the distributions on the domain of weights @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is gauss hyper - geometric function @xcite . without losing generality ,",
    "we have chosen these particular functional forms due to their analytical and numerical tractability .",
    "the distributions generated by eqs .",
    "( [ distr ] ) asymptotically decay as @xmath22 .",
    "the reason to use power - law decaying distributions is that empirical networks commonly show very wide weight distributions that in a first approach can be modeled as power - laws ( see fig .",
    "6 and refs .",
    "we name the functions as @xmath23 ( positively correlated ) , @xmath24 ( anticorrelated ) and u ( uncorrelated ) because the average weight , @xmath25 , obtained with the conditional probabilities from a certain seed @xmath11 grows as @xmath26 , decreases as @xmath27 and remains constant @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this means that in @xmath23 networks the links of each node tend to be relatively uniform in the weights ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , with separate areas of the graph concentrating the strong or the weak links , while in the negative case links with high and low weights are heavily mixed .    from a numerical point of view",
    ", we have checked how the variables to measure vary with the network size @xmath29 . in the following ,",
    "most results are shown for @xmath30 , which is big enough to avoid significant finite size effects .",
    "for each value of the exponent @xmath31 ( from eqs .",
    "( [ distr ] ) ) and for each type of correlations , we have averaged over more than @xmath32 realizations . note that we use @xmath31 as a control parameter for the strength of the correlations . for high values of @xmath31",
    ", @xmath10 decays very fast and the correlations become negligible , all links have almost the same weight .",
    "when @xmath31 decreases however , the higher moments of @xmath10 diverge and one would expect the correlations to be more prominent .",
    "( diamonds ) , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ( circles ) for the `` + '' distribution model as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the highlighted area encloses the resolution limit of the estimators .",
    "the rate @xmath33 is shown for several values of @xmath35 : @xmath36 ( squares ) , @xmath37 ( up triangles ) and @xmath38 ( down triangles ) . ]",
    "after a look at the sketch of fig .",
    "1 , the first estimator to consider in order to estimate weight correlations is the standard deviation of the weights of the links arriving at each node",
    ". if the weights are relatively homogeneous , the standard deviation will be lower compared with its counterpart in a randomized instance of the graph .",
    "the opposite will happen if the correlations are negative as in the case b of fig .",
    "1 . more specifically , for a generic node of the network @xmath39 , @xmath40 can be defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the set of neighbors of @xmath39 and @xmath43 is the mean value of the weight of the links arriving at @xmath39 .",
    "once the deviation is calculated for each node , an average can be taken over the full network getting @xmath44 .",
    "then to evaluate the effects of weight correlations , it is necessary to compare the value of @xmath45 obtained for the original network with that measured on uncorrelated graphs .",
    "it is , of course , important that the statistical properties of such uncorrelated graphs are as close as possible to those of the original graph .",
    "the most accurate procedure consists in disordering only the weights of the links of the original network . to do so ,",
    "we interchange the weight of each link with that of a randomly selected edge preserving so the weight distribution @xmath10 and the network topology ; @xmath46 , degree distribution , degree - degree correlation , clustering , etc , remain invariant . once @xmath47 is estimated for the original graph and for an ensemble of weight - reshuffled instances of it , the rate @xmath48 can be calculated .",
    "if @xmath49 , the weight correlations in the original graph will be as in the case b of fig 1 .",
    "if it is identically one , there will be no weight correlations and if @xmath50 the correlations will be as in fig .",
    "the behavior of @xmath51 for the positive and negative models proposed in the previous section is displayed in fig .",
    "the first thing to remark is that indeed @xmath51 can distinguish between the three cases .",
    "moreover , it provides a first method to quantitatively estimate of the intensity of the weight correlations .    , from bottom to top @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the straight line has slope @xmath54 and is meant as a guide to the eye .",
    "the triplets have been shifted upwards to facilitate visibility .",
    "the inset shows the disparity versus @xmath1 for the @xmath55 case and for the values of @xmath31 from bottom to top @xmath56 and @xmath53 . ]",
    "a similar result can be obtained with a magnitude that was previously discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "its name is _ disparity _ and was introduced in the context of weighted graphs by barthlemy _",
    "_ as a way to estimate how homogeneous the weights of the links arriving at a vertex are .",
    "the generalized disparity of node @xmath39 , @xmath57 , is defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the strength of @xmath39 , @xmath60 .",
    "if all the links of a node have a similar weight , their value will be @xmath61 , and therefore the disparity decays as @xmath62 .",
    "on the other hand , if the vertex strength is essentially due to the weight of a single link , @xmath63 will tend to a constant .",
    "typically instead of a generalized @xmath64 , most of the works in the literature has focused on @xmath65 , for which is commonly reserve the name of disparity .",
    "this latter magnitude can be related to @xmath66 by the following expression for each node @xmath39 of the network @xmath67 where @xmath43 is the average weight of the links of @xmath39 and @xmath68 its degree .",
    "an important question to mention here is that the profiles of @xmath63 depend on the weight distribution , even for completely uncorrelated graphs .",
    "@xmath57 provides information on how different the weights of the links of @xmath39 are but not on whether that particular configuration is or not a product of randomness or correlations .",
    "the variation of @xmath69 with the exponent of the weight distribution @xmath31 for the uncorrelated @xmath55-model can be seen in the inset of figure 3 . in the same figure",
    ", we also show the behavior of @xmath69 for the other two models , `` @xmath23 '' and `` @xmath24 '' , for a few values of the exponent @xmath31 .",
    "as before , in order to estimate the importance of the weight correlations , the disparity of the correlated graph has to be compared with that obtained from uncorrelated networks . to express this comparison in a single rate , we can take the average of the disparity over all nodes of the network , @xmath70 , and calculate @xmath71 the value of @xmath33 for the positive model as a function of @xmath31 is displayed in fig .",
    "2 . this magnitude is also able to discriminate between the different correlations .     on the exponent @xmath31 for the positively correlated graphs generated with the `` + '' distribution of eq .",
    "( [ distr ] ) . in the inset , the same function but for the graphs of the `` - '' distribution . ]",
    "however , both @xmath72 and @xmath33 have resolution problems .",
    "as can be seen in figure 2 for the positive model , if an area enclosing the numeric error is set immediately below one , the estimators @xmath72 , @xmath33 fall in turn relatively fast in that zone .",
    "the weights of the links in the `` + '' model are continuous variables and therefore they are always correlated . although , as explained before , for higher values of @xmath31 the effects of weight correlations can be weaker but still until @xmath31 is not infinite they are not zero .",
    "an ideal estimator should be able to distinguish the @xmath23 model from a complete random configuration at very high values of @xmath31 . in this context",
    ", @xmath51 seems to be the worst estimator .",
    "@xmath33 is better than @xmath51 and improves the higher @xmath35 becomes .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that these magnitudes are not only estimating how wide the spectrum of values of @xmath0 for a node is , they also supply information on the shape of the distribution of those values . as an example , let us consider a node with @xmath1 links . the value of @xmath66 is higher if @xmath73 of them have weight @xmath74 and the remaining weight @xmath75 , @xmath76 , than if the distribution is more symmetric , let us say , with half of them with @xmath77 and the other half with weight @xmath75 , @xmath78 .",
    "the goal here is to study how different the amplitude of the weight values is compared with a random configuration of weights , hence the extra information contained in @xmath66 or @xmath64 can be neglected .",
    "an ideal estimator for weight correlations only needs to consider the interval @xmath79 .",
    "following this idea , we define the _ range _ for a node @xmath39 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are respectively the maximum and minimum weights of the edges of @xmath39 .",
    "the denominator is a normalization factor to keep @xmath83 between zero and one .",
    "note that @xmath84 has a similar behavior to @xmath64 in the limit @xmath85 : if all the weights are equal @xmath86 , and also @xmath87 if @xmath85 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the weight of link dominates the others @xmath88 , @xmath89 too if @xmath85 .",
    "as before , to generate a correlations estimator , the average of @xmath83 , @xmath90 , can be taken over all the nodes of the network and contrasted with the equivalent value obtained from a set of weight - reshuffled instances .",
    "we will call @xmath34 to the rate between these two quantities , @xmath91 if @xmath92 , the network displays positive weight correlations . the stronger they are , the smaller @xmath34 becomes .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath93 , the weights are anticorrelated .",
    "@xmath94 is the limit of uncorrelated networks . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath34 is a much more acute estimator of weight correlations than @xmath33 or @xmath72 .",
    "hence , from now on we will present our results as function of it .",
    "the variation of @xmath34 with @xmath31 is displayed in fig .",
    "4 for the `` @xmath23 '' and `` @xmath24 '' models .",
    "the intensity of the correlations for the `` @xmath23 '' model grows when @xmath95 ( @xmath96 decreases for smaller @xmath31 ) , while for the negative case @xmath97 initially grows , peaks around @xmath98 and then tends to one again for smaller @xmath31 .",
    "another question that we are now in position to board is in which way a relation between weight and degree affects the weight - weight correlations . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "networks of this kind may display quite different transport properties from their unweighted counterparts @xcite .",
    "usually , the weights of these networks are obtained by means of a relation of the kind @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the result is that provided that the degree is an `` _ a - priori _ ''",
    "characteristic that equally influence all the edges of a vertex , the weight of the links is positively correlated .",
    "the networks created in this way show correlations similar to our `` @xmath23 '' model ( regardless of the sign of the exponent @xmath100 ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , for @xmath101 the value of @xmath34 is in both cases @xmath102 .",
    "let us focus now on the transport and how it varies with the presence of weight - weight correlations .",
    "several measures have been proposed to study transport @xcite . in this work",
    "we will concentrate on the size and weight of the `` _ superhighways _ '' as recently introduced by wu _",
    "if the edges of an uncorrelated network are severed following an increasing order from small to higher weights , the percolation threshold is eventually reached . the remaining connected graph after the process is over , the incipient percolation cluster ( iic ) or superhighways , holds most of the traffic of the original network . regarding this procedure",
    ", there are several questions to mention .",
    "first , along this work we have assumed that higher weights imply better transport properties .",
    "this is also the case for the two empirical examples discussed below ; the weights represent number of passengers in one network and number of collaborations done together in the other .",
    "however , for some other graphs , the weights can mean higher resistance to transport . and ,",
    "therefore , the superhighways must be obtained with the same procedure but cutting the links with highest weights first . in such circumstances , the lower the total weight of the superhighway is , the better the transport results .    , and the change in the weight of the superhighways for the positively correlated networks generated with the `` + '' model of eq .",
    "( [ distr ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath31 go from @xmath103 for the first point on the left to @xmath104 in middle changing regularly by @xmath105 for each point .",
    "the last point of the right hand side is for @xmath106 . ]",
    "another question is that the percolation threshold depends on the topological characteristics of the network . for uncorrelated undirected graphs ,",
    "it is attained when in the process of severing random links , the rate @xmath107 of the remaining graph approaches two , @xmath108 @xcite . for directed networks or networks with _ high clustering _",
    ", the threshold does obey different expressions @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will further discuss this point as well as the numerical determination of the percolation threshold for our two empirical networks .",
    "finally , it is worthy noting that this method to estimate superhighways can not be applied directly to networks with weight correlations . if the high weight links are concentrated in some areas of the graph , cutting the weak links is not going to affect those areas .",
    "this can change the percolation criterion , i.e. @xmath109 can not be used , although the percolation threshold that depends solely on the topology remains the same as in an uncorrelated graph .",
    "the goal in our case is to compare graphs with and without weight correlations and to quantitatively estimate the effects of these correlations .",
    "the method used in practice is to disorder the weights of the links of each correlated network .",
    "then we estimate the superhighways of the randomized graphs and measure how many edges must be cut on average to attain the percolation threshold .",
    "reaching the percolation may have some numerical problems @xcite so the process of reshuffling the weights must be repeated several times .",
    "next , we cut the same number of links in the correlated network ( again going from lower to higher values of @xmath0 ) and compare the size and the weight of the biggest remaining connected cluster ( @xmath110 ) with the average of those found for the randomized graphs .",
    "in this way , we obtain @xmath111 the results , displayed in fig .",
    "5 , show that , in general , positive correlations play a decisive role on the value of @xmath110 , increasing it by orders of magnitude .",
    "the smaller is @xmath34 respect to the unit , the stronger the effect of the weight correlations on the transport becomes .",
    "this phenomenon may be understood by keeping the analogy with the roads : the transport improves if the highways are connected together forming a communication backbone as large as possible .",
    "anticorrelated networks , on the other hand , exhibit smaller superhighways than their randomized counterparts although the effect is subtle .",
    "so far we have discussed models for which the weight correlations are independent of other structural factors . in general , there may be other aspects influencing the transport properties of a graph .",
    "if several compete , as it happens in the case @xmath112 , with @xmath113 , between the degree and the weight of the connections of a node , the transport capability of the network may suffer .",
    "for example , we measure @xmath114 for networks of size @xmath30 and @xmath115 , while @xmath116 if @xmath117 .     for imdb actor collaboration network .",
    "in the bottom , in b ) , the clustering as a function of the degree .",
    "the line below corresponds to the function @xmath118.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for imdb actor collaboration network . in the bottom , in b ) , the clustering as a function of the degree .",
    "the line below corresponds to the function @xmath118.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "finally , we also consider a couple of real - world examples .",
    "first the imdb movie database with @xmath119 actors that are connected together whenever they have shared a common movie @xcite .",
    "this network is formed by the union of cliques , which means that the number of links is high , @xmath120 in total .",
    "the weight of each link represents the number of times a partnerships has been repeated .",
    "higher values of the weight imply an increased probability of information transfer between two individuals .",
    "the cumulative distribution of weights for this network can be seen in figure 6a .",
    "it shows a very wide functional form that can be well represented by a power - law .",
    "the presence of weight correlations in collaboration networks have been discussed using a different technique in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the results obtained with @xmath34 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "first of all , it is important to note that collaboration networks typically do not show a relation between the weight of the links defined in this way , or as _ social closeness _",
    "@xcite , and the degree of the nodes @xcite . hence the weight correlations ,",
    "if exist , are not a product of this type of relation . and , indeed , they exist since the actor network presents a value of @xmath123 .     for the actor collaboration networks . in the inset ,",
    "the same quantity but in log - log and versus @xmath124 .",
    "three values of @xmath125 are displayed : @xmath126 ( triangles up ) , @xmath127 ( circles ) and @xmath128 ( triangles down ) . ]",
    "the measure of the superhighways in this case poses a certain level of challenge .",
    "the actor collaboration network , as many social networks , presents high clustering .",
    "the clustering of a node @xmath39 is defined as @xmath129 where @xmath59 is the number of connections between the neighbors of @xmath39 and @xmath68 stands for its degree .",
    "the average over all the nodes of the network with the same degree @xmath1 can be then taken to obtain @xmath130 , which is depicted in figure 6b for this network . in the same plot ,",
    "it is also included the curve @xmath118 .",
    "the comparison is necessary because it has been recently shown that the percolation threshold of a graph is highly dependent on the clustering @xcite .",
    "in fact , clustered networks can be classified into two major groups : those with _",
    "weak _ and those with _ strong _ clustering .",
    "the difference between the two groups is whether @xmath130 decays as @xmath118 ( weak clustering ) or in a slower way ( strong ) .",
    "the actor network clearly falls into this latter group .    for weak clustered networks ,",
    "it is possible to find a generalization of the percolation threshold condition mentioned in the previous section ( @xmath131 ) @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we know , nothing similar has been proposed for strong clustered graphs .",
    "therefore , we will be force to use a more pedestrian technique to estimate the percolation threshold of the actor collaboration network . in figure 7",
    ", the behavior of the rate between the size of the giant component @xmath132 and its original value @xmath133 is displayed as a function of the percentage of links severed @xmath35 .",
    "a continuous transition can be observed with this rate as order parameter .",
    "assuming functional form of the type @xmath134 , we find that the critical point happens at a remotion rate of @xmath135 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "the point in which the condition @xmath136 is fulfilled , for instance , lies in a smaller value @xmath137 .",
    "once @xmath138 has been measured , we can proceed as in the previous section , cutting a fraction @xmath138 of links following an ordered sequence from lower to higher values of the weight and comparing the results with those obtained for a graph in which the weights of the links have been reshuffled .",
    "the rates for the total weight of the superhighways for a few values of @xmath35 are @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . as can be seen , finding the value of @xmath121",
    "requires a fine determination of @xmath138 .",
    "even so , the high values of this rate gives us a clear feeling of the importance that the weight correlations have on the transport properties of these real world graphs .",
    "the values of @xmath122 that we find for the same removal rates @xmath35 are @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "the second example is a network composed by @xmath145 us airports .",
    "a directed edge connects two airports whenever there is a direct flight between them .",
    "the weight of the links represent in this case the number of passengers on that traject during @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the cumulative weight distribution of this network is displayed in figure 8 .",
    "the weight distribution is in this case also wide , although clearly it does not follow a power - law decay .",
    "as can be seen in the inset of that figure , the average weight of the outgoing links exhibits a dependence on the out - degree of the nodes , @xmath147 .",
    "therefore it is not strange that the value of @xmath34 that we measure , @xmath148 , delates the presence of positive weight correlations .",
    "since the number of passengers in each direction can be different , to calculate the superhighways it is necessary to generalize the concept to directed graphs .",
    "this means to study the incipient strongly connected component ( scc ) instead of the incipient percolation cluster .",
    "applying the same technique as the one illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , we get a value for the critical removal of @xmath149 .",
    "the corresponding rate @xmath121 is @xmath150 .",
    "in summary , we have explored how correlations between neighboring edge weights can occur in random networks .",
    "the high ( low ) weights can appear concentrated in certain areas of the graph , a configuration that has a considerable effect on transport properties . to study this phenomenon ,",
    "we have proposed a simple method to introduce weight correlations in otherwise uncorrelated graphs .",
    "these models show that weight correlations can appear independently of any other property of the network , although they could be also coupled to some characteristic of the vertices such as the degree , hidden variables , etc .",
    "this method allow us to study , not only qualitatively but also quantitatively , the type and intensity of these correlations .",
    "leading us to test several estimators : @xmath66 , the generalized disparity and the range @xmath34 , being the latter the best of the three .",
    "once we found a tool to measure the intensity of weight correlations , we have focused on how the transport properties of the network become affected by these correlations .",
    "the so called superhighways of our model `` @xmath23 '' have been studied as a function of the intensity of weight correlations .",
    "the conclusion , that seems to be generalizable to other networks , is that stronger ( positive ) correlations imply bigger and weightier superhighways , improving thus the performance of the network on transport in orders magnitude .    finally , we have also considered data from two real - world networks , a collaboration graph and a transportation ( airports ) network . both cases present positive weight - weight correlations . the results on their superhighways ,",
    "@xmath121 , also prove that weight correlations are without doubt an important factor to take into account in the study of transport on real networks .",

    "<S> we study non degree dependent correlations between edge weights , generalizing thus the correlations beyond the degree dependent case . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple method to introduce weight - weight correlations in topologically uncorrelated graphs . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to test different measures to discriminate between the different correlation types and to quantify their intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss here the effect of weight correlations on the transport properties of the networks , showing that positive correlations dramatically improve transport . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give two examples of real - world networks ( social and transport graphs ) in which weight - weight correlations are present . </S>"
