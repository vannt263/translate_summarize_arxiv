    "even after two decades of intensive efforts , the normal state properties of the cuprate superconductors in the intermediate range of hole doping , called underdoping , are still poorly understood.@xcite at low doping , close to the undoped antiferromagnetic phase,@xcite the behavior of the system is influenced by the parent mott insulator . at doping level above that corresponding to the maximum superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the mobile holes in the normal state constitute a fermi liquid.taillefer however , at the doping range intermediate between these two limits , the system evinces a gap in the spectrum of unidentified origin ( pseudogap ) below a temperature scale @xmath2 .",
    "many properties of the system in this phase , called the pseudogap phase , are strongly influenced by the gap , which is , similar to the superconducting gap below @xmath1 , anisotropic in the momentum space .",
    "an understanding of the pseudogap , and the associated loss of the spectral weight from the fermi surface , is widely believed to hold the key to the high transition temperature in the cuprates.@xcite the existence of the gap , even in the absence of super - conduction above @xmath1 , have led many theorists to propose exotic non - fermi - liquid states to be responsible for the pseudogap in the cuprates .",
    "however , recent quantum oscillation experiments  doiron - leyraud:2007,leboeuf:2007,bangura:2008,jaudet:2008,yelland:2008,sebastian:2008 have found evidence of fermi pockets even in the enigmatic pseudogap phase .",
    "this has rekindled the encouraging prospect of describing this phase in terms of a state with a broken symmetry and a reconstructed fermi surface,@xcite treating its hole- and electron - like low energy quasiparticles within a well - defined fermi - liquid - like description .",
    "note that the fermi arc picture , as observed in the angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments , @xcite and the fermi pocket picture inferred from quantum oscillation are at odds with each other , constituting a major puzzle in the field .",
    "there have been many density wave scenarios in which the coherence factors involved in arpes , but not in quantum oscillation calculations , destroy half of the pockets , giving the appearance of a fermi arc .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , arpes has also revealed the existence of pockets in some recent experiments .",
    "meng , yang    one of the important unsettled questions about the pseudogap phase concerns the low temperature nernst effect .",
    "the nernst effect experiments measure the transverse electric field response of a system to a combination set - up of an externally - imposed temperature gradient and an orthogonal magnetic field .",
    "early experiments @xcite on the nernst effect in the cuprates revealed a very large signal ( compared to that of a fermi liquid ) near @xmath3 , which is expected because of the presence of the large number of mobile vortices at these temperatures .",
    "the large signal , however , appeared to onset at a temperature far above @xmath3 , leading to speculations that there are well - defined , vortex - type , excitations even at such high temperatures .",
    "more recent experiments @xcite have claimed to find two peaks in the temperature dependence of the nernst coefficient , one arising from the onset of a density wave order in the pseudogap phase , and the other due to the onset of the superconducting phase .",
    "there is also recent evidence of finding a weak peak in the nernst signal in the pseudogap phase whose sign is opposite to that expected from the vortex - like excitations.@xcite these recent developments , therefore , point to the importance of the quasiparticle nernst effect associated with an underlying density wave state in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates .",
    "while the experimental scenario still needs to be settled , in this paper we deduce the full temperature and doping dependence of the quasiparticle nernst effect associated with the @xmath0-density wave state,@xcite which has otherwise shown encouraging consistency with the anomalous phenomenology of the underdoped cuprates .    since the pseudogap has a @xmath0-wave symmetry , one natural density wave state which could explain it is the @xmath4-density wave state.@xcite indeed , much of the phenomenology of the cuprates in the underdoped regime can be unified chakravarty01,sumanta , chakravarty04 by making a single assumption that the ordered ddw state is responsible for the pseudogap .",
    "the development of the ddw order below optimal doping can lead to a consistent explanation of numerous experimental observations including the abrupt suppression of the superfluid density , @xcite and hall number @xcite below optimal doping as well as the more recent quantum oscillation experiments . @xcite theoretically speaking , any appropriate hamiltonian that leads to @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the underdoped regime of the cuprates will almost certainly favor ddw order as well .",
    "@xcite the ddw order might also have been directly observed in two polarized neutron scattering experiments,@xcite even though some other experiments failed to observe it.@xcite the ordered ambipolar ddw state@xcite and its associated fermi surface topology ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pockets ] ) are also qualitatively consistent with the quantum oscillation experiments in the pseudogap regime .",
    "the quantum oscillation experiments indicate that the fermi surface in the underdoped cuprates is made up of small reconstructed fermi pockets , giving rise to both hole and electron - like charge carriers ( quasiparticle ambipolarity ) in the excitation spectrum .",
    "such a feature is quite robust for the ddw state , in which , for generic values of the band structure and gap parameters , the low energy spectrum consists of both electron and hole - like quasiparticles ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pockets ] ) .",
    "we will derive the implications of the above important new ingredient in the cuprate physics on the quasiparticle nernst coefficient of the ddw state .",
    "using quasiclassical boltzmann theory of transport , we will show that the reconstructed fermi surface in the ddw state and its low energy quasiparticle ambipolarity can successfully explain the enhanced nernst signals as found in the experiments at temperatures much above @xmath1 .",
    "wang1,lee2,wang2,olivier even though strong electronic interactions present in the host material are crucial for the formation of the ddw state , @xcite deep in the ordered state the quasiparticles can be assumed to be non - interacting ( or weakly - interacting ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the boltzmann theory is still applicable to calculate the transport properties of the quasiparticles in the presence of a well - developed ddw order parameter .    by a combination of analytical and numerical arguments ,",
    "we show that a low - temperature peak in the nernst coefficient is very robust in the ambipolar @xmath0-density wave state .",
    "in fact , the existence of the peak is solely due to the dominance of the two types of quasiparticles ( electron and hole ) at different regimes of temperatures , and is insensitive to the microscopic details .",
    "therefore , quasiparticle ambipolarity of the underlying state , as indicated in the quantum oscillation experiments , is also crucial for the low temperature peak in the nernst coefficient .",
    "we also find that the sign of the peak of the nernst effect can be positive or negative depending on the dominance of the electron or hole pockets , respectively , in the low temperature thermoelectric transport . by modeling the pseudogap by a suitable , doping - dependent , @xmath0-density wave order parameter",
    ", we analyze the doping dependent evolution of the nernst effect at a fixed low temperature in a range of hole - concentrations in the underdoped regime of the cuprate phase diagram .",
    "the quasiparticle nernst effect has also been recently studied @xcite within the stripe order @xcite model of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the commensurate ddw state and the corresponding hartree - fock hamiltonian .",
    "section iii gives a brief description of the nernst coefficient .",
    "section iv is devoted to the temperature dependence of the nernst coefficient .",
    "we find , both numerically and analytically , that there is a positive peak of the nernst signal for the ambipolar ddw state when the electron pocket dominates the transport at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , there is no such peak of the nernst effect if the underlying state is non - ambipolar .",
    "in fact , the nernst signal from individual electron or hole pockets are both negative , while the combination of them can lead to a positive peak . in section",
    "v , we discuss the doping dependence of the nernst coefficient",
    ". a positive peak in the nernst signal as a function of hole doping is also found . finally , we summarize and conclude in section vi .    the main assumptions ( to be explained in more detail below ) we use to derive the results of this paper are : 1 ) boltzmann theory is applicable to calculate the transport properties of the ddw quasiparticles , 2 ) the transport scattering lifetimes @xmath5 ( eqs .",

    "the third assumption , that of quasiparticle ambipolarity , is the most crucial one for the qualitative robustness of the temperature and doping - dependent peaks in the ddw nernst coefficient .",
    "even though the existence of both types of quasiparticles as in the ambipolar ddw state is likely not the only explanation of either the quantum oscillation experiments or the recent observation of negative hall coefficients at low @xmath6 in the underdoped cuprates , @xcite the ambipolar ddw state ( with a specific fermi surface topology given in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pockets ] ) ) is at least one possible scenario consistent with both of these experiments . as such",
    ", the nernst calculations in this paper within the ambipolar ddw model give at least one possible explanation of the enhanced nernst signals in the underdoped regime of the cuprates .",
    "a part of the results ( numerical calculation for the temperature dependence of the nernst coefficient ) contained in this paper were published earlier .",
    "@xcite in addition to giving a more complete discussion of these previously published results , the present paper contains the following new results : 1 ) an analytical explanation for the peak in the temperature dependence of the nernst signal , 2 ) a fact that even though both electron and hole pockets can give negative nernst effects individually , the combination of them can yield a positive peak as a function of temperature and 3 ) the full doping dependence of the ddw nernst coefficient in the underdoped regime of the cuprates .",
    "specifically , we show that there is a well - defined positive peak in the ddw nernst coefficient as a function of hole doping , which is consistent with the underdoped regime in the cuprate phase diagram .",
    "the commensurate ddw state @xcite is described by an order parameter which is a particle - hole singlet in spin space , @xmath7here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electron creation and annihilation operators on the square lattice of the copper atoms , @xmath10 is the two - dimensional momentum , @xmath11 is the wave vector of the density wave , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spin indices . for simplicity ,",

    "for such a temperature gradient , and with a magnetic field @xmath40 along the @xmath41 direction , the charge current due to quasiparticles along @xmath39 driven by @xmath38 produces a balancing electric field @xmath42 .",
    "the total charge current in the presence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 is thus given by , @xmath44 where @xmath45  and @xmath46 are the electric and the thermoelectric conductivity tensors , respectively .",

    "an important hint regarding this can be obtained from the recent hall effect experiments in ref .  .",

    "@xmath70 is large and positive above @xmath71 , which is consistent with the systems being moderately hole doped .",

    "( [ eq : xy],[eq : xx ] ) , we can calculate the contributions of the electron and hole pockets of the ddw state to the normal state hall coefficient .",
    "the magnitudes of the individual contributions depend on the size and curvature of the respective pockets , but in our calculations the sign of the contribution is positive for the hole - like quasiparticles and negative for the electron - like quasiparticles . for @xmath61 , in which case",
    "the formula for @xmath70 is independent of the scattering time , and for a generic set of parameters ( @xmath73 ) consistent with the quantum oscillation experiments in ybco , @xcite the size and curvature of the hole pockets are much bigger than those of the electron pocket .",
    "this implies that , for @xmath74 , the sign of the overall @xmath70 is positive .",
    "@xcite we have checked that reasonable modifications of the band structure parameters in the cuprate phase diagram can not change this result .",
    "therefore , within the boltzmann theory of transport , the only source of the strong @xmath6-dependence of @xmath75 , as observed in the experiments , must come from the unequal temperature dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath59 . if at high temperatures ( @xmath76 ) @xmath77 , the hall coefficient is positive . on the other hand , if @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath70 can become negative at low @xmath6 .",
    "note that a higher mobility of the electron - like quasiparticles at low @xmath6 is also consistent with the frequency observed in the quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "leboeuf:2007,chakravarty:2008b an independent , microscopic , justification of the higher lifetime of the electron - like quasiparticles at low @xmath6 and in the presence of a magnetic field also follows by considering the scattering of both types of quasiparticles by vortices at low temperatures .",
    "stephen because of the difference of the effective masses between the ddw quasiparticles near the antinodal and the nodal regions in the brillouin zone , the electron lifetime due to vortex scattering can be significantly higher than the hole lifetime at low @xmath6 in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    on the above grounds , we choose the minimal @xmath6-dependence of the scattering times : @xmath80 and @xmath81 even though such a linear @xmath6-dependence of the scattering times is nominally consistent with the linear @xmath6-dependence of the resistivity in a regime close to the optimal doping in the cuprate phase diagram , we emphasize that our motivation for the assumptions about @xmath57 and @xmath58 is strictly phenomenological . with these choices , the calculated @xmath82 for the ambipolar ddw state as a function of @xmath6 with an assumed mean field @xmath6-dependence of the ddw order parameter",

    "the linear @xmath139 dependence of @xmath115 and @xmath116 comes from the region around the hot spots which satisfies @xmath145which has a size @xmath146 . since the relevant integration region is itself @xmath147 , by expanding the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xy ] ) to zeroth order in @xmath139 , we get the leading @xmath139 dependence of @xmath115 as , @xmath148the above is negative since @xmath149 on the surface of rbz .",
    "therefore , it follows that , @xmath150 . from similar manipulations , it is straightforward to show that @xmath151 .",
    "we also note that , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sign ] ) , @xmath152 itself is positive for the hole pockets ( @xmath152 has the same sign as the fermi surface integral for the hall conductivity , @xmath115 , which is , of course , positive for the hole pockets ) . furthermore , noting that @xmath153 and @xmath154 for the hole pocket , we infer from eq .",

    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sign0 ] ) , @xmath156 for @xmath102 . finally , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative ] ) , we conclude that @xmath157 is negative definite for the hole pockets .",
    "this implies that , for only hole - type quasiparticles in the ddw state , the temperature - derivative of the nernst coefficient can never be zero : there is no low temperature peak of @xmath158 .",
    "this analytical result has been confirmed by the numerical results , as seen in fig .",
    "fig : nersep .",
    "in contrast to @xmath135 , the sign of @xmath159 is hard to determine analytically .",
    "the reason is that , in @xmath160 the terms @xmath161 and @xmath162 have opposite signs , and the sign of @xmath159 should be determined by the relative magnitudes of these two terms . for the band structure parameters used here , we find that @xmath159 is negative , as seen in fig .",
    "fig : nersep .",
    "this implies that , for the electron pocket , the second term in @xmath163 dominates over the first one , leading to a positive @xmath163 .      in view of the above analysis , a natural question is then why two individually negative contributions from the electron and the hole pockets ` add up ' to a positive nernst signal at low temperatures when the two types of pockets coexist . the underlying reason can be most clearly expressed by writing down the formula for @xmath164 , where the superscript ` t ' now represents the total nernst effect as given by multiplying @xmath164 by @xmath165 , @xmath166here , @xmath167 and @xmath168 . because of the ambipolar spectrum , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reason ] ) is much smaller than the first one ( since the total hall conductivity , @xmath169 , is small ) , and the sign of @xmath164 is entirely determined by the first term .",
    "it follows that if the contribution from the electron pocket dominates over that from the hole pocket , then @xmath164 is negative , since the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reason ] ) is negative for the electron pocket . on the other hand ,",
    "if the contribution from the hole pocket is greater than that from the electron pocket , then @xmath170 is positive because @xmath171 is positive for the hole pocket , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdu ] . in our calculations ,",
    "the former is the situation at low @xmath6 , and @xmath68 is positive at low temperatures . at high temperatures , the contribution from",
    "the hole pockets dominates transport because of their larger size and the first term in eq .",
    "( eq : reason ) , and consequently @xmath164 , becomes positive , leading to a negative nernst signal .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 , which is zero at @xmath172 , first increases at low temperatures and then decreases at high temperatures , yielding a positive peak if there are both electron- and hole - type quasiparticles present in the spectrum at the same time . in the context of the cuprates , at low temperatures , the electron pocket dominates via @xmath173 , and @xmath174 . on the other hand , at high temperatures , the hole pockets",
    "dominate when @xmath77 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath175 . in practice , determining an analytical expression for the peak temperature by solving the implicit equation , @xmath176 , is not very illuminating , since it depends on many parameters .",
    "however , we have conclusively shown here that the existence of a low temperature positive peak in the nernst coefficient is a robust consequence of quasiparticle ambipolarity , and , therefore , is independent of any assumptions about the microscopic parameters .",
    "furthermore , the sign of the peak value of @xmath177 depends on the relative dominance of the electron and the hole pockets at different regimes of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , if the hole ( electron ) pockets were dominant at low ( high ) temperatures , the peak value of @xmath177 would be negative .",
    "however , in the experimentally relevant case where the electron pocket is more dominant at low @xmath6 ( so that the zero temperature hall coefficient is negative ) , the peak is on the positive side .",
    "to calculate the nernst coefficient as a function of doping in the underdoped regime , we have to start by assuming a phenomenological doping dependence of the ddw order parameter @xmath139 . using the values of the doping - dependent amplitude of the ddw order parameter and the set of parameters @xmath178",
    ", we can calculate the chemical potential @xmath21 as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "this way , the nernst coefficient can be calculated as a function of the doping in the pseudogap phase .    .",

    ". this kind of a doping dependence is physically motivated , since we expect the ddw order to gradually weaken for both high and low values of @xmath32 .",
    "we choose @xmath182 and @xmath183 as the minimum and the maximum doping where the ddw order may exist .",
    "we use the value of @xmath32 and the set of parameters @xmath184 to self - consistently calculate the value of @xmath21 , which determines the size and curvature of the hole and the electron pockets .",
    ", at a fixed low temperature , @xmath185 k , versus the hole doping @xmath32 for the ambipolar ddw state .",
    "nernst coefficient in v k@xmath97t@xmath97 can be derived by multiplying @xmath98 with the factor @xmath132 nv / kt .",
    "the temperature is in @xmath103 .",
    "nernst coefficient shows a pronounced peak at a hole doping @xmath35 , where the ddw order parameter is assumed to be the largest .",
    "the sign of @xmath98 near its peak is positive . ]    to illustrate the behavior of @xmath68 with underdoping , we plot in fig .",
    "( [ fig : nernstt2 ] ) the temperature dependence of @xmath68 for @xmath37 .",
    "it is clear that the nernst signal remains negative in a wider range of temperatures at this value of hole - doping than that at @xmath35 .",
    "however , there is still a small low temperature peak in the positive side because of the larger mobility of the electron pocket at low temperatures .",
    "since the nernst effect at temperatures close to and below the superconducting @xmath1 is almost entirely dominated by the vortex nernst signal , the low temperature positive peak due to the ddw quasiparticles may not be visible in the experiments . in this case",
    ", the ddw quasiparticle nernst effect may appear negative above the superconducting @xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig : nernstx ] ) , we plot the nernst coefficient at a fixed low temperature as a function of hole doping @xmath32 . to construct this plot , we have taken the transition temperature of the ordered ddw state to scale with the value of the zero temperature order parameter , as would be expected from the mean field theory .",
    "this implies that @xmath186 has been determined via @xmath187it is clear that there is a peak of the nernst signal at @xmath35 on the positive side , in agreement with the nernst effect experiments wang1,lee2,wang2 in the cuprates .",
    "the signal weakens on either side of @xmath35 because the magnitude of the ddw order parameter weakens with @xmath32 on either side of this value of doping .",
    "in conclusion , we show that the nernst signal from an ambipolar ddw state has a robust low temperature peak which occurs below its mean field transition temperature . the onset of the nernst signal , however , occurs at the transition temperature itself , which may account for the sizable nernst effect found in the experiments in the pseudogap phase of the high temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "the sign of the peak value of the nernst coefficient can be positive or negative depending on whether electron- or hole - pockets , respectively , dominate the low temperature thermoelectric transport .",
    "for the experimental situation in some cuprates , where the low temperature hall coefficient is found to be negative indicating the dominance of the electron pocket in transport , we find that the peak in the temperature dependent nernst coefficient is on the positive side .",
    "in contrast , there is no such peak when the ddw state is non - ambipolar . in this case , with only one type of pockets in the excitation spectrum , the nernst signal is negative for both electron and hole pockets . however , quite surprisingly , we find that these two individual negative contributions ` add up ' to produce a net positive nernst effect in the ambipolar ddw state .",
    "we prove these results both by numerical calculations as well as analytical arguments , which establishes the robustness of the existence of the low temperature peak , making it insensitive to any reasonable variations of the microscopic parameters",
    ".    with a reasonable assumption about the doping dependence of the ddw order parameter , which is physically motivated and stipulates weakening of the order parameter with hole doping on either side of the underdoped regime , we find that the low temperature nernst coefficient also has a pronounced peak as a function of hole concentration .",
    "the peak of the nernst coefficient coincides with the value of doping where the ddw order parameter is assumed to be the strongest , and the signal weakens on either side of this value of the hole concentration . at low value of the hole doping",
    ", we find that the nernst coefficient remains negative over a wider range of temperature than at moderate underdoping , @xmath35 .",
    "to derive these results , we model the pseudogap phase by a doping - dependent ddw order parameter and assume transport scattering times which are constant throughout the fermi surface and also independent of energy in a small ( @xmath6-dependent ) energy interval around the fermi energy . even though our chosen ambipolar ddw state ( with its specific fermi surface topology ( fig .",
    "( fig : pockets ) ) is not the only possible state consistent with either the recent quantum oscillation experiments  doiron - leyraud:2007,leboeuf:2007,bangura:2008,jaudet:2008,yelland:2008,sebastian:2008 or the observed negative hall coefficient @xcite in the underdoped cuprates , it is at least one possible state qualitatively consistent with both . as such , the calculations for the nernst coefficient in the ambipolar ddw state given in this paper present at least one possible scenario for the observed enhanced nernst signals in the underdoped cuprate superconductors .",
