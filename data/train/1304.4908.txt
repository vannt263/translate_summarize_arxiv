    "it is common to study dynamics of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom in almost every scientific field . in general",
    "it is impractical , and often unnecessary , to track all the dynamic information of the whole system . furthermore even if the dynamic information of the whole system is available , a set of equations of motion or representations at reduced dimension are often desirable to reveal the system dynamics more transparently and informatively , or to allow efficient description of long time dynamics .",
    "consider , for example , a protein may have tens of thousands of atoms interacting with an even larger number of solvent molecules and other molecules .",
    "however , to provide insights of the protein functional mechanism it is often needed to monitor a few number of collective modes .    in statistical physics , the celebrated zwanzig - mori projection approach is a general and formal procedure to derive the equations of motion of a set of selected primary degrees of freedom , while the remaining secondary degrees of freedom manifest their effects on the primary degrees implicitly .",
    "this basic idea can be dated back to einstein on his treatment on brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "inspired by techniques from quantum mechanics , zwanzig provided a formal procedure leading to a set of governing equations in the form of generalized langevin equations ( gles )  @xcite . in the limit that there is clear time scale separation between the primary and secondary degrees of freedom , the gles can reduce into langevin equations .",
    "mori further derived a simplified version of the equations that is `` inherently linear in the system variables ''  @xcite . the z - m procedure is typically adopted to studies on closed hamiltonian systems that relax to thermodynamic equilibrium in the long time limit .",
    "one notable recent development is the work of lange and grubmuller to derive the dynamic equations of some collective coordinates with the zwanzig projection procedure  @xcite .",
    "the success of the zwanzig - mori projection approach leads to great interest to apply it to general non - hamiltonian systems out of thermal dynamic equilibrium , which may be dynamically highly inhomogeneous , and have fascinating emerging properties such as oscillations and bifurcations .",
    "examples include climate changes in one place , stock market fluctuations , and collective dynamics of @xmath0 neurons in a brain , stochastic dynamics of gene regulatory networks .",
    "it is of both theoretical and practical significances to examine the applicability of the projection formalism to complex systems , if yes , what new features of the gles exist .",
    "chorin and coworkers have made considerable efforts in this field  @xcite . using a time series analysis approach@xcite , erban et al .",
    "showed how one can reconstruct a one - dimensional fokker - planck equation , or the equivalent langevin equation , to recapitulate the dynamics of a gene regulatory network such as a toggle switch .",
    "kawai and komatsuzaki derived the gles in nonstationary environments  @xcite .",
    "recently xing and kim applied the projection approach to nonequilbrium non - hamiltonian systems with stochastic dynamics and derived the corresponding gles . in this paper we will further present a numerical procedure on how to reconstruct gles in a reduced representation from full model simulations .",
    "a prominent feature of the procedure is that all the model parameters are extracted directly from the data , in the same spirit of erban _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we summarize the theory of the zwanzig - mori projection and its generalization to non - hamiltonian systems ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] we present the numerical approach to extract the gle model parameters ; sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] shows numerical tests on two model systems ; and we conclude with discussions in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussions ] .",
    "first we give a heuristic presentation on the projection approach , following the discussions given in  @xcite with some modifications , and focusing on the hamiltonian systems .",
    "consider a system described by the hamiltonian , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are position and conjugate momentum vectors .",
    "we will use mass - weighted coordinates here .    the liouville operator @xmath4 is defined as , @xmath5 for an arbitrary dynamic variable @xmath6 , the projection operator is defined as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 composes the basis set for the projected subspace .",
    "the inner product for two arbitrary variables @xmath6 and @xmath9 is defined as , @xmath10 where @xmath11 means taking transpose and complex conjugate .",
    "any dynamic variable within the subspace can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis functions .",
    "the projected equations of an arbitrary dynamic variable @xmath6 , which is defined within the projected subspace , are given by , @xmath12 where @xmath13 the last equation leads to the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation , and we have used the anti - hermitian property of the liouville operator .    in practice",
    "the basis sets are usually chosen as portion of the coordinate vector @xmath2 and the corresponding conjugate momentum vector @xmath3 .",
    "mori derived a gle that is linear to the coordinates and momentum  @xcite .",
    "however , in principle this restriction is unnecessary .",
    "one can expand the hilbert space to include high order combinations of the coordinates and momentum .",
    "appendix [ appendixanalytic ] gives such an analytic example .",
    "therefore it should be clear that while the projection is performed in the linear hilbert space , the resultant gles can be nonlinear to the coordinate variable .",
    "especially below let s consider the extreme limit of including all the possible hilbert functions composed by the coordinate and velocity ( or momentum ) in reduced dimension .",
    "the following procedure is analogous to what adopted by zwanzig  @xcite .    for simplicity",
    "let s focus on projecting onto a one - dimensional manifold @xmath14 and its conjugate momentum , while generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward .",
    "noticing that a possible choice of the basis set of the hilbert space is @xmath15 , one can expand @xmath14 and @xmath16 as @xmath17 therefore @xmath14 and @xmath18 are vectors in the full hilbert space .",
    "let s consider the sub - hilbert space , which may still have infinite dimension , supported by all the possible multiplicative combinations of @xmath14 and @xmath18 , such as @xmath19 .",
    "a key observation is that these basis functions , denoted @xmath20 , compose a complete basis set for the subspace so any arbitrary function of @xmath21 , can be fully expressed by the basis set .",
    "that is , for an arbitrary function @xmath22 , the inner product becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 the above expression may be more familiar if the dirac bra and ket notations are used .",
    "then one obtains explicit expressions for the first term on the right hand side of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gle_formal ] , @xmath25 to derive the above expression , we perform integration by parts , and use the relations , @xmath26 compared to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : collective_cdot ] , the result derived by lange and grubmuller has an extra term @xmath27 in the expression of @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy may come from the fact that the projection operator defined in  @xcite does not rigorously satisfy @xmath29 .",
    "it remains to be examined on how this extra term may affect the dynamics . in the case",
    "@xmath30 is a linear combination of @xmath2 , and is chosen to satisfy @xmath31 , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : collective_cdot ] gives the familiar relation to the gradient of potential of mean force .",
    "recently xing and kim@xcite applied the zwanzig - mori projection procedure to a general dynamic system described by a set of stochastic differential equations , @xmath32 in general the vector @xmath33 can not be represented as the gradient of a scalar potential due to violation of detailed balance , @xmath34 and @xmath35 may be different , @xmath36 are temporally uncorrelated , statistically independent gaussian white noise with the averages satisfying @xmath37 , @xmath38 is related to the @xmath39 diffusion matrix @xmath40 , where the transpose of a matrix is designated by the superscript @xmath41 .",
    "the resultant gles for projection to @xmath42 , components of @xmath2 , assume the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the potential of mean force , @xmath45 is in general not symmetric , reflecting violation of detailed balance , and the generalized fluctuation - dissipation theorem reads , @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "for simplicity in the remaining discussions we focus on the case that the projected system is one - dimensional , while generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward .",
    "in this work , we assume that the full dynamics of the system under study , or the time series data of the primary degrees of freedom are available , and our goal is to reconstruct the dynamic equation in the reduced dimension from the data .    consider a generic 1-d generalized langevin equation , @xmath48+\\mathcal{f}(t ) \\label{eq : glealt}\\ ] ] we first integrate it from time @xmath49 to @xmath50 for discrete time steps @xmath51 , and perform ensemble average over the random force .",
    "notice that the random force @xmath52 averages out to 0 , then eqn.[eq : glealt ] becomes , @xmath53 \\label{eq : gleavg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can further be approximated as , @xmath54    alternatively , by multiplying @xmath55 on both sides of eqn .",
    "[ eq : glealt ] before performing average and integration , one obtains an equation for the autocorrelation function counterpart of eqn .",
    "[ eq : memk ] ,    @xmath56     \\nonumber\\\\ & &                  + \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\\gamma_1(t_{j+1/2 } )   \\left [   \\langle x(t_0)x(t_{i - j+1})\\rangle - \\langle x(t_0 ) x(t_{i - j})\\rangle \\right ] \\bigg\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the potential of mean force @xmath44 can be obtained directly from the stationary distribution @xmath57 from @xmath58 , and all the ensemble averaged terms ( @xmath59 ) can be obtained from the data .      both eqns .",
    "[ eq : memk ] and  [ eq : memcorr ] are linear equations of the terms @xmath45 and @xmath60 .",
    "for example , eqn.[eq : memk ] can be rewritten in matrix form as , @xmath61 here @xmath62 , elements of the square matrix @xmath63 for @xmath64 and 0 otherwise and @xmath65 .",
    "however , it is not numerically desirable to solve any of them directly , since numerical errors in @xmath66 and @xmath67 accumulate quickly and lead to inaccurate and unstable prediction of the gle parameters",
    ". instead we regularize the data using the tikhonov regularization ( also know as ridge regularization )  @xcite .",
    "simply speaking , the tikhonov regularization adds a penalty term to damp the highly oscillating components of the estimator .",
    "mathematically , we need to minimize the function ; @xmath68 in this work we choose @xmath69 , for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and 0 otherwise , except for the first and the last row where all elements are 0 .",
    "the term @xmath73 is a preselected constant , which we will refer as the penalization factor .",
    "this minimization yields a simple solution of the form , @xmath74 we assume that @xmath75 is a smooth function of @xmath76 , and thus the penalty function @xmath77 is chosen to minimize the derivatives , or differences between @xmath75 at two consecutive time points .",
    "however , use of the function @xmath77 may also lose meaningful information and distort the result .",
    "hence the penalty factor , @xmath73 , must be chosen wisely .",
    "below we demonstrate how to choose @xmath73 properly using two examples .",
    "using eqn .",
    "[ eq : glealt ] and with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath60 determined , we simulate the gle using the following discretized version , @xmath78 we use the method of berkowitz et al.@xcite to generate the random forces , with each realization given by @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are random numbers drawn from independent random gaussian distributions , @xmath82 and @xmath4 is the number of time steps over which the pseudo - random forces repeat",
    ". therefore @xmath83 should be no less than the simulation time .",
    "the spectral density @xmath84 is determined using the memory kernel through the wiener ",
    "khintchine@xcite theorem , @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "calculation of the spectral density may need @xmath60 at time points finer that those retrieved in section [ subset : tr ] , e.g. , within @xmath87 and @xmath49 , which are obtained through linear interpolation using @xmath88 and @xmath89 in this work .",
    "to demonstrate the strength of our parameter free projection method , we first apply it to a simple nonlinear chemical network .",
    "this network is an end product inhibition motif found in metabolic and other biology networks .",
    "the reactions are governed by irreversible michaelis  menten kinetics , @xmath90 and @xmath91 values @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 are used in the simulations .",
    "the system initially relaxes to the steady - state .",
    "we choose @xmath95 as our species of interest .",
    "we determine the potential of the mean force defined as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the stationary state distribution of @xmath95 . at time 0 , the concentration of @xmath98 is jumped to @xmath99 .",
    "the relaxation dynamics @xmath100 , which is defined as the value of @xmath95 averaged over all trajectories , is recorded for every time step with an interval of @xmath101 . in order to compute the memory kernel ( @xmath45 , @xmath60 )",
    "we first obtain the mean force through histogram counting and fit the entire @xmath102 with @xmath103 piecewise quadratic functions to facilitate the derivative calculations .",
    "next while recording the @xmath100 we also record the @xmath104 for every time step determined using the functional form determined using the piecewise quadratic fits .",
    "actually this model system has been studied in our earlier work  @xcite , where the memory kernel is obtained by fitting with an ansatz of the function form .",
    "here it is calculated directly using eqn .",
    "[ eq : tikho3 ] .",

    "both agree well with the previous results  @xcite , but differ in subtle details .",
    "as shown in fig  [ fig : jcpex]c , this subtle difference leads to remarkable improvement on the agreement between the gle result and the full model calculation , compared to the previous work .",
    "notice that both @xmath60 and @xmath107 show damped oscillations with similar frequency .",
    "furthermore , with the same memory kernel as shown in fig  [ fig : jcpex ] , we predict the relaxation dynamics with different values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 . again",

    "in general it is a question to what extent the gle parameters are transferable from one situation to another one .",

    "next we examine a more challenging system shown in fig [ fig : bist]a .",
    "it is a phenomenological model proposed by tyson et .",
    "al . to capture the crosstalk between the growth factor ( gf ) and esptrogen receptor ( er ) signaling in cancer studies  @xcite .",

    "erp facilitates / stabilizes gfr activation .",
    "further details of this model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this system is that it can have bistable dynamics .",
    "appendix  [ appendixergfr ] gives the detailed scheme for the full model and the gle simulations .",
    "we use chemical langevin equations to simulate the stochastic dynamics .",
    "table  [ tab : t1 ] in appendix [ appendixergfr ] gives the model parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : bist]b shows that this bistable system has a double - well shaped potential of mean force , with the more stable ( left ) state corresponding to the low gfr activity state . to generate the data for reconstructing the gle , we initialize the system within the right well corresponding to the high gfr activity state . fig .",
    "[ fig : bist]c gives the obtained memory kernel @xmath60 .",

    "however , the blue curve in fig .  [ fig : bist]d shows that the gle result does not agree well with the full model simulation results except at an early stage and the long time behavior . for the latter it is because the long time steady state behavior is governed by the potential of mean force . for the former the early stage dynamics is governed by @xmath45 .",
    "the discrepancy in the middle stage suggests that @xmath75 is not sufficiently long .",
    "physically , we think that the relaxation process involves the fast intrawell dynamics and the slow inter - well dynamics . in this case",
    "the inter - well transition dynamics is beyond a simple markovian process , but shows correlation among transitions .",
    "correspondingly , the memory kernel @xmath75 shows a rather long tail ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bist]c ) , and a biphasic relaxation dynamics for @xmath113 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bist]d ) . indeed using the evaluated @xmath60 up to @xmath114 mins",
    ", we obtain an excellent agreement between the gle ( red curve in fig .",

    "[ fig : fpt ] shows excellent agreement between the gle and full model results .",
    "it is a highly nontrivial achievement to reproduce the whole distribution , not just a few moments , such as the mean first passage time .",
    "reconstruction of the governing equations is an important step towards understanding a dynamical system .",
    "the zwanzig - mori projection method provides a rigorous theoretical formalism . in this work",
    ", we present a numerical procedure to reconstruct the gles from the data .",
    "numerical tests on two model systems show that the accuracy of the algorithm is encouraging .",
    "[ eqn : gle_formal ] is a mathematically exact solution .",
    "it is equivalent to but mathematically more involved than the original dynamic equations .",
    "the practical usage of the projection approach lies in the assumption that the effect of the implicitly treated secondary degrees of freedom can be well replaced by the potential of mean force , the memory kernel with some simple function forms , and the related noises with certain statistical properties .",
    "therefore one expects that the gles after such approximation in the form of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gle_phe ] work best for systems coupled to many degrees of freedom .",
    "einstein shows a classical example that a single drag coefficient and a corresponding white noise term can well describe the dynamics of a brownian particle influenced by its interaction with avogadro number of solvent molecules .",
    "then it is out of surprise that for both of the two models , which have only a small number of degrees of freedom , the gle results and the full model simulations agree remarkably well",
    ". it may be partly due to the fact that the full system dynamics is governed by stochastic differential equations , and the stochastic noise can be viewed as generated by a bath system with infinite number of degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "it remains to examine to what extent one can use a coordinate - independent memory kernel form to describe a dynamic system .",
    "most molecular systems are well modeled by some simple memory kernel forms such as an exponentially decayed function .",
    "recent single molecule studies reveal a power - law form for describing intramolecular fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "studies on the two model systems in this work show that the function form can be more complex for systems kept out of equilibrium .",
    "can one find a set of common function forms corresponding to systems with different dynamic behaviors ?",
    "let s ask the problem in an alternative way . in two or higher dimensions , the gles in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gle_phe ] share similar form as those obtained for hamiltonian systems relaxing to equilibrium , except that the matrix @xmath45 is not symmetric .",
    "for a one - dimensional gle , however , the form is the same .",
    "then can one tell whether it describes a closed or open system from the equation itself ?    in this work we perform numerical simulations with the stochastic gles to demonstrate their accuracy .",
    "simulating gles with colored noise is computationally expensive , especially if the noise spectrum has a long tail . in practical applications , in general",
    "there is no need to perform such full stochastic simulations .",
    "instead one may just need to calculate the first few moments of the distribution , or work with the corresponding fokker - planck equation .",
    "our numerical studies also reveal that the quality of a reconstructed gle is very sensitive to the accuracy of the potential of mean force , which then requires well converged sampling .",
    "some systematic studies and statistical tools are needed to improve the accuracy of reconstruction with less sufficient data . in our current algorithm",
    ", we first obtain the potential of mean force , and then the memory kernel that is affected by the form of the former",
    ". it may be desirable to have a procedure to reconstruct the two simultaneously .",
    "model 2 examined in this work shows a very long memory kernel , which includes both intra- and inter - well dynamics .",
    "one possible reason is that @xmath115 is not a good choice for the reaction coordinate , and the dynamics along the orthogonal degrees of freedom is comparable or even slower than that along @xmath115 .",
    "lange and grubmuller demonstrated how to reconstruct a gle along a nonlinear collective coordinate  @xcite .",
    "one may follow similar procedure to examine whether a short memory kernel can be obtained , and whether the dynamics between the two states can be approximated as markovian processes .    in this work we focus on model reduction .",
    "since the data needed for reconstruction is in the form of time series , the procedure can be used as a way of nonlinear time series analysis  @xcite .",
    "the latter is an active and under - developed area , with a main difficulty lying in how to construct the nonlinear function form . in the gle formalism , however , the nonlinearity is given by the potential of mean force that is automatically obtained from data .",
    "therefore in principle the difficulty of selecting the nonlinear function form does not exist .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we demonstrate the practical feasibility and accuracy of using the gles to model the dynamics of a general dynamic system , _",
    "i.e. _ , with or without detailed balance constraint , in reduced dimension .",
