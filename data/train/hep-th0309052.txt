    "in quantum field theory , one usually starts from fields and a lagrangean which describes the interaction .",
    "these objects get quantized and s - matrix elements or greens functions are then constructed by the help of feynman rules .",
    "however , these feynman rules lead to products of distributions with singular behavior .",
    "this leads to the well - known ultraviolet - divergences in perturbation theory .",
    "the occurrence of such divergences has led to the invention of several ingenious formal procedures like pauli - villars regularization @xcite or dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "the situation remained not entirely satisfactory for several decades .",
    "so feynman in his nobel lecture remarked : `` i think that the renormalization theory is simply a way to sweep the difficulties of the divergences of quantum electrodynamics under the rug . ''    today , the situation is not so bad as feynman described it .",
    "the regularization procedures which remove infinities from the theory are well understood and it has become clear that uv divergences do not imply an inconsistency of the theory in general , but are a consequence of our current perturbative formulation of quantum field theories .",
    "renormalization - group methods also shed a new light on their interpretation .",
    "it is still widely unknown that it is possible to treat feynman diagrams in such a manner that ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences do not appear in the calculations .",
    "this can be achieved by making explicit use of the causal structure of quantum field theory , i.e. by using dispersive techniques .",
    "contrary to widespread belief , the use of dispersion relations in practical calculations is not unusual and has been employed by various authors in phenomenologically important evaluations of calculationally demanding quantum electrodynamic corrections such as higher - order binding corrections to the two - loop bound - state quantum electrodynamic self - energy .",
    "have used dispersive techniques as early as in 1966 for a leading - order calculation of the lamb shift @xcite .",
    "pachucki has employed these relations for the evaluation of higher - order binding corrections to the two - loop lamb shift @xcite , and mentioned in his paper that the ultraviolet divergences canceled automatically in the calculations .    a very natural and rigorous approach to axiomatic perturbation theory which has been applied successfully to all relevant interactions of the standard model @xcite and supersymmetric models @xcite",
    "was provided by a classic paper of h. epstein and v. glaser in 1971 @xcite .",
    "their method , called finite causal perturbation theory or fcpt for short in this paper , avoids uv divergences from the start by defining mathematically correct time - ordered products for distributions .",
    "the resulting distributions are smeared out by test functions , avoiding provisionally volume and infrared divergences at once .",
    "an extensive introduction to the causal method can be found in the textbook of g. scharf on finite quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "there is now also a growing interest in fcpt , because it allows to formulate a consistent renormalization theory on a curved physical background @xcite .",
    "basically , fcpt provides a clearly defined strategy for the dispersive calculation of feynman diagrams .",
    "it renders all diagrams finite , but does not automatically solve problems related to the specification of normalization conditions and possible anomalies arising in the regularization procedure , which may violate symmetries which are necessary to give physical meaning .",
    "these problems like e.g. the formulation of ward identities or the introduction of interacting fields in the framework of fcpt have been trated extensively in recent years @xcite .    in fcpt ,",
    "the ansatz for the @xmath0-matrix as a power series in the coupling constant is crucial , namely @xmath0 is considered as a sum of smeared operator - valued distributions @xmath1 where the schwartz test function @xmath2 switches the interaction and provides the infrared cutoff . the basic formulation of causality in fcpt , which had already been used by bogoliubov _",
    "@xcite , is @xmath3 if the support of @xmath4 is later than @xmath5 in some lorentz frame ( usually denoted by @xmath6 ) .",
    "the condition allows the construction of the @xmath7-point distributions @xmath8 as a well - defined ` renormalized ' time - ordered product expressed in terms of wick monomials of free fields @xmath9 : @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are c - number distributions .",
    "@xmath12 is constructed inductively from the first order @xmath13 , which describes the interaction among the quantum fields , and from the lower orders @xmath14 , @xmath15 by means of poincar covariance and causality .",
    "the inductive construction of the n - point distributions @xmath8 can be considered as the main technical difference of the theory to other approaches , since all lower orders @xmath16 must be calculated first in order to construct @xmath8 .",
    "but the commonly chosen form of the @xmath8 @xmath17 @xmath18 where the sum runs over all @xmath19 permutations , is not an unambiguous definition , since it contains the product of heaviside distributions with other singular distributions .",
    "this leads to the well - known uv divergences in the calculation of feynman diagrams .",
    "one can illustrate this fact by the following simple one - dimensional example .",
    "the product of a heaviside distribution @xmath20 with a @xmath21-distribution @xmath22 or even its derivative @xmath23 is obviously not well - defined .",
    "the fourier transforms of the distributions are @xmath24 the ill - defined product @xmath25 goes over into a non - existing convolution by fourier transform @xmath26 which is definitely uv divergent.    it is the aim of this paper to demonstrate how uv finite results are obtained in the framework of fcpt by avoiding problematic feynman integrals .",
    "this is done in section 2 , where technical details are explained . in section 3",
    "the method is applied to the well - known introductory case of a scalar selfenergy diagram , and in section 4 , we apply the method to the less trivial case of the two - loop sunrise diagram with arbitrary masses .",
    "we start our considerations with a scalar neutral massive field @xmath27 with mass @xmath28 which satisfies the free klein - gordon equation .",
    "it can be decomposed into a negative and positive frequency part according to @xmath29 @xmath30 , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 .",

    "the imaginary part of the feynman propagator is given by @xmath58 and can be deduced directly from the causal jordan - pauli distribution @xmath59 in an obvious way .",
    "as a first step , we define the causal distribution @xmath60 in conformity with ( [ commutator ] ) as the following vacuum expectation value of a massive and a massless field ( the colons denote normal ordering ) @xmath61 | 0 \\rangle\\ ] ] which has again causal support due to microcausality .",
    "it is sufficient to consider @xmath62 @xmath63 since @xmath64 .",
    "the product of the two jordan - pauli distributions in real space goes over into a convolution in momentum space @xmath65 such that @xmath66 .",
    "since we do _ not _ calculate the _ time - ordered _ product of fields , the feynman propagators are replaced by jordan - pauli distributions .    the integral appearing in ( [ conv2 ] ) is readily evaluated if one exploits the @xmath21-distribution stemming from the massless field contraction in @xmath67 @xmath68 vanishes outside the closed backward lightcone due to lorentz invariance and the two @xmath69-distributions in eq .",
    "( [ self1 ] ) . therefore we can go to a lorentz frame where @xmath70 , and using the abbreviation @xmath71 leads to @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 and for arbitrary @xmath45 we get the intermediate result @xmath75 naive use of the dispersion relation ( [ disprel ] ) for the real part of the sunrise diagram would lead to an ultraviolet divergent expression . but it can be shown @xcite that the finite part of the diagram is given for @xmath50 by a subtracted dispersion relation ( which is also called _ splitting formula _ ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the power counting degree of the diagram , which is in our case @xmath78 since the diagram is logarithmically divergent .",
    "@xmath79 is normalized such that all derivatives of order @xmath80 of @xmath81 vanish at @xmath82 , i.e. in the present case @xmath83 these statements are only meaningful if the derivatives of order @xmath80 of @xmath79 exist in the sense of ordinary functions .",
    "this is assured in most cases by the existence of a massive field in the theory .",
    "we mention here that eq .",

    ", the additional term in the denominator of ( [ suptrel ] ) has a simple explanation . writing ( [ suptrel ] ) for @xmath47 as @xmath84 it becomes obvious that the division by @xmath85 acts as a kind of inverse differentiation on the causal distribution @xmath86 in real space .",
    "the transformed distribution has a less critical scaling behavior , and can be multiplied in a well - defined way by the time - ordering @xmath69-distribution .",
    "after the splitting , the original part of @xmath86 in the forward lightcone is recovered by differentiating @xmath87 times along the time axis , corresponding to a multiplication of the distribution by @xmath88 in momentum space .",
    "this observation also shows the connection of the method to differential renormalization @xcite .",
    "for further mathematical details we refer also to @xcite .",
    "the splitting integral can be evaluated by elementary methods @xmath89 and leads directly to @xmath90.\\ ] ] distribution theory leaves the freedom to add a constant to the result , which corresponds to a local term @xmath91 in real space .",
    "such local terms have to be restricted by further symmetry considerations in practical cases .",
    "we arrived thus on a very direct way to a finite expression for the scalar one - loop selfenergy diagram , which corresponds up to a prefactor to the regularized expression of the feynman integral @xmath92    we finally mention that one - loop diagrams in two space - time dimensions are treated in the framework of fcpt in @xcite , whereas three - dimensional qed is treated in @xcite .",
    "in the following section , we will utilize the strategy discussed above for the calculation of the imaginary part of the sunrise diagram .",
    "this will show that the causal treatment of feynman diagrams is also applicable to non - trivial cases .",
    "an extensive introduction to the calculation of two - loop diagrams in the causal method has been given in @xcite , but the case of the sunrise diagram is missing there . due to the fundamental structure of the sunrise diagram , it is clear that it has been investigated by the use of many different approaches , and in this paper it serves only as a convenient example for a dispersive calculation .",
    "we give therefore a short overview over the literature which is related to the subject in the following .",
    "there is now an increased interest in precise calculations of multi - loop feynman diagrams . in the general massive case ,",
    "relevant for future high precision calculations in the electroweak theory which go beyond the currently available one - loop electroweak radiative corrections @xcite , the number of parameters makes it impossible to obtain results in the usual analytic form already in the case of the two - loop sunrise selfenergy diagram shown in fig.1 .",
    "when one or two internal particles are massless , the four - dimensional results can be obtained in terms of dilogarithms @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated when all the virtual particles in the diagram have ( different ) masses .",
    "such a situation occurs e.g. in the two - loop off - shell contributions to the higgs selfenergy . in three dimensions ,",
    "the expression for the sunrise diagram is quite compact even for different masses @xcite , but in the four dimensions , there are arguments @xcite that the result can not be expressed in terms of polylogarithms or other well - known special functions .",
    "there is nowadays also a widely accepted procedure of expressing radiative correction calculations in terms of a limited number of master integrals ( mi ) @xcite , which reduces the problem of finding analytic expressions for two - loop diagrams to the careful determination of the mi .",
    "the method has also the advantage that , with a correct bookkeeping of the recurrence relations arising from integration by parts identities , the mi of a given problem can be reused in more complicated calculations .",
    "as already mentioned , the analytical calculation of mi ( in terms of the usual polylogarithms and their generalizations ) is possible only in cases with high symmetry , i.e. when the number of different scales ( internal masses and external momenta or mandelstam variables ) is small like in qcd calculations , where all masses are set to zero , or in qed - type cases , where only the electron mass is different from zero , or when the external variables are fixed to particular values ( zero or mass shell condition ) .",
    "another possibility of help in analytic calculations is sometimes offered by the exploitation of particular simplifying conditions , like the smallness of some ratios of the parameters allowing the corresponding expansion .",
    "the mi of the sunrise diagram were recognized to be expressible in closed form as a combination of four lauricella functions , a special class of generalized hypergeometric series @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the method provides efficient multiple series expansions for the regions of small @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 , and of large @xmath95 , but some problems arise in the intermediate region .",
    "there were also efforts devoted to the investigation of properties in special points ( i.e. at @xmath96 , pseudothresholds and threshold ) .",
    "the analytical expansions of the mi at @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given in @xcite and @xcite ; the values at pseudothresholds and threshold in @xcite ; the analytical expansions at pseudothresholds can be found in @xcite ; a semi - analytical expansion at threshold in @xcite and also in configuration space technique in @xcite , while the complete analytical expansions at threshold are presented in @xcite .    for numerical evaluation purposes , it is possible to cast the general massive selfenergy diagram in a double integral representation and in the particular case of the sunrise diagram in a single integral representation @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the configuration space technique is also exploited in the numerical approach @xcite , @xcite . in a recent approach rearrangements of the integrand , driven by the bernstein - tkachov theorem ,",
    "are introduced to improve numerical convergence @xcite .",
    "a different and interesting method is the use of the recurrence relations as difference equations to numerically evaluate the mi @xcite .",
    "it is of general interest to provide the widest possible range of insight into the structure and analytic properties of multi - loop diagrams . in the present paper",
    "we exploit the causal structure of the sunrise diagram , which immediately leads to a straightforward evaluation of the imaginary part of the diagram by elliptic functions .",
    "the real part of the diagram can then be obtained from a single integral dispersion relation .",
    "the dispersive method works especially well for diagrams which depend only on one external momentum , although its has already been used for different kinds of cases .    as in the case of the one - loop selfenergy diagram",

    "( [ masslesst ] ) reflects also the high energy behavior of the massive propagator @xmath169 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath170 in the expressions above is due to the fact that we have included a prefactor @xmath171 in our definition of the feynman propagator .",
    "a closed analytic expression has been derived for the imaginary part of the scalar sunrise diagram with arbitrary masses of the virtual particles .",
    "the technical difference between the usual feynman diagram calculations and the method used in the present paper is that the occurring integrals are reduced step by step to single integrals by utilizing the @xmath21-distributions in the jordan - pauli distributions instead of performing a wick rotation .",
    "the real part of the sunrise diagram can be expressed for all values of the external impulse by a single integral , because the causal distribution @xmath172 which is related to the imaginary part of the diagram has the special form @xmath173 therefore the dispersion relation ( [ suptrel2 ] ) can also be written for @xmath50 @xmath174 @xmath175 + 1 } \\int \\limits_{m_{tot}^2}^{\\infty } ds \\ , \\frac{h(s ) } { s^{[\\omega/2]+1}(p^2-s+ip_0 0)},\\ ] ] where @xmath176 $ ] denotes the largest integer @xmath177 .",

    "the problem of overlapping divergences is automatically solved by the causal method due to the inductive construction of the theory , whereas in usual renormalization schemes it becomes a nontrivial problem to show that all sub - diagrams of a given diagram can be renormalized in a consistent way . in the context of the bphz method , the problem was solved by the forest formula , an algorithm which disentangles all divergences in subdiagrams @xcite .",
    "this is one of the conceptual strengths of the causal approach .",
    "furthermore it should be pointed out that on the level of the sunrise diagram discussed in this paper , the calculation of the imaginary part can as well be understood by the cutkoski rules .",
    "but at higher orders , one should clearly distinguish between these rules which rely mainly on the unitarity of the theory , whereas in the causal approach the main input is causality .",
    "we have used the example of the surise diagram in order to illustrate in a pedagogical manner the strategy and fundamental properties of the dispersive approach for the calculation of feynman diagrams .",
    "we refer also to the recent literature on the specific case of the sunrise diagram , where also non - trivial vertex structures are treated by dispersive and non - dispersive methods @xcite .",

    "<S> using dispersive techniques , it is possible to avoid ultraviolet divergences in the calculation of feynman diagrams , making subsequent regularization of divergent diagrams unnecessary . </S>",
    "<S> we give a simple introduction to the most important features of such dispersive techniques in the framework of the so - called finite causal perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the method is also applied to the divergent general massive two - loop sunrise selfenergy diagram , where it leads directly to an analytic expression for the imaginary part of the diagram in accordance with the literature , whereas the real part can be obtained by a single integral dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that dispersive methods have been known for decades and have been applied to several nontrivial feynman diagram calculations . </S>",
