    "recently shimizu @xcite ( see also ref . ) have reported resistivity and magnetization measurements on fe samples under pressure , and identified a superconducting phase characterized by the meissner effect and the vanishing of the resistivity above a pressure of 15 gpa . at this pressure the stable crystal sructure of fe",
    "is known to be hcp .",
    "both the hcp phase and superconductivity in fe under pressure are results that can be expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "stability of bcc , fcc and hcp crystal structures as a function of canonical @xmath4-band filling was discussed some time back by pettifor @xcite and andersen @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that without ferromagnetism the ground state of fe would be hcp , just as for its nonmagnetic and isoelectronic 4@xmath4 and 5@xmath4 counterparts , ru and os . for fe",
    "the bcc structure is stabilized only via ferromagnetism . in the ferromagnetic bcc state",
    "both the atomic volume and compressibility of fe are anomalously large@xcite .",
    "application of a moderate pressure results in bcc to hcp martensitic transformation and loss of ferromagnetism@xcite . both ru and os",
    "are superconducting at low temperatures .",
    "thus superconductivity in hcp fe is hardly surprising .",
    "what differentiates hcp fe from ru and os is the presence of spin fluctuations .",
    "both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are known to suppress superconductivity mediated via @xmath1-wave electron - phonon coupling .",
    "a notable example , where ferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( paramagnons ) are believed to suppress superconductivity completely , is fcc pd .",
    "a large density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , @xmath5 , in fcc pd causes a large stoner - enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility , leading to strong ferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "disorder - induced superconductivity in fcc pd , due mainly to the reduction in @xmath5 and therefore in spin fluctuations , has been claimed experimentally as well as discussed theoretically @xcite . a similar effect",
    "could conceivably be achieved in fcc pd under pressure , but is yet to be observed . the case for hcp fe",
    "is somewhat different , since it is believed to be close to antiferromagnetic@xcite or complex magnetic@xcite instability .",
    "it was noted by wohlfarth@xcite that at the lowest pressures ( @xmath610 gpa ) at which hcp fe is stable , it should be close to an antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "he also suggested that the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations might not be strong enough to suppress superconductivity in hcp fe , particularly at elevated pressures , where reduction in @xmath5 would cause spin fluctuations to eventually disappear .",
    "antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations suppress @xmath1-wave superconductivity , while contributing to @xmath7-wave superconductivity . at present experimental evidence regarding the type of superconductivity ( @xmath1-wave or otherwise ) in hcp fe",
    "is lacking .",
    "one can estimate the @xmath8 in hcp fe by using simple scaling arguments and the observed superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 of ru ( 0.5 k ) or os ( 0.7 k ) at normal pressure .",
    "let us ignore spin fluctuations and consider the mcmillan expression : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the debye temperature , @xmath11 is the coulomb pseudopotential , and @xmath12 is the electron - phonon coupling constant , given by @xmath13 .",
    "considering @xmath11 = 0.1 , we get @xmath14 for ru ( @xmath10 = 600 k , see ref . ) . to estimate @xmath12 for hcp fe",
    ", we assume that the mean square electron - phonon(ion ) matrix element @xmath15 and the effective spring constant @xmath16 are nearly the same as in hcp ru . the average phonon frequency , and thus @xmath10 ,",
    "should then scale as the inverse square root of the ratio of the atomic masses , and @xmath12 should scale according to the ratio of @xmath5 .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 can be easily calculated for elemental solids .",
    "however , we only need to estimate the ratio of this quantity between ru and fe .",
    "we can start by assuming that @xmath5 is proportional to the inverse @xmath4-band width , which can be estimated from the potential parameters of the lmto - asa ( atomic sphere approximation ) method @xcite .",
    "here the band width is proportinal to the potential parameter @xmath17 . both @xmath17 and its volume derivative",
    "have already been tabulated@xcite for a large number of elemental solids . from the @xmath4-orbital values of the parameter @xmath17 , @xmath18 = 539/280 = 1.925",
    "this would give @xmath12 = 0.62 for fe , resulting in a transition temperature of @xmath617 k for hcp fe .",
    "if we use published values of @xmath5 , for hcp fe@xcite ( corresponding to a pressure @xmath19 10 gpa ) and for ru@xcite ( corresponding to normal prssure ) , then @xmath20 = 20.8/11.8 = 1.76 , and @xmath12=0.56 for hcp fe .",
    "this ratio yields an improved value @xmath21 = 12 k. using the measured value of @xmath10 in hcp fe ( @xmath6 500 k at @xmath6 10 gpa , see ref . )",
    "gives a value@xcite and @xmath22@xcite are obtained via different methods : lapw@xcite and lmto@xcite .",
    "using the same method to calculate both doss would result in a ratio that is 10% smaller , giving @xmath12 = 0.5 for fe , and a @xmath23 5 k. ] of 7.6 k.    for a quick estimate of the pressure - dependence of @xmath8 we use a simplified version of eq.[mcm ] : @xmath24 and resort to the tabulated values of the logarithmic derivative of the potential parameter @xmath17 with respect to atomic sphere radius , @xmath1 ( ref . ) .",
    "neglecting the volume(pressure ) dependence of the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath11 in eq.[simpletc ] , we obtain , for the logarithmic derivative of @xmath8 with respect to the system volume @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the grneisen parameter .",
    "we have used the approximations : @xmath28 with the assumption @xmath29 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath4-orbital band width parameter in lmto - asa , @xmath30 . for the @xmath4-orbitals of",
    "fe @xmath31 = -4.6 . from the reported value@xcite of @xmath32 in hcp fe",
    ", we obtain a value @xmath33 for hcp fe .",
    "the zero pressure bulk modulus in hcp fe is 165 gpa @xcite .",
    "the initial ( low pressure ) logarithmic derivative of @xmath8 in hcp fe should thus be close to -6.6/165 ( gpa)@xmath34 = - 4% /gpa .",
    "exercises such as the one outlined above are useful in obtaining order of magnitude estimates and in understanding the trend from one element to the next . however , quantitative agreement with experimental results might be missing . according to the study by shimizu @xcite superconductivity in hcp fe appears at around 15 gpa , slightly above the pressure at which the bcc - hcp transition takes place .",
    "the transition temperature grows slowly from below 1 k to about 2 k at @xmath622 gpa and then decreases steadily , with superconductivity vanishing beyond 30 gpa@xcite .",
    "the rate of decrease of @xmath8 is too rapid compared with the estimate derived above . in order to reproduce the initial increase of @xmath8 with pressure ,",
    "as observed in the experiment , it would be necessary to include the spin fluctuation effects and possible volume dependence of the matrix element @xmath15 . with inceasing pressure ,",
    "spin fluctuations are expected to diminish , causing @xmath8 to rise .",
    "the electron phonon matrix element may also increase with pressure , as the nearest neighbor distances become shorter .",
    "it would thus be of interest to examine to what extent the observed results can be explained via a rigorous _ ab initio _ calculation . to this end",
    "we have used the full - potential linear muffin - tin orbitals linear response ( fp - lmto - lr ) scheme developed by savrasov @xcite to calculate the phonon frequencies and the electron - phonon coupling in hcp fe as a function of pressure .",
    "the eliashberg equations @xcite , in their isotropic fermi surface averaged form , are used to study the pressure - dependence of the transition temperature @xmath8 , and the superconducting gap @xmath17 .",
    "effects of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and the effects of scattering from magnetic impurities are explored to accommodate the experimental data as best as possible .",
    "we also present a simplified treatment of @xmath2-wave pairing in hcp fe .",
    "so far two other theoretical calculations , related to superconductivity in hcp fe and its pressure dependence , have appeared@xcite .",
    "our work differs from these publications @xcite in asmuch as it presents a more rigorous first - principles calculation of the phonons and the electron - phonon coupling as a function of the lattice parameter in hcp fe .",
    "there is considerable experimental evidence that at room temperature the martensitic transition from the bcc to the hcp phase in iron takes place at a pressure of 10 - 15 gpa @xcite .",
    "recently ekman @xcite have studied this phase transition using the full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) total energy method .",
    "their study indicates a first order ferromagnetic bcc to nonmagnetic hcp transition .",
    "these authors carried out spin - polarized density functional calculations using the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew and wang ( gga1 ) @xcite .",
    "steinle - neumann @xcite , using a later version of the gga by perdew , burke , and ernzerhofer ( gga2 ) @xcite , find an antiferromagnetic ground state for hcp fe and show that this version of the gga better reproduces the observed elastic properties of hcp fe under pressure .",
    "the possibility of noncollinear magnetism in hcp fe below 50 gpa has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "these results are at variance with the mssbauer study of hcp fe under pressure , which has failed to reveal any local magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "the possibility remains that hcp fe stays close to antiferromagnetic or complex magnetic instability . in this work",
    "we assume a nonmagnetic phase for hcp fe under pressure , and present results that were obtained by using gga1 @xcite .",
    "our calculations , using various forms of gga , show that the nature of the ground state at various lattice parameters depends very much on the exchange correlation potential and the @xmath35 ratio .",
    "in addition , the energy differences between nonmagnetic , ferromagnetic , and antiferromagnetic ( afm i and afm ii configurations@xcite ) states are often small ( almost within the errors of the method ) , as well as dependent on technical details , such as the number of * k*-points in the irreducible brillouin zone and method of bz integration ( see further discussion in section v ) .    according to ekman @xcite the bcc to hcp transition leads to a phase with a @xmath35 ratio of 1.57 .",
    "our lmto - asa calculations yield a smaller ( by @xmath6 0.8 mry ) hcp ground state energy for @xmath36 than for the ideal close packing value . in the fp - lmto calculations the difference in the ground state energies for the two @xmath35 values is smaller than 0.2 mry .",
    "previous theoretical studies for iron indicate a very small dependence of the total energy on the @xmath35 ratio@xcite and in addition , the @xmath35 ratio is likely to change with pressure .",
    "we have thus adopted the simplest option , as in ref . , and carried out all our calculations with the ideal close - packing case : @xmath37 .",
    "the electronic structure was calculated using savrasov s fp - lmto code @xcite with a triple-@xmath38 @xmath39 lmto basis for the valence bands . @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41-semicore states were treated as valence states in separate energy windows .",
    "the charge densities and potentials were represented by spherical harmonics with @xmath42 inside the nonoverlapping mt spheres and by plane waves with energies @xmath43 141 ry in the interstitial region .",
    "brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations were performed with the full - cell tetrahedron method @xcite using 793 * k*-points in the irreducible zone .",
    "band structures of hcp fe obtained via the fp - lmto method for all lattice parameters considered are in good agreement with the lmto - asa bands .",

    "the observation of a second raman peak besides that due the raman active @xmath176 mode in hcp fe has been assigned to disorder induced phonon scattering @xcite , although , based on density functional calculation , the possibility of antiferromagnetic order up to a pressure of approximately 60 gpa has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "normal state resistivity measurements by jaccard show a @xmath177 temperature dependence at low temperature , which is predicted by a nearly ferromagnetic fermi - liquid model .",
    "the earlier mssbauer study of hcp fe under pressure had failed to reveal any local magnetic moment @xcite , and results of theoretical calculations are dependent on the treatment of the exchange and correlation potentials used in the calculations . in view of this",
    ", we have adopted the same approach as mazin @xcite : we assume nonmagnetic state under pressure and examine the electron - phonon coupling as a function of the lattice parameter .    the results of our study can be summarized as follows : + ( i ) the hopfield parameter @xmath178 increases steadily with pressure , showing a wider variation for the linear response calculation than obtained via the rmt approximation ( both in our lmto - rmt calculation and in that of mazin @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) below volumes @xmath17950 a.u . per atom",
    "( above estimated pressures @xmath6 160 gpa ) phonons stiffen rapidly , bringing the @xmath8 down ( somewhat faster than what is suggested in ref . ) .",
    "( iii ) @xmath8 s based on the @xmath1-wave electron - phonon coupling , and maximum possible estimates of @xmath78 are higher than the experimental values ( iv ) the range of volume where superconductivity appears is much broader in the calculations than what is observed , in agreement with the result of ref . .",
    "( v ) inclusion of ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , and scattering from magnetic impurities can all bring the calculated values of @xmath8 down to the range of observed values , but can not substantially improve the agreement between the calculated and the experimental pressure / volume range of the superconducting phase ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "( vi ) a simplified treatment of @xmath2-wave pairing due to electron - phonon and spin fluctuation interactions yields a very small @xmath8 ( @xmath43 0.01 k ) , in contrast with the claim made in ref . .",
    "the role of impurities remains somewhat puzzling as well as of vital interest at present .",
    "the initial results of shimizu @xcite showed very high normal state residual resistivity ( @xmath180 cm ) , indicating the presence of substantial defects in the samples studied .",
    "more recent measurements @xcite with purer samples ( with residual resistivity 50 times smaller ) show the same maximum @xmath8 at the same pressure .",
    "if the impurities in the earlier studied samples were magnetic this would rule out electron - phonon @xmath1-wave coupling as the primary mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "however , jaccard @xcite also notice that superconductivity in their samples is unusually sensitive to disorder , developing only when the electronic mean free path exceeds a threshold value .",
    "they find the normal state resistivity to be characteristic of a nearly ferromagnetic metal , but our calculation of @xmath2-wave superconducting @xmath8 in the presence of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and electron - phonon interactions yields values less than @xmath181 k , similar to that for pd obtained by allen and mitrovi @xcite .",
    "our calculations seem to rule out both @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave superconductivity in hcp fe .",
    "electron - phonon mediated @xmath1-wave superconductivity should persist , in severe disagreement with experiment , beyond pressures of 200 gpa even in the presence of spin fluctuations .",
    "the possibility of @xmath4-wave superconductivity mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations remains to be explored .",
    "a @xmath4-wave superconductivity would be consistent with the observation @xcite that superconductivity in hcp fe seems to be extreemly sensitive to disorder .",
    "low temperature specific heat measurements can further clarify this issue .",
