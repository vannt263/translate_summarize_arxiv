    "understanding these interactions is crucial for the development of drug delivery systems that depend on efficient adhesion between a liposome and the plasma membrane of the target cell .",
    "adhesion between two membranes or between a membrane and another surface can , in principle , be facilitated by non - specific attractive interactions ( e.g. , coulomb and van der waals interactions ) @xcite .",

    "this entropy loss can be minimized if the two adhesion bonds are brought to the same place ( fig .",

    "the membrane fluctuations , thus , induce an attractive potential of mean force between the adhesion bonds .",
    "this effect is often named after casimir who predicted the existence of an attractive force between two conducting plates , due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the intervening space @xcite .",

    "just like adhesion bonds , membrane inclusions represent a `` constraint '' on the shape of the membrane and , therefore , one should expects that they also interact with each other through casimir - like interactions .",
    "in addition to the fluctuation - induced forces , the inclusions also experience other membrane - mediated interactions which arise from the membrane curvature elasticity and from the packing of the lipids near the inclusions surfaces ( see review in @xcite , and refs .  therein ) .",
    "these other types of membrane - mediated interactions are also expected to exist between membrane adhesion bonds .",
    "the fundamental difficulty in attempting to provide a statistical - mechanical analysis of the aggregation behavior of the adhesion bonds is the need to integrate out the membrane degrees of freedom and write down the potential of mean force as a function of the coordinates of the adhesion sites @xmath1 .",

    "what is the difference between the aggregation of adhesion bonds in supported membranes and the traditional process of gas to liquid condensation ?",
    "condensation phase transitions are usually associated with a competition between the mixing entropy @xmath4 which is higher in the dilute gas phase , and the interaction energy @xmath5 which is lower in the condensed liquid state .",
    "the equilibrium phase corresponds to the minimum of the free energy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the temperature of the system . at high @xmath7 ,",
    "the free energy @xmath8 is `` entropy - dominated '' and equilibrium is attained in the gas phase .",
    "conversely , at low @xmath7 , the free energy is `` energy - dominated '' and , therefore , the condensed phase becomes thermodynamically more favorable .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition can be analyzed in the framework of an ising - like model of identical particles that populate a lattice .",
    "excluded volume interactions between the particles are represented by the fact each lattice site can be occupied by no more than one particle .",
    "when two particles occupy nearest - neighbor sites , they interact in a pairwise fashion with an attractive energy @xmath9 . denoting the occupancy of a lattice site by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 for an empty site and @xmath12 for an occupied site , the hamiltonian of the lattice - gas model is given by @xmath13 where the sum runs over all the pairs of lattice nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the phase diagram of the lattice - gas model is well known .",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath14 such that if the interaction energy @xmath15 , the particles will be distributed uniformly within the lattice . above this critical value , @xmath16 ,",
    "a uniform distribution of the particles is observed only at low concentrations of particles ( `` gas phase '' ) , but upon increasing the concentration of particles , the system undergoes a first order phase transition and a second coexisting phase appears with a considerably larger concentration ( `` condensed phase '' ) .    as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the aggregation process of adhesion domains involves an additional attractive potential of mean force resulting from the membrane thermal fluctuations . a lattice model where each lattice particle represents an adhesion bond in a supported membrane",
    "can , therefore , be introduced by supplementing eq.([eq : latticegas ] ) with an energy term corresponding to the fluctuation - induced interactions .",
    "since the functional form of this many - body potential of is yet unknown , we would , at this moment , introduce it via a general potential function @xmath17 that depends on the coordinates of the lattice particles : @xmath18 our first task must be to derive an expression for @xmath19 .",
    "once this is accomplished , one can attempt to analyze the statistical mechanical properties of the model and address the question appearing at the beginning of section [ sec : lattice - gas ] .",
    "one particular issue that we would like to address is whether the fluctuation induced attractive potential ( which is of entropic origin ) can win the competition against the repulsive force originating from the mixing entropy ?",
    "in other words , can adhesion clusters form for purely entropic grounds , i.e. for @xmath20 in eq.([eq : latticegas2 ] ) ?",
    "gas to liquid condensation transitions are generally believed to involve energy vs.  entropy competition @xcite , but purely entropic phase transitions from a fluid ( disordered ) phase into a crystalline ( ordered ) phase are known to exist .",
    "hard sphere systems , for instance , undergo a first order phase transition from a low density fluid phase into a high density solid phase @xcite .",
    "this transition results from the competition between two entropies - the configurational mixing entropy which is higher in the disordered phase , and the entropy associated with the free volume available for each sphere , which is higher in the ordered crystal .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the system shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , consisting of a membrane with bending rigidity @xmath21 that fluctuates above a flat impenetrable surface @xcite .",

    "however , one can relate the partition function @xmath33 of hamiltonian ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) with the partition @xmath35 of the free membrane hamiltonian ( [ eq : helfrich2 ] ) , by using the following simple argument .",
    "the energy of a freely fluctuating membrane is invariant with respect to rigid - body transformations such as a vertical translation ( @xmath40 ) of the membrane s center of mass .",
    "therefore , one can draw a flat surface and translate the free membrane such that the global minimum of its height function coincides with the surface ( see fig .  [ fig:4](a ) ) .",
    "the vertically translated free membrane looks very similar to the pinned membrane shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) .",
    "the only difference between them is that the former can also glide over the surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) ) , while the latter is pinned at a fixed position on the surface .",
    "this suggests that the pinning point effectively eliminates the membrane horizontal translational degree of freedom . in a statistical mechanical language",
    ", the configurational phase space of the pinned membranes is smaller than , yet _",
    "similar _ to , the phase space of a free membrane .",
    "each subspace of identical free membrane configurations , like the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) , includes one pinned membrane configuration - the configuration where the minimum of @xmath36 is at the pinning point @xmath23 ( or , more precisely , within a microscopic area of size @xmath41 around the pinning point , where @xmath39 is the spatial resolution of the continuum model ) .",
    "this pinned membrane configuration occupies a fraction @xmath42 of the corresponding larger free membrane configurational subspace , which implies that the partition functions of the two systems are related by @xmath43 .",
    "the free energy is obtained from @xmath44 the first term on the right hand side is the free energy of the free membrane whose elastic energy is given by helfrich hamiltonian ( [ eq : helfrich ] ) .",
    "the second term , @xmath45 is the free energy cost of attaching the membrane to the surface at one point .    following the above argument leads to a very interesting conclusion .",
    "because of the similarity mapping that exists between the configurational phase spaces of the two problems , the statistical properties of the pinned and the free membrane must be identical to each other . this surprising result can be demonstrated by using an implicit - solvent coarse - grained ( iscg ) bilayer model which enables molecular simulations of mesoscopically large bilayer membranes over relatively large time - scales @xcite . towards this end",
    ", we ran two independent monte carlo ( mc ) simulations - one of a free membrane ( without a surface ) and one of a membrane supported by a flat impenetrable surface . a snapshot from the supported membrane simulations is shown in fig .  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "each lipid molecule is represented in the model by a short string of three spherical beads , where one of the beads ( depicted as a dark gray sphere in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) represents the hydrophilic head group and two beads ( light gray spheres in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) represent the hydrophobic tail of the lipid . in the supported membrane simulations ,",
    "the head bead of one of the lipids ( appearing in the corner at the front of the figure and indicated by an arrow ) was fixed to a flat surface which the lipids were not allowed to cross .",
    "we measured the fourier spectrum of the membrane height function .",
    "for the free membrane , the application of the equipartition theorem to the fourier - space representation of the helfrich hamiltonian ( [ eq : helfrich3 ] ) yields the following relationship between the mean squared amplitude of the fourier modes ( `` spectral intensity '' ) and the wave - vector @xmath46 : @xmath47 fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] depicts the results of our mc simulations for the spectral intensity vs.  the wavenumber @xmath48 .",
    "the figure show that , in agreement with our predictions : ( i ) the free ( open circles ) and pinned ( solid circles ) membranes exhibit the same statistics of thermal height fluctuations , and ( ii ) the spectral intensities of both membranes follow the @xmath49 power - law dependence anticipated by eq.([eq : eqpartition ] ) ( dashed line ) .",
    "one can reverse the argument and derive eq.([eq : attachmentfenergy ] ) starting from the assumption that the spectral intensity of the supported membrane is identical to that of a free membrane and , therefore , can be described by eq.([eq : eqpartition ] ) .",
    "the derivation proceeds as follows : first , from eq.([eq : eqpartition ] ) , one can straightforwardly show that the typical height at which the membrane undulates above the surface at a distance @xmath50 away from the pinning point scales linearly with @xmath50 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) : @xmath51 there is a repulsive force acting between the fluctuating membrane and the underlying surface , caused by their mutual steric hindrance .",
    "helfrich @xcite showed that the associated repulsive interaction free energy density ( per unit area ) has the following scaling behavior @xmath52 which , together with eq.([eq : linear ] ) , yields @xmath53 by integrating this energy density over the projected area of the membrane , one derives eq.([eq : attachmentfenergy ] ) up to a numerical prefactor @xmath54 to set @xmath55 , as in eq.([eq : attachmentfenergy ] ) , one needs to replace the scaling relation eq.([eq : fenergydensity ] ) with the equality @xmath56",

    "this is done by regarding the point of collision between the membrane and the surface as a second pinning point which can diffuse across the surface . in this context , the probability density @xmath59 $ ] is identified with the pair correlation function between the adhesion points which , therefore , also follows the scaling form @xmath60 by definition , the pair potential of mean force is given by @xmath61 = 2k_bt\\ln\\left(r\\right ) , \\label{eq : pairpotential}\\ ] ] which is an infinitely long range attractive potential that does not depend of the bending rigidity of the membrane , @xmath21 .    the validity of eq.([eq : pair1 ] ) can be tested by using mc simulations of the iscg model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] with two lipid heads attached to surface - one fixed at the origin and the other allowed to diffuse on the flat surface . the pair correlation function is then directly computed by sampling the position of the mobile adhesion point .",
    "our results @xcite , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , agree very well with eq.([eq : pair1 ] ) .",
    "the slope of the straight line on the log - log plot is equal to @xmath62 .",

    "the lipids becomes important and the radial pair distribution function is dominated by the depletion shells around the lipids .",
    "what if , in addition to the excluded volume repulsion , the membrane and the surface also interact via an attractive potential of somewhat longer range ? let us consider , for instance , the case when a harmonic confining potential is added to the helfrich hamiltonian : @xmath65d^2\\vec{r}. \\label{eq : helfrich4}\\ ] ] for the harmonically confined membrane , one can define the length scale @xmath66 which marks the transition between two scaling regimes . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations are governed by the bending rigidity term in hamiltonian ( [ eq : helfrich4 ] ) , while for @xmath68 the harmonic confinement term becomes dominant .",
    "the latter term is a local one , which implies that the influence of the adhesion point becomes screened at large distances . in the case of a single adhesion point ,",
    "the height of the fluctuations is now given by ( compare with eq.([eq : linear ] ) ) @xmath69 as illustrated schematically in fig .",

    "this scaling form is also confirmed by mc simulations ( see fig .  [ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "one of the main questions we aim to explore is whether the fluctuation - induced interactions are sufficiently strong to allow the formation of adhesion clusters . in the case of two adhesion",
    "points the answer is no . despite of the attractive force between the adhesion points , they remains unbound and their mean pair separation grows linearly with the system size @xmath76 . more generally , if the pair correlation function decays algebraically at large distance , @xmath77 , the mean pair separation is given by @xmath78 the physically relevant cases in eq.([eq : pair4 ] ) are @xmath79 which , respectively , correspond to pinned , pinned - stressed , and pinned - confined membranes . in all of these cases",
    ", @xmath80 grows with the size of the system .",
    "another quantity of interest is the mean number @xmath81 of contacts between the surface and a membrane with one adhesion point . as discussed in section [ sec : twopoints ] , the probability density that membrane comes into contact with the surface at a distance @xmath50 from the pinning point has the same scaling form as the pair correlation function @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 we can use this last result to generalize and recalculate the attachment free energy of one adhesion point , eq.([eq : attachmentfenergy ] ) .",
    "our original derivation of eq.([eq : attachmentfenergy ] ) was based on the argument that the configuration phase space of a pinned membrane comprises a small subspace within the configuration phase space of a free membrane .",
    "more precisely , we argued that this subspace includes the free membrane configurations in which the global minimum of the height function occurs at the pinning point of the corresponding supported membrane .",
    "we further argued that the relative size of the subspace is @xmath42 , which was based on the assumption that typically there is only one contact point with the surface and , therefore , this contact point must be the adhesion site .",
    "however , as we see from eq.([eq : contacts ] ) , a typical configuration makes @xmath81 contacts with the surface .",

    "\\label{eq : attachmentfenergy3}\\ ] ] notice that for sufficiently large @xmath76 , @xmath86 .",
    "indeed , the attachment of a free membrane to a surface is likely to be more costly than the attachment of stressed and harmonically confined membranes that exhibit reduced fluctuations and , thus , remain close to the surface anyway .",
    "let us look back at fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] which shows the pair correlation function between two adhesion points .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the scaling form eq.([eq : pair1 ] ) holds over almost the entire range of pair separations considered ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the deviations from the power law at small pair distances arising from the short range depletion forces between lipids have already been discussed in section [ sec : twopoints ] .",
    "what is quite surprising , though , is the pretty good agreement between the mc results and eq.([eq : pair1 ] ) at large pair distances .",
    "eq.([eq : pair1 ] ) has been derived for two adhesion points in a very large membrane , neglecting boundary effects . in the simulations the conditions are different",
    "- the membrane has a finite size and periodic boundary conditions are employed to reduce the finite size effects .",
    "thus , each adhesion point interacts not only with the other adhesion point but also with its infinite array of periodic images . nevertheless , the existence of periodic images seems to have a very small impact on the results .",
    "this observation is particularly unexpected for @xmath88 corresponding to situations where one of the adhesion points is equally close to two images of the other adhesion point . the only possible way to explain this surprising observation is to assume that the periodic images of the adhesion points are largely screened .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the following physical picture : the membrane mediated interactions originate from the entropic cost due to the suppression of the membrane thermal undulations .",
    "thus , the presence of each adhesion point is felt only in the region where it affects the fluctuations and cause their reduction , while outside of this region , the adhesion point is effectively screened . in this perspective , the idea that distant adhesion points are screened seems logical .",
    "the fluctuations vanish at each adhesion point , irrespective of the distribution of the others .",
    "moreover , in the immediate vicinity of each adhesion point , one expects the amplitude of the fluctuations to depend only on the distance from that adhesion point .",
    "if the membrane is neither stressed nor experiencing a confining surface potential , the amplitude of the fluctuations in this region grows linearly with the distance @xmath50 from the adhesion point , as given by eq.([eq : linear ] ) .",
    "we now wish to introduce a more general expression that holds over the entire area of the membrane and coincides with eq.([eq : linear ] ) close to every adhesion point .",
    "our suggestion is as follows @xcite : in each unit area of the membrane , the mean height of the membrane above the surface is given by ( compare with eq.([eq : linear ] ) ) @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the distance of the unit area from the _ nearest _ adhesion point .",
    "we also replace @xmath50 with @xmath90 in eq.([eq : fenergydensity2 ] ) for the attachment free energy density , which now reads @xmath91 the total attachment free energy of a given distribution of adhesion points is obtained by integrating the attachment free energy density eq.([eq : fenergydensity - many ] ) over the entire membrane area . this calculation",

    "the gas phase is characterized by a large number of small clusters , some of which may be of the size of a single site . furthermore , since each occupied site has a relatively small number of neighboring occupied sites , the mean configurational energy @xmath149 is relatively low .",
    "conversely , when the sites form large clusters in the condensed phase , @xmath150 is high , and the total number of clusters decreases ( and in many cases , especially for large values of @xmath119 , we simply observe only a single cluster in our system ) .",

    "to make a quantitative comparison between the theory and the simulations , one needs to estimate the parameter @xmath121 appearing in eq.([eq : b_parameter ] ) .",
    "several reasons make such an estimation difficult and inaccurate : first , our non - standard mean field theory is based on the assumption that the clusters are circular and roughly have the same size , which is quite a crude approximation .",
    "second , tracing the precise location of @xmath155 in fig .  [ fig:14 ] is largely inaccurate because of the finite size of the system that makes the transitions look like crossovers . to reduce the large uncertainties associated with the determination of @xmath155",

    "in this review we presented a statistical thermodynamics analysis of the aggregation behavior of adhesion points between a fluctuating membrane and a supporting surface .",
    "our analysis focused on the contribution of the membrane thermal fluctuations to this process , via the attractive interactions that they mediate between the adhesion points .",
    "the origin of the fluctuation - induced ( casimir - like ) interactions are the restrictions imposed on the membrane thermal fluctuations by the adhesion points , and the associated free energy cost which is minimized when the adhesion points localize in a cluster .",
    "we investigated both the two- and many - body fluctuation - induced interactions .",
    "for the two - body problem , our analysis reveals that the fluctuation induced pair potential is infinitely long - range with a logarithmic dependence on the pair distance .",
    "if , in addition to the excluded volume interactions , the membrane and the surface also interact via an attractive confining potential , the fluctuation - induced pair potential becomes screened at large distances .",
    "the screening of the pair potential is due to the fact that far away from each adhesion point , the amplitude of the fluctuations is governed by the strength of the external potential rather than by the presence of the other adhesion point .    in the many - body problem ,",
    "the fluctuation - induced interactions are self - screened .",
    "the amplitude of the thermal fluctuations at each unit area of the membrane is governed by the distance to the closest adhesion points , which implies that each point interacts only with a few nearby points .",
    "this justifies our mapping of the problem into the 2d lattice - gas model with an effectively larger ( `` renormalized '' ) interaction energy . depending on the strength of the renormalized interactions , the system may be either in a `` gas '' ( uniform distribution ) or a `` condensed '' ( adhesion cluster ) phase .",
    "the interesting question which arises is whether the fluctuation - induced contribution to the attraction is sufficiently strong to allow cluster formation .",
    "our analysis finds that the answer to this question is no .",
    "the fluctuation - induced interactions alone are too weak to induce the condensation transition .",
