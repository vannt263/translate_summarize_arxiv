    "interaction between conduction electrons and thermal phonons is elementary for many processes and phenomena at low temperatures , but there are still only few experimental studies supporting the theory for typical disordered metals .",
    "several earlier results indicated that both in ordered and disordered films the electron - phonon scattering rate follows power law @xmath3 @xcite , and thus the heating power from electrons to phonons is of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a material dependent parameter , @xmath6 the volume of the sample , @xmath7 the electron temperature and @xmath8 the phonon temperature .",
    "however , according to the theory this result is possible only for pure samples in the limit @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the wavevector of the dominant thermal phonons and @xmath11 the electron mean free path , coupling to longitudinal phonons only .    in disordered metals ,",
    "where @xmath12 , theory predicts that the scattering rate from vibrating disorder is @xmath13 @xcite so that the heating power is @xmath14 when electrons are expected to couple dominantly to transverse acoustical phonons @xcite .",
    "this result has not been widely confirmed , and in fact we are not aware of any observation of it in standard normal metal films like cu , au , ag , etc .",
    "some evidence exists for strongly disordered ( @xmath11 @xmath15 1 nm ) ti and hf films @xcite and si soi wafers @xcite .",
    "recently we have observed the theoretically expected @xmath0 dependence for e - p scattering rate in evaporated copper @xcite and gold films . we have measured the rate at which electrons in a normal metal wire overheat , when dc power is applied to it .",
    "overheating rate was determined directly by measuring the electron and phonon temperatures with help of sinis - thermometers .",
    "we have measured several cu samples with a range of film thicknesses and thus a range of @xmath11 , as reported earlier @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on comparing the data of one of those cu samples with new data from a au sample . to assess the quality of metal films and to determine the electron mean free path @xmath11",
    ", we measured the sample resistivities @xmath16 at 4.2 k and at room temperature in a four - probe configuration , and determined @xmath11 for the sub - kelvin range from the 4.2 k data .",
    "now we can estimate the critical phonon temperatures @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath18 by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the transverse sound velocity ( @xmath21=2300 m / s and @xmath22= 1200 m / s ) .",

    "the normal metal wires were connected to the measurement circuit by superconducting al leads as shown in the sem image [ fig:1 ] ( a ) .",
    "two pairs of current biased leads in both wires are sinis tunnel junctions for measuring the electron temperature of the wire .",
    "the junctions connecting the lower wire to a voltage source are ns - junctions for heating the normal metal . for low enough heating voltages",
    "the ns - junctions are biased within the superconducting gap @xmath25 of the leads , and andreev reflection can take place .",
    "this makes the ns - junctions perfect thermal insulators despite being electrically conducting , and thus it is possible to joule heat the normal metal uniformly through the ns - junctions .",
    "all the measurements were performed by current biasing the two sinis thermometers and measuring their dc voltages simultaneously in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature 60 mk .",
    "the thermometers were calibrated by varying the bath temperature of the refrigerator very slowly , while measuring the temperature of the sample stage with a calibrated ruthenium oxide thermometer .    .",
    "the junction is biased at @xmath26 pa according to responsivity @xmath27 measurement shown in the inset.,width=253,height=188 ]    figure [ fig:2 ] shows an example of a calibration measurement .",
    "it is evident that the agreement between measured calibration curve and corresponding theoretical curve calculated numerically from the bcs theory is good except at the very lowest temperatures .",
    "this deviation could arise by two major mechanisms:(i ) a component of leakage or noise current affects the measurement , and ( ii ) the electrons overheat at the low-@xmath28 range .",
    "we have ruled out ( i ) by directly measuring the responsitivities @xmath27 of the sinis - thermometers as a function of @xmath29 using a lock - in amplifier ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] inset ) , and setting the bias current such that we see the expected behavior from bcs theory ( @xmath27 decreasing vs. @xmath29 ) . mechanism ( ii ) , overheating by noise power @xmath30 , is an obvious explanation since we have seen that filtering the lines clearly improves the situation .",
    "overheating can be modelled with the help of theory for e - p scattering and the kapitza resistance @xcite and the model fits the data perfectly @xcite .",
    "thus , the thermometers are calibrated correctly by reading @xmath7 from the bcs - theory curve .",
    "in our experiment we applied slowly ramping dc voltage to joule heating the lower wire through ns - junctions and determined heating power by measuring the current and voltage directly in a 4-wire configuration at @xmath31 mk .",
    "simultaneously we measured the electron temperatures in a both wires by sinis - thermometers .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) we plot the electron temperatures in both wires vs @xmath32 obtained from several sweeps for both samples .",
    "as can be seen , the temperatures of both wires rise when heating power is increased .",
    "this means that the second wire is heated indirectly by phonons , since there is no direct electrical contact between the wires .",
    "therefore , there must be mechanism in the substrate to backscatter hot phonons generated in the lower wire .",
    "most likely this scattering take place in the oxide layer and/or at the interface between the oxide and the substrate .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) , above a few pw this phonon heating clearly dominates the signal over the noise heating in the upper , non - joule heated wire ( labelled @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus we can identify this as the phonon temperature @xmath8 , since all the power absorbed from the phonons has to be re - emitted back into the substrate .",
    "moreover , since the two wires are separated only by @xmath15 2 @xmath24 m , much shorter than lateral mean free path of phonons in sio @xcite , the same @xmath8 is seen by the lower wire also .",
    "the conclusion is that we can simultaneously measure the electron and phonon temperatures of the heated wire .",
    "looking back at fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) we can see that for both samples @xmath7 and @xmath8 scale as @xmath34 .",
    "since the approximation @xmath35 holds for both samples , we can conclude from the behaviour of @xmath7 alone that equation ( [ disorder ] ) is valid , and e - p scattering is mediated by vibrating disorder . however , empirically the relation @xmath36 also holds for both samples , which explains why in the data of fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) @xmath37 also .",
    "the physical reason for this empirical observation is not clear .     and @xmath8 vs heating power @xmath32 in log - log scale",

    "it can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( b ) that @xmath41 does not fit the data .",
    "this means that kapitza resistance or e - p scattering by static impurities is not in a dominant role .",
    "also the expected theory for pure samples , @xmath42 , does not fit the data according to the curve shown in fig . [",
    "fig:3](c ) .",
    "however from fig .",
    "[ fig:3](d ) we can see that @xmath43 gives straight line for both samples and thus evidence for the validity of equation ( [ disorder ] ) . from the linear",
    "fits through the origin we get @xmath44w / k@xmath45m@xmath46 for the copper sample and @xmath47w / k@xmath45m@xmath46 for the gold sample .",
    "it should be stressed that in the disordered regime @xmath48 is not only a material dependent parameter but depends directly on the level of disorder through @xmath11 @xcite . for comparisons between different measurements , therefore , both @xmath48 and @xmath11 need to be quoted . also , it is unclear at the moment why the au sample follows the disorder theory , although it has @xmath49 if calculated for transverse modes ( table 1 ) . for longtitudinal modes",
    "it is still in the @xmath50 limit .",
    "we have for the first time obtained clear evidence that the electron - phonon scattering rate scales with temperature as @xmath51 in disordered evaporated cu and au thin films .",
    "this power law corresponds to electrons scattering from phonons mediated by disorder vibrating together with the phonon mode . in contrast",
    ", e - p scattering in the presence of static disorder leads to @xmath52 , a result that has been confirmed in several materials and samples @xcite .",
    "we stress that the theoretical result @xmath53 is valid for a simple metal with @xmath54 and little nonvibrating disorder , and with 3d phonons coupled to electrons by the deformation potential .",
    "we believe most earlier experiments do not satisfy all these conditions .",
