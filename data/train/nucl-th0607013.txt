    "since the discovery of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , many efforts have been made to understand the structure of hadrons and hadron - hadron interactions based on this fundamental theory of the strong interaction .",
    "see , e.g. , a review article @xcite for these efforts .",
    "such studies are of crucial importance in understanding many - body systems of nuclei and hadronic matter .",
    "a direct derivation of these elements from qcd , however , involves tremendous difficulties such as the quark confinement and multi - gluon effects in the low - energy phenomena .",
    "this has motivated a study using other effective models which take account of some important qcd characteristics like the color degree of freedom , one - gluon exchange , etc .",
    ", even though they may not be rigorously derived from qcd .    in this review article",
    ", we will focus on the interactions between the octet - baryons ( @xmath0 ) , studied in the non - relativistic quark model ( qm ) , and their applications to light nuclear systems .",
    "the qm study of the baryon - baryon interaction started from applying the three - quark ( @xmath32 ) model for the nucleon ( @xmath33 ) to the @xmath24-@xmath24 system , in order to obtain a microscopic understanding of the short - range repulsion of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) interaction .",
    "almost 30 years ago liberman @xcite first calculated the quark - exchange kernel of the phenomenological confinement potential and the @xmath34-type color - magnetic interaction originating from the fermi - breit ( fb ) interaction .",
    "the latter was suggested by de rjula , georgi and glashow @xcite as a possible candidate of the quark - quark ( @xmath35 ) residual interaction based on the asymptotic freedom of qcd .",
    "the effect of antisymmetrization among quarks is most straightforwardly taken into account in the framework of a microscopic nuclear cluster model , the resonating - group method ( rgm ) .",
    "the rgm equation for the @xmath24-@xmath24 system was solved by oka and yazaki @xcite not only for the @xmath2 interaction , but also for the @xmath36 interaction .",
    "harvey @xcite pointed out the appearance of the so - called hidden - color components in the many - quark systems .",
    "the nature of the repulsive core of the @xmath2 interaction was studied by faessler , fernandez , lbeck and shimizu @xcite in the framework of rgm , including @xmath2 , @xmath36 and the hidden - color channels .",
    "these early studies were followed by a number of works @xcite , which repeatedly confirmed that the medium- and long - range effects , usually described by meson - exchange potentials , are absent in the qm and must be incorporated to obtain a realistic description of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the first such attempt for the @xmath2 interaction was carried out @xcite by supplementing the well - established one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) and a phenomenological medium - range central potential in the schrdinger - type equation equivalent to the rgm equation .",
    "the deuteron properties were investigated in relation with the compact @xmath37-bag configuration @xcite .",
    "the most successful calculation of the @xmath2 interaction in this approach was given in ref .",
    "the authors introduced the spin - spin and non - central terms of the opep , assuming that the pions directly couple with the quarks in the @xmath24 core , and thereby yielding an effective - meson exchange potential ( emep ) at the baryon level .",
    "an alternative approach is to assume opep between the quarks in the rgm formalism and to calculate the quark - exchange kernel explicitly @xcite .",
    "this program was carried out by the tbingen group  @xcite , who extended the model of the @xmath2 interaction to the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath26 ) and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath38 ) interactions as well .",
    "their approach includes a pseudoscalar ( ps ) meson exchange between the quarks as well as a phenomenological @xmath39-like potential at the baryon level . a fully microscopic calculation including both ps- and @xmath39-meson exchange potentials at the quark level was undertaken by the salamanca group @xcite for the @xmath2 interaction in the framework of the chiral qm .",
    "this model was further extended by the beijing group @xcite to a chiral @xmath40 model with strangeness degree of freedom , and applied to the @xmath26 and @xmath38 interactions . in the meantime ,",
    "meson - exchange models have also made a progress in the description of the medium - range attraction of the @xmath26 interaction .",
    "the new jlich @xmath26 model @xcite has discussed the contributions of the scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath39 ) and vector - isovector ( @xmath41 ) exchange channels , constrained by a microscopic model of correlated @xmath42 and @xmath43 exchanges .",
    "the extended nijmegen soft - core model esc04 @xcite has introduced two ps - meson exchange and meson - pair exchange , in addition to the standard one - boson exchange and short - range diffractive exchange potentials .",
    "our viewpoint for applying the rgm formalism to the baryon - baryon interactions is that the @xmath1 qm with some realistic modifications like peripheral mesonic or @xmath44 effects can essentially reproduce the whole low - energy hadronic phenomena .",
    "for the low - energy phenomena related to the @xmath45-wave ground - state hadrons , the predictions with the fb interaction of the one - gluon exchange have no apparent disagreement with experiment except for some trivial cases . though the fb spin - orbit ( @xmath46 ) interaction is believed not to be favorable for the very small energy splitting of the negative - parity nucleon excited states , known as the `` missing @xmath46 force problem '' of the @xmath47-wave baryons , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this problem can be resolved by a proper treatment of a compact @xmath24 structure embedded in the @xmath48 continua . in other papers @xcite , we showed that the same fb @xmath46 force has almost right order of magnitude compatible with the experimental information on the @xmath2 and @xmath26 spin - orbit interaction .",
    "fujiwara and hecht discussed in  @xcite the off - shell fb interaction in the non - relativistic framework and incorporated the meson - exchange effects to the @xmath24-@xmath24 rgm by explicitly introducing @xmath44 and @xmath49 excitations .",
    "as the main feature of the @xmath2 interaction was reproduced in the extended qm without introducing any extra meson parameters , it may be considered the first step toward the conventional meson - exchange description through a possible mechanism of @xmath44 exchanges between nucleons .",
    "an extension of the model to include the antiquark degree of freedom is also made to describe other hadronic interactions such as the pion - pion and pion - nucleon scatterings as well as the proton - antiproton annihilation processes @xcite .",
    "we note that to apply the rgm formalism to the @xmath24-@xmath24 system is not straightforward , since there are some new features arising from the intrinsically relativistic nature of the system .",
    "the standard non - relativistic rgm formulation should be augmented with the following features : 1 ) the full fb interaction with flavor - symmetry breaking ( fsb ) , including the momentum - dependent breit retardation term and the galilean non - invariant @xmath46 term , 2 ) a @xmath50 harmonic - oscillator ( h.o . ) wave function with a common size parameter @xmath51 for all the @xmath24 systems , 3 ) a perturbative treatment of the fsb , in terms of the pure @xmath1 qm wave functions with the [ 3]-symmetric spatial function , and 4 ) correct reduced masses and threshold energies in the rgm formalism . see refs .",
    "@xcite for the background of these extensions .",
    "the effective @xmath35 interaction in our model consists of a phenomenological quark - confining potential , the one - gluon exchange fb interaction , and other terms generating emep s from various meson - exchange mechanisms .",
    "various versions of our qm for the baryon - baryon interactions emerge from several possibilities of how to incorporate these emep s in the rgm equation .",
    "a simplest method is to use effective local potentials @xmath52 at the baryon level , which are determined from the existing one - boson exchange potentials ( obep ) with some adjustable parameters . from the correspondence between the rgm formalism for composite particles and the schrdinger equation for structureless particles",
    ", the relative - motion wave function should be renormalized with the square root of the normalization kernel @xmath53 .",
    "a nice point of this prescription is that we only need the normalization kernel to generate the exchange terms . our earliest version of the qm , * rgm - f * @xcite , uses this prescription for emep s , where @xmath52 is assumed to be proportional to the scalar- ( s- ) meson and ps - meson exchange potentials of the nijmegen model - f @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the central force of the s - meson nonet and the tensor force of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 mesons in the nijmegen model - f are used . with only two adjustable parameters determined in the @xmath2 sector ,",
    "rgm - f can reproduce reasonably well all the low - energy cross section data of the @xmath26 systems .",
    "in the next step , we have improved the way of introducing the emep s in two respects .",
    "one is to calculate the spin - flavor factors exactly at the quark level and the other is to include the spin - spin terms originating from all the ps mesons .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the available @xmath2 and @xmath26 data can simultaneously be reproduced in the standard @xmath24-@xmath24 formulation , if one assumes the full ps- and s - meson nonet exchanges at the quark level and properly introduces the fsb in the quark sector .",
    "an explicit evaluation of quark - exchange kernels for the emep leads to a strong constraint on the flavor dependence of each @xmath2 and @xmath26 channel .",
    "the @xmath40 relation of the coupling constants emerges as a natural consequence of the @xmath1 qm . for s mesons , one of the @xmath40 parameters , @xmath56 ratio , turns out to take the @xmath1 value of a purely electric type . under this restriction , the low - energy @xmath2 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 total cross sections",
    "can not be reproduced consistently with a unique mixing angle of the flavor - singlet and octet s mesons .",
    "we resolve this problem in two ways ; one is to change the mixing angle only for @xmath25 channel and the other is to employ the same approximation as rgm - f , changing the @xmath56 ratio , solely for the isoscalar s mesons , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these models are called * fss * and * rgm - h * @xcite , respectively . since their predictions",
    "are not much different except for the roles of the @xmath61 force in the @xmath10@xmath62 coupled - channels ( cc ) system , the result with fss will be discussed in this article .    in the most recent model called * fss2 * @xcite",
    ", we have also included the following interaction pieces mediated by s and vector ( v ) mesons : @xmath46 , quadratic spin - orbit ( @xmath63 ) , and momentum - dependent bryan - scott terms .",
    "the introduction of these terms to the emep s is primarily motivated by the insufficient description of the @xmath2 experimental data with our previous models .",
    "due to these improvements , the @xmath2 phase shifts at non - relativistic energies up to @xmath3 have attained an accuracy almost comparable to that of obep s .",
    "the model parameters are searched in the isospin basis to fit the @xmath2 phase - shift analysis with @xmath64 and @xmath65 mev , the deuteron binding energy , the @xmath17 @xmath2 scattering length , and the low - energy @xmath26 total cross section data .",
    "the model fss2 reproduces the @xmath26 scattering data and the essential features of the @xmath10@xmath11 coupling equally well with our previous models .",
    "another important progress for the qm baryon - baryon interaction has come from a technique to solve the rgm equation in the momentum representation .",
    "here we solve the @xmath66-matrix equation of the rgm kernel , for which all the born terms are derived analytically .",
    "the partial wave decomposition of the born kernel is carried out numerically in the gauss - legendre integral quadrature .",
    "this method , called lippmann - schwinger rgm ( ls - rgm ) @xcite , enables us not only to obtain very stable and accurate results for the @xmath45-matrix over a wide energy range up to a few gev , but also to apply our qm baryon - baryon interactions to physically interesting problems such as @xmath6-matrix and three - cluster faddeev calculations . the single - particle ( s.p . ) potentials of the @xmath0 ( @xmath33 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 ) and the strength of the s.p .",
    "spin - orbit potential are predicted through the @xmath6-matrix calculations @xcite .",
    "we have carried out coupled - channels rgm ( ccrgm ) calculations both in the isospin basis and in the physical particle basis .",
    "the former is convenient to show concisely the characteristics of the @xmath4 interactions , but the latter is necessary to make a realistic evaluation of cross sections for a comparison with experimental data .",
    "the latter is also necessary for the study of the charge dependence of the @xmath2 interaction and the charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) of the @xmath10 interaction .",
    "the charge - independence breaking ( cib ) is partially explained by the so - called pion - coulomb correction @xcite , which implies 1 ) the small mass difference of the neutron and the proton , 2 ) the mass difference of the charged pions and the neutral pion , and 3 ) the coulomb effect . for the csb of the @xmath10 interaction , the early version of the nijmegen potential @xcite already focused on this csb in the obep including the pion - coulomb correction and the correct threshold energies of the @xmath10@xmath11 coupling in the particle basis .",
    "we always include the pion - coulomb correction when the particle basis is used for the calculation .",
    "for the coulomb effect , we calculate the full exchange kernel without any approximation .",
    "the pion - coulomb correction and the correct treatment of the threshold energies are found to be very important to analyze the low - energy observables in the @xmath11@xmath10 cc problem .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the formulation of the @xmath24-@xmath24 rgm and its application to the @xmath6-matrix and faddeev calculations .",
    "these formulations are made in the momentum representation .",
    "the essential points to be emphasized include the energy dependence of the rgm kernel and the existence of the pauli - forbidden state . the treatment of the coulomb force in the momentum representation is also given .",
    "section 3 presents results and discussions .",
    "we start with the two - nucleon properties and proceed to the @xmath26 interaction , the @xmath6-matrix calculations , the @xmath38 interaction and the other @xmath4 interactions including the @xmath13 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 interactions .",
    "the importance of the spin - flavor @xmath1 symmetry in our qm framework is stressed through a systematic analysis of the phase - shift behavior and total cross sections in some particular channels . in sec .",
    "3.4 , our qm baryon - baryon interactions , fss and fss2 , are applied to the calculations of the triton and hypertriton binding energies in the three - cluster faddeev formalism .",
    "the application to other light hypernuclei , @xmath20 and @xmath30 , is given in sec .  3.5 .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath20 excited states is also examined by the faddeev and @xmath6-matrix calculations .",
    "a summary is drawn in sec .",
    "the rgm is a microscopic theory which describes the dynamical motion of clusters , on the basis of two- ( and three- , @xmath69 ) body interactions of constituent particles . for the application to baryon - baryon interactions in the qm , the @xmath0 s",

    "a nice property of the present rgm formalism is that the internal - energy contribution is already subtracted in the exchange kernel .",
    "namely , @xmath179 in for the central components @xmath180 , @xmath175 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 is defined through its corresponding original exchange kernel @xmath183 : @xmath184 where @xmath185 denotes the @xmath169-term contribution to the internal energy of the @xmath0 specified by the flavor label @xmath186 .",
    "owing to this subtraction , the mass term of the kinetic - energy operator in as well as the confinement potential with @xmath187 exactly cancels between the first and the second terms on the right - hand side of .",
    "we consider this feature one of the advantages of the rgm formalism , because the present qm produces those results which are independent of the strength of the confinement potential and are insensitive to the details of the confinement phenomenology .",
    "we should note that the original hamiltonian ( [ form13 ] ) in general contains the derivative operators @xmath188 and @xmath189 , which can not be reduced to the derivative of the relative coordinate @xmath190 between two quarks .",
    "the appearance of these galilean non - invariant terms , like the momentum - dependent breit retardation term @xmath191 and the antisymmetric @xmath46 term @xmath192 , is a direct consequence of the more strict lorentz invariance at the relativistic level , and their rgm kernel should be explicitly evaluated in the total c.m .",
    "system @xcite .",
    "we include the @xmath191 term and take account of its contribution to the relative kinetic - energy term explicitly .",
    "even with this procedure , the calculated reduced mass of the @xmath11 system is degenerate with that of the @xmath10 system .",
    "this is one of the limitations of the non - relativistic qm , in which the inertia masses ( of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the present case ) are not always reproduced correctly . in order to use the correct reduced masses in the ccrgm equation , we make the following replacement only for the exchange kernels @xmath193 and @xmath194 : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the incident channel .",
    "( this prescription is slightly different from that of refs .",
    "@xcite . ) for such a case that the exact pauli - forbidden state exists in the cc system , a modification is necessary as discussed in sec .  4 of ref .",
    "the essential idea is as follows .",
    "let us express the ccrgm equation ( [ form15 ] ) as @xmath197 with @xmath198 and @xmath199 . here",
    "@xmath200 represents the rgm kernel in with @xmath201 the direct potential , @xmath6 the exchange kernel @xmath202 , and @xmath55 the exchange normalization kernel @xmath203 .",
    "the essential feature of the rgm equation ( [ form19 ] ) is the existence of the trivial solution @xmath204 , which satisfies @xmath205 .",
    "if we use the projection operator on the pauli - allowed space , @xmath206 , can equivalently be written as @xmath207 in this form , we can safely replace the calculated reduced mass @xmath208 with the empirical mass @xmath209 .",
    "quite obviously , this procedure is accurate only when the calculated mass is a good approximation for the empirical mass . the same procedure is also applied when we formulate the ccrgm equation in the particle basis .",
    "the present constituent qm does not reproduce the small mass difference of the isospin multiplets exactly even if the fsb of the quark masses and the coulomb interaction at the quark level are properly introduced .",
    "we therefore solve the modified equation @xmath210 instead of , where @xmath211 and @xmath212 are defined by @xmath213 this procedure to use the empirical reduced masses and threshold energies in the pauli - allowed model space has a wide applicability to remedy the inflexibility of the rgm framework .",
    "if we restore to the original schdinger - type equation ( [ form19 ] ) , we obtain an additional correction term to the rgm kernel , which is supposed to be small enough for practical calculations , but necessary to preserve the exact treatment of the pauli principle : @xmath214 here @xmath215 is given by @xmath216 with @xmath217 a detailed example is given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath10@xmath218 ccrgm , which involves a pauli - forbidden state in the @xmath103 @xmath40 representation for the @xmath17 state @xcite . with this procedure",
    "we can employ the empirical reduced masses and threshold energies without impairing the major role of the pauli principle .      in this subsection",
    ", we outline a procedure to derive the rgm kernel , starting from a general form of the @xmath35 interaction , and discuss appropriate forms of the emep s used in the model fss and fss2 .",
    "refer to the original papers @xcite for detailed calculations .    .",
    "the coefficients @xmath219 , the corresponding spatial functions @xmath220 , and the spin - flavor operators @xmath221 for the fermi - breit interaction .",
    "the quark pair @xmath222 is assumed .",
    "for the non - central terms , the angular - momentum coupling @xmath223^{(0 ) } w^c$ ] etc . should be taken . [",
