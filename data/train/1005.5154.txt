    "there has been much recent debate on the nature of a coherence scale for heavy fermion systems , which characterizes the evolution of @xmath0-electrons from the localized magnetic moments to itinerant quasiparticles  @xcite . in experiments",
    "this scale is manifested as the temperature @xmath1 above which the quasiparticle signatures vanish , for example , the drude peak in the optical conductivity disappears , the magnetic entropy becomes @xmath2 , and the resistivity ( from magnetic ions ) reaches a maximum value .",
    "traditionally , this is associated with the single - ion kondo temperature @xmath3 which characterizes the kondo renormalization of @xmath0-electrons to quasiparticles by forming spin singlet resonance state with conduction electrons .",
    "it is not known _ a priori _ that such a single impurity picture is applicable to the lattice , where magnetic ions are coupled by intersite interactions .",
    "this can be examined , for instance , by tuning the concentrations of magnetic ions in a parent non - magnetic compound while the dilute and dense limits provide information on the single - ion kondo behavior and the kondo lattice behavior with coupled local moments , respectively .",
    "one of such studies is on ce@xmath4la@xmath5coin@xmath6 and it is found that @xmath1 increases from the ce - dilute limit with the increase of the concentration @xmath7 and can become one order of magnitude larger in the dense limit  @xcite .",
    "an extensive analysis on a group of heavy fermion compounds displaying quantum critical properties  @xcite shows that @xmath1 for these materials are indeed bigger than @xmath3 .",
    "it is further discovered that @xmath1 scales as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the density of states of conduction electrons at the fermi energy and @xmath10 is the onsite kondo coupling between spins of magnetic ions and conduction electrons .",
    "this is the scaling form for the intersite spin exchange interaction , namely , ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction @xmath11 , rather than the single - ion kondo temperature @xmath12 .    to resolve the discrepancy between @xmath1 and @xmath3 therefore relies on the understanding of the interplay between the intersite coupling and the onsite kondo coupling .",
    "while the associated lattice models for heavy fermion systems are in general difficult to solve , the two - impurity anderson model ( or the equivalent two - impurity kondo model ) presents such a competition effect in an exactly solvable way . with the assistance of the cluster dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )",
    ", a self - consistently solved two - impurity model also provides a solution to the anderson lattice model  @xcite . in the two - impurity anderson ( or kondo ) model ,",
    "an antiferromagnetic rkky interaction between two local moments favors an inter - impurity spin singlet state which competes with the kondo singlet state , which is similar to the same type of competition in heavy fermion systems  @xcite .",
    "it is known that for ferromagnetic rkky interactions and a range of antiferromagnetic rkky interaction , the evolution from the ( high energy ) local moment state to the ( low energy ) kondo resonance state or the inter - impurity singlet state is through a two - stage process , characterized by two energy scales .",
    "previous studies on this model were focused on the low energy scale , which characterizes the quantum phase transition or crossover between the two types of ground states  @xcite .",
    "the high energy scale , however , receives little attention hitherto , which is the focus of this study .",
    "while there are indications that it may be related to the single - ion kondo temperature or rkky interaction scale , there are no systematic studies on its scaling behavior and its associated physical properties , especially , when rkky interaction is much bigger than the single - ion kondo temperature .",
    "the reason to carry out this study is that , we show , this high energy scale shares the same properties as the coherence scale defined for the heavy fermion systems . following the experimental definition",
    ", we denote this high energy scale as the coherence scale for coupled anderson(kondo ) impurities  @xcite .    besides the difference in the focus on the coherence scale , our study differs from previous ones in the following aspects .",
    "1 ) we calculate the @xmath13 uniform and staggered spin susceptibilities in addition to the spectral functions ( the imaginary parts of the single - particle green s functions ) .",
    "we carry out an extended analysis on these dynamical quantities , for instance , a scaling analysis , and employ different quantities to identify and determine the characteristic energy scales .",
    "therefore , we provide a detailed account for the physical properties associated with these energy scales .",
    "2 ) we calculate these dynamical quantities with the recently - developed complete - fock - space numerical renormalization group method  @xcite .",
    "this method was developed to overcome the spectral weight loss in the intermediate and high energy range from traditional patching scheme in dynamical quantity calculations  @xcite , which becomes severe in the two - impurity problem with a larger eigen space .",
    "this approach is essential for determining the coherence scale which falls in this energy range . in particular , we show by a comparison that the results from the patching scheme may lead to a misleading understanding of the coherence scale . to our best knowledge",
    ", this is also the first practice to generalize this method to multi - impurity models .",
    "3 ) it is also important to choose a system for which the single - ion kondo temperature @xmath3 and the inter - impurity spin exchange interaction @xmath11 can be easily determined or directly given , which the identified characteristic energy scales can be compared to .",
    "we present results for two systems where two impurities are located far away from each other and at nearest neighbors on a three dimensional cubic lattice . for two impurities located far away , rkky interaction , which is generated from the virtual exchange of conduction electrons , is found to vanish .",
    "theoretically , we can add a direct spin exchange term to simulate rkky interaction effect  @xcite .",
    "this system has been studied earlier , and we repeat the calculations on this system because it provides a reference system for the single - ion kondo physics where @xmath3 can be determined .",
    "we also provide new results for @xmath14 . for two impurities sitting on nearest neighbors , a finite antiferromagnetic rkky interaction between two impurities",
    "is found to be generated perturbatively in the order of @xmath8 , and is antiferromagnetic .",
    "as @xmath3 and @xmath11 are tuned in the same fashion as in realistic heavy fermion systems , this system provides a direct comparison to the experiments on the scaling behaviors of the characteristic energy scales .",
    "it also reveals an origin for a parity - splitting term which is inherent to the heavy fermion systems .    from our numerical studies on the above two systems ,",
    "we can in general identify two characteristic energy scales for two coupled anderson impurities . while the ground state is found to be always a fermi liquid fixed point ,",
    "either a kondo resonance state or the inter - impurity singlet state controlled by rkky interaction , the low energy scale @xmath15 serves as the ( local ) fermi liquid scale where fermi liquid behaviors emerge .",
    "the high energy scale @xmath16 is found to be a spin fluctuation scale , where the imaginary parts of the spin susceptibilities reach their maximum values : the origin can be the kondo spin - flip scattering or inter - impurity singlet to triplet excitation . in either case , the single - particle ( charge ) excitation gains considerable weight .",
    "we further find that @xmath16 for both systems has the same behavior : it increases from @xmath3 and then becomes @xmath11 when @xmath17 increases .",
    "this can be explained by whether the kondo renormalization can reach @xmath3 or is already cutoff by the inter - impurity singlet to triplet excitation gap .",
    "our results indicate that the physical properties above @xmath16 are still determined by the single - ion kondo physics , which allows us to make an argument that @xmath16 can be generalized to the lattice system . @xmath18 and",
    "its physical properties imply that it is consistent with the coherence scale @xmath1 defined for heavy fermion systems . for completeness",
    ", we also show the behavior of @xmath15 , which is the characteristic energy scale for the phase transition or crossover and is consistent with previous studies .",
    "@xmath15 has different behaviors in the two considered systems due to two different origins , the proximity to a degeneracy point of the two competing grounds states and a parity - splitted quasiparticle hopping term .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the two - impurity anderson model and the numerical method we adopted .",
    "the results for the direct and generated rkky interaction cases are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : twoscale ] , where two energy scales are identified and their properties are characterized .",
    "we focus our discussions on the high energy scale , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] , where we show that the scaling behavior of this scale and its associated physical properties are consistent with those of the coherence scale identified in the heavy fermion systems . in appendix",
    ", we provide some technical details on how to evaluate @xmath3 and rkky interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - impurity anderson model can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 sums over two impurity sites .",
    "this describes two interacting local orbitals @xmath21 ( anderson impurities ) embedded in a non - interacting conduction electron medium @xmath22 with the system size @xmath23 and in hybridization with @xmath22 with the strength @xmath24 at each impurity site @xmath25 .",

    "@xmath11 is a direct spin exchange interaction between two impurity spins . in reality",
    ", such term , known as rkky interaction , is perturbatively generated through a virtual process exchanging conduction electrons . in the single occupancy limit of each orbital",
    ", this model can be mapped into a two - impurity kondo model ( some details are presented in appendix ) .    by taking the even or odd parity combinations of the local orbitals @xmath28",
    ", the fluctuations due to conduction electrons can be represented by two separate baths with the hybridization functions @xmath29\\;. \\label{eq : hybfunc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our calculation we assume @xmath30 and a three dimensional tight - binding dispersion @xmath31 for conduction electrons with @xmath32 the half - bandwidth and @xmath33 the lattice constant .",
    "we consider two cases with impurities located far away [ case ( i ) ] and at nearest neighbor lattice sites [ case ( ii ) ] , where @xmath34 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 for these two cases can therefore be determined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybfunc ] ) .",
    "subsequently we can determine the kondo coupling @xmath10 and the generated rkky interaction @xmath11 while the calculation details are presented in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we find that the hybridization functions for case ( i ) and case ( ii ) can be written as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , where @xmath38 .",
    "we take @xmath39 and @xmath40 in both cases .",
    "the kondo coupling constant is found to be @xmath41 .",
    "the generated rkky interaction vanishes in case ( i ) , indicating that it is effectively a single - ion kondo problem , from which we can determine @xmath3 .",
    "theoretically , we add a direct spin exchange term @xmath42 to simulate rkky interaction . in case ( ii )",
    ", an antiferromagnetic rkky interaction is perturbatively generated , which is determined to be @xmath43 ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "therefore we no longer need to add a direct spin exchange term .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 can be tuned by varying the kondo coupling since @xmath11 and @xmath3 have different dependencies on @xmath10 . in our calculation , this is achieved by varying @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "this impurity problem is amenable to the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method  @xcite , which prescribes a non - perturbative procedure to capture the low energy properties .",
    "it discretizes the hybridization function into a chain of electron orbitals with the energy decreasing in logarithmic scale . in the two - impurity problem ,",
    "as protected by the parity symmetry , @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be discretized separately .",
    "while only the head site of the chain couples to the impurities , we can solve the original model by an iterative diagonalization to incorporate gradually more low energy sites .",
    "in practice , as the eigen space increases with more sites included in each iteration , only certain number of low energy states are kept for the next iteration . from these nrg eigenstates",
    ", we can calculate dynamical quantities , @xmath48_\\pm \\rangle$ ] , in particular , the green s function @xmath49 with @xmath50 , the uniform ( @xmath51 ) and staggered ( @xmath52 ) impurity spin susceptibilities , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "traditionally , these quantities are calculated from the kept states from all iterations .",
    "however , kept states from different iterations are not necessarily orthogonal to each other .",
    "a patching scheme is adopted to avoid the overlap contributions , for instance , in ref .",
    "this is to choose a weight function for the overlap spectrum between different iterations .",
    "the arbitrariness of the weight function leads to the inaccuracy of these dynamical quantities . the recently developed complete - fock - space ( cfs )",
    "method  @xcite overcomes this problem , which we adopt in our calculation .",
    "it instead calculates dynamical quantities from all the discarded states ( including all states from the final iteration ) , which is found to form an orthogonal fock space conserving the total spectral density . although the calculation time almost doubles with an additional backward iteration to determine the reduced density matrix , we find that the improvement in dynamical quantities is significant , especially in the energy range near and above @xmath3 , which is of interest to our study .",
    "we will show a comparison for these methods in fig .",
    "[ fig : specomp ] .",
    "while we typically choose a discretization parameter @xmath55 and keep 4000 lowest energy states in each iteration , we find that by choosing a smaller @xmath56 or keeping more states , the dynamical quantities have little change in the high energy range .",
    "we first consider case ( i ) , two impurities located far away from each other which can be represented by @xmath57 .",
    "although this case has been studied earlier  @xcite , we re - examine it here for two considerations .",
    "firstly , as shown below , it provides a reference system to the single - ion kondo physics when the direct spin exchange term is not added .",
    "@xmath3 can be determined .",
    "secondly , it is a rare system exhibiting a quantum critical point with the added direct spin exchange term , with or without particle - hole symmetry ( this is related to the vanishing parity - splitting potential scattering term ) .",
    "the results of the spectral function @xmath58 , imaginary parts of the uniform ( @xmath59 ) and staggered ( @xmath60 ) spin susceptibilities are shown in fig .",

    "is also set to 1 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the land factor and the bohr magneton , respectively .     in case ( i ) , two impurities located far away but coupled with a direct spin exchange interaction @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath68 in ( b ) are represented by dotted and solid lines , respectively . here",

    "therefore , the spin dynamics , which controls the low energy properties , is the same as in the single - impurity anderson model . in finite @xmath27 case ,",
    "the anderson model differs from its kondo counterpart in additional features in high energies , i.e. , the incoherent peaks of @xmath79 at @xmath80 and @xmath81 corresponding to the free - orbital fixed point . in general , there exists an additional energy scale characterizing the evolution from the free - orbital fixed point to ( or close to ) the local moment fixed - point , where charge fluctuations freeze and @xmath79 is small . in the kondo limit , @xmath82",
    ", these two fixed points can be thought of being pushed to the infinite energy .",
    "the low energy physics is controlled by the kondo renormalization from the local moment fixed - point to the strongly - coupling kondo fixed point , and can be characterized by a single energy scale , the single - ion kondo temperature @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath3 is also a spin - fluctuation scale , indicating the spin fluctuations , originated from the kondo spin - flip scatterings , reach the maximal strength .",
    "as the @xmath84 kondo fixed point is a fermi lqiuid fixed point with scattering phase shift @xmath85 , ( local ) fermi liquid behaviors , such as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , emerge when @xmath88 ( @xmath89 is smaller than @xmath3 but is not an independent scale as it is proportional to @xmath3 ) .",

    "we find that @xmath92 , and @xmath93 by these two relations , and we determine @xmath94 .    upon adding an antiferromagnetic spin exchange interaction @xmath11 , the low energy properties have changed : the spectral function",
    "is reduced from an energy scale around @xmath3 , then then either increases again to the full weight @xmath95 or decreases to 0 [ a pseudogap state with @xmath96 , verified by a log - log plot ] at a lower energy scale .",
    "the abrupt spectral weight change at the fermi energy is a signature of the two - impurity quantum phase transition  @xcite : the ground state changes from a kondo resonance states with two impurity spins forming kondo singlets with the conduction electrons , to an inter - impurity spin singlet states with two impurity spins forming singlets by themselves and being decoupled from the conduction electrons .",
    "the critical values is found to be @xmath97 which is also consistent with previous studies  @xcite .",
    "apparently , the single - ion kondo picture with a single scale , @xmath3 , no longer applies and two energy scales are needed to explain the dynamical quantities . on both sides of the critical point ,",

    "this can also be evidenced from the thermodynamics calculated from nrg  @xcite that the entropy ( per impurity ) for this state is @xmath155 .",
    "while @xmath156 in case ( i ) indicates the proximity to the degeneracy point between the kondo resonance state and inter - impurity singlet state , the finite @xmath15 in case ( ii ) is due to another effect . in case ( ii ) , the particle - hole symmetry is actually broken in each channel due to the presence of a parity - splitting potential scattering term @xmath157 .",
    "it is shown  @xcite that such term will generate a coupling between the other half of the impurity degrees of freedom ( the other flavor of majorana fermion ) and the extended degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , there is always a finite quasiparticle spectral weight at the fermi energy .",
    "the fl temperature is also finite @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "we notice that such a parity - splitting term can also be generated by other forms of particle - hole asymmetry , such as a hybridization ( hopping ) term @xmath159  @xcite , the asymmetry in energy dependence of kondo coupling  @xcite or a regular potential scattering term  @xcite . compared with these studies , case ( ii ) we studied here",
    "points out an origin for the parity - splitting term which is inherent to the heavy fermion systems , and can not be tuned away .",
    "while the properties of @xmath15 are the focus of previous studies on this model  @xcite and our results are in agreement with these studies , we focus our discussions on scaling behavior and the properties of @xmath16 which has received little attention .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : phsym](c ) and  [ fig : tscale](b ) , @xmath16 has the same scaling behavior in the two cases studied above : @xmath160 ( or @xmath11 ) for @xmath147 ( or @xmath161 ) and a value in - between when @xmath11 and @xmath3 are comparable . when @xmath147 , the kondo effect dominates .",
    "a small rkky interaction in this limit only enhances slightly the staggered spin fluctuations and affects the physical properties in the energy range @xmath162 while the kondo renormalization above @xmath3 remains unaffected .",
    "therefore , @xmath163 in this limit .",
    "@xmath3 lies in the crossover region between the local moment and the strong coupling fixed points in the single - ion kondo renormalization .",
    "correspondingly , the imaginary parts of the spin susceptibilities change behaviors at @xmath3 from @xmath164 to @xmath165 , i.e , the spin fluctuations reach the maximum strength associated with the spin - flip kondo scattering .",
    "the quasiparticle spectral weight also increases rapidly at @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , @xmath16 ( being @xmath3 ) serves as the onset scale for the formation of coherent quasiparticles .",
    "we notice that quasiparticles at this energy scale do not necessarily exhibit fermi liquid behaviors , which rather develop at a lower energy scale .",
    "when @xmath14 , rkky interaction suppresses the kondo scattering from the fermi energy up to the scale @xmath11 .",
    "the kondo renormalization is cutoff by @xmath11 before reaching @xmath3 .",
    "the imaginary parts of the uniform and staggered spin susceptibilities reach the maximum values at @xmath11 , but have a hump structure instead of the smooth crossover between the local moment to fl behaviors as in the kondo resonance state .",
    "while this hump is due to the singlet to triplet spin fluctuations between two impurity spins , it is broadened by the kondo scattering . in other words , impurities are still weakly coupled to the conduction electrons to form quasiparticles , i.e. , the coupling is @xmath10 rather than @xmath166 at the kondo fixed point .",
    "the spectral weight is still finite and reaches the maximum value at @xmath11 though it is small .",
    "@xmath16 is determined by @xmath11 in this limit , which can be understood as a cutoff effect on the kondo renormalization .",
    "when @xmath11 is comparable with @xmath3 , the kondo scattering and inter - impurity singlet to triplet excitation have comparable strengths .",
    "@xmath16 as the location for the maximum spin fluctuations lies in between @xmath3 and @xmath11 and increases when @xmath17 increases . in all these cases , we find that @xmath16 serves as the scale where the physical properties begin to be strongly influenced by the formation of quasiparticles .",
    "therefore , we can associate @xmath16 to the coherence scale for two coupled impurities .",
    "we notice that the properties of @xmath16 are in agreement with those of the coherence @xmath1 in heavy fermion systems .",
    "for instance , the changes in optical conductivities , the tunneling spectroscopy , and the hall effect are related to the change of the quasiparticle spectral weight while the magnetic responses and the scattering rate are affected by the strong spin fluctuations at this scale . as observed from the two - impurity model",
    ", the single - ion kondo temperature @xmath3 loses its manifestation in physical properties when @xmath167 .",
    "this is also true for heavy fermion systems . in experiments ,",
    "@xmath3 is determined by the dilute magnetic ions limit , as in ref .",
    "indeed , it is in general one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this implies that most heavy fermion compounds fall in the @xmath167 regime with magnetic orders developing at low temperatures . in this case",
    ", we find that @xmath16 is indeed determined by rkky interaction , which is consistent with the experimental analysis  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we notice that the quasiparticles at the scale @xmath11 are different from landau quasiparticles displaying fermi liquid behaviors : they rather are underscreened kondo excitations with non - fermi liquid behaviors",
    ". nevertheless , the dynamical measurements determining the coherence scale indeed are not necessary in the fermi liquid regime .",
    "besides , fermi liquid behaviors develop at a lower energy scale .",
    "we find that the fermi liquid parameters , such as @xmath168 $ ] , are also determined by @xmath11 . in this sense",
    ", the coherence scale indeed appears in the landau parameters , which are manifested also in static property measurements .",
    "this provides an explicit explanation to the scaling behavior of @xmath1 as rkky interaction rather than the single - ion kondo temperature , and it can be interpreted as a coherence scale .     for details of these two methods ) .",
    "the parameters taken are the same as in case ( i ) , or fig .",
    "[ fig : phsym ] . for both methods , the nrg iteration part is the same .",
    "a weight function @xmath169 is commonly chosen for the patching scheme .",
    "the spectral functions obtained by cfs - nrg method have high weights in the whole energy range .",
    "we explicitly verify the sum rule @xmath170 , and find the deviation in practice is less than @xmath171 . ]",
    "then the question is whether @xmath16 , the coherence scale for two anderson impurities , can be generalized to the heavy fermion lattice systems .",
    "this relies on an explicit calculation on the lattice models , for instance , solving the periodic anderson lattice model through a self - consistent two - impurity anderson model with the cluster dmft  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", one chooses the neighboring two sites of the lattice as a cluster and treat the lattice as the repetitions of this cluster .",
    "the even and odd parity states therefore correspond to the degrees of freedom at momentum ( 0,0,0 ) and ( @xmath172 ) , respectively , for a three dimensional lattice .",
    "once self - consistently solved , the two impurities have the same properties as the two sites in the lattice incorporating two - site correlations .",
    "although the self - consistency procedure hasnt been done explicitly , we argue that the generalization of the coherence scale can be valid .",
    "the most important result from our calculations is that the high energy properties above @xmath16 are governed by the single impurity physics .",
    "i.e. , the intersite coupling only modifies the low energy properties .",
    "this can be observed from the spectral functions [ cf .",
    "( 1)a and fig .",
    "3(a ) ] , which follow the universal single - ion kondo curve at high energies but their low energy weights are suppressed systematically from the scale @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath16 being rkky interaction , is a cutoff scale on the single - ion kondo renormalization .",
    "this statement , however , can not be made from the patching scheme calculations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : specomp ] , we show the spectral functions obtained from both cfs - nrg method and the patching scheme . while these methods may give the same positions for the characteristic energy scales , as the nrg iteration part is the same , the spectral function obtained by the patching scheme may lead to a different understanding on @xmath16 for @xmath14 .",
    "we observe enhanced quasiparticle excitations at @xmath173 compared with the single - ion case .",
    "this is due to the choice of the weight function between the overlapping energy range , which , commonly , favors the states in later iterations ( lower energies ) and exaggerates its weight .",
    "however , this may indicate that , due to rkky interaction @xmath11 , considerable spectral weight transfers from the incoherent part to the scale @xmath11 to form coherent excitations , rather the cutoff effect indicated by the cfs - nrg result .",
    "it is from the spectral functions that we determine the new weiss fields to recalculate the two - impurity problem . as the high energy part above @xmath16",
    "is determined by the single - ion kondo physics , it remains unchanged in the self - consistency procedure .",
    "the low energy part , however , is expected to be modified in the self - consistency procedure .",
    "but as @xmath11 is the cutoff scale , it does not involve any spectral weight transfer from the incoherent part , or more strictly , from part with energy higher than @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 remains as the high energy scale for the lattice .",
    "a caveat for this argument is not to violate the spectral sum rule .",
    "as seen from our calculation , the spectral weight of the low energy part only consists a negligible portion of the total spectral weight , for instance , valid for ce compounds .",
    "we notice that this argument may not hold for cases where the weight transfer between the incoherent part and coherent part is significant .",
    "in summary , we have studied the two - impurity anderson model with the complete - fock space numerical renormalization group method .",
    "we find that due to the competition between the kondo effect and rkky interaction which is the spin exchange interaction between two impurities , there are in general two energy scales present .",
    "the high energy scale characterizes the quasiparticle formations and the low energy scale specifies when these quasiparticles develop fermi liquid behaviors . in between",
    ", there exists an intermediate state with non - fermi liquid behaviors where both the kondo scattering and the excitations between the singlet and triplet configurations of the two impurity spins play equally important roles .",
    "the focus of our study is on the high energy scale which we associate with the coherence scale in heavy fermion systems . in the two - impurity model",
    ", it marks the scale with maximum spin fluctuations .",
    "while the spin fluctuations can be due to the kondo scattering with conduction electrons or the singlet to triplet excitations between the impurity spins , their relative strength is tuned by the ratio between rkky interaction and the kondo temperature .",
    "when the kondo effect wins , the high energy scale is determined by the kondo temperature , where quasiparticles begin to gain considerable weight .",
    "when rkky interaction dominates , the high energy scale is determined by rkky interaction , which can be understood as a cutoff on the kondo renormalization by a spin excitation gap .",
    "the quasiparticle spectral weight therefore reaches the maximum value at this scale . in both cases ,",
    "the high energy scale characterizes when the quasiparticles gain considerable weight to influence the physical properties .",
    "this is consistent with the definition of the coherence scale in heavy fermion systems .",
    "the most important result is that the physical properties above the high energy scales is determined by the single - ion kondo physics and is expected to remain unchanged in a cluster dmft procedure .",
    "this enables us to associate the high energy scale directly to the coherence scale of heavy fermion systems .",
    "besides sharing the same physical properties , they also have a same scaling behavior .",
    "when rkky interaction is much bigger than the single - ion kondo temperature , the coherence scale is determined by rkky interaction which is consistent with the experimental analysis  @xcite .",
    "this provides an explicit theoretical description for such an energy scale .    the low energy scale , as the fermi liquid temperature for quasiparticle , is expected to change in the cluster dmft self - consistent procedure .",
    "this prevents a direct connection between the two - impurity quantum phase transition to the magnetic quantum phase transition in heavy fermion systems .",
    "however , we expect both origins for the low energy scale in the two - impurity model will play important roles in determining the low energy scale(s ) in a lattice model .",
    "the degeneracy point between magnetic excitations and kondo scattering also exists in a lattice , for which doniach s criterion remains the same , i.e. , @xmath174 is of order unity .",
    "if the two - impurity critical dynamics drives a magnetic transition for the lattice , it will be interesting to check the existence of majorana fermion : many of its properties are in accordance with the local quantum critical behavior  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the two - impurity quantum critical point is unstable against certain forms of particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "for instance , the parity - splitting potential scattering term is always finite in case ( ii ) of our study , which is inherent to the heavy fermion lattices . in a lattice , this can be related to asymmetry between degrees of freedom at momentum ( 0,0,0 ) and ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "we have shown that it not only generates a finite fermi liquid temperature but also generates a finite spectral weight at the chemical potential [ cf .",
    "fig.[fig : phasym](a ) ] .",
    "the parity - splitting term also relates to a finite @xmath175 , which corresponds to a kinetic energy term for @xmath0-electrons  @xcite .",
    "this might help to stabilize a finite effective kondo scale .",
    "incidentally , as the potential scattering term scales as the kondo coupling , the associated ( low ) energy scale then also has the same scaling relation as rkky interaction .",
    "we expect that the two - impurity kondo physics will also help to understand the mott transition and unconventional superconductivity in other strongly correlated systems .",
    "the kondo physics has provided an elegant explanation to the mott transition in the single - site dmft approach to the hubbard model  @xcite . however , the intersite spin exchange interaction , similar to rkky interaction , is absent in the single - site approach .",
    "we learn from the two - impurity model that such an intersite interaction competes with the local kondo dynamics to modify the low energy properties .",
    "indeed a multi - site cluster dmft calculation shows different properties the metallic and insulating phases near the transition point  @xcite .",
