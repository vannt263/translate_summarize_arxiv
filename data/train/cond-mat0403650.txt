    "half - metallicity is the property of some spin polarised materials to exhibit a metallic density of states for one spin direction but a clear band gap around the fermi level @xmath0 for the other  @xcite .",
    "well known half metals are some heusler alloys  @xcite , the compound cro@xmath1",
    "@xcite , the manganite la@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath4  @xcite , magnetite ( fe@xmath4o@xmath5 ) @xcite or some diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite . in recent years",
    "technological interest in possible applications on spin - dependent transport has fueled the research in this field .",
    "for instance , ordered zinc - blende cras and crsb have been fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy , and experiment and calculations suggest half - metallicity @xcite .",
    "the high curie temperature @xmath6 ( over 400  k in experiment @xcite and in theory @xcite ) makes these compounds attractive also for applications .",
    "cras / gaas @xcite and crsb / gaas @xcite multilayers have been also realised , showing that coherent heterostructures are possible .",
    "such zinc - blende compounds of transition elements with group - v and vi atoms ( called pnictides and chalcogenides ) have been also studied by _",
    "ab - initio _ methods . calculations of the total energy and structural optimisation agree with the experimental result that the ground state structure of such compounds is not the zinc - blende , but in most cases the nias structure @xcite  rather more complicated and certainly not half - metallic @xcite .",
    "the zinc - blende structure can only be achieved by epitaxial growth on semiconductors for a few monolayers .",
    "heterostructures of half - metals with semiconductors are technologically interesting , since in principle they can be used to achieve spin injection from the ferromagnetic electrode to the semiconductor with 100 %  spin polarised current , a very useful quality for potential application in spin transistors @xcite .    until now , among the high-@xmath6 half - metals , heterostructures of heusler alloys with semiconductors have been found to suffer from interface states within the half - metallic gap @xcite , which can strongly reduce the spin polarisation of the current . on the other hand , zinc - blende half - metals follow the structure and the bonding of the zinc - blende semiconductors in a more coherent way , and thus one can expect to avoid spurious interface states .",
    "motivated by these ideas , we investigate in this paper the half - metal / semiconductor ( hm / sc ) contact for the zinc - blende materials and see under which conditions half - metallicity is preserved ; moreover , we investigate the magnetic moments at the interface .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] we give a few details on our calculations . in section  [ sec : bulk ] we shortly review the bulk properties of these half - metallic compounds , and address the effect of lattice distortion by tetragonalisation . in section  [ sec : multilayers ] we present calculations on hm / sc multilayers in ideal geometry and epitaxy and see in which cases half - metallicity is preserved . in section  [ sec : interface ]",
    "we examine interdiffusion effects at the interface and in section  [ sec : moments ] we discuss the spin magnetic moments at the interface .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "our calculations are based on density - functional theory within the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation potential , with the vosko , wilk and nusair parameterisation @xcite .",
    "we employ the full - potential screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green function method @xcite , where the correct shape of the wigner - seitz cells is taken @xcite . for the calculation of the charge and spin density",
    "we integrate along a contour on the complex energy plane , which extends from below the valence @xmath7 states of the @xmath8 atom up to the fermi level , using 42 energy points ; the lower states are treated as atomic core states . for the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration",
    "we have used a @xmath9-space grid of 30@xmath1030@xmath1030 in the full bz for the bulk calculations and a @xmath11-space grid 20@xmath1020 in the two - dimensional full bz for the interface calculations .",
    "we have used a cutoff of @xmath12=3 for the wavefuctions and green functions .",
    "more details are given in reference  @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed within the scalar relativistic approximation , which accounts for relativistic effects other than the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the effect of the latter on the half - metallic property is quite small for cras and crsb , as shown in reference  @xcite ( the reduction of the spin polarisation at the fermi level is of the order of 0.5% for cras and 1.5% for crsb ) .    finally , throughout the paper we have used the experimental lattice parameters for the semiconductors ( see references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the bulk properties of zinc - blende half - metals have been discussed in many papers in the past @xcite . here",
    "we will summarise what is already known , and use this as a step towards the understanding of the bulk properties under tetragonal distortion and of the interface properties .",
    "in the zinc - blende structure every atom has tetrahedral coordination , with its first neighbours being of the other atomic species .",
    "this symmetry splits the @xmath13 states of the transition - metal element ( tm ) in two subspaces : the @xmath14 with 3-fold degeneracy ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 orbitals ) and the @xmath18 with 2-fold degeneracy ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 states of the tm hybridise with the @xmath21 states of the neighbouring @xmath8 atom ( group v or vi ) , forming hybrids of bonding ( lower in energy ) and antibonding ( higher ) nature .",
    "this hybridisation and bonding - antibonding splitting is crucial for the formation of the gap in these compounds , and it is a characteristic of the tetrahedral coordination  in the hexagonal coordination of the energetically more stable nias structure , for instance , it is not present .",
    "the effect is already known as `` @xmath21-@xmath13 repulsion '' in tm impurities in zinc - blende semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the hybrids form wide bands , which retain the bonding - antibonding character and are therefore accordingly separated in energy . on the other hand , the @xmath18 orbitals are practically non - bonding and form narrow bands , which remain energetically between the bonding and antibonding @xmath14 states , separated from both . meanwhile , the @xmath7 states of the tm are still higher in energy , pretty much like the @xmath7 state of the ga atom in gaas stays above @xmath0 . only in cases of heavy @xmath8 anions , which have reduced ionicity ,",
    "do these @xmath7 states come closer to @xmath0 but still stay above it for minority spin ",
    "see for instance a recent study on mnbi @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 states of the @xmath8 anion , on the other hand , are anyhow very low , lower than the bonding @xmath21-@xmath13 hybrids .",
    "this energetical separation already creates a band gap , and is assisted strongly by the exchange splitting due to spin magnetism .",
    "thus , after the low - lying bonding bands are filled , the @xmath18 bands of only majority spin are progressively filled , while the corresponding minority bands are pushed higher above @xmath0 by the exchange splitting .",
    "as we change the valence of the tm atom toward the right in the periodic table , more majority bands are filled ; the magnetic moment increases ; thus the exchange splitting also increases keeping the minority @xmath18 states high in energy . in this way",
    "@xmath0 remains between the well - separated bonding bands and the @xmath18 bands , within a band gap . as a typical example we present the band structure of crsb in figure  [ fig:1 ] ( left ) for energies around the gap .",
    "the situation described above changes when the lattice is compressed .",
    "then the extended majority spin states of @xmath21 character feel the volume reduction and push @xmath0 higher , so that in the end @xmath0 enters the minority spin conduction band .",
    "after this point , although the gap still exists , it is below @xmath0 and half - metallicity is lost .",
    "therefore it is necessary to identify which compounds are half - metallic in their equilibrium lattice parameter , and of course on which semiconductors they might grow . in reference",
    "@xcite we have identified such systems , and we summarise the most important results here in table  [ table:1 ] .      when a zinc - blende half - metallic compound is grown on a semiconductor substrate ( say on ( 001 ) ) , its lattice will be tetragonally distorted so that it can assume the in - plane lattice constant of the sc while approximately keeping its own atomic volume . if the lattice match is good enough , the distortion will be minimal , and the electronic structure will change only slightly . here",
    "we shall investigate this effect for the case of reasonable hm / sc lattice matching , in order to show that half - metallicity is not destroyed by moderate tetragonalisation .    as a model system for the discussion we choose crsb , which we assume to be deposited on znte ( 001 ) and to have taken the corresponding in - plane lattice parameter of the semiconductor a@xmath22=6.1   and otherwise to have kept the atomic volume .",
    "this gives a ratio @xmath23a=0.914 , where @xmath24 is the lattice parameter in the growth direction .",
    "the corresponding band structure is shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] ( right ) . comparing to the crsb bands in the ideal zinc - blende geometry ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ( left ) ) , we see that the threefold degeneracy of the @xmath14 states at @xmath25 has split up into two subspaces , one singly ( @xmath26-@xmath15 ) and one doubly degenerated ( @xmath27-@xmath16 and @xmath28-@xmath17 ) . also the @xmath18 representation at @xmath25 has split in its constituents , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this behavior is expected because the @xmath29 axis is now distinguished .",
    "evidently half - metallicity is preserved by this moderate distortion .",
    "such behavior is typical for all hm examined here .",
    "the tetragonalisation can have an effect on half - metallicity if @xmath0 is at the edge of the gap for the ideal structure .",
    "then mainly the extended @xmath21 states , feeling the lateral change , will push @xmath0 higher , similarly to the case of lattice compression ; ultimately , if the distortion is too large , half - metallicity can be destroyed .",
    "in particular , if @xmath30 the @xmath26 states are squeezed and move higher in energy , while if @xmath31 this happens to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 states .",
    "in a recent examination of possible combinations of the transition elements v , cr , and mn , with group - v and vi elements @xcite , we found that some of them are half - metallic at their equilibrium lattice constants , which fit also reasonably well to those of some semiconductors ( sc ) .",
    "here we examine the cases of cras / sc and crsb / sc ( 001 ) multilayers for which the lattice mismatch should be small , as can be seen from table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "note that within the lda the lattice constant is usually underestimated by up to 2 - 4% @xcite .",
    "thus , if one allows for such a small increase of the calculated values of table  [ table:1 ] for the hm lattice constants , plus a moderate adjustment due to lattice mismatch , one arrives at the hm / sc combinations examined here .",
    "we assume that the structures have the experimental sc lattice constant and that the ideal zinc - blende structure is kept throughout .",
    "the systems consist of 4 monolayers ( ml ) of hm followed by 4 ml of sc and periodically repeated , in accordance with the experimental result that only a few ml can exist within the periodically repeated supercell in the cras / gaas case @xcite . in the @xmath32001@xmath33 $ ] direction of growth",
    ", this corresponds to interchanging monoatomic layers : e.g. , for cras / gaas , we have a supercell of the form ... cr / as / cr / as / ga / as / ga / as ... . for test purposes we have performed calculations on 8ml hm/8ml sc , and seen that our conclusions remain unchanged .    our results on the the local dos ( ldos ) are presented in figure  [ fig:2 ] for cras / gaas ( left ) and for crsb / inas ( right ) . in the multilayers we see that half - metallicity is conserved throughout .",
    "this means that no interface states within the gap are formed for the minority spin at the hm / sc interface .",
    "this can be understood since the growth is coherent , so that the local environment of the interface cr atoms is not changed in cras / gaas ( this is also the case in cras / mnas multilayers ; see , e.g. , reference @xcite ) . in crsb",
    "/ inas each interface cr atom has two sb neighbours on the one side and two as neighbours on the other , but the minority gap remains , since the @xmath21-@xmath13 hybridisation and the bonding - antibonding splitting are still realised ( the difference between having an as neighbour instead of an sb one is that the @xmath21 states of the former are somewhat lower in energy )",
    ".    for the majority spin the local dos at @xmath0 decays within the sc layers . for a thick sc spacer",
    "it should vanish far from the interface , since the sc band gap is present and the dos comes from exponentially decaying metal - induced gap states .    the main difference between the cras / gaas multilayer and the crsb / inas one is the position of @xmath0 within the minority gap . in cras",
    "/ gaas , @xmath0 just touches the conduction band , while for crsb / inas it is lower , closer to the middle of the gap .",
    "this is a volume effect , clear also in the bulk cras case .",
    "the reduced lattice constant of cras / gaas compared to crsb / inas affects the position of the @xmath0 within cras : the @xmath21 electrons feel the reduced volume and shift towards higher energy , pushing also @xmath0 .",
    "next we present the multilayer crsb / znte . we can call this a `` mixed valence '' multilayer , because it combines a 3d / group - v hm with a ii / vi semiconductor .",
    "thus , the environment of the interface cr atom is highly anisotropic : on the one side it has two sb neighbours and on the other two te neighbours , the electronegativity of which is higher than sb .",
    "nevertheless , half - metallicity survives , since the @xmath21-@xmath13 repulsion creating the bonding - antibonding splitting is still there , ( although with different strength between cr - sb and cr - te ) , and the strong exchange splitting is of course also present .",
    "the half - metallic ldos is shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] ( left )",
    ".    however , there are two inequivalent ways to construct the multilayer , accounting for two different possible interfaces .",
    "the first is cr / sb / cr / te / zn / te / zn / te , which is the half metallic one presented in figure  [ fig:3 ] ( left ) , and the second is cr / sb / cr / sb / zn / te / zn / te , the difference being that here a sb / zn contact is present , i.e. , a iii - vi hybrid . in the latter case half - metallicity is destroyed , due to interface states which occur at the sb / zn interface at @xmath0 for the minority spin ldos .",
    "the corresponding ldos is shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] ( right ) , where the minority - spin interface states are formed at @xmath0 for the sb  ( 4 ) and te  ( 5 ) atoms .",
    "similarly , only the cr / te / cr / as / in / as / in / as stacking would retain half - metallicity in the case of a crte / inas system , since in the case of the cr / te / cr / te / in / as / in / as stacking an in / te interface is present .    closing this section , we note that in the case of interfaces of half - metallic heusler alloys with sc , the half - metallic gap is usually destroyed @xcite , e.g. from all the ( theoretically ) studied cases in reference @xcite only the nimnsb(111)/cds(111 ) interface retained the half - metallicity , and this only when the interface was between the sb and s atoms . here , on the contrary , the hm gap is , as a rule , present , since the nature of the bonding is continued coherently at the interface .",
    "up to now we have considered only the ideal interface , without interdiffusion . however , in an experiment one can imagine that some intermixing can occur , and the question of keeping half - metallicity is raised again . as before , this can be discussed in terms of the bonding character .",
    "consider , for instance , the cras / gaas ( 001 ) interface , with an intermixed crga monolayer ( i.e. , a layer sequence of ... cr / as / cr@xmath34ga@xmath34/as / ga/ ... ) , under the assumption that the tetrahedral cation - anion coordination is not severely distorted ( this is a necessary requirement in all considerations of half - metallicity in these materials ) .",
    "then , the first neighbours of each interface cr atom will be as atoms , and the same holds for the neighbours of the ga atoms",
    ". a cr - ga bond will not be present , since the closest distance between cr and ga atoms is the one of second neighbours .",
    "thus we expect the same bonding - antibonding scheme as before , so that the hm gap should remain .",
    "changes _ will _ occur , of course , for example due to the different electrostatic potential at the interface , since cr and ga gave different ionicity .",
    "thus @xmath0 can be shifted with respect to the ideal interface .    in order to investigate if the hm property is really preserved , we performed a calculation of such an intermixed interface , by constructing an in - plane supercell , double in size than the usual cell and containing one cr and one ga atom at the interface .",
    "the dos in the vicinity of @xmath0 is shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "evidently , the system is half - metallic .",
    "in the bulk hm , the total spin moment per unit cell is integer ( in @xmath35 ) , as follows from just noticing that , due to the gap at @xmath0 , the number of minority - spin electrons is an integer .",
    "this line of thinking leads to a simple `` rule of 8 '' @xcite connecting the total number of valence electrons @xmath36 of the unit cell and the total spin moment @xmath37 per unit cell : @xmath38 since one has a total of 8 electrons in the bonding @xmath21-@xmath13 bands and in the ( deeper - lying ) @xmath7 band of the @xmath8 element , and the remaining the electrons occupy only majority states and build up the magnetic moment .",
    "this `` rule of 8 '' is generally valid for the whole family of zinc - blende half - metallic compounds , expressing a slater - pauling behaviour ; similar rules hold also for the heusler alloys  @xcite or hm superlattices  @xcite . as regards to the distribution of the spin moment among the atoms , the @xmath8 element has an induced moment opposite to the one of the transition element ( thus for the local moment of the transition atom we have @xmath39 ) .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the local character of the occupied bonding-@xmath21-@xmath13 majority and minority bands ( majority are more @xmath13-like around the transition atom ; minority are more @xmath21-like around the @xmath8 atom ) .",
    "for details we refer to reference  @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the magnetic moments of the multilayers and interfaces .    since at the interface",
    "the translational symmetry is broken , the magnetic moment per transition atom is no longer obliged to be an integer , even if half - metallicity is preserved .",
    "this has been already observed in the case of ( 001 ) surfaces @xcite . in the case of a transition - atom - terminated interface with a sc ,",
    "the total moment per interface transition atom depends on the valency of its neighbours on each side . to understand this",
    ", it is convenient to consider the occupied bonding @xmath21-@xmath13 hybrids plus the low - lying @xmath7 states of the @xmath8 atom as a kind of `` reservoir '' which has space for @xmath40 electrons ( both spin directions are occupied ) , and to count the electrons which fill it up ; once the state reservoir is filled , the remaining electrons will occupy only majority - spin states ( @xmath18 and @xmath21-@xmath13 antibonding ) and build up the moment .",
    "every @xmath8 neighbour of the tm introduces thus 8 low - lying states , and at the same time @xmath41 valence electrons ; this adds up to a total of @xmath42 unfilled reservoir states , or holes , to absorb the tm electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "each one of these @xmath8 neighbours has a total of 4 neighbours itself , thus it contributes only @xmath43 of its states to the particular tm . adding these up , we find a modified `` rule of 8 '' , applicable for the total spin moment per interface or surface tm in zinc - blende half - metals provided that half - metallicity is preserved at the interface or the surface ( eq .  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is a special case of this ) : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the number of neighbours , which will be less than 4 in the case of a surface tm . as in the case of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , this simple rule applies only when half - metallicity is present .",
    "the moment @xmath46 found by this rule is not expected to be completely localised at the tm , but rather distributed among the tm and the surrounding sites .",
    "the situation is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig:5]a for the case of znte / crsb ( in the figure we do not discuss the @xmath7 states of the sb and te atoms , since they are energetically low - lying and already filled by two electrons ) . in the bulk , each sb neighbour of the cr atom gives 3/4 of an electron to the @xmath21-@xmath13 bond , so that the 4 sb neighbours give a total of 3 electrons per cr atom . at the znte / crsb interface",
    "the cr atom has two sb and two te neighbours .",
    "the sb ones give again 3/4 of an electron each , while the te give one electron each ( since they have one more valence electron ) .",
    "adding these up , we have a total of 3.5  @xmath47 donated by the @xmath8 atoms to partly fill the bonding states of the interface cr atom .",
    "since there are 6 such states , the remaining 2.5  @xmath47 are donated by the cr atom , while the magnetic moment is built up by the @xmath48 remaining electrons of cr , where @xmath49 is the valence of cr . as a result ,",
    "a half - integer moment of @xmath50 per interface cr atom occurs .",
    "in fact , this can not be strictly localised at the interface , but is distributed among the interface atoms and their neighbours .",
    "note that the above sum rules refer only to the total moments , but not to the local ones .",
    "for instance , table  [ table:2 ] gives the local spin moments for the half - metallic multilayers .",
    "in comparing cras / gaas ( total interface moment : 3 @xmath35 ) with crsb / znte ( total interface moment : 3.5 @xmath35 ) results we find that the local interface cr moment increases by about 0.45 @xmath35 and the other 0.05 @xmath35 is achieved by a reduction of the absolute value of the negative anion moments ; interface te atoms have a spin moment of around -0.06 @xmath35 compared to the -0.10 @xmath35 of the as interface atoms . in the case of the crsb / inas system",
    "the total interface moment should be 3 @xmath35 as for cras / gaas and the larger cr moment at the interface for the former system is compensated by the larger absolute values of the spin moments of the @xmath8 anions .",
    "the difference between the two systems arises mainly due to the larger electronegativity of as compared to sb .",
    "the as @xmath21 states are originally lower than the sb ones , so that the @xmath21-@xmath13 hybridisation is weaker , and the bonding states of majority spin are more localised around the as atom ; thus the absolute value of both cr and as moments is smaller .",
    "but it is also possible to obtain a value of @xmath51 or @xmath52 per cr atom .",
    "such an example is shown schematically in figure  [ fig:5]b , where we have substituted the pure sb layer at the interface by a sb@xmath34te@xmath34 intermixed layer .",
    "each cr atom at the interface has one sb and three te atoms as first neighbours , and gives away 2.25 electrons to the bonding states .",
    "thus @xmath53 electrons are left to build up the spin moment .",
    "similarly the cr atoms in the sub - interface layer have now three sb and one te atoms as first neighbours and a total spin moment of @xmath51 .    the above sum rule can be considered as a generalisation of the sum rule derived in reference @xcite for the surfaces . in the case of the cr - terminated cras(001 ) or crse(001 ) surfaces , the cr atom at the interface loses two of its four neighbours and its spin moment is increased by 1.5 @xmath35 in the case of the cras(001 ) surface and by 1.0 @xmath35 for the crse(001 ) surface .",
    "we have performed first - principles calculations of ( 001 ) multilayers of half - metallic zinc - blende compounds ( cras and crsb ) with iii - v and ii - vi semiconductors , focusing on the question whether half - metallicity is conserved at the interface .",
    "we have found that this can be the case under not too restrictive assumptions .    basically , the important requirement is that the coordination of the transition metal does not change at the interface : it should have four @xmath8 neighbours of anionic ( electronegative ) character , as in the bulk . then the bonding - antibonding splitting of the @xmath21-@xmath13 hybrides is retained and half - metallicity is conserved .",
    "it is not important that all four neighbours be of the same type .",
    "thus , even in the inas / crsb and znte / crsb interfaces one observes half - metallicity . for the same reason , the intermixed cr - ga interface is half - metallic , too . we have also found that a moderate tetragonalisation does not affect the half - metallic character of the materials , thus growth of these half - metals on semiconductors with slightly different lattice constant brings no problems .    we have also examined the magnetic moments at the interface .",
    "we have found that , in the case of an interface between a tm / group - v compound and a ii - vi semiconductor , the total spin magnetic moment at the interface has a non - integer value .",
    "based on simple arguments , applicable to any zinc - blende ferromagnetic surface or interface provided that half - metallicity is preserved , we have derived a sum rule ( eq .  [ eq:2 ] ) to calculate this spin moment .",
    "we conclude that zinc - blende half - metallic compounds combine various qualities desirable for spintronics applications : half - metallic ferromagnetism , high curie temperatures , coherent growth and half - metallic interfaces with semiconductors .",
    "we hope that our work is motivating for further experimental research in the field .",
