    "a kleinian group is said to be geometrically finite when the corresponding hyperbolic 3-orbifold has a convex core which has finite volume .",
    "it was conjectured by bers in @xcite that every b - group , i.e.  a kleinian group with a unique simply - connected invariant component in the domain of discontinuity , is an algebraic limit of quasi - fuchsian group .",
    "the conjecture was generalised by sullivan and thurston to the one saying that every finitely generated kleinian group is an algebraic limit of quasi - conformal deformations of a geometrically finite group .",
    "this generalised conjecture is called the bers - sullivan - thurston density conjecture today .",
    "the original conjecture of bers was solved by bromberg @xcite using deformations of cone manifolds and minsky s solution of the ending lamination conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds with bounded geometry in @xcite and @xcite which was prior to the solution of the general case .",
    "( a hyperbolic manifold is said to have bounded geometry if there is a positive lower bound for the lengths of the closed geodesics . )",
    "this result is then generalised to freely indecomposable kleinian groups in brock - bromberg @xcite . the purpose of the present paper is to prove this density conjecture in general , including the case of freely decomposable kleinian groups . before explaining what is the difficulty in the freely decomposable case , we shall review the ending lamination conjecture and its resolution , on which our proof of the main result depends .",
    "the ending lamination conjecture , which is due to thurston and has been one of the most famous conjectures in the modern kleinian group theory , says that every topologically tame hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold is determined up to isometries by its homeomorphism type and end invariants consisting of the conformal structures at infinity and the ending laminations . here",
    "a hyperbolic 3-manifold is said to be topologically tame when it is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold .",
    "we shall explain what the end invariants are more in details .",
    "let @xmath1 be a topologically tame hyperbolic 3-manifold , and @xmath2 its non - cuspidal part .",
    "we choose a compact core @xmath3 such that for each component @xmath4 of @xmath5 , the intersection @xmath6 is a core of @xmath4 , and each component of @xmath7 is a product open - interval bundle over a component of @xmath8 .",
    "we shall call such a compact core nice . for a nice compact core @xmath3",
    ", we see that @xmath9 has a structure of a pared manifold .",
    "each component of @xmath10 faces an end of @xmath2 .",
    "the ends of @xmath2 have invariants as follows .",
    "if an end of @xmath2 is geometrically finite , i.e.  has a neighbourhood containing no closed geodesics , then there is a component of the quotient @xmath11 of the region of the discontinuity which can be regarded as the points at infinity of the end , and its marked conformal structure constitutes an invariant for the end .",
    "when an end is geometrically infinite , it has an invariant called the ending lamination , which is represented by a measured lamination contained in the masur domain of the frontier component of @xmath3 facing the end , determined uniquely up to transverse measures if we fix a marking on the frontier component .",
    "( the marking of @xmath8 is not uniquely determined by the marking of @xmath12 when @xmath8 has a compressible component . )",
    "the ending lamination conjecture says that these pieces of information , the parabolic locus , the marked conformal structure for the geometrically finite ends and the ending laminations for the geometrically infinite ends both up to the action of the auto - diffeomorphisms of the frontier component homotopic to the identity in @xmath3 , together with the homeomorphism type , are sufficient to determine the isometry type of the hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold .",
    "the first essential contribution to solving the ending lamination conjecture was due to minsky @xcite , @xcite for hyperbolic 3-manifolds with freely indecomposable fundamental groups and bounded geometry . after some work on the unbounded geometry case in special situations as in minsky @xcite and @xcite , the conjecture for the general case when hyperbolic manifolds may have unbounded geometry was finally solved in minsky @xcite and brock - canary - minsky @xcite based on the work on the geometry of the curve complex developed in masur - minsky @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although brock - canary - minsky @xcite only contains a proof for freely indecomposable case , it can be generalised to freely decomposable case , as was written in the first section of @xcite , using the technique of constructing negatively curved metric on branched covers due to canary @xcite .",
    "this method in the case of manifolds with bounded geometry corresponding to @xcite was explained in @xcite and its generalisation to the case of manifolds having the same end invariants as those with bounded geometry , corresponding to @xcite , was sketched in ohshika - miyachi @xcite .    for the bers - sullivan - thurston density conjecture in the freely decomposable case",
    ", it is first necessary to show that every finitely generated kleinian group is topologically tame so that ending laminations can be defined .",
    "this is exactly what marden s tameness conjecture says , which was recently solved by agol and calegari - gabai independently ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "once marden s conjecture is solved , to show that every ( finitely generated and torsion - free ) kleinian group is a limit of quasi - conformal deformations of a geometrically finite group , using the resolution of the ending lamination conjecture by brock - canary - minsky , what we need to do is to prove that any possible system of a homomorphism type , a parabolic locus , and end invariants can be realised in a kleinian group which is a limit of minimally parabolic geometrically finite groups . in the case of",
    "freely decomposable groups , this consists of two main steps .",
    "the first step is to provide a convergence theorem for freely decomposable group generalising results of kleineidam - souto @xcite , lecuire @xcite and ohshika @xcite , in the last of which we only dealt with kleinian groups without parabolic elements .",
    "the second step is to show that the limit group obtained by the convergence theorem has the desired properties .",
    "this in particular necessitates to show that the support of an arational measured lamination contained in the masur domain , which we know to be unrealisable , is homotopic in @xmath12 to an ending lamination .",
    "this latter step was easy for the freely indecomposable case by work of thurston and bonahon , but in our general case , the argument is rather complicated .",
    "we note that namazi and souto also have also given a proof of this latter step in @xcite , and have proved the bers - sullivan - thurston density conjecture independently of our work .",
    "we now state in the form of a theorem an affirmative solution of the bers - sullivan - thurston density conjecture for general ( topologically tame ) kleinian groups as explained above .",
    "let @xmath13 be a finitely generated , torsion - free kleinian group .",
    "then there is a geometrically finite kleinian group @xmath14 without infinite cyclic maximal parabolic subgroups such that @xmath13 is an algebraic limit of quasi - conformal deformations of @xmath14 .",
    "kleinian groups without infinite cyclic parabolic groups are sometimes called minimally parabolic , as in our title .",
    "it should be noted that minimally parabolic geometrically finite groups are convex cocompact unless they have rank-@xmath15 abelian subgroups .",
    "this theorem is derived as a corollary from the main theorem of the present paper , which we shall state below , combined with the solution of the ending lamination conjecture and thurston s uniformisation theorem for compact atoroidal @xmath0-manifolds with boundary ( see for instance @xcite ) . before stating the theorem formally , we summarise what the theorem says .",

    "then what we shall claim in the theorem is that there is a topologically tame kleinian group @xmath13 which is an algebraic limit of quasi - conformal deformations of @xmath14 such that @xmath21 has @xmath18 as the parabolic locus and the given conformal structures and laminations as end invariants under the natural marking .",

    "when @xmath19 is a trivial @xmath32-bundle ( as a pared manifold ) and @xmath27 , we further assume that the supports of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not homotopic in @xmath3 .",

    "we should note that this theorem can be also regarded as a generalisation of the main theorem of ohshika @xcite , where we generalised maskit s theorem in @xcite on function groups to one on general geometrically finite groups .",

    "the first of the two main steps is to show that such a sequence of quasi - conformal structures converges algebraically after passing to a subsequence .",
    "the proof of this fact relies on work of otal @xcite , kleineidam - souto @xcite and a more recent result of lecuire @xcite on the extension of the masur domain .",
    "the second main step is to show that the limit group has properties as we wanted .",
    "it follows from results in ohshika @xcite , brock - souto @xcite ( or the general solution of marden s conjecture ) that the limit @xmath13 is topologically tame , and using some geometric argument , we can show that the @xmath31 can not be realised there .",
    "a most difficult part of the second step is to show that ( the images by a homeomorphism from @xmath51 to @xmath52 of ) the @xmath31 actually represent ending laminations .",
    "( proposition [ ending lamination ] . )",
    "section 6 will be entirely devoted to the proof of this fact .",
    "throughout this paper , kleinian groups are assumed to be finitely generated and torsion free except for the case when we consider geometric limits , which may be infinitely generated .",
