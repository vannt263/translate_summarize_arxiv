    "we find that increasing the value of local magnetic moment a given amount of electronic charge is moved from fe to o ions ( see fig .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we find that the magneto - electric coupling is further enhanced by inclusion of ionic relaxations .",
    "this clearly suggests that the ferroelectric displacements are controlled by the local magnetization of fe sites .",
