    "room - temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) have become an extensively investigated topic in recent years .",
    "rtils are salts with melting points at about room temperature , in contrast to inorganic salts such as @xmath0 with a melting point of @xmath1 @xcite . the first report of an rtil is dated to 1914 , when the compound ethylammonium nitrate with a melting temperature of @xmath2 was synthesized @xcite . since the 1990s interest in rtils has grown greatly due to the discovery of a huge number of air- and water - stable compounds ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "besides the strikingly low melting point , rtils exhibit a number of remarkable general , i.e. , material - independent , physical properties such as an extremely low vapour pressure @xcite and a high viscosity at ambient temperature  the lowest viscosity of rtils at @xmath3 observed by now , @xmath4 for @xmath5[n(cn)_2]}$ ] @xcite , is more than twenty times that of water .",
    "all these properties are related to the combination of strong electrostatic and highly anisotropic steric forces",
    ".    an interesting feature of the rtils for applications is the high sensitivity of some physical properties on the choice of the cation and the anion .",
    "for example the viscosity of @xmath6[bf_4]}$ ] is only half of that of @xmath6[pf_6]}$ ] even though these rtils differ only in the size of the ( spherical ) anions @xcite .",
    "therefore exploration of rtils on the molecular level is crucial , in order to being able to `` design '' salts with prescribed properties .",
    "computer simulations are frequently used as a tool , but the challenge is to find an adequate description of the interaction potentials .",
    "such interaction potentials are complicated and depend upon many parameters ( e.g. , bond , angle and torsion parameters as well as van der waals terms @xcite ) . however , the aim of the present work is not to model a specific rtil with all its peculiarities but to investigate ionic fluids , i.e. , rtils and fused salts , from a general point of view which considers them mostly as fluids being composed of ions at high densities .",
    "hence , since general features are expected to occur in all systems , one can focus on the simple system of equally - sized charged hard spheres , which is commonly called the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) .    as rtils are used as solvents in chemical studies ,",
    "their polarity is one of the most important characteristics because it describes the global solvation capability of the solvent . in order to interpret surface force apparatus ( sfa ) measurements ,",
    "it has been proposed recently @xcite to view pure ionic liquids as dilute electrolyte solutions with a few mobile ions in an effective solvent made of temporarily paired ions . whereas these sfa data have been doubted @xcite , the interpretation of rtils as dilute electrolyte solutions",
    "has attracted some interest @xcite . for non - conducting fluids the static dielectric constant @xmath7",
    "is well defined and precisely measurable ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , conducting fluids , such as ionic fluids , are well - known to perfectly screen external charges at _ long _ ranges @xcite so that the corresponding static dielectric constant is infinitely large . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also well - known that cations and anions form a characteristic alternating pair structure at _ short _ ranges @xcite , which , when considering neighboring cation - anion pairs , is analogous to the charge separation inside dipolar molecules .",
    "therefore , it appears that the dielectric properties of dense ionic fluids depend on the length scale .    in the present work",
    "the analysis is based on the response of bulk ionic fluids to a static nonuniform electric field which spatially varies on a particular length scale .",
    "it has to be stressed that here the focus is on nonuniform static electric fields , the response onto which is described in terms of the wavenumber - dependent dielectric function @xmath8 , whereas numerous experimental studies consider uniform time - dependent fields , which give rise to the frequency - dependent dielectric function @xmath9 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both quantities , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are not easily related because the former describes the equilibrium structure whereas the latter quantifies the dynamics in uniform electric fields .",
    "the dielectric properties of a substance can be interpreted in terms of two well - known mechanisms @xcite : orientation polarization refers to the rotation of dipolar moments upon keeping the magnitude constant , whereas distortion polarization describes the change of magnitude of dipolar moments at constant orientations .",
    "the according orientation susceptibility @xmath10 and distortion susceptibility @xmath11 both contribute to the total electric susceptibility @xmath12 .",
    "however , in order to infer the dominant polarization mechanism as a function of the wave number @xmath13 , one has to somehow determine the decomposition of the observable @xmath14 into the orientation and the distortion contribution .",
    "perfect screening in ionic fluids and the according divergence @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 @xcite corresponds to a dominating distortion polarization in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "this long - range behavior of ionic fluids is in sharp contrast to that of dipolar fluids , whose electric susceptibility @xmath17 attains a finite limit @xmath18 as @xmath16 .    in order to achieve the decomposition of the electric susceptibility @xmath17 of an ionic fluid into the orientation and the distortion susceptibility @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "respectively , the following approach is proposed : in addition to determine the electric susceptibility @xmath17 of the ionic fluid composed of cations and anions , a corresponding dipolar fluid is considered whose particles are overall charge - neutral dumbbells formed by gluing together pairs of cations and anions of the ionic fluid .",
    "this dipolar fluid does not exhibit distortion polarization , i.e. , @xmath19 , but only pure orientation polarization , i.e. , @xmath20 , and the latter can be expected to be similar to @xmath10 of the corresponding ionic fluid at short ranges . the applicability of this approach is not restricted to the rpm investigated here but it can be used for any ionic fluid model .    a brief description of the theoretical methods as well as the considered models is given in sec .",

    "the results of actual calculations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : 3 ] from which general conclusions on the dielectric properties of ionic fluids are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : 4 ] .",
    "the model used to represent the ionic fluid is the three - dimensional restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , i.e. , a collection of @xmath21 positively and @xmath21 negatively charged hard spheres of equal diameter @xmath22 and equal absolute valencies @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : 1](a ) ) .",
    "the interaction potential between two ions of species @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 at positions",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , can be described as @xmath29 with the vacuum bjerrum length @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the elemenatry charge , @xmath32 denotes the inverse temperature , and @xmath33 is the vacuum permittivity .    in this work , the dielectric properties of the rpm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : 1](a ) ) are compared with those of a corresponding dipolar fluid model whose particles are composed of one cation and one anion of the rpm glued together ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : 1](b ) ) .",
    "the particles within this dumbbell model ( dm ) possess three positional and two orientational degrees of freedom , in contrast to six translational degrees of freedom of a pair of ions within the rpm .",
    "obviously , all configurations of @xmath21 dumbbells correspond to possible configurations of the rpm with @xmath21 positive and @xmath21 negative hard spheres , but not all configurations of the rpm can be realized within the dm .",
    "the interaction energy between two dumbbell particles is given by the sum of contributions eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsilpotential ] ) of the constituent charged hard spheres .      in this work",
    "the dielectric properties of ionic and dipolar fluids are studied by analyzing the linear response of the models introduced in the previous subsec .",

    "the dielectric properties are given by the dielectric function tensor @xmath34 or , equivalently , by the electric susceptibility tensor @xmath35 .",
    "however , since electrostatic fields are purely longitudinal due to faraday s law , the polarization field is also purely longitudinal in isotropic fluids .",
    "therefore , only the longitudinal components ( parallel to the wave vector @xmath36 ) @xmath37 are of relevance here .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the longitudinal dielectric function @xmath38 is related to the charge - charge structure factor @xmath39 via @xmath40 in the present work the averaging in eq .",
    "( [ eq : szz ] ) is obtained by means of grandcanonical monte carlo simulations of the rpm and the dm .      in order to determine the charge - charge structure factor @xmath41 in eq .",

    "quick simulation runs were used to determine the relation between the chemical potential and the mean density @xmath43 for fixed temperature . for calculation of the charge - charge structure factor @xmath41",
    "typically @xmath44 relaxation and @xmath45 evaluation steps were used .",
    "a monte carlo step involved a random selection of one of the following possible moves :    * translation of an ion ( rpm ) or of a dumbbell ( dm ) inside a small cube - like environment of size @xmath46 with probability @xmath47 , * insertion of a cation and an anion ( rpm ) or of a dumbbell ( dm ) with probability @xmath48 , or * removal of a cation and an anion ( rpm ) or of a dumbbell ( dm ) with probability @xmath48 .",
    "insertions and removals of charge - neutral entities guarantee global charge neutrality during the whole simulation .",
    "values of @xmath47 and @xmath49 were chosen in the way that the resulting rate of acceptance of the trial states did not drop below @xmath50 .",
