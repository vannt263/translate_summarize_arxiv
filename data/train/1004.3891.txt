    "( 1996 ) and murakami et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that the 6.4  kev emission from the neutral clumps is due to the k - shell ionization of iron atoms by external x - rays , possibly from the super - massive black hole , sgr  a * ( an x - ray reflection nebula ; xrn ) . although the present x - ray luminosity of sgr  a * is @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath3 ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) , the luminosity required for the 6.4  kev emission is @xmath7  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath3 . therefore , sgr  a * in a few hundred years ago would have been @xmath8 times brighter than now ( e. g. koyama et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand , yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 2007 ) proposed that the origin of the 6.4  kev emission would be low energy cosmic - ray electrons ( @xmath910100  kev ) , because they found that the x - rays correlated with non - thermal radio filaments .",
    "neutral atoms of lighter elements , such as ar and ca , should also exist in the neutral clumps , and hence would emit k - shell emission lines .",
    "these would provide new information to constrain the origin of the neutral clumps in the gc region .",

    "we re - analyzed the x - ray data obtained with the x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis ; koyama et al .",

    "the size of the field of view is @xmath12 and the half - power diameter is @xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "xis2 has been out of use since 2006 november , hence we did not use the xis2 data on the 2007 september .    the xis was working with the normal clocking and the full - window mode during all observations .",
    "the xis pulse - height data for each x - ray event were converted to pulse invariant ( pi ) channels using the xispi software version 2008 - 04 - 10 , and the calibration database version 2008 - 08 - 25 .",

    "the cor - sorted nxb was subtracted from the raw data with the same cor .    since the relative gain of the fi sensors",

    "( 80mm,50mm)figure1.eps    in order to depict a neutral clump from the gc region , we made an x - ray image in the 6.4  kev line by the following procedures .",
    "we first made x - ray images in the 56 kev and in the 6.36.5 kev bands , after subtracting the nxb and correcting the vignetting effect .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectrum from a 8@xmath18 circular region near the field center , and fitted the 56 kev band spectrum with a power - law model .",
    "the best - fit photon index in the 5.06.0  kev band is @xmath19 .",
    "the ratio of the photon flux in the 6.36.5  kev band to that in the 5.06.0  kev band was estimated to be 0.165 , by extrapolation of the power - law index .",
    "we multiplied the 5.06.0  kev band image by 0.165 , and subtracted from the 6.36.5  kev band image .",
    "the result is shown in figure  1 .",
    "we can see a bright region near the center of the 6.4  kev line image , as is shown with the solid line of a gourd - like shape ( hereafter , the source region ) . around the source region",

    "the x - ray emission from the gc hot plasma contributes to the spectrum of the source region . in order to examine the contribution of the gc hot plasma accurately , we selected the dashed region , excluding the supernova remnant , sgr a east @xcite , whose size and position are @xmath20 and ( @xmath10 , @xmath11)@xmath1 ( , ) .",
    "hereafter , we call this region as reference",
    ".      the nominal uncertainty of the absolute energy of xis is @xmath21  ev ( the suzaku xis team ) . to be more accurate , we checked the energy of the k@xmath0 lines of h - like s ( s ) of the spectra and the calibration source @xmath22fe ( emits the mn  k@xmath0 line at 5895  ev ) attached at the corner of the xis . compared with the theoretical value obtained from atomic & molecular database in the institute of applied physics and computational mathematics ( camdb )",
    ", we found that the energy differences of s k@xmath0 and mn k@xmath0 were @xmath23 and @xmath24  ev for fi , while those for bi were consistent with the theoretical energies .",

    "( 80mm,50mm)figure2.eps    figure  2 shows the x - ray spectra of the fi sensor in the source and reference regions .",
    "the spectra have several ionized emission lines of heavy elements , such as si , s , ar , ca , and fe .",

    "( 150mm,100mm)figure3.eps    the x - ray spectra of the two regions ( source and reference ) would be a complex of the gc hot plasma and the neutral clumps @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , made a fitting model composed of the gc hot plasma ( here @xmath30 ) , the neutral clumps ( hear @xmath31 ) and the cosmic x - ray background ( here @xmath32 ) .",

    "@xcite found that the gc hot plasma ( @xmath30 ) has two - temperature components , and hence the @xmath30 model can be described as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are thin thermal plasma code in the xspec package for the low ( @xmath38 ) and high ( @xmath39 ) temperature components , respectively .",

    "neutral lines are expressed by gaussians , while the continuum is represented by a power - law model with the photon index @xmath42 and the normalization @xmath43 .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) flux is lower than the whole spectra shown in figure  2 by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "we nevertheless add the cxb model made by @xcite , @xmath44 where absorption column density ( @xmath34 ) is applied twice because the origin of the cxb is extragalactic .",
    "since the surface brightness of @xmath30 is not constant , the spectrum of @xmath31 can not be directly obtained by the subtracting the surrounding ( reference ) region .",
    "we therefore tried to simultaneous fit these two regions and to determine the spectra of the @xmath31 and @xmath30 models , separately .",
    "the x - ray photons below @xmath12 kev from the gc region are heavily absorbed by an inter - stellar medium of @xmath45  @xmath3 , and the x - ray spectrum below @xmath12 kev is dominated by the local background @xcite .",
    "we therefore used only the 210  kev band for the spectral analysis .    in the fitting of @xmath30",
    ", we assumed that the temperatures ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and elemental abundances ( @xmath46 ) of si , s , fe , and ni were common in the two regions ( source and reference ) .",
    "abundances of ar and ca were set to be the same as that of s. also , @xmath34 was treated to be common in the two regions . on the other hand",
    ", we set the normalizations of the hot plasma ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) to be independent free parameters .    for @xmath31 ,",
    "common free parameters among the two regions are the power - law index ( @xmath42 ) , the equivalent widths of the neutral lines to the continuum , and line center energies .",
    "the normalization of the power - law ( @xmath43 ) is an independent free parameter . with these constraints",
    ", we proceeded the model fitting with equation ( 2 ) along the following 3 steps :         for the @xmath31 model of equation 4 , we first tried a fitting with three gaussians for fe  k@xmath0 ( 6.40  kev ) , fe  k@xmath47 ( 7.06  kev ) , and ni  k@xmath0 ( 7.49  kev ) lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this fit left many residuals , including that at @xmath48  kev .",
    "the energy is near the m - edge of au ( 3.23.4  kev ) , and hence the residuals are likely due to the calibration uncertainty of the response of the xrt .",
    "in fact , similar residuals were reported by @xcite . we , thus , added a broad gaussian line at @xmath49  kev according to @xcite .",
    "the best - fit center energy and the line width ( 1 sigma ) of the gaussian are @xmath50  kev and @xmath51  kev , respectively .",
    "the fitting residuals are displayed simply for the fi spectra of the source region in figure  3b , although the fitting was made simultaneously for the both sensors ( fi and bi ) and both the two regions .",
    "as shown in figure  3b , this model was not able to reproduce the observed spectra ( @xmath52/d.o.f is 1447/906 ) .",
    "one reason of the unacceptable fit is that the apec model does not contain cr and mn k - lines at 56  kev .",
    "we therefore added two gaussian lines in the @xmath30 model of equation ( 3 ) at @xmath53 and 6.2  kev for the cr and mn k@xmath0 lines , then , the center energies were obtained to be @xmath54 and @xmath55  kev , respectively . these are consistent with theoretical energies of @xmath56 and @xmath57  kev ( camdb ) , the he - like cr ( cr ) and mn ( mn )",
    ".    the hot plasma can also emit k@xmath0 lines of h - like cr ( cr ) and mn ( mn ) at 5.94  kev and 6.44  kev , respectively . using the two - apec model with the temperatures of 1 kev and 7kev and the flux ratios given in table  [ fit_result ]",
    ", we plotted the intensity ratio of h - like to he - like k@xmath0 lines as a function of atomic number ( ar , ca , fe ) in figure  [ fig : lineratio ] . by interpolation , we estimated the line intensity ratios of cr and mn to be 0.22 and 0.28 .",
    "we added these four lines in the @xmath30 model : @xmath58 where the intensity ratios of h - like to he - like cr and mn were fixed to be 0.22 and 0.28 .",
    "we also set the equivalent widths of cr  k@xmath0 and mn  k@xmath0 to the continuum of the @xmath30 model to be the same in the two regions .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure4.eps    this fitting gave @xmath52/d.o.f . of 1367/902 .",
    "the residuals from this model in the source spectrum are shown in figure  3c . in the next step ( step 3 ) , we used the @xmath30 model of equation ( 6 )",
    ".         since we still found line - like residuals at the energies of @xmath13.0 , 3.7 , 5.4 , and 5.9  kev , we added four gaussian lines to the @xmath31 model of equation ( 4 ) at these energies ( in figure  3c , also see dashed lines in figure  3 ) .",
    "then the line energies were found to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62  kev , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to theoretical energies of 2.96 , 3.69 , 5.41 , and 5.90  kev for the k@xmath0 lines of ar , ca , cr , and mn .",
    "the fitting residuals in the spectrum of the source region are shown in figure  3d .    as demonstrated in figure  3d , the @xmath52/d.o.f .",
    "is largely improved from 1367/902 ( step 2 ) to 1203/894 ( step 3 ) , but is not acceptable even at the 99% confidence level .",
    "although the energy resolution in the hard x - ray band is well calibrated with the calibration source @xmath22fe ( emits the mn  k@xmath0 line ) , that in the soft band , especially about 2  kev , may have some uncertainty due to the absence of available calibration sources .",
    "thus the deviation at @xmath12.5  kev would come from the incomplete response function in the soft energy band .",
    "residuals are also found at @xmath16.57.0  kev , with a slight mismatch of the center energy of fe  k@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the gc hot plasma has more than two temperature components .",
    "we therefore tried a fitting with a three-@xmath63 plasma model . although the fit was improved from @xmath52/d.o.f.@xmath641203/894 to 1123/891 , the best - fit parameters for the @xmath31 and @xmath30 models do not change from those in the two-@xmath63 model within the statistical errors .",
    "we , thus , regard that the two-@xmath63 model after step 3 is a good approximation to derive the physical parameters .    for the discussion on the neutral clump in the source region , we list the best - fit parameters for the @xmath30 model in table  [ fit_result ] , while those for the @xmath31 model are listed in table  [ result_neutral ] . for comparison ,",

    "<S> the k - shell emission line of neutral irons from the galactic center ( gc ) region is one of the key for the structure and activity of the gc . </S>",

    "<S> , we analyzed the suzaku x - ray spectrum from the gc region of intense neutral iron line emission , and report on the discovery of k@xmath0 lines of neutral argon , calcium , chrome , and manganese atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent widths of these k@xmath0 lines indicate that the metal abundances in the gc region should be @xmath11.6 and @xmath14 of solar value , depending on the x - ray and the electron origins , respectively . on the other hand , the metal abundances in the hot plasma in the gc region </S>",

    "<S> these results favor that the origin of the neutral k@xmath0 lines are due to x - ray irradiation . </S>"
