    "young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the early phase of star formation continuously aggregates material from parent dense molecular cores .",
    "this process seems to be followed by the formation of disk and outflows , and protostars come into existence by dispersing debris around them ( @xcite )",
    ". this scenario is generally accepted at least for low mass stars . the classification or evolutionary sequence of ysos from class 0 to iii , mainly based on their spectral energy distribution , has been established and became a framework to which subsequent studies should refer ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , one needs to find direct observational evidence of inward motion leading to a drastic density enhancement of central source which is prerequisite for the star formation .",
    "the method of diagnosing the collapse motion had been developed earlier ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but it was first detected only in the 1990 s ( @xcite ) .",
    "the method is based on the idea that , in the presence of the infall motion of which magnitude is not so large as that of intrinsic ( turbulent + thermal ) motion , an opaque line has a self - absorption with the blue peak stronger than the red one , while an optically thin line with a single peak is located between the two peaks of the opaque line . since class 0 and",
    "i objects are believed to be in main accretion phase , prompt attention is paid to them in an attempt to understand the earliest phase of star forming process . many class 0 and i sources",
    "have been surveyed initially with single dish telescopes mainly for the detection of infall signatures , resulting in a statistical preference for inward motion rather than outward one for these objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys also served as a basis for detailed studies of higher angular resolution .",
    "imaging with high spatial resolution is particularly important since the star formation process takes place at a smaller scale .",
    "only interferometric observations enable us to separate envelopes , disks , and outflow lobes and to disentangle motions associated with them .",
    "choi et al . ( 1999 ) carried out a survey of 9 class 0 sources using the berkeley - illinois - maryland - association ( bima ) interferometer , and hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the ysos in the serpens molecular cloud .",
    "detailed investigation has been undertaken for a limited number of ysos as well ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . eventually all ysos will have to be observed with interferometers in a variety of transitions .    as a step toward these high resolution studies",
    ", we conducted an interferometric observation of l483 .",
    "the l483 is one of the so - called myers cores containing an embedded infrared source , iras 18148 - 0440 , at a distance of 200 pc .",
    "its size is @xmath12 from the observations of hc@xmath0n ( @xcite ) and c@xmath13o ( @xcite ) .",
    "a co outflow with a good collimation was found in the east - west direction , inclined by @xmath14 to the sky plane , and an infrared lobe also lies in the axis of molecular outflow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , hatchell , fuller , & ladd ( 1999 ) and buckle , hatchell , & fuller ( 1999 ) examined the temperature variation in the outflow lobe and the shock structure of jet embedded in the lobe , respectively .",
    "however , the kinematics of the central condensation remains poorly understood , since the line asymmetry of optically thick transitions , known as a probe of internal motions of cores , differs from molecule to molecule .",
    "mardones et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and mardones ( 1998 ) obtained cs 21 , h@xmath1co @xmath15@xmath16 , and n@xmath1h@xmath4 10 lines with @xmath17 beams and mapped their spatial distributions .",
    "they found that the cs and h@xmath1co lines are self - reversed and the blue peak is slightly brighter than the red . on the other hand , gregersen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that the red peak is twice as strong as the blue one in the hco@xmath4 32 transition in a @xmath18 beam .",
    "the three hyperfine components of hcn 10 again exhibit the usual blue asymmetry with a @xmath19 beam : a single peak in the blue side with a shoulder in the red of the thinnest component ( @xmath20=01 ) changes into a deep self - absorption with a stronger blue peak of the thickest one ( @xmath20=21 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "a recent vla observation of nh@xmath0 indicates an inward motion down to @xmath21 scale ( @xcite ) .",
    "all these features suggest diverse velocity fields in this source , and this could be understood much better by aperture synthesis imaging .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the observation and the data reduction .",
    "results of our interferometric observation are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we discuss kinematics of the envelope and outflow as well as molecular abundance . in the final section",
    ", we summarize our results .",
    "since the hco@xmath4 molecule is most peculiar in line shape when compared with other molecules in single dish observations , the hco@xmath4 molecule is the one to be explored with a prime importance in this observational study .",
    "the hco@xmath4 10 transition has a critical density of @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the hco@xmath4 molecule may not be depleted in an envelope since there is no chemical reaction route to consume it ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it often delineates well outflow lobes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . thus it may be a good tracer of the density and motion of the envelope and the outflow .",
    "however , since the transition may be opaque , we selected c@xmath0h@xmath1 2@xmath2@xmath3 as a complementary probe to cold gas in the envelope . the c@xmath0h@xmath1 molecule has been extensively surveyed toward numerous galactic objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the single - peaked line profile of c@xmath0h@xmath1 toward l483 obtained from a single dish observation suggests that the transition is not so optically thick ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in l1157 it is found to trace an envelope mainly and is insensitive to an outflow or shocked region ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if a disk - like envelope is embedded in the core of l483 , we may be able to discern , by using c@xmath0h@xmath1 , rotation and/or radial ( inward / outward ) motions which are not contaminated by the outflow .",
    "the observation of the l483 was carried out with the 10 elements bima interferometer in its c configuration in october and november 1998 in the transitions of hco@xmath4 10 ( 89.188523 ghz ) and c@xmath0h@xmath1 2@xmath21@xmath24 ( 85.338905 ghz ) .",
    "we configured correlator for hcn 10 line ( 88.631847 ghz ) as well , but the hcn data were discarded because of interference in the if band .",
    "system temperatures were typically @xmath25 k during the observation . projected baselines range from 1.7 k@xmath26 to 23 k@xmath26 , and",
    "phase center was the position of iras 18148 - 0440 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the phase and pass band were calibrated using 1743 - 038 and 3c273 , respectively .",
    "we also made observations of uranus for flux calibration and the flux of 1743 - 038 was @xmath29 jy at the time of observation .",
    "the if window with the band width of 12.5 mhz was fed into the 256 channels of the correlator for each transition , resulting in the velocity resolutions of 0.164 km s@xmath10 and 0.172 km s@xmath10 in the hco@xmath4 and c@xmath0h@xmath1 transitions , respectively .",
    "continua in both upper and lower side bands were simultaneously observed with a 800 mhz bandwidth in total .",
    "we reduced the data using the miriad package .",
    "the data were flagged and fourier transformed with natural weighting .",
    "the resulting dirty map was cleaned and restored with a gaussian beam of a fwhm size of @xmath30 at position angle @xmath31 measured from north to east .",
    "in addition , in january 1999 , one point observation of hco@xmath4 10 was undertaken toward the iras source using the radome - enclosed 14 meter telescope ( beam size = @xmath32 ) of taeduk radio astronomy observatory , korea .",
    "the sis receiver was used for the frontend and the system temperature was 400 k at the time of observation .",
    "the backend was an autocorrelation spectrometer with a 20 khz or 0.067 km s@xmath10 resolution .",
    "fig .  1 represents the continuum emission detected around the position of iras 18148 - 0440 .",
    "there is diffuse emission in the ne  sw direction .",
    "the continuum source is barely resolved in the direction of major beam axis , but extended in the e - w direction . by deconvolving the beam",
    ", we roughly estimate the size of condensation , 2000 au and 3000 au in the n - s and e - w directions , respectively .",
    "the estimated total flux is 16 mjy , which is consistent with spectral energy distribution measured from centimeter to near infrared ( @xcite ) . using a mass absorption coefficient ,",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 g@xmath10 ( @xcite ) , we obtain the mass of 0.13 m@xmath35 for the condensation .",
    "we illustrate the distribution of c@xmath0h@xmath1 in fig .  2 .",
    "the line is single - peaked with the fwhm width of 0.32 km s@xmath10 and centered at the systemic velocity of 5.4 km s@xmath10 , which is in accordance with the single dish observations of optically thin n@xmath1h@xmath4 and c@xmath0h@xmath1 lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "the emission peak at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is displaced by @xmath38 to the west of the continuum emission .",
    "the c@xmath0h@xmath1 emission is extended from north to south and its half - power contour larger than the synthesized beam is almost circular . from the figure",
    ", we note that the c@xmath0h@xmath1 emission delineates the envelope around the protostar fairly well .",
    "the single dish observation at high spatial resolution in the c@xmath13o 32 transition revealed the structure that is similar , but slightly elongated in the n - s direction ( @xcite ) .    in order to examine the kinematics of the envelope ,",
    "we plot channel maps in fig .  3 , where there are mainly three components .",
    "the main component at @xmath36(@xmath39 ) with @xmath40 km s@xmath10 contains most of the mass of the envelope .",
    "the remaining ones are at @xmath36(@xmath41 ) with @xmath42 km s@xmath10 and at @xmath36(@xmath43 ) with @xmath44 km s@xmath10 .",
    "extended features in the n ",
    "s direction in the figure frame of 5.41 km s@xmath10 may result from side lobe effect .",
    "the 5.0 and 6.0 km s@xmath10 components are minor fragments of the envelope .",
    "the systematic displacement of peak positions of the main component along with the lsr velocity suggests a velocity gradient which is seen more clearly in the position - velocity diagrams of fig .",
    "along the outflow axis of @xmath45 ( see section 3.3 ) through the c@xmath0h@xmath1 emission peak at ( @xmath37 ) , is a uniform velocity gradient of the main component , amounting to @xmath46 km s@xmath10 over @xmath47 or 13 km s@xmath10 pc@xmath10 .",
    "it is found that line wing is of little importance as expected in section 2 and the line _ itself _ is gradually shifted .",
    "the figure also shows that the 5.0 km s@xmath10 feature is isolated indeed . on the other hand ,",
    "the position - velocity diagram across the outflow axis shows little sign of systematic motion .",
    "we are not confident with the current resolution that the component at @xmath48 with 5.6 km s@xmath10 is a discrete one .",
    "a plausible explanation of those velocity shifts would be that the envelope has a flattened structure and the velocity gradient represents a gas infall motion toward the central source , whereas the existence of rotation is uncertain ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , one has to be careful since the sense of the velocity shift of infalling flat disk or envelope is always the same as that of outflow motion .",
    "for instance , the shift of c@xmath0h@xmath1 line shown in l1228 results from the fragments of core entrained to an outflow ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is difficult to figure out which one is dominant for l483 , given the c@xmath0h@xmath1 data only .",
    "however , the velocity shift by outflow is less likely for l483 , since the hco@xmath4 line suggests that there is expanding motion as a part of outflow around the envelope and the velocity field is almost isotropic ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "if the c@xmath0h@xmath1 line is affected by this motion , there will be little velocity gradient .",
    "fuller and wooten ( 2000 ) recently found the inward motion by carrying out the vla observation using the nh@xmath0 inversion lines .    the infall motion of l483 inferred from the position - velocity map of fig",
    ".  4 is different from a free - fall motion of @xmath49 toward a central star with a mass of @xmath50 which has usually been invoked for , e.g. , l1527 , hh111 , and other ysos ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity gradient is rather linear , suggestive of a collapse of a ( pressure - free ) gas sphere with a uniform density .",
    "we would argue that it is not an accretion toward the central source , but a global contraction of the envelope .",
    "this is consistent with the current understanding of the class 0 objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "our interpretation , however , may be subject to the spatial and spectral resolutions of observation .",
    "further observations with higher resolutions are necessary to elucidate the kinematics and structure of the envelope .      in fig .  5",
    ", we plot the distribution of the red and blue hco@xmath4 10 wing emission .",
    "the red wing is integrated from 6.5 to 11.0 km s@xmath10 , while the blue wing from @xmath51 to 4.5 km s@xmath10 .",
    "it is found that the bipolar outflow is well collimated and the peaks of the two outflow lobes are separated each other by @xmath52 .",
    "the shape of the outflow is similar to those found from co 21 ( @xcite ) , from co 32 ( @xcite ) , and from co 43 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outflow lies close to the r.a .",
    "axis ( p.a.@xmath53 ) .",
    "the different amounts of extinction towards the lobes in the ir band suggest an inclination of the outflow of @xmath14 to the sky plane ( @xcite ) .    in order to see details of the outflow",
    ", we display channel maps of hco@xmath4 in fig .",
    "it is found that there are at least three discrete components in the red shifted outflows : the 5.9 km s@xmath10 component around @xmath36(@xmath54 ) , the 6.1 km s@xmath10 component centered at @xmath36(@xmath55 ) , and the 7.2 km s@xmath10 component near @xmath36(@xmath56 ) .",
    "the 7.2 km s@xmath10 component spans a wide range of velocity from 6.7 to 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the 5.9 km s@xmath10 component is much more widely distributed than the others which are relatively compact .",
    "the strong emission around ( @xmath57 ) in the velocity range of @xmath58 km s@xmath10 represents the red side of line core component coming from the envelope .",
    "there is little emission in the vicinity of line center ( @xmath59 km s@xmath10 ) over the whole field of view , due to heavy self - absorption .",
    "the emission on the blue side ( @xmath60 km s@xmath10 ) of the systemic component is absent , contrary to the one in the red side ( which will be discussed in the next section ) .",
    "interestingly , the blue outflow lobe also seems to have three discrete components and to share similar kinematics as the red lobe .",
    "one can find the 3.3 km s@xmath10 component farthest from the systemic velocity , located around @xmath36(@xmath61 ) whose velocity range is wide from 1.4 to 4.3 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the other two components have velocities of @xmath36 4.4 and 5.0 km s@xmath10 which reside at @xmath36(@xmath62 ) and ( @xmath63 ) , respectively .",
    "the 5.0 km s@xmath10 component closest to the rest velocity covers the largest area as the 5.9 km s@xmath10 one does in the red lobe .",
    "the fact that the individual velocity components can be identified and grouped into three pairs supports the idea of symmetric and episodic mass ejections .",
    "it may be claimed from the number of pairs that the mass loss phenomena have taken place at least three times in the past .",
    "there must be an ambient cloud or a cavity wall with velocity close to the systemic one which embeds these different velocity components , but this is probably resolved out , since its distribution would be extended .",
    "the shortest baseline mentioned in section 2 suggests that we are blind to structures larger than @xmath64 .",
    "the clumpiness and intermittency of the outflow is rather common in the case of extreme high velocity outflows ( @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that standard or low velocity outflows exhibit such features as well ( cf . @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that the component whose velocity is closer to the systemic one occupies larger area",
    ". this can be evidence that an opening angle of the outflow becomes wider as the yso evolves ( @xcite ) , provided that the ejected material is accelerated after the ejection from around zero velocity .",
    "if this assumption holds , then the high velocity component will be located far away from the driving source .",
    "actually the velocity roughly proportional to the distance away from the source is a reasonable approximation to the velocity field of the well - collimated flow , as can be seen in hh211 , ngc1333-iras2 , ngc2071 , and ngc2264 g ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is approximately true for the l483 as well , which is shown in the position - velocity diagram of fig .",
    "the velocity increase together with the distance from the source could also be made by other mechanisms like the simultaneous outburst of material with a wide range of velocities .",
    "however , this may not be applicable to the well - collimated outflows with narrow throats .",
    "on the other hand , one can imagine that the opening angle has been kept wide from the beginning , but the fastest mass ejection has taken place preferentially normal to the flat disk or envelope .",
    "although this is not the case for the general class 0 objects , this possibility can not be ruled out .",
    "the slowly moving material with wider opening angle could also be regarded as a remnant of a pre - existing shell which was slowly expanding and is swept up by the fast jet .",
    "all these invoke detailed understanding of the outflow and hence should be tested by further observation .",
    "the line strength of hco@xmath4 in the wings indicates that the molecule may be enhanced in the outflow region .",
    "we estimate the column density of hco@xmath4 and co in the outflow lobe in order to derive the relative abundance of hco@xmath4 to co. since the line wings are as wide as 5 km s@xmath10 along any line of sights , the condition of the _ large velocity gradient _ is applicable",
    ". then we can use an expression by goldreich & kwan ( 1974 ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the dipole moment of hco@xmath4 , @xmath67 is the velocity gradient , @xmath68 is the level population in the level @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the excitation temperature , and @xmath71 ) is 4.2 k. if we use an approximation , @xmath72 , @xmath73 where the column density @xmath74(hco@xmath4 ) is equal to @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath76 is derived from @xmath77 where @xmath78 . since @xmath79 k in the wings ( see fig .",
    "8) , @xmath80 for an assumed @xmath70 of 10 k. @xmath74(hco@xmath4 ) is then @xmath81 @xmath82 for @xmath83 km s@xmath10 . in the case that @xmath84 k , @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xmath82 .",
    "we derive the column density of co in the outflow lobe in a similar way by using the @xmath87=21 transitions of both @xmath88co and @xmath89co in hatchell , fuller , & ladd ( 1999 ) .",
    "the resulting co column density is @xmath90 @xmath82 , where we adopted @xmath91 and @xmath92 k. finally it is found that the abundance of hco@xmath4 relative to co is @xmath93 .",
    "this is comparable to the value of @xmath94 inferred either for the orion extended ridge or for the tmc-1 region ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we find no significant abundance enhancement of hco@xmath4 in the outflow .",
    "the line wings look rather strong simply due to the depression of the line core .",
    "line profiles of hco@xmath4 10 toward the envelope are displayed in fig .",
    "8 , where a spectrum obtained toward the iras source with the single dish telescope is shown together .",
    "emission from line core is mildly self - absorbed in the single dish observation , but suffers from severe self - absorption in the array observation , falling off close to zero .",
    "the self - absorption of the line core is usually amplified in the interferometric observation , since the rest velocity component is most extended and the lack of visibility data at short spacing filters it out . here",
    "it should be pointed out that the blue peak is weaker than the red one in the single dish observation and even almost missing in the interferometric one .",
    "this asymmetry is consistent with those of higher transitions of hco@xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all these observations strongly suggest that the stronger red peak is not an artifact caused by the limited uv coverage of interferometric observation , but an intrinsic property of the envelope of l483 .",
    "the stronger red peak of optically thick line is generally known as an _ anti - infall _ signature , indicative of an outward motion .",
    "however , it contradicts the observations of hcn , h@xmath1co , and nh@xmath0 , all implying the inward motion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    what gives rise to the anti - infall asymmetry of hco@xmath4 ?",
    "in answering this question , however , we should not violate observational facts of hcn , h@xmath1co , and nh@xmath0 supporting the collapse motion .",
    "first , we can consider the influence of the outflow .",
    "in addition to the self - absorption by the surface layer of the envelope , the blue lobe of the outflow in front of the envelope may further obscure the blue part of line core emission .",
    "however , since the outflow will have a higher excitation temperature than the envelope ( @xcite ) , it makes the emission from the envelope brighter irrespective of its optical depth : if the outflow is optically thin , the emission from the outflow should be added to that of envelope , while if the outflow is opaque , then the emission from outflow will replace it .",
    "therefore the outflow can not explain the anti - infall asymmetry of the line core .",
    "the asymmetry seems to arise from the envelope itself or very close to it .",
    "the envelope or material in its vicinity may be really in a state of almost isotropic expansion . here",
    "we recall that the material ( traced by hco@xmath4 ) whose velocity is close to the systemic one moves outward with a wide opening angle , whereas the envelope ( traced by c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) is collapsing .",
    "thus one viable option may be a nearly isotropic outward motion of gas between the disk - like envelope and the collimated outflow , which is actually a part of the outflow .",
    "if this motion takes place over a large amount of volume around the flattened envelope , then we will have line profiles with the anti - infall signature .",
    "the detail of the line shape depends on the velocity field in this expanding volume , but in any case the line will have the red peak stronger than the blue ( @xcite ) . to summarize , there is a highly collimated jet - like flow far from the central source , while there is a wide angle wind - like mass ejection at the base of the outflow .",
    "therefore the geometry and kinematics of the outflow of l483 seems to be in favor of the x - wind model as a low velocity version ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cep a - hw2 is one of the recent examples showing similar line shapes as l483 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then one may have to look for reason why only the hco@xmath4 reflects the expansion .",
    "this could be explained in terms of its abundance and excitation condition .",
    "the main route to form hco@xmath4 is the reaction between h@xmath95 and co. the hco@xmath4 is unlikely to be depleted , since both species are abundant in the quiescent and relatively diffuse clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as a consequence , although hco@xmath4 has a large critical density , it is collisionally excited easily at lower densities due to the line trapping . in this case",
    ", the critical density , @xmath96 , should be modified as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is an optical depth , as already pointed out by genzel ( 1991 ) .",
    "it is also shown with a simple lvg analysis that hco@xmath4 10 transition requires the lowest effective density , @xmath99 , among cs , h@xmath1co , hcn , and hco@xmath4 to produce the line intensity of 1 k for a given column density per unit velocity interval of @xmath100 , where the column density , @xmath74 , is given in @xmath82 and the line width , @xmath101 , in km s@xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "( at t@xmath102 k , @xmath103 @xmath23 for hco@xmath4 10 , while @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 @xmath23 , for cs 21 , h@xmath1co 2@xmath21@xmath107 , and hcn 10 , respectively . )",
    "thus the expanding part of the envelope could be more effectively traced by the hco@xmath4 10 transition than by other transitions .",
    "park , kim , and minh ( 1999 ) compared the line profiles of hco@xmath4 32 & 43 , h@xmath1co 2@xmath21@xmath107 , cs 21 , and hcn 10 of 9 class 0 and i objects , and found that the hco@xmath4 molecule seems to prefer the anti - infall asymmetry than the hcn and possibly the cs does .",
    "the preference is very marginal due to a small number of samples , but this could be indirect evidence supporting the idea mentioned above .      as shown in fig .  1 , the position of continuum peak coincides with that of iras 18148 - 0440 within @xmath108 , while the peak of c@xmath0h@xmath1 emission is displaced to the west by @xmath38 from it .",
    "although hco@xmath4 is severely saturated , the emission peak of the red part of the systemic component at @xmath109 km s@xmath10 is roughly coincident with that of c@xmath0h@xmath1 , as represented in fig .",
    "are the two sources really different condensations ?",
    "the error ellipse of the iras source position is as large as @xmath110 with a position angle of @xmath111 ( iras point source catalogue ) .",
    "however , it is found from the vla observation that the 3.6 cm and 6 cm continuum source is detected exactly at the iras position and there is no emission at the position of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 emission peak .",
    "although the vla beam is @xmath112 and @xmath113 at 3.6 cm and 6 cm , respectively , the accuracy in determining the peak position should be better than @xmath114 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the far - infrared ( @xmath115 m ) and submillimeter ( @xmath116 m ) continuum emission are also detected at the iras source position , but the beams are as large as @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently fuller and wooten ( 2000 ) mapped the region at @xmath119 and @xmath120 and found an elongated condensation at the iras position with @xmath121 whose ( beam - convolved ) fwhm size is @xmath122 . thus there may be an object at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) which is unveiled only in millimeter line emission and possibly in the continuum from sub - millimeter to far - infrared .",
    "however , it is more likely that the line emission of c@xmath0h@xmath1 and hco@xmath4 and the continuum emission emanate from the same condensation but that the molecular line emission is depressed around the dust condensation by some reasons .",
    "one of the reasons may be that the gas is frozen out onto the grain in the cold and dense environment .",

    "an envelope with a beam - deconvolved size of @xmath123 au ( r.a . ) @xmath8 2000 au ( dec . ) and with a mass of @xmath6 is found to collapse towards its center .",
    "the collapse motion is different from the shu type ( @xmath124 ) , but more likely linear with a velocity gradient of @xmath125 km s@xmath10 pc@xmath10 .",
    "the yso seems to undergo main accretion phase without any conclusive signature of rotation .",
    "the molecular outflow traced by hco@xmath4 10 suggests that there have been successive ( at least three times ) mass loss events to date and that the recent ejection might take place with a wide opening angle compared with previous ones .",
    "the rest velocity component of the hco@xmath4 line is found to exhibit the anti - infall signature , while the other transitions of density tracing molecules like cs , h@xmath1co , and hcn are not .",
    "if the outflow is poorly collimated at its base , the outward motion directed radially would be pervasive in both sides of the flattened envelope and responsible for the hco@xmath4 10 line biased to the red .",
    "due to the ease of collisional excitation and little chance of depletion , the hco@xmath4 10 is the most likely transition with which one can sense the outward motion ."
