    "mass transfer in cataclysmic variables ( cvs hereafter ) is driven by angular momentum loss mechanisms .",
    "magnetic braking is considered the main driver for orbital periods longer than @xmath63 h , although its actual prescription is under debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a result of mass transfer , the radius of the donor star is adjusted ( 1 ) on a thermal time - scale to try preserving thermal equilibrium and ( 2 ) on a dynamical time - scale to return to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the competition between the changing stellar and roche lobe radii sets the mass transfer rate and hence its stability . for large mass ratios",
    "the binary could be unstable against rapid mass transfer and a common envelope may ensue @xcite .",
    "sy cnc is one of the brightest z cam - type dwarf novae , exhibiting regular outbursts every @xmath727 days .",
    "@xcite reported an orbital period @xmath8 d and @xmath9 which was interpreted as evidence for unstable mass transfer .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath10 was derived indirectly using observed properties of the @xmath11 emission line and this method is not entirely reliable because the accretion disc s emissivity is often found to be non - axisymmetric and contaminated by hot - spots .",
    "the best way to constrain @xmath10 is by combining the radial velocity semiamplitude of the donor star @xmath12 with the rotational broadening of its absorption lines @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the issue of the high @xmath10 value was revisited by @xcite who measured @xmath14 km s@xmath3 from a skew map of the na  i ir doublet .",
    "however , the poor spectral resolution hindered a direct determination of @xmath13 and hence @xmath12 was combined with @xmath15 ( from the wings of the @xmath11 line , * ? ? ? * ) to yield a revised @xmath16 .",
    "they also classify the donor star as m0 , which must be substantially evolved in order to fill its 9.1 h roche lobe .    here",
    "we present new higher resolution spectra of sy cnc demonstrating that the spectrum of the donor star is clearly detected at optical wavelengths .",
    "we update the orbital parameters and present the first determination of the rotational broadening of the donor star , which removes the lingering uncertainty on the true mass ratio .",
    "we also find that the spectrum of the donor is best fitted by a late g star and discuss the observed properties in the light of mass - transfer stability and the evolution of sy cnc .",
    "sy cnc was observed over several nights between 1992 and 2008 using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) attached to the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos .",
    "the 27 spectra were always obtained in the @xmath11 region but using three gratings and slightly different instrumental settings ( slit widths and central wavelengths ) , which resulted in spectral resolutions in the range 25 - 70 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the nights were allocated to various scientific programs and hence only a few spectra of sy cnc were obtained per night .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table [ tabobs ] .",
    "spectra of the stellar templates 61 cyg a & b ( k5v and k7v ) were also observed during the 2008 run for the purpose of radial velocities and rotational broadening analysis .",
    "in addition , eight templates of spectral types g6-m0v were collected during the 2003 campaign and another k5v in 1999 .    the images were bias corrected and flat - fielded , and the spectra subsequently extracted using conventional optimal extraction techniques in order to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of the output @xcite .",
    "every target was bracketed with observations of a comparison cuar+cune arc lamp and the pixel - to - wavelength scale was derived through polynomial fits to a large number of identified reference lines .",
    "the final rms scatter of the fit was always @xmath171/30 of the spectral dispersion .",
    ".log of the observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we rectified the 27 individual spectra by subtracting a low - order spline fit to the continuum , after masking out the main emission and atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "the spectra were subsequently rebinned into a uniform velocity scale of 36 km s@xmath3 pix@xmath3 .",
    "the k5v template 61 cyg a was broadened to 78 km s@xmath3 to match the width of the donor photospheric lines ( see sect .",
    "every spectrum of sy cnc was then cross - correlated against the broadened template in the spectral regions free from emission and telluric absorption features .",
    "radial velocities were extracted following the method of @xcite , where parabolic fits were performed to the peak of the cross - correlation functions , and the uncertainties are purely statistical . since the orbital period is poorly constrained to 0.380 @xmath18 d we performed a power spectrum analysis on the radial velocities in the range 0.1 - 2 days , and the results are displayed in fig . [ figperiod ] .",
    "here we have rescaled the errorbars by a factor 1.3 so that the minimum @xmath19 is 1.0 .",
    "the periodogram is dominated by strong aliasing due to the sparse sampling of our observations . in order to test the significance of the different peaks above the noise level we performed a monte carlo simulation .",
    "synthetic @xmath20 periodograms were computed from a large population ( 10@xmath21 ) of velocities randomly picked from a white - noise distribution and with identical time sampling as our data .",
    "a 4-@xmath22 significance level is defined by the 99.99 per cent of the computed @xmath23 values and this is indicated in fig .",
    "[ figperiod ] by a horizontal dashed line .",
    "most of the peaks between frequencies 2.5 - 2.7 day@xmath3 are under the line and hence periods in the range 0.37 - 0.40 days are significantly above noise at the 99.99 per cent level .",
    "the two deeper peaks correspond to 0.3824 day and 0.3837 day and have @xmath24 and 2.3 respectively for 24 degrees of freedom .",
    "a 4-@xmath22 significance level around the minimm peak will exclude the second peak @xcite and hence we can conclude that 0.3824 day is by far the most significant period",
    ". a least - squares sine - wave fit to the radial velocities , using @xmath25 day as input parameter , yields the following parameters    @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29    where @xmath30 corresponds to the heliocentric julian date of the inferior conjunction of the donor star .",
    "all quoted errors are 68 per cent confidence .",
    "the systemic velocity @xmath31 has been corrected from the radial velocity of 61 cyg a , that we take as -64.3 @xmath00.9 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "note that a sinewave fit fixing @xmath32 day also yields @xmath33 km s@xmath3 , an indication that our @xmath12 value is robust and its error realistic , irrespectively of the true value of the orbital period .",
    "the same is found when other peaks around the minimum are taken .",
    "[ figrv ] displays the radial velocity points folded on our favoured orbital period @xmath34 day together with the best sine fit solution .",
    "our @xmath12 velocity disagrees with the one reported by @xcite which was obtained using the 8190-   na  i doublet .",
    "we note that the na  i doublet can be quenched by heating effects , as opposed to the metallic lines used by us @xcite .",
    "if this were the case , the light centre of the na  i lines would be displaced towards the back side of the star .",
    "the effects of irradiation can be estimated using the k - correction approach of @xcite @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the increment in @xmath12 velocity due to irradiation , @xmath37 the radius of the donor star , @xmath38 the binary separation and @xmath39 the fractional displacement of the absorption line s site with respect to the center of mass of the star . in the extreme case ,",
    "when the na  i absorption is completely supressed from the irradiated hemisphere , @xmath40 .",
    "thus , replacing @xmath41 by eggleton s equation @xcite and adopting @xmath42 ( see next section ) we find @xmath43 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this difference is just enough to accommodate smith et al s value with ours , for maximum quenching of the na  i lines .",
    "therefore , we conclude that smith et al s @xmath12 is likely a significant overestimate due to irradiation while our value is much less affected by these effects .",
    "in order to measure the rotational broadening of the donor s absorption features we have focused on the 10 highest resolution spectra gathered during the 2003 campaign .",
    "we broadened the g6-m0 templates from 5 to 100 km s@xmath3 in steps of 5 km s@xmath3 , using a gray profile @xcite and continuum limb - darkening coefficients appropriate for every spectral type and our wavelength range .",
    "the broadened templates were multiplied by factors @xmath44 , to account for the fractional contribution to the total light .",
    "these were subsequently subtracted from the doppler corrected average of sy cnc , obtained using our orbital solution above .",
    "the optimal broadening , based on a @xmath20 test on the residuals , is always found in the range 77 - 80 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the mean of these determinations is @xmath45 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the quoted error corresponds to 1-@xmath22 and has been estimated by fitting a cubic function to the @xmath20 vs @xmath13 curve and searching for @xmath46 .",
    "a potential source of systematics in this calculation is the assumption of continuum limb - darkening coefficient because absorption lines in late - type stars are expected to have smaller core limb - darkening coefficients than the continuum @xcite .",
    "we have tested this by repeating the above analysis using zero limb - darkening as a secure lower limit and obtain @xmath47 km s@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we decided to adopt @xmath48 km s@xmath3 as a conservative value for @xmath13 hereafter .",
    "the minimum @xmath20 also constrains the donor s spectral type to g9-k3v .",
    "the same analysis was independently performed using the lower resolution data from 1999 and 2008 , which yield consistent results at @xmath49 and @xmath50 km s@xmath3 , respectively . in the latter case",
    "the k5v template produces a lower minimum @xmath20 than the k7v , an indication that the donor star is earlier than k5 .",
    "is well constrained between spectral types g6.5v and k0v.,width=283 ]    to further constrain the spectral type we employed a set of high resolution ( r=@xmath51=55000 - 11000 ) spectra covering g0-k7v from ecuvillon et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) and @xcite .",
    "these are hd 39091 ( g0v ) , hd 30495 ( g1.5v ) , hd 43162 ( g6.5v ) , hd69830 ( k0v ) , hd 17925 ( k1.5v ) , hd 222237 ( k3v ) , hd 216803 ( k4v ) and hd 157881 ( k7v ) .",
    "these stars have very accurate stellar parameters @xmath52 and metallicities so they can provide a more robust spectral type classification .",
    "these were downgraded to the instrumental resolution of the 2008 int data and broadened using our @xmath13 estimate .",
    "[ figsptype ] displays the @xmath20 of the optimal subtraction as a function of the template s spectral type .",
    "the minimum is found for g6.5v and k0v and thus we classify the donor star as a g8 @xmath53v .",
    "this is again remarkably different from the m0 suggested by @xcite whereas it is in better agreement with the work of @xcite who propose an early g star based on ir spectra .",
    "[ figopts ] presents the 2008 average spectrum of sy cnc , doppler corrected in the rest frame of the donor star , together with one of the best templates .",
    "the latter must be scaled by a factor 0.42@xmath00.02 to match the depth of the absorption features in sy cnc and hence we conclude that the donor star contributes 42 per cent to the total flux in the @xmath54 region .",
    "since the donor star is filling its roche lobe and synchronized , we can combine our determination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 to constrain the binary mass ratio through the equation :    @xmath55    this uses eggleton s expression for the effective radius of the roche lobe @xcite , which is more accurate than pacyski s approximation @xcite . substituting our values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 into equation ( 1 ) we find @xmath56 , where the error has been estimated using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the input parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 have been picked up randomly from normal distributions whose mean and sigma correspond to the observed values and the process is repeated @xmath57 times .",
    "this is one of the highest , accurately measured , mass ratio in a cv , only comparable to v363 aur with @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "for instance , the 7.10 edition of the ritter & kolb catalogue @xcite lists seven systems in 731 entries with @xmath59 .",
    "however , only v363 aur and ac cnc possess robust @xmath10 values because these are derived through a measurement of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the remaining five should be regarded as tentative given the difficulty in deriving stellar masses in the absence of donor stellar features .",
    "theoretical studies of binary evolution show that stable mass transfer depends on both the thermal and dynamical response of the donor star to mass loss .",
    "this is described by the thermal and adiabatic radius - mass exponents , computed for the case of zams donor stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when compared with the tidal radius - mass exponent ( i.e. the logarithmic derivative of the roche lobe radius with respect to the donor mass ) they define a critical mass ratio for stable mass transfer",
    "the radius - mass exponents , in turn , depend on the donor s mass so a combination of ( @xmath60 ) values is required to fulfil the condition for stable mass transfer .",
    "sy cnc presents a remarkable case because of its high ( and accurate ) mass ratio which places it close to the absolute upper limit of mass transfer stability computed by @xcite .",
    "[ figstab ] shows the critical mass ratio curves for dynamical ( solid line ) and thermal stability ( dashed line ) as a function of the donor mass , updated after figs . 1 and 2 from @xcite .",
    "for sy cnc to lie in the stable mass - transfer region ( i.e. below the two curves ) our central value @xmath42 yields @xmath610.77 - 1.54 m@xmath62 .",
    "this would imply a white dwarf mass @xmath63 m@xmath62 and , since @xmath64 m@xmath62 , then @xmath65 .",
    "however , the theoretical stability limits are computed under the assumption of zams donor stars which is not necessarily true .",
    "donor stars in cvs have on average later spectral types than field main - sequence stars , an indication of radius expansion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that donor stars with @xmath66 h were likely nuclear - evolved at the start of mass transfer .",
    "this alters the helium - to - hydrogen composition and hence the response of the star to mass loss .",
    "therefore , the critical mass ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ figstab ] should be regarded as mere indicative limits .",
    "our determination of the spectral type also provides a new ingredient to constrain the evolution of the donor star in sy cnc .",
    "a g8 zams has @xmath67 m@xmath62 which would place it reasonably well within the stability region .",
    "a donor with such mass would fill @xmath68 per cent of its 9.1 h roche lobe .",
    "the conclusion seems to be that the companion star is a slightly evolved main sequence , in contrast with previous claims by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , sy cnc could be descending from a progenitor binary with a more extreme mass ratio which underwent a phase of thermal - timescale mass transfer .",
    "the importance of this evolutionary path has been addressed by several papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and successfully explains the cooler - than - main - sequence donor stars typically observed at @xmath69 h orbital periods .",
    "natural consequences of this scenario are larger white dwarf masses and evidence for cno processed material , both seen in ae aqr @xcite .",
    "the detection of nuclear processed material in uv spectra of sy cnc would clarify the evolutionary history of sy cnc and whether it is the outcome of a thermal mass - transfer episode .",
    "further , more higher resolution observations will provide better constraints on @xmath13 , @xmath12 , the stellar masses and the evolution of the donor star in this important cv .",
