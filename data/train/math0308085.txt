    "the semi - flow comes down from the branch line , @xmath1 , forming two branches .",
    "the x - branch has @xmath2 half twists , while the y - branch has @xmath3 .",
    "the sign convention for the twists is that left - handed twists are positive and right - handed ones are negative .",

    "not the unknot ) .",
    "we call @xmath14 and @xmath15 _ factors _ of @xmath16 and write @xmath17 if a knot is nt composite then it is _ prime_.    figure  [ fig3.eps ] gives an example",

    "[ thm_ln-2inln ] as sets of knots , @xmath18 , for all integers @xmath3 .          where the orientable and nonorientable cases are listed separately .",
    "we have also noted that two of the set inclusions are proper .",
    "lorenz knots are positive braids @xcite , but @xmath21 has a negative braid .",
    "( to construct one , trace out the periodic orbit that wraps around the x - branch once and the y - branch three times . )",
    "knots in @xmath22 are prime while @xmath23 has composite knots .",
    "it is not known which , if any , of the other set inclusions are proper .",
    "the proof again is pictorial .",
    "we start with @xmath28 , which is identical to @xmath21 . by cutting along certain orbits and gradually deforming the template we will make the knots in question become clearly visible .",
    "most of the steps in figure  [ a - w](a - w ) should be self evident .",

    "in going from figure ( j ) to ( k ) we have thrown away part of the template to help make the remaining steps clearer .",
    "the template of ( n ) is shown in ( o ) with lines to cut along .",
    "this divides ( o ) into two parts , ( p ) and ( t ) . to see that any pair of orbits on ( p ) and ( t ) respectively can be summed on ( n ) just study the example in figure  [ fig6.eps ]",
    "following from ( p ) to ( s ) we get @xmath27 .",
    "likewise , ( t ) to ( w ) gives @xmath21 .    in figure  [ fig6.eps ]",
    "we show a composite knot on ( n ) which is the square knot . in figure  [ bigknot.eps ]",
    "we display this knot on the original form of the template .",
    "the reader can check this by reversing all the steps while carrying the knot back .",
    "thus theorems 1 and 2 imply that for all negative integers @xmath3 , @xmath24 contains composite knots .",
    "in fact theorem 2 shows how to construct many examples of composite knots on @xmath21 and hence for any lorenz - like template with an even number of negative twists on one its branches .",
    "the theorem below does this for the odd cases ."
