    "l@xmath0  puppis ( hr 2748 ; hip 34922 ) is a bright nearby red giant with a pulsation period of about 140d . in paper  i ( bedding et al . 2002 ) , we showed that the star has undergone a remarkable change in mean visual magnitude over the past century , and is currently undergoing a dramatic decline .",
    "we argued that the most likely cause is the recent formation of dust in an extended atmosphere . in this paper , we discuss the pulsation behaviour of the star and suggest that convection makes a significant contribution to the driving mechanism .",
    "the mechanism by which pulsations are excited in long - period variables is a subject of current interest .",
    "mira variables have large amplitudes and are very regular , reflecting the nature of the driving process , which is self - excitation via opacity variations ( i.e. the @xmath1-mechanism ) .",
    "semiregular variables ( srs ) , by contrast , have smaller amplitudes and less regular light curves .",
    "the nature of these irregularities is far from being understood .",
    "multiple periodicity has been found in many cases and is generally interpreted in terms of multimode pulsations ( kiss et al .",
    "1999 , percy et al .",
    "this interpretation was also supported by the multiple period - luminosity relations of srs in the magellanic clouds ( wood et al .",
    "1999 , wood 2000 ) and by observed mode changes in several semiregular stars ( cadmus et al .",
    "1991 , percy & desjardnis 1996 , bedding et al .",
    "1998 , kiss et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , even the clearest examples of multiply periodic srs exhibit seemingly irregular additional changes in the light curves ( lebzelter & kiss 2001 , kerschbaum et al .",
    "2001 ) , so that multimode pulsation with stationary frequency and amplitude content does not fully explain the light variations in srs .",
    "other explanations suggested in the literature include chaotic phenomena ( icke et al .",
    "1992 , buchler et al .",
    "2004 ) , coupling of rotation and pulsation ( barnbaum et al .",
    "1995 , soszynski et al . 2004 ) and dust - shell dynamics ( hfner et al . 1995 , 2003 ) .",
    "studies of radial velocity variability in srs ( lebzelter et al . 2000 , lebzelter & hinkle 2002 ) suggested that light variations are dominated by stellar pulsations , which implies that the observed irregularities must be largely related to stochastic behaviour of the oscillations .    in semiregulars",
    ", it seems plausible that there is a substantial contribution to the excitation and damping from convection . indeed , christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have suggested that the amplitude variability seen in these stars is consistent with the pulsations being solar - like , i.e. , stochastically excited by convection ( see bouchy & carrier 2003 and bedding & kjeldsen 2003 for recent reviews of solar - like oscillations ) .",
    "note that we are following convention by referring to oscillations as ` solar - like ' if , like those in the sun , they are stochastically excited and damped .",
    "this is in contrast to oscillations in `` classical '' pulsating stars , such as miras and cepheids , in which the excitation occurs via a feedback in opacity variations ( the @xmath1 mechanism ) .",
    "we stress that in other ways , the oscillations in red giants are definitely not solar - like . for example , the sun oscillates in many modes , both radial and non - radial , whereas red giants oscillate in only a handful of modes that are thought to be exclusively radial . in k giants , the subject of mira - like versus solar - like excitation of the oscillations has been discussed by dziembowski et al .",
    "they attempted theoretical modelling of the oscillations in @xmath2  uma and other red giants and suggested that there might even be a mixture of mira - like and solar - like modes in certain cases .",
    "the question of solar - like oscillations in srs was discussed by bedding ( 2003 ) , who interpreted the lorentzian shape of the power spectra of several bright srs as evidence for stochastically excited oscillations . here",
    "we further develop this idea by analysing the decades - long visual light curve of l@xmath0  pup .",
    "pup , showing the gradual mean brightness variations as 10-day means ( top ) and the corresponding amplitude spectrum ( bottom ) .",
    "the small insert shows the spectral window ( in amplitude ) , with sidelobes at @xmath31 cycle per year ( 0.0027 c / d ) reflecting annual gaps in the data . ]",
    "the updated light curve of l@xmath0  pup is plotted in the top panel of fig.[l2-all ] . the observations since jd 2451000 were made by a.j .",
    "jones , p. williams and l.l . kiss .",
    "the dataset consists of 1981 points between jd 2425249 and 2453487 , each one being a 10-day average .",
    "this is roughly 1000 days longer than in fig .  1 of paper  i and it clearly shows that the latest dimming event is still in progress , though it may have slowed down a little bit . the frequency spectrum ( bottom panel in fig.[l2-all ] )",
    "is dominated by a set of low - frequency peaks , caused by the slow variations of the mean brightness , and the main group of closely separated peaks at the pulsation frequency @xmath40.007 c / d .",
    "there is also a slight indication of an increased amplitude density around @xmath40.015 c / d , which may be attributed to either a harmonic of the main pulsation ( indicating non - sinusoidal variations ) or a second ( overtone ) pulsation mode .",
    "pup ( after removal of the long - term trend ) .",
    "each segment shows a 2375-d long subset , which covers roughly 17 cycles .",
    "the mean photometric uncertainty is about the same as the symbol size . ]",
    "details of the light curve can be seen in fig .",
    "[ l2-panels ] . here , we subtracted the mean trend of the light curve by fitting a low - order polynomial to the data .",
    "individual cycles have peak - to - peak amplitudes ranging from practically zero up to over 2 magnitudes , with no cycles having the same shape .",
    "this illustrates very well the semiregular nature of l@xmath0  pup .",
    "there seems to be no correlation between the actual mean brightness and amplitude or cycle shape , which supports the idea that gradual brightness changes are not coupled to the pulsations .",
    "the data were submitted to the following analysis :    * the mode lifetime was determined from a power spectrum fit ; * phase variations were compared to a true mira star with the same period ; * the presence of low - dimensional chaos was tested with phase space reconstruction .",
    "the power spectrum of the light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] .",
    "we show a close - up of the region corresponding to the 140-day pulsation period , and see that the power is split into a series of peaks under a narrow envelope .",
    "note that the long term trends in the light curve , which we discussed in detail in paper  i , are irrelevant here because they occur at much lower temporal frequencies .",
    "we have verified that removing these long - term variations by subtracting a low - order polynomial has neglible effect on the power spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] .",
    "the power distribution in fig .  [ fig.power ] is typical of a stochastically excited oscillator and is strikingly similar to close - up views of individual peaks in the power spectrum of solar oscillations . assuming a stochastically excited damped oscillator , we have fitted a lorentzian profile assuming @xmath5 statistics with two degrees of freedom .",
    "this is based on a maximum likelihood fit assuming an exponential distribution of the noise ( anderson et al .",
    "1990 , toutain & frhlich 1992 ) .",
    "the fit gives a period of 138.3d with a half - width at half power of @xmath6d@xmath7 , which implies a mode lifetime of @xmath8yr ( i.e. approximately 12.5 pulsation cycles ) .",
    "close - up view of the power spectrum around the frequency of pulsations . ]",
    "this represents one of the first measurements of mode lifetime ( or damping time ) in a star with solar - like oscillations .",
    "apart from the sun itself , in which the lifetime is a 24 days ( e.g. chaplin et al .",
    "1997 ) , there are recent measurement of oscillation lifetimes in four stars .",
    "bedding et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and kjeldsen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported mode lifetimes of 23 d in both @xmath2  cen a and b. for the g giant @xmath9  hya stello et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested a lifetime of @xmath42 days ( about 20 mean cycle lengths ) , which is much shorter than was calculated theoretically ( houdek & gough 2002 ) .",
    "finally , in the k giant arcturus , which is the closest example to l@xmath0  pup , photometric data taken by the star tracker on the wire satellite implied strongly damped oscillations with a lifetime comparable to the mean period of 2.8 days ( retter et al . 2003 ) . since the damping rate depends on the stellar structure and convection properties in a complex way with a number of weakly constrained theoretical parameters ( e.g. balmforth 1992 ) , and moreover , there are no theoretical calculations directly applicable to l@xmath0  pup , it is currently impossible to qualify the agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "we will address the dependence of mode lifetime on main physical parameters in a subsequent study of bright semiregular variables .",
    "could the oscillations in l@xmath0  pup be driven entirely by convection , without any input from the @xmath1-mechanism ? this has been suggested for semiregular variables by christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who described such oscillations as solar - like .",
    "the expected amplitude is highly uncertain , but we may extrapolate from solar - type stars using empirical scaling laws .",
    "visual photometric amplitudes of red giant stars are highly dependent on the mean temperature , whereas velocity measurements , when available , give a more direct measure of the physical pulsation amplitude .",
    "kjeldsen & bedding ( 1995 ) proposed that the velocity amplitude of solar - like oscillations should scale as @xmath10 .",
    "more recently , kjeldsen & bedding ( 2001 ) suggested a revised scaling relation ( to account for low observed amplitudes in f stars ) , in which velocity amplitude scales as @xmath11 ( which is proportional to @xmath12 ) .    adopting @xmath13 , @xmath14k and @xmath15 ( jura et al . 2002 ) , the original and revised scaling relations predict velocity semi - amplitudes for l@xmath0  pup of about 400 m/s and 3 km  s@xmath7 , respectively . from the observational side ,",
    "there are two published radial velocity measurements for l@xmath0  pup : cummings et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured a semi - amplitude of about 2.5 km  s@xmath7 , while lebzelter et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported six data points in a full range of 12 km  s@xmath7 over almost three pulsation cycles , implying a semi - amplitude of 6 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "given the large uncertainties of the extrapolated relations , the observed amplitudes do not contradict predictions .",
    "it therefore seems possible that the oscillations in l@xmath0  pup are excited entirely by convection , with no mira - like contribution .",
    "pup , w  cyg and x  cam . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the components of the gbor transform , which give the instantaneous phase as @xmath18 . ]",
    "we find further evidence for non - mira behaviour from a comparison of phase changes in l@xmath0  pup with those of a true mira with a very similar pulsation period .",
    "a well - observed northern circumpolar star is x  cam , for which the general catalogue of variable stars ( kholopov et al .",
    "1985 - 1988 ) lists @xmath19 , @xmath20=143.56d .",
    "we downloaded its visual data collected by the association franaise des observateurs detoiles variables ( afoev ) , extending back to the early 20th century , and binned them into 10-day averages .",
    "also , as an example of a `` real '' semiregular , we took visual data of w  cyg , an srb type star with two dominant periodicities , 131d and 235d ( howarth 1991 ) .",
    "then we calculated the following quantities for each star :    @xmath21    @xmath22    which are closely related to the fourier transform of the light curve @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the only difference is the presence of the gaussian weight - function @xmath25 , which was used as a moving window over the light curve ( in other words , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the real and the imaginary components of the gbor transform ; for a recent review of related transforms see buchler & kollth 2001 ) . in our case , @xmath25 was centered at @xmath26 and ran between @xmath27 and @xmath28 with a time step of 50 days , and the full - width at half maximum was fixed as 700 days ( about 5 cycles ) .",
    "this way we could measure the local phase @xmath29 at fixed frequency @xmath30 . for x  cam we determined @xmath20=143.69d , very close to the gcvs value , while for l@xmath0  pup we used the mean period given by the center of the fitted lorentzian ( 138.3d ) . in the case of w  cyg , we took the shorter period ( 131d ) , which is the dominant one .",
    "as usual , @xmath31 denotes the mean magnitude .",
    "pup , w  cyg and x  cam as function of time . ]",
    "first we show the phase variations by plotting @xmath17 versus @xmath16 in fig.[l2phase ] .",
    "the fact that l@xmath0  pup and w  cyg are closer to the origin than x  cam is a simple consequence of their smaller light curve amplitudes ( proportional to @xmath32 ) .",
    "the interesting thing is the phase range covered by the stars .",
    "while x  cam was meandering over a fairly narrow range of about 2030@xmath33 , drawing a loosely defined arc in the phase plane , l@xmath0  pup went almost all around the full circle .",
    "we interpret this difference as evidence that in l@xmath0  pup , the changes in both amplitude and phase are close to random , almost as randomly as in w  cyg , which is centered on the origin .",
    "the intermediate nature of l@xmath0  pup is also apparent from the phase variations as functions of time ( fig .",
    "[ phases ] ) .",
    "x  cam s phase is very stable in time , with no sudden changes ; l@xmath0  pup has good phase stability over several thousand days but then some jumps occur . in contrast , w  cyg shows random phase variations on short time scales ( see howarth 1991 for further discussion of the phase changes in this star ) .",
    "the phase variations of x  cam are fully consistent with the @xmath1-mechanism , which by definition includes a phase coherent positive feedback from periodic opacity changes .",
    "the phase of w  cyg varies continuously , supporting the view that the oscillations are stochastically excited , presumably by convection .",
    "finally , l@xmath0  pupis an intermediate case .",
    "the phase fluctuations imply stochastic behaviour , but there may also be some driving from the @xmath1-mechanism .      could the seemingly complex pulsational behaviour of l@xmath0  pup be caused by a simple low - dimensional chaotic system ?",
    "recently , buchler et al . (",
    "2004 ) concluded that the irregular pulsations in some semiregulars are the result of the non - linear interaction of two strongly nonadiabatic pulsation modes , although they admitted that stochastic procedures may also affect the light curve shape to some extent .",
    "the first clear detection of chaos in a mira star was presented by kiss & szatmry ( 2002 ) , who demonstrated the chaotic origin of the amplitude modulation of r  cygni . here",
    "we employ the same non - linear tools of light curve analysis in order to yield insights into the dynamics of the pulsations in l@xmath0  pup . instead of using the whole dataset , we restricted the nonlinear analysis to the better - sampled two - thirds of the data , from jd  2435000 onwards .     a typical light curve segment with the smoothed and interpolated signal .",
    "]        we made the following pre - processing steps : 1 .",
    "long - term trend removal by subtracting a polynomial that was fitted to the binned light curve ; 2 .  smoothing and interpolating the resulting light curve .",
    "the first step was made to remove the long - term mean brightness variations that are caused by the increased dust extinction events and are not connected with pulsation ( paper  i ) .",
    "we experimented with different orders of polynomials and accepted 10 as the best one which followed quite well the sudden changes of the mean level . after subtracting the polynomial ,",
    "the residual light curve clearly showed the complex amplitude changes .",
    "further interpolating consisted of fitting akima splines to the data with the constant sampling rate of 10 days .",
    "the spline fit was smoothed with a gaussian weight - function with an fwhm of 20 days .",
    "we show a part of the final result in fig .",
    "[ fig.polyfit ] .",
    "the pre - processed light curve was submitted to our nonlinear analysis .",
    "the applied numerical tools and their basics have been described by hegger et al .",
    "briefly , we used time - delay embedding to reconstruct the phase space of the system .",
    "first , we estimated the embedding parameters , the optimal time - delay embedding dimension .",
    "we then calculated various projections to visualize the trajectories in the phase space .",
    "the existence of an attractor would produce regular structures , and finding these was the aim of the analysis .    as for r  cygni , the optimal delay was found to be between 1030% of the formal period . since the reconstructed images did not show strong dependence on the time delay , we adopted 50 days , corresponding to 5 steps in the dataset and about 30% of the mean period .",
    "we tried different embedding dimensions ( @xmath34 ) and the most informative images were found for @xmath34=4 . to visualize the embedded state vectors ,",
    "we have generated the broomhead - king projections ( broomhead & king 1986 ) , which project onto the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix .",
    "the most informative projections are shown in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig.bkproj ] . for comparison",
    ", we also show the same projections for a shorter dataset without long - term trend removal but with the same smoothing and interpolation procedure .",
    "this subset was chosen between jd 2440000 and jd 2450000 , when the mean brightness of l@xmath0  pup was fairly constant .",
    "both datasets yield the same result : there are no regular structures in the reconstructed phase space of l@xmath0  pup and the presence of an attractor can be safely excluded .",
    "the system is temporarily close to stable states from time to time ( as suggested by the circular structures in the first column of fig .",
    "[ fig.bkproj ] ) , but it then changes erraticly and the phase space projections become fuzzy clouds .",
    "we have checked this conclusion up to @xmath35 and the results did not change , producing only similar blurred structures in higher dimensions .",
    "we conclude that the complex light variations can not be explained by low - dimensional chaos .",
    "we also note that buchler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) made a somewhat extrapolative argument against stochasticity in semiregular variables . while criticizing konig et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for interpreting r  scuti s light curve in terms of stochastic damped oscillators , buchler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) rejected the idea as being meaningless on physical grounds , because no mechanism is proposed that could excite damped modes to such large amplitudes , like the factor of 40 in the light curve of r  sct ( i.e. that star s visual amplitude can reach 4 mags ) .",
    "furthermore , they also considered the energetics of a 0.7 m@xmath36 pulsation model with l=1000 l@xmath36 and t@xmath37=5300 k ( implying 37 r@xmath36 for model radius ) .",
    "their main argument was the fact that the model s average pulsational kinetic energies in alternating large and small amplitudes exceeded by a factor of two the average turbulent energies , so that even if all available turbulent energy were converted into pulsational kinetic energy , there is not enough energy .",
    "however , while this consideration might be true for r  sct , which is an rv  tauri type pulsating yellow supergiant , both the large amplitude in r  sct and the quoted model properties are highly irrelevant when considering pulsations in red giant stars .",
    "firstly , the visual amplitude of semiregular and mira stars are grossly enhanced by the extreme temperature sensitivity of molecular species in their much cooler atmospheres with typical temperatures around 3,0003,300 k. in addition , the visual range is in the wien - part of the spectrum for these stars , which also increases the amplitude s temperature sensitivity .",
    "for that reasons , infrared observations ( e.g. in k band ) draw a more reliable picture of their luminosity fluctuations .",
    "typical near - infrared amplitudes in semiregular stars are between 0.1 - 0.3 mag ( whitelock et al .",
    "2000 , smith 2003 ) , which means there is no need for any exotic mechanism to excite damped modes to large amplitudes . for l@xmath0  pup , the dirbe instrument on the cobe satellite measured less than 10% fluctuations at 2.2@xmath38 ( jura et al .",
    "2002 , schmidt 2003 ) , which is typical among mira - like semiregulars ( i.e. sra type srs ) .",
    "secondly , we feel that the applicability of a 5300 k model to 30003300 k stars must be limited and speculative .",
    "red giant stars can have luminosities and radii larger by up to a factor of ten , in which parameter region the properties of convection are not necessarily the same as in hotter and smaller stars .",
    "consequently , while buchler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented convincing evidence for low - dimensional chaos in three ( or maybe four ) semiregular stars , their arguments against stochastic excitation do not lie on firm physical basis .",
    "we therefore believe that stochastic ( solar - like ) oscillations offer the best explanation for the complex variability in l@xmath0  pup .",
    "jura et al .",
    "( 2002 ) cited the difference between 12@xmath38 m light curve and those at @xmath39 and @xmath40 for l@xmath0  pup as evidence that the pulsations are non - radial .",
    "smith ( 2003 ) also noted the intriguing difference between the shorter and longer wavelength infrared observations of the dirbe instrument , which was exceptional in a sample of 207 infrared sources .",
    "in particular , the maxima at 1.25@xmath38 m preceded those at 4.9@xmath38 m by 1020 days , while at 4.9@xmath38 m , there was a secondary peak between the two 1.25@xmath38 m maxima .",
    "also , the 2.2@xmath38 m and 3.5@xmath38 m light curves resembled the 1.25@xmath38 m curve , while the 12@xmath38 m curve was similar to that at 4.9@xmath38 m .",
    "the jura et al .",
    "hypothesis was based on the assumption that , while the 12@xmath38 m flux tracks the light emitted by the circumstellar dust , and hence measures the luminosity of the entire star , the near - infrared fluxes measure only emission from the hemisphere of the star that faces the earth .",
    "if there are differences then the photosphere must vary in time nonspherically , implying non - radial pulsation , which would also naturally explain the marked time variation of the position angle of the net polarization of the star ( magalhaes et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "however , as we have shown in paper i , the extinction - corrected @xmath40 band magnitude of l@xmath0  pup is very close to the value expected from the mira p ",
    "l relations .",
    "the good agreement tends to argue against the hypothetic nonradial pulsations ( unless one allows that miras also pulsate non - radially ) . the full velocity amplitude of 12 km  s@xmath7 ( lebzelter et al .",
    "2005 ) is also hardly compatible with non - radial oscillations , which are not expected to result in large radial velocity amplitudes ( wood et al .",
    "looking at dirbe light curves of mira stars , it is apparent that not only are there similar phase lags in mira stars ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , but also that small differences do exist between the near- and mid - infrared data .",
    "as discussed by smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , there are no theoretical models that predict these phase lags , because of the complexity of the problem .",
    "in addition to the pulsation - induced luminosity variations , the 12@xmath38 m light curve also reflects the dynamics of dust formation process which is governed by a time scale of its own ( winters et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , the dirbe observations were taken a few pulsation cycles before the beginning of the major dimming event in 1994 .",
    "it seems to be likely that at the time of the dirbe observations , there had already been some activity in dust formation , which can explain the extra features in the mid - infrared data without invoking non - radial pulsations .",
    "for example , soker ( 2000 ) examined the effects of magnetic cool spots , above which large quantities of dust are expected to form .",
    "alternatively , interactions with a close binary component ( but outside the agb envelope ) may yield a strong density contrast in the equatorial plane , with similar outcomes . while currently there is no evidence for binarity in l@xmath0  pup , ireland et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using optical interferomety , found evidence for highly clumpy structures in the circumstellar dust shell as close as the dust condensation radius .",
    "very recently , wood et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented observations that suggested large scale star spot activity in some semiregulars with long secondary periods .",
    "although l@xmath0  pup does not belong to that subclass of srs , we think that the soker ( 2000 ) model offers a more realistic mechanism to produce inhomogeneous dust and therefore different mid - infrared light curves in l@xmath0  pup than non - radial pulsations .",
    "l@xmath0  pup is a very interesting semiregular star .",
    "its light curve is dominated by two completely different mechanisms : gradual dimmings caused by circumstellar dust and pulsations .",
    "these two are completely independent , as we did not find any evidence for coupling between them .",
    "the present paper discussed properties of the pulsations , outlining the physical implications .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the long - term light curve shows a peak of power that is resolved into multiple peaks under a narrow envelope .",
    "this is consistent with stochastic excitation , as seen in solar oscillations .",
    "the mode life - time can be derived from the width of the envelope : for l@xmath0  pup this is found to be about 5 yr . the oscillation amplitude agrees roughly with the predictions of simple scaling laws , while the phase behaviour is markedly different from a mira star with the same pulsation period .",
    "the seemingly random amplitude and phase changes argue against excitation by the @xmath1-mechanism alone , although it might make some contribution .    a test for low - dimensional chaos ruled out the possibility of non - linear interactions of a few pulsation modes as the reason for seemingly irregular light variations .",
    "we also argued against the hypothesis of non - radial pulsations in l@xmath0  pup : the difference between the near- and mid - infrared data may only be related to clumpy dust production , possibly driven by spot activity .",
    "bedding ( 2003 ) has recently given examples of other semiregulars whose power spectra display similar evidence for solar - like oscillations .",
    "the inferred mode lifetimes range from a few years , as found in l@xmath0  pup , down to less than a year .",
    "it seems plausible that stochastic excitation , presumably from convection , plays an important  perhaps dominant  role in the behaviour of semiregular variables .",
