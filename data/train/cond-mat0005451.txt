    "it has been recognized that exotic magnetic excitations known as skyrmions may exist @xcite in a two - dimensional electron gas in a strong homogeneous magnetic field ( quantum hall system ) near spin polarized groundstates .",
    "these are excitations of a two - dimensional spontaneous ferromagnet , the physics of which is relevant to this system ( despite the presence of a strong magnetic field ) , because of the small land @xmath0-factor in gaas systems ( where most experiments take place ) , which makes the zeeman coupling very small compared to other energy scales ( coulomb interaction , cyclotron energy ) in the problem .",
    "skyrmions are spin configurations with a non - trivial winding number ( pontryagin index ) .",
    "they were first discussed in the context of four - dimensional field theories @xcite , and were later recognized as states occurring in the non - linear sigma model description of two - dimensional ferromagnets @xcite . for filling factors @xmath1 close to one ( @xmath2 is the number of electrons and @xmath3 the number of magnetic flux quanta penetrating the system ) , these turn out to be the lowest energy quasiparticles under typical experimental circumstances .",
    "skyrmions can thus be introduced into the groundstate by adding or removing charge from the system .",
    "@xcite .    experimentally , the case for the existence of skyrmions in a system close to @xmath4 is quite strong .",
    "nmr experiments show a degrading of the spin polarization with deviation of filling factor from one @xcite that is in remarkably good agreement with hartree - fock theory @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle spin measured in transport experiments @xcite are also reasonably well accounted for by hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic absorption experiments @xcite further support that doping away from @xmath4 injects skyrmions into the system .    in weaker magnetic fields , near filling factor @xmath5 , early experiments @xcite suggested that spin - polarized quasiparticles are lower in energy than skyrmions , so the effects seen near @xmath4 would not be present at higher filling .",
    "this is consistent with calculations of skyrmion energies near @xmath5 that include finite thickness corrections @xcite , which indicate that skyrmions will be present only at much smaller zeeman couplings than realized in typical experiments .",
    "the size of the skyrmion may be quantified by a number @xmath6 , the difference in the spin component @xmath7 between the skyrmion and the spin - polarized quasiparticle . because of the necessarily small zeeman coupling , stable skyrmions close to @xmath5 have large values of @xmath6 .",
    "they also become unstable with respect to spin - polarized quasiparticles at a finite value of @xmath6 .",
    "( for @xmath4 , @xmath8 as the zeeman coupling reaches the maximum value for which the system supports skyrmions ; i.e. , the skyrmion state smoothly goes into the spin - polarized quasiparticle state . ) for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with width of about 2@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the magnetic length , the minimum @xmath6 expected @xcite is approximately 4 .",
    "recently however , nmr experiments @xcite have uncovered evidence that some anomalous degrading of spin polarization @xmath11 occur as one dopes away from @xmath5 at relatively high zeeman couplings .",
    "these experiments further indicate that the number of overturned spins per quasiparticle is quite small , @xmath12 .",
    "the simple models usually considered @xcite are inconsistent with this , and one is naturally led to inquire as to what other ingredients might change the critical zeeman coupling and smallest @xmath6 observable near @xmath5 .",
    "two possible answers are landau level mixing and screening by filled landau levels . it should be noted that these are not distinct effects : screening by filled landau levels occurs because they may admix high ( unoccupied ) landau levels to smooth fluctuations due to external potentials and/or inhomogeneous electron densities in partially filled levels .",
    "conversely , the states which may be used for landau level mixing in a partially filled level are limited to those that are not occupied by electrons in other levels , due to pauli exclusion .",
    "thus , a correct treatment of either screening or landau level mixing near @xmath5 must include both these effects .    in this work",
    ", we present a method by which these may be incorporated into the hartree - fock description of skyrmion states .",
    "our principal conclusions may be summarized as follows : ( i ) for skyrmions near @xmath4 , landau level mixing tends to lower the quasiparticle energy , although not enough to quantitatively explain the activation energies seen in experiment @xcite .",
    "introduction of a finite width of one magnetic length lowers the energy of the skyrmion by approximately 40% , and inclusion of landau level mixing lowers the energy by approximately another 20% for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the cyclotron frequency of the electrons , and @xmath15 is the dielectric constant of the host crystal .",
    "the resulting quasiparticle gap is approximately a factor of 2 larger than what is found in experiment @xcite .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with that of another study of landau level mixing effects on @xmath4 skyrmions @xcite .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath4 , landau level mixing tends to suppress quasihole - like skyrmions ( i.e. , lowering the maximum zeeman coupling for which they are stable ) , while enhancing the stability of quasielectron ( anti-)skyrmions .",
    "( iii ) for @xmath5 and higher , we find that a sufficiently realistic model of the effective electron - electron interaction , as modified by the finite thickness of the electronic wavefunctions , is necessary to obtain reliable results .",
    "use of a simple potential due to zhang and das sarma @xcite grossly overestimates the stability of @xmath5 skyrmions ; more realistic potentials @xcite allow skyrmions only for very small zeeman couplings .",
    "( iv ) screening and landau level mixing for @xmath5 and @xmath16 tend to lower the energy of spin - polarized quasiparticles more than that of skyrmions , making the latter even less stable .",
    "( v ) the results of ref . can not be understood solely on the basis of hartree - fock states for skyrmions .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii below , we discuss the method used to allow screening and landau level mixing to be included in our calculations .",
    "section iii gives details of our results , and we conclude with a summary of our findings in section iv .",
    "most previous hartree - fock studies of skyrmions have relied on landau level representation of the single particle states @xcite .",
    "we choose instead to construct the wavefunctions in real space .",
    "this enables us to include in the model landau level mixing occurring in weak magnetic fields , without having to expand over the large number of landau levels necessary in the former approach .",
    "we thus trade the calculational convenience of working with the functions given in closed analytic form ( landau levels ) for a closer description of the single - particle states by representing them on a real - space grid .    in this calculation",
    "we aim to model all the participating particles , including the ones in the filled levels .",
    "our hartree - fock wavefunction is a slater determinant composed of single - particle states which have @xmath17 as a good quantum number @xcite but whose radial form is to be determined self - consistently : @xmath18 e^{im\\theta } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are polar coordinates , @xmath21 is the angular momentum quantum number , and @xmath22 labels different states of the same @xmath21 .",

    "the results we thus obtain will be largely presented as comparisons between energies of the spin - polarized quasiparticle and energies of the corresponding skyrmion .    to assess the energy of the skyrmion in the region of parameters where it is not stable , we add to the hamiltonian a term of the form @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the spin operator , and @xmath58 a tunable parameter .",
    "this term favors a state with total spin @xmath59 , but is insensitive to the detailed form of the wavefunctions .",

    "of particular importance is the slope ( negative slopes indicate that skyrmion is stable for some value of @xmath0 ) and the curvature ( concave curves will support small - sized skyrmions ) . for concave curves",
    "the largest zeeman splitting that supports skyrmions is the negative of the initial slope of the curve @xcite .    for large cyclotron energies our results",
    "are essentially identical to those obtained using the single landau level method @xcite .",
    "note the quasielectron and quasihole excitations are precisely degenerate in this case , due to particle - hole symmetry . for smaller values of @xmath65 ,",
    "the two curves split ; surprisingly , the quasihole skyrmion is suppressed by landau level mixing , whereas the quasielectron skyrmion is enhanced .",
