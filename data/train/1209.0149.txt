    "polymer melts and solutions exhibit interesting dynamical behavior . in particular",
    ", if the degree of polymerization is large , characteristic dynamical behavior due to the entanglement effect can be observed@xcite .",
    "for example , viscoelasticity with a very long relaxation time ( which strongly depends on the molecular weight ) and anomalous diffusion of a segment occur as a result of the entanglement effect",
    ". dynamics of entangled polymers have been studied extensively by various methods@xcite , including theoretical modeling and simulations .",
    "there are several characteristic time scales in entangled polymer systems , such as the entanglement time @xmath0 , the rouse time @xmath1 , and the disengagement time ( the longest relaxation time ) @xmath2 . in each characteristic time scale , mean square displacements ( msds ) show different scalings .",
    "for example , the doi - edwards tube model gives the following time dependence of the msd of a single segment@xcite : @xmath3^{2}\\rangle    \\propto \\begin{cases }   t^{1/2 } & ( t \\lesssim \\tau_{e } ) \\\\   t^{1/4 } & ( \\tau_{e } \\lesssim t \\lesssim \\tau_{r } ) \\\\",
    "t^{1/2 } & ( \\tau_{r } \\lesssim t \\lesssim \\tau_{d } ) \\\\",
    "t & ( \\tau_{d } \\lesssim t ) , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the position of the @xmath5-th segment at time @xmath6 and @xmath7 represents the ensemble average .",
    "anomalous diffusion of a single segment in the doi - edwards tube model originates from the following two mechanisms .",
    "one is a dynamical property of a single rouse chain .",
    "the msd of a segment of a rouse chain shows subdiffusive behavior , @xmath8^{2}\\rangle \\propto t^{1/2}$ ] , at the short time scale ( @xmath9)@xcite . the other is a constraint by a tube ( which is formed by surrounding chains ) .",
    "namely , each segment can move only along the tube , which has a fractal geometry similar to a random walk trajectory , thereby causing a subdiffusive transport characterized by the exponent @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "the subdiffusive exponent @xmath12 for @xmath13 results from the combination of these two mechanisms .",
    "thus , using the msd of a single segment , one can estimate @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that numerical prefactors in eq .",
    "( which are not explicitly shown ) depend on the index @xmath5 if the target segment is close to chain ends@xcite .",
    "( and if the strong @xmath5-dependence is observed , validity of eq .",
    "is no longer guaranteed . )",
    "although this does not cause serious problems for relatively fine - scale models ( such as the kremer - grest model@xcite ) , it may be crucial for highly coarse - grained models ( such as the rapid ( responsive particle dynamics ) model@xcite ) .",
    "in some coarse - grained models , resolutions of the models are not sufficient to resolve the msds of segments .",
    "therefore , for such coarse - grained models , it is physically reasonable to employ the msd of the center of mass ( cm ) of a chain , instead of that of a single segment .",
    "in contrast to the msd of a single segment , the msd of the cm is given by @xmath14^{2}\\rangle    \\propto \\begin{cases }   t & ( t \\lesssim \\tau_{e } ) \\\\",
    "t^{1/2 } & ( \\tau_{e } \\lesssim t \\lesssim \\tau_{r } ) \\\\",
    "t & ( \\tau_{r } \\lesssim t ) , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the position of the cm .",
    "we note that the scaling exponent in the msd of the cm does not change around @xmath16 . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is because the constraint by a tube apparently disappears by taking the average with respect to all segments .",
    "it seems to be difficult to extract an information of @xmath2 from the msd of the cm straightforwardly .    for highly coarse - grained models , thus",
    ", usually other physical quantities such as the shear relaxation modulus and the end - to - end vector relaxation function have been employed to determine the long time relaxation behavior .    however , it is not always easy to determine the long time relaxation behavior accurately .",
    "for example , to obtain the accurate shear relaxation modulus data , we need to compute the autocorrelation functions of stress tensors for large number of statistically independent samples .",
    "such calculation becomes demanding for interacting many chain models .",
    "the end - to - end vector relaxation function can be computed more accurately than the relaxation modulus , but some highly coarse - grained models such as the rapid model do not provide the information of end - to - end vectors . therefore , alternative methods to determine the long time behavior will be useful for some simulation models , and thus are worth developing . a simple but fascinating idea is to utilize some tools or methods developed in the fields other than polymer physics to analyze simulation data of entangled polymers .    in this work ,",
    "we employ a method which is originally developed in lvy statistics@xcite , to analyze the long time relaxation behavior of entangled polymers .",
    "recently , various theoretical tools have been developed for the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) model@xcite , which is a typical trap model .",
    "an interesting recent finding is that the distribution of the time - average msd ( tamsd ) can be utilized to characterize some dynamical properties@xcite .",

    "the relative fluctuation ( rf ) of the tamsd @xmath20 is useful for characterizing non - gaussian fluctuations and ergodicity breaking in diffusion processes@xcite .",
    "for the ctrw trajectories , by analyzing the @xmath6-dependence of the rf , we can determine some important information of the trapping - time distribution , such as the power - law exponent and relaxation time@xcite .",
    "although the ctrw is not equivalent to models for entangled polymers , the rfs in polymer systems may also characterize some long time relaxation behavior .",
    "if the rf analysis ( rfa ) works well for entangled polymers , it will serve as a new and complementary tool to study the long time relaxation behavior .",
    "as far as the authors know , such an analysis has never been performed for entangled polymer systems . in this work",
    "we perform the rfa for the cm trajectory data of entangled polymer models and show that the information of the long time relaxation behavior ( such as the longest relaxation time @xmath2 ) can be observed .",
    "therefore the rfa can be utilized as a new and complementary method .",
    "in this section , we perform simulations for entangled polymers and analyze msds of cms . so far ,",
    "various simulation models have been proposed and utilized to study entangled polymers@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we employ two simple models among them .",

    "first we perform simulations of the slip - spring model@xcite .",
    "the slip - spring model is a variant of slip - link models@xcite , which reproduce diffusive and rheological properties well . in the slip - spring model ,",
    "a polymer chain is described as an ideal chain and the entanglements are mimicked by so - called slip - springs .",
    "one end of a slip - spring is anchored in space while another end can slip along the chain .",
    "moreover , slip - springs are dynamically reconstructed at chain ends . this model can reasonably reproduce linear and nonlinear rheological properties , while it lacks some mechanisms such as the constraint release ( cr ) or the convective constraint release ( ccr)@xcite .",
    "we perform simulations for different numbers of beads ( polymerization indices ) @xmath22 .",
    "other parameters are set to be the standard values ; the average number of segments between slip - springs @xmath23 , the slip - spring strength @xmath24 , the friction coefficient of a slip - spring @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 being the friction coefficient of a segment ) . as elementary length and time scales of this model",
    ", we use the segment size @xmath27 and the characteristic time of a segment @xmath28 .",

    "thus information of two characteristic times , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , can be obtained . however , as we mentioned in section [ introduction ] , we can not obtain any information about @xmath2 from the eamsds for cms . here",
    "we perform the rfa of the tamsds for cms . as will be shown in appendix [ appendix_effect_of_time_interval_size_delta ]",
    ", it is difficult to obtain the rf accurately if @xmath19 is too small .",
    "also , if @xmath19 is too large , the rf shows only gaussian fluctuation .",
    "therefore , the time difference @xmath19 should be chosen to be some moderate values .",

    "fitting gives @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we will discuss this in section  [ discussions ] . )",
    "such behavior of @xmath39 seems to be consistent with the behavior of the longest relaxation time @xmath2 determined from the shear relaxation modulus@xcite .",
    "actually , the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath39 obtained from the rfa is quite similar to that of @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ slip_spring_relaxation_and_crossover_times ] ) . for @xmath44 , @xmath2 and @xmath39",
    "show the similar power - law type @xmath22 dependencies ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .    for @xmath40 ,",
    "the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath2 is close to one of unentangled polymers ( @xmath47 ) and in this region @xmath39 is not determined accurately ( see fig .",
    "[ slip_spring_tamsd_fluctuation_delta10](a ) ) .",
    "possibly , this implies that we can not extract the information about the long time relaxation behavior from the rfa if @xmath2 is comparable to or less than @xmath19 .",
    "similar trend is found in appendix [ appendix_effect_of_time_interval_size_delta ] .",

    "although several important mechanisms ( such as the constraint release)@xcite are not considered in this model , we believe that the incorporation of these mechanisms do not change the rf behavior of the tamsd qualitatively . therefore ,",
    "if it gives qualitatively the same result as the slip - spring model , we consider that the rfa can be applied to most of models for entangled polymers .    for simplicity",
    ", we employ the discrete version of the tube model .",

    "the number of polymer chains ( or tubes ) is @xmath31 for each simulation , and the initial state is sampled from an equilibrium distribution . because this model lacks the clf mechanism , the msd of the cm becomes the following form@xcite , instead of eq .",

    "both the slip - spring model and the discrete reptation model in section  [ simulation_results ] give qualitatively the same crossover behavior .    however , there are some differences between the rfa results of the slip - spring and discrete reptation models . for example",

    "we expect that the differences reflect the detailed relaxation mechanisms of models .",
    "( in the case of the ctrw , @xmath58 reflects some informations of traps@xcite . )",
    "the discrete reptation model is the simple model and the reptation is only the relaxation mechanism in the model . on the other hand , the slip - spring model has other relaxation mechanisms such as the rouse motion of subchains and the contour length fluctuation .",
    "the incorporation of additional relaxation mechanisms other than the reptation modulates several dynamical behavior@xcite . in the reptation model , the dynamic equation of the cm is described by using the end - to - end vector@xcite .",

    "therefore , even if various mechanisms which affect the relaxation behavior are incorporated , we expect that the rfa still gives the information about the long time relaxation due to the reptation .",
    "it should be pointed that several mechanisms such as the cr affect the longest relaxation time @xmath2@xcite .",

    "we shortly discuss the power - law exponent @xmath37 of the slip - spring model ( eq .  ) . as we have shown in section  [ slip_spring_model ] , it depends on @xmath22 .",
    "as far as the authors know , there is no relaxation mechanism which gives such @xmath22-dependent power - law exponent .",
    "therefore , it would be physically natural to interpret that this @xmath22-dependent power - law exponent is apparent . as we can observe in fig .",

    "the region where we have observed the power - law exponent @xmath37 is the transient region .",
    "if @xmath22 is relatively small , such a transient region is affected by the short time region , and the fitting may give apparent power - law exponent which is different from the true value .",
    "( this situation may be somewhat similar to the power - law for the longest relaxation time , @xmath62 , which is considered to be apparent behavior@xcite . )",
    "one advantage of the rfa is that it can be performed only with the cm trajectory data .",
    "as we mentioned , for some cases , the cm trajectory data are more suitable for the calculation of the long time relaxation behavior .",
    "the accurate computation of the stress autocorrelation functions in multi chain models is not easy . in highly coarse - grained models",
    "( such as the rapid model ) , the entangled polymers are modeled with very limited degrees of freedom , and some information such as the end - to - end vectors can not be calculated .",

    ", the rfa will not always be the optimal method , and other methods which utilize conventional quantities will be better for some cases .",
    "the rfa of the cm trajectories should be understood as a complementary method to conventional ones .",
    "here we note that in conventional methods to determine the longest relaxation time @xmath2 , dynamical quantities are utilized after the ensemble averages are taken . on the other hand , the rfa of the tamsds uses the time - averaged quantity before the ensemble average is taken .",
