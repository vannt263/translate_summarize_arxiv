    "in view of the construction of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and its detectors , there have been major efforts to develop ideas for what physics may lie beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this work is often motivated by a number of problems that still remain unsolved such as the hierarchy problem , baryogenesis and the origin of dark matter , among others .",
    "nevertheless , it is also possible that new physics is unrelated to the above phenomena and may show up in a way that is not predicted by existing theories . to ensure that such a physics does not go undiscovered requires precise understanding of how new physics will reveal itself in the next particle - physics experiments",
    "therefore , it is prudent to explore other approaches to studying new theories , with an emphasis in models with varied experimental signatures .    the hidden valley scenario @xcite has been proposed as an interesting example of physics beyond the sm that can profoundly affect future experiments at the lhc .",
    "a hidden valley refers to any new sector (  v - sector \" ) that is added to the sm with its own particles and interactions , neutral under the sm .",
    "a mass gap ensures that not all the particles in the v - sector decay to extremely - light , invisible particles .",
    "however , they can decay through the very weak interactions to the sm , often producing visible signals .",
    "hidden valleys can lead to interesting and unexpected collider phenomenology , including hidden states decaying macroscopic distances away from the primary interaction vertex , or unusual final states with a high multiplicity of sm particles ; see for example @xcite .",
    "hidden valleys have arisen in bottom - up models such as the twin - higgs and folded - susy models @xcite that attempt to address the hierarchy problem , and in a recent attempt to explain the various anomalies in dark - matter searches @xcite .",
    "they are also motivated by string compactifications : hidden sectors that are candidate hidden valleys often arise in many phenomenological string theory models which aim to come as close as possible to the minimal supersymmetric standard model , but typically have extra vector - like matter and extra gauge groups , see for example @xcite .",
    "so far various realizations of hidden valleys have been proposed , which can be generally categorized according to the matter content in the v - sector and the mechanism which communicates the interactions between the two sectors .",
    "an interesting class of hidden valleys is obtained by adding to the sm a v - sector which at low energy is a pure - yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath0 , a theory that has its own gluons ( `` v - gluons '' ) and their bound states ( `` v - glueballs '' )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the model contains some heavy matter fields @xmath1 , charged under both @xmath0 and sm gauge group , mediating the interaction between the sm and the v - sector . such states are called quirks in analogy to traditional quarks . without additional massless flavors in the v - sector , the gauge group @xmath0 is confining and the dynamics of the v - sector will develop a mass gap , slightly larger than the confining scale @xmath2 where the @xmath0 coupling gets strong .",
    "this scenario easily arises in many supersymmetric models with extended gauge groups beyond the standard model ; for example , in many supersymmetric v - sectors , supersymmetry breaking may lead to large masses for all matter fields .",
    "the spectrum of a pure yang - mills theory has been studied on the lattice for the case of a @xmath3 gauge group @xcite .",
    "these results are shown in figure [ spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum of stable bound states includes several glueballs with different quantum numbers @xmath4 .",
    "some of these glueballs have been studied in some detail in various contexts ; see for example  @xcite and a recent review  @xcite .",
    "the masses of the v - glueballs are determined by the confinement scale @xmath2 or , equivalently , the string tension @xmath5 through the relationship @xmath6 . for general @xmath7 gauge group , the leading large @xmath8 corrections to the glueball masses",
    "are of order @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the mass ratios in the general @xmath7 case will not differ substantially from the mass ratios shown in figure [ spectrum ] for @xmath10 .",
    "all of the v - glueballs shown are stable against decays to the other v - glueballs , due to kinematics and/or conserved quantum numbers .",
    "the v - glueballs are non - interacting with the sm particles , except for higher dimension operators in the effective lagrangian induced by the heavy mediators @xmath1 . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the possibility of operators between the v - sector and the higgs sector ( also referred to as the higgs portal ) , [ portal ] o_s^d - d(h^ , h ) o_v^(d ) where @xmath11 is the standard model higgs doublet ; @xmath12 is a heavy mass scale , associated with the masses of the heavy mediator fields .",
    "here we have split the dimension-@xmath13 operator into a standard - model part @xmath14 of dimension @xmath15 and a hidden - valley part @xmath16 of dimension @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath16 are constructed from gauge invariant combinations of v - gluon fields such as @xmath18 or @xmath19 , while the @xmath14 involve gauge invariant operators built out of the higgs field , such as @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "we will see that the lowest order term is given by the dimension - six operators of the form @xmath22",
    ". with some exceptions to be discussed below , most of the v - glueballs in figure [ spectrum ] can decay via the higgs portal interaction ( [ portal ] ) , with a strong dependence of the lifetimes on the confinement scale @xmath2 and the mass scale @xmath12 .",
    "loops of the heavy particles also induce dimension - eight effective interactions coupling the v - gluons to the standard model gauge bosons , either of the form @xmath23 or @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the field strength tensor for standard model ( hidden - valley ) gauge bosons .",
    "the field strength tensors are contracted according to different irreducible representations of the lorentz group .",
    "a detailed study of the phenomenology of these operators in the context of hidden valleys was carried out in  @xcite . in this case",
    "the v - glueball widths are dominated by decays into sm gauge - boson pairs , or radiative decays to another v - glueball and a photon ( or to a lesser extent a z boson ) , leading to jet and photon rich final states .    in this paper",
    ", we will first extend the results of  @xcite on v - glueball decays in pure - yang - mills theory to allow for higher dimension interactions of the form ( [ portal ] ) .",
    "we will need to compute the effective lagrangian coupling the v - gluons to the higgs sector .",
    "then we will use it to find formulas for the decay widths of the states in the spectrum shown in figure [ spectrum ] . specifically",
    ", we will find that the @xmath27 state can decay via the higgs portal to standard model particles with branching ratios which are determined by the couplings of the standard model higgs boson .",
    "other states can decay to a lighter state by emission of a higgs boson . for v - glueball states which can decay either through dimension - eight operators or through the emission of a higgs boson",
    "the situation is rather involved , with the relative branching ratios depending on the various parameters and the unknown v - glueball matrix elements .",
    "our primary motivation here is in the case where the lifetimes are short enough that at least a few v - glueball decays can be observed at the lhc detectors .",
    "this typically requires the lifetimes of the hidden particles to be shorter than a few micro - seconds , if the production cross - section is substantial .",
    "the key point in our scenario is that with different operators describing the decays , often competing with each other , we typically find a large spread in the lifetimes of the v - glueballs , even after all the parameters have been fixed .",
    "then there is no necessity to adjust any parameter to obtain short lifetimes .",
    "incidentally , our results are also relevant for studies of dark matter , either in the case of self - interacting dark matter  @xcite , where the v - glueballs would be the dark matter candidates , or indirectly , in a recent attempt to study scenarios of dark matter with novel signatures  @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce our model and describe the effective interactions coupling the two sectors .",
    "we also classify the matrix elements .",
    "section 3 presents our computation of the decay modes .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a summary of the different experimental constraints on the parameters of the model .",
    "then in section 5 we present our numerical estimates for the branching ratios .",
    "possible generalizations of the model are described in section 6 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 7 with a brief summary of our results and some comments .",
    "additional computations appear in the appendix .",
    "we first set up our framework and conventions .",
    "the generic scenario of hidden valleys with a pure - gauge hidden sector can be characterized as follows @xcite ,    * the sm is extended by the addition of an extra @xmath7 gauge group , with a mass scale scale @xmath28 in the @xmath29 range .",
    "we will refer to this sector as the hidden valley , or briefly the v - sector .",
    "there are no light flavours in the v - sector , so after confinement the lightest states in the spectrum are bound states of v - gluons , or v - glueballs .",
    "* there are heavy vector - like particles @xmath1 ( `` mediators '' ) that couple the v - sector very weakly to the visible sector at low energies . for definiteness",
    ", we will take the @xmath1 to transform as a fundamental representation of @xmath7 and in complete @xmath30 representations of the standard model .",

    "the coupling between the higgs sector and the v - sector to non - vanishing leading order in @xmath68 at low energies arises from a diagram with four external lines , as depicted in figure [ loops]a .",

    "as explained in section 3 , the v - glueballs can then decay via a loop of @xmath67 particles , producing photons , gluons , bottom quarks , and so forth . as will be seen in section 5",

    "present limits are in general very mild because the cross - section for production of quirks at the tevatron becomes very small once the quirk masses are larger than @xmath281 and because not all the collected data has been analyzed yet .",

    "this analysis by no means is exhaustive , but is meant to illustrate potential discovery signals and the bounds that can arise .",

    "second , motivated by a thermal model of fragmentation  @xcite , we have estimated the relative probability of producing any v - glueball in @xmath67-onium annihilations assuming production of the @xmath27 at @xmath287 , and that of the @xmath134 , @xmath143 and @xmath135 totaling @xmath288 in all . finally , for the purpose of obtaining an approximate bound we assume a @xmath289 efficiency for detecting v - glueballs .",
    "the last two assumptions are unlikely to be accurate , as we will discuss more thoroughly in our lhc study , but they are intended to give a rough estimate for the bounds .",
    "\\(i ) @xmath278 : the cdf collaboration has searched for the anomalous production of events containing a high - transverse momentum charged lepton and photon , accompanied by missing transverse energy  @xcite . using @xmath290 of cdf run ii data , these searches exclude @xmath67 masses below @xmath291 for color - singlet @xmath67 particles and @xmath292 for colored @xmath67 particles , under the assumption that the @xmath67-onium has lost most of its energy by radiation of photons and/or v - glueballs and the annihilation takes place at or near the ground state .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath293 and @xmath294 : the cdf collaboration has also searched for the inclusive production of diphoton events  @xcite . using @xmath295 of integrated luminosity , the diphoton plus third photon search places lower limits on the @xmath67 mass below @xmath291 for color - singlet @xmath67 particles and @xmath296 . the corresponding limit on the @xmath67 mass for colored @xmath67 particles turns out to be less severe , roughly below @xmath297 , because , in this case , the branching fraction to photons is @xmath298 .",
    "similarly , using @xmath299 , the diphoton plus tau search places lower limits on the @xmath67 mass for @xmath300 below @xmath292 for color - singlet @xmath67 particles and @xmath301 for colored particles .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "the mass bounds from potential v - glueball signals are necessarily model dependent .",
    "unfortunately , unlike our computations of the branching ratios , there is no way to make a reliable estimate of the probability for producing any given v - glueball state in @xmath67-onium annihilation , since phenomenological input from qcd is not relevant to the pure - glue case .",
    "v - glueballs could be created during the relaxation of @xmath67-oniums , and during their annihilation , so events with more than two v - glueballs might be common . generally , with more than two v - glueballs produced in each @xmath67-onium annihilation , events with multiple photons would be common and easier to observe . however , the events may be more cluttered and the energy of the photons lower , leading potentially to lower detection efficiencies . since we can not model this reliably , in the simple analysis of this paper",
    ", we will rely on the model independent bounds from the production of @xmath67-onium through @xmath150-channel @xmath302 outlined above .",
    "moreover , the bounds from the @xmath303 photon final state assume that the @xmath67-onium state decays to its ground state before annihilating .",
    "however , it has been argued in @xcite that the annihilation may often occur at higher energy , before the ground state is reached . with",
    "many @xmath67-onium states annihilating at different energies , the signal in the transverse mass distribution will be diluted .",
    "besides , annihilation to two fermions via an off - shell @xmath81 or to @xmath81 + v - glueballs becomes increasingly significant at higher energies .",
    "while the branching ratios to @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath81+v - glueballs can be estimated , the wide range of @xmath67-onium states and the uncertain annihilation probability as a function of the energy make any precise evaluation almost impossible .",
    "therefore , the tevatron limits are in fact weaker than suggested above .",
    "in passing , we note that the bounds on a fourth generation of particles from higgs searches at the tevatron do not apply to heavy fermions that get only part of their mass from electroweak symmetry breaking , such as the @xmath67 particles in our paper .",
    "for an additional pair of fermions that get most of their mass from electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs production cross - section @xmath306 is known to increase by a factor of roughly 9 , making a dramatic effect on higgs physics  @xcite .",
    "this allowed cdf and d0 to rule out fourth generation quarks for a higgs mass in the window @xmath307 .",
    "however , for heavy particles that get only part of their mass by electroweak symmetry breaking , their contribution to the cross - section @xmath306 decreases and the bounds are generally much weaker or absent .    before moving on to the discussion of electroweak precision constraints we should briefly comment on the possibility of producing v - glueballs in higgs decays .",
    "up to now we have considered the production of v - glueballs as a by - product of @xmath67-onium annihilation and relaxation .",
    "however , there is another possibility for this production to occur . for sufficiently small v - glueball masses , the interaction ( [ efflag ] )",
    "can also mediate processes such as @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "assuming only minor phase space suppression , the branching ratio to v - glueballs for a sm higgs below @xmath310 and @xmath311 is of order @xmath312 .",
    "this implies a cross - section for producing v - glueballs at the tevatron of order a few fb . even though the cross - section is small , when combined with @xmath67-onium annihilations , the production of v - glueballs in higgs decays may be useful in the low mass range @xmath313 .",
    "the produced v - glueballs can then decay to a wide variety of final states , including @xmath314 quarks , @xmath283 leptons , and multiple photons , among others ; for small v - glueball masses , a significant fraction of these decays may occur with displaced vertices . at the tevatron , there may be potential to observe a few events in the @xmath315 or @xmath316 channels , although with limited statistics . in the case of displaced vertices ,",
    "the d0 collaboration has searched for pair production of neutral long - lived particles decaying to a @xmath317 pair , and found no significant excess above the background  @xcite .",
    "this search could only exclude branching fractions of order 1 , so that in our case it does not imply any bounds . at the lhc ,",
    "the background problem is more severe , but with a larger cross - section and a larger integrated luminosity than at the tevatron , the observation of a few v - glueball events may also be possible . depending on kinematics , the case of photons that originate away from the primary interaction point may also play an interesting role .",
    "a search for displaced photons has been done at d0  @xcite , and may be possible at atlas , due to the longitudinal structure of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "besides , cdf and cms allow the identification of delayed photons from long - lived particles using ecal timing information ( see @xcite for results obtained using the cdf detector ) .",
    "the question then is whether at a rate @xmath318 the lhc will have some sensitivity . keeping these non - standard",
    "higgs decays in mind we leave the analysis of the discovery reach for future work .",
    "if new heavy particles exist , they can manifest in the standard model in terms of corrections to the gauge - boson self - energies .",
    "when the new physics scale is much larger than @xmath319 , this effect can be described by just three parameters @xmath320 at the one - loop level  @xcite : and @xmath96 which are both vacuum polarization functions with the operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 in ( [ eff_lag full2 ] ) ]    [ peskin - s ] s = 16 _ q^2=0 , [ peskin - t ] t = , u = 16 _ q^2=0 , where @xmath321 is the mass of the @xmath81 , and @xmath322 .",
    "the subscripts 1 and 3 refer to the weak @xmath33 currents , while @xmath323 denotes the electromagnetic current . in practise , only the @xmath95 and @xmath96 parameters are relevant for our work because the @xmath324 parameter is suppressed by an extra factor of the heavy fermion masses .",
    "these parameters are a measure of the size of electroweak breaking , which is parametrized by the breaking scale @xmath325 . on the other hand , they must be suppressed by the mass scale @xmath12 in the limit @xmath326 .",
    "therefore even if one introduces heavy fermions with extremely large couplings , their contributions to the @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath324 parameters can become small at least in the limit @xmath327 .",

    "firstly , we analyze the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , which is the simplest extension of the standard model higgs sector , and secondly , we study the possibility of @xmath63 violation in the theory and its implications for v - glueball decays",
    ". we will not attempt to systematically compute all the decay rates , but simply point out a few salient features of these extensions .",
    "as in the mssm , we consider the sm with two higgs doublets @xmath511 and @xmath512 , where @xmath511 only couples to up - type quarks and neutrinos and @xmath512 only couples to down - type quarks and leptons . in this model , there are five physical higgs bosons : two charged scalars ( @xmath513 ) ; two neutral scalars ( @xmath11 and @xmath77 ) ; and a neutral @xmath63-odd scalar ( @xmath514 ) .",
    "the presence of the @xmath63-odd scalar @xmath514 is of particular interest .",
    "since the @xmath514 is @xmath63-odd , a gauge invariant @xmath63-conserving coupling to the v - gluons must be of the form @xmath515 , with @xmath516 .",
    "because of this coupling , new possible decays of the pseudoscalar @xmath143 state emerge in the 2hdm . these are @xmath517 for all other v - glueballs , there are new contributions to their decays in the 2hdm , but the decay pattern as described in sections 3 and 5 remains basically unchanged . for the @xmath27 v - glueball ,",
    "the new channels include @xmath518 as well as the off - shell higgs decay @xmath423 . for all other states ,",

    ", we will need to find the effective lagrangian .",

    "the next operators in the expansion around the higgs vev contain one or two powers of the higgs field .",
    "their contribution to the electric dipole moment of the neutron can be estimated using naive dimensional analysis  @xcite . following the analysis of  @xcite",

    "we have focused on the effect of dimension - six operators by which the hidden sector interacts with the standard model through the higgs sector .",
    "the resulting v - glueball phenomenology is fairly complex in this scenario , but there are some simple features . in particular , we find the following interesting signatures :    * decays of the @xmath27 v - glueball through @xmath566 , producing any of the kinematically - allowed higgs final states such as @xmath317 , @xmath567 , @xmath235 , etc . *",

    "be determined by additional lattice computations .",
    "if the v - sector gauge group is not @xmath7 , some of the v - glueballs may not be present ; for instance , for @xmath570 or @xmath571 gauge groups the @xmath61-odd sector is absent or heavy .",
    "however , as explained in @xcite , the lightest @xmath61-even v - glueballs are expected to be present in any pure - gauge theory , with similar production and decay channels , so at least for them , the basic features of a pure - gauge hidden valley are expected to be retained .",
    "we also have not considered higher - order corrections to the decay rates , and they should be taken into account when precise predictions are required .",
    "we have seen that the operators considered in this paper are not heavily constrained by current experimental searches or precision electroweak data , thus leaving ample parameter space to be explored by the next generation of hadron collider experiments .",

    "decays to bottom quarks and gluons often dominate , but they suffer from a huge multijet background . at the tevatron and at the lhc ,",
    "the v - glueballs are most likely to be found in searches for diphoton resonances in events with 2 photons plus jets or with 3 or more photons and possibly additional jets , or in searches for displaced decays to jet pairs , @xmath572 pairs , or photon pairs .",

    "<S> we consider the possibility that the higgs boson can act as a link to a hidden sector in the context of pure - glue hidden valley models . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the standard model is weakly coupled , through loops of heavy messengers fields , to a hidden sector whose low energy dynamics is described by a pure - yang - mills theory . </S>",
    "<S> such a hidden sector contains several metastable hidden glueballs . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we shall extend earlier results on hidden valleys to include couplings of the messengers to the standard model higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> the effective interactions at one - loop couple the hidden gluons to the standard model particles through the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> these couplings in turn induce hidden glueball decays to fermion pairs , or cascade decays with multiple higgs emission . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of effective operators of different mass dimensions , often competing with each other , together with a great diversity of states , leads to a great variability in the lifetimes and decay modes of the hidden glueballs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the operators considered in this paper are not heavily constrained by precision electroweak physics , therefore leaving plenty of room in the parameter space to be explored by the future experiments at the lhc .    </S>",
