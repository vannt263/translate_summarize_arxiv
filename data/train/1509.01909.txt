    "the role of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) as dust producers is a fundamental issue for understanding the evolution history of dust in the universe .",
    "recent far - infrared observations of young supernova remnants ( snrs ) revealed that 0.11 @xmath4 of dust had formed in the metal - rich inner ejecta ( sibthorpe et al .",
    "2010 ; barlow et al .  2010 ; gomez et al .  2012 ; matsuura et al .  2011 , 2015 ; indebetouw et al .",
    "however , it remains to be clarified what fraction of these newly formed grains can survive the destruction in the shock - heated gas within the snrs and be injected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the destruction efficiency of dust grains depends on their chemical compositions and size distributions ( e.g. , nozawa et al .",
    "2007 ) , which are determined by the density and temperature evolution of the gas out of which they form ( nozawa & kozasa 2013 ) as well as the degree of mixing and clumpiness of the ejecta ( nozawa et al .  2003",
    "; sarangi & cherchneff 2015 ) .",
    "therefore , the physical condition and structure of the sn ejecta must be fully appreciated through various approaches to unravel the properties of dust that is formed in the ejecta and is finally ejected to the ism .",
    "presolar grains , which are identified in meteorites due to their highly anomalous isotopic compositions , are invaluable fossils that enable us to directly observe the detailed chemical compositions and sizes of stellar dust ( clayton & nittler 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "their isotopic signatures give clues about nucleosynthesis in stars and mixing of elements in the sn ejecta .",
    "in addition , the measured sizes of presolar grains could offer key information on the physical conditions at their formation sites .    among the presolar grains which are considered to have originated in sne , al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are of great importance because al@xmath0o@xmath1 is believed to be one of the major dust components in cassiopeia a ( cas a ) snr ( douvion et al .",
    "2001 ; rho et al .",
    "furthermore , most of the dust formation calculations have predicted the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains in the ejecta of sne as the first condensate among oxide grains ( kozasa et al .",
    "1989 , 1991 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2008 , 2010 ; bianchi & schneider 2007 ; kozasa et al .",
    "2009 ; sarangi & cherchneff 2015 ) . however , the calculated sizes of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are below @xmath50.03 @xmath2 m , which is much smaller than the measured sizes of presolar al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains with 0.5 @xmath2 m to 1.5 @xmath2 m in diameter ( nittler et al .  1998 ; choi et al .",
    "1998 ) , and such small al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are found to be almost completely destroyed in the hot gas within the snrs before being ejected to the ism ( nozawa et al .  2007 ;",
    "silvia et al .  2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "this seems to contradict the fact that we are observing the al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains of a sn origin in hand on the earth .",
    "one of the main reasons that only small al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are produced in the simulations is the low number density of al atoms in the ejecta , led by the relatively homogeneous ejecta of spherically symmetric sn models ( hereafter referred to as 1-d sn models ) . in reality",
    ", the sn ejecta should be much more inhomogeneous and complicated , as is suggested from multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , kifonidis et al .",
    "2003 ; hammer et al .  2010",
    "; joggerst et al .",
    "2010 ) and various observations of sn 1987a ( e.g. , kjr et al .  2010 ; larsson et al .",
    "this implies that the formation of dust grains would proceed in the gases with a variety of densities , and that large grains could be formed in high - density clumps .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains for wide ranges of density and cooling rate of gas , to explore the formation condition of presolar al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains as large as measured in meteorites .",
    "we show that submicron - sized al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains can be produced only in the gas with more than ten times higher densities than those predicted by 1-d sn models , suggestive of the presence of dense gas clumps in the ejecta .",
    "we also examine the survival of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains against the destruction process in snrs .",
    "we propose that the comparison between the calculated sizes and the measured sizes of presolar grains can be a novel and valuable approach that gives insight into the physical conditions and structure of the sn ejecta .",
    "the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains is calculated by applying the formula of non - steady - state dust formation in nozawa & kozasa ( 2013 ) . in this formula ,",
    "the formation of small clusters and the growth of grains are self - consistently followed under the consideration that the kinetics of dust formation process is controlled by collisions of key species , defined as the gas species that have the lowest collisional frequency among the reactants .",
    "the formula leads us to derive the size distribution and condensation efficiency of newly formed grains , given chemical reactions for the formation of clusters , abundances of the relevant gas species , and time evolutions of gas density and temperature .",
    "the detailed prescription of the calculations of non - steady dust formation is given in nozawa & kozasa ( 2013 ) .",
    "in the ejecta of sne , the most likely formation site of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains is the o - rich layer , where al atoms , as well as o atoms , abundantly exist .",
    "we consider as a chemical reaction at cluster formation 2al + 3o @xmath6 al@xmath0o@xmath1 ( kozasa et al .",
    "1989 ) . the initial number ratio of al to o atoms is taken as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the number densities of al and o atoms at a given initial time @xmath10 , so that the key species are al atoms .",
    "this abundance ratio approximately corresponds to that in the al - rich region of solar - metallicity sne ( see , e.g. , kozasa et al .",
    "2009 ; nozawa et al .",
    "note that the results of calculations are little affected by the al / o ratio as long as @xmath11 .",
    "the ejecta of sne freely expands since @xmath121 day post - explosion , and the gas density is inversely proportional to the cube of time @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the number density of a gas species @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is al or o ) , without the depletion of the gas - phase atoms due to the formation of clusters and grains , is given by @xmath16 as in nozawa & kozasa ( 2013 ) , the gas temperature @xmath17 is assumed to decrease as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gas temperature at @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a free parameter that prescribes the cooling rate .",
    "cccc 18.4788 & 45.3542 & 1.718 & 690    as the gas cools down , the formation of dust from gas can be realized in a supersaturated state ( @xmath22 ) ; @xmath23 is the supersaturation ratio defined as @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath26 the change of the chemical potential per key species for the formation of bulk condensate from the reactants , as is fomulated in equation ( 30 ) in nozawa & kozasa ( 2013 ) .",
    "here we take @xmath20 as a time at which @xmath27 and determine @xmath19 for given @xmath8 and @xmath9 from the equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the change of the chemical potential at the standrad pressure @xmath30 and is approximated as @xmath31 with the numerical values @xmath32 and @xmath33 taken from nozawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( see table 1 ) .    in this study , we suppose the clusters containing more than 100 al atoms as bulk grains .",
    "this corresponds to the minimum grain radius of @xmath34   ( al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are assumed to be spherical ) .",
    "the sticking probability of gas species is assumed to be unity for any sizes of clusters and grains . in the calculations , we take @xmath35 days , so the free parameters are @xmath8 and @xmath21 , for which we consider the ranges of @xmath8 = @xmath36@xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 1.11.7 .",
    "the calculations are performed until the gas density becomes so low that grain growth is negligible . in what follows",
    ", we mainly examine the resultant behavior of the final average radius @xmath40 and condensation efficiency @xmath41 that are obtained at the end of the calculations .",
    "the condensation efficiency is defined as the fraction of al atoms locked up in al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains .",
    "figure 1 shows the size distributions of newly formed al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains calculated for @xmath42 , adopting @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 @xmath38 . for these cases ,",
    "all al atoms are finally locked up in al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains ( that is , @xmath46 ) . as seen from the figure ,",
    "the size distribution is lognormal - like for any of @xmath8 considered here , with a narrower width for a higher @xmath8 .",
    "more importantly , the average radius increases with increasing @xmath8 : @xmath47 , 0.047 , and 0.36 @xmath2 m for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "this is because a higher gas density leads to more efficient growth of grains .",
    "the results in figure 1 point out that , for @xmath42 , the number density of al atoms at dust formation must be higher than @xmath12@xmath48 @xmath38 in order that al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains with the radii larger than 0.25 @xmath2 m ( @xmath490.5 @xmath2 m in diameter ) can be formed .",
    "nozawa & kozasa ( 2013 ) demonstrated that the formation process of dust grains is described in terms of the timescales of two physical quantities : the timescale with which the supersaturation ratio @xmath23 increases @xmath50 and the collision timescale of key species @xmath51 .",
    "they found that , for c and mgsio@xmath1 grains , the average radius and condensation efficiency are universally scaled by one non - dimensional quantity @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the onset time of dust formation ( @xmath54 and is taken as a time at which the condensation efficiency reaches @xmath55 . according to their study ,",
    "it would be interesting to see if such a scaling relation holds for al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains .",
    "figure 2 depicts the average grain radii @xmath40 and condensation efficiencies @xmath41 obtained from the calculations with a variety of @xmath8 for each of @xmath56 , 1.3 , 1.5 , and 1.7 , as a function of @xmath3 . in the present study , @xmath3 is approximately written as ( nozawa & kozasa 2013 ) @xmath57 \\left [ \\frac{t(t_{\\rm on})}{2000 ~ { \\rm k } } \\right]^{\\frac{3}{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure 2 clearly shows that the results for different @xmath21 are well overplotted , indicating that both @xmath40 and @xmath41 are uniquely determined by @xmath3 even for al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains .",
    "as is the cases of c and mgsio@xmath1 grains , the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains can be realized at @xmath58 12 , and @xmath46 at @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , @xmath40 becomes large as @xmath3 increases , which means that the final average radius is larger for a higher gas density and/or a slower gas cooling because @xmath3 is roughly proportional to the product of gas density and cooling timescale that is reflected by @xmath53 .    in figure 2",
    ", we also plot the ranges of @xmath3 expected in the ejecta of type ii - p and iib sne , referring to 1-d sn models used in kozasa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and nozawa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , respectively . for a type ii - p sn with the massive hydrogen envelope ,",
    "the number density of al atoms in the al - rich region is estimated to be @xmath60 ( 0.28 ) @xmath61 @xmath38 at @xmath62 days . for @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "k , this corresponds to @xmath65 703000 , for which @xmath66 0.0020.03 @xmath2 m . on the other hand , for a type iib sn with the small - mass envelope , @xmath60 ( 0.35 ) @xmath67 @xmath38 at @xmath62 days , resulting in @xmath65 0.12",
    "hence , al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are not expected to form in the type iib sn .",
    "nozawa et al .  ( 2010 ) reported the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains in the type iib sn but their average radii are less than @xmath58  , which is regarded as small clusters in this study .",
    "our calculations show that , in order to produce al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains larger than 0.25 @xmath2 m ( diameter of @xmath680.5 @xmath2 m ) as measured for presolar grains , @xmath3 should be higher than @xmath69 .",
    "given that @xmath21 and @xmath70 do not change largely , such a high @xmath3 could be achieved by considering the gas densities that are more than one order of magnitude higher than those presented by 1-d sn models ( namely , @xmath71 @xmath38 at @xmath62 days , see equation ( 4 ) ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the discovered presolar al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains were formed in dense clumps within the ejecta .",
    "equation ( 4 ) tells us that the formation of large al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains may also be possible if the formation time of dust is later than @xmath72 days .",
    "however , it is too hard to keep the gas density as high as @xmath73 @xmath38 in such late epochs because the gas density rapidly decreases with time ( see equation ( 2 ) ) .",
    "we have systematically investigated the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains , adopting a wide variety of gas densities and cooling rates .",
    "we show that , as in the cases of c and mgsio@xmath1 grains , the average radius and condensation efficiency of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are nicely scaled by a non - dimensional quantity @xmath3 defined as the ratio between the timescale of the supersaturation ratio and the collision timescale of key species at dust formation .",
    "we also find that large al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains with radii of @xmath490.25 @xmath2 m can be formed only in dense gas regions which have more than ten times higher densities than those estimated from 1-d sn models .",
    "this points out the presence of dense clumps in the ejecta of core - collapse sne .",
    "the formation of dust in dense clumps was deduced from various early - phase ( @xmath741000 days after explosion ) observations of sn 1987a ( e.g. , lucy et al .  1991 ; meikle et al .  1993 ; colgan et al .",
    "1994 ) , which can be classified as a type ii - p sn .",
    "the recent radiative transfer models of dust emission and absoption also suggested the necessity of optically thick clumps to account for the evolution of optical to infrared emission from sn 1987a over @xmath56009000 days ( ercolano et al .  2007 ; wesson et al .",
    "2015 ; dwek & arendt 2015 ; bevan & barlow 2015 ) .",
    "the density contrast between the clumps and interclumps considered by these works is @xmath510100 , which is in good agreement with the density enhancement needed for the formation of large al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains ( i.e. , more than ten time that of 1-d sn models ) .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the measured size of presolar grains is an independent and useful probe to constrain the clump density in the ejecta .",
    "our calculations show that al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains can not form in type iib sne as a result of the too low ejecta density in the 1-d sn model .",
    "however , the analyses of infrared emission spectra of cas a , which was identified as type iib through the light echo ( krause et al .",
    "2008 ) , have suggested the presense of newly formed al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains ( douvion et al .",
    "2001 ; rho et al .",
    "this contradiction can also be resolved by considering the dense gas clumps in the ejecta ; from figure 2 , we can estimate that the density of gas clumps required for the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains ( that is , @xmath75 ) is more than ten times that of the 1-d type iib sn model .",
    "we also note that the recent observation of near - infrared extinction implies the existence of large ( @xmath490.1 @xmath2 m ) si grains in cas a , providing another indication of dust formation in dense clumps ( lee et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "next we discuss the survival of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains formed in the ejecta against the destruction by sn shocks on the basis of a dust evolution model in snrs ( nozawa et al .",
    "this model assumes a spherically symmetry shock but it has been shown that the destruction efficiency of dust is not greatly different from those by multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ( silvia et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) . as the initial condition of the ejecta , we here consider the core - envelope structure of @xmath76 @xmath77 ( implicitly assuming type ii - p sne ) .",
    "the other input parameters are the explosion energy and the gas density in the ism , for which we take reasonable values of @xmath78 erg and 1.0 @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the result of the calculation is given in figure 3 , which shows that small grains with the initial radii of @xmath79 @xmath2 m are completely destroyed in the shocked gas .",
    "grains with 0.02 @xmath2 m @xmath80 @xmath2 m are eroded in the hot gas and are finally destroyed as soon as they encounter the cool dense shell that is formed behind the forward shock after @xmath81 years . on the other hand ,",
    "al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains with @xmath82 0.2 @xmath2 m can be ejected from sne without reducing their size significantly .",
    "this simple calculation illustrates that , once large al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains are produced in dense clumps , they are likely to survive the destruction in snrs and to be easily transported to the ism .",
    "thus , we suggest that the formation of submicron - sized al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains in dense clumps is also indispensable in order that newly formed al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains can endure the destruction by shocks and be incorporated into nearby molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks .    the identification of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains as a sn origin comes from their relatively high @xmath83o/@xmath84o ratio ( so - called group 4 grains , nittler et al .",
    "1997 ; choi et al .",
    "1998 ) or large enrichment of @xmath84o ( represented by grain t84 , nittler et al .  1998 ) . since we consider the formation of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains in the o - rich layer where @xmath84o is rich , they may be categorized as t84-like grains ( or group 3 grains with the moderate enhancement of @xmath84o ) . on the other hand , to explain the @xmath83o - enriched composition of group 4 grains , the extensive mixing between different layers in the ejecta",
    "is invoked with the relatively @xmath83o - rich hydrogen envelope being the dominant component ( nittler et al .",
    "however , even if the large - scale mixing takes place , the molecular diffusion lengths are much smaller than the typical size of gas clumps so that the microscopic mixing of elements may be very ineffective ( deneault et al .",
    "therefore , the origin of oxygen isotopic composition of the group 4 al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains , as well as their formation process , is still a challenging problem .",
    "we conclude that dense gas clumps are necessary for the formation of submicron - sized al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains as discovered in meteorites .",
    "the presence of such dense clumps in the o - rich layer may also cause silicate grains to be formed with very large radii , compared to those based on 1-d sn models .",
    "given that the radii of silicate grains are generally larger than those of al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains by a factor of about ten ( e.g. , nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ) , the discovery of @xmath84o - enriched micron - sized ( @xmath5110 @xmath2 m ) silicate grains in meteorites will serve as further evidence for dense clumps in the sn ejecta .",

    "<S> this indicates that presolar al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains identified as a sn origin might be formed in dense gas clumps , allowing us to propose that the measured sizes of presolar grains can be a powerful tool to constrain the physical conditions in which they formed . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss the survival of newly formed al@xmath0o@xmath1 grains against the destruction in the shocked gas within the sn remnants . </S>"
