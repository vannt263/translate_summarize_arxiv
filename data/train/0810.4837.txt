    "considerable progress has recently been achieved in the understanding of the mott transition in a variety of transition metal oxides.@xcite whereas density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) predicts many of these materials to be metallic , the explicit treatment of local coulomb interactions via dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite correctly yields insulating behavior for realistic values of the on - site coulomb energy @xmath0 . in the metallic phase , the non - cubic structure of some of these systems gives rise to non - equivalent , partially filled subbands that are split by a crystal field and exhibit orbital dependent electron occupancies .",
    "the hallmark of the mott transition of these oxides is that orbital polarization can be greatly increased by coulomb correlations and that the insulating phase is nearly completely orbitally polarized .",
    "for instance , in the case of latio@xmath1 , the @xmath2 bands are pushed above the fermi level and the remaining singly occupied @xmath3 subband is split into lower and upper hubbard bands.@xcite in the case of v@xmath4o@xmath1 , coulomb correlations push the @xmath3 band above the fermi level , and the doubly degenerate @xmath2 subbands exhibit a mott gap.@xcite also , in the insulating phase of ca@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , the @xmath6 like band is completely filled and the @xmath7 like subbands are split into hubbard bands.@xcite the common feature of the mott transition in these materials is that the effective band degeneracy is reduced from three to two or one , so that the critical coulomb energy is lower than it would be if the @xmath8 bands were fully degenerate . on the other hand , other materials can exhibit a quite different behavior .",
    "for instance , orbital polarization in bavs@xmath1 was shown to decrease with increasing local coulomb interaction.@xcite also , the mott transition in lavo@xmath1 and yvo@xmath1 occurs before orbital polarization is complete.@xcite moreover , in a hypothetical tetragonal structure of latio@xmath1 , relevant for heterostructures , the mott phase is reached when @xmath9 approaches @xmath10 and @xmath11 vanishes.@xcite finally , the possibility of so - called orbital selective mott transitions in multi - band systems has been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "@xcite these different trends underline the remarkably rich physics of mott transitions in multi - orbital materials .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the relationship between coulomb correlations in single - site multi - orbital systems as described above to those occurring within a single band when inter - site coulomb correlations are taken into account .",
    "the influence of short - range correlations on the nature of the mott transition is currently of great interest and has been studied by many groups .",
    "here we examine the role of correlation driven orbital polarization in the vicinity of the mott transition .",
    "for example , it is well known that in a minimal two - site cluster model , @xcite which permits explicit treatment of short - range coulomb correlations in an isotropic square lattice , the green s function and self - energy become diagonal if one transforms the site basis to a diagonal bonding - antibonding molecular orbital basis . in a four - site cluster model ,",
    "diagonality is obtained by transforming sites to cluster molecular orbitals characterized by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14.@xcite the molecular orbital components of the self - energy provide qualitative information on the importance of correlations in the corresponding sections of the brillouin zone . in the case of an isotropic triangular lattice , green s function and self - energy can be diagonalized by an analogous transformation to molecular orbitals appropriate for a three - site cluster.@xcite the question then arises whether these cluster molecular orbitals in the single - band case obey a similar scenario as the multi - orbital systems mentioned above .",
    "since an approximate momentum variation of the lattice self - energy in these models can be derived from a linear superposition of the respective molecular orbital components of the cluster self - energy , the effect of correlation enhanced orbital polarization is of direct relevance for the question of whether the mott gap opens uniformly across the fermi surface , or whether it opens first in certain regions of the brillouin zone ( e.g. near the so - called hot spots ) and only at larger @xmath0 in the remaining regions ( the so - called cold spots ) .",
    "the latter picture would be analogous to the orbital selective mott transition which can occur within single - site dmft treatments of certain multi - band systems . @xcite another possibility , analogous to multi - orbital materials such as latio@xmath1 , v@xmath4o@xmath1 , and ca@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , is that a subset of cluster orbitals could exhibit a genuine mott transition , while the remaining ones are pushed above or below the fermi level at about the same critical @xmath0 .    to account for inter - site correlations we use dmft combined with finite temperature exact diagonalization ( ed).@xcite it was recently shown@xcite that this method can be generalized to multi - band materials by computing only those excited states of the impurity hamiltonian that are within a narrow range above the ground state , where the boltzmann factor provides the convergence criterion . exploiting the sparseness of the hamiltonian",
    ", these states can be computed very efficiently by using the arnoldi algorithm.@xcite higher excited states enter via green s functions which are evaluated using the lanczos method .",
    "this approach has proved to be highly useful for the study of strong correlations in several transition metal oxides .",
    "@xcite an important feature of ed / dmft is that low temperatures and large coulomb energies can be reached .",
    "the adaptation of single - site multi - orbital ed to multi - site single - band systems is discussed in detail below .",
    "in particular , we introduce a mixed site - molecular orbital basis which permits a more flexible and more accurate projection of the lattice green s function onto the cluster than in a pure site representation .",
    "previous multi - site ed / dmft studies focussed on @xmath15.@xcite the extension to finite @xmath16 discussed here is especially useful for the evaluation of the @xmath17 phase diagram .",
    "the main result of this work is that in all cluster models studied here for half - filled square and triangular lattices , there is little enhancement of orbital polarization in the vicinity of the mott transition .",
    "thus , despite sizable level splitting between these cluster orbitals , they all exhibit mott gaps at the same critical coulomb energy . as a consequence ,",
    "the mott gap in these models opens uniformly across the fermi surface .",
    "for the square lattice we show explicitly that the mott gap at the cold spot @xmath18 of the brillouin zone is driven by coulomb correlations at the hot spot @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , there is no orbital selective mott transition .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence for the combination of partial band filling and mott transition in remaining subbands that is characteristic of single - site dmft treatments of the multi - orbital materials latio@xmath1 , v@xmath4o@xmath1 , and ca@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , as mentioned above .",

    "section ii discusses the theoretical aspects of our cluster ed / dmft implementation of finite temperature exact diagonalization .",

    "iv we briefly discuss analogies and differences between these multi - site correlation effects and those investigated previously in single - site dmft treatments of multi - orbital materials .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "let us consider the single - band hubbard model @xmath20 where the sum in the first term extends over nearest neighbor sites . the hopping integral @xmath21 will be set equal to unity throughout this paper .",

    "is given by @xmath24 where the @xmath25 sum extends over the reduced brillouin zone , @xmath26 are matsubara frequencies and @xmath27 is the chemical potential .",
    "the lattice constant is unity .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the hopping matrix for the superlattice and @xmath29 represents the cluster self - energy matrix . to make contact to other recent works,@xcite we consider here the paramagnetic metal insulator transition .    in the site basis ,",
    "the green s functions for two - site , three - site and four - site clusters have the structure @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "site labels in the square lattice refer to @xmath34 and in the triangular lattice to @xmath35 .",

    "in the site bases , the corresponding self - energy matrices @xmath40 have the same symmetry properties as the green s functions .",
    "a key aspect of dmft is that , to avoid double - counting of coulomb interactions in the quantum impurity calculation , it is necessary to remove the self - energy from the cluster in which correlations are treated exactly .",
    "this removal yields the green s function @xmath41^{-1 } .",
    "\\label{g0}\\ ] ] these matrices also exhibit the symmetry properties specified above .    for the purpose of the ed calculations it is convenient to transform the site bases into molecular orbital bases in which the green s functions and self - energies become diagonal . for the two - site cluster ,",
    "molecular orbitals are given by the bonding - anti - bonding combinations @xmath42 .",
    "for the four - site cluster , they are formed by the plaquettes @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "finally , for the three - site cluster of the triangular lattice they can be written as : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in theses",
    "cluster molecular orbital bases , the above green s functions take the form @xmath50 the self - energies @xmath29 and green s functions @xmath51 can be diagonalized in the same fashion .",
    "we denote these elements as @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in the site basis ,",
    "the local density of states in the non - interacting limit is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "since we consider isotropic clusters , all sites are equivalent , so that @xmath57 coincides with the density of states @xmath58 . in the molecular orbital basis ,",
    "the density of states components @xmath59 have different shapes and different centroids , analogous to the crystal field split density of states components of many transition metal oxides .",
    "figure  1 shows these densities for the two - site and four - site clusters of the square lattice and the three - site cluster of the triangular lattice , as described above .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ g2]-[g4 ] ) , the cluster molecular orbital densities of states are given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the site components for cluster @xmath36 .",
    "from these cluster molecular orbital densities of states an approximate momentum variation across the brillouin zone can be constructed ( see below ) .",
    "for instance , in the case of the square lattice with @xmath38 , densities associated with the high - symmetry points of the original lattice are given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the density of states corresponds to the local density @xmath65 .",
    "note , however , that all molecular orbital densities extend across the entire band width .",
    "thus , they are not identical with those sections of the local density of states that originate in momentum regions surrounding the high - symmetry points , as would be the case in the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca).@xcite    we now project the green s function @xmath51 defined in eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) onto a cluster consisting of @xmath36 impurity levels and @xmath66 bath levels .",
    "the total number of levels is @xmath67 . in the site basis",
    "we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the non - interacting impurity cluster hamiltonian and @xmath70 the hybridization matrix describing the coupling between impurity cluster and bath .",
    "thus , @xmath71 for the square lattice we choose @xmath72 and for the triangular lattice @xmath73 , so that the fermi level coincides with @xmath74 .    instead of expressing the non - diagonal hybridization matrix @xmath70 in a site basis , it is convenient to go over to the molecular orbital basis in which @xmath51 is diagonal . assuming that each component @xmath54 couples only with its own bath , we have @xmath75 where @xmath76 represents an impurity level , @xmath77 the bath levels , and @xmath78 the hybridization matrix elements .",
    "the incorporation of the impurity level @xmath76 ensures a much better fit of @xmath54 than by projecting only onto bath orbitals .",
    "for instance , for @xmath39 and @xmath79 ( i.e. , three bath levels per impurity orbital ) , each component @xmath54 is fitted using seven parameters : one impurity level @xmath76 , three bath levels @xmath77 and three hopping integrals @xmath78 . since according to eq .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) there are two independent functions , we use a total of 14 fit parameters to represent these two @xmath80 components .",
    "this procedure allows for a considerably more flexible projection of the green s function matrix @xmath51 onto the bath . in a site basis for",
    "an isotropic triangular lattice ( taking again three bath levels per site ) one would have instead only 6 fit parameters if each site couples to its own bath .",
    "effectively , therefore , the molecular orbital basis accounts for several additional cross hybridization terms as well as internal cluster couplings ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , it is much more reliable to fit the two independent molecular orbital components @xmath54 than a non - diagonal site matrix @xmath81 with an equivalent number of parameters .",
    "analogous considerations hold for the two - site and four - site clusters of the square lattice .",
    "for example , for @xmath38 , @xmath79 there are two independent functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is related to @xmath82 ) , giving a total of 10 fit parameters , compared to only two parameters in a simple site picture with fourforld and particle hole symmetry .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the typical quality of the projection of the lattice components of @xmath54 onto the bath for @xmath39 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , although only two bath levels per orbital are included ( i.e. , using five parameters per orbital ) , the fit of both real and imaginary parts is excellent . for these cluster sizes and low temperatures ,",
    "iterations take only a few minutes .",
    "fits of similar quality are achieved for multi - orbital materials.@xcite to achieve even better agreement at low frequencies , it is preferable to minimize not the bare difference @xmath86 but to divide these functions first by @xmath87 .",
    "we now discuss the evaluation of the finite temperature interacting cluster green s function .",
    "if this step is carried out in the diagonal molecular orbital basis , the coulomb interaction must be expressed as a matrix containing many inter - orbital components . for",
    "@xmath38 it can be easily shown that @xmath88 for 64 of the possible 256 configurations .",
    "all other matrix elements vanish .",
    "this step can be circumvented by working in a mixed basis consisting of cluster sites @xmath89 and bath orbitals @xmath90 .",
    "we illustrate this procedure here for the triangular lattice with @xmath39 .",

    "( [ g ] ) is not diagonal .",
    "thus , the orbital component of the lattice green s function @xmath52 is influenced not only by the corresponding self - energy @xmath53 , but by the other orbital elements as well .",

    "( [ grho ] ) , suggesting that the gap at @xmath156 does not open at the same @xmath0 as at @xmath153 . instead ,",
    "as argued above , the metal insulator transition at @xmath156 is caused by the same self - energy terms as at @xmath153 , i.e. , the mott gap opens uniformly .",
    "as pointed out earlier , in the molecular orbital basis the coulomb matrix has a large number of non - zero elements .",
    "thus , in this basis there is not only single - particle hybridization arising from @xmath28 , but also strong inter - orbital coulomb repulsion .",
    "nevertheless , the above analysis reveals that , although these coulomb interaction terms are properly taken into account , the spectral distributions at @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 do not exhibit a mott gap unless the non - diagonal terms of @xmath28 in the orbital basis are included .",
    "it is therefore the single - particle part of the hamiltonian that provides the correct connection between the self - energy components and thereby generates the true momentum variation of the spectral distribution of the single band .",
    "because of the strong coupling between orbitals , the notion that some of these orbitals undergo a mott transition while others do not , does not appear appropriate .",
    "as shown consistently by all orbital - resolved spectra in the present multi - site ed / dmft study , there is a single mott transition common to all cluster molecular orbitals , implying a simultaneous opening of the mott gap across the entire fermi - surface .",
    "nevertheless , in agreement with previous authors , we find pronounced momentum variation of quasi - particle properties close to the mott transition .    in view of the approximate nature of the momentum variation of the lattice self - energy and green s function derived within the cdmft it would be very interesting to compare the above results with analogous ones obtained within the dca,@xcite in particular , since the cluster molecular orbital components of the density of states , as stated above , differ appreciably between these two cluster dmft schemes.@xcite this comparison will be addressed in a future publication .",
    "the scenario discussed in this section differs strikingly from the one found for several multi - orbital materials which have been studied previously by various groups . for the sake of comparison we review some of these systems in the following section",
    "during the recent years single - site multi - orbital dmft has been used extensively to investigate the metal insulator transition of a variety of materials.@xcite here , we briefly discuss some of these systems which are regarded as typical mott insulators , and which all exhibit characteristic changes of the electronic structure as the metallic phase is replaced by the insulator at large coulomb energies .    figure  9 shows the correlation driven enhancement of orbital polarization for latio@xmath1 , v@xmath4o@xmath1 and ca@xmath4ruo@xmath5 . because of the orthorhombic structure of latio@xmath1 ,",
    "lda calculations reveal that the @xmath3 subbands of the @xmath8 sector are slightly more occupied than the two @xmath2 components.@xcite local coulomb interactions enhance this @xmath8 crystal field splitting , so that at the mott transition close to @xmath137  ev the @xmath2 bands become nearly empty and the @xmath3 band half - filled.@xcite in the case of v@xmath4o@xmath1 , the corundum lattice structure ensures that the doubly degenerate @xmath2 bands have slightly larger binding energy than the @xmath3 bands.@xcite with increasing coulomb interaction this crystal field splitting is strongly enhanced , until in the range @xmath174  ev , the @xmath3 bands are pushed above the fermi level and the @xmath2 bands become half - filled.@xcite finally , in the case of ca@xmath175sr@xmath176ruo@xmath5 , sr substitution via the smaller ca ions gives rise to an enlarged crystal field splitting between @xmath6 and @xmath7 like subbands.@xcite coulomb correlations increase this splitting , until in the mott phase the @xmath6 bands are fully occupied and the half - filled @xmath7 bands are split into lower and upper hubbard bands.@xcite    -17 mm    schematically , the uncorrelated densities of states of these transition metal oxides and the spectra derived within single - site multi - orbital dmft for realistic coulomb energies are shown in figure  10 .",
    "note that in the metallic phase , both orbital symmetries contribute to the spectral weight at the fermi level . in the mott phase ,",
    "the gap involes transitions between states of opposite symmetry character .    despite the different subband occupancies of these materials , they exhibit a similar correlation driven enhancement of orbital polarization.@xcite by pushing some subbands above or below the fermi level ,",
    "the effective degeneracy is reduced from three to two or one .",
    "the mott transition therefore occurs at lower critical coulomb energy than in a cubic environment with equivalent subbands .    according to figure  1",
    ", the cluster molecular orbital densities of the single band hubbard model in a multi - site picture also exhibit a substantial splitting relative to the total band width .",
    "nevertheless , coulomb correlations in these cases only lead to moderate charge transfer between these cluster orbitals , as demonstrated by the results given in fig .  2 .",
    "the main physical reason for this qualitative difference with respect to the multi - orbital materials is the strong single - particle hybridization among orbitals so that any tendency towards orbital selective mott transitions is suppressed .",
    "for the same reason , partial band filling or emptying , with a mott transition in the remaining subset of bands , as found in several multi - orbital materials , is also absent .    a certain amount of inter - orbital hybridization exists also in multi - orbital systems since the single - electron hamiltonian in the orbital basis is not diagonal throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "this residual coupling , however , is much weaker than in the single - band multi - site system , so that coulomb correlations can indeed lead to nearly complete orbital polarization .",
    "this is supported by the dmft results for latio@xmath1 and v@xmath4o@xmath1 which have been studied both by evaluating the lattice green s function via eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) ( see refs.@xcite ) and via the approximate version , eq .",
    "( [ grho ] ) ( see refs.@xcite ) . in these systems",
    "both formulations give very similar results , in particular , both confirm the scenario of strong orbital polarization .",
    "cellular dmft combined with finite temperature exact diagonalization has been used to investigate the influence of short range correlations on the mott transition in the single - band hubbard model .",
    "both square and triangular lattices at half - filling were studied .",
    "a mixed basis consisting of cluster sites and bath molecular orbitals was shown to provide an efficient method for the evaluation of the cluster self - energies and green s functions . since in the cluster molecular orbital representation these quantities become diagonal",
    ", an intriguing analogy exists between coulomb correlations in these multi - site single - band systems and several multi - orbital materials which were studied previously within single - site dmft .",
    "in remarkable contrast to latio@xmath1 , v@xmath4o@xmath1 , and ca@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , which exhibit pronounced orbital polarization at the mott transition , the single - band systems show very little correlation driven enhancement of orbital polarization .",
    "thus , all cluster molecular orbitals take part in the metal insulator transition .",
    "moreover , the transition occurs at the same critical @xmath0 for all cluster orbitals . since an approximate momentum variation of the",
    "lattice self - energy and green s function can be constructed from a superposition of these molecular orbital components , this finding yields the important result that the mott gap opens simultaneously across the entire fermi surface .",
    "thus , for both square and triangular lattices at half filling , there is no orbital selective mott transition , where certain sections of the brillouin zone would open a gap at lower coulomb energy than other parts .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence for the combination of subband - filling and mott transition in other subbands , that is characteristic of the multi - orbital materials mentioned above .",
    "it would be of great interest to investigate whether these findings also hold at a finer momentum resolution which would require cluster sizes larger than @xmath38 .",
