    "black holes oscillate . the associated quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of oscillation are relevant for many reasons .",
    "most importantly , numerical relativity has provided ample evidence that the qnms dominate the gravitational - wave signal associated with many processes involving dynamical black holes ( such as the formation of black holes in gravitational collapse or binary merger ) .",
    "since the qnms encode information concerning the parameters of the black hole one may hope that the gravitational - wave detectors that are now coming into operation will be able to use these signals to investigate the black hole population of the universe .    even though most studies of qnms have been motivated by their potential astrophysical relevance ,",
    "there are several other reasons why one might be interested in understanding the spectrum of oscillations of a black hole .",
    "in particular , the modes have played a key role in discussions of black hole stability @xcite . a closely related issue concerns mode - completeness .",
    "it now seems clear that the qnms do not form a complete set ( at least not in the conventional sense ) because of the presence of power - law tails caused by the backscattering of waves ( see @xcite for a discussion and references ) .",
    "the problem also has interesting computational aspects . while the slowly damped qnms , for which @xmath0 this was contradicted by results obtained by guinn et al using a wkb formula @xcite .",
    "their calculation suggested that the real part of the qnm frequencies would vanish asymptotically .",
    "the controversy was resolved by two calculations which agreed that the correct asymptotic result was @xmath1 the first calculation was based on a slight reformulation of the continued fraction algorithm @xcite , while the second used a high order phase - integral formula @xcite .",
    "the latter calculation also shed light on the reasons for the breakdown of the method used by guinn et al .",
    "this issue is further discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the laws of black - hole thermodynamics are by now well established , many issues remain unclear .",
    "it is , for example , not clear to what extent the black hole entropy @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the area of the event horizon , can be understood in terms of the statistics of a given set of microstates .",
    "( we use units such that @xmath4 throughout the paper . ) bekenstein and colleagues have discussed this problem in terms of a quantised area ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "then , in analogy with a typical finite system , a black hole would have a discrete spectrum .",
    "one can argue that @xcite @xmath5 comparing this with @xmath6 where we have associated the `` energy spacing '' with a frequency through @xmath7 ( roughly speaking , @xmath8 corresponds to a `` transition energy '' ) , one finds that the spacing between consecutive states ( for macroscopic black holes , with @xmath9 ) will correspond to a frequency @xmath10 the standard argument , which favours @xmath11 , would make the entropy spacing between energy levels exactly one `` bit '' , which is attractive from the information theory point of view .",
    "a key result is that , in this picture any radiation will be emitted in multiples of the fundamental frequency @xmath8 .",
    "hence , essentially no radiation should be radiated with frequencies below @xmath8 .",
    "if true , this is a highly significant conclusion since it suggests that the quantum nature of black holes might be observable at the macroscopic level .",
    "as has been demonstrated by ashtekar and his collaborators @xcite , one can arrive at the same conclusions within the framework of loop quantum gravity ( see @xcite for a nice introduction ) .",
    "this approach is based on the notion of quantum geometry , which means that it is natural to ask what the quantum of area might be .",
    "again , it is possible to draw conclusions from considerations of macroscopic black holes . for large black holes",
    "it has been shown that @xcite @xmath12 the parameter @xmath13 is an unknown `` natural constant '' called the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "it plays an important role because it fixes an ambiguity in the theory .",
    "if this parameter could be determined by an independent `` experiment '' the theory would become predictive .",
    "in fact , the barbero - immirzi parameter can be fixed by carrying out a calculation of the black - hole entropy and comparing to the standard result , eq .",
    "( [ entrop ] ) . by attributing entropy to microstates ( actually nodes of spin networks ,",
    "see @xcite ) it can be shown that @xmath14 provided that the lowest permissible spin is @xmath15 .",
    "again the area quantum is @xmath16 .",
    "so what does this have to do with the black hole qnms ?",
    "the possible connection between the classical vibrations of a black - hole spacetime and various quantum aspects has been discussed for quite some time . for an early contribution to the debate ,",
    "see ref .",
    "the recent interest in a possible association between the two problems followed a very simple observation .",
    "a few years ago , hod @xcite noticed that the numerical results for asymptotic schwarzschild qnms seemed to suggest that @xmath17 if we identify the ( real part of the ) asymptotic qnm frequency with the quantum interstate spacing , we can use this value in ( [ corr ] ) to get @xmath18 this is a tantalizing result .",
    "it would fit nicely into bekenstein s thermodynamical picture provided that the `` fundamental '' frequency is associated with @xmath19 rather than 2 .",
    "furthermore , dreyer @xcite has shown that this would be the prediction of loop quantum gravity if it were based on so(3 ) rather than su(2 ) .",
    "in this case the predicted barbero - immirzi parameter would be @xmath20 there are , of course , problems associated with this change . in particular , so(3 ) is not favoured because it would seem not to allow coupling to fermions .",
    "hence , one would need to either explain why fermions should be excluded @xcite , or provide an alternative derivation of the black hole entropy ( perhaps using a different statistics for the quantised area states @xcite ) .",
    "various other relevant issues have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we now have a testable prediction .",
    "if hod s argument holds , one should be able to learn something useful from , for example , the asymptotic behaviour of the reissner - nordstrm qnm frequencies .",
    "however , until very recently only the slowly damped qnms of reissner - nordstrm black holes had been calculated @xcite .",
    "the present paper is motivated by the recent discussion @xcite .",
    "our aim is to use the complex coordinate wkb method @xcite in its very simplest form to determine asymptotic qnms for schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "as we will see , this leads to results that agree with those of motl and neitzke @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our analysis fills several gaps left by their study and extends the discussion of the final result considerably .",
    "the equations governing various classes of non - rotating black - hole perturbations can be written @xcite @xmath21 \\psi = 0\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the perturbations depend of time as @xmath22 .",
    "the tortoise coordinate is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 depends on the spacetime geometry , and is here given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath27 is its electric charge .",
    "the two solutions to @xmath28 determine the location of the event horizon @xmath29 and , for charged black holes , the inner cauchy horizon @xmath30 .",
    "the definition ( [ tortdef ] ) is such that the causally attainable spacetime region outside the black hole , @xmath31 , is mapped onto @xmath32 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath33 is of short range , which means that @xmath34 both near the horizon and at infinity . with our chosen time - dependence",
    "the solution behaving as @xmath35 represents an outgoing wave at infinity , while @xmath36 is a ingoing wave near the horizon .",
    "it is easy to explain one of the main difficulties associated with the qnm problem .",
    "suppose we want to calculate a damped qnm , i.e. a solution for which i m  @xmath37 .",
    "then the solution that represents outgoing waves at infinity will grow exponentially as @xmath38 increases .",
    "this means that we will need exponential precision in order to filter out the ingoing - wave contribution and impose the desired boundary condition .",
    "this is not a straightforward computational task .",
    "a similar difficulty arises with the boundary condition at the horizon .",
    "however , the problem becomes straightforward if we analytically continue into the complex coordinate plane .",
    "suppose , for example , that we analyse the problem along a line such that @xmath39 is purely real .",
    "then the two asymptotic solutions would be purely oscillatory and it would be easy to impose the boundary conditions . of course , before we can benefit from this idea we must understand how the solutions change under analytic continuation .",
    "fortunately , the relevant principles are well known from wkb / phase - integral theory .",
    "in fact , in this paper we will only use results that were well understood at least 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this kind of analysis is that it does not require the use of complicated comparison equations to spot special solutions whose analytic properties can be exploited ( it is an `` atomic '' description rather than a `` molecular '' one ) .    in order to analyse the black hole problem we prefer to work in the complex @xmath40-plane ( this is natural since the tortoise coordinate is multi - valued ) . introducing a new dependent variable @xmath41 we readily rewrite the perturbation equation as @xmath42 where @xmath43 ^ 2 - { 1 \\over 2}{\\delta \\over r^2 }   { d^2 \\over dr^2 } \\left ( { \\delta \\over r^2 } \\right )    \\right\\ } \\label{rdef}\\ ] ] as is well known , the two wkb solutions to an equation of form ( [ sch ] ) can be written @xmath44 \\label{wkbsol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath45 .",
    "however , under some circumstances it is useful to use a slightly different function as basis for the approximation . as we will discuss in the next section",
    ", we will exercise this freedom in our analysis of the asymptotic black hole problem . note that , without loss of generality , the lower limit of integration @xmath46 is customarily taken to be one of the zeros of @xmath47 . throughout this paper",
    "we will indicate the relevant lower limit of integration by a subscript on @xmath48 as in ( [ wkbsol ] ) .    the zeros and poles of the function @xmath47 play a central role in any complex coordinate analysis of ( [ sch ] ) . from each simple zero of @xmath49 emanates three so - called `` stokes lines '' . along each of these contours @xmath50 is purely imaginary , which means that one of the two solutions grows exponentially , while the second solution decays , as we move away from @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , one of the solutions is exponentially dominant on the stokes line , while the other solution is sub - dominant .",
    "analogously , one can define three `` anti - stokes lines '' associated with each simple zero of @xmath49 . on anti - stokes lines",
    "@xmath50 is purely real , which means that the two solutions are purely oscillatory . as we cross an anti - stokes line , the dominancy of the two functions @xmath48 changes .",
    "the three - fold symmetry associated with each zero of @xmath49 is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "stokes lines are vital for wkb analysis , because it is in the vicinity of these contours that the solution changes character .",
    "that is , if the solution is appropriately represented by a certain linear combination of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in some region of the complex @xmath40-plane , the linear combination will change as the solution is extended across a stokes line .",
    "the induced change is not complicated : the coefficient of the dominant solution remains unchanged , while the coefficient of the solution which is subdominant on the relevant stokes line picks up a contribution proportional to the coefficient of the dominant solution .",
    "this is known as the `` stokes phenomenon '' @xcite .",
    "the contant of proportionality is known as a `` stokes constant '' .",
    "this change is necessary for the particular representation ( [ wkbsol ] ) to preserve the monodromy of the global solution .",
    "terms that are exponentially small in one sector of the complex plane may be overlooked . however , in other sectors they can grow to exponentially dominate the solution . by incorporating the stokes phenomenon",
    ", we have a formally exact procedure which leads to a proper account of all exponentially small terms .    in the particular case of an isolated simple zero @xmath46 of @xmath49",
    "the problem is straightforward @xcite .",
    "suppose that the solution in the initial region of the complex plane is given by @xmath53 then , after crossing a stokes line emanating from @xmath46 ( and on which @xmath51 is dominant ) the solution becomes @xmath54 the sign depends on whether one crosses the stokes line in the positive ( anti - clockwise ) or negative ( clockwise ) direction .",
    "it is crucial to note that this simple result , i.e. that the stokes constant is @xmath55 , only holds when the stokes line emanates from the zero that is used as lower limit for the phase - integral .",
    "that is , when we want to use the above result to construct an approximate solution valid in various regions of the complex plane we must often change the reference point for the phase - integral .",
    "this leads to the need to evaluate integrals of the type @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two simple zeros of @xmath49 .    a final issue that must be mentioned before we proceed concerns branch cuts .",
    "in general we need to introduce branch cuts from the simple zeros of @xmath49 in order to ensure that the phase integrands remain single - valued .",
    "however , one can usually place these cuts in such a way that they do not affect the analysis . in the following derivations",
    "this is the case .",
    "we will choose the phase of the square - root of @xmath49 such that @xmath59 this means that the outgoing - wave solution at infinity is proportional to @xmath51 while the ingoing - wave solution at the horizon is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "in the case of schwarzschild black holes ( when @xmath60 ) there are two classes of gravitational perturbations , usually refered to as axial and polar @xcite .",
    "we will only consider the axial case here .",
    "this is , however , no restriction since it has been shown that the two cases are isospectral @xcite .",
    "that is , the qnms are the same in both cases .",
    "once we have derived the relevant wkb condition for axial gravitational perturbations we will discuss the case of electromagnetic waves in the schwarzschild background .    in the case of axial gravitational perturbations ,",

    "( [ rdef ] ) we deduce that the function @xmath62 has two second order poles and four zeros . since the zeros are closely associated with the stokes phenomenon , we need to know their location , as well as the nature of the stokes and anti - stokes lines .",
    "it is easy to show that , when i m  @xmath63 the zeros all approach the origin of the complex @xmath40-plane .",
    "this allows us to simplify the analysis considerably . expanding in a power series near @xmath64 we have @xmath65 \\approx   - { 15 \\over 4 r^2}\\ ] ] sufficiently near to the origin .",
    "note that this approximation contains no reference to @xmath66 . as @xmath67",
    "the @xmath66-dependent terms are only higher order corrections .",
    "given this behaviour it is easy to show that the exact solutions to ( [ sch ] ) should behave like @xmath68 meanwhile , if we take @xmath45 we get @xmath69 which means that @xmath70 in other words , the approximate solutions do not have the correct behaviour in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "however , by choosing @xmath71 we obtain approximate solutions with the desired behaviour near the origin .",
    "this is analogous to the `` langer modification '' @xmath72 that is used in the wkb analysis of radial quantum problems . in principle",
    ", one can also adjust the approximation near the poles at @xmath73 in the black hole problem , see for example @xcite , but since we are assuming that @xmath74 is large such alterations would not affect our final result .",

    "this will provide a clear argument in support of the known result for asymptotic schwarzchild black hole qnm frequencies .    for frequencies such that @xmath84 the pattern of stokes and anti - stokes lines for the schwarzschild problem is as sketched in figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "this means that we can readily extend the solution to the vicinity of @xmath87 .",

    "this would require a uniform approximation involving the coalescence of two zeros and two poles .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the qnms of a charged black hole is always given by ( [ rncon ] ) , and hence corresponds to the real part of the qnm frequencies approaching @xmath154 in the limit of infinite damping .",
    "but there is also likely to be an intermediate regime in which the highly damped qnms more resemble the schwarzschild result , i.e. where re  @xmath155 .",
    "as the schwarzschild limit is approached , this latter regime tends to dominate , with the true reissner - nordstrm asymptotic behaviour being relevant only for extremely rapidly damped qnms . that this is the case can be understood by the following argument : let us consider a black hole with an infinitesimal charge and qnms such that @xmath156 .",
    "the main difference between this problem and the schwarzschild case is the presence of the double pole associated with the inner horizon @xmath157 , and two additional zeroes of the function @xmath62 , defined by ( [ rdef ] ) . as the imaginary part of the qnms increases , all six zeros of @xmath62 move towards the double pole at the origin .",
    "our analysis of the problem is only relevant when the topology is that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , i.e. when the pole at @xmath157 lies outside the circle on which the six zeroes are located .",
    "for infinitesimally charged black holes there will also exist a regime where the topology of the the four zeroes already present in the schwarzschild case are essentially unchanged .",
    "for this to be true , we need to have @xmath158 at the same time the pole at @xmath157 , and the two additional zeroes that come into existence when the black hole attains charge ( and which emerge from the origin together with @xmath157 ) , must lie well inside the circle of `` schwarzschild '' zeroes .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath159 if these conditions are met one would expect the qnms to be similar to the schwarzschild ones .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] is a schematic illustration of the two regimes for highly damped reissner - nordstrm qnms . even though it is easy to explain the behaviour in principle , it is not straightforward to extend our analysis into a consistent scheme for calculating the qnms in the intermediate regime .",
    "the main reason for this is the need to evaluate the phase - integral @xmath160 . in the intermediate regime",
    "we can no longer make use of the power series expansion around the origin that led to ( [ q2s ] ) .",
    "such an expansion is only valid up to the nearest pole , i.e. @xmath157 .",
    "resolving this issue , and determining the qnms also in this intermediate regime , may be an interesting problem but we do not consider it further here .      in order to discuss the solutions to the reissner - nordstrm qnm condition , it is useful to rewrite ( [ rncon ] ) as @xmath161 where we have used ( [ ge ] ) and ( [ gi ] ) . from this",
    "we easily see that in the extremely charged case , as @xmath162 , we regain the schwarzschild result @xcite .",

    "this means that the topology is no longer that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and hence the extreme reissner - nordstrm case would require a separate analysis .    in order to analyse the general case , we introduce @xmath165 the condition can then be written as @xmath166 in general , this condition must be solved numerically .",
    "one way to do this is to first separate the real and imaginary parts of the equation .",
    "letting @xmath167 we obtain the two equations @xmath168 these equations are very useful .",
    "first of all we see that , if we want the solution to be periodic in @xmath169 , we must require simultaneously @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are integers .",
    "that is , periodicity in i m  @xmath8 is only possible if @xmath173 since @xmath174 we see that we will pass through all ( positive ) rational values for @xmath175 as the charge of the black hole is varied . hence , there will be an infinite set of cases where the solution is periodic in the imaginary part .",
    "however , whenever @xmath175 is not a rational number , the spectrum ceases to be periodic in the imaginary part .",
    "this is a significant observation because it illustrates that the asymptotic reissner - nordstrm spectrum is generally very different from that of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "one might wonder if the inclusion of higher order terms in the approximation would reimpose periodicity in i m  @xmath8 for irrational values of @xmath175 .",
    "however , this seems unlikely since it would require a surprising `` conspiracy '' between these terms .",
    "the difficulty ( due to truncation error ) of representing exactly rational numbers would pose significant challenges for a numerical verification of this result .    for @xmath172 and @xmath171 integers we can introduce @xmath176 to get @xmath177 which obviously has @xmath178 roots ( one of these polynomial cases was discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "these roots lead to @xmath179 only some of these roots will be compatible with the derivation of our wkb condition since we assumed that re  @xmath180 at the outset .",

    "one of these roots ( for @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) is present in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "in particular , it is not clear to what extent these solutions are relevant for a discussion of `` purely outgoing wave '' solutions .",
    "furthermore , one has to be careful because only some of the purely imaginary roots belong to modes that can be traced back to a schwarzschild qnm .",
    "the condition ( [ rncon ] ) was derived assuming that the real part of the frequency was positive . yet",

    "the numerical solutions illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] clearly show the spiral nature of the qnms .",
    "furthermore , we see that the number of times that each spiral touches the imaginary axis increases with the `` order '' of the mode . it is clear",
    "that , as i m  @xmath190 the spirals tighten , i.e. the qnm frequency becomes exponentially sensitive to variations in @xmath27 . whether this is a hint that the problem becomes probabilistic in the limit of infinite damping is not clear .",

    "perhaps the most relevant result concerns the fact that the asymptotic qnm frequencies of charged black holes are in general not periodic in the imaginary part .",

    "unfortunately , the available results do not provide a clear answer to this question .",

    "for example , what about the fact that the real part of the electromagnetic qnms vanishes asymptotically ?",
    "although interesting in its own right , this result is probably not relevant for the discussion .",
    "a natural reason for this would be the fundamental difference between gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations of schwarzschild black holes . while electromagnetic perturbations correspond to waves propagating in a fixed background , the gravitational waves represent oscillations of the spacetime itself",
    ". it would perhaps not be surprising if results for the former problem tell us little about the quantum levels of the black hole .",
    "could a study of massive fields allow us to make progress ?",
    "the situation is even more complicated when we turn to the reissner - nordstrm problem . how can our results be understood ? at first sight it would be tempting to suggest that the generally nonperiodic nature of the asymptotic qnm spectrum , with no unique re  @xmath196 , provides an argument against any quantum correspondence .",
    "however , this conclusion might be premature .",
    "one reason for this is that a general perturbation of a reissner - nordstrm black hole corresponds to a mixture of electromagnetic and gravitational waves",
    ". would it be too surprising if this mixing were to prevent a simple correspondence argument ?",
    "moreover , we have the unexpected result that we retain the same result for the asymptotic qnms in both the schwarzschild and the extreme reissner - nordstrm limits .",
