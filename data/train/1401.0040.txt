    "the proof is similar for @xmath43 .    in @xcite ,",
    "a general theory of voronoi polytopes for euclidean metrics is developed . as a consequence of this theory ,",
    "one obtains that as one modifies the euclidean metric , the voronoi polytope evolves smoothly .",
    "this property is generalized in @xcite where a general stability result is proved for _ uniformly convex spaces _ ( also called _ rotund _ or _ strictly convex _ ) , i.e. ones for which the equality @xmath49 and @xmath50 imply @xmath51 .",
    "no space , whose norm is defined by a polyhedral metric , is uniformly convex .",
    "no such stability exists , in general , for polyhedral metrics , but one has the following result :    let @xmath52 be a sequence of polyhedral metrics that converges towards a polyhedral metric @xmath15 .",
    "then one has the following inclusions on the voronoi polytopes : @xmath53    if @xmath54 , then one has @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the voronoi polytope is bounded ; so , only a finite set of those inequalities is relevant . for any fixed vector @xmath57 , it holds @xmath58 . as a consequence , for @xmath59 large enough the inclusion holds . a similar proof works for the other inclusion .",
    "the above shows that we need to consider both @xmath42 and @xmath60 in our work , especially in degenerate situations as defined below :    we say that a norm @xmath0 for @xmath34 is _ non - degenerate _ if @xmath61 is the closure of @xmath62 .",
    "but it is hard to work with the voronoi polytope directly , and we need instead an object that is more amenable to polyhedral methods .    for a point @xmath63 , we define the _ distance to nearest neighbor _ as @xmath64 the _ covering radius _ is defined as @xmath65 in the case of the euclidean norm @xmath0 , for any two distinct points @xmath66 , the set of _ equidistant points _",

    "this phenomenon also occurs when the considered points belong to a lattice ( see figure [ lattice_deg_nondeg ] ) .    a degenerate configuration    a non - degenerate configuration    we now define the main notion of _ @xmath5-space _",

    "since the @xmath5-spaces are polytopal , they also can be described by their vertices . on the other hand , because of a degree of arbitrariness in the choice of the @xmath5-spaces , we need a notion of vertices that is independent of the chosen partition into @xmath5-spaces .
