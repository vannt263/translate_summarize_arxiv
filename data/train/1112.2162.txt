    "the interaction of molecular species with surfaces is of critical importance in astrophysical environments .",
    "much interstellar chemistry occurs on or in the icy layers which cover dust grains in molecular clouds , the birthplace of stars and planets @xcite .",
    "these dust grains are believed to be composed of silicates and carbonaceous material @xcite .",
    "the silicate is at least @xmath1  95  % amorphous , as determined from the breadth of the 9.7  @xmath2 m band @xcite , and although its composition has not been determined precisely , is well approximated by amorphous olivine ( mgfesio@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the silicates are believed to be fluffy in nature , with a large surface area upon which reactions can occur @xcite .    at the low temperatures in molecular clouds ( t  @xmath4  20  k ) atoms and molecules freeze out onto these silicate surfaces , forming the icy mantles .",
    "amorphous solid water ( asw ) is by far the largest component of this ice , with abundances of @xmath1  1  @xmath5  10@xmath6 with respect to the total h column density @xcite , equivalent to coverages of up to 100 monolayers ( ml ) .",
    "given that the extinction threshold for h@xmath0o mantles is a@xmath7  @xmath1  3.3 mag @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that between the dense pre - stellar cores ( where dust grains are completely coated by this icy mantle ) and the cloud edges ( where competition between ice formation and photodesorption of h@xmath0o yields a population of bare silicate grains @xcite ) , there must be a region where icy surfaces and bare silicates co - exist .",
    "as interstellar regions evolve , the icy grains are further processed , either by gentle heating or cyclic desorption - deposition events @xcite , producing crystalline h@xmath0o .",
    "this has been detected in various stellar and pre - planetary environments , including , for example , m giant stars @xcite , quaoar in the kuiper belt @xcite , trans neptune objects @xcite , comets @xcite , and in the outer disks around t tauri stars @xcite .    as gas - grain modelling of interstellar environments becomes more sophisticated @xcite ,",
    "key questions impeding the full implementation of surface chemistry include : what effect does the underlying grain surface have on the desorption characteristics of key molecules , and to what extent is this desorption affected as we move from the multilayer to sub - monolayer coverage regime ?",
    "a third issue is how to realise the transition between the multilayer and monolayer regimes in a gas - grain model without overloading the model with many more layers of complexity .",
    "co , o@xmath0 and co@xmath0 are all interstellar molecules that potentially could populate bare interstellar grains at sub - monolayer coverages . on ice , only one previous study focussed on sub - monolayer coverages of co , highlighting the spectroscopic rather than desorption characteristics of the porous asw : co system @xcite .",
    "to date , no desorption studies of co , o@xmath0 or co@xmath0 have been made on a silicate surface , at either multilayer or sub - monolayer coverages .",
    "co is the second most abundant interstellar molecule @xcite , and is known to form in the gas phase , then freeze - out on to h@xmath0o covered grains to form overlayers of pure co ice , the layer thickness critically depending on gas density rather than grain temperature @xcite .",
    "consequently , extensive temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) studies have been made of multilayer co coverages on various surfaces , including au @xcite , h@xmath0o @xcite , a meteorite sample @xcite and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that both co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o form on dust grains in molecular clouds , and recent studies suggest that at least some of the co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o is formed concurrently @xcite .",
    "since co is the key precursor to co@xmath0 formation , such mechanisms would require co freeze - out onto bare grain surfaces long before co ice , or even large quantities of h@xmath0o ice , are detected .",
    "although tenuous , spectroscopic observational and experimental evidence exists for such a freeze - out process @xcite , but an investigation of the desorption behaviour of co at sub - monolayer coverages on ice and silicate surfaces is vital if we want to be certain that it can reside at an interstellar grain surface long enough to form more complex species .    similarly , o@xmath0 is a potential precursor in h@xmath0o formation @xcite , and is also a species likely to form in the gas phase then freeze - out onto grain surfaces , rather than forming on the grain itself .",
    "however , as a homonuclear diatomic o@xmath0 is infrared inactive , so its detection in interstellar ice , though occasionally claimed via a forbidden transition @xcite remains elusive .",
    "it is not clear whether this is related to the weak transition probability , lack of a significant o@xmath0 population in the ice , or that the o@xmath0 has rapidly reacted ( upon adsorption ) to exclusively form h@xmath0o .",
    "nevertheless , the multilayer desorption behaviour of o@xmath0 has been studied previously alongside co and n@xmath0 @xcite , as well as on au , porous asw @xcite and tio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the multilayer desorption characteristics of o@xmath0 are very similar to co , so it is interesting from both a chemical and astrophysical viewpoint to also investigate the desorption behaviour of o@xmath0 at sub - monolayer coverages on ice and silicate surfaces .",
    "the desorption characteristics of co@xmath0 have not been extensively studied on any surface , despite it being one of the most abundant solid phase molecular species in the interstellar medium .",
    "recently the desorption characteristics of multilayer co@xmath0 were reported from porous asw , and have been previously studied on hopg @xcite , porous asw and au @xcite .",
    "however , given that the observational @xcite and experimental @xcite evidence shows that a fraction of co@xmath0 ice must form concurrently with the water ice layer , some co@xmath0 molecules must populate both the bare silicate grains and the ice layers at sub - monolayer coverages .    here",
    "we present an experimental study of the desorption of co , o@xmath0 and co@xmath0 from three different surfaces ; non - porous asw , crystalline ice , and amorphous olivine - type silicate . as these are , for the first time , all undertaken in the same experimental set - up ",
    "formolism @xcite  we are able to investigate both the individual effect of each surface on the desorption characteristics , as well as determining whether the molecular composition or morphology of the surface is most relevant in determining the desorption behaviour of molecules . for each of the nine combinations of co , o@xmath0 and co@xmath0 on each surface ,",
    "our study has encompassed both the multilayer and sub - monolayer regimes .",
    "these data are modelled to determine a simple analytical expression which accurately calculates both the sub - monolayer and the multilayer desorption energies . by changing the model to incorporate interstellar , rather than experimental , heating rates ,",
    "we are able to address the key questions above , namely : what effect does the underlying surface have on the desorption characteristics of the molecules adsorbed there , and how is this desorption modified in the sub - monolayer coverage regime ?",
    "the experiments were conducted using the formolism set - up ( formation of molecules in the interstellar medium ) , described in detail elsewhere @xcite . briefly , the set - up consists of an ultra - high vacuum chamber ( base pressure @xmath1  10@xmath8 mbar ) , containing a silicate - coated copper sample surface , operating at temperatures between 18 and 400  k. the system is equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) , which is used for the tpd experiments . a sample of either o@xmath0 , co or co@xmath0 was deposited onto the surface at 18  k via the triply differentially pumped beam line ; a linear temperature ramp was then applied to the surface , and the qms used to measure the desorption of each species into the gas phase , as a function of temperature .",

    "< , < \" , ]     @xmath9 full wetting behaviour is seen for molecules which fill all the lowest energy sites on the surface before forming a multilayer . intermediate",
    "behaviour is when the molecules start to fill the surface , but form islands before it is full .",
    "non - wetting behaviour is when islands are almost immediately formed by molecules on the surface .",
    "( dot - dashed ) and co@xmath0 ( dashed ) from h@xmath0o@xmath10 ( black ) , h@xmath0o@xmath11 ( dark grey ) and sio@xmath12 ( light grey ) at a heating rate of 1  kcentury@xmath13 . for comparison ,",
    "the black dotted line shows the modelled desorption characteristics of co on h@xmath0o@xmath10 if only multilayer desorption is included in the model.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    under astrophysical conditions , the heating rate is likely to be on the order of 1  kcentury@xmath13 ( hot core heating rate @xcite ) , many orders of magnitude slower than the laboratory value of 10  kmin@xmath13 employed here . by simulating the desorption profiles of the molecule - surface combinations here ,",
    "it is possible to investigate whether surface type and coverage is likely to affect desorption characteristics on astrophysically relevant timescales .    figure  [ fgr : astro ] presents the results of such a simulation for all molecule - surface combinations , assuming a 2  ml coverage of each species on each grain ( i.e. one multilayer and one monolayer ) .",
    "this seems reasonable as none of these species ( except possibly co ) form large pure ice overlayers in the ism . in figure",
    "[ fgr : astro ] , the dot - dashed line shows the modelled desorption characteristics of 2  ml of co from h@xmath0o@xmath10 if only multilayer desorption is considered .",
    "it is evident that without including the sub - monolayer component of the model , the desorption time is vastly underestimated ( by over a few @xmath5 10@xmath14  years or 10  15  k ) , particularly for co and co@xmath0 .",
    "this is a comparable error to that introduced when gas - grain models treat multilayer desorption as first order , as suggested previously @xcite , and illustrates that sub - monolayer desorption characteristics are fundamental to describing the overall desorption profile of species on astrophysical timescales .",
    "figure  [ fgr : astro ] shows that for o@xmath0 there is the least difference between the time ( or temperature ) at which desorption would be completed in the multilayer only model versus the combined multilayer - monolayer model .",
    "however , monolayers of both co and co@xmath0 are able to reside directly at the surface for thousands of years , or at equivalent temperatures 10  15  k higher , than those predicted by multilayer desorption alone , particularly on the amorphous silicate surface . in quiescent regions of the interstellar medium or at the edges of molecular clouds , where grains are warmer , this would suggest that small molecules , like co and co@xmath0 , could easily be present on the grain surfaces , potentially undergoing chemistry to generate larger chemical species , long before detectable ice layers really form .",
    "such processes have been postulated previously @xcite , and it remains an interesting follow - on from this work to see which chemical species will form in astrochemical models when these sub - monolayer desorption data are considered .",
    "what is also clear from figure  [ fgr : astro ] is that , while the molecules desorb at different times ( and temperatures ) , there is a clear pattern to the order of desorption from the various substrates .",
    "the onset of desorption from the amorphous surfaces , h@xmath0o@xmath10 and sio@xmath12 , occurs almost concurrently for all species , while desorption from h@xmath0o@xmath11 occurs later , at a higher temperature .",
    "this delay in desorption from crystalline surfaces indicates that in regions where crystalline water is predicted to dominate , for example on processed ices inside disks around ysos @xcite , or even cometary surfaces @xcite , volatile species will not start desorbing from grain surfaces for a few thousand years longer ( or over temperature ranges of a few kelvin higher ) than anticipated from zeroth order desorption kinetics models .",
    "such differences are subtle , but when one considers that these molecules will be highly mobile at such temperatures , the potential for complex chemistry to occur on the grain surfaces is increased .",
    "furthermore , it is exactly these inner disk regions , where crystalline water ice is predicted to be found , from which hot core and hot corino gases are populated by desorbing molecules(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the simulation results in figure  [ fgr : astro ] show the residence time of molecules on a h@xmath0o@xmath11 surface is significantly higher than on the amorphous surfaces . starting from a 2  ml coverage ,",
    "the time taken for 50  % of the o@xmath0 on sio@xmath12 or h@xmath0o@xmath10 to desorb is 8000  years , while on h@xmath0o@xmath11 this value is 8700  years , an increase of 8.75  % .",
    "similarly , the difference between desorption of 50  % of the molecules from h@xmath0o@xmath10 and from h@xmath0o@xmath11 is 8.82  % for co and 6.97  % for co@xmath0 .",
    "a key aim of this work was to address what effect the underlying dust grain surface could have on the desorption characteristics of molecules adsorbed there , and how this desorption is modified in the sub - monolayer coverage regime compared to the multilayer regime .",
    "this work used temperature programmed desorption to measure the desorption characteristics of o@xmath0 , co and co@xmath0 from h@xmath0o@xmath10 , h@xmath0o@xmath11 and sio@xmath12 over sub - monolayer to multilayer coverages .",
    "the experimental data were modelled using the polanyi - wigner equation , combining different approaches to reproduce the sub - monolayer and multilayer tpd traces , in particular by varying e@xmath15 as a function of coverage in the sub - monolayer regime .",
    "the desorption can be categorised as full wetting , intermediate or non - wetting behaviour , and the switching point is well described by n@xmath16 , an empirical measure of the coverage at which pure monolayer desorption stops . on both a laboratory and an astrophysically relevant timescale , the desorption characteristics of molecules from the amorphous substrates h@xmath0o@xmath10 and sio@xmath12",
    "were found to be very similar , while on the crystalline surface h@xmath0o@xmath11 , molecules desorbed at higher temperatures and on a longer timescale .",
    "it would be relatively trivial to implement the data presented here into astrochemical models ; it would require only a subroutine to describe the sub - monolayer , coverage dependent , e@xmath15 , which can be calculated using the parameters presented in this paper , and the coverage n@xmath16 , at which the true monolayer desorption ends and beyond which a fixed e@xmath15 , and zeroth order desorption can be implemented .",
    "previously , @xcite concluded that surface type is relatively unimportant , and rather it is the heating rate and grain size that dominate desorption kinetics ; we do not disagree that both these factors are important , but by not considering the sub - monolayer case , this previous work overlooks certain intricacies .",
    "firstly , the results presented here suggest that the surface type is the dominant factor controlling desorption under sub - monolayer coverage conditions .",
    "this definition of surface type must include both the surface material and the degree of crystallinity , and not simply the material alone .",
    "from the data presented here , it is clear that the desorption characteristics of molecular species from h@xmath0o@xmath10 and sio@xmath12 , two amorphous surfaces , are much more similar than those from h@xmath0o@xmath10 and h@xmath0o@xmath11 , which are composed of the same underlying material .",
    "secondly , while the size of the grain is critical to desorption characteristics , it is both the surface area and the surface - adsorbate interaction which must be considered . without including information on whether the surface - adsorbate interaction is wetting or non - wetting , it is not possible to know the coverage at which behaviour switches from sub - monolayer ( to intermediate ) to the multilayer regime , i.e. the value of n@xmath16 . as it is notoriously difficult to calculate physisorption surface - adsorbate energies theoretically , this is necessarily an empirically determined value , highlighting the importance of experiments such as those presented here .",
