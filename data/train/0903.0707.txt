    "the interest in low - dimensional electronic structures has increased steadily during the past few decades .",
    "this is mostly due to breakthroughs in semiconductor technology in the 1970s and early 1980s . at present ,",
    "low - dimensional systems form a significant portion of the whole field of condensed matter physics .",
    "some examples are layered semiconductor devices such as metal - oxide - semiconductor field effect transistors , quantum hall systems , spintronic devices , and quantum wells , wires , and dots  @xcite ( qds ) .",
    "following the advances in constructing techniques for single two - dimensional ( 2d ) qds with tunable atom - like properties , it has become possible to _ couple _ qds to form artificial `` molecules '' .",
    "coupled qds have significant potential for solid - state quantum computation through , e.g. , coherent manipulation of spins .",
    "@xcite furthermore , extended lattices or arrays of qds have been fabricated ,  @xcite which , in addition to the proposed applications in quantum information ,  @xcite show interesting magnetic phase transitions  @xcite which may be exploited in quantum transport and spintronics .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", dealing with systems of arbitrary periodic dimensionality may be complicated . in the simplest case of a fully periodic lattice of elements ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied at every cell border , and bloch s theorem describes the discrete - translation invariant form of the orbitals . on the other hand , in all the cases",
    "in which the system has reduced periodicity , the use of a supercell with periodic boundary conditions in all the directions becomes problematic .",
    "in fact , the response function of a periodic lattice is generally very different from the response of a system with reduced periodicity ( such as an isolated system , a chain , a slab , etc . ) and the convergence of the fully periodic quantity to the reduced - periodic ones as a function of the supercell size is very slow . a large supercell is a numerical disadvantage , but it is specially necessary to avoid the influence of the periodic images if long range operators are used .",
    "the main issue here is indeed the computation of a long - range operator , i.e. , the hartree ( or `` coulomb '' ) potential : @xmath0(\\mathbf{r } ) = \\int\\ ! { \\rm d}^3 r ' \\frac{n(\\mathbf{r}')}{\\vert \\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\vert}\\,,\\ ] ] which is ubiquitous in science , and which we study here in the context of 2d electronic structure calculations . in particular",
    ", we will exemplify our approach by utilizing density - functional theory ( dft ) , although the method we propose can also be useful in different fields . in fourier space",
    ", the convolution integral ( [ hertreeint ] ) is transformed into a trivial product .",
    "this fact adds to the other undoubted advantages of the supercell approach , such as the natural inclusion of the periodic boundary conditions , and the existence of very efficient fast fourier transform algorithms .    the attempt to retain these advantages ,",
    "i.e. , to compute the hartree integral in reciprocal space , has led to the creation of several cutoff schemes for finite systems , whose main intent is to provide an effective truncated coulomb interaction such that the system becomes unaware of the existence of its periodic replicas.@xcite more recently , an exact scheme was proposed to achieve a broader goal,@xcite namely to truncate the coulomb interaction in a 3d system in the dimensions along which the system is confined , leaving it long - ranged in the dimensions in which the system is periodic .    in this paper",
    "we show that a similar scheme can be drawn in a 2d space , allowing us to correct the spurious supercell effect when treating finite systems and one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains .",
    "in particular we focus on the case of a single infinite chain of 2d few - electron qds , that , in a classical supercell approach , would mistakenly appear as periodic in both directions , while it should be treated as a truly periodic system only along the x direction .",
    "we study the magnetic ground state of this system , and show that the use of the cutoff allows to speedup the calculations of ground state fundamental quantities such as the fermi level .",
    "the technique is exact if the computation parameters are chosen judiciously .",
    "the possibility of isolating the chain from the replicas permits to get an insight about the role of inter - chain interaction in determining the conductive of insulating character of the chain .",
    "we follow closely the procedure described in ref .  [ ] . the hartree integral is the convolution of the charge density @xmath1 with the coulomb interaction potential @xmath2 . in 2d , @xmath3 we consider the charge density to be in a unit cell .",
    "this unit cell may then be replicated in both directions to fill all 2d space ( the two dimensional periodic case , or `` 2d/2d '' ) , replicated in only one direction ( `` 2d/1d '' ) , or not replicated at all ( finite case , or `` 2d/0d '' ) . if we move to reciprocal space , the unit cell is always replicated periodically in both directions , which is undesired in both the 2d/1d and 2d/0d cases .",
    "the hartree integral in reciprocal space reduces to the simple multiplication : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the reciprocal vectors .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath6 can be readily computed : @xmath7 this expression implies full 2d periodicity , and therefore it contains spurious terms if the periodicity is reduced .",
    "our aim is to modify the expression of the coulomb interaction @xmath8 to an effectively truncated interaction : @xmath9 for some suitable region @xmath10 , such that it avoids the interaction of the `` real '' cells with the spurious replicas , while maintaining all interactions between points in the real cells . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", it will be necessary to increase the size of the original unit cell .    for finite systems ( 2d/0d ) the cutoff region",
    "can be conveniently defined as @xmath11 , for some cutoff radius @xmath12 .",
    "we can then easily perform the fourier integral in polar coordinates : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath15 is the generalized hypergeometric function .",
    "note that the @xmath16 case is finite and continuous , and poses no difficulty : the value of @xmath12 must be sufficient to contain all possible interactions in the original unit cell where the charge is contained ; if we imagine it to be a square of radius @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "if we now enlarge this cell ( padding the density with zeros ) to @xmath19 , the spurious replicas will not interact thanks to the interaction cutoff , and the hartree integration will be exact .",
    "the 2d/1d case is more subtle .",
    "we assume the charge density to be contained in a strip defined by @xmath20 : the system is a chain of unit cells along the @xmath21 axis .",
    "we define the cutoff region @xmath10 as @xmath22  and the unit cell is also enlarged in the @xmath23 direction to @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to see that in this manner , the `` ghost '' replicas do not interact with the original chain , but the real interactions are preserved .",
    "the reciprocal space expression for the truncated coulomb potential is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "however , in this case , since @xmath26 , the integral is undefined on the whole line @xmath27 .    in the fully periodic ( 2d/2d ) case",
    ", we also have a singular point at @xmath28 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:2d-2d ] ) ] .",
    "if we assume charge neutrality , this singularity poses no problem . in eq .",
    "( [ defhartreereciproc ] ) the term @xmath29 multiplies @xmath30 , which is zero because this is in fact the charge neutrality condition . in the 2d/1d case",
    ", we must estimate how these divergent terms affect eq .",
    "( [ defhartreereciproc ] ) , or , more precisely , the back fourier transform @xmath31 in order to see how the infinities appear , we consider the integral in eq .",
    "( [ 1dcutoff ] ) for @xmath32 , but using first a finite integration domain also in the @xmath21 direction , @xmath33 .",
    "this integral is convergent .",
    "if we perform the integration and retain only the terms that do not vanish in the limit @xmath34 we obtain @xmath35 the first term , which we call @xmath36 , diverges as @xmath37 .",
    "however , it can easily be seen that it can be ignored if we assume charge neutrality .",
    "we perform the @xmath38 integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : backtransform ] ) for @xmath32 , considering only the @xmath36 term @xmath39 now we have : @xmath40 in the integral @xmath41 , since the charge is contained in that region .",
    "this is the region of interest , and therefore we are also interested in looking at the potential only for @xmath20 . as a consequence , @xmath42 , and we can conclude @xmath43 this is obviously zero if we assume charge neutrality .",
    "therefore we have prooved that we can safely ignore the diverging terms , and retain only the regular ones . with this in mind , the case of @xmath28 is now trivial : @xmath44",
    "to test the cutoff method , we consider 1d qd arrays similar to those in ref .",
    "each rectangular unit cell contains two qds , and each qd has @xmath45 electrons bound by a gaussian positive background charge density .",
    "the total gaussian background charge density has the form @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the average density at the center of the qd .",
    "note the use of eff .",
    "a.u . throughout .",
    "@xcite    we solve the kohn - sham equations within spin - dft on a 2d grid with and without the cutoff method described above . in the former case , the system is periodic only in _ x _ direction , whereas in the latter case it is periodic in both _ x _ and _ y _ directions . for the exchange and correlation we use the 2d local - spin density approximation ( lsda ) with the parametrization of the correlation by attaccalite _",
    "et al_.  @xcite this parametrization has been shown to be more accurate than the form of tanatar and ceperley  @xcite in the partially spin - polarized regime .",
    "@xcite all the numerical calculations are done using the octopus  @xcite code .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_energy ]        we show the fermi energy @xmath51 of a qd chain with three electrons per dot as a function of the lattice constant @xmath52 perpendicular to the chain . the lattice constant in the _ x _ direction",
    "is fixed to @xmath53 . using the cutoff method leads to a very fast convergence , so that at @xmath54 the fermi energy is converged to six digits .",
    "in contrast , without cutoff , i.e. , the system being periodic in both directions , a much larger supercell is needed in order to achieve comparable accuracy .",
    "this is due to the long - range coulomb interaction between parallel qd chains .",
    "therefore , for accurate calculations the cutoff scheme is essential in reducing the cell size and thus the computational cost .",
    "next we focus our attention to the physical effects caused by _ multiple _",
    "parallel qd chains in comparison with a _ single",
    "_ qd chain . in the former case",
    "no cutoff is used so that for @xmath55 we have parallel chains located at @xmath56 . in the latter case ( single chain )",
    "we use the cutoff method with @xmath54 to guarantee a high precision ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fermi_energy ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3_bands ]     ( left ) and @xmath57 ( right ) for a quantum - dot chain with three electrons in each dot . the dotted lines in the left panel correspond to the result with multiple parallel chains at @xmath58 .",
    "the straight lines correspond to the fermi energies . ]",
    "we plot the band structure for a qd chain with three electrons per dot at @xmath53 ( left panel ) , corresponding to the system considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_energy ] .",
    "we find that the presence of parallel chains leads to a rather minor effect on the bands .",
    "the qualitative shape of the structure is very similar , and the shift in the bands due to the interchain effects is of the same order of magnitude as the shift in @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig : n3_bands ] can be also directly compared with the results of ref .",
    "overall , we find an excellent agreement , also in the case of a larger lattice constant @xmath57 ( right panel ) . here",
    "the spin degeneracy is lifted due to the exchange effect which leads to a magnetic ground state .",
    "@xcite next we consider the interchain effects on phase transitions in qd chains . as noted by krkkinen _",
    ",  @xcite the chains have a rich phase diagram with respect to the electron number @xmath45 and the lattice constant @xmath59 .",
    "in general , increasing @xmath59 leads to insulating behavior and/or magnetism , i.e. , spin polarization , depending on @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2_bands ]     for quantum - dot chains with two electrons in each dot .",
    "the left and right panels show the results for a single and multiple chains , leading to to metallic and insulating band structures , respectively . in the latter case ,",
    "the parallel chains are located at @xmath58 . ]",
    "we show the band structure at @xmath60 for two electrons per dot , calculated with the cutoff procedure for a single chain and without the cutoff for multiple parallel chains located at @xmath61 .",
    "the single qd chain is clearly a metal with bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "in contrast the presence of periodic replicas of the chain opens up a gap across the fermi level so that the system becomes an insulator .",
    "the physical origin of the effect is the increased localization of single qds due to coulomb repulsion between the replicas of the chain .",
    "similarly , the single qd chain ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2_bands ] ) becomes an insulator at around @xmath62 , when the dots are more isolated .",
    "finally , we have also examined the interchain effects on the magnetism of qd wires . generally , the spin polarization is relatively stable : for @xmath63 we find similar spin - polarization as a function of the lattice constant regardless of the presence of parallel qd chains . in all cases",
    "the magnetization is in a qualitative agreement with the results in ref .",
    "[ ] , minor differences arising from the use of the lsda parametrization by attaccalite",
    "_ et al_. instead of the one by tanatar and ceperley .",
    "@xcite however , further studies are required regarding the validity of the lsda in the high - correlation regime and/or in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "these would also be ideal systems to test the 2d density functionals recently developed.@xcite",
    "the reciprocal space is the natural venue for treating periodic systems",
    ". if the periodicity is not complete ( the system is not periodic in all the space dimensions ) or even absent , the computations require the use of a large supercell in order to avoid the spurious interactions due to `` ghost '' system replicas ; this is specially manifested in the computation of the coulomb , or hartree , integral , which is a trivial multiplication if we use plane waves . for 3d systems , it has been shown that the use of a screened coulomb interaction greatly improves the accuracy in the calculation of ground states quantities , and substantially simplifies the evaluation of excited - state properties of reduced - periodicity systems . in this work",
    "we have shown that the same ideas can be applied to the case of the 2d electron gas ; we have provided the relevant formulae for finite systems in 2d , and for systems that are periodic in only one dimension .",
    "moreover , the corrective cutoffs are exact and rather straightforward to apply .",
    "we have demonstrated their effectiveness by computing band structures and fermi energies of one - dimensional periodic arrays of quantum dots formed by the confinement of two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "we expect that our technique will be of great interest for studying these novel systems of `` artificial molecules '' and `` crystals '' , although the ubiquity of the problem we have faced will probably make our technique relevant in other fields , too .",
    "all the formulae given here are the same in effective atomic units and in hartree atomic units .",
    "effective atomic units are convenient to account for the background material of quantum - dot systems .",
    "the lengths and energies are then given in @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . here",
