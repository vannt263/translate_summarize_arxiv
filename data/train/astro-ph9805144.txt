    "elemental abundances contain significantly more information than just ` metallicity ' , since different elements are synthesised in stars of different masses , and on different timescales .",
    "in particular , oxygen and the alpha - elements are produced predominantly by massive stars , ejected into the interstellar medium by core - collapse , type ii , supernovae .",
    "iron has important contributions by both type ii supernovae and type ia supernovae , the latter believed to result from the explosive nucleosynthesis of degenerate material , associated with a white dwarf in a binary system .",
    "the vast majority of local stars belonging to the galactic halo population have enhanced values , compared to that of the sun , of the ratio of the abundances of oxygen and of the alpha - elements to that of iron ( e.g. wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 ; nissen et al .",
    "1994 ; gratton et al .",
    "further , these halo stars have very similar values of this ` over - abundance ' of alpha - elements , [ @xmath1/fe]@xmath3 .",
    "this ` halo ' value is , within nucleosynthetic yield uncertainties , just that predicted for chemical enrichment by a mean , imf - averaged , type  ii ( core collapse ) supernova , assuming a normal ( i.e. solar - neighborhood ) massive - star mass function ( wyse & gilmore 1992 ; nissen et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "thus a typical halo star shows no evidence for nucleosynthetic products from type ia supernovae .",
    "this lack restricts the duration of star formation that created these stars to be shorter than the time it takes for there to have occurred significant type ia explosions .",
    "this timescale is rather model - dependent . in the commonly - discussed double - degenerate models ( iben & tutukov 1984 ;",
    "see iben et al .",
    "1997 for a recent discussion , including the expected statistics of close wd binaries ) it is plausibly of order 1  gyr after the formation of the progenitor stars ( e.g. smecker - hane & wyse 1992 ; matteucci & franois 1992 ) .",
    "a similar timescale for significant supernovae follows from models in which the white dwarf is accreting due to roche - lobe overflow from a low - mass , evolved companion ( yungelson & livio 1998 ) .",
    "this restriction on the duration of star formation is not necessarily the same as a restriction on the global age range of the halo , since different regions of the halo could initiate ( short - lived ) star formation at different times , resulting in a significantly larger total age range in the halo ( see also gilroy et al .",
    "1988 for an analogous argument for rapid local enrichment , based on the appearance of @xmath4process elements in metal - poor halo stars ) .",
    "it is very implausible that the duration of star formation across the entire halo was as short as 1  gyr , no matter one s preconceptions of how the halo formed ",
    "if ` monolithic ' , this requires remarkable synchronisation over @xmath5  kpc , while if ` chaotic ' , the regions that formed the halo had remarkably uniform star formation properties .",
    "star formation is likely to occur in transient overdense regions , perhaps of the mass of present - day giant molecular cloud complexes in the galactic disk , even in models that envisage a well - defined ` monolithic ' galactic potential well during the formation of the stellar halo ( e.g. fall & rees 1985 ) .",
    "was there pre - enrichment of one region by another ? did some regions self - enrich sufficiently long to incorporate the products of type ia supernovae ?",
    "isochrone - based determinations of the ages of field halo stars are of limited accuracy , and indeed the only technically - feasible means of detecting an extended duration of star formation that may be as short as a gyr is to identify halo stars with evidence for pre - enrichment by type ia supernovae .",
    "the manifestation of this is lower values of [ @xmath1/fe ] than can be understood from type  ii supernovae alone .",
    "given the expectation of some increase in metallicity with time as star formation proceeds , the most natural place to look for such an effect is among the most chemically - enriched halo stars .",
    "we note that a variation in the massive - star imf can also provide for lower values of element ratios , still with enrichment by only type  ii supernovae",
    ". however , there is firm observational evidence for universality of the imf , surprising as this may be ( see papers in gilmore & howell 1998 ) , and indeed any invoked imf variation to explain lower values of [ @xmath1/fe ] would be extremely _ ad hoc_. thus we favor interpretations within the framework of a fixed imf .",
    "several recent analyses , most notably that by nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) , have discovered exactly the element ratio behavior expected for some enrichment by type ia supernovae .",
    "the authors of these analyses have favored , as the explanation for ` low - alpha ' halo stars , accretion of stars from distinct objects such as satellite dwarf galaxies . here",
    "we argue rather that the observations are more naturally explained by the variation in the duration of star formation in regions of the proto - halo .",
    "fragmentation into cool , dense self - gravitating regions is fairly generic to models of the collapse of galaxy - scale perturbations ; assimilation and mixing of these transient regions is not to be thought of as accretion .",
    "of course , accretion , in the sense of a distinct other proto - galaxy merging into our proto - galaxy , remains a very attractive explanation for the creation of the thick disk ( e.g. gilmore & wyse 1985 ; see velazquez & white 1998 , for a recent simulation ) , some @xmath6  gyr ago ( e.g. gilmore , wyse & jones 1995 ) .",
    "halo stars with low values of the [ @xmath1/fe ] element ratios were identified in a study of metal - rich halo stars , those with [ fe / h ] @xmath7  dex , by nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) , and serendipitously in samples of local , low - metallicity halo stars by king ( 1997 ) and by carney et al .",
    "nissen & schuster studied approximately equal numbers of ` disk ' and ` halo ' dwarfs ( 16 disk , 13 halo ; so designated based on kinematics ) in the metallicity range @xmath8 \\simlt -0.4 $ ] .",
    "two giant stars in each of the ` younger ' ( e.g. richer et al .",
    "1996 ) globular clusters ruprecht  106 and pal  12 were analysed by brown , wallerstein & zucker ( 1997 ) and found to have approximately solar values of alpha - element - to - iron ratios .",
    "figure  1 shows the [ mg / fe ] data , as a function of [ fe / h ] , for the nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) sample of disk and halo stars , plus the anomalous metal - poor halo stars from king ( 1997 ) and carney et al .",

    "each data set shows similar behavior in their regions of overlap in [ fe / h ] .",
    "since it is probable that these offsets reflect differences in analysis methods rather than real systematic variations in [ @xmath1/fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] , we do not consider them further here ) .",
    "as may be seen in the figure , the majority of the metal - rich halo stars observed shows significantly lower values of [ @xmath1/fe ] than the enhanced , super - solar values of the alpha - element ratios derived for the more metal - poor halo stars .",
    "thus the halo stars with enhanced element ratios are ` anomalous ' in this metallicity range .",
    "this contrasts with the typical ( metal - poor ) halo where the stars with low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] are the anomalous ones .",
    "the halo stars of all metallicity with low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] share one property ",
    "they tend to be on orbits with large values of apogalactic distances , @xmath9  kpc , whereas the ` normal ' halo stars are not to so biased to the outer halo .",
    "this trend suggests a real physical meaning to the present orbital parameters .",
    "further , all the halo stars of the nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) sample are on derived orbits with very low perigalactic distances , @xmath10  kpc ; this is consistent with the apparent correlation between @xmath11 and metallicity established for such kinematically - selected samples by ryan & norris ( 1991 ) , such that the more metal - rich halo stars tend to be on orbits of smaller perigalactic distances .",
    "thus all the metal - rich halo stars observed are on orbits with small values of @xmath11 , while of these , the stars with low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] are on orbits with large values of @xmath12 .",
    "note that it is _ not _ the case that all metal - poor halo stars with large @xmath13 necessarily have low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] , although such a trend exists for the metal - rich stars with low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] . as demonstrated in table  10 of carney et al .",
    "( 1997 ) there are many metal - poor stars that have orbits associating them with the outer halo , but that have normal , enhanced , values of the alpha - element ratios .",
    "the metal - poor halo stars with low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] are on retrograde orbits ( king 1997 ; carney et al .",
    "1997 ) , but there is no such signature in the kinematics of the metal - rich stars with low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "we wish to understand why a small fraction of stars in the stellar halo , biased to metal - rich stars on high - energy , high - eccentricity orbits , have low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "consider the pattern of element ratios in self - enriching systems ( of fixed imf ) with given star formation rates .",
    "the solid lines in figure  1 illustrate schematically the trends produced in simple ( homogeneous ) models of chemical evolution with differing star formation rates .",
    "the important feature is the location of the turndown due to iron from type ia supernovae  since the _ shortest _ pre - explosion lifetime of type ia supernovae is presumed to be a fixed value , the location of this turndown occurs at a higher value of [ fe / h ] for a higher star formation rate , reflecting the more rapid metallicity increase with time ( note that the effect of gas flows on the location of the turndown from the ` type ii plateau ' at early times / lower metallicities can be incorporated by a suitably - modified star - formation rate ; inflow of unenriched material will reduce [ fe / h ] keeping [ @xmath1/fe ] fixed .",
    "outflow driven by type ii supernovae will behave similarly ) .",
    "such an effect has been proposed to explain the element ratios seen in local disk stars , born at different locations in the disk ( edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows that the observed differences in element ratio patterns are inevitable consequences of a variation of the star formation rate .",
    "the amplitude of the invoked variation in star formation rates is required only to be such as to allow up to @xmath14  gyr longer duration of star formation to produce lower values of [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "this difference in age ranges is undetectable with current isochrone - based techniques .",
    "note that there is no requirement from the element ratio data that the progenitor stars of the type ia supernovae be part of the same star forming region as the gas they will eventually enrich .",
    "however , the observed trend for low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] to be observed for higher - metallicity halo stars favors rather self - enrichment scenarios , in ( sub)structure of relatively deep potential wells .    clearly , the data are consistent with the lower [ @xmath1/fe ] stars forming over longer timescales , allowing incorporation of iron from type ia supernovae . but where did these halo stars form ? in a distinct separate galaxy , or essentially where we observe them now ?",
    "nissen & schuster ( 1997 ) considered two possibilities , either that the outer regions of the stellar halo of the galaxy had a longer duration of star formation than did the inner halo , or that the halo stars with low values of [ @xmath1/fe ] were accreted from a dwarf galaxy within which star formation is presumed to have been sustained over a sufficiently long period , longer than in the field halo .",
    "the authors favor the latter explanation . indeed , ` distinct accretion events ' are the preferred explanation of all the authors for the data in figure  1 , and also for the ` anomalous ' globular clusters ( it has been suggested that these two clusters have been captured from the large magellanic cloud ; lin & richer 1992 ) .",
    "motivation for the interpretation in terms of ` accretion ' came partially from the prediction of low values of the alpha - element to iron ratios in the stars of dwarf galaxies in which there is extended star formation , perhaps even successive bursts of star formation , as inferred for many of the extant satellite galaxies associated with the milky way ( gilmore & wyse 1991 ; unavane , wyse & gilmore 1996 ) .",
    "it is clear from observations that only the more massive dwarf systems can self - enrich to a metallicity of 1/10 the solar value ( see , for example the metallicity  luminosity ( mass ) relation of lee et al .",
    "1993 ) . of the local dwarf galaxy companions to the milky way , only the fornax dsph , the sagittarius dsph and the magellanic clouds have a significant population of stars as metal - rich as the observed low - alpha halo stars .",
    "however , these systems also contain stars of a wide range of ages ( e.g. smecker - hane 1996 ) , and late accretion of stars from systems like these satellite galaxies would produce stars in the halo which are _ many _ gyr younger than the bulk of the halo , reflecting the star - formation history of the satellite galaxy parent .",
    "the present sample of ` low - alpha ' halo stars shows no obvious signature of having a relative youth of this amplitude , which would be manifest in their colors ( e.g. unavane , wyse & gilmore 1996 ) .",
    "thus late accretion from systems like the extant satellite galaxies is not favored .",
    "what other kind of accretion is possible ?",
    "models of the formation of the stellar halo generically invoke early star formation in transient @xmath15  m@xmath16 local potential wells , perhaps reflecting the initial primordial fluctuation power spectrum , or formed by thermal and/or gravitational instability within a larger system . the turn - around , collapse and relaxation to dynamical equilibrium of the present - day galactic potential takes at least a couple of global dynamical times , or a few gyr .",
    "thus disruption and assimilation of transient systems during the relaxation of the large - scale galactic potential should not be considered as ` accretion ' , since these systems never really had a separate identity .",
    "systems that do retain coherence through this period can be said to be ` accreted ' if assimilated subsequently , and it is these we consider next .",
    "since we are discussing essentially old stars , we shall focus on the stellar components of this substructure ; in any case a satellite galaxy would be most likely stripped of its gas after a few passages through the gaseous disk of the milky way with perigalactic distances like those observed for the halo stars .    `",
    "substructure ' orbiting within the ( dark halo ) potential of a larger ` parent ' galaxy is subject to tidal forces , and to dynamical friction .",
    "the mass and the ( mean ) density of the substructure will to a large extent determine its fate .",
    "dynamical friction will cause the orbit of the substructure to decay in radius , on a timescale inversely proportional to the mass of the substructure ( for given orbit and large galaxy ) ; relatively massive substructure will sink to the center of the larger galaxy on a few orbital times .",
    "tidal stripping will cause the substructure to lose material when its internal gravity is overcome by the gravitational field of the larger galaxy ; the simple jacobi criterion implies that a system will lose material unless ( or until ) its internal density is of order three times the mean density of the larger galaxy interior to its orbit ; simulations have shown that this simple criterion works remarkably well ( e.g. johnston , hernquist & bolte 1996 ) .",
    "diffuse substructure will lose material while orbiting even in the far outer regions of the larger galaxy .",
    "the orbits of stars that have been accreted into the galaxy by tidal effects on a satellite galaxy are only slightly different from that of the satellite at the time the stars were captured ; this produces a kinematic signature of moving groups of stripped stars , that can persist for many orbital times ( cf .",
    "tremaine 1993 ; johnston 1998 ) .",
    "thus one may consider four broad classes of dissipationless ( stars plus dark matter ) substructure : massive , dense systems will survive fairly intact while sinking to the center of the larger galaxy ; massive , diffuse systems will be largely disrupted by tides during their orbital decay ; low mass , dense systems will be largely unaffected , while low mass , diffuse systems will be disrupted with no orbital decay .",
    "the stars under consideration here are on rather eccentric orbits , but with even @xmath12 much less than that of typical extant satellite galaxies . as discussed by velazquez & white ( 1998 ) , for example , in their study of the interaction between satellite galaxies and large disk galaxies , _ local _ application of the standard ( chandrasekhar ) dynamical friction formula",
    "provides reliable results in the case of non - circular orbits .",
    "thus due to the higher densities in the central regions of the bigger galaxy , the frictional effects are higher there .",
    "further , most tidal stripping occurs at pericenter passage ( e.g. velazquez & white 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "thus if the observed halo stars were removed from a satellite galaxy by tidal stripping , their very low perigalactic distances would require that the satellite galaxy be able to penetrate deep inside the milky way .",
    "their low values of @xmath12 also would , in this scenario , require a rather massive satellite , so that dynamical fraction can operate on less than a hubble time .",
    "the perigalactic distances provide the more stringent constraint . as discussed above , the low [ @xmath1/fe ]",
    "stars are on radial orbits , with perigalactic distances @xmath17  kpc , and indeed the majority of the stars having @xmath10  kpc . a lower limit to the mean density of the milky way galaxy interior to 1  kpc",
    "is given by adopting just the mass of the central bulge , @xmath18 ( e.g. kent 1992 ) .",
    "the predominant stellar populations in the galactic bulge and inner disk are probably at least @xmath19  gyr old ( ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ; holtzman et al . 1993 ) , consistent with theoretical expectations for the timescale of assembly of the ` core ' of the milky way in hierarchical - clustering models ( e.g. lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "thus one may use inferences from the mass distribution of the inner galaxy to constrain the fate of substructure back to that time .    the mean density interior to the perigalactic approach ( @xmath20  kpc ) of the ` low - alpha ' stars is then @xmath21  m@xmath16  pc@xmath22 . to be robust against tides ,",
    "a satellite galaxy on an orbit with this small a perigalactic distance would need an mean internal density of around three times this , or @xmath23",
    "m@xmath16  pc@xmath22 .",
    "this value is significantly larger ( by orders of magnitude ) than the typical mean densities derived for dwarf galaxies , both gas - poor and gas - rich ( e.g. puche & carignan 1991 ; ibata et al .",
    "thus essentially all dwarf galaxies as we see them now ( presumably the survivors ) would be disrupted after only a couple of such pericenter passages ( see johnston , hernquist & bolte 1996 ) . indeed , they would likely be disrupted significantly earlier in their orbital decay , when the pericenter distances are of order the present derived apocenter distances of the anomalous halo stars ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "thus , if the halo stars under discussion represent stars captured from a satellite galaxy , that galaxy had to be sufficiently massive to spiral into the center of the milky way in less than a hubble time  this implies a mass perhaps 10% that of the older stars in the central milky way , or equal to the entire mass of the stellar halo ( e.g. carney , latham & laird 1990 ) .",
    "this satellite had also to be significantly more robust than any of the extant satellite galaxies ( the survivors ) .",
    "if this satellite contributed to the formation of the thick disk , it did so without donating any of its own stars to the disk .",
    "each of these is rather surprising .",
    "the requirements for the progenitor structures for the metal - rich , ` low - alpha ' halo stars may be summarised as being dense enough to survive to a perigalactic distance of @xmath20  kpc , and have a deep enough local potential well to self - enrich to @xmath24  dex , while sustaining star formation for @xmath20  gyr , being robust not only to internal feedback from star formation , but also external effects .",
    "plausibly the first two of these requirements are satisfied by a density criterion for the substructure , given that the escape energy per unit mass scales as @xmath25 .",
    "sustaining star formation requires gas retention , and the further requirement that the effects of collisions with other star - forming clouds , or passages through the ( forming ) gas disk of the galaxy , be minimised .    as discussed by many authors ( see e.g. gunn 1980 ; jones , palmer & wyse 1981 ) gravitational instability in the cooling layers behind shocked gas in the haloes of protogalaxies produces systems of density @xmath26m@xmath16pc@xmath22 and of characteristic ( jeans ) mass of a few times @xmath27m@xmath16 .",
    "a more sophisticated analysis by fall & rees ( 1985 ) included thermal instability in the hot , gaseous halo of a proto - galaxy , like the milky way , to produce cool , dense regions , that are seeds for gravitational instability .",
    "fall & rees ( 1985 ) argue that a fairly massive proto - galaxy , with circular velocity greater than @xmath28  km / s , is required for this scenario ( essentially to provide the hot phase of the gaseous halo ) . in flat cold - dark - matter dominated cosmologies ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ) , dark haloes of this circular velocity have peak abundance at redshifts @xmath29 , or lookback times of @xmath30  gyr .",
    "thus this picture of fragmentation inside dark haloes is reasonable even in hierarchical clustering scenarios .",
    "the fragments undergo star formation and are subsequently dispersed , either by the internal effects of star formation , or the external effects of cloud - cloud collisions or tidal disruption by the galactic potential .",
    "it is plausible that the fragments probing smaller galactocentric distance have larger internal densities ( indeed , as predicted by the model of fall & rees 1985 ) and larger escape velocities , allowing greater self - enrichment and thus providing a relation between r@xmath31 and [ fe / h ] as observed in the remnant stars , now the field halo ( higher metallicity for lower r@xmath31 ; ryan & norris 1991 ) .",
    "the most dense regions could plausibly form globular clusters , as suggested by fall & rees ( 1985 ) , even some of which are subsequently destroyed ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .    the bias to large apogalactic distances for the orbits of the ` low - alpha ' stars follows naturally from the expected longer survival times of large , self - enriching clouds in the outer regions of proto - galaxy , due to the longer collision times there , and the larger orbital times .",
    "additionally , a large - scale density gradient could provide slower local star formation rates in the outer regions , provided the properties of density perturbations correlate with their local background .",
    "thus fragmentation would appear to provide the kind of substructure required by the observations .",
    "a striking aspect of the data in figure 1 is that the value of the ` type  ii plateau ' of element ratios is the same for the halo stars as for the disk stars of the same metallicity .",
    "following the same logic as wyse & gilmore ( 1992 ) , this implies that the imf of the ( massive ) stars that enriched these stars was the same in the early disk and halo .",
    "inversion of the value of the element ratios to determine the actual slope of the massive star imf requires adoption of theoretical supernova yields and is hence uncertain , but the robust statement that the imf was invariant in the enrichment of disk and halo may be made immediately .",
    "it is also clear from figure 1 that most of the metal - rich halo stars do not have element ratios equal to this ` type ii plateau ' , and that the _ typical _ halo and disk stars of equal metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath32  dex ) do _ not _ have the same values of the element ratios .",
    "there is not the smooth continuity in chemical enrichment from halo to disk often derived in models of chemical evolution .",
    "of course , these halo stars are on orbits of very different angular momentum than those of the disk stars , further emphasizing the distinction between local samples of disk and halo , and the low likelihood that the halo , as sampled , pre - enriched the disk ( see wyse & gilmore 1992 ; gilmore 1995 ) .",
    "there is also a spread in [ fe / h ] at fixed values of [ mg / fe ] ; as mentioned earlier in section 3 , this may be achieved by different gas flows / mixing and star formation histories .",
    "the onset of star formation in the local disk , as measured by the white dwarf luminosity function , has most recently been estimated to be 1012  gyr ago ( an increase over earlier estimates , in part due to the inclusion of phase separation and crystallisation energy in the white dwarf cooling curves ; hernanz et al .",
    "1994 ; chabrier 1998 ) .",
    "this older age is in agreement with the ages of the oldest open clusters ( e.g. phelps 1997 ) and the age of the thick disk ( e.g. gilmore , wyse & jones 1995 ) and in better agreement with the ages of individual stars from edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ; see also ng & bertelli 1998 for post - hipparcos age estimates for stars from this sample ) .",
    "the recent downward revision in the ages of the halo globular clusters to @xmath6  gyr , based on hipparcos calibrations of the luminosities of field subdwarfs ( e.g. gratton et al . 1997b ; reid 1998 ) , leaves little room for a significant hiatus between the epoch of halo star formation and the onset of star formation in the disk ( however , this calibration depends on many corrections and is not unique  see e.g. pont et al .",
    "it would follow that disk and halo were independent entities from the very early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "the recent observations of halo stars with elemental abundances reflecting pre - enrichment from intermediate - mass stars and type ia supernovae can be understood in many models of halo formation .",
    "the establishment of trends with kinematics , suggested at in the present data , will be important in distinguishing models , as will be age determinations .",
    "the fact that the ` low - alpha ' halo stars tend to be metal - rich favors self - enrichment scenarios , and the survival of individual star - forming complexes for approximately a gyr . that the observed low - alpha stars are on orbits that plunge close to the galactic center also implies that a reasonably robust parent system is required .",
    "we argue for an interpretation that simply appeals to a small variation in the duration of star formation within regions of the stellar halo , rather than ` distinct accretion events ' .",
    "the present data implicates a significant fraction of the metal - rich , outer halo .",
    "one may normalise to the stellar halo as a whole , using the metallicity distribution for local halo stars of carney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in which @xmath33% of the stellar halo has [ fe / h]@xmath34  dex , combined with the halo structural parameters of unavane , wyse & gilmore ( 1996 ) in which @xmath35% of the halo is located beyond @xmath36  kpc , to conclude that at most a few percent ( 10% times 15% ) of the stellar halo is being discussed .",
    "more data  not restricted to detailed elemental abundances for selected halo stars  will clearly help to substantiate these estimates .",
    "for example , the metallicity distribution of the halo is derived from local , kinematically - selected samples , and the inner halo is poorly studied .",
    "further , there is currently little information about the _ wings _ of the metallicity distribution of the stellar halo .    the present data for disk and halo stars of ` overlapping ' metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath37  dex show a disk  halo dichotomy , in that the elemental abundances are different for typical disk stars and for typical halo stars in this metallicity range , with the halo stars having lower values of [ @xmath1/fe ] than the disk stars .",
    "this complicates the requirements for chemical evolution models for the disk that appeal to gas inflow from the halo ; indeed if the halo had ejected gas that pre - enriched the disk , one might have expected the opposite situation , with the disk stars having lower values of element ratios than the halo stars .",
    "a simplification of chemical evolution models is that the elemental abundance data favor a fixed massive - star imf for both disk and halo .",

    "<S> it is well - established that the vast majority of metal - poor galactic halo stars shows evidence for enrichment by solely massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations have identified more varied behavior in the pattern of elemental abundances measured for metal - rich , [ fe / h]@xmath0  dex , halo stars , with both high and low values of the ratio of [ @xmath1/fe ] . </S>",
    "<S> the low values are most naturally due to the incorporation of iron from type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> these ` low - alpha ' halo stars have been interpreted as being accreted from dwarf galaxies . however , these stars are on very high - energy radial orbits , that plunge into the galactic center , from the outer regions of the stellar halo . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate here that known dwarf galaxies could not reproduce the observations , which require the proposed parent dwarf to have a very high mean density to provide ` low - alpha ' stars on orbits of such low values of perigalactic distance . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the observations are consistent with fragmentation of a gaseous proto - halo into transient star - forming regions , some of which are sufficiently dense to survive close to the galactic center , and self - enrich to relatively high metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> those that probe the outer halo sustain star formation long enough to incorporate the ejecta from type ia supernovae .    </S>",
    "<S> further , we point out that the values of the ` type ii plateau ' in the element ratios for disk stars and for halo stars are equal . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the ( massive ) stars that enriched the early disk and halo had the same imf . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bulk of the halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath2  dex that have been observed have significantly lower values of [ @xmath1/fe ] than does a typical disk star of that metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is a discontinuity in the chemical enrichment history between the halo and disk , as probed by these samples , consistent with previous inferences based on angular momentum considerations . </S>"
