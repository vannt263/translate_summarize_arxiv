    "in recent years single - molecule pulling techniques based on the use of laser optical tweezers ( lot ) or atomic force microscope ( afm ) have gained prominence as a versatile tool in the studies of non - covalent bonds and self - associating bio - molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the latter could be exemplified by the base - pair binding in dna as well as by ligand - receptor interactions in proteins and has been studied recently by means of brownian dynamic simulations and the master equation approach @xcite .",
    "the lot and afm methods are commonly used to manipulate and exert mechanical forces on individual molecules . in lot experiments ,",
    "a micron - sized polystyrene or silica bead is trapped in the focus of the laser beam by exerting forces in the range @xmath2 .",
    "typically , afm ( which covers forces interval in @xmath3 range ) is ideal for investigations of relatively strong inter- or intramolecular interactions which are involved in pulling experiments in biopolymers such as polysaccharides , proteins and nucleic acids . on the other hand , due to the relatively small signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", the afm experiments have limitations with regard to the mechanochemistry of weak interactions in the lower piconewton regime .",
    "the method of dynamic force spectroscopy ( dfs ) is used to probe the force - extension relationship , rupture force distribution , and the force vs loading rate dependence for single - molecule bonds or for more complicated multiply - bonded attachments .",
    "historically , the first theoretical interpretation of dfs has been suggested in the context of single cell adhesion by bell @xcite and developed by evans @xcite .",
    "the consideration has been based on the semi - phenomenological arrhenius relation which describes surface detachment under time - dependent pulling force , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the loading rate .",
    "it was also assumed that the effective activation energy , @xmath6 , may be approximated by a linear function of the force , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 is the distance between the bonded state and the transition state where the activation barrier is located .",
    "the resulting bell - evans ( be ) equation then gives the mean detachment force as a function of temperature @xmath9 and loading rate @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the desorption rate in the absence of applied pulling force .",
    "as one can see from this be - equation , the simple surmounting of be - activation barrier results in a linear dependence of detachment force on the logarithm of loading rate , provided one uses the applied force as a governing parameter in the detachment process ( i.e. , working in an _ isotensional _ ensemble when @xmath12 is controlled and the distance @xmath13 from the substrate to the clamped end - monomer of the polymer chain fluctuates ) . for multiply - bonded attachments",
    "the interpretation problem based on this equation becomes more complicated since a non - linear @xmath14 relationship is observed @xcite . in this case chain detachment",
    "involves passages over a cascade of activation barriers .",
    "for example , merkel et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the net rate of detachments can be approximated by a reciprocal sum of characteristic times , corresponding to jumps over the single barriers .",
    "in particular , regarding the detachment of biotin - streptavidin single bonds , it was suggested that two consecutive barriers might be responsible for the desorption process .",
    "a simple example of multiply - bonded bio - assembly is presented by a singe - stranded dna ( ssdna ) macromolecule , strongly adsorbed on graphite substrate .",
    "the forced - induced desorption ( or peeling ) of this biopolymer has been studied analytically and by means of brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulation by jagota et al",
    ". @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of ssdna forced - induced desorption under force control ( fc ) and displacement control ( dc ) has been investigated . in the latter case one",
    "works in an _ isometric _ ensemble where @xmath13 is controlled and @xmath12 fluctuates .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the force response under dc exhibits a series of spikes which carry information about the underlying base sequence of ssdna .",
    "the brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations @xcite confirmed the existence of such force spikes in the force - displacement curves under dc .",
    "the nonequilibrium theory of forced desorption has been developed by kreuzer et al .",
    "@xcite on the basis of master equation approach for the cases of constant velocity and force - ramp modes in an afm - experiment .",
    "the authors assumed that individual monomers detachments represent a fast process as compared to the removal of all monomers .",
    "this justifies a two - state model where all monomers either remain on the substrate or leave it abruptly .",
    "the corresponding transition rates ( which constitute a necessary input in the master equation approach ) must satisfy detailed balance . as a result of the master equation solution , the authors obtained a probability distribution of detachment heights ( i.e. , distances between the cantilever tip and the substrate ) as well as an average detachment height as a function of the pulling velocity .    irrespective of all these efforts , a detailed theoretical interpretation of the dynamic force spectroscopy experiments is still missing . for example , in terms of kramers reaction - rate theory @xcite the arrhenius - like be - model holds only when the effective activation energy @xmath15 . on the other hand , it is clear that for large forces ( which we experience in afm ) , the case when @xmath16 occurs fairly often . in this common case",
    "the general approach , based on the be - model , becomes questionable . besides",
    ", it can be shown @xcite , that the activation energy vs force dependence , @xmath17 , is itself a _ nonlinear _ function , so that the conventional be - model , based on the linear approximation , @xmath18 , should be limited to small forces .",
    "moreover , the arrhenius - like relationship for the detachment rate , which was used in the be - model , is a consequence of a saddle - point approximation for the stationary solution of fokker- planck equation @xcite .",
    "this contradicts the typical loading regimes , used in experiments , where applied force or distance grow linearly with time .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the theoretical investigation of a single molecule desorption dynamics and aimed at interpretation of afm - or lot - based dynamic force spectroscopy in the dc constant - velocity mode .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ second_section ] we give the equilibrium theory of detachment for the case of strong polymer adsorption .",

    "@xcite ) can be clearly seen . in sec .",
    "[ sec_dynamics ] we give a dynamical version of the detachment process .",
    "our approach rests on construction of general free energy functions , depending on coarse - grained variables , which govern the non - linear response and structural bonding changes in presence of external forces .",
    "the corresponding free - energy - based stochastic equations ( known as onsager equations @xcite ) are derived and solved numerically .",
    "this solution makes it possible to provide not only force - displacement diagrams and the ensuing dependence on cantilever displacement velocity @xmath0 but also the detachment force probability distribution function ( pdf ) . in sec",
    "[ sec_md ] the main theoretical results are then checked against extensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation .",

    "recently we suggested a theory of the force - induced polymer desorption ( for relatively weak adsorption energy ) in the isotensional @xcite and isometric @xcite equilibrium ensembles supported by extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . in the former case ,",
    "the fraction of adsorbed monomers changes abruptly ( undergoes a jump ) when one varies the adsorption energy or the external pulling force . in the second case ,",
    "the order parameter varies steadily with changing height of the afm - tip , even though the phase transition is still of first order .",
    "the total phase diagram in terms of adsorption energy - pulling force , or , adsorption energy - end - monomer height , has been discussed theoretically and in terms of mc - simulations .    on the other hand , the afm experiments deal with relatively strong forces ( @xmath19 @xcite ) so that in the case of a single molecule desorption experiment only a really strong adsorption energy is essential .",

    "<S> forced detachment of a single polymer chain , strongly - adsorbed on a solid substrate , is investigated by two complementary methods : a coarse - grained analytical dynamical model , based on the onsager stochastic equation , and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with langevin thermostat . </S>",
    "<S> the suggested approach makes it possible to go beyond the limitations of the conventional bell - evans model . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a series of characteristic force spikes when the pulling force is measured against the cantilever displacement during detachment at constant velocity @xmath0 ( displacement control mode ) and find that the average magnitude of this force increases as @xmath0 grows . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distributions of the pulling force and the end - monomer distance from the surface at the moment of final detachment are investigated for different adsorption energy @xmath1 and pulling velocity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our extensive md - simulations validate and support the main theoretical findings . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the simulation reveals a novel behavior : for a strong - friction and massive cantilever the force spikes pattern is smeared out at large @xmath0 . as a challenging task for experimental bio - polymers sequencing in future </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the fabrication of stiff , super - light , nanometer - sized afm probe . </S>"
