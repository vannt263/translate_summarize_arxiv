    "in the last several decades many new materials with intriguing properties were discovered and synthesized .",
    "these materials range from the high - temperature superconductors to magnetic materials , and the latter have already found real applications in electronic industry .",
    "typically , most of these materials contain elements from the 3@xmath0 or 4@xmath3 rows and their electronic structure is characterized by the presence of a partially filled narrow band across the fermi level .",
    "the fact that the narrow band is partially filled implies that there are many configurations with approximately equal weight rendering a one - particle description of the electronic structure problematic .",
    "indeed , it has been recognized for a long time that many of the intriguing properties of these materials originate from correlations among the electrons residing in the partially filled narrow band .",
    "the electrons are neither fully localized , like core electrons , nor itinerant , like @xmath4 or @xmath5 electrons in alkalis or conventional semiconductors such as silicon or diamond .",
    "this hybrid property poses a tremendous theoretical difficulty for an accurate description of the electronic structure , because due to the electrons partially itinerant character the problem can neither be treated as a purely atomic problem nor within a pure band picture .",
    "moreover , the interaction with other electrons can be very important .",
    "a large amount of work has been directed to solving the correlation problem of the above materials .",
    "the usual approach is to consider only the narrow bands near the fermi level and eliminate the degrees of freedom for the rest of the bands by the downfolding procedure , resulting in the well - known hubbard model which contains an effective on - site coulomb interaction , the hubbard @xmath6 . in general , the models represent multi - band systems containing interorbital as well as long - ranged part of coulomb interaction .",
    "the models can then be solved with various sophisticated low - energy solvers such as dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite or solvers for lattice models @xcite .",
    "an important issue in mapping the real system to a model hamiltonian is how to determine the one - particle kinetic energy term and the effective interaction or the hubbard _ u _ in the model . unlike the one - particle parameters that can be downfolded from the band structure , the hubbard _ u _ is much more elusive to determine and it is often treated as an adjustable parameter . a widely used scheme to calculate the hubbard _ u _ from first - principles is the constrained lda ( clda ) method @xcite .",
    "the clda method , however , is known from early on to yield values of @xmath6 , which are too large in some cases ( e.g. late transition metals ) .",
    "it has been argued that this arises from technical difficulty in including transitions of electrons between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 space contributing the screening processes .",
    "this oversight leads in some cases to a larger value of _ u _ @xcite .",
    "recent extensions of the clda method may be found in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "another method for determining the effective interaction is a scheme based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "early attempts along this direction can be found in refs.@xcite . a combined clda and rpa method to circumvent the difficulty was also proposed @xcite .",
    "some years ago a scheme for calculating the hubbard _ u _ , called the constrained rpa ( crpa ) scheme @xcite , was proposed .",
    "the main merit of the crpa method over currently available methods is that it allows for a precise elimination of screening channels , which are instead to be included in a more sophisticated treatment of the model hamiltonian .",
    "this is a controlled approximation without any ambiguity , expected to become asymptotically exact if the @xmath1-space becomes well separated from the @xmath0 space .",
    "moreover , the effective screened interaction can be calculated as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 , independent of the basis functions .",
    "this allows easy access to obtaining not only on - site matrix elements but also off - site matrix elements as well as screened exchange matrix elements , which are usually taken to be the atomic value .",
    "another merit is the possibility of obtaining the frequency - dependent hubbard _ u _ , which may prove to be important .",
    "the crpa method has now been applied to a number of systems with success @xcite .",
    "although the crpa method is rather general , its applications to real systems have revealed a serious technical problem .",
    "the problem arises when the narrow band is entangled with other bands , i.e. , it is not completely isolated from the rest of the bands .",
    "in many materials , the narrow band of interest is entangled . even in simple materials such as the 3@xmath0 transition metals ,",
    "the 3@xmath0 bands mix with the 4@xmath4 and 4@xmath5 bands .",
    "similarly , the 4@xmath3 bands of the 4@xmath3 metals hybridize with the more extended @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands . for such cases ,",
    "it is not clear anymore which part of the polarization should be eliminated when calculating the hubbard @xmath6 using the crpa method .",
    "some procedures to overcome the problem of determining _ u _ for entangled bands have been attempted .",
    "one of these is to choose a set of band indices and define the bands of hubbard model as those bands corresponding to the chosen indices .",
    "another alternative is to introduce an energy window and define the hubbard bands to be those that have energy within the energy window .",
    "yet another alternative is to have a combination of energy window and band indices .",
    "these procedures , however , suffer from a number of difficulties . when choosing band indices it is inevitable that some of the states will have a character very different from that of the intended model .",
    "for example , in the case of 3@xmath0 transition metals , choosing five  3@xmath0 \" bands will include at some @xmath10-points states which have little 3@xmath0 character , with a considerable 4@xmath4 component instead .",
    "moreover , the chosen bands will be awkward to model since they do not form smoothly connected bands .",
    "a similar problem is encountered when choosing an energy window . a combination of band indices and energy window proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite partially solves the problem but it suffers from arbitrariness .",
    "another procedure is , as we will discuss in detail later , to project the polarization to the orbitals of interest , e.g. , 3@xmath0 orbitals , but this procedure has been found to yield an unphysical result of negative static _",
    "u_. in this work , we offer a solution to the problem of determining the hubbard _ u _ for entangled bands .",
    "the basic idea is to disentangle the narrow bands of interest from the rest and carry out the crpa calculation for the disentangled band structure , not using the original band structure .",
    "the disentangling procedure is described in sec.[sec : method ] .",
    "we apply the method to 3@xmath0 transition metals in sec.[sec : result ] and show that the method is numerically stable and yields reasonable values of @xmath6 .",
    "finally the paper is summarized in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "in the crpa method we first choose a one - particle subspace @xmath11 , which defines the model hamiltonian , and label the rest of the hilbert space by @xmath12 .",
    "we define @xmath13 to be the polarization within the @xmath0 subspace and the total polarization is written as @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to realize that the rest of the polarization @xmath15 is _ not _ * * the same as the polarization of the @xmath1 subspace because it contains polarization arising from transitions between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 subspaces .",
    "since @xmath13 is the polarization of the model hamiltonian , this polarization should be subtracted out from the total polarization when the effective parameter of the model is determined .",
    "the effective coulomb interaction @xmath16 should be calculated with the rest of the polarization @xmath17 : @xmath18^{-1}v\\label{wr } \\;,%\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "it can indeed be shown @xcite that the fully screened interaction is given by @xmath20^{-1}w_{r } \\;.\\ ] ] this mathematical identity ensures that @xmath16 can be interpreted as the effective interaction among the electrons residing in the @xmath0 subspace since the screening of @xmath16 by @xmath13 leads to the fully screened interaction .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath16 in some localized functions can then be regarded as the frequency - dependent hubbard _ u_. it has been shown that the formula in eq.([wr ] ) is formally exact , provided @xmath17 is the difference between the exact polarization @xmath14 and the exact polarization of the @xmath0 subspace @xmath13 . in the crpa  method , @xmath17 is calculated within the random - phase approximation .",
    "if the @xmath0 subspace forms an isolated set of bands , as for example in the case of the @xmath21 bands in srvo@xmath22 , the crpa method can be straightforwardly applied .",
    "however , in practical applications , the @xmath0 subspace may not always be readily identified .",
    "an example of these is provided by the 3@xmath0 transition metal series where the 3@xmath0 bands , which are usually taken to be the @xmath0 subspace , do not form an isolated set of bands but rather they are entangled with the 4@xmath4 and 4@xmath5 bands . to handle these cases",
    "we propose the following procedure .",
    "we first construct a set of localized wannier orbitals from a given set of bands defined within a certain energy window .",
    "these wannier orbitals may be generated by following the post - processing procedure of souza , marzari and vanderbilt @xcite or other methods , such as the preprocessing scheme proposed by andersen _",
    "et al . _ within the nth - order muffin - tin orbital ( nmto ) method @xcite .",
    "we then choose this set of wannier orbitals as the generators of the @xmath0 subspace and use them as a basis for diagonalizing the one - particle hamiltonian , which is usually the kohn - sham hamiltonian in the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the so obtained set of bands , which equivalently define the @xmath0 subspace , may be slightly different from the original bands defined within the chosen energy window , because hybridization effects between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spaces are neglected .",
    "however , it is important to confirm that the dispersions near the fermi level well reproduces the original kohn - sham bands . from these bands",
    "we calculate the polarization @xmath23 as @xmath24 \\ ; , \\label{eq : pd}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath27 are the wavefunctions and eigenvalues obtained from diagonalizing the one - particle hamiltonian in the wannier basis .",
    "it would seem sensible to define the rest of the polarization as @xmath28 where @xmath14 is the full polarization calculated using the _ original _ ( kohn - sham ) wavefunctions and eigenvalues @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 , and calculate @xmath16 according to eq.([wr ] ) .",
    "we have found , however , that this procedure is numerically very unstable , resulting in some cases to unphysically negative static @xmath6 and a large oscillation as a function of frequency .",
    "this is understandable given that @xmath14 and @xmath32 are obtained from two different band structures , so that low energy screening channels associated with the @xmath0-@xmath0 transitions are not excluded from @xmath33 completely .",
    "due to the singular nature of the expression in eq.([wr ] ) these low - energy excitations can cause a large fluctuation in @xmath16 .",
    "another way of calculating @xmath33 is to project the wavefunctions to the @xmath0 space ,    @xmath34    where the projection operator @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36    the effective @xmath0 polarization may be expressed as @xmath37 \\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath38 can be used to calculate @xmath39 .",
    "we found that this procedure does not work either and is again unstable .",
    "this problem may be related to the fact that @xmath40 s are not orthogonal with each other and transitions between the states do not correspond to single particle - hole excitations .",
    "based on these observations we propose the following procedure .",
    "we define the @xmath1 subspace by @xmath41 which is orthogonal to the @xmath0 subspace constructed from the wannier orbitals . in practice",
    "it is convenient to orthonormalize @xmath42 and prepare @xmath43 basis functions . by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in this subspace a new set of wavefunctions @xmath44 and eigenvalues @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 are obtained . as a consequence of orthogonalizing @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the set of @xmath1 bands @xmath45 are completely disentangled from those of the @xmath0 space @xmath49 , and they are slightly different from the original band structure @xmath50 .",
    "as we will see later , however , the numerical tests show that the disentangled band structure is close to the original one .",
    "the hubbard @xmath6 is calculated according to eq.([wr ] ) with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the full polarization calculated for the _ disentangled _ band structure .",
    "it is important to realize that the screening processes between the @xmath0 space and the @xmath1 space are included in @xmath6 , although the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling is cut off in the construction of the wavefunctions and eigenvalues .",
    "as an illustration we apply the method to 3@xmath0 transition metals .",
    "the electronic structure calculations are done in the local density approximation @xcite of density functional theory @xcite with the full - potential lmto implementation @xcite .",
    "the wavefunctions are expanded by @xmath53 mtos and a @xmath54 * k*-mesh is used for the brillouin zone summation .",
    "spin polarization is neglected .",
    "more technical details are found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : band](a ) shows the kohn - sham band structure of nickel .",
    "there are five orbitals having strong 3@xmath0 character at [ -5 ev:1 ev ] , crossed by a dispersive state which is of mainly 4@xmath4 character . using the maximally localized wannier function prescription with the energy window of [ -7 ev:3 ev ] , interpolated `` @xmath0 ''",
    "bands are obtained .",
    "the subsequent disentangling procedure gives the associated `` @xmath1 '' bands .",
    "comparing fig.[fig : band](b ) with ( a ) we can see that there is no anti - crossing between the @xmath0 bands and the @xmath1 bands in ( b ) .",
    "otherwise the two band structures are nearly identical .    in order to see the impact of the disentanglement on the screening effects ,",
    "we perform the full rpa calculation using the disentangled band structure .",
    "the fully screened coulomb interaction is compared with that for the original band structure in fig.[fig : w ] where the average of the five diagonal terms in the wannier basis @xmath55 is plotted ,    @xmath56    the two methods yield similar results the static values agree with each other within 0.2 ev , and the frequency dependence is weak at low frequencies . as frequency increases",
    "there is a sharp increase at @xmath5720 ev , where screening by plasmons becomes ineffective .",
    "these results assure that screening effects can be treated accurately with the disentangled band structure .",
    "the hubbard @xmath6 is calculated by the constrained rpa , namely , by replacing @xmath58 in eq.([eq : w ] ) with @xmath39 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : u ] .",
    "there is no large fluctuation against frequency , in contrast to the methods described in sec.[sec : method ] , and @xmath59 shows a stable behavior .",
    "as is expected , @xmath6 is significantly larger than @xmath58 at low frequencies .",
    "this implies proper elimination of @xmath60 screening processes is crucial .",
    "comparing with the previous results using a combined energy and band window @xcite , the agreement is reasonably good .",
    "a small difference between these two results at low frequency may be due to a small portion of @xmath0-@xmath0 screening presumably contained in the previous method @xcite , although it should be excluded from the crpa calculations .",
    "we carried out the calculations for a series of other 3@xmath0 metals as well and found in all the cases that ( i ) the present scheme is numerically stable and does not result in unphysical frequency dependence of @xmath6 , and ( ii ) the value of @xmath61 is close to that from the original band structure .",
    "the latter is confirmed in fig.[fig : static ] where the static values ( @xmath62 limit ) are summarized . concerning @xmath6 , the present method gives larger values compared to the previous results , particularly for early transition metals .",
    "since @xmath58 is nearly equal to each other in the two methods , the discrepancy is ascribed to the different treatment between @xmath2 and @xmath63 .",
    "we should note that @xmath2 in the previous method depends on the choice of the window . for a wider window ,",
    "obviously we would obtain a better agreement .",
    "also , some states have a mixed character of 3@xmath0 and 4@xmath4 near the anti - crossing points .",
    "this makes elimination of the screening process difficult in the original band structure . the present scheme , on the other hand , enables us to determine @xmath6 without ambiguity .",
    "the @xmath0 bands are disentangled from the @xmath1 bands . consequently , the polarization in the @xmath0 space is well - defined and can be removed completely in @xmath64 .    in the present formulation ,",
    "small off - diagonal matrix elements of the kohn - sham hamiltonian between the @xmath0 space wavefunction @xmath65 constructed from the wannier orbitals and the @xmath1 space @xmath66 are ignored .",
    "this is the reason why the anti - crossing is avoided .",
    "if the energy of this hybridization point in the band dispersion is smaller than the screened coulomb energy and the energy scale of the interest , strictly speaking , one has to keep all of these hybridizing bands in the effective model , because the hybridization effects are non - perturbative . in the present case of transition metals , the energy crossing point of 4@xmath4 and 3@xmath0 bands",
    "are relatively larger than the screened coulomb energy scale and the low energy models constructed only from the 3@xmath0 wannier orbitals may give at least qualitatively reasonable description of the low energy physics .",
    "we have proposed a method to calculate the effective interaction parameters for the effective low - energy models of real materials when bands are entangled .",
    "the key point is to first properly orthogonalize the low - energy subspace contained in the models and the complementary high - energy subspace to each other .",
    "this orthogonalization by the projection technique enables the disentanglement of the bands .",
    "once the disentangled band structure is obtained , the constraint rpa method can be used to determine the partially screened coulomb interaction uniquely .",
    "numerical tests for 3@xmath0 metals show that the method is stable and yields reasonable results .",
    "the method is applicable to any system .",
