    "from the statistical study of financial time series have arisen a set of properties or empirical laws sometimes called `` stylized facts '' or seasonalities .",
    "these properties have the characteristic of being common and persistent across different markets , time periods and assets @xcite . as it has been suggested @xcite",
    ", the reason why these `` patterns '' appear could be because markets operate in synchronization with human activities which leave a trace in the financial time series .",
    "however using the `` right clock '' might be of primary importance when dealing with statistical properties and the patterns could vary depending if we use daily data or intra - day data and event time , trade time or arbitrary intervals of time ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 minutes , etc . ) .",
    "for example , it is a well - known fact that empirical distributions of financial returns and log - returns are fat tailed @xcite , however as one increases the time scale the fat - tail property becomes less pronounced and the distribution approach the gaussian form @xcite . as was stated in @xcite , the fact that the shape of the distribution changes with time makes it clear that the random process underlying prices must have a non - trivial temporal structure . in a previous work allez et al .",
    "@xcite established several new stylized facts concerning the intra - day seasonalities of single and cross - sectional stock dynamics .",
    "this dynamics is characterized by the evolution of the moments of its returns during a typical day .",
    "following the same approach , we show the bin size dependence of these patterns for the case of returns and , motivated by the work of kaisoji @xcite , we extend the analysis to relative prices and show how in this case , these patterns are independent of the size of the bin , also independent of the index we consider but characteristic for each index .",
    "these facts could be used in order to detect an anomalous behaviour during the day , like market crashes or intra - day bubbles @xcite .",
    "the present work is completely empirical but it could offer signs of the underlying stochastic process that governs the financial time series .",
    "the data consists in two sets of intra - day high frequency time series , the cac @xmath0 and the s&p @xmath1 . for each of the @xmath5 days of our period of analysis ( march @xmath6 )",
    ", we dispose with the evolution of the prices of each of the stocks that composes our indexes during a specific day from @xmath7 a.m. to @xmath8 p.m. the main reasons why we chose to work with these two indexes are : the number of stocks that compose them ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , the time gap between their respective markets and the different range of stock prices ( between @xmath3 and @xmath11 usd for the s&p @xmath1 and between @xmath3 and @xmath12 eu for the cac @xmath0 ) .",
    "as the changes in prices are not synchronous between different stocks ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) , we manipulated our original data in order to construct a new homogeneous matrix @xmath13 of `` bin prices '' . in order to do this , we divided our daily time interval @xmath14 $ ] in @xmath15 bins of size @xmath16 ( minutes ) , i.e. @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 , ... , b_{k } = [ 16:00 - t,16:00]$ ] , where the right endpoints of these intervals are called `` bin limits '' . for a particular day",
    "@xmath19 , the prices that conform the matrix @xmath13 are given by the last prices that stock @xmath20 reaches just before a specific bin limit .",
    "are the stocks and @xmath21 are bins . the asynchronous prices are show in red and the bin limit in blue . ]",
    "each row in the matrix below represents the evolution of the prices of a particular stock as function of the bins .",
    "for example , the element @xmath22 , represents the price for a particular day @xmath19 of the stock @xmath20 and just before the bin limit of the bin @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath23 in a similar way , we can construct the matrix @xmath24 for each of the @xmath25 stocks .",
    "@xmath26 is the price of the stock @xmath27 in the day @xmath19 and just before the bin limit of the bin @xmath21.@xmath28    in the following and for simplicity , we will refer to the price @xmath29 of a particular stock @xmath30 during a particular day @xmath31 and just before the bin limit of the bin @xmath21 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "we will perform our statistical analysis over the variable @xmath34 that can be computed from the matrices above . for our interests",
    "we will be working with returns    @xmath35    and relative prices @xcite@xmath36    the single or collective stock dynamics is characterized by the evolution of the moments of the returns ( or relative prices ) .",
    "below , we show how we computed these moments @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the stock  @xmath37  in bin @xmath38 is characterized by its four first moments : mean @xmath39 , standard deviation ( volatility ) @xmath40 skewness @xmath41 and kurtosis @xmath42 defined as@xmath43where @xmath44 is the median of all values of @xmath34 and time averages for a given stock in a given bin are expressed with angled brackets @xmath45 .",
    "the cross - sectional distributions ( i.e. the dispersion of the values of the variable @xmath46 of the @xmath47 stocks for a given bin @xmath38 in a given day @xmath48 ) are also characterized by the four first moments@xmath49    \\label{7 } \\\\",

    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : fig2](a ) , the mean tends to be small ( in the order of @xmath59 ) and noisy around zero .",
    "the average volatility reveals the well known u - shaped pattern ( figure  [ fig : fig2](b ) ) , high at the opening of the day , decreases during the day and increases again at the end of the day .",
    "the average skewness ( figure  [ fig : fig2](c ) ) is also noisy around zero .",
    "the average kurtosis exhibits an inverted u - pattern ( figure  [ fig : fig2](d ) ) , it increases from around @xmath60 at the beginning of the day to around @xmath61 at mid day , and decreases again during the rest of the day .     +      as the time average of the cross sectional mean is equal to the stock average of the single stock mean , the result we show in figure  [ fig : fig3](a ) is exactly the same as the one shown in figure  [ fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "the time average of the cross sectional volatility @xmath62 ( figure  [ fig : fig3](b ) ) reveals a u - shaped pattern very similar to the stock average volatility , but less noisy ( less pronounced peaks ) .",
    "the dispersion of stocks is stronger at the beginning of the day and decreases as the day proceeds .",
    "the average skewness @xmath63 is noisy around zero without any particular pattern ( figure  [ fig : fig3](c ) ) .",
    "the cross sectional kurtosis @xmath64 ( figure  [ fig : fig3](d ) ) also exhibits an inverted u - pattern as in the case of the single stock kurtosis .",
    "it increases from around @xmath65 at the beginning of the day to around @xmath66 at mid day , and decreases again during the rest of the day .",
    "this means that at the beginning of the day the cross - sectional distribution of returns is on average closer to gaussian .",
    "+      in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , we compare the stock average of single stock volatility @xmath55 $ ] ( black ) , the time average of the cross - sectional volatility @xmath67 ( red ) and the average absolute value of the equi - weighted index return @xmath68 ( blue ) for the cac  @xmath0 , and for @xmath58 ( left ) and @xmath69 minute bin ( right ) .",
    "similar results were obtained for the s&p @xmath1 . as can be seen",
    ", the average absolute value of the equi - weighted index return also exhibits a u - shaped pattern and it is a proxy for the index volatility .",
    "one thing that results interesting to observe is that the values of these volatilities actually depends of the size of the bin that we consider . for @xmath69 minute bin ,",
    "the volatilities double the values found for @xmath58 minute bin ( we will discuss this result in the next sections ) .      in order to compute the correlation between stocks ,",
    "we first normalize the returns by the dispersion of the corresponding bin @xcite i.e. , @xmath70the @xmath71 correlation matrix for a given bin @xmath38 would be given by@xmath72    in figure  [ fig : fig5](a ) we show the average correlation between stocks ( blue ) and top eigenvalue @xmath73 ( green ) for the cac @xmath0 .",
    "as can be seen the largest eigenvalue is a measure of the average correlation between stocks @xcite .",
    "this average correlation increases during the day from a value around @xmath74 to a value around @xmath75 when the market closes . for the case of smaller eigenvalues",
    ", what we can see is that the amplitude of risk factors decreases during the day ( figure  [ fig : fig5](b ) ) , as more and more risk is carried by the market factor ( figure  [ fig : fig5](a ) ) @xcite .    in order to simplify the computation of the @xmath76 correlation matrices for each bin",
    "@xmath38 in the case of the s&p @xmath1 , we computed the correlation matrix @xmath77 for @xmath61 different sets of stocks : @xmath78 : composed by the @xmath79 first stocks of the s&p @xmath1 ; @xmath80 : composed by @xmath79 stocks randomly picked ; and @xmath81 : composed by @xmath82 stocks randomly picked .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6](a ) shows @xmath83 as function of the bins .",
    "although the values of the eigenvalues seem to be out of scale , it can be seen clearly that the average correlation increases during the day .",
    "this scale conflict is solved by normalizing the value of the top eigenvalue not by @xmath47 but by the sample size @xmath84 ( i.e. @xmath79 or @xmath82 ) ( figure  [ fig : fig6](b ) ) . as can be seen the average correlation of the index",
    "can be computed by taking a subset of it which means that actually just the more capitalized stocks in the index drive the rest of stocks .",
    "in this section we will report the results we found for the s&p @xmath1 .",
    "similar results were found also for the cac @xmath0 .",
    "we will see how in the case of the relative prices these intra - day seasonalities are independent of the size of the bin , also independent of the index we consider ( but characteristic for each index ) however this is not the case for the returns .",
    "each path in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] represents the evolution of a particular moment of one of the stocks that compose the s&p @xmath1 ( i.e. one path , one stock moment ) .",
    "the stock average of the single stock mean @xmath85 $ ] , volatility @xmath86 $ ] , skewness @xmath56 $ ] and kurtosis @xmath57 $ ] of the s&p @xmath1 are shown in black .",
    "the stock average of the single stock mean varies around zero .",
    "the average volatility increases logarithmically with time .",
    "the skewness varies between @xmath87 $ ] with an average value of zero .",
    "the single stock kurtosis takes values between @xmath88 $ ] with an average value of one and its stock average starts from a value around @xmath60 in the very beginning of the day and decreases quickly to the mean value @xmath89 in the first minutes of the day .",
    "+      each path in figure  [ fig : fig8 ] represents the evolution of a particular index moment during a particular day ( i.e. one path , one day moment ) . as in the case of the single stock volatility ,",
    "the cross - sectional dispersion @xmath90 increases logarithmically with respect to the time ( figure  [ fig : fig8](b ) ) .",
    "the cross - sectional skewness @xmath91 takes values in the interval @xmath92 $ ] with an average value of zero ( figure  [ fig : fig8](c ) ) .",
    "the average kurtosis @xmath64 starts from a value around @xmath65 in the very beginning of the day and decreases quickly to the mean value @xmath60 in the first minutes of the day ( figure  [ fig : fig8](d ) ) .",
    "+      similarly as we did in section 3.3 for returns , in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] we show a comparative plot between the stock average of the single stock volatility @xmath55 $ ] , the time average of the cross - sectional volatility @xmath62 and the average absolute value of the cross - sectional mean @xmath68 for the relative prices of the s&p @xmath1 , and for @xmath58 and @xmath69 minute bin .",
    "as can be seen , these three measures exhibit the same kind of intra - day pattern ( as it did in the case of the returns ) .",
    "but the most important fact is to notice that this intra - day seasonality is independent of the size of the bin , also independent of the index we consider , but characteristic for each index ( see inset figure  [ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "as we saw in the last section , the volatilities for the relative prices exhibit the same kind of intra - day pattern ( figure  [ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "this intra - day seasonality is independent of the size of the bin , and the index we consider , but characteristic for each index . actually , this is not true in the case of the returns as we already suggested in section 3.3 from figure  [ fig : fig4 ] . if we consider the odd moments ( mean and skewness ) of the returns , the behaviour is basically the same ( noisy around zero ) and without any particular pattern , independently of the bin size ( as can be seen in figures  [ fig : fig2 ] ,  [ fig : fig3 ] and  [ fig : fig10 ] ) .",
    "but for the case of the even moments of returns , although they exhibit the well known u and inverted u - patterns , these patterns depend on the bin size .",
    "this fact is well illustrated through figures  [ fig : fig11 ] and  [ fig : fig12 ] in where we have chosen @xmath3 different values of bin size from @xmath93 to @xmath94 minutes . in these figures",
    "we show the time average of the cross - sectional volatility and kurtosis for the s&p @xmath1 but a similar bin size dependence can be shown for the cac @xmath0 or any other index and also for the time average of the single stock volatility and kurtosis .     for @xmath3 different values of bin size @xmath16 .",
    "]    by other hand the kurtosis is a decreasing function of the size of the bin and the inverted u - pattern is evident just when we consider `` small '' bin sizes , in our case this occurs for @xmath58 and @xmath93 minute bin ( figure  [ fig : fig12 ] ) .",
    "this represents a confirmation that on small scales the returns have heavier tails , and on long time scales they are more gaussian @xcite .     for @xmath3 different values of bin size @xmath16 . ]",
    "one of the motivations we had in order to explore into the intra - day seasonalities for relative prices was due to kaisoji s previous work @xcite . in his work",
    "he found that the upper tail of the complementary cumulative distribution function of the ensemble of the relative prices in the high value of the price is well described by a power - law distribution which when its exponent approached two , the japan s internet bubble burst .",
    "taking into consideration our recent findings we suggest the use of the bin size independence for intra - day patterns in relative prices in order to characterize `` atypical days '' for indexes and `` anomalous behaviours '' for stocks .",
    "the time average of the cross - sectional moments represents the average behaviour of a particular index moment during an average day . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] we showed how each path represents the evolution of a particular index moment for one of the days of the period under analysis ( i.e. one path , one day moment ) .",
    "if we look directly into the prices of the cac @xmath0 and s&p @xmath1 , we can observe during day @xmath95 a fall of the prices of the stocks that compose both indexes . during the days before and following day @xmath95 , the ( index ) moments move along our intra - day pattern . moreover ,",
    "if we pick randomly one day from our period of analysis , in most of the cases our index during that day will behave as our intra - day seasonality ( as in figure  [ fig : fig13 ] ) , but the one for day @xmath95 will not . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] we show our ( cross - sectional ) intra - day seasonalities for the mean ( a ) and volatility ( b ) in blue and in clear blue the respective cross - sectional stock moments for 3 days randomly picked .",
    "the average behaviour ( of the moments ) of our index during these days moves along with our intra - day pattern .",
    "this is not the case of the curve corresponding to the day @xmath95 shown in red which clearly diverges from the expected behaviour .",
    "this is what could be called as an `` atypical day '' for the s&p @xmath1 .",
    "we could used the same reasoning as before in order to characterize `` anomalous behaviours '' in stocks . as we said in section 4.1 ,",
    "each path in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] represents the average evolution of a particular moment of one of the stocks that compose the s&p @xmath1 .",
    "the stock average of those single stock moments represents the average behaviour of that moment for an average stock during an average day of our period of analysis .",
    "that means that if from our set of stocks we pick randomly one stock , in most of the cases ( its moments ) will behave as our intra - day seasonality .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig14 ] where we show our intra - day seasonalities for the mean ( a ) and volatility ( b ) in blue and the respective single stock moments for 3 stocks randomly picked in clear blue .",
    "as can be seen , the average behaviour of the moments of these stocks move along with our intra - day patterns .",
    "however this is not the case for the curves shown in red which have been chosen on purpose to illustrate how in this case the stock @xmath96 behaves in an anomalous way with respect to what is expected .",
    "in the present report , we have analysed the intra - day seasonalities of the single and cross - sectional ( or collective ) stock dynamics . in order to do this",
    ", we characterized the dynamics of a stock ( or a set of stocks ) by the evolution of the moments of its returns ( and relative prices ) during a typical day .",
    "what we have called `` single stock intra - day seasonalities '' is the average behaviour of the moments of the returns ( and relative prices ) of an average stock in an average day . in the same way ,",
    "the cross - sectional intra - day seasonality is not more than the average day behaviour of an index moment .",
    "we presented these intra - day seasonalities for returns ( figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig3 ] ) and relative prices ( figures  [ fig : fig7 ] and  [ fig : fig8 ] ) and compared the stock average of single stock volatility @xmath55 $ ] , the time average of the cross - sectional volatility @xmath62 and the average absolute value of the equi - weighted index @xmath68 ( figures  [ fig : fig4 ] and  [ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "one thing that results interesting to observe , in the case of the returns , is that these `` patterns '' actually depend on the size of the bin .",
    "this fact was well illustrated with @xmath3 different values of bin size through figure  [ fig : fig11 ] for volatilities and figure  [ fig : fig12 ] for kurtosis in which its inverted u - pattern is evident just when we consider `` small '' bin sizes .    in the case of relative prices , the volatilities also exhibit the same kind of intra - day pattern ( figure  [ fig : fig9 ] ) , but contrary with the returns , it is independent of the size of the bin , and the index we consider , but characteristic for each index .",
    "we suggested in section @xmath97 how this bin size independence of intra - day patterns in relative prices could be used in order to characterize `` atypical days '' for indexes and `` anomalous behaviours '' in stocks .",
    "this was showed in figures  [ fig : fig13 ] and  [ fig : fig14 ] where we presented our intra - day seasonalities for the mean ( a ) and volatility ( b ) in blue and the respective the cross - sectional moments for 3 days ( and the single stock moments for 3 stocks ) randomly picked in clear blue and we saw how the average behaviour of their moments move along with our intra - day patterns which was not the case for the day @xmath95 and the stock @xmath96 .",
