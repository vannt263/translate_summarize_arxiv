    "pervasive , geolocalized data generated by individuals has recently triggered a renewed interest for the study of cities and urban dynamics , and in particular , individual mobility patterns @xcite .",
    "various data sources have been used such as car gps @xcite , rfids for collective transportation @xcite , and also data coming from social networks such as twitter@xcite or foursquare@xcite . a recent , very important source of data",
    "is given by individual mobile phone data @xcite .",
    "these data have allowed to study the individual mobility patterns with a high spatial and temporal resolution @xcite , the automatic detection of urban land uses @xcite , or the detection of communities based on human interactions @xcite .",
    "morphological aspects , such as the quantitative characterization and comparison of cities through their density landscape , their space consumption , their degree of polycentrism , or the clustering degree of their activity centers , have been studied for a long time in quantitative geography and spatial economy @xcite . until the late 2000 ,",
    "these quantitative comparisons of cities were necessarily based on census data and/or remote sensing data , both giving a static estimation of the density of individuals and land uses in the city , at a fine spatial granularity but at a fixed , unique point in time . given the atemporal nature of these studies , they could not investigate some interesting questions related to the dynamical properties of the spatial structure of cities : how much does the city shape change through the course of the day ?",
    "where are the city s hotspots located at different hours of the day ?",
    "how are these hotspots spatially organized ?",
    "is there some kind of typical distance(s ) characterizing the permanent core , or ` backbone ' , of each city ?",
    "mobile phone data contain the spatial information about individuals and how it evolves during the day .",
    "these datasets thus give us the opportunity to answer some of these questions and to characterize quantitatively the spatial structure of cities . in this article",
    ", we address some of these questions using mobile phone data for a set of @xmath0 spanish cities shown on figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "we focus on the spatio - temporal properties of cities and , defining new metrics , study their structural properties and exhibit interesting patterns of urban systems .",
    "our analysis is based on aggregated and annonymized mobile phone traces provided by a spanish telecommunications operator , which concerns 31 spanish urban areas studied during weekdays .",
    "these urban areas are very diverse in terms of geographical location , area , population size and density , as illustrated by figure [ fig : dataset ] .",
    "in particular , the wide range of population sizes will allow us to test some scaling relations and also to identify various behaviors .",
    "we will first describe the dataset and then present the results obtained about several aspects of cities .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown in this study that it is possible to extract relevant information from mobile phone data , not only about the mobility behavior of individuals , but also about the structure of the city itself .",
    "we have defined various indices that allow us to propose a new classification of cities based on their dynamical properties .",
    "we have also presented a method to determine the dominant centers , the hotspots , and we have confirmed recent results -obtained on completely different data- showing that the number of activity centers in cities scales sublinearly with the population size of the city . we have also highlighted some properties of hotspots such as the strong stability of the hierarchy of city centers along the day , whatever the city size .",
    "these results constitute a step towards a quantitative typology of cities and their spatial structure , an important ingredient in the construction of a science of cities .",
    "comparing the spatial structure of cities of very different population sizes and areas requires to rely on a harmonized definition of cities that goes beyond the arbitrariness of the spatial boundaries of the administrative units @xcite . to that extent",
    ", we have chosen to rely on the _ urban areas _ defined by the audes initiative ( areas urbanas de espaa ) which capture some coherent delimitations of cities regarding the home - work commuting patterns of individuals living in the core city of the metropolitan areas and in their surrounding municipalities .",
    "these delimitations are built upon statistical criteria based on the proportion of residents of surrounding municipalities that commute to the main city to work .",
    "we started with the venables index @xcite , defined as :    @xmath1    with @xmath2 the share of individuals present in cell @xmath3 at time @xmath4 , and @xmath5 the distance between @xmath3 and @xmath6 . when all activity is concentrated in one spatial unit",
    "only , the minimum value zero of @xmath7 is reached .",
    "an important point of this dilatation index is that one does nt need to determine hotspots to compute it . by normalizing @xmath7 by the densities",
    ", we can compute a weighted average distance , the ` venables distance '    @xmath8    with @xmath9 the share of individuals present in cell @xmath3 at time @xmath4 . in order to compare the value of @xmath10 across cities ,",
    "we compute @xmath11 with @xmath12 the area of the city . by considering all pairs of cells and weighting their distance by the densities of individuals in each of them , @xmath13 signals how much the important places of the city at time @xmath4 are distant from each other .",
    "the data gives access to the spatial density @xmath14 of users at different moments .",
    "the full density is a complex object and we have to extract relevant and useful information .",
    "the locations that display a density much larger than the others - the hotspots - give a good picture of the city by showing where most of the people are .",
    "the hotspots thus contain important information about points of interest and activities in the city .",
    "the determination of centres and subcentres is a problem which has been broadly tackled in urban economics @xcite .",
    "starting from a spatial distribution of densities , we have to identify the local maxima .",
    "this is in principle a simple problem solved by the choice of a threshold @xmath15 for the density @xmath16 : a cell @xmath3 is a hotspot at time @xmath4 if the instantaneous density of users @xmath17 .",
    "this is for example what was done in @xcite to determine employment centres in los angeles .",
    "it is however clear that this method introduces some arbitrariness due to the choice of @xmath15 , and also requires prior knowledge of the city to which it is applied to choose a relevant value of @xmath15 .",
    "nonparametric methods have also been applied to determine the number of centres , some based on the regression of the natural logarithm of employment density on distance from the centre @xcite , some on the exponent of the negative exponential fit of the density distribution @xcite .",
    "limits of these methods stand in the fact that they return a unique number of centres that could be biased when the actual density distribution is not properly fitted by an exponential law . here",
    "we will propose an alternative method that allows us to control the impact of this choice .",
    "a first simple criterion is to choose the point that corresponds to the average @xmath18 of the distribution at time @xmath4 : all the cells whose density is larger than @xmath19 are hotspots .",
    "this is indeed a weak definition of what can be considered as a hotspot , and we propose here to use it as a ` lower ' bound @xmath20 .    in order to understand how the various properties of hotspots will depend on this definition , we introduce a more restrictive definition which will be considered as an upper bound of what can be considered as a hotspot . in the following",
    "we discuss how to find this upper bound . in order to characterize the disparity of the activity in the city and to isolate the dominant places , we first plot the lorenz curve of the density distribution in the city at each hour .",
    "the lorenz curve , a standard object in economics , is a graphical representation of the cumulative distribution function of an empirical probability distribution . for a given hour",
    ", we have the distribution of densities @xmath14 and we sort them in increasing rank , and denote them by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of cells .",
    "the lorenz curve is constructed by plotting on the x - axis the proportion of cells @xmath23 and on the y - axis the corresponding proportion of users density @xmath24 with : @xmath25 if all the densities were of the same order the lorenz curve would be the diagonal from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . in general we observe a concave curve with a more or less strong curvature , and the area between the diagonal and the actual curve is related to the gini coefficient , an important indicator of inequality used in economics .    in the lorenz curve , the stronger the curvature the stronger the inequality and , intuitively , the smaller the number of hotspots .",
    "this remark allows us to construct a new criterion by relating the number of dominant hotspots ( i.e. those that have a very high value compared to the other cells ) to the slope of the lorenz curve at point @xmath28 : the larger the slope , the smaller the number of dominant individuals in the statistical distribution .",
    "the natural way to identify the typical scale of the number of hotspots is to take the intersection point @xmath29 between the tangent of @xmath30 at point @xmath28 and the horizontal axis @xmath31 ( see figure [ fig : lorenz - curve ] ) .",
    "this method is inspired from the classical scale determination for an exponential decay : if the decay from @xmath28 were an exponential of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the typical scale we want to extract , this method would give @xmath34 .",
    "we note here that the average criterion corresponds to the point of the lorenz curve with slope equal to @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , the general expression of the lorenz curve for the set of densities @xmath14 whose cumulative function is @xmath36 is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inverse function of the cumulative .",
    "this point thus satisfies @xmath39 which gives @xmath40 or in other words , the hotspots will be those with densities larger than the average .",
    "in contrast , our more restrictive criterion based on the slope at @xmath28 gives @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the maximum value of @xmath14 ( for a given time @xmath4 ) .",
    "we thus see that in general @xmath43 and that this new criterion , more restrictive , does not only depend on the average value of the density but also on the dispersion : as @xmath42 increases , the value of @xmath29 increases and therefore the number of detected hotspots decreases .",
    "all other possible and reasonable methods will then give a value comprised in the interval @xmath44 $ ] between the average criterion and our criterion ( also denoted by ` loubar ' ) . instead of choosing a particular point , we will thus study most of the properties computed for hotspots with the two methods , giving us both a lower and upper bounds .",
    "in particular , we will be able to test the robustness of our results against the arbitrariness of the hotspot identification method .",
    "figure  [ fig : mapshs - methods - bcn ] shows the location of the hotspots selected according to the two methods / criteria at different moments of the day , in the metropolitan area of barcelona .",
    "these maps can be regarded as the extremes of hotspots maps that reasonable delimitation methods could produce ( i.e. with a number of hotspots comprised between @xmath45 and @xmath29 .",
    "square cells . ]        in the hotspots identification process , the size of the grid cells on which we aggregate the numbers / densities of users is another arbitrary parameter ( cf .",
    "section methods ) . since we do nt want to determine this value separately for each city , we consider that several sizes should be tested for each city and that it is reasonable to consider that this cell size @xmath33 can vary from @xmath46 meters to @xmath47 km .",
    "figure [ fig : hovernvsa - cities ] gives an idea of how much the proportion of hotspots change from one cell size to another .",
    "the cell size @xmath33 should primarily be chosen based on what is considered as a reasonable size for an urban hotspot . from the pedestrian point of view , every size between 500 metres and 2 kilometres seems _ a priori _ acceptable . below 500 m",
    ", it would clearly be necessary to aggregate contiguous hotspots : for example , for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 cells ) , two contiguous hotspots could not as easily be distinguished as two different ones from a pedestrian point of view .",
    "in contrast , a size of @xmath50 can be considered as an upper bound for the same reasons : if two contiguous cells are classified as hotspots , it is reasonable to identify them as two distincts neighbourhoods .",
    "it is however a question of perception and should be discussed carefully . in the hypothesis of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 cells ) , we chose to consider that _ two adjacent hotspots are two different hotspots_. for reasonable sizes of grid , the values of the indicators should be robust with a change of the cell size .",
    "we then tested the sensitivity of our results with respect to different resolutions .     for two hotspots definitions and different sizes of grid cells , for eight different cities of very different sizes*.",
    "the cities chosen cover the full range of the poulation size distribtion of the set of the 31 cities studied .",
    "every reasonable method for defining hotspots would give a value between the two lines of each plot .",
    "one can see that qualitatively pattern stays identical whatever the grid size for couple ( city , method ) . ]      in figure  [ fig : hvsp2 ] we show the scaling relation between the number of hotspots with the population and the effect of the grid size . here",
    "we see that the scaling results and the value of the exponent are robust against a change in ( i ) the threshold used for identifying the hotspots and ( ii ) the size of the grid cells .     vs. the population size @xmath53 for the 31 cities studied .",
    "* each point in the scatterplot corresponds to the average number of hotspots determined for each one - hour time bin of a weekday time period considered for the five weekdays .",
    "the linear relationship on a log - log plot indicates a power - law relationship between the two quantities , with an exponent value @xmath54 , indicating that the number of activity centers in a city grows sublinearly with its population size . ]",
    "the kendall rank coefficient is used as a test statistic to establish whether two lists of random variables may be regarded as statistically dependent .",
    "to each cell @xmath3 we associate its rank @xmath56 in the ordered density distribution at time @xmath4 . kendall s",
    "@xmath55 value indicates how much the hierarchy changed between @xmath57 and @xmath4 .",
    "for a set of pairs @xmath58 , it is equal to the difference between the number of converging pairs ( i.e. @xmath59 was larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) than @xmath60 at @xmath61 and is still larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) at @xmath4 ) and the number of diverging pairs ( @xmath59 was smaller ( resp .",
    "larger ) than @xmath60 at @xmath61 and is larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) at @xmath4 ) .",
    "the kendall values @xmath62 are plotted on figure  [ fig : kendall ] .    under the null hypothesis of independence of two lists",
    ", the distribution of @xmath55 has an expected value of zero and for larger samples , the variance is given by @xmath63 any value of @xmath55 larger than this null - value signals the existence of relevant correlations .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : kendall ] the evolution of kendall @xmath55 values calculated for the set of permament hotspots during daytime in an average weekday , for 31 spanish urban areas with more than 200,000 inhabitants .",
    "the curves are ranged by decreasing order of population size ( the biggest city in the top left corner , the smallest in the bottom right ) .",
    "the red curves correspond to the daytime evolution of the kendall @xmath55 for the hotspots selected with the ` loubar ' more restrictive criterion , the blue ones to the kendall @xmath55 of the hotspots selected with the average criterion .",
    "these results indicate that the hierarchy of permanent hotspots is indeed very stable in time .",
