    "] , objects that emit more energy in the far - infrared / submillimeter than at all other wavelengths combined .",
    "redshift surveys of complete samples of _ iras _ galaxies now agree that infrared selected galaxies become the dominant population of extragalactic objects at bolometric luminosities above @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .",
    "reasonable assumptions about the lifetime of the infrared phase suggest that a _ substantial fraction of all galaxies with _ @xmath16 _ may at some point in their lifetime pass through such a stage of intense infrared emission ( soifer et al 1987)_. this review focuses on providing an up - to - date summary of the observed morphological properties of uligs , those infrared - selected objects which represent an extreme phase of nuclear activity in galaxies , equivalent to the bolometric luminosity of optically selected qsos .",
    "ground - based optical and near - infrared imaging of complete samples of the brightest infrared galaxies clearly show that a substantial fraction of ligs are strongly interacting or merging spirals , and that the higher the luminosity the more advanced is the merger .",
    "millimeterwave observations of have shown these spirals to be rich in molecular gas ",
    "@xmath17@xmath8 ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1991 )  and that there is an increasing central concentration of this gas with increasing infrared luminosity .",
    "the representative subsample of ligs shown in figure 1 illustrates the signs of strong interactions / mergers ( tidal tails , double nuclei , etc . ) that are revealed in deep optical images of nearby ligs .",
    "comparison of the images with numerical simulations ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ) allows these objects to be placed in a rough time sequence .",
    ".properties of uligs [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     nearly all uligs appear to be late - stage mergers ( e.g. sanders et al 1988a , b ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ; kim 1995 ; murphy et al .",

    "complete _ sample of the nearest and best - studied uligs .",
    "the true extent of faint tidal features plus greater detail in the inner disks of these uligs is better revealed in the higher resolution ground - based images and _ hst _ images of uligs shown in color plates  7 - 8 ( pp .",

    "table  1 summarizes properties of the complete sample of 20 uligs from the _ iras _ bright galaxy samples ( soifer et al 1987 ; sanders et al 1995 ) .",
    "the mean lifetime for the ulig phase , estimated from the observed mean separation and relative velocity of the merger nuclei , is @xmath4@xmath18yrs .",
    "the enormous central gas supplies present in uligs are clearly an ideal breeding ground for both powerful circumnuclear starbursts and agn . indeed those uligs that have been imaged with adaptive optics from the ground ( see fig .",
    "3 ) or with _ hst _ ( see fig .",
    "4 ) show evidence for a population of massive young ( @xmath410@xmath19yrs ) star clusters , although these clusters account for typically much less that half the ulig bolometric luminosity ( surace & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "most of the luminosity appears to be concentrated in one or two small ( @xmath20100pc ) regions centered on the putative nucleus ( or nuclei ) ( e.g. soifer , et al .",
    "1998 ) , and it is these compact regions which most likely harbor exotic superstarbursts , and/or a powerful agn",
    ".    there is now substantial evidence that uligs are elliptical galaxies forming by merger - induced dissipative collapse ( kormendy & sanders 1992 ) , including @xmath21-law brightness profiles ( e.g. schweizer 1982 ; wright et al . 1990 ; kim 1995 ) , newly - formed globular clusters ( e.g. fig . 4 and surace et al . 1998 ) , central gas densities ( @xmath22 at @xmath23kpc : scoville et al . 1991 ) that are as high as stellar mass densities in the cores of giant ellipticals , and powerful  superwinds \" ( heckman et al . 1987 ; armus et al .",
    "1989 ) which will likely leave behind a largely dust free core .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume also , that this scenario might lead to a constant ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass in agreement with recent observational results ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "future infrared space missions and more sensitive submillimeter surveys should succeed in identifying more distant uligs , thus allowing a direct test of whether the infrared luminosity function evolves as steeply as that of qsos , and whether uligs were more numerous at @xmath24 when it is presumed that most of the ellipticals were formed from mergers of spirals ."
