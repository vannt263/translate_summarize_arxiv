    "over the past decade , the unique mechanical , electrical , and optical properties of carbon nanotubes , including the potential for useful technological applications , have created a lot of excitement @xcite .",
    "while many of these properties are well understood by now , the experimental observation of intrinsic @xcite and anomalously strong proximity - induced @xcite superconductivity continues to pose open questions to theoretical understanding . in this paper",
    "we present a theory of one - dimensional ( 1d ) superconductivity as found in ropes of carbon nanotubes @xcite and potentially in other nanowires .",
    "ropes are 1d materials in the sense that there is only a relatively small number of propagating channels ( typically , @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) available to electronic transport .",
    "while most other 1d materials tend to become insulating at low temperatures due to the peierls transition or as a consequence of electron - electron interactions , nanotubes can stay metallic down to very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "if the repulsive electron - electron interactions can be overcome by attractive phonon - mediated interactions , ropes of nanotubes can then exhibit a superconducting transition .",
    "however , due to strong 1d fluctuations , this transition is presumably rather broad , and the question of how precisely superconductivity breaks down as the number of propagating channels decreases has to be answered by theory .",
    "experimentally , the breakdown of superconductivity manifests itself as a temperature - dependent resistance below the transition temperature @xmath0 , which becomes more and more pronounced as the rope gets thinner @xcite . according to our theory ,",
    "this resistance is caused by quantum phase slips , and therefore the experimental data published in ref .",
    "@xcite have in fact explored a regime of 1d superconductivity with clear evidence for quantum phase slip events that had not been reached before . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "nanotube ropes represent wires with the smallest number of propagating channels showing intrinsic superconductivity , even when compared to the amorphous moge wires of diameter @xmath3  nm studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where still several thousand channels are available .",
    "we theoretically analyze superconductivity in nanotube ropes by starting from the microscopic model of an array of @xmath4 individual metallic single - wall nanotubes ( swnts ) without disorder , with effectively attractive on - tube interactions and inter - tube josephson couplings .",
    "a similar model has been suggested by gonzlez @xcite . in the absence of the josephson couplings ,",
    "each swnt would then correspond to a _ luttinger liquid _ with interaction parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 marks the noninteracting limit . for simplicity , we take the same @xmath7 on each swnt . for example , for @xmath8 armchair swnts , assuming good screening of the repulsive coulomb interactions , phonon exchange via a breathing mode ( as well as optical phonon modes ) leads to @xmath9 , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of attractive interactions , the dominant coupling mechanism between different swnts",
    "is then given by cooper pair hopping , while single - particle hopping is drastically suppressed by momentum conservation arguments @xcite .",
    "the coupling among different swnts is thus encoded in a _ josephson coupling matrix _",
    "@xmath10 , where @xmath11 . as different nanotube chiralities",
    "are randomly distributed in a rope , only @xmath12 of the swnts can be expected to be metallic . in general , the @xmath10 matrix should therefore be drawn from an appropriate random distribution .",
    "we consider below one individual rope with a fixed ( but unspecified ) matrix , and derive general statements valid for arbitrary @xmath10 . in that sense",
    ", our theory allows to capture some disorder effects , at least qualitatively .",
    "however , since typical elastic mean free paths in swnts exceed @xmath13 m @xcite , disorder effects within individual swnts are ignored completely .",
    "the above reasoning leads us to the problem of @xmath4 coupled strongly correlated luttinger liquids , where the number of `` active '' chains @xmath14 with reference to the experiments of ref .",
    "this is a difficult problem that neither permits the use of classical ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory nor of the standard bcs approach , in contrast to the situation encountered in , e.g. , wide quasi-1d organic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the approach taken in this paper is sketched next . after a careful derivation of the coupled - chain action in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we proceed by introducing the appropriate order parameter field . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we then perform a cumulant expansion in this order parameter , and thereby give a microscopic derivation of the quantum gl action , which then allows to make further progress .",
    "we establish the temperature regime where this theory is reliable , and then focus on the important phase fluctuations of the order parameter field . at temperatures @xmath15 well below a mean - field transition temperature @xmath16 , amplitude fluctuations are shown to be massive , and hence the amplitude can safely be treated in mean - field theory .",
    "the massless phase fluctuations then capture the important physics , and we specify the resulting effective low - energy action , valid at temperatures well below @xmath16 . based on this action , sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] explains why quantum phase slips ( qpss ) @xcite are crucial for an understanding of the experimental results of refs .",
    "first , they cause a depression of the transition temperature @xmath0 below the mean - field critical temperature @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath17 , a finite resistance @xmath18 due to qpss appears , which exhibits approximate power - law scaling .",
    "we determine the full temperature dependence of @xmath19 for arbitrary rope length in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , we then compare these results for @xmath18 to the experimental data of ref .",

    "[ sec7 ] offers some concluding remarks . throughout the paper",
    ", we put @xmath20 .",
    "we consider a rope consisting of @xmath4 metallic swnts participating in superconductivity .",
    "experimentally , this number can be found from the residual resistance measured as offset in the resistance when extrapolating down to @xmath21 @xcite . due to the attached normal electrodes in any two - terminal measurement of the rope , despite of the presence of superconductivity",
    ", there will always be a finite contact resistance @xmath22 . since each metallic tube contributes two conduction channels , assuming good transparency for the contacts between metallic tubes and the electrodes , this is given by @xmath23 extrapolation of experimental data for the resistance @xmath18 down to @xmath24 within the superconducting regime then allows to measure @xmath22 , and hence @xmath4 .",
    "good transparency of the contacts is warranted by the sputtering technique used to fabricate and contact the suspended rope samples in the experiments of refs .",
    "an alternative way to estimate @xmath4 comes from atomic force microscopy , which allows to measure the apparent radius of the rope , and hence yields an estimate for the total number of tubes in the rope . on average",
    ", 1/3 of the tubes are metallic @xcite , and one should obtain the same number @xmath4 from this approach . fortunately , these two ways of estimating @xmath4 provide consistent results in most samples @xcite . therefore the values for @xmath4 used below are expected to be reliable .    here",
    "we always assume that phonon exchange leads to attractive interactions overcoming the ( screened ) coulomb interactions .",
    "this assumption can be problematic in ultrathin ropes , where practically no screening arises unless there are close - by gate electrodes .",
    "for sufficiently large rope radius , however , theoretical arguments supporting this scenario have been provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the absence of intra - tube disorder ,",
    "then the appropriate low - energy theory for an individual swnt is the luttinger liquid ( ll ) model @xcite .",
    "the ll theory of swnts is usually formulated within the abelian bosonization approach @xcite . with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the spatial 1d coordinate along the tube , and",
    "@xmath27 is imaginary time , and corresponding integration measure @xmath28 , the action for a single swnt is @xcite @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\int d { \\bf x } \\sum_{a } \\frac{v_a g_a}{2 } \\left [ ( \\partial_\\tau \\theta_{a}/v_{a})^2   +    ( \\partial_x \\theta_{a})^2 \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we take to be the same for every swnt . due to the electron spin and the additional k point degeneracy present in nanotubes @xcite , there are four channels , @xmath30 , corresponding to the total / relative charge / spin modes @xcite , with associated boson fields @xmath31 and dual fields @xmath32 @xcite . in the @xmath33 channels , the second ( dual ) formulation turns out to be more convenient , while the first line of eq .",
    "( [ bosac ] ) is more useful for @xmath34 .",
    "the combined effect of coulomb and phonon - mediated electron - electron interactions results in the interaction parameter @xmath7 , where we assume @xmath5 , reflecting effectively attractive interactions @xcite . in the neutral channels , there are only very weak residual interactions , and we therefore put @xmath35 . finally , the velocities @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ bosac ] ) are defined as @xmath37 , where @xmath38  m@xmath39sec is the fermi velocity .",
    "next we address the question which processes trigger the strongest superconducting fluctuations in a nanotube rope .",
    "this question has been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the conclusion of these studies is that cooper pairs predominantly form on individual swnts rather than involving electrons on different swnts , see , e.g. , the last section in ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion . furthermore ,",
    "the dominant intra - tube fluctuations involve _ singlet _  ( rather than triplet ) cooper pairs .",
    "the relevant order parameter for superconductivity is then given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the electron field operator for a right- or left - moving electron ( @xmath42 ) with spin @xmath43 and k point degeneracy index @xmath44 .",
    "in bosonized language , this operator can be expressed as @xcite @xmath45 \\cos[\\sqrt{\\pi } \\varphi_{c- } ] \\\\ \\nonumber & \\times &   \\cos[\\sqrt{\\pi } \\varphi_{s+ } ] \\cos[\\sqrt{\\pi } \\theta_{s- } ] -   ( \\cos\\leftrightarrow \\sin),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we identify the uv cutoff necessary in the bosonization scheme with the graphite lattice constant , @xmath46  nm . in what follows ,",
    "we use the shorthand notation @xmath47 to label all four boson fields @xmath48 ( or their dual fields ) corresponding to the @xmath49th swnt , where @xmath50 .",
    "the next step is to look at possible couplings among the individual swnts . in principle , three different processes should be taken into account , namely ( i ) direct coulomb interactions , ( ii ) josephson couplings , and ( iii ) single - electron hopping . the last process is strongly suppressed due to the generally different chirality of adjacent tubes @xcite , and , in addition , for @xmath5 , inter - swnt coulomb interactions are irrelevant @xcite . furthermore , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , phonon - exchange mediated interactions between _ different _  swnts can always be neglected against the intra - tube interactions .",
    "therefore the most relevant mechanism is josephson coupling between metallic swnts .",
    "these couplings define a josephson matrix @xmath51 , which contains the amplitudes for cooper pair hopping from the @xmath49th to the @xmath52th swnt .",

    "based on the resulting low - energy action for the phase fluctuations , we have shown that quantum phase slips produce a depression of the critical temperature .",
    "more importantly , the temperature dependence of the linear resistance experimentally observed below the transition temperature can be accounted for by considering the underlying ll physics and the effect of quantum phase slips . despite some admittedly crude approximations , like the neglect of intra - tube disorder and dissipation effects inside the vortex core",
    ", the comparison of experimental curves and theoretical predictions , in particular in the low - temperature region , strongly suggests that the resistive process is indeed dominated by quantum phase slips .",
