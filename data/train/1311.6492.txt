    "recent works have hence explored the performance of _ multiterminal _ , as opposed to standard point - to - point , backhaul compression techniques for the uplink @xcite-@xcite and the downlink @xcite of c - ran systems . in this paper , we first review these works in sec . [",

    "<S> in cloud radio access networks ( c - rans ) , the baseband processing of the available macro- or pico / femto - base stations ( bss ) is migrated to control units , each of which manages a subset of bs antennas . </S>",
    "<S> the centralized information processing at the control units enables effective interference management . </S>",
    "<S> the main roadblock to the implementation of c - rans hinges on the effective integration of the radio units , i.e. , the bss , with the backhaul network . </S>",
    "<S> this work first reviews in a unified way recent results on the application of advanced multiterminal , as opposed to standard point - to - point , backhaul compression techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the gains provided by multiterminal backhaul compression are then confirmed via extensive simulations based on standard cellular models . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , it is observed that multiterminal compression strategies provide performance gains of more than 60% for both the uplink and the downlink in terms of the cell - edge throughput .    </S>",
