    "even if a full description of quantum gravity is not yet available , there are some general features that seem to go hand in hand with all promising candidates for such a theory .",
    "one of them is the need for a higher dimensional space - time , one other the existence of a minimal length scale .",
    "the scale at which the running couplings unify and quantum gravity is likely to occur is called the planck scale . at this scale",
    "the quantum effects of gravitation get as important as those of the electroweak and strong interactions .    in this paper we will implement both of these extensions in the standard model without the aim to derive them from a fully consistent theory . instead , we will to analyse some of the main features that may arise by the assumptions of extra dimensions and a minimal length scale .    in perturbative string theory @xcite ,",
    "the feature of a fundamental minimal length scale arises from the fact that strings can not probe distances smaller than the string scale .",
    "if the energy of a string reaches the planck mass @xmath4 , excitations of the string can occur and cause a non - zero extension @xcite . due to this , uncertainty in position measurement can never become smaller than @xmath5 . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "naturally , this minimum length uncertainty is related to a modification of the standard commutation relations between position and momentum @xcite .",
    "application of this is of high interest for quantum fluctuations in the early universe and for inflation @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of the modified commutation relations into quantum theory is not fully consistent in all approaches , therefore we will define physical variables step by step .",
    "the existence of a minimal length scale becomes important even for collider physics with the further incorporation of the central idea of large extra dimensions ( lxds ) .",
    "the model of lxds , which was recently proposed in @xcite , might allow to study interactions at planckian energies in the next generation collider experiments . here",
    ", the hierarchy - problem is solved or at least reformulated in a geometric language by the existence of @xmath6 compactified lxds in which only the gravitons can propagate .",
    "the standard model particles are bound to our 4-dimensional sub - manifold , often called our 3-brane .",
    "this results in a lowering of the planck scale to a new fundamental scale , @xmath7 , and gives rise to the exciting possibility of tev scale guts @xcite .",
    "the strength of a force at a distance @xmath8 generated by a charge depends on the number of space - like dimensions . for distances smaller than the compactification radius @xmath9",
    ", the gravitational interaction drops faster compared to the other interactions . for distances",
    "much bigger than @xmath9 , gravity is described by the well known potential law @xmath10 . however , for @xmath11 the force lines are diluted into the extra dimensions . assuming a smooth transition to newton s law , this results in a smaller effective coupling constant for gravity .",
    "this leads to the following relation between the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath4 and the higher dimensional planck mass @xmath7 , which is the new fundamental scale of the theory : @xmath12    the lowered fundamental scale would lead to a vast number of observable phenomena for quantum gravity at energies in the range @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the non - observation of these predicted features gives first constraints on the parameters of the model , the number of extra dimensions @xmath6 and the fundamental scale @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , this scenario has major consequences for cosmology and astrophysics such as the modification of inflation in the early universe and enhanced supernova - cooling due to graviton emission @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", additional processes are expected in high - energy collisions @xcite : production of real and virtual gravitons @xcite and the creation of black holes at energies that can be achieved at colliders in the near future @xcite and in ultra high energetic cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we will begin with a sketch of the basics of quantum mechanics ( section ii ) , and in the third section modify these familiar relations by introducing generalised uncertainty .",
    "this will be done in @xmath13 dimensions first , then we care for the full @xmath14 dimensional description ( this is understood to be the analysis on our brane ) . to examine the phenomenological implications on a basic level , we first analyse the modified schrdinger equation , the dirac equation and the klein - gordon equation in sections iv - vi . in section vii",
    "we investigate the influence of the minimal length scale on qed cross - sections at tree - level and compare with @xmath15 data .",
    "section viii provides an estimation of the effect on graviton production .",

    "in standard quantum mechanics translations in space and time are generated by momentum @xmath24 and energy @xmath22 , respectively . however , from purely dimensional reasons , the generators of the translations in space and time are the wave vector @xmath25 and the frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is usually given , of course , by the constant @xmath29 ( often chosen to be equal one ) :    @xmath30    in the present context it is of utmost importance to re - investigate this relation carefully .",

    "one gets : + case ( a ) : @xmath89 case ( b ) : @xmath90    the operator of time translation is no longer identical to the energy operator times @xmath29 in this context . in ordinary quantum mechanics , both of them are @xmath91 . to avoid confusion ,",
    "let @xmath92 be that operator defined by the generator of the lorentz - algebra which belongs to the time translation and @xmath93 the energy - operator for the free particle .",
    "@xmath94 is then the operator of the total energy , including a time - independent potential @xmath95 .",

    "as @xmath99 expresses the relativistic energy - momentum relation we meet a serious problem at this point .",
    "the mass - shell relation is a consequence of @xmath100 being a lorentz vector rather than @xmath101 .",
    "thus , we have to reconsider lorentz covariance in the trans planckian regime .",
    "for energy scales below @xmath7 , an observer boosted to high velocities would observe arbitrarily large energies .",
    "we have to assure then , that the lorentz - transformed @xmath101 always stays below the new limit , which means its transformation properties are not identical to those of the momentum @xmath100 . to put this in other words , a lorentz boosted observer is not allowed to see the minimal length further contracted .",
    "several proposals have been made to solve this problem .",
    "most of them suggest a modification of the lorentz transformation @xcite , but the treatment is still under debate",
    ".    however , the appearance of this problem might not be as astonishing as it seems at first sight . because the modifications we examine do occur at energies at which quantum gravity will get important , curvature corrections to the space time must not be neglected anymore .",
    "therefore , the quantities should be general relativistic covariant rather than flat space lorentz covariant .",
    "these effects will then exhibit themselves in strong background fields , but here also the particle s curvature itself makes an essential contribution .",
    "the exact  but unknown  transformation should assure that no coordinate transformation can push @xmath102 beyond the planck scale . for practical use of the modified quantum theory considered here ,",
    "we treat the momentum @xmath100 as the lorentz covariant partner of the wave vector @xmath101 .",
    "we will assume that the momentum is lorentz covariant and that the functional relation between the two quantities , although unknown , is of the desired behaviour .",
    "inserting one of the approximations at the end of the computation then breaks lorentz covariance .",
    "in fact , in the present scenario @xmath101 is also not a conserved quantity in interactions , because the relation between @xmath100 and @xmath102 is not linear anymore . in single particle dynamics",

    "equation ( [ freesch ] ) will modify the frequency spectrum of very heavy ( @xmath127 ) non relativistic particles and has therefore little applications .",
    "fortunately , we are mainly interested in general in the energy spectrum and do not need to calculate @xmath92 at all .",

    "our perturbative calculations have shown numerically , that first order perturbation theory reaches 5 percent of the exact eigenvalues of the harmonic oscillator in the gup regime .",

    "is modified this yields a jacobian determinant for every final particle . for our example this reads @xmath227 and the differential cross - section for two particles in the final state is then @xmath228 here @xmath229 is the flux . in the laboratory system",
    ", we have @xmath230 , therefore @xmath231 .",
    "this leads to the following expression in the laboratory system : @xmath232 explicitly , in case ( a ) and in the laboratory system , we have @xmath233 and the jacobi determinant of the inverse function in eq .",
    "( [ crosstwopart ] ) is just given by the inverse of this expression .",

    "all this put together yields @xmath238 \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this example illustrates how modified cross sections @xmath239 in scattering processes with two initial and two final states can be obtained from the unmodified cross sections @xmath240 .",
    "this relation is given by the following formula : @xmath241 from the steps of calculation it can be seen that this result holds in higher order perturbation theory , too .",
    "the modification enters through the energies of the in- and outgoing particles and their momenta spaces , only .",
    "however , when incorporating higher orders one has to bear in mind , that we approximated the interaction hamiltonian by neglecting terms of order @xmath242 .",
    "these terms should reappear at higher energies leading to the necessity of a reordering of the corresponding perturbation series . to be precise",
    ", the full modified sm result contains more terms than one would have taken into account by just using eq .",
    "( [ dsds ] ) .",
    "let us interpret this result physically before going any further .",
    "there are two factors occurring .",
    "the first shows that the physics at a certain energy @xmath23 of two particles is now rescaled .",
    "it is identical to the physics that happened before at a smaller energy @xmath22 with @xmath243 .",
    "a higher energy is needed within our model to reach the same distance between the particles as in the standard model : to get the same resolution as with the standard uncertainty principle , one has to go to higher energies !",
    "because the cross sections decrease with energy this means our modified cross section predictions are higher at the same energy than those of the standard model .",
    "the functional behaviour of the standard model result should be cut at @xmath7 and the range up to @xmath7 be stretched out to infinity . in particular , only from this factor the cross - section would asymptotically get constant at a value equal to the unmodified standard model result at @xmath7 .",
    "but there is another factor from the jacobian , which takes into account that the phase space for the final states is reduced significantly from planckian energies on .",
    "since @xmath244 approaches a constant value , its jacobian and therefore the relation ( @xmath245 ) drops to zero . putting both effects together",
    ", the cross section of our model drops below the unmodified standard model result : as can be seen from the jacobian in case ( b ) , the cross section drops exponentially with the reaction energy .",
    "the prediction of a dropping cross section in comparison to the unmodified standard model results is quite remarkable . in most models with the assumption of extra dimensions only , an increase of the cross section is predicted .",
    "this is due to the enhanced possible reactions when taking into account virtual gravitons ( see next section ) .",
    "it is obvious by construction that in our model no physics can be tested below the distance @xmath43 . if the new scale is as low as @xmath246 tev , as suggested by the proposal of large extra dimensions , then an even further increase of the energy that can be delivered by even larger colliders than the next generation can deliver ( @xmath246 14 tev at lhc ) would not yield more insight than the statement that there is such a smallest scale in nature .",
    "as was formulated by giddings this would be `` the end of short distance physics '' @xcite .",
    "however , this was mentioned in a different context . in our approach",
    "the production of tiny black holes is not yet possible at center of mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "energies @xmath247 , because the distance needed for two partons of energy @xmath248 to collapse and form a black hole is just @xmath43 , but the particles can not get that close any longer .",
    "( this might happen then at higher energies , see @xcite . )",
    "therefore , we are most interested in testing the present model in ultra high energetic cosmic ray experiments , like the extended air - shower measurements at kascade - grande and at the pierre auger observatory @xcite , which allows a hundredfold c.o.m .- energy increase over the lhc energies .    for energy @xmath249 ( @xmath250 ) , eq .",
    "( [ dsds ] ) yields the simple expression with the functions inserted in the c.o.m . system    @xmath251    we have used this functional behaviour to get the connection to the measured data of the lep2 collaboration , @xcite , @xmath252 and @xmath253 cross - sections .",
    "the derived factor is independent of the scattering angle .",
    "hence , it holds for the total cross - section , as shown in fig [ fig4 ] . in this context , note that possible limits on physics beyond the standard model in lep2 fermion pair production data have already been discussed in @xcite from the experimental view ",
    "this is one of the new trends in high - energy physics .",
    "many prominently discussed collider signatures of lxds are connected to the virtual and real graviton @xmath254 production processes .",
    "extensive studies of this subject already exist in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in these scenarios kaluza - klein excitations",
    "are given in steps @xmath255 .",
    "the maximum possible frequency @xmath256 is in these scenarios the natural cutoff .",
    "( for simplicity we have set the compactification radii of all extra dimensions to be equal . )",
    "we start with the real gravitons , which are important at energies @xmath257 due to the significant increase of the corresponding phase space factor . in order to estimate the @xmath258 cross section in the context of the modified uncertainty principle , we start with the relation : @xmath259 we have to calculate the number of possible final states with @xmath260 in the c.o.m . system , which is called @xmath261 .",
    "@xmath261 can be obtained using ( with @xmath262 ) : @xmath263 where @xmath120 is the apparent mass of the excitation of the respective kaluza-.klein state : @xmath264    using eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) and the above expressions one obtains for the number of final states : @xmath265 with @xmath266 being the surface of the @xmath6-dimensional unit - sphere and @xmath267 being its volume : @xmath268 these considerations yield the following estimation of the real graviton production cross section : @xmath269 the exact result for the fermion to real graviton plus @xmath53 cross section in the framework of the generalised uncertainty principle depends on the amplitude of the process and on the spin - sums .",
    "however , for the following general considerations the estimate ( [ crossest ] ) is sufficient .",
    "this cross - section would be of the same importance with sm processes if @xmath26 equals @xmath7 , which is here only possible asymptotically .",
    "therefore , real gravitons are produced at a lower rate when a generalised uncertainty principle is employed than expected from lxd scenarios without the generalised uncertainty relation . as a consequence , constraints ( e.g. by energy loss ) from real graviton emission",
    "should be reanalysed carefully in the context of the minimal length proposal .",
    "now , let us turn to the virtual graviton production .",
    "the free graviton propagator from @xcite for @xmath270 ( graviton of apparent mass @xmath120 ) is generalised to : @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the graviton polarisation tensor ( the exact form of the polarisation tensor can be found in @xcite ) . to calculate the complete graviton exchange amplitudes , the amplitudes for different @xmath120 have to be summed up .",
    "the ultraviolet - divergence of this sum has to be fixed by introducing a cut - off parameter @xmath273 that is of order @xmath7 .",
    "such an ad hoc introduction of a cut - off parameter is from a theoretical point of view always somewhat dissatisfying . in the context of the generalised uncertainty relation such a cut - off parameter",
    "is naturally included from first principals via the minimal length scale @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , no ad hoc cut - off parameter is needed : @xmath274 using case ( b ) , it is easy to see that the uv - end converges for all @xmath6 due to the exponential suppression of the momentum measure . to calculate this integral , it can be expanded in a power series in @xmath275 , as given in @xcite using the cut - off parameter . in our approach",
    "the expansion coefficients could be calculated right away .",
    "we will not perform this analysis here .",
    "this result will not yield a more profound relation between the exact parameters and the expansion coefficients , since in our approach the arbitrariness lies in the exact form of the function @xmath276 applied , or its expansion coefficients , respectively .    even if the details of graviton production are not further examined in this paper",
    ", one can now conclude that within our model the cross - sections ( e.g. the above calculated @xmath277 ) are modified in a different way than in the scenario with lxds only .",
    "the virtual graviton exchange increases the cross - section , but the squeezing of the momentum space decreases it .",
    "so we have two effects of a similar magnitude which are working against each other .",
    "therefore , measurable deviations may occur only at energies higher than @xmath7 .",
    "if one is looking for signatures beyond the standard model , one should focus instead on observables that are not too sensitive to the generalised uncertainty , such as modifications in the spin distribution due to the exchange of a spin 2- particle or the appearance of processes that are forbidden by the standard - model .",
    "furthermore , we want to mention that most of the constraints on the @xmath7 scale are weakened in our scenario .",
    "we introduce modifications of quantum mechanics caused by the existence of a minimal length scale @xmath43 .",
    "we show that our approach is consistent with other calculations on this topic .",
    "assuming the recent proposition of large extra dimensions , the new scale might be accessible in colliders .",
    "we use perturbation theory to derive the @xmath2 cross sections with an approximated interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we compare our results to recent data and find that the limits on the new scale are compatible to those from different experimental constraints : @xmath278 tev .",
    "our model combines both large extra dimensions and the minimal length scale and predicts dropping cross sections relative to the standard model cross sections .",
    "further , we argue that the analysed planckian effects hinder the emergence of other effects which are predicted above @xmath279 tev , such as black hole and graviton production .",
