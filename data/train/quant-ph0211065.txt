    "there has been considerable interest in recent years for the fascinating properties of coherently prepared atomic media @xcite . among the most studied coherent effects",
    "is the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "eit has generally been modelled and experimentally studied in three - level @xmath7 systems with two long lived lower ( ground ) states and a rapidly decaying upper ( excited ) state .",
    "the two electromagnetic fields ( pump and probe ) separately couple each of the two arms of the @xmath7 system . a distinctive feature of the eit resonance is its narrow linewidth which corresponds to the coherence decay rate of the ground state doublet .",
    "the occurrence of the eit resonance is directly linked to the existence of a dark state ( ds ) : i.e. a linear combination of the two ground states uncoupled to the excited state .",
    "eit is a consequence of the system being pumped into the ds .",
    "eit may also be observed in multi - level systems as those involving the zeeman substates of two atomic levels with angular momentum degeneracy , hereafter called degenerate two - level systems ( dtls ) . in such case too , the observation of eit is a direct consequence of the existence of a ds within the lower atomic level when @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the angular momenta of the ground and excited state respectively ) .",
    "the pump - probe spectroscopy of dtls with @xmath11 also presents resonances in the probe transmission when the raman resonance condition between ground state zeeman sublevels is fulfilled .",
    "however , in this case , the resonances correspond to an increase of the probe absorption and have consequently being designated as electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) @xcite . as in the case of eit resonances ,",
    "the eia linewidth is given by the coherence decay rate of the ground level .",
    "unlike eit , the eia resonances can not be associated to the existence of a ds in the ground state .",
    "also , there is no simple connection between the eia resonances and the existence of a ds in the _ excited _ state since such state has a lifetime limited by spontaneous emission and can not account for the narrow spectral features observed .",
    "an explanation for the eia resonance was provided by taichenachev et al @xcite analyzing a four level system in a @xmath12 configuration .",
    "they showed theoretically that in this system , which is the simplest to present eia , the enhanced absorption is due to the transfer , via spontaneous emission , of the coherence created by the exciting fields within the two upper levels .",
    "although the @xmath12 configuration does not correspond to the configurations actually explored in realistic dtls , the argument presented in @xcite can be extended to such systems @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide experimental evidence in support of the argument presented in @xcite by demonstrating that eia resonances are suppressed ( and even reversed ) if the coherence of the excited state is significantly destroyed by collisions before the occurrence of the spontaneous emission decay . a simple theoretical model in good agreement with the observations is also presented .",
    "a convenient experimental scheme for the observation of coherence resonances is the hanle type setup that uses a unique optical beam with linear polarization in near resonance with an atomic transition . in this scheme ,",
    "the two opposite circular polarization components of the light can be considered as the pump and probe fields .",
    "the light beam is sent through an atomic sample where the raman resonance condition is tuned , via the zeeman effect , by a magnetic field along the light propagation axis .",
    "the intensity of the transmitted light is monitored .",
    "hanle / eit / eia resonances on the @xmath13 lines of alkaline vapors were recently studied by several groups @xcite ( see inset in fig . [ isotope ] for an energy level scheme of the @xmath1rb @xmath13 line ) .",
    "dancheva et al @xcite were the first to observe a hanle / eia resonance on a @xmath14 transition of the @xmath0 line .",
    "they pointed out the fact that the eia resonance can be observed in spite of the transition being open ( radiative decay can occur from the excited state to either ground state hyperfine levels ) .",
    "the open character of the transition is responsible for the smallness of the hanle / eia resonance as compared with the hanle / eit resonances occurring when @xmath15 .",
    "the choice of the hanle experimental scheme for coherent spectroscopy is not only motivated by its simplicity .",
    "it also allows a special insight on the connection between coherence resonance and optical pumping .",

    "the quantization axis has been chosen parallel to the direction of the light propagation which coincides with the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the raman resonance condition is achieved for the two components of the optical field at zero magnetic field and destroyed for nonzero magnetic field . in fig.[levelschemes]a ) the optical field interact with a @xmath7 system for which eit is known to occur as a consequence of the existence of a ds formed by the anti - symmetric combination of the ground state zeeman sublevels @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "[ levelschemes]c ) the transparency observed for zero magnetic field is the consequence of the optical pumping of the system into the @xmath18 and @xmath20 sublevels which are not coupled to the excited state . in fig .",
    "[ levelschemes]d ) the absorption increase for @xmath21 is a consequence of the redistribution of the population of the ground state zeeman sublevels ( alignment ) via optical pumping .",
    "the atomic population accumulates preferentially in the @xmath22 sublevel which has the largest coupling with the excited state . notice",
    "that with this choice of the quantization axis , no coherence is built among the excited state zeeman sublevels and thus can not be transferred to the ground state . in the basis used in c ) and d ) the hanle / eit and hanle / eia resonances appear as a consequence of incoherent optical pumping .",
    "since the choice of the quantization axis is arbitrary , the two frames considered in the previous discussion can conveniently be considered for the analysis of the hanle / eia resonances under the effect of collisions affecting the excited state . in the scheme of fig .",
    "[ levelschemes]b ) which can be considered as an extension of the simple @xmath12 system analyzed by taichenachev et al @xcite , eia is a consequence of the spontaneous transfer of zeeman coherence from the excited to the ground state . in consequence ,",
    "the eia resonance should disappear if the excited state coherence is destroyed by collisions in a time comparable or shorter than the excited state lifetime . in the basis corresponding to fig .",
    "[ levelschemes]d ) eia can be prevented if the collisions are responsible for a significant equalization ( thermalization ) of the excited state sublevel populations before the occurrence of spontaneous emission ( fig .",
    "[ levelschemes]e ) .",
    "if the excited state is completely thermalized then the total spontaneous emission decay into a given ground state zeeman sublevel is the same for all ground state sublevels . in consequence , in the steady state , the population is preferentially accumulated in sublevels @xmath23 resulting in an increased transparency .    to demonstrate the influence of the excited state coherence on eia we have observed the hanle / eit / eia resonances corresponding to the four transitions of the @xmath13 line of @xmath1rb both in a vapor cell containing only rb vapor ( negligible collisions ) and in a cell containing @xmath4 of ne as buffer gas .",
    "it is well known that room temperature collisions with light noble gas atoms ( he , ne , ar ) produce different effects on the @xmath24 ground state than in the @xmath25 or @xmath26 excited states of several alkaline vapors @xcite .",
    "the collisions of a noble gas atom with an alkaline atoms in its ground state has little effect on its electronic and nuclear spin . as a consequence",
    "the alkaline atom can experience a very large number of collisions while preserving the ground state coherence .",
    "however , the atomic motion is affected by collisions becoming diffusive .",
    "this results in a longer interaction time before the atoms can leave the light beam or reach the cell walls .",
    "the increased interaction time allows the observation of coherence resonances with time - of - flight limited linewidth of only a few tenth of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the situation is rather different for collisions between noble gas atoms and alkaline atoms in the @xmath28 state@xcite . at room temperature and for the buffer gas density corresponding to the experiments described below",
    ", the collisions are sufficiently energetic and frequent to produce a considerable broadening of the homogeneous width of the optical transitions ( which remains nevertheless smaller than the doppler width and the @xmath28 hyperfine splitting ) . also under such conditions",
    "virtual transitions to the neighboring levels ( mainly @xmath29 ) occur @xcite resulting in the non preservation of the magnetic quantum number ( @xmath30 ) of the electronic angular momentum during collisions . as a consequence ,",
    "a significant thermalization of the excited state density matrix take place in a time shorter than the excited state lifetime .",
    "the cross section for excited state collisional @xmath30 mixing was measured by several authors @xcite .",
    "using the figures in @xcite and the ne density corresponding to the experiments the collisional decoherence rate of the excited state @xmath31 can be estimated as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the excited state spontaneous emission decay rate .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . we have used two cylindrical vapor cells of the same dimensions ( diameter : @xmath34 , length : @xmath35 ) provided by the same manufacturer and filled with natural rubidium vapor .",
    "one of the cells contains @xmath4 of ne as buffer gas .",
    "the cell under consideration was placed ( at room temperature ) inside a magnetic shield formed by three coaxial cylindrical @xmath36-metal layers .",
    "after degaussing of the @xmath36-metal shield the total inhomogeneity of the residual magnetic field at the vapor cell was less than @xmath37 .",
    "a coaxial solenoid , internal to the magnetic shield was used to scan the magnetic field at the atomic sample .",
    "an extended cavity diode laser ( @xmath38 linewidth ) was used for the atomic excitation .",
    "the laser frequency was monitored and stabilized on specific hyperfine transitions with the help of an auxiliary saturated absorption setup .",
    "the total laser power at the sample was approximately @xmath39 .",
    "the light transmitted through the vapor cell was monitored with a photodiode ( @xmath40 bandwidth ) .    in order to enhance sensitivity",
    "the coherence resonances were detected through a parametric resonance technique @xcite .",
    "in addition to the slowly varying dc magnetic field , a small ac component of the magnetic field ( oriented along the light propagation axis ) was introduced with a secondary coil driven at frequency @xmath41 .",
    "a lock - in amplifier detected the phase and quadrature components of the photodiode current oscillating at frequency @xmath41 .",
    "two different values of @xmath41 were used in the measurements .",
    "for the cell without buffer gas we used @xmath42 and for the cell containing ne @xmath43 was used . in both cases @xmath41 was chosen to exceed the width of the corresponding hanle resonances . a typical recording of the lock - in output signal as a function of the solenoid dc current",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ expbuffbroad ] .",
    "the central structure of the spectrum corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrum sidebands occurring for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the ground state zeeman energy shift ) allow a precise calibration of the magnetic field inside the solenoid .    in the cell containing the buffer gas  where the resonances are well resolved ( fig .",
    "[ expbuffbroad ] ) the parametric resonance scheme used in the experiment allows for isotope selective spectroscopy . for this , the dc magnetic field is kept fixed at the value corresponding to the maximum of one of the ( lorentzian ) sidebands resonances observed on the quadrature signal and the quadrature output of the lock - in amplifier is monitored while the frequency of the laser is scanned on the @xmath13 line .",
    "since the resonance condition @xmath46 depends on the specific isotope through the gyromagnetic factor @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the bohr magneton ) , only one isotope contributes to the observed spectrum .",
    "an example of such spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "the gyromagnetic factors of the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of @xmath1rb differ in absolute value by less than @xmath51 .",
    "consequently all four hyperfine transitions can be observed in the same spectrum .",
    "notice that the hyperfine structure is well resolved in the spectrum of fig.[isotope ] .",
    "this is a clear indication that in spite of the rather strong collisional regime , the atomic level structure resulting from the hyperfine coupling is preserved and that the total angular momentum @xmath52 remains a good quantum number .",

    "in the cell with buffer gas ( fig .",
    "[ expbuffer ] ) , the observed resonances are much narrower as expected from the increase in interaction time due to the diffusive atomic motion . however , under the present experimental conditions the observed linewidth is limited by residual magnetic field inhomogeneities . a sign change is clearly observed for the @xmath59 transition with respect to the cell without ne demonstrating the quenching of the eia resonance and its reversal into eit .",
