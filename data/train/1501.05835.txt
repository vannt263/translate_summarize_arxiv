    "it is well known that one of the major causes of building degradation is the crystallization of salts into the porous matrix @xcite .",
    "salt is present inside building stones as free ions : it can be a natural element of the material , created by reaction with atmospheric pollutants or introduced by water solutions penetrating into the porous matrix by capillarity @xcite .",
    "the latter is the main mechanism leading to buildig damage and has received much attention from the scientific investigation @xcite but remains not yet fully understood .",
    "salt decay requires the simultaneous presence of soluble salts and water in the porous material , as well as appropriate environmental conditions .",
    "indeed , it originates from salt - ions ( e.g. chloride , nitrate , sulphate ) that migrate while dissolved in liquid water which flows in the pore network of building materials .",
    "liquid water may penetrate these materials by different processes , including hygroscopic moisture , penetration of rainwater ( through , e.g. construction joints , damaged roofs , and cracks ) , dew point condensation , and rising damp .",
    "the latter is probably the most frequent and perhaps one of the most difficult sources of water to remove , when dealing with old buildings .",
    "consider an initially dry porous stone ( such as a masonry brick ) that is wetted by a salt water solution . during the wetting phase",
    ", water fills up the stone bringing the dissolved salt present in the outside environment .",
    "if the stone is in contact with ambient air , water molecules are exchanged with the environment by evaporation thus starting a drying phase ; the rate of dehydration depends on the relative humidity of the atmosphere . at this point ,",
    "salt content in water increases and solution may become supersaturated .",
    "once a high degree of supersaturation is reached , salt starts crystallizing : if crystals are formed inside the porous matrix we talk of _ subflorescence _ or _ cryptoflorescence _ ; if crystallization takes place on the exterior boundaries of the stone we talk of _ efflorescence_. _ subflorescence _ causes the formation of large crystals into the pores : once the pres1e exerted by these crystals exceeds the tensile strength of the porous matrix , it can lead to widespread loss of surface , e.g. exfoliation , detachments .",
    "the occurrence of _ efflorescence _ or _ subflorescence _",
    "( _ cryptoflorescence _ ) depends on several factors including salt type and concentration , microclimate , evaporation rate @xcite , substrate porosity characteristics @xcite and surface tension and viscosity of the solution @xcite .",
    "the in - pore crystallization causes a reduction of the pore volume , breaking the liquid network and delaying water transport .",
    "since pore clogging affects the location and quantity of crystals , it might have implications for stress development and deterioration of the material @xcite .",
    "common constructions contain different kind of salts such as chlorides , sulphates , nitrates , and carbonates , with their own solubility , crystalline structure and crystallization properties . among these",
    ", sodium sulphate is probably one of the most complex and damaging salt types involved in salt decay processes .",
    "indeed , this salt has three different phases of crystallization at various microclimate conditions , can easily supersaturate and has a solubility which is highly temperature dependent @xcite .",
    "both crystallization and hydration transformations in sodium sulphate , resulting in significant volumetric changes , have been blamed for the destructive mode of action of this salt @xcite .    one way to prevent",
    "the stone breakage is to treat the porous material with a substance that inhibit _ subflorescence _ : these crystallization inhibitors reduce the pressure associated with the growing crystals trying to keep it below the breakage modulus of the substrate .",
    "the organic as well as inorganic ion and molecule additives alter the surface properties of the crystals which lead to changes in nucleation , growth , and thereby changes in the shape of the crystals as well as in their agglomeration / dispersion behaviour .",
    "examples of well - known additives with extended technological and industrial uses are the families of ( poly)phosphates , carboxylates , polyacrylic acid derivatives , and benzotriazoles @xcite .",
    "these additives are widely used as scale - inhibitors to prevent undesired effects associated with sparingly soluble salts ( e.g. sulphates , carbonates ) precipitating in oil extraction pipelines @xcite industrial boilers , heat exchangers , house appliances or water pipes @xcite and others .",
    "the effectiveness of a given inhibitor depends on many variables : salt type , pore structure properties of the substrate , application methodology , the composition of the inhibiting solution to cite a few .",
    "hence , a given modifier has to be evaluated for each stone and for each salt @xcite . on the other hand , adding a crystal inhibitor does not affect surface tension nor contact angle of the wetting liquid , since there have not been observed any significant effect on solution transport @xcite .",
    "although the effectiveness of some salt crystallization inhibitors in bulk solution has been proved , the possibility of using these products for the prevention of salt decay in building materials is still controversial because it is not clear how these inhibitors act .",
    "however , experiments suggest two possible mechanisms @xcite : _ nucleation delay _ enhances salt transport toward the surface , thus increasing efflorescence ; _ crystal habit modification _ by absorption on specific faces of a growing crystal that decreases crystal growth rate .",
    "another matter of discussion is the fact that crystal reduction would result in higher supersaturated solutions .",
    "it has been speculated , but not actually observed , that in this case the inhibitor may promote salt precipitation at higher supersaturation levels and , hence , the quick formation of large crystals .",
    "therefore , a modifier would eventually increase the crystal pressure and the risk of damage instead of reducing it @xcite .",
    "our group has undertaken a broad research project @xcite focusing on the effects of environment - friendly , non - invasive inhibitor systems on saline solutions percolating and crystallizing in a porous media following evaporation , in order to develop a sound methodology suitable for addressing the conservation needs of different salt - weathered sites .",
    "our attention has been particularly focused on the crystallization inhibition properties of functionalized polycarboxylates ( i.e. maleate , citrate , phosphocitrate , tartrate ) , with an emphasis on the phosphorylated family members .",
    "indeed we have demonstrated that phosphocitrate ( pc ) has been revealed to be one of the most promising inhibitors , because of its effectiveness in controlling the crystallization of different salts ( i.e. sodium sulphate , sodium chloride , sodium nitrate , calcium carbonate ) and salt mixtures in a wide range of porous materials and in various ambient conditions .    in this work we developed a mathematical model describing the effect of phosphocitrate ( pc ) on sodium sulphate crystallization inside a brick s porous matrix .",
    "there are plenty of mathematical models describing salt crystallization in porous stone .",
    "they consists of 3d multiphase systems of equations for heat and mass transport with various degree of complexity .",
    "some models might also couple the governing equations with other effects : osmosis , stress tensor deformations and latent heat release due to salt crystals formation @xcite . for the present study we have developed a simple mathematical model of salt and water transport and crystal formation . in fact , we limit our research to the considerations on few available data , which can be obtained using simple laboratory equipments , and",
    "so it would not have made sense to include further effects .",
    "moreover , since the experiments were carried out in laboratory at constant temperature , we did not consider directly temperature variations ; we just included evaporation rate into the porous stone simply by defining an appropriate sink term in the water balance equation .",
    "actually , this work is a preliminary study to describe mathematically the effects of inhibitors inside a porous stone : to our knowledge , this is the first attempt to develop a mathematical model for the effects of crystallization modifiers . as we shall see , we identified two model parameters that will be crucial for the appropriate description of an inhibitor :    @xmath0 : :    the crystallization rate taking into account the nucleation rate ; @xmath1 : :    the specific volume of precipitated salt , describing the crystal habit    modification .",
    "these two parameters will be determined by the numerical calibration of our model - i.e. by comparing our numerical results with the available experimental data - for both the treated and non treated case .",
    "the remain of our paper is organized as follows : the second section will describe the materials considered and the experiments performed ; the third and fourth sections will introduce the mathematical model and describe the numerical scheme applied to solve the system equations ; in section five we will describe our results .",
    "the paper ends up with few conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the experimental settings we are going to consider @xcite .",
    "commercially produced brick is tested .",
    "bulk density @xmath2 was determined by weighing and measuring of dimensions of dry prismatic samples .",
    "the matrix density @xmath3 was measured by helium pycnometer .",
    "the porosity @xmath4 $ ] was calculated according to the equation @xmath5 the porosity determined in this way is @xmath6 .",
    "pore size distribution was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry ( mip ) by carlo erba instrument on a about 1 g of material .",
    "all experiments were performed in air conditioned laboratory at @xmath7c and @xmath8 rh .",
    "table [ tab : poredis ] shows the pore size distribution of the considered brick .",
    ".pore size distribution in the brick under consideration .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we developed a mathematical model to describe the action of crystallization inhibitors into a porous stone .",
    "this simple model is able to capture the main features of the inhibitor from experiments carried out on a set of commercially available bricks . according to the current knowledge",
    ", the model describes the action of inhibitors through two coefficients : crystallization rate , @xmath0 , taking into account nucleation , and the specific volume @xmath1 , taking into account the crystal habit modification . from the calibration of the mathematical model described in section [ sec : mathmodel ]",
    ", we found out that the action of phosphocitrate ( pc ) increases the crystallization rate and decreases the crystal specific volume .",
    "this means that , although crystals form faster in the presence of the inhibitor , nevertheless they occupy a smaller volume , thus lowering the development of tensile stresses , and , on the other hand , ensuring the hydraulic continuity into the porous stones . in the future , we will repeat the same study varying the materials and with more detailed experiments in order to test and improve our mathematical model .",
    "our aim is to end up with a sound simulation tool to investigate crystallization modifier .",
