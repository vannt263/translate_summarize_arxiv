    "a major thrust of astronomy in the 21st century is to study , observationally and with theoretical inquiry , time - variable phenomena in the night sky .",
    "this area is broadly referred to as time domain astronomy ( tda ) and its high scientific priority was established by the astro2010 report ( national research council , 2010 ) .",
    "their highest recommendation for large telescope ground - based observing , for example , was to build the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .",
    "in advance of that ambitious project , several projects are using wide - field cameras to image large areas of the sky at high cadence .",
    "this includes the partially nsf - sponsored palomar transient factory ( ptf ) and its nsf / msip funded follow - on ( ztf ) , and the pan - starrs surveys which repeatedly image the full northern sky , finding hundreds of new transient phenomena on every clear night .",
    "these surveys are discovering thousands of supernovae , immense samples of asteroids and near - earth objects , variable stars of diverse nature , flaring phenomena , and other exotic sources . these advances in tda observing at optical wavelengths follow decades of tda science performed at higher energies from space .",
    "indeed , the first astronomical sources detected with @xmath0-rays were themselves transient phenomena : the so - called @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "satellites like nasa s swift and fermi monitor @xmath1 steradians of the sky , scanning for transient and variable high - energy events .",
    "the focus of most previous and on - going tda projects has been wide - field imaging of the sky in search of rare and new classes of events . to fully explore and exploit the astrophysics of newly discovered sources , however",
    ", one must establish the redshift and/or the type of object responsible .",
    "optical and infrared wavelengths remain the most powerful and efficient passbands to perform the required spectroscopy .",
    "this is the primary role of large , ground - based observatories in tda science . recognizing their value , several 8m - class observatories have established very effective observing strategies ( generally at great expense ) to perform such science .",
    "both the gemini and european southern observatories ( eso ) designed their largest telescopes with systems that could rapidly feed any of the available foci .",
    "furthermore , they designed queue operations to enable rapid responses to targets - of - opportunity ( toos ) and programs that repeatedly observe a source for short intervals at high cadence . successes of this model include time - resolved spectroscopy of varying absorption lines from a grb afterglow on minute time - scales and high - cadence monitoring of the galactic center to recover high fidelity orbital parameters .",
    "keck observatory ( wmko ) boasts twin 10 m telescopes , currently the largest aperture , fully - operational optical / ir telescopes . over the course of the past  20 years , we have successfully instrumented each telescope with high - throughput imagers and spectrometers spanning wavelengths from the atmospheric cutoff to several microns .",
    "the keck i ( k1 ) telescope hosts the nasmyth - mounted hires spectrograph , one of the primary tools for obtaining high - resolution visible wavelength spectra from tda observations .",
    "k1 also hosts the nasmyth - mounted keck i adaptive optics ( ao ) system with a high - performance laser guide star ( lgs ) system , and now hosts the near - ir integral field spectrograph osiris , a key tool for synoptic observations of the galactic center .",
    "two k1 instruments are used at cassegrain : the lris multi - object visible wavelength spectrograph and the near - ir multi - object spectrograph and imager mosfire .",
    "this is a unique instrument suite , especially within the u.s .",
    "community : the hires spectrometer is the only echelle spectrometer on a large aperture telescope in the northern hemisphere ; lris provides extremely sensitive spectroscopy especially at blue ( @xmath2 ) and red ( @xmath3 ) wavelengths , and mosfire represents a unique capability for multi - slit , near - ir spectroscopy in the northern hemisphere .    by its nature , tda science demands a more nimble and flexible approach to observations than the traditionally , classically - scheduled observing which has been the standard at wmko .",
    "most tda programs require observations made with a specific instrument at specific times , while classical scheduling on a telescope with multiple instrument configurations may mean that the desired instrument will not be available for the tda program . in the current configuration of the keck telescopes a removable module , called the tertiary module , which contains the telescope tertiary mirror ( m3 ) ,",
    "is used to support observations with nasmyth and bent cassegrain mounted instruments . the desired instrument along the elevation axis ring",
    "is selected by rotating the tertiary mirror around the telescope optical axis . to install and use a cassegrain mounted instrument",
    ", the tertiary module must be removed from the telescope which is a process typically requires daycrew .",
    "the k1 deployable tertiary ( k1dm3 ) will directly address these shortcomings , enabling wmko to fully and vigorously participate in tda science with its unique set of k1 instruments . as the driving paradigm in observational astronomy shifts from a passive , static sky to one that displays dramatic changes on a nightly basis , it is critical to enhance our technical capabilities in this arena .",
    "the k1dm3 will increase the flexibility for too and cadence observations with the nasmyth , bent cassegrain , and whichever cassegrain instrument is installed in the telescope , without requiring any configuration change other than rotating the tertiary mirror to the appropriate focal station or retracting the mirror from the telescope beam .",
    "the k1dm3 will also reduce the time required for telescope reconfigurations by eliminating the need to remove or install the tertiary mirror module .",
    "we proposed successfully to the national science foundation ( nsf ) major research instrumentation ( mri ) program in 2013 for funding of the k1dm3 project .",
    "we received the full award requested and the total project budget ( $ 2.1 m usd ) includes a 30% cost - share from wmko , the uc observatories , and the university of california santa cruz .",
    "the project entered its detailed design phase in october 2015 and this paper presents the detailed design .",
    "the k1dm3 device will enable astronomers to swap between any of the foci on keck 1 in under 2 minutes , both to monitor varying sources ( e.g. stars orbiting the galactic center ) and rapidly fading sources ( e.g. supernovae , flares , gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "the design consists of a passive wiffle tree axial support system and a flexure - rod lateral support system with a 4.7arcminute field - of - view mirror .",
    "the mirror assembly is inserted into the light path with an actuation system and it relies on kinematic couplings for achieving repeatable , precise positioning .",
    "the actuation system may rotate ( partially when retracted or fully when deployed ) on two bearings mechanized with a pair of drive motors .",
    "it is our goal to commission k1dm3 at wmko by march 2017 .",
    "figure  [ fig : k1dm3_overview ] shows the overall configuration of the k1dm3 module and the module installed in the tertiary tower .",
    "the k1dm3 module consists of a light - weighted fixed outer drum and a moveable inner drum .",
    "the inner drum is supported at each end by 4-point contact ball bearings .",
    "the lower bearing has a ring gear that is driven with a pinion gear by a servo motor system .",
    "an absolute position encoder is used to measure the position of the rotating drum .",
    "the tertiary mirror is supported by axial and lateral supports attached to a whiffle tree structure .",
    "this whiffle tree connects the mirror and support structure to a swing arm system . in turn",
    ", this swing arm moves the mirror between the deployed and retracted positions , driven by two linear actuators .",
    "the top of the drum supports the swing arm in the deployed position through a bipod structure with two defining points ( at the right side of the figure ) and a third defining point at the hinge point of the swing arm ( the third defining point is not visible in the figure ) .",
    "the swing arm is locked in the deployed position by a set of 4 clamping mechanisms .",
    "no power is required to maintain the mirror in either the deployed or retracted positions . in order to set the swing arm into the kinematics",
    ", the deployment process will be performed at the elevation angle where the kinematics are oriented normal to gravity ( ) .",
    "we will retract the mirror at specific rotation angles , one of two positions where power and ethernet is supplied to the swing arm .",
    "full rotation of the module drum is possible with the mirror deployed .",
    "interference with items at the top of the tertiary tower limit the rotation when k1dm3 is retracted .",
    "when the mirror is deployed , there are six positions used to direct the light to one of the two nasmyth focal stations or one of the four bent cassegrain positions .",
    "each of these deployed positions is held by a detent mechanism engaging a v - groove .",
    "the detent mechanism is engaged by a pneumatic cylinder and retracted by a spring .",
    "the k1dm3 module is inserted into the tertiary tower from the telescope s cassegrain platform and moved through the tertiary tower to its operating position on a pair of rails .",
    "guide rollers mounted on the outer drum support the module on the tracks . when the module is installed in the tower it is held in position using three defining point mechanisms equipped with kinematic mounting points that are engaged and disengaged by three air motors .",
    "the kinematic mounting points ensure repeatable positioning .",
    "k1dm3 is designed to be coated with al at wmko .",

    "the k1dm3 team generated a requirements document to help guide the design of our module @xcite .",
    "below is a short list of key requirements that have the most impact to our design .",
    "this paper will focus on the opto - mechanical design ; a brief summary of electronics and software is given in the appendix .",
    "the k1dm3 tertiary mirror will be sized to provide an unvignetted 4.7 arcminute diameter field of view at the nasmyth foci .",
    "the k1dm3 module will not vignette the lris or mosfire fovs when the mirror is fully retracted .",
    "the k1dm3 system will not vignette m1 or m2 when the mirror is deployed or retracted .",
    "the surface of the k1dm3 mirror will give an 80% enclosed energy ee80 in a 0.054arcsecond diameter aperture .",
    "this corresponds to a surface flatness specification of 9.7e-7 ( rms ) slope error@xcite .",
    "the mirror shall be supplied uncoated and shall be coated with bare aluminum by wmko .",
    "the following requirements primarily concern the motion of the k1dm3 system when installed",
    ".    the mirror will deploy or retract in less than 120 seconds .",
    "the k1dm3 module shall be provided with a rotator mechanism that serves to point the deployed tertiary mirror at the desired keck i nasmyth or bent cassegrain focal position by rotating the mirror about the telescope optical axis . when the mirror is positioned at one of the six focal station positions it shall be locked in place by a detent or other means .",
    "when deployed , the mirror will be able to rotate about the telescope optical axis at a speed of at least 6degrees . per second .",
    "the k1dm3 module shall not radiate more than 5 watts of heat into the telescope dome ambient environment during an observation .",
    "the k1dm3 module must not weigh more than 1000 kg .",
    "the structure of the k1dm3 module shall meet the zone 4 earthquake survival requirements of telcordia standard gr-63-core , `` nebstm requirements '' .",
    "the current m3 is offset from this ideal position , because of the as - built locations of m1 and m2 , the as - built tertiary tower , and/or errors in the original alignment procedure @xcite . because the nasmyth instruments on k1 ( hires , osiris ) have been aligned to the existing m1-m2-m3 telescope",
    ", we endeavor to replicate ( to a specified tolerance ) the position of the current m3 .",
    "the following requirements describe performance of the system when deployed relative to the desired location for the k1dm3 mirror . again , this `` desired location '' may or may not be the optimal position for a perfect telescope system ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "regarding the stability of k1dm3 positioning during an observation ( e.g. to vibrations ) , established convention is to allow uncorrelated effects on image quality at the level of 10% of the seeing disk .",
    "based on this convention , for 0.4arcseconds seeing , translation of the mirror along the telescope x or z axes should be no more than 29 microns .",
    "we adopt this as an rms constraint .",
    "confining the motion to @xmath4microns ( rms ) places a stability requirement on tip and tilt of the tertiary of 0.65arcseconds and 0.46arcseconds ( rms ) .    synthesizing the above discussion",
    ", we derive the following requirements regarding the positioning of the k1dm3 mirror when deployed :    the k1dm3 mirror will position to an accuracy of 725 microns along the telescope x and z axes ( rms ) .",
    "we adopt the same requirement for repeatability .    the k1dm3 mirror will position to the nominal rotations of tilt and tip to 11.5arcsecond and 16.5arcsecond ( rms ) respectively .",
    "we adopt the same requirement for repeatability@xcite .",
    "the k1dm3 mirror will be held stable to displacements in the telescope x and z axes to 29 microns ( rms ) .",
    "the k1dm3 mirror will not move in tip and tilt due to external influences ( vibration ) by more than 0.65arcseconds and 0.46arcseconds ( rms ) respectively .",
    "the following list of requirements relate to the interface between the k1dm3 system and the k1 telescope .",
    "the k1dm3 module shall be designed for installation in the keck i tertiary tower using the same defining points provided for the existing keck i tertiary mirror module .",
    "all adjustments to align the k1dm3 module in the telescope shall be made by adjusting the defining point halves located on the k1dm3 module .",
    "the k1dm3 module shall be compatible with the existing module insertion and removal rails provided in the keck i tertiary tower .",
    "the k1dm3 tertiary mirror shall be removable for recoating and shall be provided with an adapter as required to permit the use of the existing keck i tertiary mirror handling fixture when the mirror is removed for recoating .",
    "the k1dm3 system will provide a new tertiary mirror for the nasmyth and bent - cassegrain foci of the keck i telescope .",
    "the flat mirror is made of zerodur glass and is shaped as an ellipse with major axis 2a = 901.1 mm and minor axis 2b = 643.0 mm , and a thickness of 44.5 mm .",
    "it has an approximate mass of 51.74 kg .",
    "the k1dm3 project obtained the mirror blank from the tmt project , on permanent loan , and a second blank as a spare .",
    "the mirror was fabricated by zygo and has been delivered to uco ( figure  [ fig : mirror ] ) .",
    "the figured mirror has an edge exclusion of approximately 15 mm width around the outer circumference that has poorer image quality .",
    "this reduces the clear aperture fov to approximately  ( see @xcite for further details ) . within the clear aperture ,",
    "the mirror was polished by zygo to 0.2 nm ( rms ) surface roughness ( figure  [ fig : mirror ] ) and to meet a ( 60 - 40 ) scratch / dig surface quality per mil - prf-13830b .",
    "the non - optical surface finish is r2 ground flat , 400 grit finish or better .",
    "the reflective surface was polished to a p - v of 57 nm and a surface error of 6 nm .",
    "the mirror will be delivered uncoated and later coated with bare aluminum using the coating chamber at wmko .",
    "multi - layered - protected silver coatings were considered by the project but deemed too expensive given the associated risks with transport and handling .",
    "-0.1 in        a key aspect of the k1dm3 system is to enable observations with the mounted cassegrain instrument by retracting the tertiary mirror out of the beam on demand .",
    "this is a unique functionality in comparison to the existing tertiary module .",
    "we have designed k1dm3 accordingly and have also considered carefully the dimensions and positions of the module and retracted mirror to avoid vignetting the light arriving at the cassegrain focus .",
    "we summarize the main issues that have been addressed and refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "we face significant challenges when m3 is retracted to avoid vignetting the rays from m1 to m2 and , at the same time , avoid vignetting the rays from m2 to the cassegrain instruments .",
    "an additional concern is vignetting related to the lris adc ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "when m3 is retracted , it will be held above the module and the tertiary tower with the reflective surface facing away from the optical axis as shown on the left side of figure  [ fig : retract ] ) . in this position",
    ", we must avoid the rays travelling to m1 and ( more importantly ) the converging rays from m1 to m2 .",
    "we will retract the center of m3 to this position : a height of 267.16 mm above the elevation axis and radially offset by 759 mm from the optical axis , and at an angle @xmath5degrees ( where @xmath6degrees is the deployed position and @xmath7degrees is parallel to the optical axis ) .",
    "the result is no vignetting of the converging rays from m1 to m2 over the full 20arcminute cassegrain fov .",
    "-0.1 in    presently , there are two cassegrain instruments commissioned on keck i ( with none additional currently planned ) : lris with a 6arcminute x 8arcminute fov located 7arcminute off - axis and mosfire with an on - axis fov of 6.14arcminute x 6.14arcminute .",
    "each instrument has an off - axis guide camera .",
    "the rectangular fields of view of the science and guide cameras for lris and mosfire generate rounded `` footprints '' normal to the optical axis that one must avoid to prevent vignetting .",
    "the dimensions and shape of these footprints decrease as the beam converges from m2 to the cassegrain focus ( i.e. as a function of elevation along the optical axis ) .",
    "analysis of vignetting of the retracted k1dm3 mirror on rays traveling from m1 to m2 was performed with the zemax software package .",
    "we implemented the user - defined aperture ( uda ) for the keck primary mirror , a circular m2 mirror with radius of 700 mm , and the apertures needed to represent the m2 spider .",
    "in addition , we modeled obscuration by the tertiary tower as a hexagon with sides of 880.4 mm placed at a height of 3451.6 mm above the primary .",
    "we also modeled the obscuration by the secondary structure as a hexagon with sides of 1.32 m.",
    "lastly , we calculated the vignetting of rays by the retracted m3 as an elliptical aperture held at the position defined above .",
    "the secondary mounting structure casts a sizable shadow on the surface of m1 .",
    "the retracted k1dm3 fits entirely within this shadow .",
    "the rays converging from m1 to m2 present a tighter constraint , but we find that k1dm3 does not vignette any of these rays if the angle of the retracted mirror is less than approximately 105degrees .",
    "the footprints described above were generated with an idl code using simple geometrical arguments and the known dimensions of the k1 telescope .",
    "we then generated udas at several heights above the primary and imported these within the as- built zemax models for the lris and mosfire designs .",
    "we verified with zemax that these footprints are correctly sized .",
    "for a view from above . , width=480 ]",
    "the mirror for k1dm3 requires a support structure that will ( i ) maintain the mirror s figure under varying gravity vectors and temperature changes ; ( ii ) interface the mirror with the deployment ( swing arm ) mechanism ; ( iii ) ensure the safety of the system during an earthquake ; and ( iv ) provide a means to coat the mirror within the wmko coating chamber .    for axial support",
    ", the k1dm3 design uses six rods inserted into pucks glued to the back ( i.e. non - reflective ) side of the mirror .",
    "these rods are 1.7 mm in diameter , have 60 mm free length , and will be made of aisi m2 steel .",
    "the pucks are invar and will be glued with an epoxy adhesive .",
    "the axial rods are screwed into the pucks .",
    "the layout of these six axial support rods is shown in figure  [ fig : axial_support ] .",
    "the positions for the rods were determined from finite element analysis ( fea ) to minimize the deflections of the mirror normal to its surface .",
    "these were updated to reflect the final dimensions of the mirror .",
    "-0.1 in    lateral support is provided by three flexure rods fastened to pucks glued to the mirror s edge , similar to the axial flexure rods .",
    "these are at approximately the major axis of one side and two other positions opposite ( figure  [ fig : lateral_support ] ) .",
    "these rods are 125 mm free - length and 3.0 mm in diameter , and are aisi m2 steel .",
    "the pucks were designed to ensure a less than 15micron difference in the glue thickness across the surface .",
    "for expected temperature changes , the design results in 130psi ( static ) and 655psi ( dynamic ) of stress in the bonds and glass .",
    "these stresses are significantly smaller than the estimated 3000psi of stress that the bonds can endure and are also significantly smaller than the limits that we wish to maintain for zerodur .",
    "-0.1 in    the axial and lateral rods are integrated within a whiffle - tree support system , shown in figure  [ fig : whiffle ] .",
    "the whiffle tree uses 0.75inch diameter struts ( 5/32inches thick ) in a determinate truss pattern .",
    "it allows the mirror assembly to be bolted to the deployment system and then removed for re - coating .",
    "the total mass of the mirror assembly including the mirror is estimated to be 70 kg .",
    "-0.1 in    the mirror assembly includes three kinematic fixtures ( 0.5meter radius spheres in v - grooves ) that interface it with the swing arm assembly .",
    "this allows one to remove the mirror assembly from the k1dm3 system for coating .",
    "it then enables one to repeatably and precisely reattach the mirror assembly to the swing arm assembly .",
    "the design also allows for fine adjustment of the kinematics during the alignment phase .",
    "we have designed an earthquake restraint system consisting of 6 clips affixed to the mirror and the whiffle tree truss system .",
    "these are spaced approximately evenly around the circumference ( figure  [ fig : whiffle ] ) .",
    "they are made of aluminum with teflon pads positioned in normal operations with a gap ( i.e.  not touching the mirror ) .",
    "these are designed to take the static load of the mirror assembly in the event that the glue bonds fail during an earthquake .",
    "the guiding philosophy for the mirror assembly design is to provide adequate support while minimizing complexity .",
    "we started from the current m3 support - structure which utilizes 24 axial rods glued into holes that were drilled into the back surface of the glass .",
    "there is one lateral support assembly with pads along a ring that were glued to a hole drilled deep into the glass .",
    "our first efforts reduced the previous m3 support structure design to six axial rods and lateral support assembly similar to that of the current m3 .",
    "we believe this satisfied all requirements related to mirror stability .",
    "we were then encouraged to consider a design without holes drilled into the glass . with additional investigation",
    ", we determined that a six axial rod and 3 lateral rod design provides adequate support .",
    "the rod assemblies will be attached to pucks glued to the glass .",
    "the positioning of the axial rods was optimized iteratively in a series of fea models processed with ansys .",
    "the modeling and static deflection analysis was performed with traditional 3d , 20-node brick elements which yield displacements ( 3 degrees of freedom ) at the nodal locations . to obtain slopes ( rotations ) and reasonable statistics , the surface deformations of the top surface",
    "were mapped to a denser and uniform shell model .",
    "results of this second model provided the surface slopes ( and deflections ) over a uniformly distributed surface .",
    "these results were exported to excel for easy processing to obtain statistical values ( max , min , rms , etc . ) .",
    "our primary metric in evaluating a given model was the peak - to - valley ( pv ) deflections over the surface .",
    "we examined these with three orthogonal gravity vectors : one normal to the mirror surface and the other two along the directions of the major and minor axes .",
    "we implemented a mesh geometry for an ansys model of the current design .",
    "the model assumes the mirror properties described in @xmath8  [ sec : mirror ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : deform ] is a deflection contour map of displacement ( nm ) normal to the surface .",
    "the load is gravity normal to the mirror surface .",
    "this is the most severe loading condition encountered by the mirror during normal operating conditions .",
    "the peak - to - valley displacement is approximately 124 nm with an rms of 29 nm .",
    "a pseudo spot diagram shown in figure  [ fig : deform ] is an assessment of the worst - case deformations reported above . the basis for",
    "this diagram is the deformation response of the mirror due to normal gravity .",
    "surface deflections of the model ( figure  [ fig : deform ] ) are mapped to a uniform shell mesh .",
    "the plot is an aggregate of all the points on the uniform mesh .",
    "each dot on the graph represents the two out of plane rotations of the point .",
    "x slope is about the mirror major axis ; y slope is about the minor axis . for a perfectly flat mirror",
    "all points would be at the center .",
    "this shows that the rotations are small and the overall image blur is negligible .",
    "-0.1 in    within the k1 dome one may experience changes in temperature ranging from @xmath9 c to 20@xmath10 c. thermal expansion of the glass and the mirror support structure will lead to deformations in the mirror surface and its position .",
    "the design minimizes the effects of cte ( for a temperature change of 30@xmath10 c ) to about 2.4 nm peak - to - valley , 0.6 nm rms , and a maximum slope error of 0.0011arcseconds .",
    "the error budget for the mirror considered a range of conditions , as detailed below .",
    "we allow a total rms blur ( due to slopes ) in the focal plane of 7.3e-8 , @xmath11 ( slope error about major axis ) must be less than 8.42e-7 at tertiary and @xmath12 ( slope error about minor axis ) must be less than 1.19e-6 .",
    "rotations refer to the slope in the mirror surface due to deformation .",
    "the formula becomes :    @xmath13    we studied the the rms slope error for various conditions and allowances : ( i ) the support design error , based on the static response due to gravity normal to the mirror surface , which is the worst case gravity vector ; ( ii ) cte axial error , which refers to differentials in thermal expansion or contraction which would influence the mirror through adhesive and the invar pucks attached on the mirror s rear surface .",
    "( iii ) cte lateral error , which is the same effect caused by the three attached pucks on the outer edge of the mirror .",
    "( iv ) fab errors axial , which refer to a 1n load in plane load caused by the attachment of the axial support system . ( v ) fab errors lateral which is a similar assessment for the lateral support system . ( vi )",
    "moment fab errors which are based on a 0.2 n - m moment error in the respective support systems . and",
    "( vii ) axial pivot error , which considered a pivot alignment , or location , error of 1 mm .",
    "such an imbalance would result in improper reactions at the six support locations , thereby increasing surface deformations .",
    "this is based on worst case gravity acting normal to the mirror surface .",
    "the quadrature sum of these error terms is @xmath14 and is well below the maximum allowed value .",
    "we will use 3 sphere - in - groove kinematics ( 0.5 m radius spheres ) to repeatedly and precisely attach the mirror assembly to the swing arm assembly .",
    "these have a purported repeatability in position of less than 1micron and should contribute negligibly to misalignment .",
    "these couplings also have fine adjustments which will be set during alignment tests at uco ( i.e.  prior to delivery to wmko ) .",
    "a critical aspect of the mirror assembly is the gluing of the lateral and axial support pucks to the glass .",
    "the project has chosen to rely on the extensive expertise of wmko for this process .",
    "their staff has performed extensive research @xcite into adhesive selection , application , and strength performance testing which resulted in their choice of the preferred gluing agent ( hysol loctite e-120hp ) , finding that it performed well in strength tests and is substantially easier to mix and apply .",
    "it will be necessary to etch the glass with a solution produced by schott prior to gluing , which follows a rigorous cleaning and surface preparation regimen .",
    "wmko has invested heavily and developed equipment , material , and procedures for bonding invar to zerodur in preparation for their segment repair program . with their guidance and consultation we will build proof test samples to validate the design to the anticipated loads , including all fixturing , tooling , and part fabrication for the final gluing assembly .",
    "we designed the earthquake restraint system to bear the full weight of the mirror in the event that an earthquake tears the glue bonds on the axial and lateral rods .",
    "we designed for 25pounds of axial load ( equivalent to the load on an axial rod ) and the full load of the mirror",
    "laterally for each restraint .",
    "this system has a small safety factor ; the restraints may bend / deform during an earthquake and would need to be replaced afterwards .",
    "the k1dm3 system is designed to deploy and retract its mirror upon software command . in the following ,",
    "we describe the parts critical to the actuation of k1dm3 with the exception of details on the bipods and kinematic couplings that position the assembly during deployment .",
    "those are discussed in @xmath8  [ sec : upper ] .    the mirror assembly described in the previous section will fasten to a tripod swing arm fabricated with astm - a36 steel .",
    "figure  [ fig : swingarm ] illustrates the shape and overall dimensions of this part .",
    "it is a weldment of several steel members with varying diameter designed to maintain rigidity while minimizing profile . at the end points of the main arms",
    "are the kinematic couplings ( canoe spheres made by baltec , division of micro surface engineering , inc . ) that enable repeatable , precise positioning of the system . this swing arm is attached to a pivot on the top ring of the k1dm3 module .",
    "this pivot is compliant ( @xmath15 mm ) to allow the kinematic coupling to determine the deployed position of the mirror .",
    "the pivot mechanism consists of a shoulder screw that is supported by two spherical - rolling element bearings , each supported by o - rings .",

    "there are two particular requirements that the k1dm3 design must satisfy regarding vibrations and the stresses that result : ( 1 ) the stresses on the mirror must not compromise the structural integrity of the k1dm3 components .",
    "our primary concern is the glass of the mirror which has a maximum tensile strength for zerodur of 42  mpa ( 6000  psi ) with a vendor - recommended limit of 10  mpa .",

    "( 2 ) motions of the mirror must contribute less than 10%  rms to the optimal seeing disk of 0.4arcseconds .",
    "as described in @xcite , this implies less than 29 microns ( rms ) of translational motion and less than 0.65arcseconds and 0.46arcseconds ( rms ) for motions in tip and tilt respectively .",
    "we examined the predicted performance of the current k1dm3 design in a range of environments .",
    "specifically , the k1dm3 team was provided a set of forcing functions ( tables 4,5,6 of @xcite ) that are intended to describe the random motions as a function of frequency that the module would experience in three conditions : ( 1 ) during transportation ; ( 2 ) during handling at wmko ( e.g.  installation , removal for coating ) ; ( 3 ) during normal operations when installed on the telescope .",

    "the temperature of the entire telescope will change by as much as 25degrees c ( summit temperatures vary from 14deg c to @xmath17degrees c ) . given this temperature variation , it is important to consider thermal expansion effects on the alignment of the tertiary mirror .",
    "our goal has been to limit the effects from thermal expansion to be the same or less than those experienced by the current m3 system .",
    "the key to reducing the sensitivity is to pick materials with coefficients of thermal expansion that match the rest of the telescope structure .",
    "the predominant material used in the telescope structure is astm - a36 steel which has a cte of 11.7 ppm / degrees c. this material and material with very similar ctes have been selected for the k1dm3 design we estimate that there will be an approximately .12 mm change in the height of the struts for 25degrees c , but all three will move together maintaining the geometry .    with the dual actuator design , the rod must retract approximately 100 mm to change from the retracted position to deployed .",
    "the manufacturer - listed peak speed is 21 mm per second .",
    "we will actuate slower than the peak speed and allow 30 seconds to provide a smooth velocity profile for both deploy and retract .",

    "the ktl layer is a standard wmko software component that is used in every instrument at the observatory , allowing client applications to communicate with any server daemon in a uniform , standardized way .",
    "all data in a server is represented in keyword / value pairs .",
    "any client application accesses the ktl layer via ktl s standard library routines .",
    "the `` upper half '' of the ktl layer is a uniform application programming interface ( api ) used in the same way by any application , whereas the `` lower half '' of the ktl layer uses one of several different messaging methods for communicating with ktl servers .",
    "k1dm3 uses ktl / music , which uses music messaging as the transport layer .",

    "<S> motivated by the ever increasing pursuit of science with the transient sky ( dubbed time domain astronomy or tda ) , we are fabricating and will commission a new deployable tertiary mirror for the keck i telescope ( k1dm3 ) at the w.m . </S>",
    "<S> keck observatory . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents the detailed design of k1dm3 with emphasis on the opto - mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this project has presented several design challenges . </S>",
    "<S> foremost are the competing requirements to avoid vignetting the light path when retracted against a sufficiently rigid system for high - precision and repeatable pointing . </S>",
    "<S> the design utilizes an actuated swing arm to retract the mirror or deploy it into a kinematic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the k1dm3 project has also required the design and development of custom connections to provide power , communications , and compressed air to the system . </S>",
    "<S> this nsf - mri funded project is planned to be commissioned in spring 2017 . </S>"
