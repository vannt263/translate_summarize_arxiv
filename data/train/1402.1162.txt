    "for many years , it has been known that fluctuations or noise can play an important role in various effects that take place in different physical , chemical and biological systems .",
    "some examples of such effects are stochastic resonance @xcite , noise - induced transitions @xcite , and noise - induced transport , a phenomenon that has been observed in quantum @xcite and classical @xcite systems .",
    "because noise - induced effects are generally described by models where several , albeit reasonable , assumptions are made , an experimental confirmation of these surprising , sometimes counterintuitive , theoretical predictions is certainly most desirable .",
    "the verification of predicted noise effects is , in general , most easily achieved on simple experimental systems . as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , these systems should exhibit the following features : i ) their time evolution should be well known for deterministic conditions , ii ) their experimental design should not present great technical difficulties , and iii ) variables of the system and the externally introduced noise should be easily controlled . in view of these points , we immediately realize that electrical oscillator circuits are the ideal choice . indeed , the majority of the experimental studies on noise - induced phenomena has been carried out using electrical circuits @xcite . other systems where",
    "noise effects have been studied involve surface waves @xcite , spin waves in ferrites and antiferromagnets @xcite , and electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "most of the experiments mentioned above make use of systems driven by gaussian white noise .",
    "however , it has been shown that systems driven by non - gaussian noises might as well exhibit interesting features , such as shifts in the transition line for noise - induced transitions @xcite , enhancement of the signal - to - noise ratio in stochastic resonance @xcite , and enhancement of transport efficiency in brownian motors @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to experimentally investigate new non - guassian noise effects , one needs to design a system capable of producing various types of noise bearing different probability distributions .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an experimental setup that performs as a tunable environment for classical electrical oscillators .",
    "we test our scheme by implementing the case of a damped random - frequency harmonic oscillator .",
    "we have chosen this system because it represents a fundamental tool in statistical physics , which has been extensively used to describe a myriad of physical systems in different research fields @xcite .",
    "the tunability of our system is demonstrated by gradually modifying the statistics of frequency fluctuations , which is managed by properly controlling the mean and variance of the oscillator s frequency distribution .",
    "this is particularly relevant , because it implies that the system introduces directly fluctuations in the frequency of the signal , which contrasts with previous experimental studies , where fluctuations in the amplitude , rather than frequency , are introduced in the system @xcite .",
    "because of its high degree of tunability and control , this setup can readily be used to experimentally observe effects of gaussian @xcite and non - gaussian @xcite noise - induced transitions , as well as noise - induced transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "we consider a damped random - frequency harmonic oscillator whose temporal evolution reads as @xcite @xmath0}x = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the damping coefficient , @xmath2 is the average frequency of the oscillator and @xmath3 describes a stochastic gaussian process with zero average @xmath4 , and a specific autocorrelation function defined by @xmath5 , where the function @xmath6 defines the type of noise that is considered . for instance , in the case of ideal white noise , the autocorrelation function is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the intensity of the noise",

    "@xcite , the existence of frequency fluctuations in eq .",
    "( [ random_osc ] ) introduces a noise - induced additional damping and a noise - induced frequency shift to the average signal of the oscillator .",
    "the experimental setup that allows us to introduce random frequency fluctuations into a harmonic oscillator model is the following .",
    "firstly , note that one can construct a system governed by eq .",
    "( [ random_osc ] ) by making use of electrical @xmath21 oscillators ( where @xmath12 stands for resistance , @xmath11 for inductance and @xmath22 for capacitance ) . in these systems , the charge in the capacitor satisfies the same equation as eq .",
    "( [ random_osc ] ) , where the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined by @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the average capacitance of the circuit . from eq .",
    "( [ freq ] ) one can see that fluctuations in the frequency of the @xmath21 oscillator can be introduced by randomly switching the values of the capacitance @xcite .",
    "[ binom_dis ]        [ figure1 ]    random switching of capacitance is performed in the following way : an array of eight capacitors , each with equal capacitance @xmath13 , is connected in parallel to a central capacitor @xmath22 of a @xmath21 circuit . to produce uncorrelated random switching ,",
    "the individual capacitors are independently turned _ on / off _ by means of analog switches ( nxp-74hc4066n quad bilateral switch ) , which are driven by independent digital signals provided by an arbitrary function generator ( signadyne digital i / o module sd - pxe - dio - h0001 ) , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "because we are interested in designing a gaussian stochastic process , we program the arbitrary function generator , so each capacitor has the same probability to be _ on _ or _ off _ , in the same fashion as in a coin - tossing event .",
    "it is easy to show that the probability that @xmath25-capacitors in the array are _ on _ satisfies a binomial distribution given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "this distribution is defined by a mean value @xmath28 and a variance @xmath29 .",
    "notice that the binomial distribution described in eq .",
    "( [ binom ] ) is a discrete version of a gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance , as depicted in fig .",
    "it is important to remark that due to the nonlinear relation between frequency and capacitance [ eq .",
    "( [ freq ] ) ] , when calculating the probability distribution of frequency , a gaussian distribution is obtained provided that the condition @xmath30 is satisfied @xcite .      to test the proposed scheme ,",
    "we construct a @xmath21 circuit where the central capacitance @xmath22 is provided by a 1 nf ceramic capacitor , inductance @xmath11 by a 1.5 mh ferrite core inductor , and resistance @xmath12 represents parasitic losses within the system . for the random switching of capacitance",
    ", we have designed several arrays using different ceramic capacitors with capacitance value @xmath31 pf .",
    "notice from fig .",
    "2 that by changing the values of @xmath13 one can modify the variance of the gaussian distribution , which in turn modifies the statistics of the noise in the system @xcite .    to guarantee that our system is well described by eq .",
    "( [ ave_osc ] ) , we make sure that frequency fluctuations are faster than the characteristic time evolution of the system , i.e. , they satisfy the fast fluctuations condition @xcite . to this end , the digital signals from the arbitrary function generator are set with a time rate @xmath32 ns , which is longer than the response time of the analog switches ( @xmath33 ns ) , and much shorter than the temporal evolution window of the measured signal ( @xmath34s ) .",
    "[ circuit ]     +    using the system described above , we have performed the simulation of eq .",
    "( [ random_osc ] ) . to this end",
    ", we keep the capacitor @xmath22 fixed and measure the averaged signal of the oscillator connected to different capacitor arrays . figure 3(a ) shows the histograms of the measured frequency in each case .",
    "histograms are obtained from @xmath35 different realizations , and they are normalized to the maximum number of events , where we define number of events as the number of realizations that have the same value of frequency . notice that in all cases the probability distribution of the frequency follows a gaussian distribution whose variance @xmath36 depends strongly on the value of @xmath13 used in the connected array .",
    "this implies that this scheme allows to control the variance of the noise that is introduced in the system .",
    "moreover , notice that by changing the way in which capacitors are turned _",
    ", one can modify the frequency probability distribution .",
    "for instance , a dichotomous - like random frequency could be obtained by switching _ on _ and _ off _ all capacitors at the same time .    to compare the results obtained in fig .",
    "3(a ) with the theoretical model , we have measured the frequency shift that arises from the influence of frequency fluctuations , as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ ave_osc ] ) . figure 3(b )",
    "shows the frequency shift for each capacitor array .",
    "we have made use of eq .",
    "( [ ave_osc ] ) , and the relation @xcite : @xmath37 , to find that the driving noise of our system can be described by a colored - noise - like autocorrelation function of the form @xmath38 where the mean value of the frequency is computed with @xmath39 , and the variance of the driving noise is @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "this relation between both variances can be understood as a consequence of the damping term in eq .",
    "( [ random_osc ] ) .",
    "the same effect can be found , for instance , in the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , where the resulting variance is proportional to the variance of the driving noise due to the presence of a damping term @xcite .    in general , when simulating noise - induced transport effects , one is interested in keeping the mean frequency of each oscillator fixed while increasing the strength of the noise @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved in our system by controlling the values of the central capacitance @xmath22 and the time duration @xmath42 of the digital signals .",
    "figure 4 shows the frequency histograms measured with different capacitor arrays .",
    "notice that by properly controlling the parameters of the system , we are able to center all the probability distributions in the same value of frequency @xmath43 khz .",
