    "one could imagine a situation where @xmath4 is an arbitrary positive real number .",
    "this would yield a potential with a spectrum consisting of an evenly spaced ladder with a ground state energy level which may be lowered at will by the addition of an attractive dimple .",
    "such a potential , as well as being interesting from a purely mathematical point of view , may have practical application in the area of atomic bose - einstein condensation .",
    "it has been established , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that the adiabatic addition of a narrow attractive potential to a harmonic trap can lead to bose - einstein condensation at a higher critical temperature .",
    "the theoretical justification for this effect is that an additional bound state may be formed in the superposed potential , which may have energy as low as the chemical potential of the unperturbed system , leading to macroscopic occupation of that level .",
    "the problem with such a heuristic explanation is that when two potentials are superposed , one does not usually obtain a spectrum which bears any resemblance to that of either of the superposed potentials .",
    "our potential is therefore special in that the effect of adding an attractive dimple of the appropriate form has the sole effect of lowering its ground state energy .",
    "this makes it a natural starting point for future theoretical work on the dimple problem in atom traps .    in this paper",
    "we generalize our previous family of soluble potentials to allow the parameter @xmath4 to take non - integer values , and thus obtain an energy spectrum with a continuously tunable ground state .",
    "since our previous potentials were solved by noting that they are supersymmetric partner potentials of the harmonic oscillator , we proceed by determining the most general potential which is a partner of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "this leads to a two - parameter family of soluble potentials , of which the desired potentials are a subset .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a prescription for generating a two - parameter family of soluble potentials from a known soluble potential using the factorization approach . in section 3",

    "the central idea of our approach is that @xmath37 , whilst a solution of the schrdinger differential equation , does not have to be a normalizable wavefunction .",
    "there is therefore a general solution , @xmath38 , for any value of the pseudo - energy parameter , @xmath34 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two independent solutions of the schrdinger equation .",

    "the only restriction we will impose on @xmath34 and @xmath45 is that the function @xmath38 has no zeros , so that the potential @xmath23 is non - singular .",
    "this means that @xmath34 must be less than or equal to the ground state energy of @xmath20 .",
