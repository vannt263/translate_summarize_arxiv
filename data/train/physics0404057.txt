    "in solid - core photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) the air - silica microstructured cladding ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) gives rise to a variety of novel phenomena  @xcite including large - mode area ( lma ) endlessly - single mode operation @xcite .",
    "though pcfs typically have optical properties very different from that of standard fibers they of course share some of the overall properties such as the susceptibility of the attenuation to macro - bending .",
    "macrobending - induced attenuation in pcfs has been addressed both experimentally as well as theoretically / numerically in a number of papers @xcite . however , predicting bending - loss is no simple task and typically involves a full numerical solution of maxwell s equations as well as use of a phenomenological free parameter , _",
    "e.g. _ an effective core radius . in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem and show how macro - bending loss measurements on high - quality pcfs can be predicted with high accuracy using easy - to - evaluate empirical relations .",
    "predictions of macro - bending induced attenuation in photonic crystal fibers have been made using various approaches including antenna - theory for bent standard fibers @xcite , coupling - length criteria @xcite , and phenomenological models within the tilted - index representation @xcite . here",
    ", we also apply the antenna - theory of sakai and kimura  @xcite , but contrary to refs .",
    "@xcite we make a full transformation of standard - fiber parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 @xcite to fiber parameters appropriate to high - index contrast pcfs with a triangular arrangement of air holes . in the large - mode area",
    "limit we get ( see appendix )    @xmath3    for the power - decay , @xmath4 , along the fiber . for a conversion to a db - scale @xmath5 should be multiplied by @xmath6 . in eq .",
    "( [ alpha_lma ] ) , @xmath7 is the bending radius , @xmath8 is the effective area @xcite , @xmath9 is the index of silica , and @xmath10 is the recently introduced effective v - parameter of a pcf  @xcite .",
    "the strength of our formulation is that it contains no free parameters ( such as an arbitrary core radius ) and furthermore empirical expressions , depending only on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , have been given recently for both @xmath8 and @xmath13 @xcite .    from the function",
    "@xmath14 we may derive the parametric dependence of the critical bending radius @xmath15 .",
    "the function increases dramatically when the argument is less than unity and thus we may define a critical bending radius from @xmath16 where @xmath17 . typically the pcf is operated close to cut - off where @xmath18  @xcite so that the argument may be written as    @xmath19    this dependence was first reported and experimentally confirmed by birks",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite and recently a pre - factor of order unity was also found experimentally in ref .",
    "we have fabricated three lma fibers by the stack - and - pull method and characterized them using the conventional cut - back technique .",
    "all three fibers have a triangular air - hole array and a solid core formed by a single missing air - hole in the center of the structure , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    for the lma-20 macro - bending loss has been measured for bending radii of r=8 cm and r=16 cm and",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ alpha_lma ] ) are also included .",
    "it is emphasized that the predictions are based on the empirical relations for @xmath8 and @xmath13 provided in refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively and therefore do not require any numerical calculations .",
    "similar results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for the lma-25 and lma-35 fibers , respectively .",
    "the pcf , in theory , exhibits both a short and long - wavelength bend - edge .",
    "however , the results presented here only indicate a short - wavelength bend - edge .",
    "the reason for this is that the long - wavelength bend - edge occurs for @xmath20 @xcite . for typical lma - pcfs",
    "it is therefor located in the non - transparent wavelength regime of silica .",
    "in conclusion we have demonstrated that macro - bending loss measurements on high - quality pcfs can be predicted with good accuracy using easy - to - evaluate empirical relations with only @xmath21 and @xmath22 as input parameters .",
    "since macro - bending attenuation for many purposes and applications is the limiting factor we believe that the present results will be useful in practical designs of optical systems employing photonic crystal fibers .",
    "the starting point is the bending - loss formula for a gaussian mode in a standard - fiber @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath8 is the effective area , @xmath24 is the core radius , @xmath7 is the bending radius , and the standard - fiber parameters are given by @xcite @xmath25 substituting these parameters into eq .",
    "( [ alpha1 ] ) we get    @xmath26    in the relevant limit where @xmath27 . here ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 in eqs .  ( [ alpha_lma ] ) and ( [ v_pcf ] ) have been introduced . for large - mode area fibers we make a further simplification for the isolated propagation constant ; using that @xmath30 we arrive at eq .",
