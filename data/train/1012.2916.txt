    "therefore , novel cooling techniques are required to improve the performance of qubits .",
    "recently an interesting technique , microwave - driven cooling , was developed from the extensive investigations on coupled systems of the qubits and quantum resonators .",

    "this process is analogous to the optical sideband cooling , @xcite where a two - level system ( tls ) in an ion ( an `` internal '' qubit ) is used to cool ion trap potential ( an `` external '' oscillator ) , subsequently providing direct cooling to the degrees of freedom of interest . but",
    "different from the optical method , here an ancillary `` internal '' oscillator - like state is coupled to an `` internal '' qubit by a side crossover , cooling the `` internal '' qubit through microwave - driven landau - zener ( mdlz ) transitions ( or landau - zener - stckelberg interferometry ) .",

    "@xcite when a periodic strong driving is applied to the qubit , the qubit undergoes repeated lz transitions at the degeneracy point .",
    "if the driving frequency is larger than the decoherence rate , the repetition of lz transitions can induce quantum - mechanical interference , which leads to an oscillatory dependence of qubit population in the final state on the detuning from the degeneracy point and the microwave amplitude , known as landau - zener - stckelberg ( lsz ) interferometry .",

    "we also find that the frequency for optimal cooling relies on the decoherence , not always achieved at the extremely low frequency .",

    "8 ( b ) especially at the detuning near 0 m@xmath78 . without the influence of @xmath121 , the amplitude condition for optimal cooling keeps consistency at all detunings and satisfies the condition @xmath145",
    "@xmath146 m@xmath147 .",
    "because the strong decoherence enlarges the transition region near @xmath66 , the amplitude needs to be increased to longer the time in the region .    in order to compare two methods , we put them together in fig .",
    "the white solid line represents the amplitude for optimal cooling in the ordinary method , while the green dashed line represents that in the new method . actually , the green dashed line is part of the optimal region in the ordinary method with different cooling interests shown by the white dashed arrowheads .",
    "cooling interests of the green solid line have large energy spacing and hence the influence of the thermal noise is little .",
    "however the cooling interests in the new method are bothered by the temperature due to a small spacing .",
    "therefore the green dashed line produces great effects to realize lower effective temperature on the cooling interests .    at the detuning @xmath95 m@xmath68",
    "we change the amplitude and frequency to obtain the population in state @xmath6 with the new method , shown in fig .",
    "11 ( a ) . then by extracting the lowest population at each frequency in fig",
    ". 11 ( a ) , an unconventional phenomenon occurs that larger frequency yields better cooling as shown in fig .",
    "this phenomenon disobeys the frequency condition in the ordinary method , and we would discuss this result in the next section .",
    "in addition , in fig .",
    "11 ( b ) , although 5 mhz is not the frequency for optimal cooling , it also provides an effective cooling and we can still use 5 mhz for cooling in practice . moreover at each frequency the amplitude corresponding to the lowest population in state @xmath6 as shown in fig . 11 ( c ) , demonstrates that larger amplitude is needed to produce the optimal cooling at larger frequency . since larger frequency results into shorter time in the transition region , larger amplitude is needed to brings more time in the transition region over one period .",
    "however more transition region covered by the microwave indicates averagely smaller transition rate described by eq .",
    ". these two factors result into the behavior in fig .",
    "11 ( c ) .    furthermore , still at the detuning @xmath95 m@xmath68 , at different dephasing rates and frequencies we vary the amplitudes to obtain the lowest population in state @xmath6 , as illustrated in fig",
    "12 . the frequency corresponding to the optimal cooling increases as the dephasing rate increases instead of staying at 5 mhz .",
    "since the new method eliminates the disturbance of @xmath121 which conflicts with the cooling mechanism , the condition for optimal cooling here should agree with that of the experiment .",
    "this anti - intuitive result indicates there are underlying and interesting physical mechanisms .     among different amplitudes versus the dephasing rate and microwave frequency at the detuning @xmath1370.05 m@xmath68 in the new method .",

( 11 ) shows the term @xmath153 would increase the second and third term until the frequency reaches to nearly @xmath154 and in this process the total transition rate would increase .",
    "this explains why under the dephasing rate @xmath127 ghz the increase of frequency from 5 mhz to 500 mhz brings the decrease of population in state @xmath6 in fig . 11 ( b ) .",
    "as the frequency is larger than @xmath154 , this term would contribute to the decrease of the transition rate @xmath155 .",
    "therefore the frequency corresponding to the maximum of @xmath155 is relative with the decoherence rate . since here the contribution from other term in eq .",

    "13 ( a ) ] .",
    "if the dephasing rate @xmath157 is large , e. g. @xmath158 = 1 ghz , the maximum of @xmath155 would need a large frequency nearly 470 mhz , as shown in fig .",

    "the population in state @xmath6 is @xmath174where @xmath142 , and @xmath155 is defined by eq .",

    "according to the expression of @xmath175 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , larger amplitude would result the decrease of @xmath175 , which diminishes the population in state @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the final population exhibits different characters from @xmath111 .    to summarize , the decoherence modulates the frequency of the maximum of mdlz transition rate , influencing the cooling effect .",
    "although the incoherent transition region does not receive much attention in quantum information due to the loss of coherence , our studies show that the region has the particular advantage in quantum transition and quantum cooling .",
    "this decoherence induced modulation of the maximum of mdlz transition should also emerge in the ordinary cooling method as indicated in eq .",

    "therefore , nonmonotonic effect of mdlz transition can be found in the population just as shown in fig . 6 ( b ) with a frequency @xmath13 mhz corresponding to the optimal cooling .",
    "however , at the detuning @xmath95 m@xmath68 the amplitude of the maximum of @xmath111 makes the crossover @xmath121 effective.(see the inset of fig .",
    "15 ) therefore , smaller amplitude is needed and results of a final frequency 5 mhz .",
    "starting from a recent experiment , we investigate the microwave - driven cooling in an artificial atom subjected to the environment noise . under the weak decoherence",
    ", we show that the optimal cooling at each detuning depends on not only the microwave frequency but also the amplitude . at each detuning , the frequency where the optimal cooling is achieved is not always at 5 mhz , maybe slightly larger than 5 mhz . at the same time",
    ", the optimal cooling also requires that the amplitude satisfies the relation @xmath178 .",
    "we further discuss the cooling under the strong decoherence , where more vibrational degrees of freedom are coupled to the two lowest states , making the ordinary cooling method ineffective . to recover the effective cooling",
    ", we present an improved cooling method , which employs a revised driving waveform to avoid another `` harming '' side crossover .",
    "the new method can be used to effectively improve the cooling efficiency , prepare the quantum state and suppress decoherence in multi - qubit system under not only the weak decoherence but also the strong decoherence .",
    "this robustness of effective cooling under the decoherence is useful when the qubit is employed to cool neighboring quantum systems and refrigerate the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , small microwave frequency needed in the new method also provides the possibility to use our method on adiabatic quantum computation .",
    "furthermore , we show that better cooling effect is not dependent on lower frequency and the frequency for optimal cooling in both methods monotonically increases with the decoherence stronger .",
    "currently , mdlz transition in the coherent region has attracted lots of attentions due to coherent phenomena .",
    "we point out the incoherent transition region has the particular advantage in the cooling and mdlz transition with both methods .",
