    "self - organized criticality ( soc ) is a characteristic of systems that are driven by a slowly acting external force and organize themselves through energy dissipating avalanches of all sizes .",
    "although soc models were first proposed to explain the origin of the @xmath3 noise , it is recognized that it can be used to explain a large class of systems such as earthquakes  @xcite , evolutionary bursts  @xcite , forest fires  @xcite , rice piles  @xcite , financial markets  @xcite , and so on .",
    "recently we have raised the issue that , for some critical organized systems , the size of the largest avalanches can be reduced by a control intervention heuristics  @xcite .",
    "that was just a first effort to investigate if and how the damaging energy dissipative bursts in soc systems could be controlled .",
    "although such systems organize themselves without external intervention , this reorganization in a lower level of energy is very costly for society , since it depends on avalanches of all sizes .",
    "examples of these events of dissipation of energy in nature and society are avalanches that arise in snow hills , bubbles that explode in financial markets and earthquakes .",
    "although it is not possible to intervene in events such as earthquakes , in some sense we can intervene in the process that generates large snow avalanches and the explosion of stock bubbles . in the former case ,",
    "small avalanches can be triggered in order to avoid larger ones  @xcite . in the later case , central banks can in some sense enforce a monetary policy that can avoid the rising of large bubbles  @xcite .",
    "regarding this aspect , it is not the purpose of this work to defend this kind of procedure , but we surely think that it deserves to be studied .",
    "our first investigation  @xcite , was based on a replica model of the region of the system to be controlled , a control scheme was designed to externally trigger small size avalanches in order to avoid larger ones . although we have shown that this principle works for sandpiles in two - dimensional lattices  @xcite , we have no information about how far from the optimal choice these heuristics are . to fill this gap we resume our investigation with a rather different approach",
    ": we develop a dynamical programming ( dp ) approach to control the directed abelian dhar - ramaswamy ( dadr ) model in a two dimensional lattice . due to the huge number of possible states that come to play in dp approaches",
    ", any feasible investigation must be restricted to systems of much smaller size than those one usually considers when performing numerical integration of the systems .",
    "nevertheless , we can use this approach to characterize optimally the problem of controlling soc systems , as well as to explore the efficiency of other heuristics built without any kind of optimization law and as a basis for approximate optimization principles such as the ones presented in  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recent literature has used optimization principles to understand the structure and dynamics of several complex systems . in  @xcite , it was shown that complex networks may arise from optimization principles .",
    "further , analyzes of optimal navigation in complex networks  @xcite have shown that a walker that minimizes the cost of walking overlaps the random walker and the directed walker behaviors . in  @xcite optimization has been used to study the complex human dynamics of task execution .",
    "moreover , reinforcement learning has been used to explore the problem of learning paths in complex networks  @xcite .",
    "the dadr model  @xcite is built on a two - dimensional square lattice of @xmath4 sites @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "each site stores a certain amount @xmath7 of mass units . at each time step , the system is driven by two update rules : ( a ) addition rule : a mass unit is added to a randomly selected site @xmath8 , so that @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) toppling rule : if @xmath10 , then @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the model is usually represented after performing a @xmath14 rotation of the standard square lattice , in such a way the site @xmath15 lies just below the site @xmath5 , and the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions are at @xmath14 and @xmath18 angles with the horizontal axis .",
    "therefore , if deposition occurs in site @xmath5 , the only sites that may be affected are those located on the lines @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the finite set of stable states ( configurations ) in the phase space of the dadr model , and @xmath21 the number of elements of @xmath20 .",
    "as in any dp study , it is necessary to identify the different actions ( or policies ) that can be taken when the system is in any of these states .",
    "so let us note such one policy as @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 refers to the specific control action that @xmath24 undertakes when the system is in the state @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 represents the set of admissible controls , i.e. those control actions that do not violate the system dynamics .",
    "note that the number of elements in the set @xmath27 of all admissible policies @xmath24 increases faster than combinatorial when the system size increases .",
    "indeed , this number depends both on @xmath21 and on the number of possible control actions for each state @xmath25 .",
    "to control the avalanches sizes in our approach , it is important to consider that events occur according to an ordered sequence , as discussed in  @xcite . if @xmath28 is a discrete variable @xmath29 , and the dadr model is in a given `` stable '' state @xmath30 we assume that the following events take place within the time step @xmath31 .",
    "the control scheme triggers ( or not ) one avalanche in a specific site @xmath5 of the lattice .",
    "if this occurs , the avalanche starts by emptying the site @xmath5 , what amounts to topple the single unit mass with @xmath32 of probability to the site @xmath33 or to the site @xmath15 .",
    "this control induced toppling may lead to further toppling until the system reaches a new stable state @xmath34 due to the control intervention @xmath35 .",
    "after this induced avalanche , which is absent if the used policy indicates to take no action , the usual deposition process of the model takes place and the system evolves from either @xmath30 or @xmath36 to a new state @xmath37 . for this process , we only care that control intervention comes before the deposition process , and that both relaxations occur within the same time step @xmath31 .",
    "however , differently from  @xcite , we assume here that there is only possible at most one control intervention per time step , and the intervention decision is made according to a dynamic programming approach .",
    "for instance , if @xmath38 , then @xmath39",
    ". one possible state of @xmath20 is    @xmath40.\\label{aa}\\ ] ]    please note that , for the purpose of keeping a simple diagram , we did not perform the rotation used for the representation of the system described before . in such matrix - like notation ,",
    "the toppling process makes the grain move either one column to the right or one line downwards .",
    "assume @xmath41 to be @xmath30 . in this state , we have three admissible controls , namely the one that triggers no avalanche , and those that trigger an avalanche in the sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . if there is no intervention , the intermediate state @xmath44 .",
    "if an avalanche is triggered in the site @xmath42 , the system goes to @xmath34 which , with equal probabilities , is one of the states    @xmath45 , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & 0 \\\\      1 & 0 \\\\    \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]    ( if the site @xmath43 had been chosen , the situation would be quite similar but , for the sake of brevity , we will not consider this choice here . ) in order to differ one state from the other , we call the one in the left as @xmath46 and the one in the right as @xmath47 , making reference to the side followed by the controlled avalanche .",
    "thus , after the deposition process , the system can have suffered a transition to one of the following states , in the case of @xmath46 ,    @xmath48 , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & 1 \\\\      1 & 1 \\\\    \\end{array}\\right ] , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & 0 \\\\      0 & 0 \\\\    \\end{array}\\right ] , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & 0 \\\\      1 & 0 \\\\    \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]    or to one of the possible states , if @xmath47 was taken :    @xmath49 , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & 1 \\\\      1 & 0 \\\\    \\end{array}\\right ] , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & 0 \\\\      0 & 1 \\\\    \\end{array}\\right ] , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      0 & 0 \\\\      1 & 1 \\\\    \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]    therefore , with equal probabilities , the state @xmath37 will be represented by one of these eight states .",
    "one also must note that , associated with the control intervention and the deposition process , we have respectively two classes of avalanches : _ controlled avalanches _ , that are triggered by the control scheme in state @xmath30 with sizes @xmath50 or @xmath51 depending on the side that the controlled avalanche followed ; and _ uncontrolled avalanches _ with sizes @xmath52 or @xmath53 that happen when the system goes from state @xmath46 or @xmath47 to state @xmath37 due to the deposition process .    following the dp approach , we assume that the control scheme makes the decision of triggering an avalanche in one site of the system or doing nothing in a given state @xmath41 based on the minimization of the cost function    @xmath54 \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ]    where the expectation @xmath55 $ ] is conditional on the policy @xmath24 and the state @xmath41 . the cost per stage @xmath56",
    "is given by    @xmath57    where @xmath35 is the control intervention in state @xmath30 , @xmath58 is the cost of using the control @xmath59 at state @xmath30 and moving to state @xmath37 , @xmath60 is the transition probability from state @xmath30 to state @xmath37 using the control @xmath59 at state @xmath30 . in the general expression ( [ eq : g ] ) , the function form of @xmath61 has not yet made explicit . in this work ,",
    "we assume a simple particular form for @xmath61 that depends only on two parameters and a functional dependence on the avalanche size @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we write    @xmath63\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}[c_a h(s_{c , x_t\\ , x_{t}^{c , r } } ) + \\sum_{x_{t+1}}p_{x_{t}^{c , r } x_{t+1 } } c_a h(s_{u , x_{t}^{c , r}\\ , x_{t+1 } } ) ] , \\nonumber \\label{eq : gb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) is the probability of transition from @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) to @xmath37 .",
    "one must also note that , while @xmath66 indicates explicitly that the probability of the transition from state @xmath30 to state @xmath37 depends on the choice of the control @xmath59 at state @xmath30 , @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 ) does not present this dependence .",
    "@xmath69 is an indicator function that assumes the value 1 , when there is an intervention in state @xmath30 , and 0 otherwise .",
    "finally , the two parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the fixed cost associated with one intervention and avalanche size . for the sake of simplicity , we assume here that @xmath72 , i.e. , we penalize larger avalanches in a power law with exponent equal to 2 .    the term @xmath73 in ( [ eq : prob ] )",
    "weights differently the influence of the present and future costs in the decision process .",
    "although a realistic optimization process must take into account the intervention cost , it could be expected that avalanches at a given time step and those in the next future should have approximately the same weight in the decision process , what amounts to take the discount factor @xmath74 .",
    "we call the attention that this simple choice leads to a technical difficult , namely , we can not ensure that this problem has a solution that does not depend on the kind of the controlled markov process . in such situations ,",
    "the method used to solve the problem may depend on the type of the controlled markov chain that we are dealing with and may be difficult to find by simple algorithms  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the banach fixed theorem  @xcite , this difficult can be circumvented if we consider @xmath75 .",
    "finally we should also note that the choice @xmath76 is somewhat unrealistic as it does not consider the cost of the money over time .",
    "it is easy to show that the solution of problem ( [ eq : prob ] ) is given by the bellman equation  @xcite    @xmath77.\\label{bellman}\\ ] ]    in the rest of this paper , we discuss the solution of problem ( [ eq : prob ] ) using numerical solutions of the bellman equation ( [ bellman ] ) found by means of the value iteration algorithm  @xcite .",

    "we have introduced a dp approach to control soc in the dadr model .",
    "although this framework can not be applied to large system , it is quite useful to characterize the optimal solution and evaluate optimality of other heuristics .",
    "the reduction in the number of large avalanches shown in fig . 2 is similar to those obtained in  @xcite , where a fixed heuristics was considered . in that work ,",
    "no cost was associated with intervention , so that it is not possible to directly compare results predicted in fig .",
    "1a to larger systems .",
    "however , the sudden vanishing of @xmath78 at @xmath79 suggests that , for heuristic based control , a similar behavior would be observed if cost is introduced in the model .",
