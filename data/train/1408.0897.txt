    "the monte carlo simulation of lattice gauge theory is quite powerful to study nonperturbative phenomena of particle physics .",
    "however , when the action has an imaginary part like the @xmath0 term , it suffers from the numerical sign problem , failure of usual importance sampling techniques .",
    "the effect of the @xmath0 term on non - abelian gauge theory , especially quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is important , because it is related to a famous unsolved problem , `` strong cp problem '' .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on gauge theory with the @xmath0 term . in order to tackle such a problem ,",
    "another approach is desired .",
    "lattice gauge theory with the @xmath0 term shares the difficulty with finite density lattice",
    ". therefore , developing techniques to solve or by - pass the sign problem also leads to a lot of progress in the study of the qcd phase diagram at finite temperature and density .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath0 term has a non - trivial contribution to abelian gauge theory in two dimensions , also .",
    "coleman argued that the ( massive ) schwinger model , 2d qed , undergoes a phase transition at @xmath1 as @xmath2 increases where @xmath3 is the fermion mass and @xmath4 is the coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "it was followed by numerical lattice calculations and they succeeded in estimating the critical endpoint  @xcite .",
    "however , all these are based on the hamiltonian lattice gauge theory and numerical studies with the euclidean lattice gauge theory are falling behind : up to now only pure lattice gauge theory has been studied in the euclidean formulation because it is analytically solvable  @xcite . once including fermions , we have not yet established any reliable method which is effective at @xmath1 in the euclidean formulation .",
    "recently the authors have successfully applied the grassmann tensor renormalization group ( gtrg )  @xcite to the analysis on the lattice schwinger model in the euclidean formulation  @xcite .",
    "the gtrg method directly treats the grassmann numbers without relying on the pseudofermion technique employed in the hybrid monte carlo algorithm so that the computational cost is comparable to the bosonic case .",
    "another virtue is that it does not suffer from the sign problem caused by the fermion determinant . in this paper",
    ", we extend the gtrg method to the case including the @xmath0 term , where the action becomes complex , and demonstrate that it enables us to investigate the phase structure at @xmath1 .",

    "the @xmath0 vacuum is introduced as a superposition of the labeled vacua .",
    "therefore , the partition function in the @xmath0 vacuum is expressed as @xmath13}\\\\      & = \\sum_{q=-\\infty}^\\infty      \\int\\!\\mathcal{d}a^{(q)}\\,\\mathcal{d}\\bar{\\psi}\\,\\mathcal{d}\\psi\\,e^{-s[a^{(q)}]+\\frac{\\theta}{4\\pi }      \\int\\!d^2x\\,\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu}^{(q)}}\\\\      & = \\int\\!\\mathcal{d}a\\,\\mathcal{d}\\bar{\\psi}\\,\\mathcal{d}\\psi\\,e^{-s[a]+\\frac{\\theta}{4\\pi }      \\int\\!d^2x\\,\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu } } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the vacuum angle .",
    "in addition , with the use of a chiral transformation , @xmath14 the @xmath0 term is canceled by the anomaly and the mass term is modified : @xmath15    the schwinger model can be mapped to a bosonic model by using following correspondences  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a scalar field and @xmath18 is some constant which depends on the scheme employed for normal - ordering operators  @xcite .",

    "it tells us that there exists a first order phase transition at the semiclassical level . on the other hand ,",
