    "in this article using 3dimensional simple surgery techniques we first construct explicit open books on oriented circle bundles over closed oriented surfaces . then we construct open books on plumbings of circle bundles according to a graph by appropriately gluing the open books we constructed for the circle bundles involved in the plumbing .",
    "( we will use the word graph for a connected graph with at least two vertices . ) an open book on a circle bundle or more generally on a plumbing of circle bundles is called _ horizontal _ if its binding is a collection of some fibers and its pages are transverse to the fibers . here",
    "we require that the orientation induced on the binding by the pages coincides with the orientation of the fibers induced by the fibration .    we will call a plumbing graph _ non - positive _ if the sum of the degree of the vertex and the euler number of the bundle corresponding to that vertex is non - positive for every vertex of the graph .",
    "we prove that the open book we construct on a circle bundle with negative euler number or on a non - positive plumbing of circle bundles is horizontal .",
    "it turns out that the contact structure compatible with this open book is also _ horizontal _ , i.e. the contact planes ( possibly after an isotopy of the contact structure ) are transverse to the fibers .",
    "furthermore we show that the monodromy of this horizontal open book is given by a product of right - handed dehn twists along disjoint curves .",
    "consequently , by a theorem of giroux @xcite , our horizontal open book is compatible with a stein fillable contact structure .",
    "recall that eliashberg and gromov @xcite proved that every fillable contact structure is tight . as a first application of our construction we describe explicit horizontal open books on some seifert fibered 3manifolds .",
    "a contact 3manifold @xmath0 is said to be _ milnor fillable _ if it is contactomorphic to the contact boundary of an isolated complex surface singularity @xmath1 .",
    "the germ @xmath1 is called a _ milnor filling _ of @xmath0 .",
    "an analytic function @xmath2 with an isolated singularity at @xmath3 defines an open book decomposition of @xmath4 which is called a _",
    "milnor open book_. it was shown in @xcite that any milnor open book of a milnor fillable contact 3manifold @xmath0 is horizontal and compatible with the contact structure @xmath5 .",
    "we would like to point out that a milnor fillable contact structure is stein fillable and hence tight .",
    "a milnor fillable contact 3manifold is obtained as a plumbing of some circle bundles over surfaces which is topologically completely determined by the minimal good resolution of the singularity . as a second application we describe explicit open books isomorphic to milnor open books for some complex surface singularities .    on the other hand , in @xcite , using 4dimensional symplectic handle attachments , gay gives a construction of open books on plumbings of circle bundles .",
    "it turns out that the open book we construct on a given plumbing is isomorphic to gay s open book , showing in particular that the open book in his construction can be made horizontal for non - positive plumbings .",
    "if a plumbing graph is not non - positive , then there are binding components in our open book which are oriented opposite to the fiber orientation , and hence the open book fails to be horizontal .    finally we give examples of planar open books whose compatible contact structures are stein fillable and hence tight . as a consequence the weinstein conjecture holds for these tight contact structures , since the conjecture is proved for every contact structure compatible with a planar open book ( cf .",
    "planar open books compatible with some stein fillable contact structures were also constructed independently by schnenberger in his thesis @xcite , using completely different techniques .",

    "every closed oriented 3manifold admits a contact structure @xcite .",

    "moreover two contact structures carried by the same open book are isotopic .    in particular , in order",

    "the resulting 3manifold @xmath33 will be oriented extending the orientation on @xmath51 induced from @xmath29 .",
    "we use orientation preserving map rather than reversing because of our choice of orientations above .    .",
    "]    in figure  [ surgerytorus ] , we also depict a leaf ( an annulus ) of a foliation on the solid torus @xmath45 that we will glue to perform @xmath32surgery .",
    "note that @xmath45 is a trivial circle bundle over @xmath23 where the circle fibers are transverse to the annuli foliation .",
    "the boundary of a leaf consists of the core circle @xmath56 of @xmath45 and a @xmath57curve on @xmath58 , i.e. , a curve homologous to @xmath59 .",
    "each leaf is oriented so that the induced orientation on the boundary of a leaf is given as indicated in figure  [ surgerytorus ] .",
    "the gluing diffeomorphism maps @xmath60 onto @xmath49 so that by performing the @xmath32surgery we also glue each annulus in the foliation to a @xmath61 in @xmath42 identifying the outer boundary component ( i.e. , the @xmath62curve ) of the annulus with @xmath63 . hence this construction yields an open book on @xmath33 whose binding is @xmath56 ( the core circle of the surgery torus ) and pages are obtained by gluing an annulus to each @xmath61 along @xmath64 .",
    "notice that the pages will be oriented extending the orientation on @xmath61 induced from @xmath28 .",

    "next we will describe the monodromy of this open book . in order to measure the monodromy of an open book",
    "we should choose a flow which is transverse to the pages and meridional near the binding .",

    "observe that since the vector field is horizontal near the binding , the first return map of the flow generated by this vector field will fix the points near the binding on any leaf . now",
    "take a horizontal arc ( on a leaf ) connecting the core circle to the other boundary of that leaf .",
    "then one can see that the flow will move the points of this arc further to the right if we move towards the boundary .",
    "note that the first return map will fix the points on @xmath61 as well as the points near the binding . combining this discussion",
    "we conclude that the first return map is given by a right - handed dehn twist along the core circle of the leaf , which is indeed a curve parallel to the boundary of the open book .    .",
    "the vector field becomes horizontal near the core ( binding ) along any ray . ]    in summary we constructed a horizontal open book on a circle bundle over a genus @xmath65 surface @xmath28 with euler number @xmath34 by performing a @xmath32surgery on a circle fiber of a trivial circle bundle .",
    "it is clear that if we take @xmath66 disjoint fibers in @xmath67 and perform @xmath32surgery along each of these fibers , we will get a horizontal open book on a circle bundle over @xmath28 with euler number @xmath68 .",
    "the binding of the resulting open book will be the union of @xmath66 circle fibers and a page will be a genus @xmath65 surface with @xmath66 boundary components .",
    "the monodromy will be the product of right - handed dehn twists along boundary components .",
    "consequently the compatible contact structure is stein fillable ( cf .",
    "thus we get    [ hor ] there exists an explicit _ horizontal _ open book on a circle bundle with negative euler number which is compatible with a stein fillable contact structure .",
    "next we consider the contact structure compatible with our open book .",
    "[ transverse ] the contact structure compatible with the open book we constructed on a circle bundle with negative euler number is _ horizontal _ , i.e. , the contact planes ( possibly after an isotopy of the contact structure ) are positively transverse to the fibers .    by lemma 3.5 in @xcite",
    "we may assume that the contact planes are arbitrarily close to the tangents of the pages away from the binding .",
    "so clearly the contact planes are positively transverse to the fibers away from the binding since the pages of our open book are already positively transverse to the fibers .",
    "note that near a component @xmath56 of the binding we have explicitly constructed the pages , and the fibers of the circle fibration can be viewed as straight vertical lines in the solid cylinder on the left - hand side in figure  [ surgerytorus ] before we identify the top and the bottom . on the other hand , by the compatibility condition , there are coordinates @xmath69 near @xmath56 , where @xmath56 is @xmath70 and a page is given by setting @xmath71 equal to a constant such that the contact structure is given by the kernel of the form @xmath72 .",
    "curve in a neighborhood of a component @xmath56 of the binding . ]    in these new coordinates the neighborhood of @xmath56 in figure  [ surgerytorus ] is seen as in figure  [ twist ] , where the annulus is straightened out and the circle fibers are wrapped once around the cylinder in a right - handed manner .",
    "more precisely , the tangent vector to an ( oriented ) fiber is given by @xmath73 .",
    "hence one can see that the contact planes will remain positively transverse to the circle fibers in a neighborhood of @xmath56 , since @xmath74    in fact , the same argument can be generalized to prove that the contact structure compatible with any horizontal open book on a circle bundle is horizontal .",
    "any horizontal contact structure on a circle bundle is universally tight by lemma 3.9 in @xcite    1ex    note that the same construction of an open book will work when we perform @xmath34surgeries along fibers , but in that case the orientation on the binding induced by the pages will be the opposite of the fiber orientation .",
    "thus the open book we construct using @xmath34surgeries will not be horizontal",
    ". moreover we will get left - handed dehn twists along boundary components instead of right - handed dehn twists .",
    "nevertheless , by taking @xmath66 disjoint fibers in @xmath35 and performing a @xmath34surgery along each of these fibers , we will get an open book on a circle bundle over @xmath28 with euler number @xmath75 .    finally , to obtain an open book on a circle bundle with zero euler number we first observe that by performing a @xmath32surgery on a fiber and a @xmath34surgery in another fiber does not change the topology of the 3manifold which fibers over a surface .",
    "hence by performing a canceling pair of a @xmath76 surgeries on distinct fibers , we can construct an open book on a circle bundle with zero euler number with two binding components , where the monodromy is given by a right - handed dehn twists along one boundary component and a left - handed dehn twist along the other .",
    "we will construct open books for plumbings of circle bundles .",
    "we start with describing an open book on the plumbing of two circle bundles .",
    "we obtain our open book by suitably gluing the open books we constructed on the circle bundles in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath77 denote a circle bundle over a closed surface @xmath78 with euler number @xmath79 for @xmath80 . in the previous section we constructed an open book on @xmath77 .",
    "we observed that by performing a @xmath32surgery on a fiber and a @xmath34surgery in another fiber does not change the topology of the 3manifold which fibers over a surface .",
    "thus we can assume that @xmath77 is obtained from @xmath67 by @xmath81surgeries along ( disjoint fibers ) such that there are as many fibers as we wish on which we perform @xmath32surgeries .",
    "fix one of the circles where we performed a @xmath32surgery to obtain @xmath77 . consider the surgery process we described in the previous section .",
    "take a smaller solid torus neighborhood @xmath82 ( see figure  [ halfannulus ] ) of the surgery torus we glued in to perform @xmath32surgery . to obtain a plumbing of @xmath83 and @xmath84 we remove @xmath82 from @xmath77 and identify boundary tori @xmath85 , @xmath86 by an orientation reversing diffeomorphism @xmath87 taking @xmath88 to @xmath89 and @xmath90 to @xmath91 . here as in the previous section @xmath92 denote the meridian and the longitude pair for @xmath82 .",
    "note that this diffeomorphism will take @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "the point here is that when we remove @xmath82 from @xmath77 we remove a ( small ) annulus neighborhood of a binding component from every page .",
    "the remaining part of the annulus in the pages will intersect the boundary torus @xmath95 as a curve homologous to @xmath96 .",
    "hence when we plumb the circle bundles we actually glue the pages ( after removing a binding component ) of the open books on @xmath77 to obtain an open book on the plumbing . the new page will be obtained from the pages of the open books on @xmath83 and @xmath84 by gluing together one boundary component of the open book on @xmath83 with one boundary component of the open book on @xmath84 ( both of which were induced by @xmath32surgery ) .",
    "note that the glued up page will be oriented extending the orientations of the pages that we glue together .",
    "moreover the pages will be transverse to the fibers by construction .    to calculate the monodromy of the open book on the plumbed manifold we just observe that the flows we used to calculate monodromies of the open books on each piece in the plumbing will also glue together",
    ": we can assume that the flow has a constant slope @xmath38 ( given by tangents to the curves @xmath97 ) on each boundary torus so that the gluing map will take one to the other to define a flow on the closed 3-manifold obtained by plumbing .",
    "when we glue the two flows , since each flow will have the affect of moving the points on the half annuli ( see figure  [ halfannulus ] ) to the right by @xmath98-degrees we get a right - handed dehn twist along the annulus obtained by gluing the two half annuli .",
    "next we describe an explicit open book on arbitrary plumbings of circle bundles according to a weighted graph .",
    "suppose that we are given a plumbing according to a weighted graph with @xmath99 vertices such that each vertex is decorated with a pair of integers @xmath100 , where @xmath79 is the euler number and @xmath101 is the genus of the base surface @xmath78 of the @xmath102 circle bundle @xmath77 in the plumbing .",
    "let @xmath103 denote the degree of the @xmath102 vertex .",

    "to be able to plumb @xmath77 to other circle bundles @xmath103 times , we need to use @xmath103 fibers with @xmath32surgeries .",
    "so we apply extra @xmath32surgeries on @xmath103 fibers as well as @xmath34surgeries on some other @xmath103 fibers not to change the topology of @xmath77 .",
    "since we will use all the @xmath32surgeries in the plumbing process we will end up with @xmath106 fibers on which we performed @xmath34surgeries .",
    "now assume that @xmath107",
    ". then we can view @xmath77 as obtained from @xmath105 by performing @xmath32surgeries on @xmath108 distinct fibers .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath109 we perform @xmath110 extra @xmath32 and @xmath34surgeries and use all the @xmath32surgeries for the plumbing to end up with @xmath110 fibers on which we applied @xmath34surgeries .",
    "the only remaining case is @xmath111 when @xmath112 . in this case",
    "we can use @xmath103 of these @xmath32surgeries in the plumbing and we will end up with @xmath113 fibers on which we applied @xmath32surgeries .    combining all the discussion above , a page of the open book on this plumbing will be obtained by gluing together surfaces @xmath114 of genus @xmath101 with @xmath115 boundary components according to the given graph .",
    "( note , however , that we will not use these boundary components in the gluing . ) each edge in the graph will become a 1handle ( a neck ) in the page connecting the surfaces corresponding to the vertices connected by that edge .",
