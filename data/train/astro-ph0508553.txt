    "diverse cosmological observations indicate that the universe contains a significant amount of non - baryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are an attractive cdm candidate , as a stable relic from the electroweak scale generically has an interesting present day density , @xmath0 .    according to standard lore",
    "the distribution of cdm is independent of its nature ( wimps , axions , or something more exotic ) .",
    "this is true on large ( super - kpc ) scales , but may not be the case on small ( sub - pc ) scales .",
    "furthermore the signals expected in wimp detection experiments depend on the dark matter distribution .",
    "wimp direct detection experiments ( which aim to detect wimps in the lab via their elastic scattering off detector nuclei ) probe the dark matter distribution on sub - milli - pc scales .",
    "wimp indirect detection involves searching for the products ( @xmath1-rays , antiprotons and neutrinos ) of wimp annihilation and , since this is a two - body process , the event rates are proportional to the density squared and are hence enhanced by substructure .",
    "reliable predictions for the expected signals therefore require an understanding of the distribution of dark matter on small ( sub - galactic ) scales .    in cdm cosmologies structure forms hierarchically ; small halos form first with larger halos forming via mergers and accretion .",
    "the density perturbations on very small scales , and hence the properties of the first generation of structures to form , depend on the micro - physics of the cdm and the present day density distribution may retain traces of these first structures .",
    "in the early universe wimps are kept in thermal equilibrium with the radiation component via chemical interactions . as the universe expands the wimp density decreases , these interactions cease and the wimps chemically decouple or ` freeze - out ' .",
    "after this the wimp comoving number density remains constant , however wimps continue to interact kinetically , via elastic scattering , with the radiation component and are kept in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "eventually the wimp density becomes so low that elastic scattering ceases and the wimps kinetically decouple  @xcite .",
    "the average momentum exchanged per collision is small however so the relaxation timescale , which characterises the time at which wimps kinetically decouple , is significantly larger than the elastic scattering timescale  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic decoupling temperature was first estimated in ref .",

    "@xcite calculated the last scattering temperature for supersymmetric wimps . while chemical decoupling happens at a temperature @xmath2 gev ) , kinetic decoupling is delayed by the large entropy of the hot universe and takes place at a temperature @xmath3 mev ) .",
    "this is generic for any wimp that is of cosmological relevance today .",
    "elastic scattering processes around @xmath4 lead to viscous coupling of the wimp and radiation fluids , resulting in collisional damping of wimp perturbations due to bulk and shear viscosity  @xcite .",
    "the collisional damping scale was first derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by two of the present authors , and we presented a more intuitive , but less rigorous , derivation using the linearised navier - stokes equation in ref .",
    "the net result is exponential damping with a characteristic wave - number @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the wimp mass .",
    "one caveat is that our treatment is restricted to sub - horizon scales . near the horizon",
    "there are additional effects , which have recently been studied numerically by loeb and zaldarriaga  @xcite .",
    "their results confirm that the essential features of the subhorizon damping are captured by our calculation , but the additional terms play an important role in determining the precise position of the maximum of the cdm power spectrum .",
    "we agree with their conclusion that an accurate calculation ( better than @xmath7 accuracy ) must be based on a numerical computation including all of the terms .",
    "after kinetic decoupling the wimps free - stream and their distribution function is governed by the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "we study the subsequent additional damping by considering small perturbations away from the local thermal equilibrium solution , taking into account the perturbations present at kinetic decoupling .",
    "the characteristic free - streaming scale becomes constant after matter - radiation equality and is given by @xmath8 the free streaming leads to exponential damping of the wimp density contrast again but with an additional polynomial pre - factor  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath9 , the cut - off in the power spectrum is determined by the free streaming scale @xmath10 .",
    "[ wimptable ]    .benchmark wimp models . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we focus on four benchmark models which span the range of most plausible wimp properties and have present day densities in accordance with the wmap measurement of the cold dark matter density .",
    "the details of these benchmark models , including the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "@xmath13 parameterises the temperature dependence of the thermally averaged elastic scattering cross section : @xmath14 . in the standard model , elastic scattering between a light fermion and a heavy fermion is mediated by @xmath15 exchange and @xmath16 .",
    "other channels may occur however .",
    "in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , where the lightest neutralino is a wimp candidate , sfermion exchange occurs ( and if the neutralino is a gaugino , @xmath17 exchange is suppressed ) , in which case @xmath18 .",

    "the ( processed ) power spectrum depends on two more ingredients : the gravitational growth of perturbations and the primordial power spectrum .",
