    "<S> nonperturbative coupling of light with condensed matter in an optical cavity is expected to reveal a host of coherent many - body phenomena and states  @xcite . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , strong coherent light - matter interaction in a solid - state environment is of great interest to emerging quantum - based technologies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , creating a system that combines a long electronic coherence time , a large dipole moment , and a high cavity quality ( @xmath0 ) factor has been a challenging goal  @xcite . here , we report collective ultrastrong light - matter coupling in an ultrahigh - mobility two - dimensional electron gas in a high-@xmath0 terahertz photonic - crystal cavity in a quantizing magnetic field , demonstrating a cooperativity of @xmath1360 . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of cyclotron resonance ( cr ) into the lower and upper polariton branches exhibited a @xmath2-dependence on the electron density ( @xmath3 ) , a hallmark of collective vacuum rabi splitting . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a small but definite blue shift was observed for the polariton frequencies due to the normally negligible @xmath4 term in the light - matter interaction hamiltonian . finally , the high-@xmath0 cavity suppressed the superradiant decay of coherent cr , which resulted in an unprecedentedly narrow intrinsic cr linewidth of 5.6ghz at 2k . </S>",
    "<S> these results open up a variety of new possibilities to combine the traditional disciplines of many - body condensed matter physics and cavity - based quantum optics .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1        strong resonant light - matter coupling in a cavity setting is an essential ingredient in fundamental cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) studies  @xcite as well as in cavity - qed - based quantum information processing  @xcite . in particular , a variety of _ solid - state _ cavity qed systems </S>",
    "<S> have recently been examined  @xcite , not only for the purpose of developing scalable quantum technologies , but also for exploring novel many - body effects inherent to condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> for example , collective @xmath5-fold enhancement of light - matter coupling in an @xmath6-body system  @xcite , combined with colossal dipole moments available in solids , compared to traditional atomic systems , is promising for entering uncharted regimes of ultrastrong light - matter coupling . </S>",
    "<S> nonintuitive quantum phenomena can occur in such regimes , including a `` squeezed '' vacuum state  @xcite , the dicke superradiant phase transition  @xcite , the breakdown of the purcell effect  @xcite , and quantum vacuum radiation  @xcite induced by the dynamic casimir effect  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically , in a cavity qed system , there are three rates that jointly characterize different light - matter coupling regimes : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath7 is the coupling constant , with 2@xmath7 being the vacuum rabi splitting between the two normal modes , the lower polariton ( lp ) and upper polariton ( up ) , of the coupled system . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath8 is the photon decay rate of the cavity ; @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 is the photon lifetime of the cavity , and the cavity @xmath0 @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 at mode frequency @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath9 is the nonresonant matter decay rate , which is usually the decoherence rate in the case of solids . </S>",
    "<S> strong coupling is achieved when the splitting , @xmath15 , is much larger than the linewidth , ( @xmath16 , and ultrastrong coupling is achieved when @xmath7 becomes a considerable fraction of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the two standard figures of merit to measure the coupling strength are @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; here , @xmath18 is called the _ cooperativity </S>",
    "<S> _ parameter  @xcite , which is also the determining factor for the onset of optical bistability through resonant absorption saturation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in order to maximize @xmath18 and @xmath21 , one should construct a cavity qed setup that combines a large dipole moment ( i.e. , large @xmath7 ) , a small decoherence rate ( i.e. , small @xmath9 ) , a large cavity @xmath0 factor ( i.e. , small @xmath8 ) , and a small resonance frequency @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> iii - v semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) provide one of the cleanest and most tunable solid - state environments with quantum - designable optical properties . </S>",
    "<S> microcavity qw - exciton - polaritons represent a landmark realization of a strongly coupled light - condensed - matter system that exhibits a rich variety of coherent many - body phenomena  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , the large values of @xmath14 and relatively small dipole moments for interband transitions make it impractical to achieve large values of @xmath21 using exciton - polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> intraband transitions , such as intersubband transitions ( isbts )  @xcite and cyclotron resonance ( cr )  @xcite , are much better candidates for accomplishing ultrastrong coupling because of their small @xmath14 , typically in the midinfared and terahertz ( thz ) range , and their enormous dipole moments ( 10s of @xmath22- ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , ultrastrong coupling has indeed been achieved in gaas qws using isbts  @xcite and cr  @xcite . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> a record high value of @xmath21 @xmath11 0.87 has been reported  @xcite . in all these previous intraband studies of ultrastrong light - matter coupling </S>",
    "<S> , however , due to ultrafast decoherence ( large @xmath9 ) and/or lossy cavities ( large @xmath8 ) , the value of @xmath18 remained small , i.e. , the standard strong - coupling criterion ( @xmath23 ) was not satisfied .    here , we simultaneously achieved small @xmath9 and small @xmath8 in ultrahigh - mobility two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in gaas qws placed in a high-@xmath0 1d thz photonic - crystal cavity ( pcc ) in a perpendicular magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we achieved ultrastrong coupling ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) between coherent cr and thz cavity photons , observing vacuum rabi splitting ( rabi oscillations ) in the frequency ( time ) domain . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observed a @xmath2-dependence of 2@xmath7 on the electron density ( @xmath3 ) , signifying the collective nature of light - matter coupling  @xcite . a value of @xmath21 @xmath11 0.12 was obtained with just a single qw with a moderate @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the previously identified superradiant decay of cr in high - mobility 2degs  @xcite was significantly suppressed by the presence of the high-@xmath0 thz cavity . as a result , we observed ultranarrow polariton lines , yielding an intrinsic cr linewidth as small as 5.6ghz ( or a cr decay time of 57ps ) at 2k .    </S>",
    "<S> high - mobility gaas 2deg samples were studied using thz time - domain magnetospectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field quantized the density of states of the 2deg into landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> as schematically shown in fig.1**a * * , thz cavity photons are coupled with the transition between adjacent landau levels , i.e. , cr . </S>",
    "<S> figure  1**b * * shows our 1d thz pcc design , consisting of two layers of 50-@xmath26m - thick undoped si wafers on each side as a bragg mirror . thanks to the large contrast of refractive index between si ( 3.42 in the thz range ) and vacuum , only a few layers of si were required to achieve sufficient cavity confinement of thz radiation with high @xmath0 values . </S>",
    "<S> a substrate - removed 4.5-@xmath26m - thick gaas 2deg sample was placed on the central `` defect '' layer of the pcc , which was a 100-@xmath26m - thick si ( sapphire ) wafer in cavity  1 ( cavity  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> calculated electric field distribution inside cavity  1 is shown in fig.1 , * c * , * d * , and * e * , for the first , second , and third cavity modes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial overlap of the 2deg and the electric field maximum ensured the strongest light - matter coupling . </S>",
    "<S> figure  1**f * * shows a thz transmission spectrum for cavity 1 , containing a 2deg , at 4k . </S>",
    "<S> three photonic band gaps are seen as transmission stop - bands . at the center of each stop - band , a sharp cavity mode is observed . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.1 , * g * , * h * , and * i * , the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) values , or @xmath8 , of these cavity modes were 2.7ghz , 5.0ghz , and 3.8ghz , corresponding to @xmath0 factors of 150 , 243 , and 532 , respectively ; note that these numbers are slightly lower than those for an empty cavity without including the 2deg , which were 183 , 450 , and 810 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath0-factors are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for the thz metamaterial resonators employed in previous untrastrong - coupling studies using 2deg cr  @xcite . in the following , experimental data recorded with cavity  1 are shown . by varying the magnetic field ( @xmath27 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we continuously changed the detuning between the cyclotron frequency ( @xmath28 @xmath11 @xmath29 , where @xmath30 @xmath11 0.07@xmath31 is the electron effective mass of gaas and @xmath31 @xmath11 9.11 @xmath32 10@xmath33 kg ) and the cavity mode frequency ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> clear anticrossing behavior , expected for strong coupling , is shown in fig.2**a * * for the first cavity mode in cavity  1 . </S>",
    "<S> two polariton branches ( lp and up ) were formed through the hybridization of cr and the thz cavity photons . </S>",
    "<S> the central peak originates from the transmission of the cr - inactive circular - polarization component of the linearly polarized incident thz beam , which does not interact with the 2deg and whose position is independent of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhm of the central peak is thus given by @xmath8 , while that for the lp and up peaks at @xmath35 @xmath11 0 is given by @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from the @xmath35 @xmath11 0 spectrum ( @xmath37 @xmath11 1.00 t for this mode ) , we determined @xmath38 @xmath11 ( 74 , 2.6 , 5.6 , 407)ghz , yielding @xmath18 @xmath11 360 and @xmath21 @xmath11 0.09 . </S>",
    "<S> parameter values determined in this manner for all modes in both cavities 1 and 2 are summarized in table  [ parameters ] , together with cavity parameters and resonance conditions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as in other cavity qed systems based on atoms and microcavity excitons , vacuum rabi splitting in the frequency domain can be directly observed as time - domain oscillations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , for an incident thz beam linearly polarized in the @xmath39 direction , we measured the @xmath40-polarization component , @xmath41 , of the transmitted thz wave , in both positive ( @xmath42 ) and negative ( @xmath43 ) fields , and took the difference @xmath44 @xmath11 @xmath45 , to eliminate any background noise . </S>",
    "<S> the cr inactive mode was numerically filtered out . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.2**b * * , the measured @xmath35@xmath41 signal showed strong beating between the two polariton modes , which can be viewed as coherent repetitive energy exchange between the matter resonance and the cavity photons . at each beating node ( indicated by an arrow ) , energy is stored in the 2deg cr . </S>",
    "<S> the average time separation between two adjacent beating nodes was about 13 - 15ps , matching the @xmath15 splitting in the frequency domain ; see also fig.2**c * * for the fourier transform of the time - domain oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the beating lasts for dozens of picoseconds , indicating a long intrinsic cr coherence time .    in analogy to the physics of many - atom light - matter interactions  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> one crucial question is whether the rabi splitting observed here is a fully coherent behavior of a large number of individual electrons in the 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2 , * d * and * e * , show three spectra showing polariton manifestation at @xmath35 @xmath11 0 for different electron densities ( @xmath3 ) , when cr is in resonance with the first cavity mode in cavity  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum rabi splitting ( @xmath15 ) between the lp and up peaks exhibited a square - root dependence on @xmath3 ( fig.2**e * * ) , which is strong evidence for _ collective _ vacuum rabi splitting , as observed in atomic gases  @xcite and spin ensembles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation validates the notion that billions of 2d electrons are interacting with a common cavity thz photon field in a fully coherent manner . by extrapolation , </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum rabi splitting for cr of a single electron is estimated to be 0.14mhz . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that we should be able to increase the vacuum rabi splitting further by using multiple layers of a 2deg with a higher electron density .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupled system of landau - quantized 2d electrons and thz cavity photons can be described by the following hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath46 @xmath11 @xmath47 , where @xmath48 @xmath11 @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath11 @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath11 @xmath53 , and @xmath54 @xmath11 @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms , @xmath50 and @xmath48 , represent , respectively , the energy of the cavity mode at @xmath14 and the energy of the 2deg in a @xmath27 with frequency @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) are the annihilation and creation operators for cavity photons ( collective cr excitations ) , respectively . the light - matter interaction term , @xmath52 , with coupling strength @xmath7 includes counter - rotating terms , @xmath60 , which are usually neglected under the rotating - wave approximation </S>",
    "<S> . also included in the total hamiltonian is the diamagnetic term , @xmath54 , also known as the @xmath4 term because , mathematically , it is proportional to the square of the vector potential @xmath61 of the light field . </S>",
    "<S> the pre - factor @xmath62 of the @xmath4 term suggests that this term is negligible in the weak - coupling regime but can have measurable effects in the ultrastrong - coupling regime where @xmath7 is on the order of @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  3**a * * presents the best fits to our data with three different hamiltonians : i )  @xmath47 ( full hamiltonian ) , ii )  @xmath63 , and iii )  @xmath64 ( the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , @xmath65 ) . at the optimum </S>",
    "<S> fitting , the value of @xmath66 was determined to be 0.09 ( for cavity  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the full cr - cavity hamiltonian , i ) , provided the best fit , while the other two failed to show the non - negligible blue shift of the polariton modes . with @xmath66 @xmath11 0.1 , the contribution of the @xmath4 term </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be on the order of 0.01@xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this 1% contribution from the @xmath4 term indeed explains the observed blue shift , which is another manifestation of the fact that our system is in the ultrastrong - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , even the cavity mode is affected by ultrastrong coupling : as shown in fig.3**b * * , the residual cavity mode exhibits a red shift with increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected behavior occurs because the ultrastrong light - matter interaction even enables coupling between the cavity mode and the cr inactive mode at a negative frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity mode is actually part of the up branch for the cr inactive mode , as shown in fig.3**c**.    finally , we studied the extracted value of @xmath9 as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it has previously been shown that the decay of cr in free space is dominated by collective radiative decay , or superradiance , in ultrahigh - mobility 2degs , showing a decay rate that is proportional to @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this radiative decay mechanism is very strong and dominant at low temperatures , faster than any other phase breaking scattering processes ; thus , cr lines are much broader than expected from the sample mobility . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> however , the emitted coherent cr radiation can not readily escape from the high-@xmath0 cavity and thus re - excites coherent cr _ </S>",
    "<S> multiple times_. hence , this reversible emission and absorption in a strongly coupled cavity-2deg system strongly suppresses the superradiant decay , revealing the intrinsic cr decoherence rate , @xmath67 ( s@xmath68 ) @xmath11 @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this dramatic suppression of radiative decay is opposite to the purcell effect in a high-@xmath0 cavity expected in the weak - coupling regime and can only be understood within the framework of strong coupling  @xcite , where superradiant decay is suppressed by the reversible absorption and emission processes .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  4**a * * presents temperature - dependent transmission spectra at @xmath70 for the first cavity mode in cavity  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the lp and up peaks significantly broadens above 20k , becoming unobservable above 80k . </S>",
    "<S> the central peak , on the other hand , remains essentially unchanged as the temperature increases , serving as an excellent linewidth reference . at each temperature , we determined both @xmath8 and @xmath9 , using the procedure described earlier ( fig.2**a * * ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.4**b * * , the cr decay time in the cavity is 57  @xmath71ps at 2k , much longer than the superradiance - limited value in free space ( 10ps ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the cr decay time measured in our high-@xmath0 cavity is the intrinsic cr decay time , @xmath72 , due to nonradiative decay mechanisms ( i.e. , scattering ) . above 20k , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 approaches the dc momentum scattering time , @xmath73 , where piezoelectric scattering and polar optical phonon scattering dominate . at 2k </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath72 is still lower than @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> how the cr linewidth in a high - mobility 2deg changes with the magnetic field and temperature is a long - standing question  @xcite , and a systematic study of ` superradiance - free ' cr widths should provide significant new insight . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated collective and ultrastrong light - matter coupling between the cr of a 2deg and thz cavity photons in a high-@xmath0 1d photonic - crystal cavity , with a cooperativity up to 360 . unlike the near - field coupling of metamaterial resonators , our thz cavity scheme is applicable to both 2d and bulk materials , which will allow us to study various strongly correlated systems with collective many - body excitations in the thz range , e.g. , magnetically ordered systems , high - temperature superconductors , and heavy - fermion systems . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our demonstration of ultrastrong light - matter interaction in high-@xmath0 thz cavities opens a door to a plethora of new possibilities to combine the traditional disciplines of many - body condensed matter physics and quantum optics of cavity qed . </S>"
