    "the notion of @xmath0-planar - graph was introduced by ringel @xcite in the connection with problem of the simultaneous coloring of adjacent / incidence of vertices and faces of plane graphs .",

    "@xcite considered the acyclic vertex coloring of @xmath0-planar graphs and proved that each @xmath0-planar graph is acyclically @xmath18-vertex colorable .",

    "the aim of this paper is to exhibit a detailed structure of @xmath0-planar graphs which generalizes the result that every @xmath0-planar graph contains a vertex of degree at most @xmath20 in section 2 . by using this structure , we answer two questions on light graphs posed by fabrici and madaras @xcite in section 3 and give a linear upper bound of acyclic edge chromatic number of @xmath0-planar graphs in section 4 .",

    "a simple graph @xmath1 is @xmath34 if every cycle of length @xmath35 has an edge joining two nonadjacent vertices of the cycle .",
