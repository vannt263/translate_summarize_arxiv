    "ferromagnetic thin films exhibiting a magnetic domain structure in the form of thin parallel stripes have been the subject of intense research in the last few decades , both experimentallysaito , hehn , gehanno2,okamoto , buteramfm , fega and theoretically.kooy,murayama,sukstanskii,brucas,hubert this kind of structure is observed in films that present an out of plane anisotropy component ( due to stress , crystalline texture , interfacial or other effects ) and in a simplified picture it can be described as a periodic pattern of parallel in - plane magnetized regions in which the magnetization has a relatively smallcomponent that points alternatively in the two directions that are normal to the film plane .",
    "a stripe ( or bubble ) pattern is generally observed for all film thicknesses when the perpendicular anisotropy energy constant , @xmath5 is larger than the demagnetizing shape energy , @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 is the saturation magnetization ) but can also be found below a critical thickness @xmath8 when @xmath9 is smaller than one .",
    "the transition from planar to stripe domains at @xmath10 @xmath11 is due to the minimization of the total magnetic energy which can include the contribution of anisotropy , demagnetizing , domain wall and zeeman ( for @xmath12 ) terms .",
    "the critical thickness depends on the material properties such as the effective anisotropy , the saturation magnetization and the exchange stiffness constant , and also on the external field .",

    "@xmath24 the period of the stripe structure increases approximately as the square root of the film thickness , @xmath25    the study of the magnetic interactions present in films in which a crossover from a planar to a striped magnetic domain structure is observed can then give a deeper insight to understand this behavior .",

    "fept films have been fabricated by dc magnetron sputtering on naturally oxidized si ( 100 ) substrates .",
    "a detailed description of the preparation and the structural characterization can be found in ref .",
    "the samples were deposited from an fept alloy target with a nominal atomic composition of 50/50 .",
    "we sputtered eight films with thicknesses of  9 , 19 , 28 , 35 , 42 , 49 , 56 and 94 nm .",
    "the samples were studied using x - ray diffraction , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) techniques .",

    "an average crystallite grain diameter of 4 nm was obtained from tem micrographs .",

    "regimes a strong correlation between the domain configuration and the shape of the hysteresis loops was found .",
    "the dc demagnetization ( dcd ) , isothermal remanent magnetization ( irm ) and viscosity data were measured using a lakeshore model 7300 vsm , capable of a maximum field of 10000 oe . for the dcd measurements we used the following sequence of applied fields @xmath85 in this case a negative saturation field @xmath86",
    "is applied before each data point is acquired at @xmath87 after applying a field @xmath88 in most cases we set @xmath89 oe and @xmath90 oe , depending on the coercivity of the sample .",
    "a waiting time of 5 seconds was used before measuring the remanent magnetization .",
    "there is an alternative field sequence for performing dcd experiementswang @xmath91 in which the saturation field is applied only at the beginning of the experiment . in principle , this method should be less sensitive to the waiting time and the field step @xmath92 , and differences between the dcd and irm curves due to viscosity effects are minimized . in our case",
    "we did not observe significant differences between both dcd sequences and decided to use the first method .",
    "the irm curve is obtained by starting from a demagnetized state and measuring the magnetization at zero field following the sequence @xmath93the ideal demagnetized remanent state is the one obtained by heating the sample above the curie temperature , @xmath94 , and then cooling in zero field . because of the appearance of irreversible effects in the magnetic response,@xcite our films can not be heated to @xmath94 @xmath95 k , so we adopted two different protocols to demagnetize the samples .",
    "the `` linear '' demagnetization routine is the usual procedure in which the sample is saturated in one direction and a sequence of decreasing fields is applied in both senses , until zero field is reached .",
    "films can be also demagnetized in a slowly decreasing field ( from saturation to zero ) while they are quickly rotated around an axis perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the `` rotating '' demagnetization routine usually gives a remanent state that is more disordered and isotropic in the film plane than in the linear case , resembling the state that can be obtained by cooling the sample from above @xmath94 .    in the case of magnetic relaxation measurements films",
    "were saturated in a negative field of 5000 oe , a positive field was then applied and kept constant during the whole experiment while the magnetization was measured in intervals of 10 seconds during approximately 30 minutes .",
    "we calculated the viscosity from the linear fit of the time variation of @xmath14 ( eq . viscosity ) .",
    "the same routine was repeated for several fields in the vicinity of @xmath60 from which the magnetic viscosity @xmath96 is obtained .",
    "in all films we have measured the irm curves using the two demagnetizing sequences mentioned in the previous section . for films with @xmath97 nm additional care",
    "must be taken in order to reach a truly demagnetized state , because the magnetization switching at @xmath98 occurs in a very narrow field range of only a few oe . the differences between `` rotating '' and `` linear '' demagnetizing routines are more pronounced in thicker films . in fig .",
    "[ figdemag ] ( a )  we show the upper right quadrant of the hysteresis loop for the film with @xmath84 nm , together with the virgin curve obtained after demagnetizing the film using the rotating routine .",
    "it can be observed that there is a field region in which the virgin curve is not within the hysteresis loop .",
    "this effect is almost absent when the sample is demagnetized using the linear sequence and to explain it one must consider that the remanent state obtained when the sample is demagnetized using the rotating routine consists of an array of randomly oriented stripes.buteramfm on the other hand , in the case of the linear protocol almost all stripes are already aligned at remanence in the direction of the demagnetizing field .",
    "when the sample is saturated , rotational anisotropy imposes an easy magnetization axis along the field direction and the stripes are always aligned in that direction . taking into account these effects",
    "one can understand why in the linear case the virgin curve stays inside the loop , while after the rotating cycle larger fields are needed to reach the same magnetization value because part of the field energy is used in aligning the stripes in the direction of the applied field .",
    "the same differences are observed in the irm curves , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figdemag ] ( b ) . in this case",
    "starting from an initially more disordered and isotropic state ( rotating routine ) , makes more difficult the magnetization of the sample in the direction of the applied field .",
    "note that the magnetization process occurs in several steps . in the low field region ,",
    "a relatively fast initial increase of @xmath34 ( from @xmath99 to @xmath100 occurs for fields @xmath101 @xmath102 oe , for @xmath84 nm . we associate these changes to domain wall movement in the small fraction of regions which were already aligned in the direction of the applied field .",
    "then @xmath34 stays relatively constant until @xmath103 oe , which is more or less coincident with a kink in the virgin magnetization curve or the beginning of the reversible part of the @xmath104 loop .",
    "these features were assigned in ref .",
    "[ ] to the rotational anisotropy field @xmath23 , the field necessary to rotate the in - plane easy axis of the stripes in the direction of the applied field .",
    "once the stripes are aligned they can be more easily moved by the mechanism of domain wall displacement and a very large increase in @xmath34 ( from @xmath105 to @xmath106 occurs in the range @xmath107 oe .",
    "comparison with the hysteresis loop suggests that for @xmath108 oe and until @xmath109 oe irreversible changes in @xmath34 are probably due to the rotation of regions that are magnetized perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "the linearly demagnetized irm curve shows similar characteristics , but the irreversible changes at low fields ( @xmath110 ) are considerably larger , with @xmath34 reaching almost 50% of the saturation value . above this field a rapid increase and then a more gradual approach to saturation is observed , with the same overall behavior already described for the rotating routine .",
    "in the rest of the films there are still differences between both demagnetizing protocols , but they tend to disappear as the films become thinner . for @xmath111",
    "nm both irm curves are almost identical .    in fig .",
    "[ figirm - dcd ] we show the normalized dcd and irm ( starting from a rotating demagnetizing cycle ) curves for all films .",
    "we have plotted @xmath35 and @xmath112 in order to compare both measurements .",
    "the most significant feature that can be observed is that for @xmath113 nm the irm is above the dcd curve and the relationship is inverted for @xmath114 nm . as can be deduced from eq .",
    "[ deltam ] this implies a change in sign in the @xmath2 curve that is indicating a change in the dominant magnetic interactions .",
    "the fact that @xmath115 @xmath35 in the case of thinner films is telling us that in these samples the saturated state can be reached more easily , i.e. the magnetic interactions favor a magnetized state . in thicker films the irm is always below the dcd  curve , which reflects that dipolar - like interactions are dominant in these samples .    from the field where @xmath35 and @xmath112 curves cross zero",
    "we can extract the remanent coercivity @xmath45 and the irm half reversal field , @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "we will show later that the normalized difference @xmath117 may be used as a very good estimation of the sign and magnitude of the magnetic interactions .",
    "this quantity is very similar to the so - called interaction field factor , iff@xmath118 , differing only in the normalization variable . in fig .",
    "[ fighrem ] we plotted these two fields , together with the coercivity @xmath60 , and the field @xmath23 obtained from ref .",
    "this field is a measure of the average magnetic field needed to overcome the rotational anisotropy . for a stoner - wohlfarth system the two remanence fields should have the same value as @xmath119 which is relatively small for the thinner films , increases considerably when the stripe structure is formed , has a maximum at @xmath120 nm and levels off at @xmath121 oe for larger thicknesses .",
    "this behavior is approximately followed by @xmath122 although as expected @xmath123 , but is definitely not true for @xmath116 . the irmreversal field increases continuously with film thickness giving another indication of the change in the magnetic interactions when the stripe structure is formed .",
    "as already discussed in the case of the @xmath84 nm film the irm curve is a fingerprint of the field necessary for gradually aligning the domains that are not parallel to @xmath15 in the direction of the applied field .",
    "it is then expected that @xmath116 values follow closely the thickness dependence of @xmath23 , the field needed to overcome the rotational anisotropy . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fighrem ] both fields follow a similar trend , with the differences in the absolute values arising from the different remagnetizing mechanism that @xmath116 and @xmath124 describe .",
    "one of the methods to characterize qualitatively the magnetic interactions is by using the @xmath2 plots ( see eq . [ deltam ] ) , which reflect the deviations from the stoner - wohlfarth behavior .",
    "as already mentioned , if the irm is above the dcd curve the @xmath2 plot is positive and the interactions tend to be of the exchange type , favoring a magnetized state .",
    "dipolar - like interactions are more important when @xmath2 is negative . in fig .",
    "[ figdeltam ] we show the @xmath2 plots for all the studied samples as a function of the applied field ( normalized by the remanent coercivity , @xmath45 ) .",
    "we have used full symbols to indicate @xmath125 plots obtained from an irm  curve that was isotropically demagnetized ( rotational routine ) and open symbols for the case of a linearly demagnetized sample .",
    "note that there are differences between both @xmath125 curves in the case of thicker films that tend to decrease gradually as the thickness is decreased . for @xmath113",
    "nm the two curves are almost coincident .",
    "these results show again explicitly that the dominant interaction changes from magnetizing to demagnetizing when the stripe structure starts to develop at @xmath126 nm and they also give additional evidence of the effects of the rotational anisotropy on the irm remanence curves .",
    "we have already shown in figs .",
    "[ figirm - dcd ] and [ fighrem ] that the fields where the dcd and irm curves cross zero are more separated in the case of thicker films .",
    "this difference explains the shift in the minimum in the @xmath2 plots from @xmath127 to at least twice this value for @xmath84 nm .    an estimation of the strength of the magnetic interactions can be obtained from eq .",

    "even more , the activation volume seems to be rather constant for the different samples , with an average value @xmath178 nm@xmath75 which , for spherical volumes , is equivalent to an average activation diameter @xmath179 nm . for the studied samples with @xmath180 the activation diameter @xmath181 is larger than the grain size , which implies that although the predominant interactions for @xmath180 are dipolar - like , there seems to be a positive intergranular exchange coupling which contributes to the collective reversal of volumes larger than the grain size .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the interaction parameter @xmath41 is positive for @xmath82 nm , the first sample for which the stripe structure is observed , and may also explain the positive ordinate in the @xmath41 vs. @xmath182 curve of fig .",
    "note also that this value of the activation diameter is of the same order than the film thickness or the stripe half period when @xmath183 , but is much shorter than the stripe length ( which is of the order of tens of micrometers ) , implying that the magnetic volumes that reverse by thermal effects are considerably smaller than the physical volume of the stripes .",
    "our activation diameters are larger than those reported in refs .",
    "[ ] by a factor of two or more ( considering that the parameter @xmath63 appearing in eq .",
    "[ vac ] was taken as @xmath184 in those previously published papers ) .",
    "this is not surprising due to the totally different microstructure between chemically ordered and disordered samples and the larger exchange length in our magnetically soft films.@xcite .    the activation volume obtained by the procedure described above",
    "may be compared with the theoretical approach in the case of weak domain wall pinning . in this case the activation energy to overcome the barrier depends linearly@xcite on the magnetic field @xmath58@xmath185with @xmath186 the pinning field at zero temperature .",
    "since the activation volume is related to the field derivative of the activation energy , we can write@xmath187 in the last formula we have used @xmath188 and @xmath189 with this equation it is possible to calculate the activation volume if the coercive field at @xmath190 is known .",
    "we have discussed in ref . [ ] that at low temperatures there is an unexpected decrease in @xmath60 because interface stress effects hinder the formation of stripes , so that a reduction in @xmath60 occurs at low temperatures and a value for @xmath186 is not experimentally accessible .",
    "however , we can still take the maximum value of @xmath191 as a lower bound estimation for @xmath192 using the data from fig .",
    "[ fighrem ] and eq .",
    "[ vacgaunt ] we calculated @xmath193 for the set of samples with @xmath145 nm and show the results in fig .",
    "we can observe that the calculated values of @xmath177 are approximately independent of film thickness , with the exception of @xmath82 nm , a case that should be taken with extra care because a maximum in @xmath194 was not observed in the studied temperature range .",
    "this form of calculating @xmath177 gave in all cases larger values than those obtained using eq .",
    "[ vac ] , approximately by a factor of two .",
    "the difference may be due to the underestimation of @xmath186 or to an overestimation of the wall width @xmath165 .",
    "apart from this relatively small discrepancy , the observed experimental behavior is weakly dependent on film thickness , in accordance with the prediction of eq .",
    "[ vacgaunt ] .",
    "another experimental procedure for the estimation of the activation volume , which does not need the explicit measurement of @xmath159 , is the so - called `` waiting time method''.@xcite this method is based on time relaxation measurements of @xmath14 at different fields close to @xmath59 , the same curves that are used for the determination of @xmath195 the model is based on the assumption that both @xmath49 and @xmath159 are relatively constant for fields around @xmath196 when @xmath197 curves are plotted together as a function of @xmath198 it can be shown that the following relation is obeyed:@xmath199if a horizontal line of constant @xmath14 is drawn , @xmath200 represents the field distance between intersection points , and @xmath201 the time of intersection . a plot of @xmath200 as a function of @xmath202 has a slope @xmath69 from which @xmath177 can be obtained using eq .",
    "[ hf ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fighf ] we plotted the fluctuation fields obtained from the previously calculated values of @xmath177 and added the data deduced using the waiting time method .",
    "eventhough the error bars are relatively large , it can be seen that these new values of @xmath69 are of the same order of magnitude and relatively constant in the studied range of thicknesses , consistent with those previously estimated using the remanence and viscosity measurements .",
    "following ref .",
    "[ ] we have tried to correlate the values of @xmath69 with the coercivity @xmath60 .",
    "according to wohlfarth there should be a power law relationship between both parameters , @xmath203 , with @xmath204 in the range 0.5 - 1 depending on the microstructure and the type of domain wall pinning of the system .",
    "although our data points fall close to those shown in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "[ ] it was not possible to fit them using a power law due to the reduced span of the coercivity and the fluctuation field values .",
    "we have studied the role of magnetic interactions and thermally activated processes in fept alloy films as a function of film thickness .",
    "we have found that when @xmath128 is larger than the critical thickness for the formation of a structure of stripes with an antiparallel out of plane component of the magnetization the interactions tend to be dipolar - like , while for @xmath1 positive values of @xmath41 are obtained@xmath150 this change is probably due to the larger relative weight of the dipolar field present in the films with stripe domains which arrange in a flux closure configuration that tends to favor a demagnetized state . we have found that the large differences between @xmath45 and @xmath116 are mostly due to the rotational anisotropy generated when the stripe structure is present .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath41 becomes more negative with increasing thickness which again is a consequence of the predominance of magnetostatic demagnetizing effects for larger values of @xmath205 we have shown that this parameter is in close correlation with the surface demagnetizing energy , confirming that dipolar interactions are predominant above the critical thickness .",
    "magnetic viscosity was also found to depend strongly on the domain configuration . in thinner films relaxation",
    "seems to occur in discrete steps while for @xmath180 the usual logarithm behavior is found .",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath206 curves are a good estimation for the distribution of energy barriers and also have a strong variation in the field width depending on the domain structure .",
    "we finally estimated the values of the activation volumes that reverse the magnetization assisted by thermal effects and found that they are approximately independent of film thickness .",
    "the value of @xmath207 is almost an order of magnitude larger than the grain size , evidencing that a relatively large number of grains is coupled by the exchange interaction , but @xmath208 is considerably smaller than the length of the stripes ( which are several micrometers long ) , indicating that the reversal occurs in small regions compared to the size of the domains .",
    "different methods of calculating the activation volumes and the fluctuation fields yielded approximately the same results , supporting the procedure used for the estimation of these parameters .    as far as we know , this is the first time that this kind of magnetic measurements have been performed in chemically disordered fept films in which a transition in the domain structure occurs at a critical thickness . we have clearly evidenced that strong changes in most variables accompany the switch of the magnetic configuration from planar domains to parallel stripes and gave an interpretation of the observed results .    this was supported in part by conicet under grant pip 112 - 200801 - 00245 , anpcyt grant pme # 1070 , and u.n .",
