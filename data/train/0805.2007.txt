    "however , when disorder is relevant enough to interfere with the geometry of the interface , a more generic scaling can apply , and one more independent exponent is necessary to reach the dynamical description .",
    "it is the so - called anomalous scaling @xcite , and it has been observed in many different experimental and numerical situations during the last decade @xcite .",
    "several experiments of imbibition in distinct geometries have been proposed in the last years .",

    "using the same geometry , other methods of generating a disordered medium have been explored , including random variations in gap spacing produced by a predesigned surface relief of the bottom plate @xcite or by roughened plates @xcite . focusing our attention on columnar geometries we have presented in previous works @xcite experimental studies of _ forced - flow imbibition _ in a hele  shaw cell with a columnar quenched disorder , produced by dichotomic variations in the thickness of the bottom plate .",
    "we found that the interfacial dynamics followed an intrinsic anomalous scaling with varying exponents that were incompatible with the expected results from the usual macroscopic model , that gives characteristic exponents of a non local model .",
    "instead , we obtained good agreement with an heuristic model of diffusively coupled columns presenting local interactions . the essential change of behavior , which pass to be dominated by non local to local interactions , is obviously due to the persistence of the columnar disorder .",
    "however the detailed physical mechanism is not clear .    in the present paper",
    "we use numerical integrations of a phase - field model with columnar disorder to explore this behavior . by imposing the columnar geometry of the interface motion at the macroscopic model",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the physical contents of phase - field and macroscopic models as well as their relevance to explain the experimental results .",

    "the phase - field dynamics is controlled by a conserved equation based on a ginzburg - landau formulation , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the chemical potential and the free energy is given by the functional @xmath7=\\int dr [ v(\\phi ) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\epsilon \\nabla \\phi ) ^2]$ ] .",

    "the effect of an inhomogeneous capillarity is added by using a dichotomic capillary noise with the values : @xmath12 we consider a columnar disorder @xmath13 defined by single tracks of lateral size @xmath14 distributed along the @xmath15-direction in such a way that tracks with the high disorder value @xmath16 occupy 35% of the system length @xmath17 .",
    "this is the same kind of disorder reported in the experimental work of ref .",
    "note that , for a given disorder realization , tracks wider than @xmath14 are obtained when two or more unit tracks are placed adjacently .",
    "the use of phase - field models to reproduce imbibition experiments is based on the ability to get the same results than those obtained from a macroscopic model . indeed , in the so - called sharp interface limit @xmath18 , a matched asymptotic expansion of the field @xmath3 around a kink solution of eq .",

    "we can see that for high capillary contrasts ( @xmath194 ) , interface fluctuations are always described by intrinsic anomalous scaling .",
    "in addition , the dynamics of the correlation is subdiffusive , ranging from @xmath195 to @xmath196 in the highest contrast value .",

    "the velocity profiles of the interface are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmit]b .",
    "since now there is not any imposed velocity , the velocity of the interface follows the washburn s law in each channel of different noise value .",
    "+ when we increase the parameter @xmath35 a transition to a decoupled state ( @xmath197 , @xmath198 ) also appears in the case of spontaneous imbibition .",
    "however , there is an important difference with the forced - flow case .",
    "as before , we calculate the local width in a small window size @xmath193 for different capillary contrasts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wa]b ) .",
    "we observe that now , the local growth exponent @xmath192 changes suddenly to @xmath214 , indicating that the interface advances completely decoupled .",
    "the transition to the decoupled state can be now discontinuous in time for each value of the capillary contrast .",
    "it seems that there exists a length @xmath215 above which the fluctuations become decoupled .",
    "therefore , for a given value of the capillary contrast , the clusters of interface with a size @xmath216 will become decoupled between each other at the time @xmath217 , when correlation length @xmath103 reaches the length @xmath216 . above @xmath218 , the local description is not valid anymore .",
    "by means of numerical integrations of a phase - field model we find that there are strong differences between the dynamics of fluctuations in the cases of low and high capillary contrast with columnar disorder .",
    "although these differences also exist in a case of quenched noise composed of squares @xcite , they are more dramatic when the quenched noise is of columnar type .",
    "it turns out that the persistence of the noise forces the interface to adopt the same geometry , changing the nature of the interface motion .",
    "+ in a low capillary contrast case , interfaces are superrough with a dynamics dominated by surface tension with exponents @xmath156 when the velocity is nearly constant or @xmath162 when the velocity varies with washburn s law .",
    "furthermore , as interfaces are smooth and can be linearized around their mean value , a simple non local model for the interfacial evolution can be used to explain the observed dynamical scaling of fluctuations . on the other hand , when the capillary contrast is increased , interfaces are sharper and the correlation with disorder is more evident . the observed dynamical scaling corresponds then to an anomalous scaling description with a clear temporal shift at the power spectrum , and a subdiffusive behavior with dynamical exponents ranging from @xmath195 to @xmath219 , depending on the strength of capillary forces .",
    "a prominent point to remark is that this behavior can be explained by a local model made of coupled channels with a fluctuating force following darcy s law .",
    "one can interpret that in the high contrast case , the columnar disorder induces the existence of channels with more or less coupling , eliminating completely the non local character of imbibition in homogeneous geometries .",
    "finally , the difference between forced - flow and spontaneous imbibition has also been elucidated in the high capillary contrast regime .",
    "while in the forced - flow case the interface gets completely decoupled above a critical capillary contrast , in spontaneous imbibition the same decoupled state can be suddenly achieved for a given value of capillary contrast .",
