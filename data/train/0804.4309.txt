    "direct photons are produced during all stages of heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "because they do not interact strongly , they escape the medium unaffected by final state interactions and provide a promising signature of the earliest and hottest stage of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "the main sources of direct photons from a qgp are quark - gluon compton scattering ( @xmath6 ) , quark - antiquark annihilation ( @xmath7 ) and bremsstrahlung involving thermalized and incoming partons  @xcite . at rhic energies thermal photons",
    "are predicted to be the dominant source of direct photons in @xmath8  gev/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the formation of a hot and dense medium has been established by experimental results at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the measurement with the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) , based on a statistical subtraction of the expected background form hadronic sources , remains limited at low @xmath9due to large systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the knowledge of the decay background can be reduced by avoiding its explicit measurement .",
    "a tagging method has been developed in which a very pure photon sample is selected with strict photon identification cuts  @xcite . in this sample those photons are tagged , which combined with other clusters in the emc ( selected with less stringent photon identification cuts ) can be identified via their invariant mass as the result of a @xmath10decay . in the ratio of pure photons and",
    "tagged photons the reconstruction efficiency of the pure photons cancel and with it the associated systematic uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , to circumvent the limitations due to the energy resolution at low photon energies , the excellent capabilities of the phenix detector to measure electrons can be utilized by measuring photons via their external conversion into @xmath2 pairs  @xcite .",
    "these conversion pairs can be used as an alternative clean photon sample in the method described above .",
    "to overcome the statistical and systematic limitations an alternative approach has been pursued  @xcite and is outlined in the following .",
    "any process that produces a real photon can also create a virtual photon which converts internally into an @xmath2 pair .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 pairsare also produced through internal conversions of virtual direct photons , _",
    "e.g._via the @xmath11 compton scattering ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the relation between photon production and the associated @xmath2 pairproduction can be written as : @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the mass of the @xmath2 pairand @xmath15  kev/@xmath16the mass of the electron .",
    "the process dependent factor @xmath17 goes to 1 as @xmath18 or @xmath19 . for",
    "@xmath10and @xmath20 decays , @xmath17 is given by @xmath21  @xcite where @xmath22 is the hadron mass and @xmath23 the form factor .",
    "for @xmath2 pairmasses approaching @xmath22 , the factor @xmath17 goes to zero . while the measurement of real thermal photons suffers from a large background of hadron decays , measuring virtual photons allows to select a mass range , in which @xmath10decays are suppressed due to the cut - off in @xmath17 .",
    "the following analysis is based on 800 m minimum bias events collected during the @xmath3run at @xmath4= 200  gev in 2004 and 2.25  pb@xmath24 of single electron triggered data recorded during the @xmath5run at @xmath25= 200  gev in 2005 .",
    "electrons have been identified using information of the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) and a matching of momentum and the energy deposited in the emc .",
    "details of the analyses can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath2 pairsafter background subtraction is shown in fig .  [ fig : mass ] for @xmath5(left ) and @xmath3(right ) for various @xmath2 pair-@xmath9bins above 1  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the data are corrected for the electron identification efficiency based on a full monte carlo simulation , but are not corrected for the geometrical acceptance  @xcite .",
    "these data are then compared to a cocktail of hadron decays from a fast monte carlo simulation whose input is based on the measured hadron spectra  @xcite .",
    "the cocktail is normalized to the data in the mass range 030  mev/@xmath16 . while in @xmath5the agreement of the cocktail to the data",
    "is remarkable and a small excess is only observed at very high @xmath9and large mass , the @xmath3data show a large excess over the full @xmath9range of 15  gev/@xmath1 .    the observed excess above the hadronic cocktail can be analyzed under the assumption that it is solely due to internal conversions of direct virtual photons . while at zero mass @xmath2 pairsfrom hadron decays have the same shape in mass as internal conversions of direct photons , the suppression due to @xmath17 when approaching the hadron mass changes the shape of @xmath2 pairsfrom hadron decays .",
    "therefore , one can fit , after an initial normalization to the mass range 030mev/@xmath16 , the two expected shapes for @xmath2 pairsfrom hadronic decays @xmath26 ( as shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) and from direct photons @xmath27 in the mass range 80300mev/@xmath16 in which the @xmath10contribution is severely suppressed .",
    "the only fit parameter is the relative fraction of direct photons  @xmath28 : @xmath29    as an example , the fit result is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] for @xmath2 pairswith @xmath30  gev/@xmath1 in minimum bias @xmath3collisions .",
    "the quality of the fit result ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath31 for the lowest @xmath9bin ) indeed justifies the assumption that the observed excess is due to internal conversion of virtual photons .",
    "a fit with the mass shape of @xmath2 pairsfrom @xmath20 dalitz decays would lead to a two times larger @xmath20 cross section than measured  @xcite and a significantly worse @xmath32 .",
    "little contribution from other sources is expected to this kinematic region , as it is limited to @xmath33 .",
    "phenix has reported a large dielectron enhancement for @xmath34  mev/@xmath16 in  @xcite , but the dominant fraction of the enhancement is concentrated at low @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "in @xmath5 . ( b ) @xmath3(min . bias ) compared to other measurements of direct photons as described in the legend .",
    "the curves are from a nlo pqcd calculation  @xcite . ]",
    "the result is shown as @xmath35 in the left of  fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] for @xmath5collisions .",
    "it is compared to a nlo pqcd calculation of direct photons  @xcite . while the fraction of direct photons measured in @xmath5agrees well with the pqcd calculation",
    ", a clear excess is observed in minimum bias @xmath3collisions shown in the right of  fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the @xmath3result is also compared to the other measurements of direct photons at low @xmath9 ; the conventional statistical subtraction of hadronic decay photons  @xcite , the tagging method  @xcite and the external conversion analysis  @xcite .",
    "while they all agree within their uncertainties , the improvement in statistical and systematic uncertainties is quite significant .",
    "the fraction of direct photons @xmath28 can be converted into a direct photon spectrum by multiplying with the inclusive photon spectrum .",
    "the inclusive photon yield is determined for each @xmath9bin by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the yields of @xmath2 pairsin @xmath39  mev/@xmath16for data and cocktail , respectively , and @xmath40 is the yield of photons from the cocktail .",
    "the resulting direct photon spectra for @xmath5and @xmath3collisions are shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : ptspectra ] . the @xmath5data can be well described with a modified powerlaw function : @xmath41 .",
    "the direct photons measured in @xmath3are above the binary scaled fit to the @xmath5result .",
    "an exponential fit plus the binary scaled modified power law ( @xmath42 ) reveals an inverse slope of @xmath43  mev for central collisions , suggesting an excess possibly of thermal origin .",
    "the inverse slope of the direct photon spectrum can be related to the intitial temparature of the qgp  @xcite .",
