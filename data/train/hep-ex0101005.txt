    "in the past lep and slc have contributed a lot to our knowledge of particle physics . on one hand the measurements of the z - mass and couplings near the z pole and the measurement of the w mass above the w - pair threshold test the standard model at the loop level and open a window to new physics at much higher scales through virtual effects . on the other hand",
    "the large cross section at the z pole for all fermions apart from t - quarks provides a rich source for some particles like @xmath0 s , d - mesons or b - mesons that can be studies in a rather clean environment .",
    "a linear collider can potentially repeat all the measurements done at lep and slc with much higher statistics .",
    "it is therefor worth studying in which fields z - running at such a machine can still contribute in the light of the competition from new machines , namely the @xmath1 b - factories , run ii of the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the linear collider in the so called giga - z scenario should be able to provide about @xmath2 recorded z - decays . as it will be discussed later",
    "this is only useful if also a high degree of electron polarization ( @xmath3 ) is possible .",
    "in addition one needs either a very good precision on polarimetry ( @xmath4 ) or positron polarization of at least 20% .",
    "in addition to z running also running with similar luminosity at the w - pair threshold should be possible .    in the nlc design @xcite",
    "the positron source under study is independent of the electron beam .",
    "it is thus feasible to start the machine around the z - pole and upgrade it to higher energies later .",
    "the tesla design @xcite uses the high energy ( @xmath5 ) electron beam to produce the positrons by sending the beam through a wiggler or a helical undulator . to run at the z - pole one needs one part of the electron arm to produce the @xmath6 physics beam and the other part to accelerate the high energy beam for positron creation . in this design",
    "one would therefor prefer to come back to the z pole only after the basic high energy program is completed .",
    "table [ tab : lum ] shows the luminosity , beamstrahlung and depolarization for the two designs .",
    "the option with low beamstrahlung is shown for the nlc as an example , however it is possible with all designs .    .",
    "luminosity , beamstrahlung and depolarisation in the interaction point for the two designs .",
    "beamstrahlung and depolarization are given for the outgoing beam .",
    "for the interacting particles they are a factor two to four smaller . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     z counting for the @xmath7 measurement should be possible in both cases .",
    "however how much a larger z multiplicity inside an nlc train affects more complicated b - physics analyses needs detailed studies .",
    "the presently planned detectors provide excellent momentum resolution , b - tagging and hermeticity and are more or less ideal for the electroweak measurements .",
    "the excellent vertexing also helps to separate different zs within one bunch or train using the different vertex positions along the beam axis .",
    "for some analyses in b - physics a good particle identification is required .",
    "partly this can be replaced by the superb invariant mass resolution and the large magnetic field helps also to separate close - by particles to optimize the de / dx resolution .",
    "past experience has shown that specialized particle identification devices for this energy region tend to compromise the other features of the detector so that it is not clear in how far a detector optimized for b - physics at giga - z would be different from the high energy one .",
    "@xmath2 zs can be recorded in 50 to 100 days of running .",
    "since some z running is required for detector calibration in any case this can be accommodated easily within the normal schedule of the machine .",
    "if however @xmath8 zs are found a worthwhile goal , which needs several years of running , one might need a specialized interaction region and detector that can run simultaneously with the high energy experiment .",
    "with a relatively modest effort a huge gain in the precision measurements on the z - pole is possible . also the w - mass can be improved significantly if one year is spent for it .",
    "these measurements allow stringent tests of the then - standard - model . by no means",
    "the possibility to do these measurements should be excluded by the machine and detector designs .",
    "some interesting cross check in b - physics can be done with @xmath2 zs and there might be the possibility to improve on the precision from hadron machines with @xmath8 zs .",
    "however this option needs further studies and it is too early to conclude on that .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the conference for the superb organization and the pleasant atmosphere at the meeting .",
