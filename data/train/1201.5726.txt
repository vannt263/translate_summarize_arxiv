    "core collapse supernovae produce huge bursts of mev neutrinos which carry most of the gravitational energy ( @xmath2 ) of a massive star in a timescale of a few seconds .",
    "the released energy ( @xmath3  ergs ) is expected to be roughly equipartioned among the different flavors of neutrinos emerging promptly from the dense core , a few hours before the optical signal from the stellar envelope .",
    "the neutrino burst s time , flavor and energy structure carry information about the explosion mechanism @xcite and they can also be used to study vacuum and matter neutrino oscillations @xcite , the neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite or even exotic physics phenomena related to large extra dimensions and couplings to axions @xcite . since the sn1987a explosion when 24 neutrinos were detected by the kamiokande - ii , imb and baksan , many other experiments were designed @xcite to observe and study sn neutrinos .",
    "these detectors can also provide an early alarm for a sn explosion offering the chance to the astronomical community to make unprecedented observations of the early turn - on of the supernova light curve .",
    "for this purpose a supernova early warning system ( snews @xcite ) already exists providing also a trigger to detector facilities which are not able to trigger by themselves on a supernova signal .    at the time of this writing",
    ", supernova neutrinos are the only neutrinos detected beyond our solar system . however",
    ", a lot of effort has been invested in observing high energy neutrinos from galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "very large volume neutrino telescopes are designed @xcite and are already operating @xcite .",
    "such telescopes are consisting of thousands photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) and instrumented volumes of the order of km@xmath4 .",
    "neutrino interaction products , mainly muons and electrons , are detected through the cherenkov light produced in water or in ice , providing a neutrino detection energy - threshold of about 100  gev .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that bursts of low energy ( mev ) sn neutrinos are detectable in neutrino telescopes in ice , by observing a global rise of the pmts counting rates which exceeds significantly the background rate . since undersea neutrino detectors are suffering from background noise , due to the @xmath1 natural radioactivity of the sea - water , it was generally believed that only very dense detector configurations could observe sn signatures @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that deep undersea neutrino telescopes equipped with optical sensors that comprise many small pmts , are capable of detecting burst of sn neutrinos without imposing any restrictions on the detector architecture .",
    "in this study , we assume an underwater neutrino telescope following the mediterranean km3net architecture @xcite .",
    "the km3net detector will consist of several hundreds of vertical structures ( detection units - dus ) , which carry photo - sensors and devices for calibration and environmental measurements , arranged vertically on storeys .",
    "each storey will support two photo - sensors .",
    "the photo - sensor unit is a digital optical module ( dom ) consisting of a 17 inch diameter pressure resistant glass sphere , housing 31 3-inch small photomultiplier ( small - pmt ) tubes , their high - voltage bases and their interfaces to the data acquisition system with nanosecond timing precision @xcite .",
    "the segmentation of the photocathode area in such a multi - pmt dom aids in distinguishing single - photon from multi - photon hits , providing thus a better background rejection and trigger efficiency .",
    "the front - end electronics will utilize time over threshold ( tot ) measurements that carry amplitude and timing information , which allow for reconstruction of the original signal .",
    "the readout system will support the broadcasting of all the digitized data to the shore .    in this work",
    ", we studied the sn discovery potential of such a @xmath5-telescope configuration , deployed in a mediterranean site of 3500  m depth , consisting of 154 dus , with a mean horizontal separation of 180  m. each du was arranged in 20 storeys ( 6  m long bars ) , with a vertical distance between them of 40  m. each storey carries two photo - sensors , one at each end of the bar .",
    "assuming that the expected number of background events in a time interval @xmath6 is @xmath7 and that @xmath8 events have been observed in this time period , the condition that there is less than @xmath9 probability the observed events to be produced solely by the fluctuating background is : @xmath10 in case that @xmath8 is large , the above formula can be replaced by its gaussian approximation , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the excess of events with respect to the expected background .",
    "obviously , the aim of this study is to define an analysis strategy in order to maximize the following quantity : @xmath13 in the case that the excess @xmath14 is due to neutrinos from a sn explosion , it will depend on the proximity of the sn to earth , i.e.  it will be inverse proportional to the squared distance ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "consequently , the @xmath16 confidence level ( cl ) requirement in ( [ eq_m ] ) determines the maximum distance of a typical sn in order to be detected , or equivalently , given the distance of the sn , the statistical significance of the observation can be evaluated .",
    "the sn explosion model used in this work , is the so called `` garching model '' @xcite which assumes an initial star with mass of 8 - 10 solar masses , which represent 30% of all the studied sne . among the interactions of these sn neutrinos in water , inside the instrumented volume",
    ", we consider only the inverse beta decay ( ibd ) of the electron antineutrino ( @xmath0 ) which is the most dominant process .",
    "we used the ibd total cross section @xmath17 as well as the differential cross sections @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the angular difference between the positron direction and the neutrino direction ) from @xcite , which are very accurate for the energy range of sn neutrinos .",
    "the time - integrated electron antineutrino differential flux ( integrated for an observation time interval , @xmath6 , which starts with the bounce ) is expressed as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the luminosity and the energy of the antineutrino respectively , whilst @xmath23 is the distance of the sn from the earth .",
    "@xmath24 is the energy spectrum of the electron antineutrino as parametrized in @xcite , where @xmath25 is the mean energy of the neutrino and @xmath26 a parameter representing the amount of spectral pinching .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath21 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by the garching model .",
    "the integration time @xmath6 is chosen as in @xcite in order to maximize the discovery potential for sn detection ( i.e.  eq .  ( [ eq_dp ] ) ) and it is found to be @xmath27 , using the time structure of the neutrino burst predicted by the garching model .",
    "the positron emitted in sn neutrino induced ibd process is sufficiently energetic ( mean energy 17.19  mev ) to produce cherenkov radiation in the sea water , which is detectable by the photo - sensors of a neutrino telescope .",
    "the response of the detector to the ibd positrons and background processes is simulated by utilizing the hours @xcite package ( hellenic open university reconstruction and simulation package ) , which describes in detail all the relevant physical processes ( e.g.  secondary interactions , propagation of cherenkov photons ) , the response of the pmts and the digitization electronics . using the simulated events we evaluated the effective volume , @xmath28 , for ibd interactions and the interaction density , @xmath29 , which expresses the number of ibd neutrino interactions per unit volume , occurring inside an observation time interval @xmath6 , caused by the explosion of a sn at distance @xmath23 .",
    "the effective volume is estimated as the water volume , around a dom , in which we have simulated ibd positron production , weighted by the fraction of the interactions observed by the dom , under certain observation criteria .",
    "the interaction density is found by estimating the integral , @xmath30 by monte carlo integration , where @xmath31 is the free proton density in sea water at the detector deployment depth and the cross sections are taken as described in section 4 . as an example , for a sn explosion at a distance of @xmath32 and for @xmath27 the interaction density at a depth of 3500  m is estimated to be @xmath33 .",
    "finally the expected number of observed ibd interactions , from a sn explosion at a distance @xmath23 is evaluated as , @xmath34    , as a function of the pmt multiplicity for three type of events : @xmath1 decays , atmospheric muons and sn neutrinos .",
    "the sn explosion is assumed to occur at a distance of 10  kpc and the @xmath5-telescope is assumed to be deployed at a depth of 3500  m containing 6160 doms.,width=377 ]    as already mentioned , the main background source to sn neutrinos is the natural radioactivity of @xmath1 in the sea water .",
    "the @xmath1 decay rate is about @xmath35 , five orders of magnitude greater than the expected ibd rate from a sn at 10  kpc .",
    "however , the released @xmath1 decay energy is relatively small with respect to the energy of the sn neutrino induced ibd positron .",
    "the effective volume corresponding to the @xmath1 decays , is thus much smaller than the effective volume for sn neutrino ibd interactions .",
    "furthermore the products of @xmath1 decays have less probability to activate synchronously several small pmts of the same dom .",
    "we define thus , as the main observation criterion , the pmt multiplicity , which is the number of pmts in the same dom that are simultaneously active within a coincidence time window of 100  ns . fig .",
    "[ fig_events ] presents the total number of active doms due to @xmath1 decays , collected during an observation time interval of @xmath27 , as a function of the pmt multiplicity , in comparison with the corresponding number due to sn neutrino induced ibds , assuming that the sn explosion occurred at a distance of 10  kpc .",
    "although the background due to @xmath1 decays is significantly reduced at high pmt multiplicities , it is expected that atmospheric muons will still contribute to the background up to very high pmt multiplicities , due to the causal connection between hits produced by muons . in order to quantify this muonic background",
    "we have used hours with generation input from the mupage package @xcite with an energy threshold as low as 50  gev .",
    "the contribution of this type of background is also shown as a function of the pmt multiplicity in fig .",

    "as shown in fig .  [ fig_events ] , a high pmt multiplicity rejects the @xmath1 background .",
    "a further suppression of this background can be achieved when we apply selection criteria , based on the amplitude of the small - pmt signals .",
    "[ fig_cuts ] ( a , b and c ) shows the probability of a dom , activated by a @xmath1 decay or sn neutrino induced ibd , to exhibit a certain pmt multiplicity , for three different small - pmt pulse - amplitude thresholds , @xmath39 . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig_cuts](a ) a small pmt is considered active when its pulse amplitude exceeds an amplitude - threshold corresponding to the average pulse amplitude produced by one photoelectron ( pe ) , @xmath40 .",
    "the probability of the @xmath1 background to produce high pmt multiplicity events decreases faster than the signal , as the threshold requirement is getting higher .",
    "however we found that this requirement has not any significant effect on the background produced by atmospheric muons . on the other hand , it is very improbable that the @xmath1 background and the sn neutrino induced ibds will activate small pmts in different doms ( especially when high pmt multiplicity is required ) . on the contrary ,",
    "muon tracks produce very often time - correlated hits in different doms , with high pmt multiplicity .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
