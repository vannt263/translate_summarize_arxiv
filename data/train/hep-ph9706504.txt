    "following the initial suggestion by matsui and satz @xcite , the na50 experimental observation @xcite of a possible discontinuity in the absorption of @xmath0 in pb - pb collisions has led to a flurry of theoretical activities .",
    "while the present author and others presented theoretical findings at the quark matter meeting in 1996 @xcite , other theoretical studies have since been put forth @xcite .",
    "a central question is whether the anomalous suppression in pb - pb collisions arises from the occurrence of a new phase of strong @xmath0 absorbing matter ( possibly a quark - gluon plasma ) , as suggested in @xcite , or from the absorption by comovers ( produced hadrons ) , as proposed by @xcite .    to shed light on this question",
    ", we shall examine the absorption mechanisms both qualitatively and quantitatively and study how different mechanisms can be recognized by their characteristic signatures . from these studies ,",
    "the deviation of the @xmath0 data in pb - pb collisions from the results extrapolated from @xmath2 , o - cu , o - u , and s - u collisions suggests that there is a new absorption mechanism which results in the anomalous suppression of @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions .    while the debate on the theoretical interpretation of the experimental data continues",
    ", it is useful to look for other effects of a quark - gluon plasma so as to provide means for its search and identification .",
    "we shall examine a possible signature which allows one to study the chemical content of the quark - gluon plasma , if it is ever produced .",
    "-0.1 cm in a nucleon - nucleon collision , @xmath4 pairs are produced by the collision of a parton of one nucleon with a parton of another nucleon . among the @xmath4 pairs , those @xmath4 pairs with large relative energies",
    "will separate into @xmath5 pairs and will not be the subject of our attention . only those with low invariant masses will have a high probability to evolve into precursors of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these precursors can be in a color - singlet or color - octet state @xcite .",
    "with respect to a nucleon , a precursor in a color - octet state has a total cross section of a few tens of millibarns , which is much greater than that in a color - singlet state @xcite . if the precursor is produced as an incoherent mixture of the two color states , then the survival probability for the precursor will be the sum of two different exponential survival probabilities with two characteristic absorption lengths . in principle",
    ", the color - octet production fraction can be inferred from the absorption curve in @xmath2 collisions as a function of the atomic number @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , the sparsity of the data points and the uncertainty of the experimental measurements do not allow a clean separation of the two color fractions .",
    "the analysis of experimental data suggests that na3 @xcite , na38 @xcite , and e772 @xcite data are not inconsistent with the theoretical picture @xcite that color - octet and color - singlet precursors are produced in roughly equal proportions if the produced color - singlet precursors are pointlike and transparent . however ,",
    "if the color - singlet precursors are not transparent but have a cross section of a few mb , these data do show a definite preference for a larger fraction of color - singlet precursors @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we shall limit our attention to a single effective color component for our discussions .",
    "a very important property of a precursor is the energy needed to separate it into a @xmath5 pair .",
    "a color - singlet @xmath0 particle needs an energy of 640 mev to break into a @xmath5 pair , while a @xmath7 needs about 200 mev , and a @xmath1 only about 50 mev .",
    "a color - octet precursor will need to emit or absorb a soft gluon in the time scale of nonperturbative qcd to neutralize into a color - singlet state .",
    "if it is broken up into a @xmath5 pair , one of the pair will be in a color - octet state , and the need to emit or absorb a soft gluon remains unchanged .",
    "thus , the average energy required to break a color - octet @xmath0 precursor is still about 640 mev and a color - octet @xmath1 precursor about 50 mev , but with a large standard deviation ( of about a few hundred mev ) , due to the emission or absorption of the soft gluon . for simplicity",
    ", we shall group @xmath8 particles with the @xmath0 because of the large energies required to break them into @xmath5 pairs .",
    "we consider the collision of a projectile nucleus @xmath9 with a target nucleus @xmath6 leading to the production of a @xmath0 or @xmath1 precursor , depicted by the big dot at @xmath10 in fig .",
    "the precursor will collide with two groups of particles at different energies : the projectile and target nucleons and the produced soft particles .",
    "the dynamics of precursor - particle collisions is best studied in the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass frame illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath11 is the lorentz contraction factor . in this frame",
    ", the nucleons still retain a large fraction of their initial kinetic energies . as @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are produced predominantly at central rapidity , the precursors can be envisaged as produced nearly at rest .",
    "collisions between the nucleons and the precursor take place at high energies , much higher than the -1.3 cm = -16 = -3 in separation thresholds of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 precursor , and likely lead to the breakup of the precursor into a @xmath5 pair .",
    "absorption due to collisions with nucleons can be called the hard component .",
    "the precursor survival probability , after colliding with projectile and target nucleons , is @xmath12-@xmath13 for @xmath0 and is @xmath14-@xmath13 for @xmath1 , where @xmath15 is the sum of the path length @xmath16 in the projectile and @xmath17 in the target nucleus in their respective rest frames , @xmath18 is the nucleon density at rest , and @xmath19-@xmath20 and @xmath21-@xmath20 are respectively the @xmath0-@xmath22 and @xmath1-@xmath22 absorption cross section @xcite .    1.0 cm    -2.8 cm 8.4 cm    * fig.1 .",

    "however , in nucleus - nucleus collisions , there is an additional absorption component .",
    "there , a @xmath0 or @xmath1 precursor produced at @xmath10 in fig .",
    "1 finds itself in the middle of fireballs of soft particles produced by earlier or later nucleon - nucleon collisions centered at the same spatial location ( soft particles depicted by the small dots around the point @xmath10 in fig .",
    "1 ) . these produced soft particles may exist in the form of virtual gluons in early stages and hadrons at later stages @xcite .",
    "they will collide with the @xmath0 or @xmath1 precursor and lead to its breakup .",
    "the centers of the fireballs of produced soft particles are nearly at rest , and the collisions between the precursor and the soft particles of the fireballs occur at a kinetic energy which is about twice the fireball temperature ( of a few hundred mev )",
    ". absorption due to these collisions can be called the soft component of @xmath0 and @xmath1 absorption .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 due to the absorption by soft particle collisions is approximately an exponential function whose exponent is proportional to the ( precursor)-(soft particle ) absorption cross section and the density of soft particles in which the precursor finds itself .",
    "the number of produced soft particles depends on the number of participants @xcite .",
    "the number of participants in turn is proportional to the longitudinal path length passing through nuclei @xmath6 and @xmath9 . because of such dependence on participant numbers and the longitudinal path length , the survival probability due to",
    "soft particle absorption is approximately @xmath23-(soft particle))@xmath24 , where @xmath25 is approximately a constant ( see pages 374 - 377 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from these considerations , we can separate out the two components of absorption by plotting the logarithm of the survival probability as a function of the path length . following the work of gerschel and h \" ufner@xcite ,",
    "the hard component can be separated out by the @xmath2 line , and the precursor - nucleon cross section at high energies can be measured by the slopes of the @xmath2 lines . in addition , the effect of the soft component can be uncovered by the gap and the change of the slope going from the @xmath2 line to the @xmath26 lines .",
    "the magnitude of the gap and the change of the slope are not independent .",
    "a large gap is accompanied by a large slope change .",
    "they are related to the magnitude of the ( precursor)-(soft particle ) cross section at low energies .",
    "we expect that because the collision energy in the soft absorption component is small compared to the separation threshold of 640 mev for @xmath0 but large compared to the separation threshold of 50 mev for @xmath1 , the absorption behavior for @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be quite different for the soft component .",
    "we can use the qualitative signatures discussed in the last section to examine the experimental @xmath0 and @xmath1 data in two different ways .",
    "we look first at experimental @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections for @xmath26 collisions when all impact parameters are summed over .",
    "if there were no absorption , these cross sections would be proportional to the product @xmath26 .",
    "the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are branching constants ) give respectively the @xmath0 and @xmath1 survival probabilities , multiplied by constants . in figs .",
    "1@xmath31 and @xmath32 , these quantities are presented in a semi - log plot as a function of @xmath33 , which is proportional to the path length averaged over all impact parameters @xcite . here , the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 are proportional to the radii of the two nuclei , and the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are included to take into account the finiteness of the number of nucleons .",

    "4truemm    we look next at a different set of data where one uses the information on the transverse energy to select the effective impact parameter .",
    "this allows one to study the survival probability as a function of the impact parameter and its associated average path length @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross section in the absence of absorption is proportional to the drell - yan cross section .",
    "because the drell - yan cross section does not suffer much absorption in nuclear and hadron environments , the ratios of @xmath42 and @xmath43 to the drell - yan cross section are good representations of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 survival probabilities , multiplied by constants",
    ". these ratios as a function of the path length @xmath15 are presented for @xmath0 in fig .",

    "the slopes of the @xmath2 lines for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are nearly the same . therefore for the hard component of the absorption process , the rate of absorption and the associated absorption cross sections by collisions with nucleons at high energies are approximately the same for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the approximate equality is supported by other experimental data of @xmath44-@xmath45-@xmath46 inferred from the photoproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "data are from na51 @xcite , na38 @xcite , and na50 @xcite . *    4truemm    theoretically",
    ", the approximate equality of @xmath49-@xmath50-@xmath20 can be explained by the glauber picture of hadron - hadron collisions in terms of quark - quark collisions as a generalization of the additive quark model at high energies , for which the absorption cross section for @xmath51-@xmath22 collisions and @xmath1-@xmath22 collisions can be shown to be insensitive to the separation between @xmath25 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the approximate equality leads immediately to the experimental observation of the independence of @xmath53 with mass numbers in @xmath54-a collisions @xcite .",
    "other , different theoretical models interpret the approximate equality as arising from the same separation between the color - octet @xmath55 and a gluon in the hybrid @xmath55-@xmath56 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production @xcite , or a coherent @xmath0-@xmath1 admixture @xcite .",
    "as hadron - hadron cross sections involve nonperturbative aspects of qcd dynamics , much more work remains to be done to clarify the origin of this approximate equality .    to study the soft component of absorption , one looks for a gap and a change of the slope in going from the @xmath2 line to the @xmath26 line .",
    "from the @xmath1 data in fig . 1@xmath39 , one can discern the presence of a gap in going from the @xmath2 line to the s - u data point .",
    "the @xmath1 data in fig .",
    "2@xmath39 show a big gap and a large change of the slope in going from the @xmath2 line to the @xmath26 line , conforming to the signature of the soft component .",
    "figs .  1@xmath39 and 2@xmath39 indicate that for @xmath1 production , the absorption due to the soft component is large .",
    "the above analysis of the @xmath1 data provides us with a clear signature of the soft absorption component .",
    "this signature can be used to identify the soft component in other production processes . upon searching for the signature of the soft absorption component in @xmath0 production data for @xmath2 , o - cu , o - s , and s - u collisions in figs .",
    "1@xmath31 and 2@xmath31 , one finds that there is almost no gap and no change of the slope in going from the @xmath2 line to the @xmath26 line .",
    "one concludes that the absorption of @xmath0 by soft particles , as revealed by the data of @xmath2 , o - cu , o - u , and s - u , is small .",
    "the difference in the behavior of the @xmath0 precursor and @xmath1 precursor with regard to absorption by soft particles can be easily understood as due to their difference in the threshold energies mentioned above .",
    "the average relative kinetic energies between the soft particles and the precursor are much below the @xmath0 threshold but much above the @xmath1 threshold , and thus the rate of absorption of @xmath0 by soft particle collisions is small compared with the rate of absorption of @xmath1 by soft particle collisions .",
    "when one extends one s consideration to pb - pb collisions , one finds that the @xmath26 line of o - cu , o - u , and s - u in figs .",
    "1@xmath31 and 2@xmath31 are much above the pb - pb data points .",
    "this indicates that the degree of @xmath0 absorption by soft particles , as revealed by the data of o - cu , o - u , and s - u collisions , can not explain the pb - pb data , and a new phase of strong @xmath0 absorption in pb - pb collisions is suggested .",
    "we use this microscopic absorption model to study the experimental data ( see also @xcite ) . consider first the @xmath0 data in @xmath2 , o - cu , o - u and s - u collisions . if one assumes that there is no soft particle absorption , the results with the least @xmath93 are obtained with @xmath72-@xmath94 mb , shown as dotted curves in fig . 1@xmath31 and 2@xmath39 .",

    "the flattening of the theoretical ratio of @xmath102 as a function of @xmath15 for s - u collisions in fig .",
    "2@xmath39 arises because the distribution of soft particle densities in the central region of @xmath1 production is insensitive to the impact parameter for small impact parameters when the masses of the two colliding nuclei are very different .",
    "nuclear deformation may play a role in leading to a greater density of soft particles for collisions with the largest transverse energies and may lead to the discrepancy of the theoretical results with experimental data for those s - u collisions with the largest transverse energies ( or the largest apparent path lengths in fig .",
    "2@xmath39 ) .",
    "the comparison of s - pb and s - u collisions will shed light on the deformation effect .",
    "the deviation of the @xmath0 data in pb - pb collisions from the conventional theoretical extrapolations in @xmath54-a , o - a , and s - u collisions suggests that there is a transition to a new phase of strong absorption , which sets in when the local energy density exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "we can extend the absorption model to describe this transition .",
    "the energy density at a particular spatial point at a given time is approximately proportional to the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions which has taken place at that spatial point up to that time .",
    "we use the row - on - row picture as before , and postulate that soft particles make a transition to a new phase with stronger @xmath0 absorption characteristics at a spatial point if there have been @xmath103 or more baryon - baryon collisions at that spatial point . the quantity @xmath104 in eq .",

    "baryons passing through the spatial region of the new phase may also become deconfined to alter their @xmath0 absorption characteristics .",
    "accordingly we also vary the effective absorption cross section , @xmath108 , for @xmath51-@xmath22 interactions in the row in which there is a transition to the new phase , while the absorption cross section @xmath109 remains unchanged in other rows where there is no transition . as shown on the curves marked by `` with new phase '' in figs .",

    "theoretical results obtained by assuming the new phase are shown as the curves marked by `` with new phase '' in fig . 1@xmath39 and the lower solid curves in fig .",
    "they indicate that as far as @xmath1 suppression is concerned , the @xmath1 particles are so strongly absorbed by collisions with soft particles that the presence of an additional source of absorption leads only to a very small additional absorption . seen in this light",
    ", @xmath0 is a better probe for a new phase of absorption than @xmath1 because of its large threshold value which does not allow it to be destroyed in great proportion by soft particles .",
    "we have seen that the anomalous suppression of @xmath0 in pb - pb collisions can be explained by models in which a new phase of strong absorption sets in when the number of baryon - baryon collisions at a local point exceeds or is equal to @xmath1154 .",
    "we can inquire about the approximate threshold energy density @xmath116 which corresponds to the onset of the new phase .",
    "evaluated in the nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass system , the energy density at the spatial point , which has had @xmath103 prior nucleon - nucleon collisions , is approximately @xmath117 where @xmath118 @xcite is the particle multiplicity per unit of rapidity at @xmath119 for an @xmath76 fixed - target collision at 158a gev , @xmath120 gev is the transverse mass of a produced pion , @xmath121 fm is the internucleon spacing , and @xmath122 is the lorentz contraction factor . for @xmath111",

    "application of these signatures to examine the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data indicates that the degree of absorption by soft particles on @xmath0 production , as revealed by the o - cu , o - u , and s - u data , is small .",
    "the absorption by soft particles on @xmath1 production is however quite large .",
    "a microscopic absorption model which takes care of all precursor sources and absorbers is used to examine these two mechanisms .",
    "the microscopic model results support the above qualitative descriptions .",
    "when one extends one s consideration to pb - pb collisions , one finds that the degree of @xmath0 absorption by soft particles as constrained by the data of o - cu , o - u , and s - u collisions can not explain the pb - pb data , and a new phase of strong @xmath0 absorption in pb - pb collisions is suggested .",
    "the anomalous suppression of @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions can be explained as due to the occurrence of a new phase of strong @xmath0 absorption , which sets in when the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions at a spatial point exceeds about 4 and corresponds to a local energy density of about 3.4 gev/@xmath3 .    in order to demonstrate that the anomalous suppression in pb - pb collisions arises from the occurrence of the quark - gluon plasma , it is necessary to obtain further collaborative experimental evidence .",
    "one can use the abundance of d - mesons and charm hyperons to probe the chemical content of the new absorbing phase , so as to infer the chemical state of the system .",
    "much future work remains to be done to identify the quark - gluon plasma if it is ever produced in high - energy pb - pb collisions ."
