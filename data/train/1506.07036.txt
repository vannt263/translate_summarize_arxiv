    "they interpreted this period as a consequence of the orbital motion of a supermassive binary black hole ( smbbh ) , and suggested that pg  1302102 is a tight smbbh candidate with a separation of about 0.01  pc .",
    "pg  1302102 is a bright , flat - spectrum radio quasar at redshift @xmath7 @xcite hosted by an elliptical galaxy , as typical for radio - loud quasars .    the existence of smbbhs is a natural consequence of the hierarchical galaxy evolution where the galaxies and their central black holes ( bh ) grow via major mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the first phase of the evolution , field stars carry away the energy of the binary black hole ( bbh ) and the binary shrinks under the control of the dynamical friction . after the depletion of stars in the nuclear region , an intermediate phase follows .",
    "the binary spends the majority of its lifetime at separations of @xmath8  pc @xcite . in the third phase ,",
    "the gravitational radiation takes over in the energy and orbital angular momentum dissipation , gradually leading to a merger .",
    "the sub - pc separation of the putative smbbh in pg  1302102 @xcite suggests that this binary already evolved into the third , inspiral phase of the merger .",

    "studies suggest that a fast rotating bh might give rise to relativistic jets emanating from the core @xcite , causing the radio loudness of the source via synchrotron radiation of the charged particles spiralling in the magnetic field with relativistic speeds .",

    "they obtained the following best - fitting parameters : lorentz factor @xmath48 , intrinsic half - opening angle @xmath49 , inclination angle @xmath50 . considering that @xcite used optical data with an assumed value of the spectral index , and our results are estimated independently from high - resolution mojave radio data adopting a commonly used value for the intrinsic temperature of the vlbi core , the two sets of parameters are qualitatively consistent with each other .",
    "we can thus conclude that the pc - scale radio structure is compatible with the smbbh model proposed by @xcite .",

    "the `` core '' and the northern jet is represented by 7 components , while the southern jet is described with just two components .",
    "the latter do not allow us to fit any meaningful geometric model . on the other hand , by assuming that the positions of the gaussian components in the northern jet follow a helical geometry , we could fit a simple precession model to the data ( see rotation matrices in * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : vla_helixfit ] .",
    "it is important to realize that the components themselves are not supposed to move along this helix , rather their instantaneous positions form a helix that is expanding as the components move away from the core on their ballistic paths .",

    "the structure of the southern jet is clearly different , indicating that this simple precessing jet model can not be applied to describe it . the asymmetric kpc - scale extended radio structure in this object",
    "could perhaps be explained by jet bending due to jet  cloud interactions in the host galaxy .",
    "we estimate the precession period of the northern kpc - scale jet , assuming that the components indeed trace out a helical structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vla_helixfit ] ) .",
    "the physical expansion rate of the helical jet pattern is described by the deprojected axial ( @xmath61 ) and radial growth ( @xmath62 ) of the jet during one spatial period .",
    "then the precession period in the rest frame of the source is    t_== ,    where @xmath63 is the jet speed on kpc scale , and @xmath64  kpc  arcsec@xmath15 is the angular scale at the redshift of the source .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of the precession period is possible if we assume @xmath65 for the kpc - scale jet expansion ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath66 is nearly @xmath67  yr .",
    "contrary to the pc - scale jet , the existence of the extended two - sided kpc - scale radio structure in the core - dominated source pg  1302102 indicates large jet inclination .",
    "however , the structure of the ( northern ) kpc - scale jet characterised by our helical model ( fig .  [ fig : vla_helixfit ] ) can not be straightforwardly explained in the context of the same binary bh system .",
    "the intrinsic half - opening angle of the kpc - scale jet ( @xmath68 ) is much smaller than the difference between the inclination of the kpc - sclale ( @xmath69 ) and pc - scale ( @xmath70 ) jets .",
    "this rules out the scenario where the pc - scale jet slowly precesses about the symmetry axis of the kpc - scale jet , within its cone .",
    "in other words , assuming that the pc - scale jet points to the direction of the spin of the bh responsible for the jet launching , the kpc - scale structure can not be interpreted simply with the precession of the black hole spin in the binary system described by @xcite .    however , the kpc - scale helical structure , if real , could possibly be reconciled with the smbbh model if a significant jet reorientation , i.e. a spin - flip @xcite happened in a transition phase between the production of the kpc- and pc - scale jets .",
    "we will further elaborate this possibility in section  [ smbbh-3 ] and find it unlikely based on the derived bbh parameters of the system .",
    "an alternative , albeit more speculative explanation is that the outer and inner structures were produced by different black holes of the binary system .",
    "they might have changed their activity status in a way that the one responsible for the kpc - scale jet `` switched off '' , and the other one now producing the pc - scale jet `` turned on '' the jet production fuelled by matter accretion . in this scenario ,",
    "the different jet orientations are naturally explained by the different spin directions of the two central engines .",
    "another , similarly speculative scenario involves the interaction of three bhs , where initially two bhs merged and reached the final coalescence . in this picture",
    ", the kpc - jet would show the imprint of the interaction of the two bhs , revealing the spin - orbit precession of the dominant spin",
    ". then a spin - flip reorients the spin , causing a sudden directional change of the jet , and the final coalescence happens .",
    "the newly - merged bh catches a third bh and emanates the jet seen in pc scale .",
    "this jet unveils the orbital motion of the newly - formed binary .",
    "however , considering the estimated precession period of the kpc - scale jet as the consequence of spin - orbit precession , the gravitational lifetime would be several million years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ruling out the possibility of a recent final merger in the system .    in an alternative three - body interaction scenario ,",
    "the third bh could have been kicked out from the system due to a gravitational slingshot effect , rather than being absorbed .",
    "this is similar to one of the proposed explanations for the object cid-42 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the orbital angular momentum could have been transferred to the current primary bh , causing a spin flip without invoking a recent bh merger within the past several million years .",
    "simulations beyond the scope of this paper would be needed to prove the feasibility of this scenario .",
    "we may also try to explain the kpc - scale helical structure assuming that it results from the precession of the accretion disk of the primary bh , induced by the disk - crossing motion of the secondary bh @xcite .",
    "however , it would imply that the distance between the outer edge of the accretion disk and the primary bh is @xmath71 times smaller than the orbital separation , ruling out the physical interaction between the disk and the secondary bh .",
    "finally , it is also possible that the northern jet is in fact not helical , and therefore is not shaped by precession . even in this case , the apparent discrepancy between the relatively large jet inclination on kpc scale on the one hand , and on pc scale on the other hand needs to be explained .",
    "asymmetries in the dense interstellar medium surrounding the core , and jet  cloud interactions may result in the deflection of the jet flow ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) in a different way on both sides of the core .",
    "such interactions were suspected by @xcite who analysed the spatial correlation of the high - resolution optical and radio structures in pg  1302102 .",
    "we use the bbh - in - jet model presented in our earlier work @xcite to derive parameters of the putative smbbh in pg  1302102 . the underlying process revealing the presence of the binary is that the orbital motion of the jet - emitter bh modifies the average inclination angle of the jet launching on the orbital time scale . using time - travel argument",

    "<S> we investigate the pc - scale kinematics and kpc - scale radio morphology of the quasar pg  1302102 , which may harbour a sub - pc separation supermassive binary black hole system at its centre as inferred from optical variability . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution radio interferometric measurements obtained with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) in the monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ( mojave ) programme at 15  ghz at 20 epochs spanning 17 years were analysed to investigate the pc - scale radio structure . </S>",
    "<S> archival observations with the very large array ( vla ) at @xmath0  ghz and @xmath1  ghz were obtained to study the kpc - scale morphology . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pc - scale jet is inclined within @xmath2 to the line of sight and has a half - opening angle of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters derived from the pc - scale radio jet are qualitatively consistent with those obtained from the analysis of the optical light curve of pg  1302102 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain at least @xmath4 for the mass ratio of the two black holes in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we find some indication for a helical jet structure on kpc - scale , but the directions of the inner and the extended radio jets are significantly different , obstructing a straightforward connection of the pc- and kpc - scale jets within the binary scenario .    </S>",
