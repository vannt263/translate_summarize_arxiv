    "flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes have attracted renewed attention since the recent cleo measurement of the fcnc decays of the type @xmath2 . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "these processes are forbidden at the tree level and are strongly suppressed by the gim mechanism , in particular for up type quarks .",
    "hence they offer a unique possibility to test the ckm sector of the sm and possibly open a window to physics beyond the sm .    from the experimental side",
    "there is some data on the exclusive decay @xmath3 and the inclusive decay @xmath4 with branching fractions @xcite @xmath5 which is at present compatible with the sm .",
    "however , the experimental as well as the theoretical uncertainties are still sizable ; in particular an improvement of the theoretical prediction involves a next - to - leading order calculation which has recently become available @xcite .",
    "various scenarios have been used to calculate the influence of physics beyond the sm on the decay @xmath2 and also model independent analyses have been suggested @xcite . however , based on the decays of @xmath6 mesons it will not be possible to analyse the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian mediating the decay @xmath2 , since the information on the handedness of the quarks is lost in the hadronization process .    the only way to access",
    "the helicity of the quarks is to consider the decay of baryons . from the experimental side",
    "the decay @xmath0 is a good candidate , since the subsequent @xmath7 decay @xmath8 is self analyzing .",
    "the only experimental drawback of this mode is that the production rate of @xmath9 baryons in @xmath10 quark hadrionization is about an order of magnitude smaller than the rate for @xmath6 mesons , and hence the analysis suggested here has to wait for more data on heavy quark decays from colliders .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "one may make use of the heavy quark symmetry for the @xmath10 quark .",
    "the @xmath11 transition is of the heavy - to - light type for which heavy quark symmetries restrict the number of form factors for the baryonic transition @xmath12 light spin-1/2 baryon to only two .",
    "these heavy quark symmetries are expected to work best at the point of maximal momentum transfer @xmath13 ( corresponding to small recoil to the light degrees of freedom ) , whereas in the decay under consideration we are at the opposite side of phase space , namely at @xmath14 .",
    "we shall still use heavy quark symmetry , at least it will be a reasonable model assumption for the form factors .",
    "once we use heavy quark symmetries over the whole phase space , one may obtain the form factors from the semileptonic decay @xmath1 , for which some data exists @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , data are still not good enough to allow a measurement of the two form factors as a function of @xmath15 , and consequently one has to model the form factor shape using some ansatz .",
    "this makes the predicted total rate to some extent uncertain , while the polarization of the @xmath7 is practically unaffected by the choice of a model .    another theoretical difficulty with the process suggested are possible long distance contributions which will dilute the effects of a non - sm - contribution to the short distance effective hamiltonian for @xmath16 .",
    "there are two effects of this kind : a vector dominance contribution from the process @xmath17 and the internal @xmath18 exchange .",
    "both contributions are hard to estimate , since one has to refer to models .    in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the short distance contribution and its hadronic matrix elements . in section 3 we shall use simple models to estimate the long distance contributions . in section 4",
    "we shall use the input of the semileptonic @xmath19 decay and two simple models for the form factors to obtain a prediction for the total rate of @xmath0 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a discussion of the polarization variable and its connection to the parameters of the short distance part of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the standard model and the sensitivity to non - standard model effects are considered .",
    "finally we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "in the sm as well as in many non - sm scenarios , the hamiltonian relevant for @xmath11 transitions consists of ten operators @xmath20 , of which only one ( @xmath21 ) mediates the decay @xmath2 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian has the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 f^{\\mu \\nu}\\ ] ] where the renormalization scale @xmath24 is usually taken to be @xmath25 .",
    "it is well known that the leading - log calculation exhibits a strong residual dependence on the renormalization point @xmath24 , since the qcd corrections encoded in @xmath26 are sizable .",
    "recently the complete next - to - leading order calculation has been performed and we shall use the value for @xmath26 from this calculation .    a more general form of the operator @xmath21 allowing for non  sm couplings is _ 7 = m_b |s _ ( g_v - g_a_5 )",
    "b f^ where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the vector and axial vector couplings , respectively . in the standard model g_v=1+m_sm_b ,",
    "g_a=-1+m_sm_b the correction to the integer values of @xmath28 and @xmath27 due to the non - vanishing @xmath29 quark mass is of the order of 3% .",
    "hence in general at the level of dimension - six operators there are two operators relevant for the decay under discussion , namely the one with right - handed @xmath10 quark ( implying left - handed @xmath29 quark ) and the one with right - handed @xmath29 quark ( implying left - handed @xmath10 quark ) .",
    "in other words , in general there are two parameters , which may be taken to be @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "once the short distance structure of the effective hamiltonian is known , it remains to calculate matrix elements of the operators . in the present case",
    "we shall make use of the fact that the @xmath10 quark is heavy , while the @xmath29 quark is taken to be a light quark .",
    "in general , heavy quark symmetries restrict the number of possible form factors quite significantly ; in the present case there are only two , parametrized by @xcite [ heavytolightdecay ] = |u_(p , s ) \\ { f_1(p.v)+v f_2(p.v ) } u__b ( v , s ) where @xmath32 is the velocity of the heavy @xmath9baryon which in hqet is equal to the velocity of the heavy @xmath10quark , @xmath33 is the spin of the heavy @xmath9 , which due to heavy quark spin symmetry equals the spin of the @xmath10 quark , @xmath34 is the momentum of the @xmath7baryon and @xmath29 its spin .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 is an arbitrary dirac matrix , such that any transition between a @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and a light spin @xmath38 baryon is given by the same form factors . in particular , this allows us to compare the exclusive semileptonic decay of a @xmath19 with the process under consideration here , although the helicity structure of the relevant currents is completely different .",
    "heavy quark symmetries are expected to work best at the point where the final state light hadron is slow ( in the rest frame of the decaying hadron ) , such that the momentum transfer to the light degrees of freedom is small . at the other end of phase space , @xmath14",
    ", it is easy to see that the the momentum transfer to the light degrees of freedom scales with the mass of the heavy quark , it is not clear whether heavy quark symmetries are applicable at this point .",
    "however , we shall still make use of heavy quark symmetries even for @xmath39 , taking this in the worst case as a model assumption .",
    "keeping this in mind , the matrix element of the operator @xmath40 between the initial and final state is & & ( p , s ) , ( k,)| o_7 | _ b(v , s ) + & & = e16 ^ 2 m_b ( p , s ) ||s _ 12 ( g_v - g_a5 ) b | _ b(v , s ) ( k,)|f^|0 the quantity of interest is the decay rate of unpolarized @xmath9 baryons into @xmath7 baryons with a definite spin directions @xmath29 . to obtain from this expression this rate as a function of the form factors taken at @xmath14 is a matter of algebra , and we obtain & = & c_7 ^ 2 g_f^2 ( v_ts^*v_tb)^2 ( e16 ^ 2)^2 m_b^2 ^3 ( 1- x^2 ) + & & \\ { g_v^2 + g_a^2 2 [ ( 1 - 2x^2+x^4 ) |f_1|^2 + & & + ( x-2x^3+x^5)(f_1 f_2^ * + f_1^ * f_2 ) + & & + ( x^2 - 2x^4+x^6)|f_2|^2 ] + & & + g_v g_a ( v.s ) [ ( 2x-2x^3 ) |f_1|^2 + & & + ( 2x^2 - 2x^4)(f_1 f_2^ * + f_1^ * f_2 ) + & & + ( 2x^3 - 2x^5)|f_2|^2 ] } [ gammashortdistance ] where @xmath41 .",
    "as expected , the terms which depend on the spin of the @xmath7 are all proportional to @xmath42 , while the rest of the rate has the factor @xmath43 .",
    "thus a polarization analysis of the final state @xmath7 allows a determination of the ratio @xmath44 .    in order to comply with the standard definitions we rewrite the rate in terms of the polarization variables as defined in @xcite = _ 0 where @xmath45 is the momentum vector of the @xmath7 and @xmath46 is its spin vector . using expression ( [ gammashortdistance ] )",

    "in order to obtain a realistic estimate of the branching ratio and of the sensitivity on the coupling constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 one also has to take into account the long distance contributions .",
    "one may distinguish between two types of contributions : the vector - meson - dominance like contributions , where there is a vector meson intermediate state and the internal @xmath18-boson exchange , which corresponds to the weak transition of the heavy @xmath9 into excited @xmath7 states decaying subsequently into @xmath7 and a photon .",
    "the vector - dominance like contributions are dominated by the ckm allowed contributions where one has a @xmath52 as the internal vector meson .",
    "they are governed by a different part of the @xmath53 hamiltonian given by h_eff^c|c = g_f v_cs^*v_cb(c_1 o_1 + c_2 o_2 ) [ heffshortandcc ] with _ 1 & = & ( |s__(1 - 5 ) b_)(|c _ ^(1 - 5)c _ ) , + o_2&=&(|s__(1 - 5 ) b_)(|c _ ^(1 - 5)c _ ) , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are @xmath56 indices and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the corresponding wilson coefficients .",

    "the second kind of long distance contribution is the one originating from internal @xmath18 exchange .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are depicted in fig.[internalwex ] .",
    "this contribution is even more difficult to calculate and we shall perform a relatively crude estimate .",
    "the idea we are going to employ is along the lines of brodsky and lepage @xcite . in this picture the decay amplitude is decomposed into a hard piece which is calculated in terms of perturbative qcd while the soft contribution is described in terms of wave functions .",
    "since in this picture a baryon is still a relatively complicated object , we shall simplify further by gathering the up and the down quark in the @xmath9 and the down and strange quark of the @xmath7 into diquarks .",
    "this picture is in fact to some extent motivated from the phenomenological side , since it has been advertised as an explanation of the @xmath73 rule in hyperon decays @xcite .",
    "hence we shall describe the baryons effectively as a bound state of a diquark and a @xmath10 quark or an @xmath74 quark , respectively .",
    "the hard process in the sense of brodsky and lepage is a @xmath75 transition in which the weak boson is absorbed by the @xmath76 diquark , transforming it into a @xmath77 diquark . in order to conserve energy and momentum a photon",
    "is radiated off , making this in total a @xmath0 transition .",
    "= 2.12 cm = 2.12 cm = 2.12 cm = 2.12 cm    to perform the calculation one has to define feynman rules for the radiation and the weak transition of the diquarks , which are simply obtained from the corresponding interactions of scalar particles in a straightforward way .",
    "note that in order to ensure gauge invariance one also has to include a `` seagull '' term corresponding to a diquark-@xmath18-@xmath78 coupling .",
    "the feynman rules are given in fig.[frules ] and these allow us a calculation of the hard part of the decay amplitude .",
    "the soft contributions are parametrized in terms of wave functions of the two constituents of the baryons . in the spirit of @xcite",
    "we neglect the transverse components of the momenta of the constituents .",
    "the @xmath9 is moving with the velocity @xmath32 and hence we write for the for the momentum @xmath34 of the @xmath10 quark @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the momentum of the @xmath76 diquark .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath81 for the momentum of the @xmath74 quark in the @xmath7 and @xmath82 for the momentum of its @xmath83 diquark .",
    "the wave functions describing the soft part are @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the @xmath9 and the @xmath7 , which are functions of the momentum fractions @xmath86 and @xmath87 . for the @xmath9",
    "we assume that the @xmath10 quark carries almost all momentum , which means that @xmath86 fiffers from one only by terms of the order @xmath88 , such that @xmath89 is independent of @xmath25 in the heavy mass limit .",
    "hence we use @xmath90 for the wave functon of the @xmath9 .    for the @xmath7",
    "all the quarks have comparable masses and we use a simple ansatz such that the average of @xmath87 is @xmath91 .",
    "motivated by the corresponding ansatz for the pion wave function we use @xmath92 where we have assumed that the analogue of the decay constant is simply @xmath93 .    using this picture for the internal @xmath18 exchange it turns out that its contribution is much smaller than the long distance contribution of the vector dominance type .",
    "this is not a surprise , since the internal @xmath18 exchange is on one hand suppressed by the small combination @xmath94 of ckm elements , on the other hand it contains two decay constants @xmath93 and @xmath95 , yielding another suppression by a factor @xmath96    in total , in the way we have estimated the long distance contributions they turn out to be small , such that the decay @xmath0 is dominated by the short distance piece , which may be sensitive to new physics .",
    "quantitatively , the long distance corrections are dominated by the vector - dominance contribution . summing over the lowest six @xmath60 we find that the long distance contributions may be absorbed into a redefinition of the coupling constants @xmath28 and @xmath27 according to = g_v + = g_a - , = 0.035 [ rho ]",
    "since we are dealing with an exclusive decay , we eventually need some input for the form factors in order to calculate numbers . however , not much is known about these functions , except that they have to obey the heavy quark symmetry implied by the heavy - to - light transition we are considering . in particular , at least at maximum momentum transfer the form factors appearing in @xmath97 transition and @xmath98 decays have to be the same , independent of the spin structure of the currents involved , see ( [ heavytolightdecay ] ) .",
    "again we shall assume heavy quark symmetry over all phase space including @xmath14 in @xmath97 and extract the relevant form factors from @xmath1 , which is according to ( [ heavytolightdecay ] ) given by the same two form factors as @xmath0 .",
    "for the semileptonic @xmath19 decay there is some experimental data @xcite ; the total rate and the form factor ratio @xmath99 has been measured , where the brackets indicate a particular average over phase space .",
    "nothing is known about the @xmath15 dependence of the form factors and at that point model assumptions enter the game .",
    "we shall start from a simple pole model for both form factors @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mass of the nearest resonance with the correct quantum numbers for @xmath102 and @xmath103 rspectively and @xmath104 is a normalization factor .",
    "the form factors in ( [ heavytolightdecay ] ) are given in terms of the energy @xmath105 of the outgoing light baryon which has a simple relation with the momentum transfer @xmath106 .",
    "inserting this into the denominator of our form factor parametrization we have @xmath107 where we have neglected the mass of the light baryon .",
    "the relevant resonances contain a heavy quark and some light degrees of freedom and hence the mass of the resonance is @xmath108 , where we shall in the following identify @xmath109 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is small compared to the heavy quark mass and does not scale with the heavy mass ; it remains a constant as @xmath110 .",
    "using this the denominator of the pole fomula for the form factors becomes @xmath111 for the @xmath98 transition the relevant resonance for the vector current is the @xmath112 and since in the heavy mass limit @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 mev , while for the bottom decay @xmath97 we have the @xmath115 in the vector channel , and hence here we obtain @xmath116 mev .",
    "thus we have a fairly consistent picture and shall use @xmath117 mev , it turns out that the dependence of our results on @xmath7 is weak .    putting the pieces together we use as a parametrization of the form factors in the heavy mass limit @xmath118 whre we assume for simplicity the same @xmath119 dependence for both form factors . in this simple case",
    "the ratio of the form factors @xmath120 is independent of @xmath119 and we may use the value measured by cleo without worrying about the phase space average going into the measurement .",
    "we shall use @xcite @xmath121 the large uncertainty in this value does not imply a large uncertainty in our results since any appearance of the form factor @xmath103 is suppressed by a factor @xmath122 .    using the measured branching ratio for @xmath123 and the lifetime of @xmath19 from @xcite one obtains the normalization @xmath124 @xmath125 ) for the extrapolation to @xmath14 in the decay @xmath0 we obtain for the form factors @xmath126",
    "this may be inserted into ( [ gammashortdistance ] ) with the corrections from ( [ rho ] ) to obtain the total rate for the decay @xmath0 in the standard model .    in the heavy mass limit",
    "the mass of the @xmath9 is equal to the @xmath10 quark mass and hence the total rate depends on @xmath127 , where some of the mass dependence comes from phase space ( and is actually @xmath128 ) and some is due to the @xmath25dependence of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "to get rid of this @xmath127dependence we take as a reference the inclusive semileptonic decays of the @xmath6 meson and write : = br(_b ) br(b x_c l ) [ brlbtolg ] the inclusive semileptonic decay rate of @xmath6 mesons depends also on @xmath127 and is given by ( b x_c l)=m_b^5 g_f^2 v_cb^2 192 ^3 _ qcd r_c , [ btoxlnu ] where @xmath129 is a qcd correction and @xmath130 is a phase space factor .    using the lifetimes and the inclusive semileptonic branching fraction @xmath131 from @xcite we obtain br(_b ) = ( 1- 4.5 ) 10 ^ -5 , where the lower and upper value corresponds to a dipole and monopole @xmath15 evolution of the form factors , respectively .    for values of @xmath28 and @xmath27 different from the standard model ones one has to multiply the above equation by the factor @xmath132 , neglecting the strange quark mass and the long distance contributions .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the possibility of using the decay @xmath0 as a test of the standard model and to what extent it could be a possible window to new physics .    as opposed to its mesonic counterpart , the decay @xmath3",
    ", the baryonic rare decay @xmath0 allows access to the helicity structure of the short distance piece of the effective hamiltonian , since the helicity of the final state @xmath7 can be measured .",
    "the two relevant dimension-5 operators entering the short distance part are parametrized in terms of two coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath30 and the polarization of the final state @xmath7 is sensitive to these couplings .",
    "the first piece of information is the total rate of @xmath0 which contains ( as does the mesonic decay @xmath3 ) information on the combination @xmath133 , while the polarization variable @xmath54 defined in ( [ alphadef ] ) contains information on @xmath134 .",
    "as we have discussed above , our rough estimates of the long distance contributions indicate that they are very small and will not significantly influence the sensitivity of the @xmath47 measurement on the parameters of the short distance part of the effective hamiltonian .    in the following",
    "we shall use the measurement of the inclusive rate @xmath4 to fix @xmath133 ; in the @xmath30@xmath31plane a measurement of any total rate ( meaning any of the processes @xmath4 , @xmath3 or @xmath0 ) will correspond to a circle , since all these decay rates are proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "if in future experiments a measurement of @xmath47 in @xmath0 is performed one may use the relation between @xmath47 and @xmath134 . including our estimate of the long distance contributions , one obtains @xmath135 which corresponds to straight lines in the @xmath31@xmath30 plane . neglecting the long distance contribution ( i.e.  @xmath136 ) these lines would go through the origin ; including our estimate for these long distance contributions we also need an input for the wilson coefficient @xmath26 , for which we shall use the standard model value as obtained form the nllo calculation in @xcite .    in fig.[gagvfig ]",
    "we plot the @xmath31@xmath30 plane .",
    "the central circle corresponds to the central value of the measurement of @xmath4 and the thin circles indicate the experimental uncertainty . assuming the standard model values for @xmath31 and @xmath30 we have also plotted the corresponding lines .",
    "the width of these lines is given by our estimate for the long distance contributions ; we have taken this estimate as an additional uncertainty meaning that the width of these lines is @xmath137 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath47 yields in general two lines which have in total four intersections with the circle . the two intersections of each line correspond to a sign interchange @xmath138 and at the same time @xmath139 which is an unobservable phase .",
    "the remaining ambiguity corresponds to the interchange @xmath140 and @xmath141 , since the polarization variable and the total rate are symmetric functions of @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "graphically this means that the two lines for a measured value of @xmath49 are mirror images of each other with respect to the lines @xmath142 . in order to resolve this ambiguity additional measurements",
    "would be necessary .    in the sm @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) up to corrections from the not - vanishing @xmath29 quark mass ,",
    "therefore the two solid lines almost coincide for the sm value of @xmath47 .",
    "we also have plotted two dashed lines for a hypothetical measurement of @xmath145 .",
    "with the advent of the second generation @xmath10 physics experiments , bottom baryons will provide a wealth of additional information on @xmath10 quarks .",
    "in particular , specific aspects of fcnc decays can be tested which are not accessible in @xmath6 mesons decays .    as its mesonic counterpart , @xmath0",
    "is dominated by the short distance part of the effective hamiltonian , although there are additional long distance effects such as internal @xmath18 exchange .",
    "we have estimated the long distance effects using standard methods and found a negligibly small contribution .",
    "thus one expects a good sensitivity to test the short distance part , the relevant piece of which is given in terms of two operators , which differ by the handedness of the @xmath10 quark .",
    "it is a particular property of the decays of the @xmath9 that they allow one to test the handedness of the effective interaction ; this is impossible in the corresponding meson decays .",
    "heavy quark symmetries imply relations between the form factors which are thought to hold best close to the point where the outgoing hadron is almost at rest . for the transition @xmath146 light spin-1/2 baryon",
    "there are only two independent form factors due to heavy quark symmetry .",
    "measuring these form factors in @xmath1 then allows us to predict other processes .",
    "unfortunately , in the process @xmath0 we are considering the end of the @xmath15 spectrum , where the @xmath7 receives a large recoil of the order of the @xmath10 quark mass , and hence heavy quark symmetries might fail .",
    "we still used the relations implied by them , which in the worst case is simply a model assumption .    using the input for the form factors obtained from @xmath1 we made predictions for the decay @xmath0 within the standard model and beyond .",
    "it turns out that a measurement of the polarization of the final state @xmath7 is quite sensitive to the handedness of the underlying effective short distance hamiltonian , up to a twofold ambiguity , which can not be resolved by a measurement of the rate and the polarization alone .    with a branching ratio for @xmath0 of the order @xmath147 one needs @xmath148 @xmath10 quarks to have about one hundred events , without applying cuts for efficiencies .",
    "clearly this will be feasible at dedicated @xmath10 physics experiments at colliders such as the one at tevatron or lhc , and possibly also at fixed target experiments like hera - b .",
