    "data reduction was done via eso - midas package and profiles were extracted by means of the modified version of fit / ell3 ellipse fitting command .",
    "decompositions were done using unweighted non - linear least - squares method for the simultaneous fitting of the composite model profile to the observed one .",
    "the model profiles library includes a gaussian law for nuclei and rings , a srsic law for bulges , pure and truncated exponent laws for disks and a flat bar profile for bars ( see prieto et  al .",

    "different combinations of model profiles were used for the individual galaxies in order to get satisfactory fits to the observational profiles .",
