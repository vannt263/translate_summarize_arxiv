    "one of the effective neutrino generation mechanisms is the plasmon decay .",
    "in contrast to ordinary photons in vacuum , plasmons , which are quanta of electromagnetic field in a plasma , can be not only transverse ( in this case two polarization vectors of plasmon are perpendicular to wave vector ) , but longitudinal as well .",

    "itoh et al .  ( 1992 ) calculated the emissivity due to plasmon decay as a function of temperature and density and presented a table of numerical values and an approximate fit formula .",
    "unfortunately , this approximate formula does not reproduce analytical asymptotes for the emissivity and thus can be applied only in a restricted region of temperatures and densities ( near the maximum value of the emissivity ) .",
    "in addition , when calculating the emissivity , itoh et al .",
    "( 1992 ) used approximate expressions for the dielectric functions of electron gas and for plasmon dispersion relations which can be justified only at low enough temperatures ( in a strongly degenerate electron gas ) .    on the contrary ,",
    "braaten @xmath5 segel ( 1993 ) started with the most general expressions for the neutrino emissivity due to plasmon decay .",
    "they did not make any assumptions concerning degeneracy of the electron gas at calculating the dielectric functions and plasmon dispersion relations . to simplify their analysis , braaten @xmath5 segel ( 1993 ) suggested an elegant scheme to calculate approximately the dielectric functions , dispersion relations , and the neutrino emissivity .",

    "we would like to fill in the gaps in the literature devoted to the subject .",
    "we will ( _ i _ ) numerically calculate the neutrino emissivity due to plasmon decay making no assumptions concerning degeneracy or relativity of the electron gas ; ( _ ii _ ) employ the approximate scheme of braaten @xmath5 segel and find a fitting expression for the emissivity which reproduces the correct asymptotes .",

    "we present the fit expressions for the emissivity . in section 5",
    "we apply the results of the preceding sections and find an analytical formula describing the neutrino luminosity of white dwarfs as a function of their mass and internal temperature .",

    "therefore , the emissivity will have a maximum in a layer in which @xmath219 , and the neutrino luminosity of a star can be estimated as @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the white dwarf radius .",

    "we used this ratio in all our calculations .",
    "we have calculated the neutrino emissivity @xmath140 due to plasmon decay in an electron - positron plasma making no assumptions about degree of degeneracy or relativity of the electron gas .    when calculating the emissivity one needs the plasma dielectric functions as well as the dispersion relations for transverse and longitudinal plasmons in a wide range of temperatures and densities .",

    "the approximation is valid for @xmath100  k and @xmath232  g  @xmath2 .",
    "the root mean - square relative error of the approximation does not exceed 4% for those temperatures and densities , for which @xmath233 [ while at @xmath234 the emissivity is exponentially small , @xmath141 ] .",
