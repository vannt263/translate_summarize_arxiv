    "neutral mesons , in particular @xmath4 and @xmath1 mesons can be reconstructed and clearly identified using two - photon decays in a very wide @xmath5  range .",
    "this makes them an excellent tool both for testing qcd predictions of meson yields in pp collisions and estimating parton energy loss in pb - pb collisions . with these measurements at lhc energies one can access the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and fragmentation functions ( ff ) in new kinematic regions and provide further constraints on their low-@xmath6 ( low-@xmath7 ) parts .",
    "meson production at lhc energies is dominated by gluon fragmentation up to transverse momentum @xmath8",
    "gev/@xmath9 @xcite , a kinematic regime which makes them ideal to constrain quark as well as the lesser know gluon ff .",
    "measurement of the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions provides a clear pattern for identified particles and is free from ambiguity , such as that found in the separation of protons , kaons and pions in charged hadron suppression .",
    "photons from neutral meson decays can be detected either in the electromagnetic calorimeters phos or emcal , or can convert on the material of the inner detectors and be reconstructed via @xmath10 pair in the central tracking system .",

    "are presented .",

    "effort was made to reduce the material budget in front of phos as much as possible : @xmath16 .",
    "thanks to these conditions phos can resolve two photons from @xmath4 decay up to @xmath17 gev/@xmath9 .    in the case of conversion technique ,",

    "spectra were measured independently with pcm and phos , results which were in agreement and were subsequently combined into a final spectrum .",
