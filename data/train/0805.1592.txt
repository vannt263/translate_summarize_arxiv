    "it was also suggested ( fiorentino et al .",
    "2002 , hereinafter [ f02 ] ; marconi , musella & fiorentino 2005 , hereinafter [ m05 ] ) that the metallicity effect on cepheid distances _ based on @xmath13 and @xmath14 magnitudes _ , is not linear over the entire metallicity range @xmath7=0.004 - 0.04 , but presents a sort of `` turnover '' at roughly solar chemical composition . as a whole , the use of lmc - calibrated @xmath1-@xmath9 and @xmath1-@xmath10 relations to provide distance estimates with an intrinsic error of @xmath150.10 mag is fully justified for cepheids with @xmath16 10 days and/or helium - to - hydrogen enrichment ratio @xmath17 2.0 ( see e.g. f02 and m05 for more details ) . on the other hand , the average correction for cepheids with @xmath18 10 days , high metal abundances ( @xmath19 0.03 ) and @xmath20 3.0 is larger than 0.1 mag . as a consequence , cepheids with @xmath21 20 days and oxygen abundance and @xmath22 one has [ @xmath23=log@xmath24log@xmath25 . ] [ o / h]@xmath26 0.2 , as measured in several spiral galaxies observed by the @xmath4 key projects ( freedman et al .",

    "the overluminous models were constructed by adopting for the chemical compositions representative of galactic and magellanic cepheids the same abundances ( helium , metal ) and mass values adopted for canonical cepheid models .",

    "pulsation models constructed by adopting supersolar iron abundance and helium enhanced compositions ( @xmath72 ) are pulsationally unstable ( fiorentino et al .",

    "( 2007 ) found , using nearby field k - type dwarf stars , @xmath74 .",
    "the observational scenario is also complicated by the fact that we still lack firm empirical constraints on the linearity of the @xmath73 relation , when moving from the metal - poor to the metal - rich regime , and on the universality of this relation ( peimbert et al .",
    "2003 ; tammann et al .",
    "2008 ) . to account for these uncertainties we constructed sets of cepheid models by adopting , at fixed metal content , different helium abundances , therefore",
    ", the intrinsic error on the zero - point of predicted pl and pw relations include this effect ( fiorentino et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the theoretical wesenheit functions of each pulsator depend on the adopted luminosity , therefore , to avoid any assumption on the @xmath75 relation , we calculated for each model the difference log@xmath76 between the adopted luminosity and the canonical value provided by the bono et al .",

    "in this context , it is worth mentioning that the occurrence either of a mild convective core overshooting during hydrogen burning phases or mass - loss before and/or during the pulsation phases yields positive log@xmath76 values . as a consequence , the @xmath1-@xmath2 relations for @xmath5=@xmath79",
    "provide the _ maximum _ value of the cepheid distance .",
    "moreover , we draw attention on the evidence that the metallicity effect on the predicted @xmath1-@xmath2 relations depends on the adopted wesenheit function ( see also caputo , marconi & musella 2000 ; f02 ; f07 ) . in particular , the metallicity dependence of the @xmath1-@xmath80 relation is weak and shows the opposite sign when compared with the other optical @xmath1-@xmath2 relations .",
    "this is warning against the average of the various @xmath29 values based on different @xmath1-@xmath2 relations and , at the same time , provides a plain method to estimate the cepheid metal content ( see below ) .    by assuming that the pulsation models listed in table 1 are actual cepheids located at the same distance and with the same reddening , but with different chemical abundances",

    "as already suggested by the predicted @xmath1-@xmath2 relations given in table 2 , we find that the metallicity effect is _ not constant _ among the different approaches to estimate the lmc - relative distance moduli . on average , we derive @xmath930.59  mag  dex@xmath36 , @xmath940.12  mag  dex@xmath36 , and @xmath950.35  mag  dex@xmath36 , whereas the metallicity dependence of @xmath88 is smaller and seems to depend on the adopted metallicity range .",

    "in summary , the theoretical results suggest that , if the lmc - based @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 relations are used to get the distance to cepheids with metal content significantly different from the lmc abundance , then the values of the various @xmath31 formulations _ should not be averaged , but individually considered in order to keep the information provided by their different metal dependence_. note that if the @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 values were averaged to a mean value @xmath103 , the ensuing mean metallicity effect would be @xmath1040.15  mag  dex@xmath36 .",
    "this value _ can not _",
    "be used to correct distance estimates based on @xmath3 magnitudes since it might introduce a systematic error up to @xmath105 0.2 mag according to the metallicity range covered by the cepheids .    a further relevant result of the present study is the predicted metallicity effect on the _ internal differences _ among the different lmc - relative distance moduli . in particular , these differences revealed to be almost independent of the adopted @xmath75 relation .",

    "1 and listed in table 4 show that all the differences depend on the pulsator chemical composition .",
    "the most metal - sensitive are the @xmath106 , the @xmath107 and the @xmath108 .",
    "we have already discussed in f07 that these differences provide a robust method to estimate the cepheid metal content , since they are independent of both distance and reddening .",
    "we apply the same procedure described above to the smc cepheids collected by the ogle - ii microlensing survey ( udalski et al .",
    "for the sake of uniformity with the ngc  4258 variables ( see later ) , we use fundamental pulsators with @xmath21 6 days ( @xmath11 200 variables ) .",
    "we derive the mean @xmath31 values plotted in fig . 2 and summarized in table 5 , where the results for the lmc cepheids ( u99 ) are also given to validate the current approach .",
    "even though data plotted in fig .  2 present a large scatter , the four lmc - relative @xmath31 formulations do provide different results .",
    "in particular , the @xmath88 gives the shortest lmc - relative distance modulus , in agreement with the theoretical predictions . by using the predicted metallicity effects given in the last row of table 5 and the cepheid spectroscopic measurements [ fe / h]@xmath109 dex and [ fe / h]@xmath110 dex ( see luck et al .",
    "1998 ; romaniello et al .",
    "2005 ) and by assuming @xmath111$]=@xmath38[fe / h ] , we find that the measured @xmath91 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 values should be _ decreased _ by @xmath11 0.21 , 0.04 and 0.12 mag , whereas the @xmath88 value should be _ increased _ by @xmath11 0.04 mag .",
    "eventually , the discrepancy among the four @xmath31 values is mitigated and the metallicity - corrected results yield that the lmc - relative distance modulus of the smc cepheids is @xmath11 0.55 mag , in close agreement with the difference of 0.50 mag determined from eclipsing binaries in the smc ( hilditch , howarth & harries 2005 ) and in the lmc ( guinan , ribas & fitzpatrick 2004 ) .",

    "in addition , the straight comparison between the observed @xmath112 differences and the predicted values listed in table 4 gives log@xmath1131.92 and log@xmath1142.42 , which are consistent with the spectroscopic iron measurements once we assume [ fe / h]=[@xmath115 and @xmath116=0.024 ( grevesse et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we are aware that the solar chemical composition is under revision and that the recent analysis by asplund et al .",

    "are also plotted in fig .  9 by assuming that the oxygen abundance is a very robust proxy of the iron abundance ( i.e. [ fe / h]=[o / h ] ) .",
    "note that this assumption is fully justified by spectroscopic measurements which yield [ o / fe]=0@xmath150.14 dex over the range [ fe / h]=@xmath270.7 to + 0.30 dex ( see e.g. luck et al .",
    "moreover , recent spectroscopic measurements based on high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra of 30 galactic cepheids ( lemasle et al .",
    "2007 ) indicate that oxygen and other @xmath117-elements present radial gradients very similar to the iron gradient .",
    "this means that oxygen is a good proxy of the iron content across the galactic disk .",
    "moreover and even more importantly , empirical evidence indicates that oxygen nebular abundances agree with absorption line abundances ( hill 2004 ) .",
    "although the oxygen abundance of the ngc  4258 cepheids based on the za94 oxygen abundance gradient , is within the range spanned by magellanic and milky way cepheids , the observed @xmath112 values of several variables in the inner field deviate from the `` empirical '' @xmath112-[o / h ] relations provided by magellanic and galactic variables .",
    "this evidence indicates that cepheids in ngc  4258 might have a metal content that is significantly lower than the oxygen abundance based on their radial distance .    to make clear this feature , we select the inner field cepheids with @xmath148 ( sample a ) and the outer field cepheids with @xmath149 ( sample b ) for which the mean oxygen abundance suggested by the za94 gradient is [ o / h]@xmath145=+0.13@xmath150.08 and @xmath270.37@xmath150.09 dex , respectively .",
    "we show in table  7 and table  8 that the two samples have different lmc - relative distance moduli but nearly identical mean @xmath112 values , at odds with the behavior of magellanic and metal - rich milky way variables , as listed in the same table  8 . in conclusion",
    ", the observed @xmath112 values would suggest an average lmc - like oxygen abundance [ o / h]@xmath980.4 dex for all the ngc  4258 cepheids .",
    "this result agrees with the za94-based mean value of the outer field , whereas for the inner field the oxygen content provided by the radial distance appears to be 1.3 times larger than the solar value .",
    "we do not found any reason to distrust this intriguing result , since the selection criteria adopted by m06 are very robust , and indeed , we only use objects with errors in mean @xmath150 magnitudes smaller than 0.05 mag .",
    "the adopted @xmath151=6 days should avoid contamination by first overtone cepheids , although the effects of period uncertainties on the @xmath112 differences are quite small and first overtone pulsators should give smaller @xmath112 values than fundamental pulsators with the same period .",
    "however the selection of cepheids with @xmath16 10 days is more difficult , in particular in the inner field ( see m06 ) .",
    "therefore , we performed a new test by removing these short period variables from the sample and we found that the new results are almost identical to those listed in table  7 and table  8 .    eventually , it seems plausible to suspect that either the za94 oxygen gradient requires a revision , or the galactic location can not be used as a reliable metallicity parameter for individual cepheids , or a combination of the above effects .",

    "it is quite clear that the variations in abundance among external regions with @xmath1521.2 are greater than the abundance uncertainties and that the lowest value ( 12+log(o / h)=8.4 ) measured by za94 at @xmath137=1.18 strongly affects the slope of equation ( 15 ) . indeed , if we neglect this value the linear fit to all the za94 and the ok93 measurements yields ( dashed line ) a significantly flatter gradient , namely    @xmath153    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "10 shows that all the cepheids in the ngc  4258 inner field are located close to h  ii regions where , as described by equation ( 16 ) , the oxygen abundance has the almost constant solar value , i.e. 12+log(o / h)=8.86@xmath150.08 . on the other hand ,",
    "the variables in the outer field are distant from any observed h  ii region , and only marginally close to the h  ii region underabundant in oxygen ( 12+log(o / h)=8.4 ) .",
    "even though , we assume a tight star - by - star correlation between oxygen abundance and radial distance , we find that by using the equation ( 16 ) to estimate the individual abundances of ngc  4258 cepheids would yield a mean abundance difference of only @xmath11 0.15 dex between the inner and the outer field .",
    "this would imply that the ngc  4258 is not the right laboratory to constrain the metallicity effect on the lmc - relative distance moduli . on the other hand ,",
    "the assumption of a lower oxygen abundance for the outer field variables would imply that the galactic gradient becomes significantly steeper when moving from the western to the eastern direction .",

    "therefore , the galactic gradients become significantly shallower than those estimated by previous determinations .    in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that diaz et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereinafter [ d00 ] ) , by performing a more detailed analysis of optical and near - infrared observations of several ngc  4258 regions previously observed by za94 and by ok93 , measured oxygen abundances that are on average a factor of two lower .",

    "this would also imply a reasonable agreement with the predicted correlation between the metal abundance and the @xmath112 values .",
    "in the above sections , we have shown that both the comparison with pulsation models and the most recent h  ii abundance measurements suggest a rather constant , lmc - like metal content for the cepheids observed in the two fields of ngc  4258 .",
