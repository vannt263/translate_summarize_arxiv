    "the ads / cft correspondence has over the years played an invaluable role in providing insight into the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "an important application of the correspondence has been to understand the holographic description of hydrodynamic properties of field theories .",
    "this can be used to understand qualitative features of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "current theoretical understanding of this system is that subsequent to rapid thermalization , the system evolves as an almost ideal fluid , expanding rapidly away from the central collision region .",
    "the evolution in this regime has been well described by the so called bjorken flow @xcite .",
    "the first step in understanding the holographic dual of the bjorken flow was taken in the seminal works @xcite , where the spacetime dual to the bjorken flow in @xmath0 super - yang mills was constructed as a perturbation expansion at late times ( see @xcite for recent review summarising the development of the holographic description of the boost invariant plasma ) .",
    "this geometry models the early ( but post - thermalization ) stages of the expanding quark gluon plasma .",
    "more generally , given any interacting quantum field theory , one can study its hydrodynamic regime .",
    "a natural question in the context of the ads / cft correspondence is whether this regime admits a holographic dual spacetime .",
    "this was answered in the affirmative in @xcite , where the authors proposed the _ fluid - gravity correspondence _ relating the dynamics of the field theory fluid to gravitational dynamics of black holes in an asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "the fluid - gravity correspondence generalizes the extensive discussion of hydrodynamics of field theories with gravitational duals super yang - mills see @xcite .",
    "extensions of the fluid - gravity correspondence to include forcing and charge transport have been considered in @xcite . ] and explicitly constructs spacetime geometries dual to fluid flows in the hydrodynamic regime ; that is , for cases where the fluid remains in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "this provides a useful relation between the dynamics of strongly coupled systems in the long - wavelength regime and corresponding asymptotically ads black hole geometries .",
    "it provides a new approach to the calculation of properties such as transport coefficients of the field theory fluid .    in general , the flow of a viscous fluid , which involves dissipation , necessarily leads to entropy production .",
    "this of course is a simple consequence of the second law of thermodynamics . in the geometric description of the fluid flow one can ask what this phenomenon of entropy production corresponds to .",
    "an important ingredient in the fluid - gravity correspondence was the identification of the global event horizon in the bulk spacetime , which turned out to provide a simple geometric construction for a boltzmann h - function in the bulk geometry .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the event horizon in the spacetimes dual to non - linear fluid flows could be determined essentially locally despite the teleological nature of event horizons .",
    "this was achieved by assuming slow temporal variations , as well as that the geometry will settle down to a stationary configuration at late times ( which is of course natural from the fluid dynamical point of view , as one expects the dissipative effects of viscosity etc .",
    ", to cause the fluid motion to slow down asymptotically and the system to achieve global equilibrium ) .",
    "the location of the event horizon is then given by a perturbation around this final equilibrium position .",
    "the perturbed position of the horizon can be determined order by order in the derivative expansion .",
    "the area - form of this event horizon when pulled back to the boundary was shown to lead to a natural local entropy current with non - negative divergence as required by the second law .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to extend this work to determine the location of the horizons in certain time - dependent geometries that do not settle down to stationary finite - temperature solutions at late times .",
    "our interest in this question originally arises from the bjorken flow ( bf ) geometry , but we will also consider the conformal soliton ( cs ) geometry , which provides a simpler example with stronger time dependence .    for the bjorken flow , explicitly constructing the event horizon will allow us to confirm the regularity of the bulk geometry . in @xcite ,",
    "the geometry was constructed as a perturbation expansion in the boundary time coordinate which is valid at late times . by demanding regularity of the solution at leading orders ,",
    "the authors were able to derive the transport properties of the plasma , most notably the shear - viscosity @xmath1 which saturates the famous bound @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the study of the gravitational dual at higher orders was undertaken to derive the relaxation time of the plasma in @xcite .",
    "however , the regularity of the dual spacetime was brought into question as subleading singularities were encountered @xcite .",
    "this issue was addressed recently in @xcite where the authors used the framework of the fluid - gravity correspondence @xcite to argue that the spacetime was indeed regular .",
    "we will revisit this analysis and confirm regularity by explicitly constructing the global event horizon for these geometries .",
    "previously , @xcite found the apparent horizon in the bf geometry , as an approximation to the event horizon ; here we confirm that the actual event horizon indeed closely tracks the location of the apparent horizon .",
    "since the bjorken flow does not settle down to a finite - temperature stationary state , we determine the event horizon by explicitly constructing the boundary of the past of the future null infinity @xmath3 .",
    "corresponds to ` endpoints ' of future - directed null geodesics and is timelike for asymptotically ads spacetimes . ]",
    "curiously , we find that the apparent horizon lies outside the event horizon at the leading order in the perturbation expansion .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the leading order metric violates energy conditions . at first order the event horizon overtakes the apparent horizon and",
    "the situation becomes more conventional .    the conformal soliton geometry @xcite provides a simpler example , where we can gain intuition about more general fluid flows .",
    "it is simply a patch of the well - known black hole , so the explicit metric is known exactly , and admits a high degree of symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , if we work in a coordinate system corresponding to considering the field theory on flat space @xmath4 rather than the einstein static universe @xmath5 , taking a ` poincar patch ' of the black hole , the time translation symmetry is no longer manifest , and the solution looks highly dynamical .",
    "pictorially , it corresponds to a black hole entering through the past poincar horizon and exiting through the future poincar horizon , with its closest approach to the boundary occurring at @xmath6 ( poincar time ) . in the boundary cft",
    ", this describes a finite energy lump which collapses and re - expands in a time - symmetric fashion . here",
    "the hydrodynamic approximation is not valid at all times , but because this fluid flow is conformal to a stationary fluid on the einstein static universe , the stress tensor is shear - free ; that is , there is no dissipation in this fluid flow .",
    "the horizons in this case are more interesting .",
    "naively one might expect that since we are just performing a coordinate transformation on a given solution , any geometrical feature , such as the location of the event horizon , remains invariant under such a transformation .",
    "in other words , we might expect that the event horizon of the poincar patch of black hole coincides with the event horizon of the global .",
    "however , as we argue below , this is not the case , because our coordinate patch now includes only part of the future infinity of the global . as a result ,",
    "the actual event horizon for the conformal soliton lies outside the global event horizon of .",
    "indeed , we discover that the area of the cs event horizon diverges at late times .",
    "this surprising result leads to a puzzle : if we associate the entropy of the corresponding cft conformal soliton state to the area of the cs event horizon , as is usually assumed to be the case , then we find that this entropy likewise diverges at late times .",
    "but the conformal soliton describes a shear - free flow , with no entropy production whatsoever .",
    "said differently , the conformal transformation from the cft on @xmath7 to the cft on @xmath4 should leave the entropy invariant .",
    "but the former describes a perfect fluid in global thermodynamic equilibrium : its entropy is finite and constant in time .    in fact",
    ", it has been argued previously in several different contexts @xcite that it may be more appropriate to associate the entropy of the cft configuration to the area of the apparent horizon rather than the event horizon in the bulk dual .",
    "we will show that the apparent horizon in this poincar slicing still coincides with the global event horizon , whose area is indeed constant .",
    "thus , this is a case where the event horizon and the apparent horizon are very different .",
    "the cs geometry therefore provides a good testing ground for studying the distinction between the event and apparent horizons and the role they play for the associated cft dual .",
    "we see that in this case the cft entropy is clearly more naturally associated with the latter rather than the former .",
    "this might also seem enigmatic , as it was argued in  @xcite that the apparent horizon and the event horizon track each other closely in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "again , the essential difference between the cases we consider here and  @xcite is that in that general analysis , it was assumed that the geometry would settle down at late times to a stationary finite - temperature black hole .",
    "neither of the geometries we consider have this property . for the bjorken flow ,",
    "we find qualitatively similar results , in that the apparent horizon and event horizon nevertheless track each other closely .",
    "but for the conformal soliton , the late time boundary conditions force the apparent horizon and the event horizon to behave very differently .    in the next section",
    ", we consider the bjorken flow , summarizing previous work and determining the location of the event horizon . in ,",
    "we consider the horizons in the conformal soliton , focusing on the three - dimensional case , where the calculations are simplest .",
    "we conclude in with a discussion of the lessons of these examples and open problems for the future .",
    "the appendices collect generalizations and some of the more technical arguments .",
    "as described in the introduction , the bjorken flow ( bf ) plays a central role in understanding the post - thermalization evolution of the qgp produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the basic physical picture developed in @xcite is that in the central rapidity region of ultra - relativistic collisions of heavy ions , assuming local thermal equilibrium , one can model the flow of the plasma via quasi - ideal hydrodynamics . in the hydrodynamic description , it is assumed that the fluid evolution respects the boost symmetry along the collision axis .",
    "this implies a boost invariant expansion of the fluid , consistent with the observed distribution of the particles in the collision process .      to understand the hydrodynamics in the bf , consider minksowski spacetime @xmath4 written in milne - type coordinates which respect boost invariance in a @xmath8 subspace , i.e. , @xmath9 the coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 measure the proper time and rapidity in the longitudinal direction respectively , and @xmath12 collectively denotes the transverse directions .",
    "for a conformally invariant fluid , the equations of motion of hydrodynamics , viz . ,",
    "energy momentum conservation and tracelessness of stress tensor , @xmath13 can be shown to constrain the dynamics to be derivable from a single function @xmath14 which is conveniently taken to be the energy density @xcite . for an ideal conformal fluid , the equations of motion lead to a power law fall - off for the energy density and temperature @xmath15 with the entropy per unit rapidity remaining constant .",
    "it is clear from that there is a divergent amount of energy density localized on the forward light - cone , @xmath16 . nevertheless , as the fluid expands the energy density diffuses throughout the forward light - cone .",
    "at late times the ideal hydrodynamic description becomes more and more accurate in the interior of the light - cone in @xmath8 .",
    "one can in fact go beyond the ideal fluid description of the bf and argue that an expansion in powers of @xmath17 corresponds to the derivative expansion in the fluid dynamics . recall that the hydrodynamic description can be thought of as an ir effective field theory , valid at long wavelengths , for any interacting system that achieves local thermal equilibrium .",
    "given this , one can explore the dissipative corrections to fluid dynamics by studying the system in a perturbation expansion at large proper time @xmath10 .",
    "this was carried out in @xcite to include viscous corrections . to derive the transport properties of the plasma",
    ", the authors examined the gravitational dual of the flow in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .      in @xcite",
    ", the authors also constructed the bulk geometry dual to the given fluid dynamical evolution using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the bulk metric was written in a fefferman - graham type coordinate chart , and einstein s equations were solved to the desired order in a power series in @xmath18 at late times . to be precise ,",
    "consider an ansatz for the spacetime metric : @xmath19 the fefferman - graham expansion involves solving einstein s equations for the functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 perturbatively in the region @xmath23 , subject to asymptotic ads boundary conditions , i.e. , one expands the functions as .",
    "we have also for brevity ignored @xmath24 terms which appear in even spacetime dimensions . ]",
    "@xmath25 and similarly for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this perturbatively constructed solution , it was argued , could be re - expressed in terms of a scaling variable @xmath26 which then allows one to work at late proper times @xmath27 .",
    "this analysis leads to the above mentioned perturbation expansion in @xmath18 .",
    "for details we refer the reader to @xcite .    by demanding that the spacetime thus constructed",
    "be regular , it was shown that the shear - viscosity of the plasma saturates the universal lower bound @xmath28 . to demand regularity",
    ", the authors looked at the first non - trivial curvature invariant , the kretschmann scalar , @xmath29 , expanded in a power series in @xmath18 .",
    "of course , well behavedness of a single curvature invariant by itself does not guarantee that the spacetime is completely regular , but this was sufficient to fix the transport coefficients .    in @xcite this geometry",
    "was examined at higher orders , and it was found that the spacetime appears to be singular ( at the third order ) .",
    "the appearance of this singularity would seem contrary to the general analysis of the fluid - gravity correspondence in @xcite , where black hole solutions dual to arbitrary fluid flows in the boundary field theory were constructed in a derivative expansion and conjectured to be regular .",
    "however , the bf spacetime does not settle down to a stationary finite - temperature black hole , so the demonstration of the existence of a regular event horizon in  @xcite does not apply in this case .",
    "in fact , the appearance of a singularity is associated with a poor choice of coordinate system : in @xcite the authors chose to work with the fefferman - graham coordinatization of ads , which was argued in @xcite to be problematic for discussing regularity issues . indeed , to avoid this subtlety ,",
    "the original construction of gravitational duals of fluid flows was done in ingoing eddington - finkelstein type coordinates in @xcite . in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the gravity dual to the bf was constructed in the eddington - finkelstein coordinates , and it was argued that in these coordinates the bf geometry is indeed regular .",
    "let us review the details of this construction : we will follow the conventions of @xcite ( except for using @xmath10 rather than @xmath30 to denote the proper time coordinate ) . as we want",
    "the bulk geometry to asymptote to on the boundary and naturally adapt the coordinate chart to ingoing null geodesics , we have a metric ansatz : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 depend on @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the idea is to use as an ansatz and solve einstein s equations iteratively in a late time expansion , @xmath38 , keeping @xmath36 fixed . in order to do so",
    ", one assumes that the functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be expanded as @xmath39 to solve the einstein equations , one imposes the boundary conditions , @xmath40 which ensure that the spacetime has boundary metric consistent with the bjorken flow , .",
    "we will denote the metric obtained by this procedure at order @xmath41 as @xmath42 , so that @xmath42 is specified completely by the functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the einstein s equations for gravity ( with a negative cosmological constant ) were solved order by order in the late time expansion , and the solutions depend only on a set of arbitrary constants .",
    "these constants can be fully determined order by order by requiring that the geometry be asymptotically ads and that the kretschmann scalar is regular except at the origin @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this determines the choice of transport coefficients along the lines of the original philosophy espoused in @xcite .",
    "this is different from the result of @xcite because working in eddington - finkelstein coordinates imposes regularity on the future event horizon in the bulk geometry , which is the physically correct condition .",
    "we should note however that the regularity of a particular curvature invariant is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for regularity .    the rationale for the use of the eddington ",
    "finkelstein coordinates was given originally in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . to motivate this",
    "consider the hydrodynamic description of any interacting field theory ; as explained earlier this makes sense so long as one achieves local thermal equilibrium . in the ads",
    "/ cft context one expects each locally equilibriated domain in the field theory to have as gravity dual a stationary black hole solution .",
    "these domains in the field theory extend into the bulk as `` tubes '' along ingoing null geodesics . in a sense",
    ", the construction of the gravity solution perturbatively in boundary derivatives corresponds to patching together these tubes ( after all , this is what hydrodynamics achieves in the boundary description ) .",
    "specifically , the tubes of relevance were argued to be centered along radially ingoing null geodesics , which in the coordinatization of @xcite are just @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the boundary coordinates . in the present case of the bjorken flow ,",
    "the eddington - finkelstein coordinates not only makes issues of regularity more transparent , but also provides a sensible coordinate chart to perform the late proper time expansion .",
    "since there is no pathology in the coordinate chart in the zeroth order solution ( the metric being completely regular there ) , it can then be shown that the higher order corrections in the late proper time expansion remain regular @xcite .    at zeroth order ,",
    "one obtains the spacetime with metric @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a constant , whose precise value will not play a role in our discussion .",
    "this metric is consistent with the original derivation given in @xcite .",
    "note that this metric reduces to pure ads space for @xmath53 .",
    "naively it appears that is a black hole metric with the location of the horizon being given by the zero locus of @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 for the metrics at higher orders , and a comprehensive discussion of the derivation , we refer the reader to @xcite .      to further bolster the claim that the spacetime dual to the bf is regular , in @xcite the apparent horizon of the spacetime was determined explicitly up to second order in the @xmath10 expansion .",
    "the presence of an apparent horizon implies by virtue of the singularity theorems that the spacetime will evolve into a singularity in the future .",
    "the idea of @xcite was to argue that this apparent horizon must be enclosed by a global event horizon , concealing the singularities from the asymptotic region .",
    "this is a plausible argument , but to make it rigorous we would need to check that the spacetime asymptopia is complete . this requires a better understanding of the global structure , which is the main focus of the present work .",
    "we will explicitly construct the event horizon in this geometry in the next section , and demonstrate that the spacetime is regular on and outside the event horizon . before turning to that",
    "however , it will be useful to review the construction of the apparent horizon in @xcite .",
    "the apparent horizon is given by the null hypersurface for which the expansion of the outgoing null geodesics vanishes .",
    "for the metric , the vectors tangent to the ingoing and outgoing radial null geodesics are given by @xmath56 up to some overall normalisation factors that are irrelevant for this calculation .",
    "note that we are considering congruences that emanate normal to the co - dimension two spacelike surface in the spacetime and are exploiting the symmetries of the geometry to restrict our attention to normals pointing in the radial direction .",
    "then the expansions @xmath57 are defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the lie derivative along @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the volume of the null hypersurface , and @xmath62 are killing in the geometry . ]",
    "@xmath63 the quantity @xmath64 is an invariant , and hence the location of the apparent horizon can be found by solving @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "since the geometry is only known in a perturbative expansion in @xmath10 for large proper time , the location of the apparent horizon will also be determined in the power series .",
    "writing @xmath67 substituting this expansion into , and using the previously determined functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we can find @xmath66 order by order in @xmath18 . in @xcite",
    "this procedure was carried out up to the second order for the metric @xmath68 , with the result : and @xmath69 to denote the coefficients in the expansion of the apparent and event horizon for the metric @xmath42 . ]",
    "@xmath70    it is not surprising that the zeroth order location of the apparent horizon coincides with the naive horizon .      as discussed earlier , to convincingly demonstrate the regularity of the spacetime , we have to show that the spacetime has a well behaved global event horizon .",
    "this is defined as the boundary of the past of future infinity @xmath3 .",
    "it is by definition a null surface and furthermore since it is the boundary of a causal set , is generated by null geodesics . in the cases where the solution settles down to a stationary configuration",
    "asymptotically , we know the position of the horizon at late times , and can evolve back using the geodesic equation to determine the location of the event horizon . in the present case however , does not appear to settle down to a known stationary configuration .",
    "we will therefore determine the location of the horizon directly , by studying the geodesic motion on the spacetime and determining which points can not send signals to infinity .",
    "the analysis is simplified by the fact that is co - homogeneity two , so the problem reduces to studying geodesic motion in the @xmath71 plane .    since one",
    "has three killing fields @xmath72 and @xmath73 the location of the horizon is simply given by a curve @xmath66 .",

    "these constants can be found by solving order by order using the previously determined expansion for @xmath78 at the same order . using the metric @xmath68 quoted in @xcite we find that @xmath79 this gives the location of the event horizon up to second order in the late time expansion .",
    "comparing , with , we see that the event horizon indeed lies outside the apparent horizon at this order .",

    "indeed , at late poincar times , the event horizon approaches the intersection of the global spacetime boundary @xmath3 with the poincar horizon .",
    "one of the most important and physically interesting attributes of the event horizon is the area of its cross - sections , which we would usually take to give the entropy of the corresponding field theory state .",
    "we have seen that the horizon is dynamical , so we expect the area to be varying .",
    "although the induced metric on the horizon does not show explicit time dependence , the area variation arises because of the caustics ; if a cross - section of the horizon intersects the line of caustics , it will be parametrized by @xmath134 lying in some range @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is determined by the intersection of the cross - section with the caustic line .",

    "a simple family of cross - sections to consider in the global coordinates is the intersection with surfaces of constant @xmath37 . from , we see that for these cross - sections @xmath159 is given by @xmath160 so the area is @xmath161 which grows logarithmically at large @xmath37 .    to translate the variation of the area into a statement of the boundary field theory entropy",
    ", we could consider pulling back the area element of the spatial sections of the horizon along radially ingoing null geodesics , as advocated in @xcite .",
    "this would relate the cross - sections at constant @xmath37 to some set of spacelike slices in the field theory on minkowski space .",
    "however , it seems more natural to look at slices of constant poincar time @xmath105 , as this is the natural time coordinate from the field theory point of view .",
    "we would therefore like to check that the area of cross - sections of constant poincar time exhibits a similar behaviour .    .",
    "we have plotted here the situation for a sampling of btz horizon size . as explained in the text , as @xmath162 ( recall that we normalize @xmath163 ) the allowed domain in @xmath134 shrinks exponentially . ]",
    "we have parameterized the event horizon by @xmath164 and @xmath165 in .",
    "in addition the slices of constant poincar time are given explicitly in the second equation of .",
    "these three relations can be solved to find the desired cross - sections of the horizon . in particular , along the line of caustics , the poincar time is given by @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are given in .",
    "we can then determine @xmath169 on a cross - section of the horizon at constant poincar time by choosing @xmath170 and solving this equation for @xmath134 .",
    "since it is a complicated transcendental expression , it will not be possible to solve it analytically .",
    "however , we can make some general remarks .",
    "the slices @xmath171 in poincar coordinates and @xmath172 in global coordinates coincide .",
    "hence , the @xmath6 cross - section of the horizon is the same as the @xmath124 cross - section , and hence has @xmath173 .",
    "further , the slices of @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) lie entirely in the region @xmath176 ( @xmath175 ) in the global coordinates , while the curve of caustics lies only in the region @xmath177 . hence for any slice with @xmath178 , @xmath173 .",
    "all of these slices hence have the same logarithmically divergent area . for the slices with @xmath179 , the area increases monotonically , diverging as @xmath180 .",
    "thus , in this slicing as well , we see a logarithmic divergence of the area ; the potentially surprising feature is that this divergence occurs at @xmath6 in this slicing .",
    "is special , which is rather surprising given that the cft state evolves smoothly through @xmath6 , this is really an artifact of our slicing .",
    "albeit natural , the constant @xmath105 slices of are by no means unique ; had we picked the bulk slice anchored at @xmath6 on the boundary to pass through negative @xmath10 in the bulk , we would see the area divergence at a later @xmath105 . ]",
    "furthermore , @xmath181 is constrained to be greater than @xmath143 determined earlier in .",
    "this is because the poincar slice extends only down to @xmath182 ( the past poincar edge ) and not all the way down to @xmath183 .",
    "in particular , this implies that even for @xmath184 the area of the cs event horizon , whilst finite , is nevertheless larger than the area of the event horizon for the global black hole .",
    "thus , we have seen that the area of the cross - sections of the global event horizon in the cs spacetime increases with time , with a logarithmic divergence .",
    "this implies that we can not identify it with the entropy in the dual field theory . in the field theory ,",
    "passing from the global btz black hole to the cs spacetime is just a conformal transformation , and the entropy of the fluid is invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "thus , we expect the total entropy of the fluid flow corresponding to the cs spacetime to be the same as in the static fluid dual to the global btz black hole , independent of the spatial slice on the boundary we choose to measure it on .",
    "the point is that although the dual fluid flow is time - dependent , it is an ideal fluid , and in the absence of any viscous or dissipative effects we can not have any entropy production ( for a brief review see ) . as a result",
    "we should have the field theory entropy being constant even in the cs spacetime .",
    "we are thus led to propose that in dynamical spacetimes with ` significant ' time variations , one should not associate the area of the event horizon to the entropy of the dual field theory .",
    "this point of view seems natural from studies of entanglement entropy in ads / cft @xcite and also in dynamical black hole spacetimes which are out of the hydrodynamic regime @xcite .",
    "the physical argument is simply that the event horizon is a teleological object .",
    "we need to know the entire future evolution of the classical geometry in order to determine the location of the horizon .",
    "on the other hand , even in a system perturbed away from equilibrium , one expects that entropy is produced locally , i.e. , it makes sense to extract the entropy in some domain of the fluid by analyzing the local evolution equations .",
    "one should not have to evolve the fluid globally for all times before inferring the entropy production in some region .",
    "this suggests that in the gravitational description one should look for an appropriate quasi - local horizon whose area we can associate with the entropy .",
    "we will argue that in the cs spacetime the relevant object is the apparent horizon .",
    "this might appear to contradict the argument of @xcite where it was proposed that it is the event horizon area that corresponds to the field theory entropy .",
    "however , as discussed in , in that case it was assumed that the fluid settles down at late times to a stationary solution , which is not the case for the cs spacetime .",
    "indeed if the dissipative physics drives the evolution then we expect that at late times the event horizon coincides with the apparent horizon , and moreover for slow variations which are required for the hydrodynamic description this situation will pertain for all times .",
    "however , the cs spacetime does nt fit into the slow variation paradigm despite the ideal fluid description and hence leads to a distinct behaviour of event and apparent horizons .",
    "we have seen that the event horizon in the cs geometry deviates significantly from the global event horizon , because of the restriction to @xmath89 .",
    "we would now like to see where the apparent horizon in the cs geometry lies . as the apparent horizon is a more local concept",
    ", we might expect it to be less affected by the boundary restriction , and this is indeed what we find .",
    "the notion of apparent horizon is intimately tied to the notion of trapped surfaces .",
    "recall that a closed , co - dimension two spacelike surface @xmath185 ( which for the cs@xmath186 geometry is just a closed curve ) is trapped if both ( ingoing and outgoing ) future - directed null geodesic congruences emanating normal to the surface @xmath185 have negative expansions , i.e.  the areas of the ` wavefronts ' for these null congruences decrease in time .",
    "physically , the presence of such a trapped surface indicates a region of strong gravitational effects , since ordinarily , e.g.  in flat spacetime or ads , the ingoing congruence contracts but the outgoing congruence expands .",
    "indeed , for spacetimes with complete scri satisfying certain positive energy conditions , any trapped surface must be contained within a black hole .",
    "moreover , the existence of a trapped surface implies the existence of a spacetime singularity .",
    "a surface is marginally trapped if the outgoing null congruence has zero expansion , while the ingoing congruence has negative expansion .",
    "there are several ( strictly - speaking distinct ) notions of  apparent horizon \" . in the numerical relativity community , an apparent horizon on a given spacelike slice is defined as the outermost marginally trapped surface on that slice . in mathematical relativity , an apparent horizon",
    "is usually taken to be the boundary of the union of all trapped points ( points lying on a trapped surface ) , again on a given spacelike slice . however ,",
    "subject to certain smoothness conditions , which are satisfied by our cs spacetime , the apparent horizon so defined does indeed have vanishing outgoing expansion @xcite .",
    "the important subtlety to note about both of these definitions is that a given spacetime geometry does not by itself specify the location of the apparent horizon ; we first need to specify a foliation of the spacetime , with respect to which we can then define the apparent horizon . in the present case ,",
    "the physically relevant foliation is one corresponding to constant poincar time slices .",
    "we could now proceed to find the apparent horizon by an explicit computation ( see ) .",
    "however , this is a difficult calculation , so it is better to argue on general grounds .",
    "since the spacetime satisfies the energy conditions and has a complete @xmath3 , the apparent horizon on any spacelike slice must lie inside or on the event horizon .",
    "the position of the apparent horizon on any given slice does not depend on the rest of the foliation , so we can view a given constant @xmath105 slice as part of a @xmath105-foliation of the cs , or as part of a foliation of the global btz spacetime ( obtained by translating the given slice by @xmath10 rather than @xmath105 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the relevant event horizon is not the cs event horizon which ` flares out ' , but rather the global event horizon , which stays at constant radius @xmath187 for all times .",
    "this means that the apparent horizon can not lie outside the @xmath188 surface .",
    "since the @xmath6 slice in poincar coordinates coincides with the @xmath124 slice in btz coordinates , where the apparent horizon of the static black hole coincides with its event horizon , we know the apparent horizon on this slice coincides with the global horizon at @xmath188 . furthermore , by the area theorem pertaining to the apparent horizon , this apparent horizon can not recede in the future since its area can not decrease .",
    "this , combined with the previous argument that the apparent horizon can not lie outside the global event horizon , forces the apparent horizon to coincide with the global event horizon for all times , which immediately implies that its area is constant .",
    "the above argument is confirmed by an explicit calculation of the expansion of the null normals in .",
    "since the area of the apparent horizon is constant , it can be identified with the entropy of the dual field theory .",
    "this example thus provides strong evidence that the entropy of the field theory fluid should in general be identified with the area of the apparent horizon rather than that of the event horizon .",
    "the large difference between the event horizon and the apparent horizon in this spacetime arises from the global structure  specifically the restriction to @xmath89 .",
    "this indicates that it is the teleological nature of the event horizon which makes it inappropriate for a dual description of the field theory entropy .",
    "the apparent horizon , like the entropy , is determined by considering the situation at a moment in time ( on a single spacelike slice ) .",
    "furthermore , subject to the appropriate energy conditions being satisfied the apparent horizon also respects the second law , i.e. , the area along cross - sectional slices of the apparent horizon is constrained to be non - decreasing .",
    "hence , it is appropriate to use the pull - back of the area of the apparent horizon to the boundary and regard it as a boltzmann h - function .",
    "in this paper we have discussed two distinct hydrodynamic solutions from a gravitational viewpoint .",
    "we analyzed the global causal properties of the spacetimes dual to bjorken flow and the conformal soliton flow .",
    "our bulk analysis confirms that both these spacetimes fit into the fluid - gravity paradigm , albeit in a somewhat novel fashion .    the first one , the boost invariant bjorken flow , was shown to have a regular event horizon and is a genuine regular black hole spacetime .",
    "our analysis here relied on explicitly constructing the null generators of the event horizon order by order in the late time expansion , consistent with the perturbation expansion of the gravity solution .",
    "this provides a final consistency check of the late time expansion as a gradient expansion used in the hydrodynamic context .",
    "our second example , the conformal soliton flow , which from the bulk standpoint might seem more prosaic , in fact proved more interesting .",
    "the solution was just a coordinate transformation of a known static solution , the black hole .",
    "however , here we encountered a surprising result for the event horizon as seen by an observer living in the boundary minkowski space .",
    "we constructed the event horizon by explicitly delineating the boundary of the past of @xmath89 , the future infinity accessible to such a boundary observer .",
    "while @xmath89 is not a complete future null infinity , it is of relevance in the field theory ( or hydrodynamic ) description .",
    "we can think of the event horizon thus defined as the poincar horizon for the black hole spacetime .",
    "it is a dynamical null hypersurface , whose spatial cross - section area diverges logarithmically for positive poincar times .",
    "we then argued that for sensible foliations of the spacetime , including the constant poincar time slices , the apparent horizon on the slices will coincide with the global btz event horizon at @xmath121 .",
    "this example shows that in strongly time - dependent settings , it is the apparent horizon , not the event horizon , which encodes the field theory entropy in the gravitational dual .",
    "one might have thought that the event horizon demarcates the region of spacetime that the asymptotic ( or boundary ) observer can see and therefore its area should encode the number of active degrees of freedom that are relevant for the field theory dynamics and hence is a measure of entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "the event horizon is teleological as its determination requires knowledge of the entire future evolution of the spacetime .",
    "thus by using its area as a measure of entropy we would be predicting a drastic non - locality in the field theory dynamics .",
    "we therefore argue that we should instead use the area of the apparent horizon as a measure for the entropy of the field theory .",
    "let us briefly revisit the issue of foliation - dependence of apparent horizons . in a case of genuinely dynamical spacetimes where the apparent horizon is a dynamical ( spacelike ) horizon ,",
    "general foliations which do nt respect spherical symmetry generically lead to distinct apparent horizons .",
    "one might expect this to be the case even for static black holes , since certain sufficiently bizarre slicings can remove the apparent horizon entirely ( as demonstrated for the schwarzschild black hole by @xcite )",
    ". one might therefore think that by continuity any non - spherical slicing would deform the position of the apparent horizon .",
    "however , this is not the case for static black holes . above",
    "we have argued that in the poincare slicing , the apparent horizon of the cs geometry coincides with the global event horizon at @xmath188 ; but our argument did not depend on any specifics of the slicing .",
    "in fact , for _ any _ foliation which admits a complete slice of the global event horizon , it is easy to show that the apparent horizon must coincide with the global event horizon .",
    "this can of course be confirmed by explicit calculation of the expansion ; but a much simpler argument is presented in .",
    "the way that the example of @xcite gets around this is that their slicing does not allow a complete slice of the future event horizon .",
    "this result is consistent with our expectations from the field theory : for time - dependence which is trivial in this sense , the entropy should not change .    on the other hand , for genuinely dynamical situations , where the geometry has no killing horizons , one might worry that the location , and thereby the area , of the apparent horizon is foliation - dependent .",
    "a - priori , this is not necessarily inconsistent with the field theory expectations : different boundary slicings may lead to different entropy because the field theory state at different times is different .",
    "nevertheless , this intriguing picture of apparent horizon area giving the entropy of the boundary state still leaves more to be understood in the genuinely dynamical context : on the one hand , the area of a particular slice of the apparent horizon depends on where the slice intersects the horizon  for expanding apparent horizon , slices intersecting the horizon at later times will have larger areas . on the other hand , in the boundary theory , the entropy should depend only on the state at a particular boundary time - slice ( not necessarily constant poincare time , but at the same time not be dependent on the behaviour of the bulk slice away from the boundary ) .",
    "this seems to imply that our bulk prescription has more freedom or ambiguity in defining the entropy than that afforded by the boundary theory .",
    "one possibility is that there is a preferred foliation of the bulk , such as a zero - mean - curvature slicing , on which one is supposed to evaluate the area .",
    "however , we do nt have a good physical justification for this option . a simpler resolution to this puzzle",
    "is that in the regime where the concept of entropy is meaningful , the horizon has to be evolving slowly enough that there is negligible difference between the areas of all slices of horizon which end on the same boundary time - slice .",
    "this is essentially the same picture as that advocated in @xcite , except that here we use it for apparent horizon rather than the event horizon . in effect",
    "the field theory on the boundary should achieve local equilibrium in order for entropy to be a meaningful observable .",
    "a general lesson from this discussion seems to be that while in situations near equilibrium , the event and apparent horizons are reasonably close and therefore provide adequate diagnostic measures for the field theory entropy , in far - from - equilibrium scenarios or those with strong modifications to the boundary conditions , we should use the quasi - local apparent horizon as opposed to the event horizon to measure the entropy .",
    "it would be interesting to establish this for generic situations in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "[ [ note - added - in - v2 ] ] note added in v2 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have been rather glib in our terminology , mainly because the context in which we are working is sufficiently mild .",
    "technically speaking , what we called  apparent horizon \" should really be referred to as  dynamical horizon \" ( in case of a spacelike co - dimension 1 surface ) , or  isolated horizon \" ( in case of a null surface ) .",
    "the bf spacetime exemplifies the former , which is the more generic case , whereas the cs spacetime gives the latter .",
    "we should emphasize that generally an apparent horizon is defined as a co - dimension 2 surface , on a given leaf of foliation , corresponding to the outermost marginally trapped surface or the boundary of trapped points , and as such , the set of apparent horizons on all leaves of the foliation need not form a smooth co - dimension 1 surface in the full spacetime .",
    "this supplies further reason why one can not assert that  entropy is given by the area of apparent horizon \" in full generality , since the entropy is expected to be smoothly varying in time , whereas the area of apparent horizon can jump discontinuously .",
    "we would however view the foliation - dependence to be a more worrying issue , as explained in the discussion above , since it arises under much milder conditions than the actual discontinuities in apparent horizon .",

    "this is of course as expected , an ideal fluid stays ideal in all conformal frames . while we have worked out the result for the btz spacetime , it is easy to check that the same result holds in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact from the discussion in it is clear that the transverse @xmath193 symmetry of the @xmath196 ensures that we are essentially dealing with very similar physics .",

    "we conclude then that , since no trapped surface can reach outside @xmath121 , whereas the circle @xmath258 is marginally trapped , the curve @xmath261 gives the apparent horizon .",
    "therefore , we have argued that in the @xmath6 slice of the conformal soliton geometry , the apparent horizon coincides with the global event horizon .

    "we compute the expansion of these outgoing null normals for our test circles lying in the vicinity of the global event horizon , i.e. , @xmath271 . assuming furthermore that @xmath272 and its derivatives are sufficiently smooth at @xmath121",

    "therefore , we conclude that the surface @xmath121 is indeed trapped for general slicings of the spacetime .",
    "recall that for general dynamical black hole spacetimes , the location of an apparent horizon is foliation dependent . changing",
    "the foliation slightly will in general change the location of the apparent ( or the so - called dynamical ) horizon slightly .",
    "however , this is not the case for stationary black holes , or more generally black holes which have a killing horizon .",
    "( note that for stationary black holes , the event horizon is a killing horizon . ) in this appendix we will explain why an apparent horizon of a spacetime with compact killing horizon must coincide with the killing horizon for _ any _ foliation which allows complete sections of the killing horizon .",
    "the basic outline of the argument is the following : any slice of a killing horizon is a marginally trapped surface , since the outgoing null normals to any such slice of the horizon coincide with the horizon generators ( due to the killing horizon being null ) , and the horizon generators have zero expansion ( because any spacelike slice of a killing horizon has the same proper area ) .",
    "moreover , this marginally trapped surface is the outermost one , since there can not be trapped surfaces outside the event horizon .",
    "hence for a slicing which admits a complete cross - section of the ( future ) event horizon , the apparent horizon necessarily coincides with the event horizon .",
    "let us now demonstrate the assertion that any complete slice of a killing horizon is a marginally trapped surface using the example of 3-dimensional rotationally - invariant black hole .",
    "we proceed by first describing an arbitrary spacelike slice of the horizon in terms of its tangent vector , and then determining the null normals to this vector .",
    "having obtained the null normals , we can then easily confirm that the outgoing null normal coincides with the horizon generators .",
    "since we wish to consider the geometry at the event horizon , let us write the metric more conveniently in ingoing eddington coordinates : @xmath274 where the metric components @xmath275 and @xmath276 are functions of @xmath37 which we do nt need to specify for our argument .",
    "suppose the event horizon lies on a constant @xmath37 surface , @xmath188 , where @xmath277 .",
    "then along any spacelike slice of the horizon , we can write the tangent vector as @xmath278 for some arbitrary coefficient @xmath260 ( which can vary along the slice ) . in order",
    "for @xmath279 to be unit - normalised , it suffices to let @xmath280 .",
    "now , to solve for the null normal to our slice , we want to find a vector @xmath281 which satisfies @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "let @xmath284 then the null condition @xmath282 implies @xmath285 , while the normal condition @xmath283 yields @xmath286 .",
    "for any given @xmath260 , there exist two distinct solutions : either @xmath287 or @xmath288 since in the latter solution , , the coefficient @xmath289 of @xmath290 is negative , the resulting @xmath281 corresponds to ingoing null normals .",
    "this means that the first solution , , corresponds to the outgoing null normals .",
    "thus we have found that for an arbitrary slice of the horizon , i.e.  for any @xmath289 , the outgoing null normal is given by @xmath291 , independently of @xmath289 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath292 is a killing vector , the killing horizon generators are simply @xmath292 , which are null on the horizon .",
    "this proves our first assertion , that the outgoing null normals to any slice of the killing horizon coincide with the horizon generators .",
    "finally , the fact that the killing horizon generators have zero expansion can be easily shown by noting that the proper area of the horizon remains constant along the generators , and moreover using similar arguments as above , this area is the same along any spacelike slice of the horizon ; we leave this as an exercise for the reader .",
