    "market conditions evolve over time , and information that is privately available to a market participant is a valuable asset . in this paper",
    "we study the optimal provision of information by an informed `` expert '' with no decision power , to an uninformed agent in a dynamic setup .",
    "we develop a stylized model in which an  investor \" chooses at each date whether or not to choose a risky action , such as a short - run investment .",
    "the payoff from investing depends on some underlying state of nature , which is unknown to the investor .",
    "this state accounts for all relevant external factors and evolves exogenously according to a markov chain .    at each date",
    ", the investor may get information through the advisor .",
    "how much information is being disclosed is the choice variable of the advisor . to be specific",
    ", the advisor publicly chooses an information provision rule , which maps each history into a distribution over signals .",
    "the investor observes both the rule chosen by the advisor and the realized signal .",
    "we assume that the advisor receives a fixed fee whenever investment takes place , and that the investor invests whenever the expected net payoff given his current posterior belief is nonnegative .",
    "this allows us to recast the problem faced by the advisor as a markov decision problem ( mdp ) in which the state space is the compact set of posterior beliefs of the investor , and the action space is the set of information provision rules . in that mdp , the advisor chooses dynamically the provision of information so as to maximize the ( expected ) discounted frequency of dates in which investment takes place .",
    "advising is thus both honest , in that realized signals can not be manipulated , and strategic , in that the information content of the signal is strategic .",
    "there are two ( mutually exclusive ) interpretations that befit this description . in the first one ,",
    "the advisor does not observe the underlying state , and chooses how much information will be publicly obtained .",
    "in other words , he chooses a statistical experiment _  la _ blackwell , whose outcome is public . in the second interpretation ,",
    "the advisor does observe the successive states of nature but commits _ ex ante _ to a dynamic information provision policy .",
    "the basic trade - off faced by the advisor is the following . by disclosing information at a given date , the advisor may increase his payoff at that date , but then gives up part of his information advantage for later dates , as soon as successive states are autocorrelated .",
    "our focus is on structural properties of the model .",
    "characterizing optimal information provision in general is out - of - reach , and we instead focus on the optimality of rules in which the above trade - off is solved in a very simple way .",
    "we define the greedy policy as the one that , at any given date , minimizes the amount of information being disclosed , subject to the current payoff of the advisor being maximized .",
    "we prove that this policy is optimal in the case of two states of nature .",
    "we then exhibit a class of markov chains , described by a renewal property , for which this policy is optimal for a large range of initial distributions of the state ( including most natural ones ) , and is eventually optimal , for any initial distribution of the state .",
    "our main message is thus that this policy is likely to perform very well in a large number of cases , but not always , as we show by means of a counterexample .",
    "our modelling of information acquisition / disclosure is a dynamic version of the persuasion mechanisms of kamenica and gentskow ( 2011 ) who study optimal signals in a broader , yet static , setup .",
    "it also parallels the independent paper by ely ( 2014 ) .",
    "our paper joins the growing literature on dynamic models in which uncertainty evolves , see , e.g. , mailath and samuelson ( 2001 ) , phelan ( 2006 ) , wiseman ( 2008 ) , or athey and bagwell ( 2008 ) , and escobar and toikka ( 2013 ) for economic applications .",
    "these references focus on game models , whose mathematical analysis is in general quite challenging , see renault ( 2006 ) and hrner et al .",
    "although our basic model is a game - theoretic one , its reduced form , and the commitment assumption makes it more comparable to contract theory ones , see e.g. battaglini ( 2005 ) , zhang and zenios ( 2008 ) or zhang , nagarajan and sosic ( 2008 ) .",
    "we consider the following stylized class of two - player games between an `` advisor '' ( player  1 ) and an `` investor '' ( player  2 ) .",
    "the advisor observes a stochastic process @xmath0 with values in a finite set of states @xmath1 , and may provide the investor with information regarding the current or past values of the process . in each round , the investor chooses whether to invest or not .",
    "the investor s payoff from investing in round @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "the advisor receives a fee whenever investment takes place ( this fee is already accounted for in @xmath5 ) and discounts future payoffs according to a discount factor @xmath6 .    while the investor knows the law of the sequence @xmath7 , he receives no information on the realized states , except through the advisor .",
    "it is then natural to assume that he chooses to invest whenever his expected ( net ) payoff from investing is nonnegative , where the expectation is computed using the information released by the advisor.@xmath8 thus , the game reduces to a stochastic optimization problem , in which the advisor chooses whether and how to reveal information to the investor , so as to maximize the expected discounted frequency of rounds in which investment takes place .",
    "we assume that the process @xmath7 follows an irreducible markov chain with transition matrix @xmath9 and invariant measure @xmath10 .",
    "the set @xmath11 is the set of probability distributions over @xmath1 , whose elements are potential `` beliefs '' of the investor . throughout , we identify each @xmath12 with a unit basis vector in @xmath13 , and @xmath11 with the @xmath14-dimensional unit simplex in @xmath13 , endowed with the induced topology .",
    "the game is played as follows . in each round @xmath2 , the state @xmath15 is drawn according to @xmath16 , the advisor observes @xmath15 and chooses which message to send to the investor ; the investor next chooses whether to invest , and the game moves to the next round .. we will show that w.l.o.g .",
    "two messages suffice .",
    "] when the investor s belief is @xmath17 , his expected net payoff from investing is given by the scalar product @xmath18 .",
    "accordingly , the _ investment region _ is @xmath19 and the _ investment frontier _ is @xmath20 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath21 the _ noninvestment _ region .    throughout , we will denote by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the states with nonnegative and negative payoff respectively , so that @xmath24 and @xmath25 form a partition of @xmath1 .    an _ information disclosure policy _ for the advisor specifies for each round , the probability law of the message being sent in that round , as a function of previous messages and the information privately available to the advisor , that is , past and current states .",
    "we will assume that the advisor has _",
    "commitment power_. to be specific , we assume that in any given round , the investor knows which disclosure policy was used in that round , and therefore knows unambiguously how to interpret the message received from the advisor .    an equivalent and alternative interpretation is to assume that the advisor does _ not _ observe the process @xmath7 and chooses in each round a statistical experiment _  la _ blackwell .",
    "such an experiment yields a random outcome , whose distribution is contingent on the current state . under this alternative interpretation",
    ", the advisor has no private information , but by choosing the experiment , he effectively determines how much information is being publicly obtained , and the investor observes both the experiment choice and the outcome of the experiment .",
    "given an information disclosure policy , the investor uses the successive messages received from the advisor to update his belief on the current state .",
    "we find it convenient to distinguish the beliefs @xmath26 and @xmath27 held in round @xmath2 , respectively _ before _ and _ after _ receiving the message of the advisor .",
    "formally , @xmath26 is the conditional law of @xmath15 given the messages received prior to round @xmath2 , while @xmath27 is the updated belief , once the round @xmath2 message has been received , so that the investor invests in round @xmath2 if and only if @xmath28 .",
    "the beliefs @xmath27 and @xmath29 differ because the state evolves : @xmath15 and @xmath30 need not be equal , and one has @xmath31 .",
    "the difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the result of the information provided by the advisor .    for a given @xmath17 , denote by @xmath32 the set of probability distributions over @xmath11 with mean @xmath33 .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the distribution over @xmath11 that assigns probability 1 to @xmath33 .    as a consequence of bayesian updating",
    ", the ( conditional ) law @xmath35 of @xmath27 belongs to @xmath36 , for every information disclosure policy .",
    "conversely , a classical result from the literature of repeated games with incomplete information ( see aumann and maschler ( 1995 ) has a finite support .",
    "their proof readily extends to the case in which the support of @xmath35 is general . ] ) states that the converse also holds .",
    "that is , given any distribution @xmath17 and any distribution @xmath37 of beliefs with mean @xmath33 , the advisor can correlate the message with the state in such a way that the investor s updated belief is distributed according to @xmath35 .",

    "the set of available actions is the set @xmath38 , so that the advisor chooses a distribution @xmath35 of posterior beliefs that is consistent with @xmath33 .",
    "given the posterior belief @xmath42 , the current payoff is 1 if @xmath43 and 0 if @xmath44 , and the next state in @xmath39 is @xmath45 .",

    "the value function @xmath48 is characterized as the unique solution of the dynamic programming equation on the right - hand side because it is readily checked that @xmath48 is lipschitz over @xmath11 , the expression between braces is upper hemi - continuous w.r.t .",

    "we will point at two such implications which are especially useful in the sequel .",
    "[ lemm1 ] the function @xmath48 is concave on @xmath11 .",
    "this is a standard result in the literature on zero - sum games with incomplete information , see , e.g. , sorin ( 2002 , proposition 2.2 ) .",
    "while the setup here is different , the proof follows the same logic , and we only sketch it .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath51 whenever @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "starting from @xmath33 , consider the following strategy @xmath55 for the advisor . pick first the element @xmath37 that assigns probabilities @xmath56 and @xmath57 to @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , and next follow an optimal strategy in @xmath60 or @xmath61 , depending on the outcome of @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the advisor s behavior at @xmath33 is a so - called _ compound lottery _ obtained as the result of first using @xmath35 , and then the first choice of an optimal strategy in either @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "the strategy @xmath55 yields at @xmath33 a payoff equal to @xmath62 , hence the result .",
    "the first consequence of lemma [ lemm1 ] is that the advisor does not reveal information when the investor s belief is in the investment region .",
    "[ cor1 ] at any @xmath63 , it is optimal for the advisor not to provide information to the investor .",
    "that is , the distribution @xmath64 that assigns probability one to @xmath33 achieves the maximum in ( [ equ1 ] ) .",
    "the intuition is as follows .",
    "when @xmath65 , revealing information can not increase the current payoff , and therefore , such revelation may only possibly be beneficial in subsequent stages .",
    "however , every information that is disclosed today could instead be revealed tomorrow , so that there is no reason to provide information to the investor when @xmath65 .",
    "note that we do not rule out the possibility that there are _ additional _ optimal strategies that do reveal information in @xmath66 .",
    "fix @xmath37 . by the concavity of the function @xmath67 and jensen s inequality",
    ", one has @xmath68\\leq",
    "v_\\delta(\\phi({{{\\bf e}}}_\\mu[q]))=v_\\delta(\\phi(p)),\\ ] ] with equality for @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 can not exceed 1 , and is equal to 1 for @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the right - hand side in ( [ equ1 ] ) is at most @xmath70 , and this upper bound is achieved for @xmath69 .",
    "a second corollary of lemma [ lemm1 ] states that in the investment region , the advisor can restrict himself to splitting the investor s belief among at most two beliefs .",
    "[ cor2 ] at any @xmath71 , there is an optimal choice @xmath37 , which is carried by at most two points .",
    "that is , at each @xmath71 it is either optimal not to disclose information , or to disclose information in a coarse way so that the posterior belief of the investor takes only two well - chosen values in @xmath11 .",
    "this result hinges on the fact that ( i ) the advisor s stage payoff assumes two values only , and ( ii ) the investment region @xmath66 is convex .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath37 be arbitrary .",
    "assume first that @xmath72 and compare the distribution @xmath35 to the distribution @xmath73 in which no information is revealed .",
    "the two distributions yield the same current payoff , because @xmath74 .",

    "this proves the result .",
    "note that it may still be optimal not to disclose information at @xmath77 .",
    "this is in particular the case whenever @xmath90 .",
    "the intuition behind corollaries [ cor1 ] and [ cor2 ] above is clear . when @xmath63 , no information should be revealed , because it can not help to increase the current payoff , and can only hurt continuation values . when @xmath71 , there are two conflicting effects at play . for",
    "the sake of maximizing payoffs , the advisor should release information .",
    "but releasing information may only hurt continuation payoffs , because of concavity .",
    "corollary [ cor2 ] shows qualitatively ( but not explicitly ) how to compromise between the two effects .",
    "the main message of our results is that in many cases but not all , the explicit compromise is simple : the advisor should minimize the amount of information released , subject to current payoffs being maximal .",
    "we define accordingly the _ greedy strategy _ @xmath91 as follows .",
    "[ def_greedy ] the _ greedy strategy _ for the advisor is the strategy @xmath91 that depends on the investor s current belief @xmath33 , and plays as follows :    g1 : :    at any @xmath63 , the strategy @xmath91    discloses no information .",

    "thus , the greedy strategy is stationary in the investor s belief , which can be computed by the advisor using the investor s initial belief @xmath40 and the messages sent to the investor in earlier rounds .",
