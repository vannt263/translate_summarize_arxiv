    "determining the properties of deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the main challenges of strong - interaction physics both theoretical and experimental .",
    "many features of this matter were experimentally discovered at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven .",
    "the most striking result , obtained from analysis of these experimental data @xcite , is that the deconfined quark - gluon matter behaves as almost perfect fluid rather than as a perfect gas , as it could be expected from the asymptotic freedom .    from the theory side , the most fundamental way to compute properties of strongly interacting matter",
    "is provided by lattice qcd , see the recent review @xcite .",
    "interpretation of these computations requires application of various qcd motivated , albeit schematic , models simulating various aspects of the full theory and allowing for a deeper physical understanding .",
    "the above mentioned strongly correlated behavior of the qgp is expected to show up in long - ranged spatial correlations of quarks and gluons which , in fact , may give rise to liquid - like and , possibly , solid - like structures .",
    "this expectation is based on very similar behavior observed in electrodynamic plasmas , as was pointed out e.g. in refs .",
    "this similarity has been exploited to formulate classical non - relativistic models of a color coulomb interacting qgp @xcite which is numerically analyzed by classical molecular dynamics simulations . while this has allowed to incorporate nonideality effects , quantum effects were either neglected or included phenomenologically via a short - range repulsive correction to the pair potential , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , such a rough model may become a critical issue at higher densities where quantum and fermi statistics effects of the quarks should have a strong influence on the properties of the qgp .",
    "similar models had been used in electrodynamic plasmas and showed poor behavior in the region of strong wave function overlap , in particular at the mott density .",
    "this difficulty can be eliminated by deriving effective quantum potentials , as was shown by some of the present authors before @xcite .",
    "following an idea of kelbg @xcite quantum corrections to the pair potential can be rigorously derived in perturbation theory with respect to the coupling parameter @xcite . to extend the method of quantum potentials to larger coupling an `` improved kelbg potential ''",
    "was derived which contains a single free parameter which is fitted to the exact solution of the quantum - mechanical two - body problem and exactly reproduces the thermodynamic properties up to moderate couplings @xcite . however",
    ", this approach may fail if the system forms bound states of more than two particles leading to a break - down of the pair approximation for the density matrix , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "a superior approach which does not have these limitations , is to use the original kelbg potential in path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations which effectively map the problem onto a high - temperature weakly coupled and weakly degenerate one .",
    "this allows one to rigorously extend the analysis to strong couplings and is , therefore , the method of choice for the present purpose . beside the nonideality and quantum effects our approach takes into account the effects of the fermi ( bose ) statistics of quarks ( gluons ) by a proper antisymmetrization ( symmetrization ) of the @xmath2body density matrix . for temperature and density of the qgp considered in this paper which are similar to the conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite these effects are very important as the quasiparticle thermal wave length is larger than the average interparticle distance .",
    "this is , in particular , important for the behavior of the pair distribution functions ( see below ) .",
    "here , we develop a pimc approach to the strongly coupled qgp which takes the fermi ( bose ) statistics of quarks ( gluons ) and quantum degeneracy selfconsistently into account .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to strongly coupled electrodynamic plasmas before , e.g. @xcite .",
    "examples are partially ionized dense hydrogen plasmas where liquid - like and crystalline behavior was observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , also partial ionization effects and pressure ionization could be studied from first principles @xcite .",
    "the same methods have been applied also to electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors @xcite , including excitonic bound states , which have many similarities to the qgp due to the smaller mass differences as compared to electron - ion plasmas .    in this paper",
    "we present first exploratory pimc simulations of a nonideal quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the main goal is to test this approach for ability to reproduce the equation of state known from lattice data @xcite . to this end",
    "we use the simplest model of a qgp consisting of quarks , antiquarks and gluons interacting via a color coulomb potential due to gelman et al .",
    "@xcite with several approximations for the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle masses .",
    "we report surprisingly good agreement with the lattice data for one of the parameter sets , which gives us confidence that the model correctly captures main properties of the nonideal qgp .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ s : discussion ] with a discussion of the results together with an outlook on further improvements of the approach .",
    "our model is based on precisely the same assumptions as those in ref .",
    "@xcite which are summarized as follows :    i : :    all particles ( quarks and gluons ) are heavy , i.e. ,    @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of a particle    and @xmath5 the temperature and , therefore , they move    non - relativistically . this assumption is based on the analysis of    lattice data @xcite .",
    "ii : :    since the order of magnitude of quark and gluon masses , deduced from    the lattice data @xcite is the same , we do not distinguish    these masses and put them equal .",
    "moreover , because of the latter we do    not distinguish between quark flavors .",
    "iii : :    the interparticle interaction is dominated by a color - electric coulomb    interaction , see eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) .",
    "magnetic effects are neglected as    sub - leading ones , in the nonrelavistic limit .",
    "iv : :    the color operators @xmath6 are substituted by their average    values , i.e. by classical color vectors , relying on the fact that the    color representations are large .    the quality of these approximations and their limitations were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "aiming at a first test of this model in pimc simulations , in this paper , we are going to consider the qgp only at zero baryon density .",
    "therefore , this model requires the following quantities as an input :    1 .   the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle mass , @xmath7 , 2 .   the density of particles , @xmath8 , at a given temperature , following @xcite , where we assume that the numbers of quarks , antiquarks and gluons are approximately equal , 3 .",

    "we introduced the kinetic and color coulomb interaction energy of the quasiparticles @xmath17 here the @xmath18 denote wong s color variables which are @xmath19 unit vectors , and the constants @xmath20 are products of eigenvalues of the casimir operator @xcite : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",

    "of course , the exact density matrix of interacting quantum systems is not known ( particularly for low temperatures and high densities ) , but it can be constructed using a path integral approach based on the operator identity @xmath39 , where the r.h.s . contains @xmath40 identical factors with @xmath41 , which allows us to rewrite the integral in eq .",

    "the main contributions to the partition function come from configurations in which the ` size ' of the cloud of beads of quasiparticles is of the order of their thermal wavelength , whereas typical distances between beads of each quasiparticle are of the order of the wavelength taken at the @xmath58-times higher temperature @xmath59 . to determine the pressure or total energy in the path integral representation  ( [ rho - pimc ] ) each high - temperature density matrix has to be differentiated in turn according to expressions ( [ p_gen ] ) and ( [ e_gen ] ) .",

    "the density matrix ( [ rho_s ] ) has been transformed to a form which does not contain an explicit sum over permutations and thus no sum of terms with alternating sign ( in the case of quarks and antiquarks ) .",

    "however , there is a drastic difference in the behavior of the pdf of quarks and gluons ( the anti - quark pdf is identical to the quark pdf ) and small distances . while the gluon pdf increase monotonically when the distance goes to zero , the pdf of quarks ( and antiquarks ) exhibits a broad minimum .",
    "this difference can be understood by spin statistics effects .",
    "in fact , for the present conditions , the de broglie wavelength @xmath108 equals approximately @xmath109 , i.e. the different behavior of gluons and quarks starts to appear at distances smaller than @xmath110 .",
    "the enhanced population of low distance states of gluons is due to bosonic exchange and color coulomb attraction , see below .",
    "in contrast , the depletion of small distance states of quarks is a consequence of the pauli principle . in an ideal fermi gas",

    "the spin averaged pdf approaches @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "this low - distance behavior is also observed in a nonideal dense astrophysical electron - ion plasma and in nonideal a electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the value we observe for the quark - quark pdf at small distances which we , therefore , attribute to the pauli principle .",
    "an exception is the behavior at very small distances , @xmath114 .",
    "also , the abrupt increase of @xmath115 around @xmath116 is a - typical compared to electrodynamic plasmas .",
    "we , therefore expect that this behavior is caused by the particular properties of the color coulomb interaction .",
    "let us now consider the pdf of different particles , see top right part of fig .  2 . here",

    "a strong increase is observed which resembles the behavior of the gluon - gluon pdf , cf .",
    "top left figure . at larger distances ,",
    "all pdf s equal one .",
    "this increase of the pdf at small distances is a clear manifestation of an effective pair attraction of quarks and antiquarks as well as quarks ( antiquarks ) and gluons .",
    "this may , at first sight , seem surprising because all casimir indices @xmath118 are positive , see above , indicating a repulsive character of the pair potential ( [ coulomb ] )",
    ". however , this potential still contains the scalar product of the color vectors , and the net attraction could be understood if , on average , the color vectors of nearest neighbor quasiparticles of any type are anti - parallel .",
    "this hypothesis is readily verified from the pimc simulation data . to this end",
    ", we define the _ color pair distribution function _ ( cpdf ) by generalizing the definition ( [ g - def ] ) according to @xmath119 which is straightforwardly computed during the pimc simulations together with the traditional pdf .",
    "the results are shown in the lower panel of fig .  2 .",
    "we immediately observe that all cpdf s are negative at small distances indicating anti - parallel orientation of the color vectors of all neighboring quarks ( antiquarks ) and gluons as well as quarks and antiquarks , clearly confirming the origin of the effective quasiparticle attraction seen in the functions @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "we now turn to the cpdf of identical particles , see bottom left figure .",
    "all functions are non - positive everywhere .",
    "the minimum of @xmath122 close to @xmath123 explains the increase of @xmath124 above the value @xmath113 at small distances .",
    "most striking is the deep minimum of the gluon cpdf , @xmath125 , at small distances .",
    "it again confirms the antiparallel arrangement of the color vectors of neighboring gluons whereas the much lower value of the minimum , compared to that of the quark cpdf , is due to the absence of the pauli principle and the larger value of the casimir index @xmath126 compared to @xmath127 .",
    "this deep minimum explains the high maximum of the gluon pdf @xmath128 .",
    "let us summarize the local ordering of the qgp at the temperature @xmath105 .",
    "we observe only weak signs of a spatial ordering , cf .",
    "the peak of the quark pdf around @xmath129 , which may be interpreted as emergence of liquid - like behavior of the qgp .",
    "much more pronounced is the short range structure of nearest neighbors .",
    "the qgp lowers its total energy by minimizing the color coulomb interaction energy via a spontaneous `` anti - ferromagnetic '' ordering of color vectors of gluons .",
    "this gives rise to a clustering of gluons which is accompanied by a weak tendency of clustering of quark pairs with anti - parallel spins .",
    "we also observe clusters of quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "to verify the relevance of these trends a more refined spin - resolved analysis of the pdf and cpdf is necessary , together with simulations in a broader range of temperatures which are presently under way .",
    "experimental data on the quark - gluon plasma and the hadronization transition give rise to numerous challenges to the theory , see , e.g. @xcite and references therein . of particular interest",
    "is the question why the quark - gluon matter behaves as an almost perfect fluid rather than as a perfect gas , as it could be expected from the asymptotic freedom .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations based on the quasiparticle picture with color coulomb interactions help us to answer this question .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the potential energy of the system to the kinetic one , obtained in these simulations , turns out to be in the range from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , depending on the temperature .",
    "this certainly corresponds to a liquid - like rather than a gas - like behavior .",
    "we have shown that the pimc method captures main trends of the equation of state ( even near the critical temperature ) and may also yield valuable insight into the internal structure of the qgp , in particular into the pair correlation functions .",
    "our pimc simulations also allow for a selfconsistent analysis of cluster and bound state formation in the qgp .",
    "similar questions have been successfully studied before in dense astrophysical plasmas @xcite and electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "in fact , first indications for clustering in the qgp have been observed and will be studied in more detail in the future .",
    "the pimc method is not able to yield dynamical and transport properties of the qgp .",
    "one way to achieve this is to develop semiclassical molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "in contrast to previous md simulations where quantum effects were included phenomenologically via a short range potential @xcite a more systematic approach has been developed for electron - ion plasmas @xcite .",
    "there an effective quantum pair potential has been derived from quantum monte carlo data which should also be possible in application to the qgp .",
