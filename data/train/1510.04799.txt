    "the decision making processes at the cellular level are initiated by some specialized signaling networks @xcite .",
    "these networks play a pivotal role in making robust and precise cellular response towards endogenic and exogenic perturbations .",
    "in addition , the process of decision making resolves cellular fate as well as survival strategies in diverse peripheral conditions .",
    "although both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are comprised of several common signaling networks , few signaling networks are incorporated mostly in the eukaryotes due to the evolutionary prospect @xcite .",
    "one such signaling network is the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway that plays the central role to attune with extra - cellular signal in eukaryotic cells @xcite .",
    "although different mapk pathways with diverse inputs and outputs belong to a higher living species , they are sometimes interconnected through overlapping sets of signaling components .",
    "depending on the interconnections , mapk pathways can be classified into different groups that use one or more than one common signaling components .",
    "moreover , as a result of cross - interaction , a single regulon regulates multiple targets in addition to its own target .",
    "such type of signal association is defined as cross - talk .",
    "cross - coupling in the signaling network can modify the functionality of a network topology and can subsume errors compared to the uncoupled one .",
    "cross - interactions have been identified not only in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes , as observed in the bacterial two - component system @xcite . in the eukaryotic system",
    ", cross - talk has been identified in numerous situations@xcite .",
    "furthermore , cross - talk and several of its variance have also been identified at different stages of gene regulation @xcite .    since cross - talk",
    "is observed in a broad range of biological processes , one may interrogate the functional utility of such network coordination .",
    "the cross - coupling mechanism is conveyed through generations despite the continuous development of a large number of evolutionary descent with modifications in the cellular interactions within the surviving trait .",
    "this character indicates that crosstalk might have a definite functional potential to build up synchronized cellular regulations by spending the storage energy .",
    "if this is true , how a cell balances the trade - off between network association and potential cost ?",
    "few comprehensive experiments on the network connectivity suggest that networks of a well delineated cluster are correlated with each other but are uncorrelated to the rest of the network @xcite .",
    "synchronization is necessary to attain natural activity but needs to maintain a threshold value .",
    "otherwise too much synchronization may lead to physiological disorder like epilepsy @xcite .",
    "inter - pathway cross - talk becomes prominent due to limitation of common resources , defined as overloaded condition .",
    "however , cross - talk effect becomes faint in the underloaded condition , where level of available resources is satisfactory @xcite .",
    "a key source of survival strategy under diverse environmental conditions is the generation of fluctuations which induces non - genetic variability in a cellular population .",
    "in such a situation , cells readjust to cope with the limited resources by introducing cross - correlation among a set of genes and thus implementing a successful bet - hedging program @xcite .",
    "cross - talk also facilitates synchronization in different organs such as cardio - respiratory interaction , brain and tissues @xcite .    to address the functionality of cross - talk ,",
    "we undertake a representative cluster of networks with overlapping sets of regulatory components . to be specific , we focus on mapk pathway , a well- studied eukaryotic signaling machinery , conserved with three kinase cascades . in _ s. cerevisiae _ , five mapk signaling pathways are present among which only three ( pheromone response , filamentous growth response and osmostress adaptation ) use a common kinase protein ste11 @xcite .",
    "in fact , pheromone response and filamentous growth pathways also use the same kinase ste7 .",
    "pheromone mapk cascade ( ste11 @xmath0 ste7 @xmath0 fus3 ) is activated by mating pheromone . under low nutrient condition , filamentous growth mapk cascade ( ste11 @xmath0 ste7 @xmath0 kss1)gets activated whereas high external osmolarity activates the osmoadaption cascade ( ste11 @xmath0 pbs2 @xmath0 hog1 ) @xcite .",
    "due to intercascade correlation among the three signaling pathways , one pathway can be activated by the signal of another pathway in absence of its own signal .",
    "several experimental results suggest that such cross - talk is filtered out by cross - pathway inhibition , kinetic insulation and formation of scaffold protein @xcite .",
    "although activation through inter - pathway cross - talk and cross - pathway inhibition compensates each other , information is exchanged among the pathways during these interactions .",
    "this leads to obvious queries  (",
    "i ) is it possible for an individual signaling pathway to convey its input signal reliably downstream without experiencing any influence from the other pathway s signal ?",
    "( ii ) since the inter - pathway connectivity is known not to allow the uniqueness of transduced signals - what are the physiological advantages of cross - association ? ( iii ) is there any participation of pathway output in the cooperative regulation of a downstream target in a synchronized manner ? ( iv ) how is it possible for correlated pathways to keep up static as well as dynamic synchronization in a single cell environment that is prevalently stochastic in nature ? ( v ) does this association have any capability to control the cell - to - cell variability ?    in the present manuscript , we study generic _",
    "s. cerevisiae _ mapk pathways to address the potential functionality of inter - pathway cross - talk within a stochastic framework .",
    "we consider two equivalent interacting mapk pathways , each one consisting of a linear chain of three mapk cascade proteins @xcite .",
    "both pathways get stimulated by their corresponding external signals propagating downstream through phosphorylation ( activation ) and dephosphorylation ( deactivation ) of the cascade proteins .",
    "in addition , due to cross - talk , phosphorylation of the intermediate components of the two pathways is influenced by the activated kinase of the other pathway along with the cognate one . as the population of each cascade protein is not sufficiently high within a single cell and experiences a fluctuating environment , we express all associated chemical reactions in terms of stochastic differential equation .",
    "we solve the coupled set of nonlinear langevin equations using linear noise approximation and calculate the auto variance of each and every kinase and covariance between two different kinases ( see sec .",
    "ii and appendix ) .",
    "linear noise approximation remains valid for high copy number of the system components and faster activation and deactivation ( or synthesis and degradation ) rates of the corresponding components compared to the coarse - grained ( steady state ) time scale @xcite . to classify the signal transduction efficacy through two pathways in the presence of cross - association , we quantify two as well as three variable mutual information .",
    "distributions of all kinase proteins are approximately considered gaussian , allowing us to adopt a reduced expression of mutual information @xcite .",
    "the reduced equation mainly depends on the auto variance and the covariance of the corresponding kinase .",
    "we validate our analytical calculation by exact stochastic simulation @xcite . in the first subsection ,",
    "we quantify two variable mutual information under the influence of cross - talk parameter .",
    "we also investigate the mutual information between two non - cognate kinases and find causality of this coordination . since causality leads to synchronization @xcite .",
    "it is important to measure causality relation between the pathways , i.e. , who regulates whom and to which extent .",
    "if both pathways interact with each other and transduce information of the corresponding input signal with different degrees , then it is very difficult to characterize the magnitude and direction of signal propagation . to overcome such difficulty",
    ", we define a new measure , net information transduction , using the expressions of two cross mutual information , which satisfactorily quantifies the amount of net signal propagation .",
    "we also verify inter - pathway synchronization with the help of coordinated fluctuations of stochastic trajectories of two parallel kinases .",
    "this result implies how two kinases are synchronized within a cell . to understand this phenomenon further",
    ", we investigate how much association is developed among the steady state population of these kinases from cell - to - cell . in the second subsection , we quantify three variable mutual information when both the channels of information flow work separately . applying the theory of partial information decomposition @xcite",
    ", we quantify the net synergy .",
    "we observe the sign of net synergy value changes depending on the signal integration as well as signal bifurcation and is mainly controlled by pathway architecture .",
    "in fig .  1 we show a schematic diagram of two interacting parallel mapk pathways ( named as x and y ) .",

    "the first cascade protein of a mapk pathway gets phosphorylated with an exposure to the external stimulus . while phosphorylated , it positively regulates the phosphorylation of its own downstream kinase along with the kinase of the other pathway .",

    "is propagated from @xmath58 to @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , the motif reduces to a single input - output motif and the motif regains its native form due to the significant contribution of @xmath13 . in fig .  2a",
    ", we show that two variable mutual information between @xmath56 and @xmath57 decreases with the increment of @xmath13 .",
    "similar situation arises in fig .",
    "4a for low value of @xmath13 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath73 increases with the increment of @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "thus , two opposing effects work together to generate the convex profile . in fig .  4b , we plot net synergy of the motif as a function of @xmath13 for a fixed value of @xmath12 and it is seen to increase monotonically .",
    "it is pertinent to mention here that for this motif , one always gets a positive net synergy value as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "this result implies that an integrating signaling motif transduces more information compared to the summation of two isolated channels . the extra information , i.e. , synergy facilitates fidelity of the output kinase .",
    "intuitively , the sum of the reduction in the uncertainty ( cross - correlation ) of the output kinase contributed by each input signal is lower than the reduction in the uncertainty of the output provided by both signals together .",
    "this phenomenon implicates the aspect of integration of multiple signals in cellular signaling network motif as observed in _",
    "v. harveyi _ quorum - sensing circuit @xcite    in fig .  4c",
    ", we show mutual information @xmath100 of one input and two outputs motif with the increment of @xmath13 for a fixed value of @xmath12 .",
    "the mutual information value decreases with @xmath13 since propagation of information from @xmath56 to @xmath57 is only inhibited by the cross - interaction .",
    "however , @xmath13 does not have any influence in information propagation from @xmath56 to @xmath59 and remains unaltered .",
    "thus , three variable mutual information profile follows a decreasing trend .",
    "4d shows decreasing trend of net synergy profile as a function of @xmath13 for a fixed value of @xmath12 .",
    "importantly , for this motif negative values of net synergy are observed irrespective of the value of @xmath21 .",
    "this indicates redundancy in the information transmission in this composite motif compared to the sum of the individual one .",
    "naturally , predictability about the output kinases decreases when two isolated signal propagation channels work together to form a bifurcated signal transduction motif .",
    "this result implies that although bifurcated signaling model reduces mutual information , it has a biological significance of the activation of multiple signaling channels in the presence of a single input as identified in the chemotaxis system of _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite . in all figures ( fig .",
    "4a - 4d ) , the red lines are plotted for faster relaxation rate constants ( table  i ) of @xmath103 and @xmath65 and the green lines are for slower relaxation rate constants ( table  ii ) .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated evolutionarily conserved yeast mapk signaling pathway . in our phenomenological model , we study two parallel mapk signaling pathways where one signaling pathway in addition to its own activates the other pathway through cross - talk with an emphasis to understand the change in the dynamical behavior of the system in the presence of cross - talk at the single cell level .",
    "the model nonlinear langevin equations have been solved under the purview of linear noise approximation to quantify the auto variance and the covariance associated with the different phosphorylated kinase .",
    "these quantities assist in the evaluation of mutual information ( two variable and three variable ) under gaussian channel approximation .",
    "quantification of mutual information has been carried out with the variation of two cross - talk parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the two variable mutual information shows that cross - talk establishes an association of signal propagation among the two pathways .",
    "to represent a better insight into the directionality of the net information flow , we have defined a new dimensionless parameter ( net information transduction @xmath78 ) , which varies on a scale of @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath78 , we have deciphered the fidelity of one pathway compared to the other .",
    "we show that cross - talk generates correlated fluctuations at the population level .",
    "a minimum and a maximum degree of coordination are observed at low and high level of cross - talk , respectively .",
    "our analysis thus suggests that coordinated fluctuations are the causal effect of cross - talk in mapk signaling pathways .",
    "furthermore , we have evaluated the impact of correlated association in maintaining cell - to - cell population variability of kinases using scattered plots . at the high degree of cross - talk , scattered plots show high correlation coefficient compared to lower level of cross talk .",
    "these results together imply that cross - talk not only develops synchronization in a cell but also among the cellular population .",
    "depending on the number of inputs and outputs , we have identified two types of signaling motifs from the composite network . in addition , quantification of three variable mutual information allows us to calculate the net synergy associated with these two different motifs .",
    "the signal integration motif ( two inputs and one output ) reveals high fidelity , whereas the signal bifurcation motif ( one input and two outputs ) shows redundancy in information propagation .",
    "based on the aforesaid theoretical discussion , we suggest a satisfactory explanation about the synchronization in the outputs - a causal effect of cross - talk in parallel mapk signaling pathways .",
    "nevertheless , one question obviously arises - what is the importance of such synchronization in cellular physiology ?",
    "such functional correlation is possibly required for both the outputs to perform in a combined way to regulate several essential downstream genes .",
    "several experimental results on mapk cross - talk in _",
    "s. cerevisiae _ provide interesting evidence that corroborate with our theoretical analysis . phosphorylated fus3 and kss1 are both responsible for the activation of transcription factor ste12 that regulates different downstream genes @xcite . additionally , both activated fus3 and hog1 assist in arresting the cell cycle in g1 phase temporarily @xcite .",
    "cross - talk is also highly significant for the eukaryotic cells where the promoter of tata binding proteins is solely controlled by mapk signaling pathways @xcite , whereas these binding proteins are essential for the expression of most nuclear genes .",
    "also , they act as a potential vehicle for developing coordination among the multiple disparate classes of genes . thus , coordinated signaling of mapk pathways paves the way for tata binding proteins to establish association among large - scale nuclear genes .",
    "gene regulation in _",
    "s. cerevisiae _ is known to be controlled by more than one transcription factors that bind cooperatively at many promoter sites .",
    "this phenomenon suggests that coordinated fluctuations between the outputs of mapk signaling pathways are necessary to express the gene product in a controlled way .",
    "it is also noticed that coordinated fluctuations among gene products are developed through transcriptional as well as translational cross - talk @xcite .",
    "we propose that it could be more convenient for a cell to establish a functional connection among all intracellular processes if the correlation is initiated in the signaling pathway , not solely in the gene regulation stage .",
    "in fact , one interesting signature which has been observed in different experiments is that cross - talk is prominent at low concentration level that is manifested in diverse environmental cues @xcite .",
    "thus , in these situations , fluctuations in the cellular components are very high and it is very unlikely for cells to adopt a constructive decision for survival @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that such decision making program becomes easy when correlated fluctuations among the essential proteins are successfully implemented through the bet - hedging program @xcite .",
    "overall , we suggest that synchronization between mapk signaling pathways is a result of cross - talk . our analytical calculation supplemented by exact numerical simulation is a general approach and can be applied to other cross - talk pathways to quantify the strength of cross - interactions",
    ". our theoretical observations in the present work could be verified upon the quantification of phosphorylated kinase protein in a single cell using flow cytometry and time lapse microscopy @xcite . in future , we plan to address the influence and physiological relevance of cross - talk in other network motifs .",
