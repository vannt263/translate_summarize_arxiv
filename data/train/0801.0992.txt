    "electron and nuclear spin degrees of freedom are promising candidates for a variety of quantum information processing ( qip ) devices @xcite . while the wide range of existing microfabrication techniques make solid - state architectures extremely appealing in terms of large - scale integration , such an advantage is seriously hampered by the noisy environments which are typical of solid - state systems , and are responsible for unwanted rapid decoherence .",
    "for an electron spin localized in a gaas quantum dot ( qd ) @xcite , for instance , the relevant coherence time is extremely short : at typical experimental temperatures ( t @xmath1  mk ) and sub - tesla magnetic fields , the electron free induction decay ( fid ) time @xmath2  ns @xcite , the dominant decoherence mechanism being the hyperfine coupling to the surrounding bath of ga and as nuclear spins . although efforts for achieving faster gating times may contribute to alleviate the problem , it remains both highly desirable and presently more practical to extend the coherence time of the central system ( the electron spin ) in the presence of the spin bath .",
    "several proposals have been recently put forward to meet this challenge .",
    "a first strategy is to manipulate the spin bath .",
    "polarizing the nuclear spins , for instance , may significantly increase the coherence time @xcite , provided that nuclear - spin polarization @xmath3 may be achieved .",
    "this , however , remains well beyond the current experimental capabilities .",
    "another suggestive possibility , based on narrowing the distribution of nuclear spin states  @xcite , has been predicted to enhance electron coherence by up to a factor of hundred , upon repeatedly measuring and pumping the electron into an auxiliary excited trion state  which also appears very challenging at present .    as an alternative approach ,",
    "direct manipulation of the central spin by means of electron spin resonance ( esr ) @xcite and dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite techniques appears ideally suited to hyperfine - induced decoherence suppression , in view of the long correlation time and non - markovian behavior which distinguish the nuclear spin reservoir .",
    "a single - pulse hahn - echo protocol has been implemented recently in a double - qd device @xcite , increasing the coherence time by two orders of magnitude .",
    "significant potential of more elaborated pulse sequences , such as the multi - pulse carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) protocol @xcite and concatenated dd ( cdd ) @xcite , has been established theoretically for a single qd subjected to a _",
    "strong _ external bias field , whereby the electron effectively undergoes a purely dephasing process .",
    "the dd problem for the more complex situation of a _ zero or low _ bias fields , where pure dephasing and relaxation compete , has been recently examined in refs . .",
    "having established the existence of highly effective dd schemes for electron spin storage , the purpose of this work is twofold : first , to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing dd performance and the range of applicability of conclusions based on analytical average hamiltonian theory ( aht ) approaches ; and second , to assess the influence of various factors which may cause the system and/or control hamiltonians to differ from the idealized starting point chosen for analysis .    aside from its prospective practical significance ,",
    "developing and benchmarking strategies for decoherence suppression in various spin nanosystems is interesting from the broader perspective of quantum control theory .",
    "in particular , standard theoretical tools usually employed for the analysis of dd performance , such as aht and the magnus expansion ( me ) , have very restrictive formal requirements of applicability ( very fast control time scales , bounded environments , etc ) , which may be hard to meet in realistic systems .",
    "thus , in - depth studies of physically motivated examples are essential to understand how to go beyond the formal error bounds _ sufficient _ for convergence , and to identify more realistic _ necessary _ criteria for dd efficiency . in this sense , a qd system , described by the central spin model ( a central spin-@xmath4 interacting with a bath of @xmath5 external spins @xcite ) both provides a natural testbed for detailed dd analysis , and paves the way to understanding more complex many - spin central systems .    in this work",

    "special emphasis is devoted to the concatenated protocol ( pcdd@xmath6 ) , which was identified as the best performer for this system in ref .  .",

    "compared to other decoherence control strategies , dd has many attractive features : it is a purely open - loop control method which , as such , avoids the need of measurements and/or feedback ; it does not rely on a particular initial state which might be hard to prepare ; its design and implementation may significantly benefit from the extensive expertise available from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and esr techniques",
