    "in 1964 , using state - of - the - art torsion experiments , tinder and co - workers were able to achieve a strain resolution of @xmath0 for sub mm - sized samples to study the micro - plastic regime of highly pure poly - crystal cu samples @xcite , followed by tests on zn single crystals some years later @xcite .",
    "their plastic - strain versus stress curves contained plateaus of stress which were attributed to the occurrence of discrete dislocation glide activity over a length scale comparable to the dislocation spacing of an assumed three - dimensional network .",
    "indeed the authors write in ref .",
    "@xcite , `` the results suggest that an important fraction of the total strain , in the initial stages of deformation , involved motion of a few favourably situated dislocation segments through distances large enough to form new interactions with other elements of the three dimensional network . if this were so , then most elements of the network must have been relatively immobile , making little or no contribution to the strain . ''",
    "that most dislocations remain immobile remains a contemporary viewpoint  @xcite .",
    "another more recently pursued route is to probe discrete dislocation activity via the stress - strain curve of micron sized focused ion beam ( fib ) milled single crystals . here",
    ", advantage is taken of a nano - indentation platform equipped with a flat punch tip to compress micro-/nano - crystals  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sub - nanometer displacement resolution of the system , which notably has a lower strain resolution than the above mentioned torsion experiments , the sample size is decreased to the micron range and below . as a result",
    ", the strain associated with the discrete dislocation activity is increased to an easily detectable magnitude . whilst this more contemporary work has been primarily motivated by the `` smaller - is - stronger '' size - effect paradigm @xcite ,",
    "an extensive analysis of the statistics of the discrete dislocation activity has revealed power - law behavior in the distribution of strain - burst magnitudes giving an exponent of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "similar exponents can also be found in bulk samples via detailed analysis of load displacement signals , where structural evolution is also seen to occur  @xcite .",
    "the very recent work of dahmen and co - workers  @xcite suggest that the variation in literature exponent values could be due to the different stress intervals used to bin the strain burst magnitude data , where a total integration over the stress interval to material value should , within mean field theory , give an exponent equal to precisely two .",
    "such exponents are indicative of crackling  @xcite or barkhausen noise , and more generally of avalanche phenomena , indicating that dislocation mediated plastic deformation belongs to a universality class that encompasses many natural phenomenon over a variety of different length and timescales .",
    "indeed , similar power - law exponents can also be found for metallic glasses  @xcite in which the underlying plastic deformation is fundamentally different to crystalline metals .",
    "another class of experiments revealing the intermittent nature of dislocation dynamics is the acoustic emission monitoring of ice  @xcite",
    ". such experiments measure the acoustic energy released by intermittent dislocation activity during constant stress deformation ( in the tertiary creep regime ) .",
    "indeed , via single sensor acoustic emission signals , such dislocation activity can be well characterised in time revealing power - law behaviour with exponents of 1.6 to 1.8 , which is very similar to that seen via the micro - compression stress - strain curves  @xcite . furthermore , via multiple sensor monitoring , time and space clustering of dislocation avalanches could be observed  @xcite .",
    "it was found that avalanche epi - centres were correlated in space according to a non - integer power - law exponent indicating scale - free clustering and at short enough times such clusters were correlated in time indicating collective activity .    that such scale - invariant dislocation activity occurs , is a signature of an underlying complex dislocation based micro - structure .",
    "an entity whose properties and evolution under an applied stress play a central role in the more general subjects of material strength and strain hardening  @xcite . due to the complex dynamics and evolution of the dislocation structure ,",
    "computer simulation based approaches have helped greatly over the past decades to clarify the underlying dislocation based mechanisms responsible for such structural evolution .",
    "one such method is the so - called dislocation dynamics ( dd ) approach .",
    "early work involved two dimensional arrays of straight edge dislocations interacting via elasticity using single- and multi - slip geometries  @xcite .",
    "these works demonstrate that under an external stress , dislocation patterning emerges analogous to what is seen in static transmission electron microscopy experiments .",
    "other and more recent works have developed these numerical techniques in terms of efficiency  @xcite , strain boundary - conditions and obstacle / composite geometries @xcite to study more complex patterning such as the emergence of granular cell structures and the study of grain boundary network evolution @xcite , strain hardening , and material strength in both bulk and confined volume systems @xcite .",
    "analogous methodologies and investigations have also been carried out in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "intermittent dislocation activity , in the form of dislocation avalanches , has also been studied using the dd simulation technique  @xcite .",
    "such simulations have produced power - law exponents of the distribution of strain burst magnitudes similar to that seen in experiments , indicating some degree of scale - free behaviour , where dislocations are arranged in meta - stable cell and/or wall structures , with only a minor fraction of the dislocation population moving intermittently , thereby creating discrete strain jumps .",
    "the so - called self organised criticality ( soc ) view of the dislocation network state offers one theoretical platform for the understanding of the observed universality  @xcite , in which the material system organises itself into a configuration that is critical , resulting in scale - free behaviour upon transiting to a new realisation of the critical state .",
    "originally developed to describe sand - pile dynamics  @xcite , the approach is somewhat at odds with the historical viewpoint that dislocation structure evolution is primarily driven by equilibrium driving forces such as that embodied in low energy structures ( les ) theory  @xcite and in a wide range of strain hardening theories .",
    "the finding that the occurrence of avalanche phenomenon is insensitive to the nature of the forming immobile dislocation network , the slip geometry , the deformation mode , and the details of the dislocation dynamics and spatial dimension is a central hallmark of soc , which is robust against the details of the underlying physical model .",
    "this motivates investigating plastic flow with simpler models that explicitly do not take into account the fine details of individually interacting sessile and mobile dislocations , naturally shifting the focus of plastic flow from complex dislocation structural evolution to the interaction of a minute mobile dislocation population with a simplified description of the sessile dislocation population .",
    "such an approach is analogous to the study of dislocations in the presence of pinning potentials @xcite and more generally to coarse grained models of plasticity that study the depinning transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and also refs .",
    "dislocation field theories are also well able to study intermittency , however unlike dislocation dynamics based methods which are able to simulate only small plastic strains , these models are able to incorporate dislocation transport over non - neglible distances and therefore able to simulate significant structural evolution  @xcite .    in this work , a simple model is therefore proposed in which a dipolar dislocation mat  @xcite is embedded into an internal static sinusoidal stress field defined by a wave - length and a shear - stress amplitude .",
    "the explicit dislocation population is modelled via a standard dd algorithm .",
    "it is found that , similar to very complex and detailed 3d - dd simulations , the resulting stress - strain curves evolve in a discrete manner that reflects an underlying intermittent plasticity originating from irreversible changes in dislocation configuration , and that the distribution of the corresponding strain - burst magnitudes reveal both extremal value statistics and scale - free avalanche behaviour .",
    "thus , although the complex details of microscopic dislocation mechanisms and structure are omitted , the simple model is still able to capture the fundamental properties of intermittent micro - plastic flow .    in the following section ,",
    "the model is formally introduced and the dd technique described , and in sec .  [ sec_loading ] various loading modes to produce a stress - strain curve are presented .",
    "[ sec_results ] presents the dd simulations for a wide range of model parameters to investigate their effect on deformation behaviour .",

    "[ sec_discussion ] discusses the context for the model , where it is argued that its applicable range is restricted to the micro - plastic region of the stress - strain curve  a regime where significant structural evolution and work hardening are , to a large extent , absent  @xcite .",
    "the proposed model consists of two parallel slip planes , in the @xmath2 plane , separated by a distance @xmath3 along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "each slip plane is populated by infinitely long straight edge dislocations where one slip plane contains @xmath5 dislocations with burgers vector @xmath6 and the other @xmath7 dislocations with burgers vector @xmath8 .",
    "equal numbers of each type of dislocation are considered to ensure no net burgers vector content : @xmath9 .",
    "such a structure is traditionally known as a simple dipolar mat  @xcite . to this , a time independent internal sinusoidal shear - stress field is added of the form @xmath10 which is parametrised by a shear - stress amplitude @xmath11 and a periodic length scale @xmath12 . fig .",
    "[ schematic_fig ] displays a schematic of the model system in which the line direction of each straight dislocation is perpendicular to the plane of the figure .",

    "[ sec_discussion ] , however , its existence should be viewed as a simplified representation of a pre - existing ( and unchanging ) immobile dislocation population . the explicit dislocations , schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic_fig ] , are therefore to be viewed as the mobile dislocation population of the system , and are quantified by their density @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to the force arising from the internal shear - stress field , each dislocation will experience a force of elastic origin from all other dislocations within the system .",
    "since it is assumed that the dislocations are unable to leave their slip plane , the only relevant force per unit dislocation length component will be along the @xmath13 direction and , via isotropic elasticity , may be calculated from the well known expression between two edge dislocations ( labelled @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) on parallel slip planes  @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the isotropic shear modulus and @xmath21 possion s ratio of the isotropic elastic medium , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the burgers vector in the x - direction of the @xmath17th ( @xmath18th ) dislocation , and @xmath24 is the two dimensional vector defining the dislocations spatial separation .",

    "the temporal evolution of a particular dislocation configuration is characterised by the choice of an empirical mobility law . due to the actual discreteness of the lattice at the atomic scale",
    ", a dislocation segment must overcome an energy barrier associated with the local shearing of atoms in order to move an atomic distance .",
    "this so - called peierls energy barrier and the associated peierls stress  @xcite , the stress at which the dislocation can begin to move ( defined at a given temperature ) , results in the dislocation moving quasi - statically from atomic lattice site to atomic lattice site . at the meso - scopic scale",
    "this results in over - damped motion where the dislocation s velocity is proportional to the force acting on the dislocation  the present mobility law .",
    "the material specific proportionality constant is referred to as a damping parameter and is dependent on dislocation type , geometry , and on temperature .",

    "although patterning is a term predominantly referring to the effects of latter stage ii and iii hardening regimes , the emergence of micro - structure length scales is expected to occur at all stages of plasticity ranging from slip , dipole and eventually cellular patterns  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a micro - structural length - scale can equally well be defined for an undeformed as - grown material , where the mean dislocation spacing can be used to describe the initially present internal stress fluctuations  a view point that is central to the early work of tinder and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "from this perspective the imposed sinusoidal stress field , can be viewed as the simplest realisation of the internal stress field arising from such a structure .    in the present model",
    "this stress field is time independent , implying it is constructed by that part of the dislocation population that is immobile , with the explicit dislocations and their dynamics , arising from the ( much smaller ) mobile component of the dislocation population .",
    "thus a typical loading simulation can be seen as the deformation of a model material that has a particular sample preparation or deformation history characterised by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and a mobile dislocation density that is only a small part of the total dislocation density .",
    "much past work exists concerning the emergence of internal stress and length scales as a function of deformation history . in early work on the theory of cell formation",
    ", two relationships have emerged in which the total evolving dislocation density , @xmath109 , plays a central role .",
    "they are : @xmath110 and @xmath111 where @xmath20 is a representative ( not necessarily pure ) shear modulus and @xmath112 the burgers vector magnitude . in the above , @xmath113 is the evolving flow stress of the material and @xmath114 is an evolving internal length scale that can be referred to as a cell size .",
    "the first expression has its earliest origins in a taylor hardening picture in which the total dislocation density is seen as an immobile forest dislocation population .",
    "the second equation has its theoretical origins in the early work of holt  @xcite who derived it for a dipolar population of screw - dislocations , showing that a uniform arrangement was unstable to fluctuations with one such length scale dominating , characterised by eqn .",
    "[ eqcell2 ] .",
    "this length scale , which could be related to a fixed self - screening distance of the dislocation network , was postulated to reflect an emerging cell size .",
    "the approach was based on an energy minimisation principle , however due to dislocation reactions , the more modern viewpoint is that the dynamics of cell formation lies in a statistical process involving dislocation reactions and that the screening length , and therefore cell - size , is an evolving variable  @xcite .",
    "thus , the model parameter @xmath12 has a direct counterpart in cell formation theory , @xmath114 , which can represent quite generally , a mean - free path for a mobile dislocation , a dipolar screening length or a well evolved cell length scale .",
    "moreover , since an unloading / loading cycle will generally return a system to the flow stress before unloading , and that the present simulations have shown that the flow stress is partly controlled by @xmath11 , @xmath11 should be in some way related to @xmath113 .",
    "from this perspective , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are parameters that are not entirely independent from each other .",

    "[ eqcell1 ] and [ eqcell2 ] express that the cell size decreases inversely as a function of flow stress , a well known experimental observation that is refered to as `` similitude ''  @xcite .",

    "early tensile / tem work on tapered cu single crystals finds an initially broad distribution of cell sizes that narrows and shifts to small lengths with increasing flow stress  @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that a single structural length - scale might not always be a good statistical description of the evolving micro - structure .",
    "indeed , more modern viewpoints , in which dislocation structure evolution is a non - equilibrium process  @xcite , tend to suggest a distribution of emerging length - scales leading to a scale - free fractal - like structure .",
    "although such micro - structures have been quantitatively established by tem investigations of latter - stage hardened single crystals of cu  @xcite , their existence is not universal , depending strongly on material type and deformation history .",
    "the current work does not address this aspect .",
    "more general forms of an inhomogeneous internal stress field that capture such scale - free micro - structural features can be envisioned ; a direction which will be investigated in future work .    whilst the dipolar mat geometry in an external field offers a platform with which to study the depinning transition and more generally the transition to extended plastic flow , when comparing to experiment , careful consideration has to be given to its regime of applicability . to do this , a typical simulation of secs .",
    "[ sec_results ] and [ sec_statistics ] is now broadly summarised . upon choosing numerical values for all model parameters ,",
    "the @xmath82 dislocations are introduced to the system via a distribution of random positions .",

    "the deformation simulation is then begun using one of the three loading modes of sec .",
    "[ sec_loading ] .",
    "as the stress increases , intermittent plasticity increasingly occurs until a stress is reached at which extended and overlapping strain events occur , which in the previous sections has loosely been referred to as the plastic flow regime .",
    "it is important to emphasise that no attempt has been made to obtain the global energy minimum of the starting configuration .",
    "such an initial state turns out to play a crucial role in the observed properties of the model , since many high energy configurations will exist , and it is these that dominate the early stages of plasticity . as a deformation simulation proceeds , such high energy configurations",
    "structurally transform eventually leading to a plastic flow regime and often to the homogenisation of the dislocation configuration .",
    "in other words , the extended plastic flow regime should be considered to be outside the applicability regime of the present model when a comparison to experiment is made , or equivalently , the present model is only suitable for the study of the micro plastic regime of the stress - strain curve .    the rational behind the use of an initial high - energy dislocation configuration originates from the assumption that the explicit dislocation population of the model represents only the mobile dislocation network , which constitutes only a small part of the true population .",
    "thus , in the same way as @xmath11 and @xmath12 characterise the sample preparation or deformation history of the model material , so does the initial high energy ( explicit ) mobile dislocation content .",
    "this is quite compatible from the perspective of soc in which the dislocation structure reaches a critical configuration that is far from equilibrium , and that structural rearrangements correspond to the system transforming from one soc state to another . by construction ,",
    "that part mediating the structural transformation will be the current mobile dislocation content .",
    "the central simplification of the present model , is that it separates the mobile and immobile populations , associating the former to an explicit mobile dislocation content that represents the non - equilibrium component of the network , and relegating the latter to an effective static internal stress field .",
    "that this internal stress field is unchanging and that the same explicit mobile dislocation population exists as a function of strain for the entire deformation simulation , is of course different from a real material , where the structure evolves with strain , and at any particular non - negligible strain interval , quite different dislocations might constitute the mobile dislocation population .",
    "this again emphasises that the present model should only be applied to the micro plastic regime , where significant structural evolution is minimal .",
    "experimental evidence for a lack of structural evolution in the mico - plastic regime is best seen in low amplitude cyclic deformation experiments of fcc metals , in which the plastic strain per cycle can be as low as @xmath115 leading to significant changes in load stress and internal length scale only after the occurrence of several tens - to - hundreds of thousands of cycles  @xcite .",
    "it is further noted , that documented experimental studies on the micro - plasticity at room temperature primarily report on movements of edge or non - screw type dislocations , whereas a clear increase in dislocation density or the formation of dislocation structures as a result of multiplication remains absent  @xcite . in the bulk case",
    "there are exceptions to this trend where in the case of a work - hardened al - mg alloy which exhibits dynamic strain ageing , emerging structural length - scales were already detected in the micro - plastic regime  @xcite using high - resolution extensometry methods  @xcite .    the results of sec .",

    "is connected to the dependence of the intermittent plasticity on the extremal configurations of the explicit dislocation population .",
    "this was directly seen in the statistics of the first - burst shear - stress and also the distribution of strain burst magnitudes , where with a large enough increase of @xmath12 ( say from 2 @xmath59 m to 10 @xmath59 m ) the first burst statistics changes from being dominated by extreme value statistics to that being dominated by the statistics of the most probable ( fig .",

    "<S> here we present a model to study the micro - plastic regime of a stress - strain curve . in this model </S>",
    "<S> an explicit dislocation population represents the mobile dislocation content and an internal shear - stress field represents a mean - field description of the immobile dislocation content . </S>",
    "<S> the mobile dislocations are constrained to a simple dipolar mat geometry and modelled via a dislocation dynamics algorithm , whilst the shear - stress field is chosen to be a sinusoidal function of distance along the mat direction . </S>",
    "<S> the sinusoidal function , defined by a periodic length and a shear - stress amplitude , is interpreted to represent a pre - existing micro - structure . </S>",
    "<S> these model parameters , along with the mobile dislocation density , are found to admit a diversity of micro - plastic behaviour involving intermittent plasticity in the form of a scale - free avalanche phenomenon , with an exponent and scaling - collapse for the strain burst magnitude distribution that is in agreement with mean - field theory and similar to that seen in experiment and more complex dislocation dynamics simulations . </S>"
