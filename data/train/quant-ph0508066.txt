    "wavelet is a ` small wave ' which is localized in both time and frequency space@xcite .",
    "it is this unique characteristic that makes wavelets analysis in some ways superior to fourier analysis which employs ` big waves ' ( sinusoid or cosine ) , e.g. , wavelets are particularly useful when processing data with sharp discontinuities or compressing image data .",
    "mathematically , a wavelet @xmath0 of the real variable @xmath1 must satisfy the following admissibility condition @xmath2which suggests that @xmath3 behaves like a wave , and in contrast to sinusoid , it decreases rapidly to zero as @xmath4 tends to infinity .",
    "the theory of wavelets is concerned with the representation of a function in terms of a two - parameter family of dilates and translates of a fixed function , which is usually known as the `` mother wavelet '' .",
    "a family of wavelets @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is a scaling parameter , @xmath7 is a translation parameter , @xmath8 are constructed from the mother wavelet @xmath0 , and the dilated - translated functions are defined as @xmath9and the wavelet integral transform of a signal function @xmath10 by @xmath5 is defined by @xmath11the admissibility condition ( 1 ) ensures that the inverse transform and parseval formula are applicable .",
    "when @xmath3 is an odd function of @xmath1 , it satisfies ( 1 ) obviously .",
    "a typical @xmath12 , which is an even function of @xmath1 , is the mexican hat wavelet ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath13satisfying @xmath14    an important question thus naturally arises : how to find more even functions which also satisfy ( 1 ) , i.e. are there a series of even functions which can be considered as generalized mexican hat wavelets ? to our knowledge , this question has not been posed and solved in the literature before . in this letter",
    "we shall derive a general formula for finding mexican hat wavelets by taking the advantage of dirac s representation theory and the coherent state theory in quantum optics , so that more mother wavelets and correspondingly more wavelet - transformations can be introduced .",
    "dirac s representation theory is not just a foundation of quantum mechanics theory@xcite ; it has its own special features which allow it to be extended to new theoretical problems . in this letter",
    "we shall show how this theory can help us to directly derive general formula for finding mexican hat wavelets .    according to dirac s representation theory",

    "now we analyze the condition ( 1 ) for mother wavelet in the context of quantum optics theory . due to dirac s representation transformation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the momentum eigenstate,@xmath39we have @xmath40which can help us to recast the condition ( 1 ) into dirac s ket - bra formalism",
