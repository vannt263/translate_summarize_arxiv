    "up to now , numerous studies analyzing financial time series have been carried out to understand the complex economic systems made up of diverse and complicated agents @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis of economic or financial time series exhibits features different from the random - walk model based on the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) , which are called stylized facts [ 2 - 15 ] .",
    "previous studies showed that the returns of both stocks and foreign exchange rate have a variety of stylized facts .",
    "for example , the distribution of financial time series follows a universal power - law distribution with an exponent @xmath1 [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "while the temporal correlation of returns follows the process of random walks , the volatility of returns shows a long - term - memory property [ 12 - 15 ] .",
    "however , recent work has revealed that the distribution function of returns in emerging markets follows an exponential distribution , while the mature markets follow a power - law distribution with an exponent @xmath4 @xcite .    in this paper , we use detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , which was introduced by peng _",
    "_ to find the long - term - memory property of time series data @xcite and utilizes the surrogate test method proposed by theiler _",
    "_ to measure the non - linearity of time series @xcite .",
    "we study daily international market indices of seven countries from 1991 to 2005 , the high - frequency @xmath5 500 5-minute index from 1995 to 2004 , and the high - frequency kosdaq 1-minute index from 1997 to 2004 , to investigate diverse time characteristics of financial market indices .",
    "we found that the returns of international stock market indices of seven countries follow a universal power - law distribution with an exponent of @xmath1 , while the korean stock market follows an exponential distribution with an exponent of @xmath6 . for a more detailed statistical analysis ,",
    "the original return time series is divided into magnitude and sign time series , and the corresponding hurst exponents are computed .",
    "the hurst exponent analysis of the original return , and its magnitude and sign time series , reveal that the long - term - memory property , which is absent in the return and sign time series , exists in the magnitude time series with @xmath3 .    in order to test the nonlinearity of the time series",
    ", the surrogate test is performed for all time series .",
    "we find that the magnitude time series reflects the non - linearity of the return series , which helps to reveal that the kosdaq index , one of the emerging markets , shows higher volatility than a mature market such as the s&p 500 index .    in the next section ,",
    "we explain the market data used in our investigations . in section [ sec : methods ] .",
    ", we introduce the methods of the surrogate test and detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) . in section [ sec : results ] .",
    ", the results of the statistical analysis for various time series of the market data are presented .",
    "finally , we end with a summary of our findings .",
    "we use the return series in eight daily international market indices of seven countries from 1991 to 2005 , the @xmath5 500 index ( 5 minutes ) from 1995 to 2004 , and the kosdaq index ( 1 minute ) from 1997 to 2004 .",
    "the seven countries are france ( cac40 ) , germany ( dax ) , united kingdom ( ftse100 ) , hong kong ( hangseng ) , korea ( kospi ) , america ( nasdaq ) , japan ( nikkei225 ) , and america ( s&p 500 ) .",
    "we make use of the normalized return often used in the financial time series analysis instead of the stock prices .",
    "let @xmath7 , be the daily stock prices .",
    "the normalized return @xmath8 at a given time t is defined by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the standard deviation of the return .",
    "the normalized returns @xmath11 are divided into magnitude and sign series by using the following relation :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the return series of the k - th market index calculated by the log - difference , @xmath14 the magnitude series of the returns of the k - th market index , and @xmath15 the sign series with @xmath16 for the upturn and @xmath17 for the downturn . note that the magnitude series @xmath18 from taking the absolute value of the return measures the size of the return change , and the sign series @xmath19 measures the direction of the change .",
    "the volatility of the returns can be studied though the magnitude series @xmath18 .",
    "the surrogate test method was first proposed by theiler _",
    "_ to prove the non - linearity contained in the time series @xcite .",
    "the surrogate data test can be explained by the following four steps @xcite .",
    "first , a null hypothesis is made and the features of the linear process following the hypothesis are defined . in general , the linearity uses the mean , the variance , and the autocorrelation of the original time series .",
    "the surrogate data are randomly generated but retain the autocorrelation function , the mean , and the variance of the original data . in the second step , the surrogate data are created through the fast fourier transform(fft ) method .",
    "let @xmath20 be the original time series .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath21 of @xmath20 is given by    @xmath22    then , @xmath21 is multiplied by random phases ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is uniformly distributed in [ 0 , 2@xmath25 .",
    "the inverse fft of @xmath26 gives the surrogate data retaining the linearity in the original time series ,    @xmath27    in the third step , non - linear measurements with the entropy , the dimension , and lyapunov exponents are performed for the original data and the surrogate data , respectively .",
    "finally , the difference in measurements of the original data and the surrogate data is tested for significance .",
    "if significant , the hypothesis will be rejected and the original data are regarded as having non - linearity .      the typical methods to analyze the long - term - memory property in the time series data are largely classified into three types : the re - scaled range analysis ( r / s ) method proposed by mandelbrot and wallis @xcite , the modified r / s analysis by lo _",
    "@xcite , and the dfa ( detrended fluctuation analysis ) method by peng _",
    "_ @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the dfa method is used due to its effectiveness even for the absence of long - term memory .",
    "the hurst exponent can be calculated by the dfa method through the following process .",
    "step ( 1 ) : the time series after the subtraction of the mean are accumulated as follows :    @xmath28,\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 are the i - th time series , and @xmath30 is the mean of the whole time series .",
    "this accumulation process is one that changes the original data into a self - similar process .    step ( 2 ) :",
    "the accumulated time series are divided into boxes of the same length @xmath31 . in each box of length @xmath31",
    ", the trend is estimated through the ordinary least square method , called dfa(m ) , where m is the order of fitting . in each box",
    ", the ordinary least square line is expressed as @xmath32 . by subtracting @xmath32 from the accumulated @xmath33 in each box ,",
    "the trend is removed .",
    "this process is applied to every box and the fluctuation magnitude is calculated by using    @xmath34 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    the process of step ( 2 ) is repeated for every scale , from which we obtain a scaling relation @xmath35 where h is the hurst exponent .",
    "the hurst exponent characterizes the correlation of time series with three different properties . if @xmath36 , the time series is anti - persistent . if @xmath37 , it is persistent . in the case of h = 0.5 ,",

    "figure 1(b ) is a linear - log plot of the distribution function of the kospi index .    in figure 1(a ) , we find that the tail exponents of the indices of all the countries except korea follow a universal power - law distribution with an exponent @xmath1 .",
    "however , in figure 1(b ) , we find that the korean stock market follows an exponential distribution with @xmath2 , not a power - law distribution .",
    "these results indicate that the distribution of returns in the kospi index , that belongs to the emerging markets , does not follow a power - law distribution with the exponent @xmath1 .",

    ", the sign series corresponds to random walks ( @xmath38 ) , but the magnitude series has a long - term - memory property ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows that all hurst exponents of the corresponding surrogate data follow random walks .    in order to find the time evolution of the hurst exponent",
    ", we also investigated the time series by shifting the @xmath5 500 5-minute index and kosdaq 1-minute index by 500 minutes and 100 minutes , respectively .",

    "the average hurst exponent @xmath38 for the @xmath5 500 index sign series of the returns , and @xmath40 for the magnitude time series .",
    "in addition , the surrogate test shows that the non - linearity of the original time series is reflected by the magnitude time series .    figure 5 shows the hurst exponent calculated with 6,000 data points by shifting approximately 100 minutes for the kosdaq 1-minute index from 1997 to 2004 .",
    "though on average @xmath38 , the hurst exponent of the returns changes considerably over time , unlike the @xmath5 500 index with a more or less uniform hurst exponent .",
    "in particular , in the kosdaq index during its bubble period from the second half of 1999 to mid-2000 , a large long - term - memory property is observed in the return series .",
    "after the market bubble burst , we found that the hurst exponent of the returns dropped to 0.5 .",
    "this result indicates that the kosdaq index may have improved its market efficiency after the bubble .",
    "as in the previous results , the non - linearity of the original time series of the kosdaq data is reflected in the magnitude time series , and the linearity in the sign time series .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the statistical features of international stock market indices of seven countries , high - frequency @xmath5 500 and kosdaq data . for this purpose",
    ", the tail index was studied through a linear fitting method by using the hurst exponent by the dfa method .",
    "also , the non - linearity was measured through the surrogate test method .",
    "we find that the absolute value distribution of the returns of international stock market indices follows a universal power - law distribution , having a tail index @xmath1 .",
    "however , the korean stock market follows an exponential distribution with @xmath2 , not a power - law distribution .",
    "we also found that in the time series of international market indices , the @xmath5 500 index and the kosdaq index , the returns and sign series follow random walks ( @xmath38 ) , but the magnitude series does not . on the other hand",
    ", we found that in all the time series , the hurst exponent of the magnitude time series has a long - term - memory property ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "furthermore , we found that in high - frequency data , the kosdaq index , one of the emerging markets , shows higher volatility than a mature market such as the s&p 500 index , which is possibly caused by the abnormally generated bubble .",
    "we found a long - term - memory property in the magnitude time series of all data , regardless of nation or time scale .",
    "non - linear features of the returns are generally observed in the magnitude time series .",
