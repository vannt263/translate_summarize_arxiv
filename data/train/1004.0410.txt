    "developing a microscopic , analytic theory of glassy polymeric mechanical response has been a longstanding challenge .",
    "plasticity in amorphous materials is almost always _ viscoplasticity _ , i.  e.  plasticity with rate dependence .",
    "many recent studies have focused on plasticity in metallic or colloidal glasses .",
    "relative to these systems , polymer glasses possess a wider range of characteristic length and time scales , because of the connectivity , uncrossability , and random - walk - like structure of the constituent chains .",
    "these alter the mechanical properties significantly @xcite ; for example , a uniquely polymeric feature of plastic response is massive strain hardening beyond yield .",
    "the relationships between polymeric relaxation times on different spatial scales are fairly well understood for melts @xcite , but much less so for glasses .",
    "recent experiments @xcite , simulations @xcite , and theories @xcite have all shown that local ( segment - level ) relaxation times in polymer glasses decrease dramatically under active deformation ( especially at yield ) and increase when deformation is ceased .",
    "analysis of this phenomena has focused on stress - assisted thermal activation of the local relaxation processes , but it is likely that other structural relaxation processes at larger scales or of different ( e.  g.  strain activated ) character are also important in determining the mechanical response .",
    "improved understanding of the concomitant scale - dependent relaxation is necessary to better understand polymeric plasticity and material failure .",
    "however , theoretical prediction of large - scale relaxation in deformed polymer glasses is still in its infancy ; most treatments evaluate mechanical response `` neglecting the effect of the ongoing structural relaxation during the experiment '' @xcite .",
    "this paper is an attempt to improve on this state of affairs .",
    "we develop a theory that treats large - scale relaxation of uncrosslinked chains during active deformation .",
    "stress in the postyield regime is assumed to arise from the local plastic rearrangements similar to those which control plastic flow ; as strain increases , these increase in rate with the volume over which they are correlated .",
    "polymeric strain hardening is thus cast as plastic flow in a medium where the effective flow stress increases with large scale chain orientation .",
    "relaxation of chain orientation is treated here as inherently strain activated and _ coherent _ , i.  e.  cooperative along the chain backbone .",
    "our theory predicts a continuous crossover from perfect plasticity to `` gaussian '' ( neohookean ) @xcite strain hardening as the degree of polymerization @xmath0 increases .",
    "the latter form is predicted when chains deform affinely on large scales , and corresponds to the limit where the system is deformed faster than chains can relax .",
    "a key difference from most previous theories is that instead of invoking entanglements , we relate the timescale @xmath3 for large scale chain relaxation to the segmental relaxation time @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with : ( i ) the picture that stress arises predominantly from local plasticity @xcite , ( ii ) recent dielectric spectroscopy experiments indicating connections between relaxations on small and large scales @xcite , and ( iii ) recent nmr experiments @xcite that have found the effective `` constraint '' density for deformed glasses is much larger than the entanglement density measured in the melt . by relating strain hardening to interactions on the scale of monomers and segments , we make a novel prediction of its magnitude .",
    "we test our predictions using coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulations of polymer glasses , and in all cases find ( at least ) semiquantitative agreement .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we motivate and develop the theory for mechanical response , make predictions that illustrate the effect of coherent relaxation in constant - strain - rate deformation and constant - strain relaxation experiments , and test these using simulations . finally , in section [ sec : discuss ] , we summarize our results , place our work in the context of recent theories and experiments , discuss how the model could be more quantitatively tested experimentally , and conclude .",

    "one is that chains in uncrosslinked glasses will not in general deform affinely at large scales comparable to the radius of gyration .",

    "<S> it captures the crossover from perfect - plastic response to gaussian strain hardening as the degree of polymerization @xmath0 increases , without invoking entanglements . by relating hardening to interactions on the scale of monomers and chain segments </S>",
    "<S> , we correctly predict its magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> strain activated relaxation arising from the need to maintain constant chain contour length reduces the characteristic relaxation time by a factor @xmath1 during active deformation at strain rate @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is consistent with results from recent experiments and simulations , and we suggest how it may be further tested experimentally . </S>"
