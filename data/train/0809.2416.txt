    "although the vast majority of stars actually form in gas - embedded star clusters , galaxies are predominantly made of field stars . in this respect , a peak in a star cluster age distribution only tells us _ when _ an epoch of enhanced star cluster formation took place , not yet _ how much total stellar mass was involved_. to derive the total mass in stars formed in a starburst older than @xmath3 gyr from the integrated spectrum of a galaxy is , in the present state - of - the - art , hopeless  @xcite .",
    "knowing the mass fraction of all star formation still in bound clusters as a function of star cluster age , by properly accounting for cluster destruction and mass loss , would allow us to carry the analysis of galaxiesevolution one step further and to estimate the history of their overall star formation rate .",
    "we now have a fairly mature view of how to decipher the rates of _ bound _ cluster formation and evolution of a given star cluster system , in essence based on the cluster age and mass distributions  @xcite .",
    "that is , we are able to assess the amount of field stars arising from the secular evolution ( i.e. the preferential depletion of low - mass stars due to tidal stripping and internal two - body relaxation ) of star clusters which survived the expulsion of their residual star forming gas . as pointed out by @xcite , however , secular evolution does not necessarily affect the total mass in star clusters significantly . as for the star clusters of the galactic old halo and of the large magellanic cloud for instance ,",

    "similar flux ratios are inferred for the tadpole system , an example of a galaxy encounter between two unequal - mass galaxies .",
    "these high luminosity fractions , presumably representative of large mass fractions , demonstrate that star clusters contribute significantly to the total stellar light given off by young starbursts . while being higher than the initial galactic halo globular cluster mass fraction as compared to halo field stars , i.e. @xmath6 , these ratios are also conspicuously smaller than unity , thus confirming that the dissolution of star clusters takes place on a short time - scale .",
    "analyses of star cluster systems on the basis of multi - band imaging are feasible out to virgo cluster distances and have the potential to provide a comprehensive view of the individual star formation , chemical enrichment and mass assembly histories of their parent galaxies over the past hubble - time , provided that the last missing issue , establishing the ratio of star formation ending up in bound star clusters , is solved .",
    "this is what we attempt here , that is , we investigate what is / are the driving parameter(s ) behind the mass fraction of clusters as compared to field stars .",
    "specifically , we build on the @xmath0-body simulation grids recently obtained by @xcite to compute the evolution over the age range 1 - 100myr of the mass in clusters and to compare it with the overall star formation rate arising from the same star formation episode .",
    "we make predictions about the cluster formation efficiency ( i.e. the ratio between the total mass in clusters over the age range of relevance and the total mass in star forming gas cores ) and the ratio between the total mass in clusters and the total mass in stars .",

    "we note that the core number has been chosen so as to limit poissonian noise in the gas - embedded cluster formation rate we will derive , rather than as a match to a particular galaxy .",
    "we account for star formation with a time - independent gaussian probability distribution function of the sfe of mean @xmath16 and standard deviation @xmath17 , which we denote @xmath18 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath19 is the _ local _ sfe , that is , the core mass fraction turned into stars , as opposed to global sfe measured on galactic - wide or gmc - wide scales .",
    "the corresponding constant star formation rate is thus @xmath20 , equivalent here to the total stellar mass formed per unit of time in gas - embedded clusters .    to obtain the stellar mass @xmath21 still bound to a cluster of age @xmath11 through the infant mortality / infant weight - loss phase ,",
    "the gas - embedded cluster mass @xmath22 is multiplied by the bound fraction @xmath23 of stars at age @xmath11 : @xmath24 stellar groups of which the stellar mass is less than @xmath25 are not considered as star clusters and their mass is not accounted for in the total cluster mass . because of their small total mass , this is of negligible impact on the cluster - to - star mass ratios we derive . in the @xmath0-body grid of @xcite , from which our star cluster system simulations are derived , @xmath26 is defined as the stellar mass fraction of the initially gas - embedded cluster which resides within the instantaneous cluster tidal radius .",

    "however , this is at variance with observations that the radii of gas - embedded clusters and recently exposed clusters do not vary significantly ( @xmath30pc ) over several orders of magnitude of cluster masses  ( see table 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "considering how debated this issue remains , in what follows , we consider three distinct cases : cores with constant radius ( @xmath31 ) , constant density ( @xmath32 ) and constant surface density ( @xmath29 , i.e. virialized cores ) .",

    "the corresponding temporal evolution of the mass in star clusters is then straightforwardly built .",
    "we have simulated 18 different star cluster systems , combining the three core mass - radius relations described above with two mean sfes ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and three standard deviations ( @xmath43 ) for the sfe distribution function @xmath44 .",

    "the cluster formation efficiency @xmath76 is defined as the ratio between the total mass in stars bound to the clusters over the age range 1 - 100myr and the total mass in core gas .",

    "this tight relation is a direct consequence of residual star forming gas expulsion out of protoclusters . for a population of clusters which have survived their violent relaxation and which are not yet affected by secular evolution significantly ( or equivalently which are subject to a weak tidal field ) , the ratio between the total mass in clusters and the total mass in stars is simply given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the total mass in core gas , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the bound fraction @xmath83 and the sfe averaged over the whole population of clusters , respectively .",

    "measurements of the flux ratio from star clusters relative to field stars in young starbursts combined to improved models accounting , when required , for a significant external tidal field and a non - constant gas - embedded cluster formation rate thus constitute a promising way of probing the local sfe in active star forming environments , without resorting to gas mass estimates .",
    "prerequisites include that the age range of the star cluster system includes the post - violent - relaxation age range , i.e. [ 50,100]myr for a weak tidal field .",

    "because of the observed correlation between the sfr and the visual absolute magnitude of the brightest young cluster @xcite , increased sfrs in turn gives rise to the formation of more massive clusters , which are more likely to survive several gyr of secular evolution .",
    "this is why major star formation episodes of a galaxy are well - traced by peaks in its cluster age distribution .",
    "table [ tab : clusterfrac ] shows , for the models explored in section 2 ( i.e. weak tidal field and constant gas - embedded cluster formation rate ) , the ratio between the total mass in clusters and the total mass in stars formed in gas - embedded clusters over the age range 1 to 100myr ( i.e. this ratio accounts for clusters of which the stellar content is still unaffected by violent relaxation ) .",
    "it appears that these cluster - to - star mass ratios do not sensitively depend on either the standard deviation @xmath17 of the sfe distribution function or the core mass - radius relation .",
    "in contrast , the ratio between the total mass in bound clusters and that in stars ( i.e. the cluster - to - star mass ratio integrated over the age range 50 - 100myr ) _ does _ depend on the fine details and underlying model assumptions , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cfr0.25 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cfr0.40 ] . because an increased bound cluster - to - star mass ratio can be caused by either an increased mean local sfe @xmath127 , an increased sfe distribution function standard deviation @xmath17 , or a shallower core mass - radius relation @xmath128 , the model is prone to degeneracies . as for the mass - radius relation , the influence of gas expulsion on the slope of the cluster mass - radius relation as compared to that of their progenitor cores must be studied . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will apply our model to the data of fig .  1 of @xcite so as to constrain more tightly the distribution function of the local sfe .",
    "that is , we will investigate in greater detail what is the range in local sfe permitted by the data scatter around the linear relation between the logarithm of the present sfr and the visual absolute magnitude of the brightest young cluster in galaxies .",
    "we also remind the reader that our present results are valid only in the case of a weak tidal field .",
    "strong tidal fields both decrease the ability of gas - embedded clusters to survive infant weight - loss and shorten the violent relaxation phase , in essence because a smaller cluster tidal radius enhances cluster loss of stars @xcite .",
    "one way of assessing the tidal field strength in a given ( region of a ) galaxy is to estimate the cluster dissolution time - scale due to secular evolution , based on the age and mass distributions of clusters older than 50myr ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one can then match this time - scale to the external tidal field via equation 7 of @xcite .",
    "finally , our simulations assume that the mass of dense core gas available to star formation per unit of time and the sfr remain constant with time .",
    "if a galaxy is entering a ulirg phase , the amount of dense star forming gas will increase as time goes by , boosting the sfr and cfr at young ages .",
    "should this effect not be corrected for , one could  wrongly  infer that the decrease in the cluster age distribution towards old ages is entirely due to cluster destruction and , therefore , underestimate the local sfe .",
    "building on the @xmath0-body simulation grid recently obtained by @xcite , we have performed detailed simulations of the early ( i.e. up to an age of 100myr ) evolution of star cluster systems . in this first contribution , we have adopted the following assumptions : star forming cores with a power - law mass spectrum of slope @xmath115 , constant gas - embedded cluster formation rate , gaussian distribution function of the local sfe and weak external tidal field . besides , star formation is assumed to mostly take place in gas - embedded clusters . under these assumptions ,",
    "we have highlighted the strong impact of the local sfe on the temporal evolution of the mass in clusters and on the ratio between the total mass in clusters and the total mass in stars . within less than 10myr after gas expulsion , the age distribution of the mass in clusters decreases as a result of cluster violent relaxation and the amplitude of the decline depends strongly on the adopted sfe distribution function .",
    "this is because the fraction of stars remaining bound to a cluster after its violent relaxation is sharply increasing with the sfe @xmath19 once @xmath129  ( fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio @xmath77 between the total mass in stars still bound to the clusters and the total mass in stars formed in gas - embedded clusters over the age range of @xmath130myr constitutes a sensitive probe of the local sfe which characterized their progenitor cores .",
    "besides , this ratio is only weakly affected by the choice of a core mass - radius relation .",
    "we caution however that _ ( i ) _ observationally derived cluster - to - star mass ratios account for detected clusters only ; _",
    "( ii ) _ ratios displayed in table [ tab : clusterfrac ] will be different for other tidal field strengths and non - constant gas - embedded cluster formation history .",
    "measuring the flux ratio given off by star clusters in a young starburst and converting it in a cluster - to - star mass ratio therefore constitutes a promising way of inferring the local sfe , provided that the observed @xmath77 is turned into the actual one and that time - varying gas - embedded cluster formation rate and stronger tidal fields are  if necessary  accounted for via generalized versions of the present model .",
    "another potential application of our model is to trace the evolution of the local sfe over cosmological lookback times .",
    "this can be done , for galaxies close enough so that their field stars can be resolved and age - dated , by comparing the history of the bound cluster formation rate ( i.e. the age distribution of the cluster mass at the end of violent relaxation , obtained by correcting the observed age distribution for secular evolutionary mass losses and fading effects , see e.g. @xcite ) on the one hand and the history of the sfr on the other hand .",
    "this bound cluster - to - star mass ratio is our bound fraction @xmath117 ( see equation [ eq : fbound ] ) , equivalent to model outputs over the age range 50 - 100myr . this application , however , requires tighter constraints on the slope of the core mass - radius relation , the width of the local sfe distribution and an estimate of the external tidal field strength .",
    "combined with the recent finding of @xcite that , on the average , galaxies form 8% of their stars in bound star clusters , the relation between the bound fraction @xmath117 and the local sfe @xmath19 constitutes a hint towards an almost universal local sfe in the present - day universe . in a forthcoming paper , we will apply our model to the observed relation between the present - day sfr of galaxies and the absolute visual magnitude of their brightest young clusters so as to shed better constraints on the present - day local sfe distribution function .",

    "<S> similarly , the mass ratio of stars which remain in bound clusters at the end of the infant mortality / weight - loss phase ( i.e. age @xmath1myr ) depends sensitively on the mean local sfe , although the impacts of the width of the sfe distribution function and of the core mass - radius relation require more careful assessment in this case . </S>",
    "<S> following the recent finding by @xcite that galaxies form , on the average , 8% of their stars in bound clusters regardless of their star formation rate , we raise the hypothesis that star formation in the present - day universe is characterized by a near - universal distribution for the local sfe . a related potential application of our model consists in tracing the evolution of the local sfe over cosmological lookback times by comparing the age distribution of the total mass in star clusters to that in field stars in galaxies where field stars can be resolved and age - dated . </S>",
