    "nonclassical effects have attracted substantial interest during the last decades . in particular",
    "due to the improvements of experimental techniques in the field of quantum optics nonclassical quantum states could be created in practice .",
    "after the first demonstration of photon antibunching  @xcite also sub - poissonian photon statistics  @xcite and quadrature squeezing  @xcite could be realized .    in view of new possibilities of measurement and characterization of quantum states it became possible",
    "to more precisely consider the characterization of nonclassical effects .",
    "the experimental reconstruction of quantum states was demonstrated by balanced homodyne tomography  @xcite and some other methods , for a review see  @xcite . in principle",
    "this allows one to completely characterize the quantum states of elementary quantum systems . on this basis",
    "an old question receives new interest : what are the typical signatures of nonclassical effects ?    besides balanced homodyne detection also homodyne correlation measurements have been considered . in the particular case of a weak local oscillator",
    "it has been shown that the method renders it possible to determine unusual types of moments , such as normally - ordered moments composed of both a field quadrature and the field intensity  @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of these measurement techniques consists in the fact that even for small quantum efficiencies the correlation properties of interest are not smoothed out , as it is known in balanced homodyning  @xcite . for the following",
    "it is of some interest that the experimental determination of homodyne correlations in a multichannel device can be performed in practice  @xcite .",
    "the definition of nonclassicality that is widely accepted in quantum optics is based on the existence of a well - behaved @xmath0-function .",
    "this means that a state is considered to have a classical counterpart if the @xmath0-function has the properties of a probability measure  @xcite , for a nonclassical state it fails to be interpreted as a probability .",
    "however , in addition to this definition also states have been considered to be nonclassical , whose mean photon number is small  @xcite or whose quantum fluctuations are close to the vacuum - noise level  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that nonclassical effects in weak measurements have been considered to appear even for coherent states and for thermal states of small photon numbers  @xcite .",
    "the latter example would support both additional signatures of nonclassicality .",
    "however , the coherent - state example is only consistent with the requirement of the quantum noise being close to the vacuum level  @xcite , it does not require a small photon number .",
    "we also note that nonclassical states having negativities in the wigner function are included in the class of nonclassical states we are dealing with .",
    "let us consider some recent developments of characterizing nonclassical effects of a single - mode quantum state .",
    "the attempt was made to formulate criteria that allow one to relate the nonclassicality to observable quantities .",
    "one approach consists in the use of characteristic functions of the quadrature distributions  @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the nonclassicality criterion formulated in this way was successfully demonstrated in an experiment  @xcite .",
    "later on this criterion turned out to be the lowest order of a hierarchy of necessary and sufficient conditions for nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "this hierarchy is equivalent to the failure of bochner s old criterion for the existence of a classical characteristic function  @xcite , when it is applied to the characteristic function of the @xmath0-function .",
    "more recently the attempt was made to reformulate the notion of nonclassicality in a form which allows us to derive necessary and sufficient conditions in various representations  @xcite .",
    "for example , necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of quadrature moments have been obtained in this manner . these conditions in terms of moments are equivalent to those in terms of characteristic functions and to the failure of the @xmath0-function to be a probability distribution .",
    "the reformulation of the problem in terms of moments includes , as special cases , some previously discussed conditions  @xcite .",
    "the connection of nonclassicality criteria with the @xmath1th hilbert problem has also been considered  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it has been proposed to measure the nonclassicality of a single - mode quantum state via the entanglement potential  @xcite .",
    "this is of particular interest since it shows that the further investigation of the nonclassicality of single - mode quantum states is of importance even for applications that require entangled state .",
    "the aim of the present paper consists in a more general formulation of the conditions for the nonclassicality on the basis of observable moments  @xcite .",
    "three different types of criteria will be analyzed in detail , which are formulated in terms of moments of annihilation and creation operators , of two quadrature operators , and of a quadrature and the number operator . in the latter case",
    "we will also discuss the relation of the criteria to artin s solution of the @xmath1th hilbert problem .",
    "we will show that all the considered moments can be observed in a straightforward manner by homodyne correlation measurements .",
    "as a particular example for the usefulness of the methods under study we consider the characterization and detection of amplitude - squared squeezing  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "necessary and sufficient criteria for the nonclassicality are derived in terms of appropriately chosen moments in sec  ii . in sec .",
    "iii we propose some approaches for the measurement of the moments needed in the new versions of nonclassicality criteria .",
    "special types of sufficient criteria for nonclassicality are consider in sec .",
    "iv , with particular emphasis on the characterization of amplitude - squared squeezing . in sec .",
    "v the concept is illustrated for a special type of minimum - uncertainty amplitude - squared squeezed states .",
    "a summary and some conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the density operator @xmath2 of any quantum state can be written in the diagonal coherent - state representation  @xcite @xmath3 a quantum state is said to be nonclassical if the corresponding @xmath0-function fails to be interpreted as a probability distribution on the complex plane @xcite . since the @xmath0-function may be highly singular , the criterion must be reformulated in terms of measured quantities before it could be applied for the interpretation of experiments .    in the following",
    "we will derive different versions of criteria for the nonclassicality of a quantum state in terms of normally - ordered moments of two appropriately chosen observables",
    ". it will be shown that among the possibilities of choosing two operators that completely describe the algebra of the harmonic oscillator there are at least two choices that lead to necessary and sufficient conditions for nonclassicality in terms of moments , for a brief consideration of one of these two cases see  @xcite .",
    "other choices of operators , however , may only allow one to derive sufficient conditions for the nonclassicality in terms of moments . the reason for this is closely related to artin s solution of the @xmath1th hilbert problem  @xcite .    we will start with a brief review of the reformulation of the nonclassicality criteria in terms of characteristic functions  @xcite . in this manner it became possible to formulate a complete hierarchy of nonclassicality criteria that can be related to experimental data  @xcite .",
    "this approach will also be needed as the basis for a rigorous formulation of criteria in terms of moments .      the characteristic function @xmath4 of @xmath5 , that is its two dimensional fourier transform ,",
    "is defined as @xmath6 it is easy to verify that it obeys the conditions @xmath7 moreover , @xmath4 is a continuous function of @xmath8 for any quantum state .",
    "therefore it obeys all the requirements to apply the following theorem introduced by bochner  @xcite :    : the function @xmath5 is a probability distribution on the complex plane if and only if for any smooth function @xmath9 with compact support the following expression is nonnegative @xmath10    the bochner theorem can also be formulated in a discrete version by replacing the integrations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) with sums .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath5 being a probability measure can thus be reformulated in terms of the characteristic function .",
    "the relation  ( [ eq : phi ] ) is fulfilled , if and only if for any order @xmath11 and for all complex @xmath12 the determinants @xmath13 obey the conditions @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "consequently we arrive at the following theorem  @xcite :    : a quantum state is nonclassical , if and only if there exist values @xmath16 , ( @xmath17 ) for which at least one of the determinants @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) attains negative values : @xmath20    we note that it is straightforward to relate the characteristic functions @xmath4 to observable characteristic functions of quadrature distributions , for more details see  @xcite .      in order to derive criteria for nonclassicality in terms of moments ,",
    "let us start with the normally - ordered expectation value of hermitian operators of the form  @xcite @xmath23 we will consider only such functions @xmath24 of the creation and annihilation operators , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , whose normally - ordered form exists . from the equation above",
    "it immediately follows that on a classical state the mean value is nonnegative for any operator @xmath25 .",
    "hence the occurrence of negative mean values @xmath26 is a clear signature of the nonclassicality of the quantum state under consideration .",
    "let us first derive conditions for classicality in terms of the moments @xmath27 .",
    "the fact that the mean value is nonnegative for any polynomial function @xmath28 of @xmath21 and @xmath22 leads to the nonnegativity of the following quadratic form @xmath29 where the coefficients @xmath30 are considered as independent variables . due to silvester",
    "s criterion it is equivalent to express this condition in terms of the determinants @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 the conditions for classicality than read as @xmath33 to this end , however , these conditions have only been demonstrated to be necessary for the state to be classical . in order to show that they are necessary and sufficient , we will make use of bochner s theorem .    to apply the bochner theorem to moments ,",
    "let us introduce the following operator @xmath25 for any smooth function @xmath9 with compact support : @xmath34 due to the properties of @xmath9 and the following expansion of the normally - ordered displacement operator @xmath35 , @xmath36 the operator is correctly defined and its normally ordered form @xmath37 exists .    the left hand side of the expression   appearing in the bochner theorem is nothing else but the mean value for the operator , @xmath38 on the other hand the mean value @xmath39 can be represented as the following series @xmath40 suppose that all the determinants are nonnegative .",
    "then all finite sums are also nonnegative .",
    "as the series converges , it can be approximated by finite sums and due to this it must be also nonnegative . eventually the bochner theorem states that this is equivalent to the nonnegativity of the @xmath0-function or the classicality of the state under consideration .",
    "consequently we formulate another theorem for the nonclassicality of a quantum state :    : a quantum state is nonclassical if and only if at least one of the determinants @xmath31 violates the condition  ( [ eq : daa - cl ] ) , that is @xmath41    note that @xmath42 represent the incoherent part of the photon number , @xmath43 since this quantity is always nonnegative it yields no condition for nonclassicality .",
    "it is possible to formulate other ( sufficient ) conditions for nonclassicality by considering subdeterminants of @xmath31 .",
    "these subdeterminants are obtained by any pairwise cancellation of such lines and columns in @xmath31 that cross in a diagonal element of the matrix .",
    "the negativity of any such subdeterminant is a sufficient condition for nonclassicality",
    ". criteria of this type may be useful for characterizing the nonclassical properties of special quantum states .",
    "examples for such subdeterminants and for states that can be properly characterized by the resulting sufficient conditions will be studied in sec .",
    "let us now consider two quadrature operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as the quadrature operators are defined as linear combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath21 , the latter can be simply expressed in terms of the quadratures as @xmath46 one can reformulate the criteria for nonclassicality in terms of the normally - ordered moments @xmath47 of the quadratures , as has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "we note that instead of using @xmath44 and @xmath45 the criteria could also be formulated with two arbitrary noncommuting quadratures @xmath44 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this more general form of the criteria is simply obtained by replacing @xmath45 with @xmath48 in the criteria derived below .    in the following",
    "we will make use of the fact that any operator @xmath25 whose normally - ordered form exists can be written as a normally - ordered power series with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath51 it is important that we use normally ordering here .",
    "an expansion of @xmath25 of the same structure , but the normally - ordered terms @xmath52 being replaced with @xmath53 , may not exist . from the representation",
    "it follows that the state is classical if and only if all the determinants @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 are nonnegative : @xmath56    consequently , the criteria for nonclassicality can be equivalently formulated by the following theorem :    : a quantum state is nonclassical if and only if at least one of the determinants @xmath54 violates the condition  ( [ eq : dxp - cl ] ) , that is @xmath57    in this version already the condition @xmath58 gives insight into the nonclassicality of quantum states .",
    "it represents the condition for quadrature squeezing , @xmath59 note that from the nonclassicality conditions in eq .",
    "( [ cond - xp ] ) together with  ( [ eq : dxp ] ) we may derive further conditions by pairwise cancellation of such lines and columns in the determinants that cross in the main diagonal .",
    "for example one may formulate conditions such as @xmath60 conditions formulated in terms of such subdeterminants in some cases may be more efficient to describe particular nonclassical effects as the formal application of the hierarchy of the determinants @xmath31 , for an example see  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to use other pairs of operators that together with the unit operator generate the whole operator algebra of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "let us consider the position operator @xmath44 and the photon number operator @xmath61 .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators @xmath22 and @xmath21 are expressed in terms of the @xmath44 and @xmath61 as follows @xmath62)e^{i \\varphi } , \\quad      \\hat{a}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{x}_\\varphi - [ \\hat{x}_\\varphi , \\hat{n}])e^{-i \\varphi}.\\ ] ] in the present case , however , we need to use the commutation relation @xmath63 = 1 $ ] to express the operators @xmath22 , @xmath21 in terms of @xmath44 , @xmath61 .",
    "therefore it is no longer possible to substitute the expressions into the expansion and to rewrite the normally - ordered form of the operator @xmath25 in terms of normally - ordered expressions in @xmath44 and @xmath61 as follows : @xmath64 to make this more clear , already a linear term in  , such as @xmath65 , has no representation in the form of eq .  .",
    "as a consequence of this fact one can not conclude that the determinants that are similar to and , but with the moments @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , form a complete hierarchy of criteria .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "the not - existence of a representation of the form   for a general operator prevents one from relating these determinants to the bochner theorem .",
    "thus the corresponding determinants do not lead to necessary and sufficient conditions for nonclassicality .",
    "because of this situation we will formulate only necessary conditions for classicality or , the other way around , we will derive sufficient conditions for nonclassicality in terms of the moments @xmath69 .",
    "the mean value of the normally - ordered operator @xmath70 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath0-function as @xmath71 for any classical state and for any operator @xmath72 with a nonnegative associated c - number function @xmath73 with @xmath74 together with the special form @xmath25 given in eq .",
    ", we derive necessary conditions for classicality in terms of the determinants @xmath75 as @xmath76 consequently , if @xmath77 the nonclassical properties of the considered quantum state have been verified by a sufficient but not necessary condition .",
    "the latter can be illustrated as follows . there",
    "@xmath72 of different kind whose associated @xmath78-number function @xmath79 is nonnegative .",
    "let us consider @xmath80 it is clear that the corresponding function is nonnegative @xmath81 this leads to the following necessary conditions for the nonnegativity of the @xmath0-function : @xmath82 which is formulated in terms of the determinants @xmath83 with @xmath84    consequently , the violation of the nonnegativity of one such determinant , @xmath85 is sufficient to demonstrate the nonclassical behavior of a quantum state .",
    "note that these conditions already characterize nonclassical effects by the first order determinant @xmath86 . by inspection of its expression , @xmath87 we observe that the condition @xmath88 reproduces the condition for quadrature squeezing provided that @xmath89 , that is for quantum states whose mean amplitude is vanishing , as for example in a squeezed vacuum state .",
    "in his famous address to the 1900 international congress of mathematicians hilbert formulated 23 problems that he considered to be the most important problems to be solved in the following century .",
    "the 17th problem , in its simplest form , was solved by artin in 1926 .",
    "artin s solution can be formulated in the following theorem  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    : any nonnegative polynomial @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 can be represented as a finite sum of squares of rational functions @xmath92 where @xmath93 , i. e. @xmath94 and all @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 are polynomials @xmath98.\\ ] ]    this theorem is useful for getting deeper insight in the general problem of formulating conditions for the nonclassicality of quantum states in such cases as discussed in the preceding subsection . for this purpose",
    "let us consider the nonnegativity condition to be fulfilled for any quantum state that has a classical counterpart .",
    "let us restrict the class of functions @xmath99 , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "to polynomials .",
    "now we may formulate the nonclassicality conditions in terms of the operators @xmath44 and @xmath61 by using artin s solution of the 17th hilbert problem as follows : @xmath102 that is , the condition for nonclassicality leads to normally - ordered expectation values of fractions of squares of polynomials .",
    "the extension of the conditions beyond polynomial functions is not obvious , nor it is straightforward to formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for nonclassicality in terms of normally - ordered moments of @xmath44 and @xmath61 .",
    "also other types of operators , even if they render it possible to span the algebra of the harmonic oscillator by using commutation rules , are expected to lead to similar problems .    in the cases of the operators",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 on one hand and @xmath44 and @xmath45 on the other hand these problems do not exist .",
    "the general form of functions according to the solution of the 17 .",
    "hilbert problem is not needed due to the direct relation of the considered expectation values @xmath103 to the bochner theorem .",
    "this allowed us to directly formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonclassicality in terms of the moments of these operator . in the following",
    "we will consider the possibilities to measure these moments .",
    "this eventually allows one to characterize nonclassical states by measurable moments .",
    "in the preceding section we have considered the formulation of criteria for the nonclassicality of quantum states in terms of moments .",
    "such criteria are only of practical interest if one can design measurement principles that allow one to determine the corresponding moments .",
    "since these schemes will depend on the types of moments , we will consider them separately .",
    "all these detection schemes will be based on homodyne correlation measurements .",
    "an important advantage of such measurements consists in the fact that the accessible information on a quantum state is not smoothed out be small detection efficiencies .",
    "for the first time homodyne correlation measurements with a weak local oscillator have been proposed for measuring squeezing and anomalous moments , containing nonequal powers in the annihilation and creation operators , in resonance fluorescence  @xcite .",
    "this measurement principle was studied in more detail  @xcite , where the detection of quantum correlations of the photon number and a quadrature operator has been analyzed . later on such measurements have also been considered for determining particular nonclassical properties of light  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will modify the method in such a way that it becomes possible to determine the different types of moments considered in the preceding section .",
    "let us consider the detection scheme presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : moments ] . as an example we have shown a measurement scheme of depth @xmath105 , where the depth is the number of beam splitters between the entrance beam splitter @xmath106 and any of the detectors @xmath107 .",

    "the measurement device could be further extended to an arbitrary value of depth @xmath109 .",

    "the strength of the local oscillator on the detectors is typically of the same order of magnitude as the signal field , which is easily realized with a weakly reflecting entrance beam splitter .",

    "most importantly , all the quantities under study are accessible to observation .",
