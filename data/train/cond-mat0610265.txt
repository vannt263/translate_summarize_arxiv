    "over the last fifteen years , the dynamics of glassforming liquids under nanoscale confinement has attracted much attention .",
    "a great variety of molecular systems under many different types of confinement has been subjected to virtually all available experimental techniques , while at the same time extensive studies of simple model systems using molecular dynamics simulations were undertaken @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this rapidly growing interest is that confinement is considered as a potential tool to investigate the concept of cooperativity , a key ingredient of many glass transition theories @xcite . indeed , there are now many evidences that the dynamics of deeply supercooled liquids is inhomogeneous and that dynamically correlated groups of molecules play a crucial role in the slowing - down of the dynamics when the temperature is decreased .",
    "but , up to now , many questions pertaining , for instance , to the shape , size or temperature evolution of these dynamical heterogeneities remain essentially unanswered ( for recent progress , see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in confinement ,",
    "geometric constraints associated with the pore shape are imposed to the adsorbed fluid and new characteristic length scales , like the pore size , come into play .",
    "thus , by looking for alterations in the dynamics under confinement compared to the bulk , one can hope to pinpoint some of the elusive characteristic features of the dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "for instance , in the simplest scenarios , deviations from the bulk behavior are expected to occur due to finite size effects , when the typical size of the dynamical heterogeneities in the bulk would become larger than the pore size .",
    "confinement effects would thus provide a ruler to measure dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "the situation actually turns out more complex .",
    "indeed , a direct comparison between the bulk and confined fluids is only meaningful if the physical phenomena which are specific to confinement have a weak impact on the properties of the imbibed fluid or at least if their influence is sufficiently well understood that it can be corrected for .",
    "this is usually not so and strong confinement effects are often observed , for instance , the formation of structured layers of almost immobile molecules at the fluid - solid interface .",
    "so , in fact , dynamics in confinement should be addressed as a problem of its own , not necessarily with reference to the bulk .",
    "the variety of the systems to consider is immense .",
    "porous media can differ in the size , shape and topology of their pore space .",
    "they can be made of various materials or receive different surface treatments , leading to a wide range of fluid - solid interactions which adds to the already great variability of the intermolecular interactions met with usual glassformers .",
    "thus , owing to the complexity of the field , a reasonable microscopic theory , able to catch at least some of these aspects , could be very helpful .",
    "indeed , applied to various models , it would allow to explore thoroughly the phenomenology of confined glassforming liquids and maybe to disentangle the contributions of the different physical phenomena which interplay in these systems .    many porous media , like controlled porous glasses and aerogels , are disordered . in the past few years ,",
    "a very useful and quite successful model to deal with this kind of systems has been the so - called `` quenched - annealed '' ( qa ) binary mixture , first introduced by madden and glandt @xcite . in this model , sketched in fig .",
    "[ figsketch ] , the fluid molecules ( the annealed component ) equilibrate in a matrix of particles frozen in a disordered configuration sampled from a given probability distribution ( the quenched component ) . the matrix is assumed to be statistically homogeneous , so that , while for any single realization , the system lacks translational and rotational invariance , all expectation values computed with the matrix probability distribution will have the same properties as in a truly translationally and rotationally invariant system . a common , but not unique ,",
    "prescription is to take the equilibrium distribution of some simple fluid system , so that the various samples of the matrix can be thought of as the results of instantaneous thermal quenches of this original equilibrium system , hence the denomination `` quenched '' for the matrix component .",
    "thanks to the assumption of statistical homogeneity , as far as the computation of matrix averaged quantities is concerned , qa mixtures can be studied with great ease using simple extensions of standard liquid state theoretical methods .",
    "this has been put to good use to derive equations describing the structure and the thermodynamics of these systems , either via diagrammatic techniques @xcite or by application of the replica trick @xcite .",
    "sketch of a qa system . in black , the immobile matrix particles . in white , with arrows symbolizing their movement , the fluid particles . ]",
    "the aim of the present work is now to develop a dynamical theory for qa mixtures , able to deal with the problem of the glass transition in confinement .",
    "this will take the form of an extension to qa systems of the ideal mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for the liquid - glass transition @xcite .",
    "the mct occupies a central place in the study of the dynamics of supercooled liquids in the bulk , as one of the very few available microscopic theories in this field .",
    "it has well known deficiencies , in particular the fact that its predicted sharp ergodicity breaking transition , the so - called ideal glass transition , is always located in the regime of weak to mild supercooling , rather far from the calorimetric glass transition point .",
    "but , quite remarkably , it has been able to correctly predict novel nontrivial relaxation patterns which develop in systems like colloidal suspensions with short - ranged attractions @xcite or fluids of symmetric dumbbells @xcite , when the parameters of these models are varied .",
    "it seems thus sensible to turn to this theoretical framework for a systematic investigation of confined glassforming liquids , aiming at understanding , at least qualitatively , how the microscopic details of the fluid - solid system impact its dynamics .",
    "moreover , it is encouraging that recent computer simulation data for confined fluids could be interpreted with the universal predictions of the mct @xcite , showing that the mode - coupling glass transition scenario might indeed be of some relevance in confinement as well .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite precisely deals with a qa system , as do refs .",
    "@xcite , where other simulation studies are reported .",
    "theories related to the one to be derived have already been discussed in the literature .",
    "the mode - coupling approach to the diffusion - localization transition in the classical random lorentz gas @xcite is of particular relevance , since this system is actually a qa mixture taken in the limit of a vanishing density of the annealed component . besides",
    ", the present theory will borrow some ideas from this approach .",
    "other works have dealt with the conductor - insulator transition of quantum fluids in random potentials , originally neglecting the fluid - fluid interactions @xcite which were later reintroduced by thakur and neilson @xcite .",
    "they appear as special cases of the present theory , with additional implicit and uncontrolled approximations in the treatment of the effect of randomness on the static fluid correlations @xcite .",
    "finally , a similar nonlinear feedback mechanism has been derived for the freezing of a polymer chain in a quenched random medium using the self - consistent hartree approximation for the langevin dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the mct equations for the collective dynamics of a qa mixture are derived and discussed , while sec .",
    "iii explores the relation between the dynamics in a self - induced glassy phase and in a quenched random environment . in sec .",
    "iv , dynamical phase diagrams for two simple models are computed , which show two basic types of ideal liquid - glass transitions discussed in more details in sec .  v. section vi is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "preliminary reports on the present work can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section , the mode - coupling equations for the qa binary mixture are derived and discussed .",
    "but , before proceeding with the dynamical theory , a few static quantities have to be defined .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in a qa system , the disordered porous medium is represented by a collection of @xmath0 rigorously immobile point particles , randomly placed in a volume @xmath1 at positions denoted by @xmath2 , according to a given probability distribution @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "its overall density is @xmath4 and the fourier components of its frozen microscopic density , or , in short , its frozen density fluctuations , are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the wavevector .",
    "their disorder - averaged correlation functions , which , because of the assumed statistical homogeneity , are diagonal in @xmath6 and only depend on its modulus @xmath7 , define the matrix structure factor @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes an average over the matrix realizations .",
    "the fluid component consists of @xmath10 point particles ( density @xmath11 ) of mass @xmath12 , which equilibrate at a temperature @xmath13 in the random potential energy landscape created by the frozen matrix particles . as in the bulk , for the present theory",
    ", we will be interested in the dynamics of the fluid density fluctuations @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the position of the fluid particle @xmath16 at time @xmath17 . at equal times",
    ", they allow to define the fluid structure factor @xmath18 and the fluid - matrix structure factor @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes a thermal average _ taken for a given realization of the matrix _ ,",
    "the disorder average @xmath9 being performed _",
    "subsequently_.    for an ordinary binary mixture , the knowledge of the above three structure factors would be enough to fully characterize the structure at the pair level .",
    "this is not the case for a qa mixture . indeed , because the matrix component is quenched , for any single realization , the system lacks translational and rotational invariance .",
    "it results that , at variance with a bulk fluid , non - zero average density fluctuations exist at equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "it is only after averaging over disorder that the symmetry is restored , so that @xmath22 .",
    "thus , one is led to consider relaxing and non - relaxing fluid density fluctuations , corresponding to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and to define the connected fluid structure factor @xmath25 and the disconnected or blocked fluid structure factor @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "this splitting of the fluid pair correlations is well known from the replica theory of qa systems , where it leads to the peculiar structure of the so - called replica ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equations @xcite , which are given in appendix [ app.oz ] for reference .",
    "non - zero average fluid density fluctuations at equilibrium mean that , even without any dynamical ergodicity breaking , they will have time - persistent correlations . indeed , defining the normalized total density fluctuation autocorrelation function @xmath28",
    "one expects using standard arguments that @xmath29 this is a general consequence of the fact that the fluid evolves in an inhomogeneous environment and we stress that this is a true static phenomenon .    usually , mode - coupling theories are derived assuming that the statics of the problem is solved . for this reason , since the calculation of the contribution from the blocked correlations is actually a static problem , the theory has been developed using the relaxing part of the fluid density fluctuations as the central dynamical variable .",
    "attempts to derive a dynamical theory starting from the full density fluctuations have resulted in complicated equations , which appeared unfaithful to the statics of the problem , and thus were abandoned .",
    "the theory is derived using standard projection operator methods , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for bulk systems . as usual , in a first step , one obtains a generalized langevin equation for the time evolution of the normalized connected autocorrelation function of the density fluctuations @xmath30 it is formally the same as for the bulk , i.e. , @xmath31 with initial conditions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34    the second step involves the calculation of the slow decaying portion of the memory kernel @xmath35 with a mode - coupling approach .",
    "we will assume that the slow dynamics is dominated by three types of quadratic variables , which can be separated in two classes .",
    "in the first class , we have variables quadratic in the relaxing density fluctuations , @xmath36 , in close analogy with bulk mct @xcite . in the second class , inspired by previous studies on the lorentz gas @xcite",
    ", we consider variables expressing couplings of the relaxing density fluctuations to the two frozen density fluctuations present in the problem , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the last variable was omitted in all previous works , including a recent account of the present theory @xcite , with consequences to be discussed below .",
    "the calculation is outlined in appendix [ app.derivation ] and we only quote the result here .",
    "it reads @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a friction coefficient associated with fast dynamical processes , and @xmath41,\\ ] ] with    [ vertices ] @xmath42 ^ 2 s^{c}_k s^{c}_{|\\mathbf{q - k}|},\\ ] ] and @xmath43 ^ 2 s^{c}_k s^{b}_{|\\mathbf{q - k}|},\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 , the fourier transform of the connected direct correlation function , has been introduced .",
    "based on these equations , a few general comments are in order .",
    "first of all , the derived expressions retain the mathematical structure of the typical mode - coupling equations which have been extensively studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus , all known properties of the solutions of mct equations , in particular near the transition , apply in the case of the qa mixture .",
    "a significant addition compared to the bulk is however the presence of a linear term in the memory function , which opens the possibility of continuous ideal glass transitions .",
    "like in the theory for the bulk , which is recovered in the limit @xmath45 , the slow dynamics is fully determined by smoothly varying static quantities .",
    "interestingly , no explicit reference to the matrix is visible in the equations .",
    "indeed , the only required information is @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath44 , i.e. , quantities characterizing the fluid component of the qa system .",
    "these functions and the relations between them are generically meaningful for the description of fluids evolving in statistically homogeneous random environments and they are by no means restricted to the model of the qa mixture ( for the case of non - particle - based random fields , see refs .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the present dynamical theory shares the same degree of generality and is applicable in its present form out of the strict context of the qa binary mixture .",
    "in fact , this shows up nicely in the process of deriving the equations , since one finds that the contributions resulting from the coupling of the random forces to @xmath37 are identically zero ( see appendix [ app.derivation ] ) .",
    "thus , it is enough to consider only two types of quadratic variables , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , precisely those which are not specific to qa systems , to obtain the same dynamical equations .",
    "further evidence of the generic character of the present equations is given in appendix [ app.pspin ] , where the dynamics of a mean - field spin - glass model in a random magnetic field is shown to obey equations with exactly the same structure .",
    "along the same line , it is noteworthy that the total fluid structure factor @xmath51 does not appear in the derived dynamical equations .",
    "only @xmath47 and @xmath48 do .",
    "it results that , in the framework of the mct , the global fluid correlations are of limited relevance to discuss the relation between the statics and the dynamics .",
    "a much more important aspect is rather the balance between the connected and disconnected contributions to these correlations .",
    "this result is very welcome , since similar differences in the roles played by these three types of correlations are known to be crucial in the physics of qa systems .",
    "this is best illustrated by the compressibility sum rule @xcite , which precisely involves @xmath47 and not @xmath51 , as one would naively expect from the relation for the bulk .",
    "it is thus reassuring that this feature has been preserved despite the uncontrolled approximations involved in the derivation of the theory .",
    "moreover , this finding allows one to clarify the issues raised in refs .",
    "@xcite about the possibility of a description of the dynamics in confinement with theories based on structural quantities only .",
    "indeed , it was observed there that systems with identical global fluid correlations could have significantly different dynamics , a result which appeared as a challenge to such approaches .",
    "the present mct shows that this is not necessarily so and that one should also consider the connected and blocked correlations before a conclusion can be reached .",
    "about the form of the vertices , one can note the familiar expression of @xmath52 , which measures the coupling of the random forces to @xmath49 .",
    "it is the same as in a bulk system , with connected quantities simply replacing the fluid structure factor and direct correlation function .",
    "this is true for @xmath53 , given by eq .",
    ", as well .",
    "thus , we find that the relaxing part of the density fluctuations in a qa system just behaves dynamically like the corresponding degree of freedom in the bulk .",
    "this is not really surprising , since a similar correspondence is already visible in the statics , for instance in the oz equation or in the convolution approximation , which are both used in the calculation of @xmath52 .",
    "such a correspondence was missing in all our attempts to derive a mct starting from the total density fluctuations and this is one of the reasons for which the resulting equations were considered unsatisfactory .",
    "@xmath54 is less obvious and combines features of @xmath52 and of the vertex for the tagged particle dynamics in the bulk @xcite . in particular , like the latter , it diverges when @xmath55 .    finally , the above equations differ slightly from those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a first account of the theory was given .",
    "there , @xmath56 in eq .",
    "is replaced by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the fourier transform of the blocked direct correlation function .",
    "the only difference between the two approaches is that @xmath59 was not included as a slow variable in the earlier mode - coupling scheme .",
    "a priori , this is an unjustified approximation . indeed ,",
    "as shown in appendix [ app.derivation ] , the coupling to this variable is actually so strong , that , when both @xmath60 and @xmath50 are considered , the contribution of the former becomes identically zero , while the effect of the random environment is integrally transferred to the latter .",
    "there are nevertheless circumstances in which the absence of @xmath59 looks perfectly well motivated , for instance when a single particle is moving in the porous matrix , corresponding to the limit @xmath61 , or when the adsorbed fluid is an ideal gas @xcite . in both cases",
    ", the present mct reduces to @xmath62 and @xmath63 ^ 2 \\hat{h}^{b}_{|\\mathbf{q - k}| } \\phi_{k}(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the fourier transform of the blocked total pair correlation function .",
    "but , since the only forces exerted on the fluid are those due to the random matrix , on physical grounds , the only mode - coupling contributions to the relaxation kernel are expected to come from @xmath65 .",
    "all previous theories of the lorentz gas have been based on this insight , which leads to the same equations as above , except that @xmath66 in eq .",
    "is replaced with @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "note that , for an adsorbed ideal gas , both theories correctly predict that the dynamics is independent of @xmath46 .",
    "it seems thus that there is a subtle interplay between the approximations involved in the derivation of the mct and the peculiar structure of the static correlations in the qa mixture . at present , it is not clear what to conclude from this observation , but it is interesting that the difference between the two mct schemes involves the blocked direct correlation function @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is a rather delicate object , not easily captured by simple approximations .",
    "this is best understood in the replica framework , where @xmath68 is obtained as the zero replica limit of the direct correlation function between two non - interacting fluid replicas only correlated through their common interaction with the matrix @xcite .",
    "it results that @xmath68 has a highly non - additive character and that , for instance , most simple closures of the replica oz equations fail to provide expressions for this function which do not vanish identically .",
    "thus , it is a rather nontrivial finding that the mct approximation scheme is actually sensitive to the existence of this function .",
    "from the previous discussion , it is clear that the separation of the fluid density fluctuations into relaxing and frozen parts plays a crucial role in the derivation of the mct for qa systems . in that case , the freezing is of static origin , due to the random external field generated by the quenched matrix .",
    "but , as it is well known from the mct for bulk fluids , freezing of the density fluctuations may also occur dynamically , when the system enters in the ideal glassy state .",
    "it seems thus interesting to compare both situations .",
    "this can be seen as a case of self - induced versus quenched disorder , similar to what has been discussed many times in the literature @xcite .",
    "the residual relaxation of a bulk fluid in its ideal glassy state has been studied in ref .",
    "it is described by mode - coupling equations of the same form as above , except that the characteristic frequency is given by @xmath69 and the vertices are    [ verticesresidual ] @xmath70 ^ 2 \\left\\{(1-f_k ) s_k\\right\\ } \\left\\{(1-f_{|\\mathbf{q - k}| } ) s_{|\\mathbf{q - k}|}\\right\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath71 ^ 2 \\left\\{(1-f_k ) s_k \\right\\ } \\left\\ { f_{|\\mathbf{q - k}| } s_{|\\mathbf{q - k}| } \\right\\},\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the density of the fluid , @xmath72 its structure factor , @xmath73 the fourier transform of its direct correlation function , and @xmath74 the debye - waller factor of the glass .",
    "accordingly , @xmath75 corresponds to the dynamically frozen part of the density fluctuations , while @xmath76 corresponds to their relaxing part .    the analogies between these equations and eqs .   and are striking .",
    "there is almost a perfect correspondence between @xmath76 and @xmath77 on the one hand , and @xmath75 and @xmath78 on the other hand .",
    "thus , we find that , irrespective of the mechanism of freezing of the fluid density fluctuations , the resulting relaxing and frozen contributions essentially play the same role in both systems .",
    "but there remains one significant difference between both sets of equations .",
    "indeed , one of the fourier transformed direct correlation functions in eq .  , the one which carries the same wavevector as the frozen part of the structure factor , is replaced by a simple constant factor @xmath79 in eq .  .",
    "the origin of this constant term should probably be traced back to the asymmetric nature of the qa system , where the fluid reacts to the matrix but not the other way around , resulting in a non - equilibrium character of its static and dynamical correlations , in the sense that the matrix is not equilibrated with the fluid .",
    "it would then reflect the lack of dynamical self - consistency between the glassy dynamics in a qa system and the frozen background on top of which it develops .",
    "it is tempting to try and obtain the mct for the qa binary mixture as a limiting case of the mct for the ordinary binary mixture @xcite , where one component would become the quenched matrix .",
    "the above discussion shows that this is not possible .",
    "indeed , based on heuristic considerations , one can get close to eqs .",
    "and , for instance by canceling all terms which would result in a time dependence of the fluid - matrix and matrix - matrix correlations , but the non - equilibrium density factor identified above seems impossible to generate from the theory for the fully annealed system .",
    "thus , as far as the development of theoretical approaches is concerned , and this statement is probably not restricted to the mct framework , the dynamics of a qa system should definitely be considered from the start as different from an infinite mass ( for newtonian systems ) or a zero bare diffusivity ( for brownian dynamics ) limit of the dynamics of a fully annealed mixture .",
    "this is actually not so unexpected since , already in the statics , similar difficulties were met in early attempts to derive the equations valid for the qa mixture starting from those describing fully equilibrated systems ( see the discussion of refs .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "thus , the present theory is not a special case of earlier mode - coupling studies of the dynamics of particles moving in a glassy matrix @xcite . there ,",
    "the mct for binary mixtures was used in a regime where one component , made of big particles , was completely glassy , i.e. , both the collective and tagged particle correlators did not relax to zero , while the other component , made of small spheres , was not necessarily localized , i.e. , the tagged particle correlators could relax to zero .",
    "in fact , both theories are complementary . in the early approach",
    ", the glassy matrix has to be the product of the self - consistent mode - coupling dynamics , but the model incorporates thermal fluctuations of the solid and aspects of its response to the presence of the fluid , while in the present approach , one has much more freedom to choose the structure of the confining medium , including realistic models of porous solids @xcite , but the disordered matrix is rigorously inert .",
    "there are anyway qualitative analogies between both models .",
    "for instance , there is a clear link between the fact that the collective motion of the small particles in a binary mixture necessarily becomes non ergodic at the same point as that of the big particles and the unavoidable existence of static blocked correlations for a fluid in a random matrix .",
    "we now move to the quantitative predictions of the theory , which require numerical solutions of the mct equations . in this section",
    ", we report dynamical phase diagrams , obtained by mapping , in the parameter space of a given model , the domain where @xmath80 , corresponding to the ergodic fluid phase , and the one where @xmath81 , corresponding to the non - ergodic ideal glassy state .",
    "the interface between the two domains forms the ideal liquid - glass transition manifold ; in the present work , it will always be a line , since only systems with a two - dimensional parameter space are considered .",
    "details of the dynamical changes when crossing this line are discussed in the next section .    as already mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , a significant difference between the mct equations for qa systems and those for bulk glassformers is the presence of a linear term in the memory kernel .",
    "it results that the discontinuous or type b transition scenario known from the bulk , where the infinite time limit of @xmath82 jumps discontinuously from zero to a finite value when going from the liquid to the glass , is not the only possibility anymore .",
    "continuous or type a transition scenarios , where @xmath74 grows continuously from zero when entering the glassy phase , indeed become possible .",
    "this is best understood by reference to the so - called @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) schematic models @xcite , in which the time evolution of a single correlation function @xmath85 is ruled by a two parameter memory kernel of the form @xmath86 it can be readily shown that , when the second term dominates ( @xmath87 small ) , these models have a line of type b transitions starting at @xmath88 , and , when the first term dominates ( @xmath89 small ) , they have a line of type a transitions starting at @xmath90 .",
    "the study of the @xmath83 models also gives us information on the possible topologies of the dynamical phase diagrams , which depend on the way the transition lines meet .",
    "two simple cases are found @xcite . if @xmath91 , the two lines join smoothly at a common endpoint , where a topologically stable degenerate @xmath92 singularity is located .",
    "if @xmath93 , the two lines intersect and , in the glassy domain , only the extension of the type b transition line subsists beyond the intersection , forming a glass - glass transition line terminated by an ordinary @xmath92 singularity .",
    "it turns out that these two prototypical shapes of phase diagrams are obtained with two very simple , closely related qa mixture models , to which the present study is restricted . in both ,",
    "the fluid - fluid and fluid - matrix interactions are pure hard core repulsions of the same diameter @xmath94 .",
    "the only difference lies in the matrix correlations . in model",
    "i , the matrix configurations are assumed to be quenched from an equilibrium fluid of hard spheres of diameter @xmath94 , so that the matrix particles do not overlap , while in model ii the matrix particles are completely uncorrelated and overlap freely . in the following",
    ", both systems will be parametrized by the two dimensionless densities @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation @xcite will be used to compute the required structural quantities .",
    "note that , in this approximation , @xmath97 , so that the difficulties mentioned at the end of sec .",
    "ii are irrelevant .",
    "the non - ergodicity parameter @xmath74 is a solution of the nonlinear set of equations @xmath98,\\ ] ] which has to be solved numerically in order to locate the liquid and glassy phases when @xmath99 and @xmath100 are varied .",
    "all computations in the present work have been achieved using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , to which the interested reader is referred for technical details , and we only provide the quantitative information needed to reproduce the present results , i.e. , that the wavevector integrals have been discretized to points on a grid of @xmath101 equally spaced values with step size @xmath102 , starting at @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "we have checked by two means that this discretization is not too coarse , in particular with respect to the small @xmath7 divergence of the memory kernel which is cut off .",
    "first , test calculations at various fluid and matrix densities have been performed on a finer @xmath7 grid , hence with a smaller @xmath104 .",
    "second , in the @xmath61 limit , we have compared our prediction for the diffusion - localization point of model i with leutheusser s analytic result obtained within an additional hydrodynamic approximation which allows to integrate exactly over the full @xmath7 range @xcite .",
    "in all cases , only modest quantitative differences of a few percents on the location of the transition points were found .        when dealing with complex transition scenarios , including higher - order singularities and glass - glass transition lines , a useful quantity to consider is the largest eigenvalue @xmath105 of the stability matrix of the set of equations .",
    "indeed , there holds @xmath106 , and @xmath105 goes to @xmath107 when a transition is approached from the strong coupling side @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath108 can be used as a convergence criterion for the determination of the transition points @xcite . in this work , @xmath109 was assured for ordinary transition points and @xmath110 was required in the regions where the transition lines of types a and b meet .    the dynamical phase diagrams of models i and ii are reported in fig .  [ figtrans ] .",
    "in the left panel , they are plotted in the @xmath111 plane .",
    "this is the obvious parameter space of the problem , but , with this choice of variables , no account is given of the differences in structure between the two matrix models .",
    "this clearly limits the possibilities of a meaningful comparison between the two systems .",
    "thus , in the right panel , both qa mixtures have been tentatively parametrized by the same physical constant , their henry constant @xmath112 . for systems with hard core interactions ,",
    "@xmath112 is equal to the fraction of the total volume accessible to the center of an adsorbate particle in a matrix of density @xmath100 and is probably the most simple and generic scalar quantity characterizing the confining effect of a solid matrix on an adsorbed fluid .",
    "it is given by @xmath113 for model ii @xcite , and by @xmath114 $ ] for model i , where @xmath115 is the excess chemical potential of the equilibrium hard sphere fluid with volume fraction @xmath100 @xcite .",

    "the interpretation of this finding is ambiguous . on the one hand , since a higher - order singularity is found on the transition line computed with @xmath126 as well , one might argue that the singularity should be considered as an integral part of the scenario of caging by fluid particles .",

    "iii ) or for the equilibrium dynamics of a mean - field spin - glass in a random magnetic field ( appendix [ app.pspin ] ) . thus , from a formal point of view",
    ", the theory appears rather satisfactory .",
    "nevertheless , a few difficulties remain . first , there is the fact that , in the limit of vanishing fluid - fluid interactions , the present theory does not coincide with the mct which can be derived by assuming from the start that there are no such interactions .",
    "second , there is the divergence of the memory kernel for small wavevectors and the resulting spurious long time anomalies @xcite .",
    "we do not believe that these issues are really harmful , even if their handling requires ad hoc approximations , but they are worth stressing , since their solutions would probably teach us something on the nature of the approximations underlying the mct scheme and on possible extensions of the theory .",
    "for instance , it has been argued by leutheusser that the inclusion of vertex corrections within a kinetic theory approach would solve the second problem , but no operational scheme was proposed for this calculation @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of the mct equations for two simple fluid - matrix models leads to a variety of transition scenarios , which are either discontinuous for dilute matrices or continuous for dense matrices .",
    "depending on the model , in the intermediate region where the nature of the transition changes , degenerate or genuine higher - order singularities and glass - glass transition lines are found .",
    "another remarkable prediction of the theory is the possibility of a reentry phenomenon for high matrix densities above the localization threshold , which has been interpreted as the signature of a decorrelation process induced by fluid - fluid collisions .    before going further",
    ", one should note that , strictly speaking , this prediction of the theory can not be correct in the case of hard core fluid - matrix interactions .",
    "indeed , as recently confirmed by extensive computer simulations of the lorentz gas @xcite , the localization transition is driven by the percolation transition of the matrix void space , i.e. , localization occurs because , above a certain critical matrix density @xmath186 , the void space only consists of finite disconnected domains .",
    "in such a scenario , it is obvious that , whatever the fluid density , it is impossible to have an ergodic system above @xmath186 , since fluid - fluid interactions will never change the geometry of the matrix .",
    "this contradiction between the percolation theory and the mct clearly raises the issue of the relation between the two approaches , for which we propose the following simple argument .",
    "the mct applied to the problem of the diffusion - localization transition attempts to capture the onset of percolation in an indirect way , by giving an account of the increasingly correlated nature of the fluid - matrix collision events as the threshold is approached . in this respect , one should note that none of the static structure functions on which it is based does show a sensitivity to the phenomenon of percolation .",
    "following leutheusser , the theory works at the level of a self - consistent treatment of ring collision processes @xcite .",
    "this turns out to be enough to predict a diffusion - localization transition , but , clearly , the infinite sequences of correlated collisions which would really reflect the permanent trapping of the fluid particle in a finite domain above the percolation threshold are missing . from this incomplete characterization of the dynamical processes escorting the percolation phenomenon",
    ", it results that the mct diffusion - localization transition is actually an ideal version of the true percolation transition , in the usual sense that the mct predicts ideal glass transitions , and that the theory is not able to detect that , in an exact treatement , the percolation threshold fixes an absolute limit to diffusive behavior .",
    "when fluid - fluid collisions come into play at finite fluid densities , this leaves room for the prediction of a reentry phenomenon in contradiction with percolation theory .",
    "we believe that it is for the same reason that the mct also misses the fact that , at any matrix density , there is always a non - vanishing probability that particles will be trapped in a finite domain disconnected from the rest of the void space , so that the exploration of the available void space is never completely ergodic @xcite .",
    "it is thus clear that the prediction of a reentrant behavior of the ergodicity breaking transition line in the low fluid density domain should not be taken too literally .",
    "in fact , a reasonable expectation based on this finding is that , below the localization threshold , but in the regime where transient trapping effects are important , there might be an acceleration of the dynamics due to fluid - fluid collisions .",
    "interestingly , such a behavior has already been observed in a computer simulation study of a two dimensional lattice gas model with fixed randomly placed scatterers @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was found that , starting from the zero fluid density limit , the diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle first increases with the fluid density .",
    "an interpretation in terms of a decorrelation process similar to the one discussed in sec .",
    "iv was then proposed and validated by varying the parameters of the model .    as a possible source of the difficulties of the theory",
    ", one might blame the fact that it works at the level of disorder averaged quantities .",
    "indeed , the procedure of averaging over disorder is equivalent to an averaging over the volume of a macroscopic system , an operation in which many microscopic details of the statics and dynamics become blurred .",
    "this might confer a mean - field character to the theory , where the contribution of the matrix would actually be taken into account at the level of a diffuse effective localizing potential , with a possible loss of important local constraints .",
    "unfortunately , this is a necessary step in order to develop a theory which is comparable in complexity with the one for bulk systems , since it allows one to consider the system as homogeneous .",
    "some progress has recently been made on the application of the mct to inhomogeneous situations @xcite , so it should be possible to relax the condition of homogeneity in order to study the dynamics of fluids confined in pores of simple geometry which are often preferred in simulation works , but there is no doubt that the more complex wavevector dependence of the resulting theory will make it harder to obtain numerical solutions of the equations .",
    "moreover , beyond this purely technical aspect , the present formulation in terms of disorder averaged quantities has a practical interest as well .",
    "indeed , many real porous media are disordered and most experimental techniques measure quantities which are averaged over the volume of a macroscopic sample and thus equivalent to the disorder averages considered by the mct .",
    "so , the current theoretical setup seems well suited for direct comparisons with experimental results . for molecular dynamics simulations , however ,",
    "since rather small systems are usually considered , it might be necessary to explicitly perform the disorder average over a representative sample of matrix configurations before a comparison with the theory can be done .",
    "altogether , in spite of the above merely technical issues , we believe that the present mode - coupling theory represents a valuable step towards a better understanding of the slow dynamics of confined glassforming liquids .",
    "indeed , it remains rather simple and , since it is a microscopic approach , it allows one to study in detail the effect on the dynamics of changes in the different ingredients of a fluid - matrix model ( fluid - fluid and fluid - matrix interactions , structure of the matrix ) .",
    "thus , this provides us with a tool to efficiently and thoroughly explore the phenomenology of dynamics in confinement .",
    "this is clearly illustrated by our findings for two very simple systems with pure hard core interactions , which already display new and nontrivial glass transition scenarios . then remains the question of the validation of the theoretical predictions . because the model of the qa mixture is quite simple and the theory makes detailed predictions",

    "exactly the same calculation can be done with subsets of the above three quadratic variables .",
    "one then easily demonstrates that , if only @xmath233 and @xmath234 are considered , the same equations are obtained , while , if one works with @xmath233 and @xmath235 , the equations of ref .",
    "@xcite are reproduced , which reduce to those of refs .",
    "@xcite in the zero fluid density limit .",
    "a fruitful source of new theoretical developments on the physics of glassy systems has been the finding that the mct provides an exact description of the equilibrium dynamics of a certain class of mean - field spin - glass models with multispin interactions @xcite . in this appendix , based on ref .",
    "@xcite ( the interested reader is referred to this paper for details ) , we show that the equations describing the dynamics of such a mean - field spin - glass model in a random magnetic field reproduce the structure of those of the mct for a fluid in a random environment .",
    "thus , the correspondence between the two approaches still holds in the presence of an external source of disorder .",
    "we consider the fully connected mean - field spherical spin - glass model with three spin interactions in a random magnetic field , whose hamiltonian is @xmath236 = - \\sum_{1\\le i < j <",

    "( @xmath244 ) , this model is known to generate the quadratic memory kernel introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite as a one wavevector approximation to the bulk mct functional .",
    "thus , it is especially suitable for our purpose , since it displays nonlinearities of the same degree as in the mct .    in the presence of a random magnetic field ,",
    "just like qa mixtures are characterized by static frozen density fluctuations , the present spin - glass model is characterized by static frozen local magnetizations @xmath245 which vanish when the average over disorder ( both on couplings and fields ) is performed .",
    "accordingly , we might define @xmath246 and introduce three correlation functions , which are the analogues of @xmath48 , @xmath47 , and @xmath82 .",
    "they are , respectively , the two overlap functions @xmath247 and @xmath248 which obey @xmath249 , and the normalized connected spin correlation function , @xmath250    the exact solution of the langevin dynamics of the model using standard methods @xcite provides us with an equation for the time evolution of @xmath85 which reads , for a high enough temperature @xmath13 ,      a direct comparison of these equations with those of sec .",
    "ii immediately shows that both sets of equations exactly have the same formal structure . in particular , beyond the simple fact that the memory functions are similar polynomials of the dynamical correlation functions , the same parametrization in terms of connected and disconnected static correlations is found .",
    "we conclude with two short remarks .",
    "first , as for qa mixtures , we note that the external random field does not enter explicitly in the above equations ( no @xmath253 is present ) .",
    "because the model is exactly soluble , it is easy to understand how this happens .",
    "in fact , the details of the random field are only needed for the computation of the static correlations , through the equality @xmath254 once this calculation is done , they can be forgotten .",
    "the same is probably true for fluids in random environments and this supports the assumption that the mct equations for qa systems actually have a wider domain of applicability , provided they are expressed in terms of fluid quantities only .",
    "second , it can be shown that eq .   also describes the residual relaxation of the present spin - glass model in zero field , when the system is equilibrated in its low temperature phase and the total spin correlation function has a nonvanishing infinite time limit @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath255 and @xmath256 simply have to be replaced by @xmath7 and @xmath257 .",
    "thus , in the present model , the difference discussed in sec .",
    "iii between self - induced glassiness and the effect of a quenched random field does not seem to exist .",
    "this could have been anticipated , since by construction , fully connected models are unable to capture phenomena which only show up in the wavevector dependence of the coupling constants in fluid systems .",
