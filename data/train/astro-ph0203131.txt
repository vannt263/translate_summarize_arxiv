    "weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure has been shown to be a valuable method of measuring mass fluctuations in the universe ( see mellier at al .",
    "2001 for a review ) .",
    "this effect has been detected both from the ground ( wittman et al . 2000 ; van waerbeke et al . 2000 , 2001 ; bacon et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2002 ) and from space ( rhodes , refregier , & groth 2001 , rrgii ; hmmerle et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these results bode well for the prospect of measuring cosmological parameters and the mass distribution of the universe using weak lensing .    in this letter , we present the highest significance detection of cosmic shear using space - based images .",
    "it is based on images from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) medium deep survey ( mds ; ratnatunga et al .",
    "we apply the methods for the correction of systematic effects and detection of shear we have previously developed ( rhodes , refregier , and groth 2000 ; rrgi ) to 271 wfpc2 fields in the mds .",
    "the method of rrgi is specifically adapted to hst images and takes advantage of the small psf of the hst ( 0.1  as compared to @xmath40.8  from the ground ) .",
    "this affords us a higher surface density of resolved galaxies as well as a diminished sensitivity to psf smearing when compared to ground - based measurements .",
    "we develop an optimal depth - weighted average of selected mds fields to extract a weak lensing signal .",
    "we then use this signal to derive constraints on the amplitude of the mass power spectrum and compare this to measurements from previous cosmic shear surveys and from other methods .",
    "the mds consists of primary and parallel observations taken with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on hst .",
    "we selected only the i - band images in chips 2,3 , and 4 to study weak lensing . to ensure random lines - of - sight , we discarded fields which were pointed at galaxy clusters , leaving us with 468 i - band fields . to ensure that our fields are independent , we selected 291 fields separated by at least 10 , beyond which scale the lensing signal drops considerably ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "we used the mds object catalogs ( ratnatunga et al .",
    "1999 ) to determine the position , magnitude , and area of each object , as well as to separate galaxies from stars .",
    "we used the chip - specific backgrounds listed in the mds skysig files , which are consistent with backgrounds calculated using the iraf task imarith . not using object - specific backgrounds necessitated the discarding of another 20 fields with a large sky gradient .",
    "our final catalog thus consisted of 271 wfpc2 fields amounting to an area of about 0.36 deg@xmath5 .",
    "the procedure we used for measuring galaxy ellipticities and shear from the source images is described in detail in rrgi ( 1999 ) ( see also rrgii and rhodes 1999 ) .",
    "it is based on the method introduced by kaiser , squires , and broadhurst ( 1995 ) , but modified and tested for applications to hst images .",
    "the usefulness of our method was demonstrated by our detection of cosmic shear in the hst groth strip ( rrgii ) .",
    "we correct for camera distortion and convolution by the anisotropic psf using gaussian - weighted moments .",
    "camera distortions were corrected using a map derived from stellar astrometric shifts ( holtzman , et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "psf corrections were determined from hst observations of four stellar fields these fields were chosen to span the focus range of the hst as shown by biretta et al .",
    "finally , we derive the ellipticities @xmath6 of the galaxies and convert them into shear estimates using @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the shear susceptibility factor given by equation  ( 30 ) in rrgi .",
    "-0.3 cm [ fig : magdist ]    to limit the impact of noise and systematics , we made a number of cuts to select our galaxy sample .",
    "we first discarded objects for which @xmath9 after deconvolution . to avoid using galaxies with low signal - to - noise",
    ", we included only galaxies that have a magnitude @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the median magnitude ( before the cut ) of the field and chip in which the galaxy lies .",
    "this is consistent with the magnitude cut we made in rrgii .",
    "we also discarded small galaxies ( size @xmath12 pixels ) in order to minimize the effects of the anisotropic psf on our measurements ( see rrgi ) .",
    "the final galaxy sample contained about @xmath13 galaxies .",
    "the distribution of the median magnitude @xmath14 ( after the cuts ) of our fields is shown in figure  1 , which reveals a wide range of depth for the mds .",
    "for the magnitude range of the mds ( @xmath15 ) , we use spectroscopic redshift determinations from the deep survey ( deep collaboration , 1999 ) and the hubble deep fields ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1996 ) to determine that the median redshift @xmath16 in a field is related to the median magnitude @xmath17 by the equation @xmath18 this agrees well with an extrapolation of the cfrs redshift distribution ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) we used to determine the median redshift of objects in the groth strip ( rrgii ) .",
    "both methods give @xmath19 for the groth strip ( @xmath20 ) , where the error gives a measure of the @xmath3 systematic uncertainty in the above relation .",
    "we wish to derive a measure of the shear variance on different angular scales by averaging over the @xmath21 chips in each of the @xmath22 fields . as explained in  [ procedure ] , the fields have varying depths but are are sufficiently far apart to be statistically independent . as in rrgii",
    ", the total mean shear @xmath23 in chip @xmath24 and field @xmath25 can be measured by averaging over all the selected galaxies that it contains .",
    "it is equal to the sum of contributions from lensing , from noise and from systematics , and can thus be written as @xmath26 .",
    "the noise variance @xmath27 can be measured from the data by computing the error in the mean @xmath23 from the distribution of the galaxy shears inside the chip .",
    "as rrgi showed , the systematics are greatly reduced if the shear is averaged over the chip scale and if small galaxies ( with @xmath28 ) are discarded . in this case , the systematics are dominated by the time - variations of the psf and induce a shear variance @xmath29 ( see rrgii ) .    for each field @xmath25 ,",
    "an estimator for the shear variance @xmath30 on the chip scale is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and similarly for @xmath33 .",
    "assuming gaussian statistics , the error variance of the combined estimator is given by ( see bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 for the case @xmath34 ) @xmath35 & \\simeq & \\frac{1}{n_{c } } \\left [ \\sigma_{\\rm lens , f}^{2 } + \\sigma_{\\rm noise , f}^{2 } + \\sigma_{\\rm sys , f}^{2 } \\right]^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\    &   & + \\frac{2}{n_{c}^{2 } } \\sum_{c\\neq c ' } \\sigma_{\\times cc'f}^{2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the cross - correlation between chips @xmath24 and @xmath37 and can also be measured from the data .",
    "the term @xmath38 corresponds to cosmic variance , and the last term arises because the chips within a field are not statistically independent . while the lensing shear field is known to be non - gaussian on scales smaller than about 10 ( eg .",
    "jain & seljak 1997 ) , the non - gaussian corrections to this error estimate are small for noise - dominated 2-point statistics like the variance ( see discussion in rrgii and white & hu 2000 ) .    because the fields have a range of depths , it is desirable to combine the individual estimators @xmath39 using a weighting scheme of the form @xmath40 a convenient choice for the weights is given by @xmath41 i.e. to the inverse square of the noise contribution to the error in @xmath39 .",
    "this weighting scheme is nearly optimal , and avoids including the lensing signal @xmath42 itself .",
    "the average weights @xmath43 in several magnitude bins are shown in figure  1 .",
    "as expected , deeper fields have larger weights since they contain a larger number of galaxies and thus have a smaller value of @xmath44 .    to measure the shear variance on the field scale , we first average the shear within each field and apply the same procedure .",
    "this time , however , the cross - correlation term in equation  ( [ eq : sig2_sig2_lens ] ) vanishes since each field is independent .",
    "similarly , we can consider pairs of chips to measure the shear variance on intermediate scales .",
    "-0.3 cm [ fig : var_obs ]",
    "our measurement for the shear variance @xmath45 on different scales is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the angular scale @xmath46 is the radius of an effective circular cell whose mean pair separation equals that of the chip configuration considered ( @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , for 1 , 2 and 3 @xmath49 chips , respectively ) .",
    "the outer @xmath3 error bars include both statistical errors and cosmic variance ( from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : sig2_sig2_lens ] ] ) , while the inner error bars only include statistical errors ( i.e. by setting @xmath50 and @xmath51 to 0 on the right - hand side of this eq . ) .",
    "for instance , on the chip scale we obtain @xmath52 , yielding a detection significance ( inner error ) of @xmath53 with this scale alone . as a check of systematics",
    ", we analyzed our signal into @xmath54 and @xmath55-modes using the aperture mass @xmath56 statistic on the chip scale ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 ; van waerbeke et al . 2001 ) . for @xmath54-modes",
    ", we find the upper limit @xmath57 ( @xmath3 ) which is consistent with the signal expected in a @xmath2cdm model ( @xmath58 ; schneider et al .",
    "1998 ) . for the @xmath55-modes",
    ", we find @xmath59 ( @xmath3 ) , as expected in the absence of systematics ( which corresponds to @xmath60 ) .",
    "the measurements from other groups are also plotted in figure  2 , along with the predictions for a @xmath2cdm model with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the central value for @xmath63 is close to the recent measurement of this parameter from galaxy clustering ( eg .",
    "percival et al .",
    "2001 ) , while keeping the @xmath64 relation valid for @xmath65 .",
    "the predictions are plotted for a range of galaxy redshifts @xmath66 , corresponding approximately to the uncertainty and dispersion of this parameter in the different surveys . in our case , the effective median i",
    "- magnitude of our measurement is @xmath67 , which corresponds to a median redshift of @xmath68 ( see eq .  [ [ eq : red_mag ] ] ) .",
    "the effective magnitude and corresponding redshift are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "given the range of median redshifts in the different surveys and the correlation between angular bins for the variance , our results are in good agreement with these other measurements and with the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "our measurements can be used to constrain cosmological parameters . because our measurements on different scales are not independent",
    ", we conservatively only consider the shear variance on the chip scale ( @xmath69 ) . within a @xmath2cdm model",
    ", it is predicted to be ( see rrgii ) , within an excellent approximation , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the amplitude of mass fluctuations on 8 @xmath72mpc scales , and @xmath73 is the matter density parameter .",
    "inverting this equation , we find that our measurement of @xmath74 yields @xmath75 , where the first error is statistical only and the second also includes cosmic variance . to this error",
    "must be added that arising from the uncertainty in the median effective redshift @xmath76 . after propagating this error",
    ", we obtain @xmath77 where the first error reflects statistical errors only , and the latter is the total error and includes statistical errors , cosmic variance , and redshift uncertainty ( all @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows the comparison of our measurement of @xmath71 ( hst / wfc2 ) with that from other weak lensing surveys and from other methods . a @xmath2cdm model with @xmath78 and @xmath62",
    "was assumed ( except for van waerbeke et al .",
    "2001 who marginalized over @xmath63 ) .",
    "our @xmath71 value is consistent with the other recent cosmic shear measurements of bacon et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and also with the ` old ' normalization from cluster abundance ( eg .",
    "pierpaoli et al .",
    "this was recently revised to a lower normalization , by using the observed mass - temperature relation rather than that derived from numerical simulations ( eg .",
    "seljak 2001 ) .",
    "a similar normalization was derived by combining measurements of galaxy clustering from 2df and cmb anisotropy ( lahav et al .",
    "our results are consistent with this new normalization at the @xmath79 level .",
    "-0.3 cm [ fig : sigma8 ]",
    "we have achieved the highest significance detection of cosmic shear using space - based images to date . using the mds ,",
    "we have detected the shear variance on 0.7 to 1.4 scales with a significance greater than @xmath53 . from the amplitude of the signal we derived a normalization of the matter power spectrum given by equation  ( [ eq : sigma8 ] ) , with errors which include statistical errors , ( gaussian ) cosmic variance and the uncertainty in the galaxy redshift distribution .",
    "our results agree with previous measurements of the rms shear using both ground and space based images at the @xmath3 level and with the ` old ' ( eg .",
    "pierpaoli et al .",
    "2001 ) and ` new ' ( eg .",
    "seljak 2001 ) cluster abundance normalization at the @xmath80 and @xmath79 level , respectively .    a weighted average of the four recent cosmic shear measurements shown in figure  3 yields @xmath81 , for a @xmath2cdm model with @xmath78 and @xmath62 ( see vertical bars in figure  3 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the old cluster normalization at the @xmath82 level , but somewhat inconsistent with the new cluster normalization at the @xmath83 level , where the uncertainty is dominated by that from cluster abundance .",
    "this discrepancy could be caused by unknown systematics in the cluster abundance or cosmic shear methods .",
    "for the latter case , the calibration of the shear measurement methods would need to be revisited , in the context of current and upcoming surveys .",
    "the inaccuracy of the calculation of the non - linear power spectrum and of the halo mass function may also contribute to the error budget .",
    "if confirmed however , this discrepancy could have important consequences for our understanding of the physics of clusters , or may require extensions of the standard @xmath2cdm paradigm for structure formation .",
