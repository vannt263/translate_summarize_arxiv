    "the discovery of topological insulators(tis ) is one of the recent breakthroughs in condensed matter physics .",
    "they have been at the forefront of materials research due to their unique electronic properties and potential for wide range of applications . like band insulators , tis host a bulk band gap and do not conduct electricity in the bulk . however , on the surface they host robust symmetry protected massless metallic states that support spin - polarized conduction@xcite .",
    "these surface states result from the bulk electronic topology and associated band inversion due to strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the low energy dynamics of such massless surface states can be described with a dirac hamiltonian with spin locked to momentum h=@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is reduced plank s constant , @xmath4 is the fermi velocity , @xmath5 stands for pauli matrices and * k * is the wave vector .",
    "the topology of a time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry invariant insulator is characterized by @xmath6 indices which can be either be zero ( topologically trivial ) or one ( topologically non - trivial)@xcite . in 2-d , a single z@xmath0 invariant ( @xmath7 ) specifies the topology , where as in 3-d four z@xmath0 invariants are needed ( @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10)@xcite . in 3-d , a tr invariant topological insulator can further be classified as strong topological insulator ( sti)@xcite or weak topological insulator ( wti ) , based on whether a ti hosts odd or even number of dirac cones on its surfaces respectively . for an sti , @xmath7=1 and ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 ) can be 0 or 1 , whereas for a wti , @xmath7=0 and atleast one of ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 ) should be non - zero@xcite .",
    "while an sti exhibits topological surface states ( tss ) with odd number of dirac cones on any surface@xcite , a wti hosts tss with even number of dirac cones only at specific surface planes@xcite .",
    "a wti phase can be adiabatically connected to stacked layers of 2d strong tis@xcite , and its surface states are linked to the edge states of each 2d ti layer .",
    "translational - invariant coupling between these layers gaps out the surface states perpendicular to the layer directions@xcite , leaving the dirac cones to manifest only at their side surfaces@xcite . in this",
    "regard , tsss in sti are always manifested whereas they are either manifested or hidden in case of a wti @xcite .",
    "+ the surface states of wti were initially thought to be unstable towards non - magnetic disorder @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that wti surface states are robust against strong tr - invariant disorder@xcite , similar to those of stis .",
    "these states are further predicted to exhibit intriguing quantum phenomena such as one - dimensional helical modes along dislocation lines @xcite , weak - anti - localization ( wal ) effect@xcite , half quantum spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "additionally , wtis offer new possibilities to obtain 2d tis by exfoliating a single quantum spin hall ( qsh ) layer from the bulk which is technically more feasible than fabricating complicated quantum wells@xcite .",
    "however , the wti phase has been proved to be elusive experimentally .",
    "khgsb@xcite , bi@xmath0tei@xcite and a superlattice structure of pbte / snte@xcite are theoretically proposed to be wtis , but their experimental verifications is yet to be achieved .",
    "the bismuth - based layered compound bi@xmath11rh@xmath12i@xmath13@xcite is the only known experimental realization of a wti .",
    "the intuitive design of a wti material borrows from an idea that a stack of weakly coupled 2d topological insulators may lead to a 3d wti . for example",
    ", bi@xmath11rh@xmath12i@xmath13 is essentially a stacked graphene analogue@xcite , with each layer exhibiting a large spin orbit interaction at bismuth .",
    "another promising route is to stack alternating bismuth bilayers ( 2d topological insulator ) with a trivial insulator .",
    "bi@xmath0tei follows this paradigm and has been theoretically shown to be a wti , but with no experimental verification .",
    "primarily , the difficulty in fabrication of these materials in single crystalline bulk or thin film form has proven to be a significant hindrance to research in weak topological insulators .    in this letter , we present possibly the simplest realization of a weak topological insulator , borrowing essentially from two observations .",
    "first , bismuth bilayers are exemplary quantum spin hall insulators@xcite",
    ". therefore a stack of coupled bi@xmath0 bilayers should ideally give rise to a 3d wti .",
    "we intuit that stacking of bismuth bilayers sandwiched on either side by a topological insulator instead of a trivial insulator could also possibly host a wti .",
    "second , and more importantly , it is known that the bismuth chalcogenides exhibit what is known as ` infinitely adaptive superlattice ' phase @xcite .",
    "the stoichiometry of bi@xmath14se@xmath15 can be adjusted to a wide range of values by composing stacks of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0 with thickness of suitable ratio . for the simplest possible ratio with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , one obtains a crystal structure as shown in fig .",
    "1a wherein a repeating unit is formed by a bi@xmath0 bilayer sandwiched bwtween two bi@xmath0se@xmath1 layers .",
    "the hallmark of this structure is that it consists of quantum spin hall insulators@xcite that are coupled to each other through 3d topological insulators@xcite .    with combined experimental and theoretical studies ,",
    "we show that bise belongs to ( 0;001 ) class of @xmath6 weak tis , where the band inversion takes place at @xmath18 and @xmath19 points in the brillouin zone , which is contributed by both the bi@xmath0 layer and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 quintuple layers . to probe surface transport properties , we grow thin films of bise and study magnetotransport at low temperatures .",
    "magnetoresistance measurements indicate a pronounced weak - antilocalization cusp , consistent with a strong spin - orbit coupling in the system .",
    "electronic structure of bise , calculated within a non - relativistic approximation at the experimental lattice constant @xcite ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , reveals a metallic character with a flat conduction band along @xmath18-a line just above fermi level ( e@xmath20 ) , which is highly localized and confined to the bismuth bilayer ( see supplementary fig .",
    "dispersion of this band near the e@xmath21 ( along @xmath18-a ) is similar to that of an unconventional superconductor mgb@xmath0 @xcite and weak topological insulators like bi@xmath0tei @xcite and khgsb @xcite .",
    "this unoccupied conduction band is constituted primarily of @xmath5-bonded p@xmath14 and p@xmath15 orbitals of bi in the bismuth bilayer , and becomes dispersion - less due to weak interlayer interaction .",
    "such empty covalent bonds cost energy , and this flat band pushes bise to the brink of lattice instability ( with imaginary frequency of @xmath22 @xmath2315 @xmath24 appearing along @xmath18-a direction , the crystallographic direction of stacking in bise , see fig .",
    "orbital projected electronic structure reveals that the contributions to the valence band ( vb ) and conduction band ( cb ) around the fermi level are mainly from the bi bilayer and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 quintuple layers ( qls ) respectively , except along the @xmath18-a line where this is reversed , indicating the inverted band structure and existence of topologically nontrivial phase in bise . with inclusion of spin - orbit coupling in determination of electronic structure (",
    "2b ) , the doubly degenerate flat bands split opening up a gap along @xmath18-a , and elsewhere in the brillouin zone ( smallest indirect gap being 42 mev ) . as bise is centrosymmetric and invariant under time reversal , the topological z@xmath0 invariant of its electronic structure effectively determines its topological nature .",
    "we determine the four z@xmath0 invariants ( @xmath25 ) from the parity of occupied bands at eight time reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) following fu and kane s work @xcite .",
    "the strong topological index , @xmath7 , is calculated by taking the product of the parity of occupied bands ( @xmath26 ) at eight trim through the relation @xmath27 , where @xmath23 runs over eight trim , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the parity of the 2m@xmath30@xmath31 occupied band at i - th trim .",
    "the other three weak topological indices ( @xmath32 ) are determined using @xmath33 , where @xmath23 runs over the four trims ( see supplementary section iv for detailed analysis ) .",
    "the z@xmath0 invariants of bise are ( 0;001 ) , showing that it belongs to a class of weak topological insulators like khgsb @xcite and bi@xmath0tei @xcite .",
    "goverts et al.@xcite recently questioned the claim that bismuth bilayer terminated bi@xmath0se@xmath1 exhibits a single dirac cone in the electronic structure of ( 001 ) surface @xcite .",
    "they showed that the dirac - like cone in bi@xmath0 terminated surface actually corresponds to rashba split states of the bismuth bilayer which arises from the presence of an internal electric filed associated with polarity and charge transfer from bi@xmath0 to bi@xmath0se@xmath1 quintuple layers @xcite .",
    "our results for the electronic structure of ( 001 ) surfaces with different surface terminations and thicknesses of bise indeed agree with goverts et al.@xcite .",
    "thus , the composite system bise neither possesses the strong topological properties of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite nor of bi@xmath0 layers @xcite ( see supplementary section v ) . to further confirm the weak topological nature of bise , we determined surface electronic structure on ( 100 ) surface ( i.e. yz - plane of the unit cell , see supplementary section i and fig .",
    "s 3c , d ) of bise , which reveals two(even number of ) dirac cones at @xmath34 and @xmath35 points of the brillouin zone ( see fig . 2c ) .",
    "similar to the case of another weak ti , bi@xmath0tei @xcite , the two dirac points ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are not the projections of @xmath18 and a points of the bulk on the ( 100 ) plane of the reciprocal space in fig .",
    "angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements were carried out on a thin single crystalline flake of bise cleaved in situ under a base pressure of 1x10@xmath36 mbar . in the arpes spectrum of bise along the @xmath18-m direction of the surface brillouin zone ( see fig .",
    "3a ) , the high intensity signal around binding energy ( be ) e@xmath37=-0.25 ev corresponds to the bulk valence band ( bvb ) states , whereas the bulk conduction band ( bcb ) states are close to fermi energy e@xmath20 ( e@xmath38 ) .",
    "interestingly , we find two states in the region between the bcb and bvb showing inverted parabolic dispersion ( marked with green dots ) .",
    "these states are marked as surface state bands ( ssb ) , prototypical of rashba spin - split ( rss ) states .",
    "the apex of these rashba split ( rs ) states barely touches the e@xmath20 around k@xmath39=@xmath40 0.20 @xmath41 ( denoted as @xmath42 ) .",
    "crossing of these bands ( e@xmath43 ) occurs at e@xmath37 @xmath22 -0.18 ev at the @xmath18-point . in the vicinity of this point ,",
    "these bands exhibit nearly linear dispersion , like dirac cone states .",
    "however , e@xmath43 is not clearly visible due to mixing of this feature with the bvb states .",
    "the rashba parameter 2e@xmath44/k@xmath45 which has been calculated by using the estimated values of e@xmath44 and k@xmath45 from the arpes data ( see fig .",
    "3a ) is 1.8 ev@xmath46 . comparing these results with the relativistic band structure of bise ( see fig .",
    "2b ) along the ( 001 ) plane , it is clear that the calculated surface states , appearing along the @xmath18-m direction ( marked by red color box ) due to strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , are in fairly good agreement with the ssb observed in the arpes image . however , the energy position of the ssb in the calculated band structure is at a lower binding energy than that in the experimental arpes data .",
    "this difference in the energy position could be due to band bending @xcite and/or due to intrinsic doping from charged defects .    in order to understand the isotropic nature of the ssb , we measured the arpes spectra along two different orientation : @xmath22 @xmath47 ( @xmath18-@xmath48 ) and @xmath22 @xmath49 ( @xmath18-@xmath50 ) offset from the @xmath18-m direction . along the @xmath18-@xmath48 direction ,",
    "the second rs state is completely visible(see fig .",
    "3c ) , unlike the previous case ( see fig .",
    "3a ) . however , the separation between the two rs states is not well resolved and a dumbbell shape intensity distribution is observed around the @xmath18- point . in the other k - direction @xmath18-@xmath50 , maximum of the second parabolic band appears blurred and near the @xmath51 intensity distribution shows a pear shape structure around the @xmath18-point , as seen in fig .",
    "it is clear from these arpes images that there are two rashba spin split ssb states in bise which arise from the rashba splitting of states in the bi bilayer due to potential gradient generated from the charge transfer from bi bilayer to the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 quintuple layers .",
    "though , the rs states like ssb are not well resolved , these observations are close to our theoretical band - structure prediction of weak topologically insulating phase in bise .",
    "secondly , these observations are also consistent with a previous arpes study on a similar system i.e. bi films grown on bi@xmath52se@xmath12@xcite . on the other hand , these ssb are remarkably different from the ssb found in a typical strong topological insulator , for example bi@xmath52se@xmath12 , shown in fig .",
    "3e . in this case , the single dirac cone like feature is clearly visible in the vicinity of e@xmath21 near the @xmath18-point .",
    "this difference in the observed arpes intensity pattern between bise and strong ti , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 further confirms the topologically distinct character of the ssb in bise .",
    "the electronic structure of bise has its signatures in the low temperature magneto - transport properties ( see fig .",
    "4a ) . we find that its resistivity increases with temperature , marking a metallic behavior .",
    "the carrier concentration and mobility estimated from hall effect measurement are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively for a single crystal flake of thickness 0.22 mm .",
    "this carrier concentration can be attributed to selenium vacancy defects as corroborated by our arpes measurements , but a large bulk carrier concentration proves to be a major obstacle in sieving out transport properties of only the surface states . resistance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "4b ) produced non - saturating linear magnetoresistance .",
    "though , the origin of linear magnetoresistance is highly debated , we assume this might be due to the continously varrying fluctuations in the conductivity in the weak disorder limit@xcite ( discussed later )",
    ".    a large bulk conduction observed in single crystal flakes of thickness of the order of millimeters can be quantified with dimensional scaling of properties of films .",
    "hence , we grew thin crystalline films of bise using pulsed laser deposition(pld ) on sio@xmath0(500nm)/si(111 ) substrates .",
    "we used x - ray diffraction and atomic - force microscopy to characterize the crystallinity of our thin films and determine the surface morphology respectively ( see supplementary section i ) .",
    "electrical transport measurements were carried out on two bise films patterned into standard six probe hall bars of different thickness , both in the ultra - thin regime . in the zero - field resistivity @xmath55 data for 9 nm and 15 nm samples as a function of temperature ( see fig .",
    "5a ) , a sharp low - temperature resistivity upturn below @xmath2230k is indicative of an insulating ground state at low temperatures . at t=230k",
    ", we observe another transition from metallic to semiconducting state .",
    "this can be explained as follows : in the two channel model with a metallic surface in parallel with a semiconducting bulk@xcite , the net conductance of the sample is dominated by the more conducting channel . as a function of increasing temperature",
    ", the conductance of the metallic channel decreases linearly while that of the semiconducting bulk increases exponentially .",
    "one therefore expects a cross - over temperature above which conductance of the semiconducting bulk exceeds the conductance of the metallic surface states originating from the rashba - spin split bands , driving a high temperature transition to semiconducting behavior .",
    "this is what we observe for the 15 nm film .",
    "however , for the 9 nm film , where the bulk conduction is smaller , such a transition is expected to happen at a higher temperature , and we therefore do not observe it in our measurements till 300k .",
    "we observed linear hall resistance for both 15 nm and 9 nm samples .",
    "the linearity indicates that majority of charge cariers are of simillar type and mobility@xcite .",
    "the carrier concentrations of both the samples are of the same order with @xmath56 for 15 nm sample and @xmath57 for 9 nm sample .",
    "mobility of the samples is low : with @xmath58 .",
    "such low mobilites indicate strong scattering from static disorder present in the sample . assuming a spherical fermi surface@xcite , we estimated @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a dimensionless parameter that measures the strength of disorder , k@xmath61 is fermi wave vector and @xmath62 is the mean free path , to be 0.25 and 0.40 for 15 nm and 9 nm respectively ( @xmath60 @xmath63 1 , corresponds to weak disorder ) , which indicates that our films fall in the weak - disorder regime . in the limit of weak disorder , weak localization corrections to conductivity",
    "are expected to appear at low temperatures . by applying a small magnetic field , the weak localization correction to conductivity",
    "can be destroyed thereby forming a powerful tool to probe weakly disordered conductors .",
    "a wealth of information about electron dynamics including phase relaxation lifetimes , nature of disorder and symmetry classes of governing hamiltonians can be extracted from these measurements .    since , 3d topological insulators ( both stis and wtis ) belong to the symplectic class in altland - zirnbauer classification@xcite , they exhibit weak anti - localization , with correction to the drude conductivity arising from destructive interference of time - reversed paths . with application of magnetic field ,",
    "time reversed trajectories accumulate opposite phases , eventually leading to decoherence when the phase difference is of order @xmath64 .",
    "this magnetic field induces suppression of weak anti - localization corrections in two dimensional systems is quantified by the hln equation @xcite , @xmath65 $ ] , where e is charge of electron , @xmath66 is the phase coherence length , @xmath67 is wal co - efficient and @xmath68 is the digamma function .",
    "we measured magneto - resistance at different temperatures from 2k to 25k in a perpendicular b - field upto 7 t ( see fig .",
    "5b ) . at low temeperatures , in contrast to single crystal flake",
    ", a well - defined weak - anti - localization cusp is clearly seen in the low field region that graduates into a linear magnetoresistance regime for higher fields .",
    "fitting the hln equation upto 0.5 t , we find out the phase coherence @xmath69 ( 45 nm , 73 nm at 2k ) and @xmath67 ( 0.33 , 0.42 at 2k ) for 9 nm and 15 nm films respectively ( see fig .",
    "5b and 5d ) . from wal point of view",
    ", @xmath67 corresponds to the number of 2d coherent conduction channels present in the system .",
    "a coherent channel having a @xmath70-berry s phase should contribute a value of 0.5 to @xmath67 .",
    "we observed that the value of @xmath67 remains close to 0.5 ( 0.33 and 0.42 for 9 m and 15 nm respectively ) indiacting a single coherent conducting channel contributing to the conductance .",
    "the phase - coherence length increases moderately from 45 nm to 73 nm with thickness .",
    "it is interesting to note that parallel field yeilds significantly lower magnetoresistance compared to perpendicular field configuration simillar to stis ( see supplementary section ii ) , which needs to be understood further .",
    "the observed wal is a result of destructive intereference of electron paths due to @xmath70 berry s phase in topological insulators .",
    "the appearance of wal in our system indicates the presence of topologically protected surface states , also unlike topologically trvial systems it does nt exhibit any cross - over from wal to wl@xcite .",
    "spin orbit coupling of the rashba type leads to chiral fermions with spin locked perpendicular to the direction of momentum .",
    "such states contribute to quantum transport through weak anti - localization and have been observed in several other systems@xcite .",
    "functionalization and control of such states is highly desired , and has received tremendous recent attention as they form building blocks of next generation electronic technologies like majorana - fermion based quantum computing and spintronics .",
    "transport properties of wtis may offer exciting new opportunities in these directions , apart from forming a fertile ground for investigating new topological physics .",
    "weak topological insulators are relatively rare phases of topological matter . while a wealth of information about this phase is available from theoretical analysis , a thorough experimental verification and understanding",
    "have been lacking .",
    "we demonstrate that bise , belonging to the richly explored bismuth chalcogenide family , is a weak topological insulator . with first - principles calculations",
    ", we reveal that bise exhibits a pair of band inversions at @xmath18 and @xmath19 points in the 3d brillouin zone , and calculation of the four @xmath6 topological indices confirm the wti phase . strikingly , we find that bismuth bilayer terminated ( 001 ) surface reveals gap - less rashba spin split states .",
    "arpes measurements on single crystals cleaved in the ( 001 ) direction provide clear indications of surface states showing rashba spin splitting , and other features of the spectra match closely with the calculated electronic sturcture .",
    "to investigate the ` weakness ' of a wti , we perform electronic transport measurements on bise thin films that reveal signatures of weak anti - localization . thus , we provide a simple route towards fabrication of a wti amenable to exfoliations and point out the experimental signatures of this 3d topological phase , that will guide developement of other wti s .",
