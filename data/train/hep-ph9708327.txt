    "semileptonic @xmath11 decays are a rich laboratory in which to study the bound state structure of the @xmath11 meson . of particular importance",
    "are the nonperturbative parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath12 , which arise in the heavy quark expansion for the meson mass @xmath13 to relative order @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the heavy quark field , and @xmath6 is the @xmath18 quark pole mass . since these quantities also parameterize the inclusive semileptonic and radiative decay rates of the @xmath11 meson to order @xmath14@xcite , an accurate determination of them is essential for a reliable extraction of the ckm angle @xmath19 from inclusive semileptonic @xmath11 decays .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the expectation value of the leading operator which breaks heavy quark spin symmetry and therefore may be determined from the @xmath11@xmath20 mass difference , yielding @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath4 and @xmath5 can not be determined solely from mass measurements .",
    "there has been much recent interest in using inclusive observables other than the full semileptonic decay width to extract @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "an analysis of the decay based on the heavy quark expansion yields an expression for the doubly differential decay rate @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total momentum of the leptons and @xmath24 is the four - velocity of the @xmath11 meson .",
    "any observable which may be constructed from this doubly differential rate is sensitive to a linear combination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . actually , the simplest differential distribution to measure experimentally is the energy spectrum of the charged lepton , @xmath25 , which is somewhat more complicated because it depends on more than just @xmath23 .",
    "study of this distribution has already yielded useful constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .    in two previous publications",
    "@xcite , we suggested that moments of the hadronic invariant mass in semileptonic @xmath11 decay would also be interesting to study . if @xmath26 is the invariant mass of the hadrons produced in the semileptonic decay , and @xmath27 is the spin - averaged @xmath28 meson mass , then positive moments of @xmath29 vanish in the parton model at tree level .",
    "hence they are particularly sensitive to the power corrections proportional to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . however , it is difficult to measure these moments directly . until recently ,",
    "only fairly weak bounds on @xmath30 could be obtained , by combining information on various exclusive decay channels  @xcite . with the introduction of the technique of neutrino reconstruction , this situation is changing  @xcite .",
    "soon it will be possible to measure @xmath26 directly and inclusively , by reconstructing the neutrino momentum @xmath31 and using it to find @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the only complication is that this reconstruction requires a number of constraints on the phase space of the leptons , most importantly a lower cut on the charged lepton energy of about 1.5  gev  @xcite .    while one might consider extrapolating the data to lower @xmath34 and measuring the moments of @xmath26 that way , it is clearly preferable to update the computation of the moments of @xmath26 to include this lepton energy cut",
    "_ ab initio .",
    "_ it is the purpose of this note to present the results of such an analysis .",
    "there are few new theoretical issues which arise in this case , although the actual calculation is considerably more complicated than without the cut .",
    "we will refer the reader to our previous papers for a more complete exposition of the theory  @xcite , and only stress points where the new analysis differs in interesting ways from the old .",
    "we will also extend our earlier analyses by including the complete power corrections to the moments to @xmath35 .",
    "dimensional estimates of the size of these corrections will help us to estimate the error in the extraction of @xmath4 and @xmath5 due to @xmath10 effects .",
    "they will turn out to be under control for the first moment , but very large for the second moment , compromising its usefulness for obtaining constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis of the moments of @xmath26 begins with the doubly differential spectrum @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this distribution may be written as a product of a hadron tensor @xmath39 and a lepton tensor @xmath40 , @xmath41 each of these tensors has a decomposition in terms of scalar invariants , such as @xmath42 the @xmath43 are scalar functions of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here",
    "we neglect the masses of the leptons .",
    "if we impose a cut @xmath46 on the charged lepton energy , then the effect is simply to modify the components @xmath43 , @xmath47^{3/2}}\\bigg (    4(v\\cdot\\hat q)^3 - 3\\hat q^2v\\cdot\\hat q+4[(v\\cdot\\hat q)^2-\\hat q^2]^{3/2 }    + 6x\\hat q^2\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad    -12x(v\\cdot\\hat q)^2 + 12x^2v\\cdot\\hat q-8x^3\\bigg)\\,,\\nonumber\\\\    l_2&=&{\\hat q^4\\over8\\pi[(v\\cdot\\hat q)^2-\\hat q^2]^{5/2 } }    ( 2x - v\\cdot\\hat q)(\\hat q^2 - 4xv\\cdot\\hat q+4x^2)\\,,\\nonumber\\\\    l_3&=&{\\hat q^2\\over8\\pi[(v\\cdot\\hat q)^2-\\hat q^2]^{3/2 } }    ( \\hat q^2 - 4xv\\cdot\\hat q+4x^2)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cut may be removed by setting it equal to the minimum charged lepton energy , @xmath48^{1/2}$ ] , in which case @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "expressions for the analogous hadron tensor components @xmath51 may be found in refs .",
    "the hadron tensor is independent of the cut @xmath52 .",
    "since the hadron tensor @xmath39 is computed with operator product expansion techniques which assume parton - hadron duality , the calculation must be smeared by integration over at least one of @xmath44 or @xmath45 before meaningful observables may be extracted  @xcite .",
    "a nonzero cut @xmath52 has the effect of restricting the available phase space for the leptons , which controls the range of integration in @xmath44 and @xmath45 . if @xmath52 is too large , the integration is too restricted , and the operator product expansion breaks down.this is known to happen , for example , near the lepton endpoint in charmless semileptonic @xmath11 decays , for @xmath34 above about 2.2  gev  @xcite .",
    "however , our calculations of the coefficients of the @xmath10 corrections indicate that the lepton energy cut of 1.5  gev which is required for the neutrino reconstruction technique is not severe enough to cause such problems .",
    "the next step is to compute parton level moments of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the invariant mass and total energy of the strongly interacting partons produced in the semileptonic decay of the @xmath18 quark .",
    "the energy is computed in the @xmath18 rest frame .",
    "the partonic variables are related implicitly to the hadronic variable @xmath26 by @xmath56 since these expressions involve both @xmath13 and @xmath6 , they must be inverted order by order in the heavy quark expansion using eq .",
    "( [ massexpand ] ) .",
    "the final result will be moments of the form @xmath57 , for @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , we will see that only the first moment is really reliable , where the terms of order @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the heavy quark expansion are known .",
    "by contrast , the second moment starts only at order @xmath60 , and hence is extremely sensitive to the large number of unknown parameters which arise at order @xmath61 .",
    "while it is possible to calculate the radiative corrections by calculating the @xmath62 contributions to the @xmath51 s themselves , it is much simpler to calculate directly the leading corrections to the parton model rate .",
    "the only subtlety in the calculation arises in determining the boundaries of phase space when the electron cut is imposed . since the limits of integration of the electron energy depend on the parton level invariant mass @xmath63 and lepton invariant mass squared @xmath32 , for given values of @xmath63 and @xmath32 the electron cut may either lie below the lower limit of integration , in the region of integration , or above the upper limit of integration .",
    "let @xmath64 be any smooth weighting function .",
    "then the phase space integral is divided into kinematic regions , depending on the values of @xmath52 , @xmath63 and @xmath32 ,    * for @xmath65 , @xmath66\\nonumber\\\\&&+\\int_{(1 - 2x)^2}^{1 - 2x}\\ ,    ds_0\\,\\int_0^{2x(1-s_0 - 2x)\\over 1 - 2x}\\,dq^2\\,f(s_0,q^2){d \\gamma_1\\over d q^2    ds_0}\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * for @xmath67 , @xmath68    here @xmath69 is the differential rate calculated with the electron energy cut imposed , and @xmath70 is the differential rate calculated with no cut , corresponding to @xmath52 lying below the lower limit of integration for the electron energy . in the regions of phase space omitted from the expressions above ,",
    "the cut lies above the upper limit of integration for the electron energy .",
    "the  blm -enhanced \"  @xcite two - loop corrections are those which are proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath71 is the first term in the qcd beta function .",
    "these corrections dominate the two - loop corrections to many processes in qcd , and their effects in @xmath18 decays have been discussed extensively in the literature@xcite .",
    "they are straightforward to calculate numerically using the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite , and no new subtleties are introduced into the calculation when an electron energy cut is added . because of the renormalon ambiguity in its definition @xcite , @xmath4 is only defined order by order in perturbation theory . since we are including the @xmath9 terms in our extraction of @xmath4 ,",
    "the resulting value is the  two - loop \" @xmath4 , and should only be compared with other extractions of @xmath4 at the same order .",

    "the @xmath78 are related to nonlocal time ordered products of @xmath14 terms in the operator product expansion with @xmath79 terms in the lagrangian  @xcite , @xmath80 the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath78 are determined by nonperturbative qcd , and their values are not known ; however , we compute their coefficients to ensure that none of them are anomalously large . we will use dimensional analysis to estimate @xmath81 and @xmath78 , to obtain a rough estimate of the error in the extraction of @xmath4 and @xmath5 induced by @xmath10 effects .",
    "the coefficients @xmath82 are themselves functions of @xmath83 , although we will not compute radiative corrections to any of these coefficients . at present , @xmath84 are known to order @xmath83 only in the absence of an electron energy cut . while it would certainly be desirable to include terms of order @xmath85 for general @xmath2 , the calculation is quite difficult and we have not attempted it here .",
    "this omission is particularly important for the second moment , since @xmath86 . without the cut ,",
    "the term in question is numerically as large as the leading terms proportional to @xmath87 and @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "( in the case of the first moment , by contrast , the radiative correction to @xmath89 is only a few percent  @xcite . ) for this reason , as well as because of the large @xmath10 corrections , it is dangerous to use the second moment in a measurement of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we will include our ignorance of these terms in the estimate of the theoretical error in our results below .",
    "let @xmath90 be the scaled lepton energy cut .",
    "when @xmath91 , we reproduce the known results  @xcite , @xmath92 and @xmath93 the leading radiative correction to @xmath94 is @xmath95 , and to @xmath96 is @xmath97 . for the preferred experimental cut of 1.5  gev , for which @xmath98 , we find @xmath99 and @xmath100 we present plots of the coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath102 for arbitrary @xmath2 in figs .",

    "the effects of the @xmath10 corrections to the moments in the extraction of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ errorplot1 ] . for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we first assume perfect experimental measurements of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and then extract @xmath4 and @xmath5 using the theoretical expressions at order @xmath14 .",
    "we take @xmath105 .",
    "these values for the first and second moments restrict @xmath4 and @xmath5 to lie on the solid and dashed curves , respectively , meeting at the point @xmath106 .",
    "the hypothesized data have been chosen so that this intersection coincides with the central values obtained from an existing analysis of the lepton energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we then may estimate the theoretical uncertainty in our hypothetical result by following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite . by dimensional analysis ,",
    "the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath78 are all of order @xmath107 , and an estimate of their effect on the extraction of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is obtained by varying their magnitudes independently in the range @xmath108 .",
    "since the vacuum saturation approximation suggests that @xmath109 , we take it to be positive , and we eliminate @xmath74 by making use of the relation between @xmath74 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 and the @xmath112@xmath28 and @xmath20@xmath11 mass splittings presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "finally , we vary the unknown coefficient of the @xmath85 term for both moments between half and twice its value with the cut removed .",
    "varying the unknown parameters randomly in the allowed ranges , we find that the shaded ellipse shown in the figure and centered about the mean of the distribution contains 68% of the points .",
    "( because the @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 terms bias the determination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a known way , the distribution is not centered about the point extracted from the theory at order @xmath14 . ) .",
    "the region inside the ellipse gives a reasonable estimate of the theoretical error in the extraction of @xmath4 and @xmath5 due to higher order effects .",
    "note that , as expected , the constraints from the second moment are strongly affected by higher order corrections , whereas the constraints from the first moment are quite tightly distributed about the leading result .",
    "thus , as discussed earlier , only the linear combination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 given by the first moment is significantly constrained .",
    "constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 also have been obtained from moments of the lepton energy spectrum above 1.5  gev  @xcite . to compare the theoretical errors in this approach to ours ,",
    "we have performed an analysis analogous to that of the previous paragraph .",
    "this is similar to what was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we also include the terms proportional to @xmath9  @xcite . the result is shown in fig .  [ errorplot2 ] .",
    "the size of the ellipse from the lepton energy analysis is slightly larger than , but comparable to , that which we obtained from the hadronic mass moments .",
    "of course , the relative position of the ellipses is meaningless , since the hadronic mass moments have not yet been measured .",
    "unfortunately , the two experiments effectively constrain the same linear combination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , so that the measurements can not be combined to determine both parameters simultaneously .",
    "instead , an observable sensitive to a different linear combination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , such as the first moment in the photon spectrum in @xmath116  @xcite , will be required . in the meantime ,",
    "consistency of the various allowed regions in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane will provide a powerful test of the heavy quark expansion for these decays .",
    "we have presented a calculation of the first two hadronic invariant mass moments in semileptonic @xmath11 decay , in the presence of a moderate cut on the energy of the charged lepton .",
    "we included effects up to order @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these moments may be used to measure a linear combination of the hqet parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with a theoretical accuracy which is comparable to , or slightly better than , the accuracy obtained from an analysis of the charged lepton energy spectrum .",
    "the consistency of the results obtained from these approaches will provide a test of the heavy quark expansion as applied to semileptonic @xmath11 decays . to extract @xmath4 and @xmath5 simultaneously",
