    "soon after the discovery of the first millisecond pulsar ( @xcite ) , alpar et  al .",
    "( 1982 ) proposed that low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are the progenitors of millisecond pulsars .",
    "given the high incidence of lmxbs in globular clusters , searching for millisecond pulsars in clusters became a natural goal .",
    "after much effort , the first such object was discovered , an isolated pulsar with a period of 3ms in m28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "following searches of many clusters in the late 1980s and early 1990s , over 30 pulsars are now known in 13 clusters .",
    "in contrast to most pulsars in the galactic disk , the majority of cluster pulsars have short rotation periods and are often members of binary systems ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "searches for millisecond pulsars in globular clusters encounter two main difficulties .",
    "firstly , since globular clusters are on average more distant than the @xmath3kpc within which most large - area surveys have been sensitive to millisecond pulsars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , much longer observation times are typically required than for galactic searches .",
    "this in turn increases the complexity of the data - reduction task .",
    "such observation times are feasible only because of the small number of search targets .",
    "secondly , for binary pulsars there is the added difficulty that the apparent pulse period may change significantly as the pulsar experiences orbital accelerations during the longer integration .",
    "if this issue is not addressed at the data reduction stage  and with significant exceptions ( @xcite ) it rarely is , because of the massive computational requirements  many relatively bright binary pulsars may remain undetected .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "the rewards of a thorough search can be significant . because of the high probability of close stellar interactions , unusual binary systems not otherwise expected in the galactic disk may form in clusters .",
    "in addition , for clusters where several pulsars are found and studied with the detail allowed by high - precision timing measurements , much can be learned about the clusters themselves .",
    "applications to date include a determination of the core mass distribution from measurements of pulsar accelerations and positions , and limits on intra - cluster medium properties , by measuring the dispersion of various pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "47  tuc together with m15 have been by far the most prolific cluster targets for pulsar searches to date , with surveys revealing 11 and eight pulsars respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed population of pulsars in these two clusters is very different : while those in 47  tuc are all millisecond pulsars , the pulsars in m15 are more varied in their properties , including slowly - spinning pulsars and a rare double neutron - star binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that although all pulsars in m15 have had positions and period derivatives determined using pulsar timing techniques , this has been possible to date for only two of the pulsars in 47  tuc .",
    "this is due mainly to the different telescopes used and different interstellar scintillation characteristics : at arecibo , puerto rico , the majority of the distant pulsars in m15 , whose apparent fluxes vary little , are detectable on most days , while at parkes , australia , most pulsars in 47  tuc are visible only when the interstellar weather is propitious and the pulsar signals are amplified in the observing radio band by scintillation .",
    "unfortunately this has meant that many of the scientific objectives suggested by the wealth of pulsars known in 47  tuc remain unfulfilled .    in mid-1997",
    "a new , sensitive system for observing pulsars at a wavelength of 20 cm became available at the parkes telescope .",
    "pulsars are in general steep - spectrum sources ( @xcite ) , and all pulsars in 47  tuc were discovered at a wavelength of 50 or 70 cm ( manchester et  al .  1990 , 1991 ; @xcite ) . however , the new system provided such performance improvements that observations to study the known pulsars and to find previously undetected pulsars seemed desirable .",
    "these observations were so successful in the rate of detection of previously known pulsars and with discovery of new ones , that we have moved to observing the cluster almost exclusively with the new system . in this paper",
    "we report on the discovery of nine binary millisecond pulsars in 47  tuc and give improved parameters for some of the previously known pulsars .    in  [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe the observing system used , list the observations made , and outline the data reduction carried out . in  [ sec : sens ] we estimate the sensitivity of the survey for isolated and long orbital period pulsars , and compare it to that of past surveys of 47  tuc . in  [ sec : res ] we summarize the results , including parameters for the newly discovered pulsars and updated parameters for some previously known systems .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : disc ] , we discuss some limitations , and implications , of our survey and its results .",
    "since 1997 october we have been using the parkes telescope together with the pulsar multibeam data - acquisition system to observe the globular cluster 47  tuc at a central radio frequency of 1374mhz .",
    "the system consists of a cooled , dual linear polarization , 13-beam receiver package ( @xcite ) , and new filter banks , single - bit digitizer , and data - acquisition computer .",
    "each of the 13 beams has a half - power diameter of about @xmath14 on the sky . since a single beam encompasses the great majority of the cluster stars ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab:47tuc ] ) , we record data from the central beam only ( but see discussion in  [ sec : selection ] ) , while pointing the telescope at 47  tuc  c , the first pulsar discovered in this cluster .",
    "total - power signals from each of 96 contiguous frequency channels , each 3mhz wide , are one - bit sampled every 125@xmath15s and , together with relevant telescope information , are written to magnetic tape for off - line processing .",
    "data are usually collected on days when a pulsar survey of the galactic plane is also underway ( @xcite ) , and are recorded from 47  tuc for up to five hours daily .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] contains a log of all observations reported in this paper .",

    "this transformation is readily achieved by applying the doppler formula to relate a time interval in the pulsar frame , @xmath19 , to the corresponding interval in the observed frame , @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the observed radial velocity of the pulsar along the line - of - sight , @xmath23 is the speed of light , and we have neglected terms in @xmath24 of order higher than the first . ideally , if the orbital parameters of the binary system are known , @xmath22 can be calculated from kepler s laws . for the purposes of a blind search , where the orbital parameters are a priori unknown , assuming a keplerian model for @xmath22 would require a five - dimensional search of all the parameter space  a computationally non - trivial task ! the search can , however , be considerably simplified by assuming that the orbital acceleration @xmath25 is constant during the observation , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "this assumption is commonly used in searches of this kind ( @xcite ) and turns out to be reasonable over a wide range of orbital parameters , phases , and observation lengths .",
    "we investigate this in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : sensb ] .    given a prescription for @xmath22 , the re - sampling process is straightforward .",
    "the time intervals in the new frame are calculated from equation [ eq : resamp ] .",
    "new sample values are then created based on a linear interpolation running over the original time series ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we choose to define the value of @xmath27 such that @xmath19 is equal to the original sampling interval , @xmath28 , at the mid - point of the integration . for the condition @xmath26",
    ", it follows that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the integration time , 17.5min in our case .",
    "this condition guarantees that , under the approximations made here , the number of samples in the corrected time series is the same as in the original one .",
    "the re - sampling process is relatively trivial in terms of computation time and can be readily carried out for a number of trial accelerations for each de - dispersed time series in order to effect a search in `` acceleration space '' .    in all the analyses carried out in this paper , each de - dispersed time series was re - sampled and analyzed for a number of trial accelerations in the range @xmath31ms@xmath32 .",
    "most pulsars in presently known binary systems typically undergo accelerations of up to about 5ms@xmath32 .",
    "there are however other binary systems where more extreme accelerations have motivated us to search a larger range of acceleration space .",
    "these include the double neutron - star binary psr  b2127 + 11c in m15 , originally discovered at a trial acceleration of @xmath33ms@xmath32 ( @xcite ) , and the eclipsing binary psr  b1744@xmath3424a in terzan  5 ( @xcite ) , where the maximum line - of - sight acceleration is 33ms@xmath32 .",
    "the step size between each trial acceleration was 0.3ms@xmath32 .",
    "some care is required when choosing this interval in order to strike a compromise between unnecessary processing time incurred by oversampling the parameter space and the loss of sensitivity caused by undersampling .",
    "assuming that the constant acceleration approximation adequately describes the doppler shifts during the integration , it follows that the number of spectral bins across which a signal will drift due to the assumed trial acceleration being different from the true value by an amount @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the pulse period .",
    "our choice of step size thus guarantees that any pulsar period or harmonic with a period greater than 2ms will not drift by more than one spectral bin during the 17.5min integration .",
    "following the de - dispersing and re - sampling procedures outlined above , each time series is analyzed independently according to standard pulsar search techniques .",
    "the analysis procedure is very similar to that described in detail by manchester et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in brief",
    ", we compute discrete fourier transforms of each time series , and sum harmonically related spectral components for 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 harmonics in turn , in order to maintain sensitivity to a variety of pulse profile relative widths , or duty - cycles .",
    "for each harmonic sum , candidates are ranked in order of spectral signal - to - noise ratios ;  [ sec : sensb ] )  they are identical , and we use the nomenclature @xmath38 in both instances . to estimate average flux densities (  [ sec : flux ] ) , where some signal - to - noise ratios are large , we carry out all computations in the time domain . ] . at this stage , all spectral features with @xmath39 are stored , along with the period of the signal .",
    "once computations are completed for the time series corresponding to all trial accelerations for a 17.5min block of data , we plot @xmath38 versus trial acceleration for multiple occurrences of each period , within a suitable tolerance , detected above a pre - defined `` significance '' threshold .",
    "this threshold can be estimated theoretically from the statistics of the phase - space searched , but practical considerations ( such as the presence of radio - frequency interference ) result in our determining this value empirically .",
    "we generate plots such as that in figure  [ fig : snr ] for all cases where at least one detection of a multiply detected period has @xmath38 @xmath40 .",
    "to estimate the sensitivity of our search we calculate the minimum flux density @xmath41 that a pulsar must have in order to be detectable .",
    "following dewey et  al .",
    "( 1984 ) , this is given by @xmath42 here @xmath38 is the signal - to - noise ratio threshold of the survey ( 9 in our case ) ; @xmath43 is a constant that takes account of losses in sensitivity due to digitization of the incoming data and other inefficiencies in the system ( @xmath441.5 for our system ) ; @xmath45 is the system equivalent flux density ( @xmath4435jy for the present system in the direction of 47  tuc ) ; @xmath46 is the number of polarizations summed ( two in our case ) ; @xmath47 is the total observing bandwidth ( 288mhz ) ; @xmath30 is the integration time ( 1049s ) ; and @xmath48 and @xmath37 are the pulse width and period respectively .",
    "the observed pulse width @xmath48 in the above expression is in general greater than the intrinsic width @xmath49 emitted at the pulsar because of the dispersion and scattering of pulses by free electrons in the interstellar medium , and the post - detection integration performed in hardware .",
    "interstellar scattering is negligible for most observations toward 47  tuc , which is relatively nearby and located well away from the galactic plane .",
    "the observed pulse width for unaccelerated pulsars will therefore be the convolution of the intrinsic pulse width and broadening functions due to dispersion and integration , and can be estimated from the quadrature sum @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the dispersion broadening across one filter bank channel , @xmath52 is the overall pulse broadening due to the difference between the single dm at which we de - disperse all data and the true dm of a pulsar ( @xmath53 ) , and @xmath28 is the data sampling interval ( 125@xmath15s in our case ) .",
    "the dispersion broadening across a single channel is calculated using the standard expression @xmath54 which is valid for @xmath55 as in our case where @xmath56mhz and @xmath57mhz .",
    "the effective time resolution for these 47  tuc observations , calculated from equation  [ eq : dm ] and the sample time , at a dm of 25@xmath18pc , is approximately 0.3ms at the center frequency of observations , although it falls to 0.4ms at the low - frequency end .",
    "however in many cases the effective time resolution is limited by the @xmath58 term in equation  [ eq : weff ] , which amounts to @xmath59ms at 1374mhz .",
    "figure  [ fig : sens ] shows the search sensitivity as a function of period for a 17.5min integration based on equations [ eq : smin][eq : dm ] .",
    "here we have assumed a box - car pulse shape and an intrinsic duty - cycle of 15% , typical of many among the pulsars known in 47  tuc .",

    "a combination of these factors could explain why our more sensitive survey has failed to find additional isolated pulsars .",
    "the improved sensitivity of the acceleration search to short - period binaries is demonstrated by the fact that four of the nine binary systems we found , 47  tuc  p , r , s and v , would not have been discovered without the use of the acceleration code since , in each case , the signal - to - noise ratio never rose above the threshold of 9 at a trial acceleration of zero over the previously known population .",

    "[ fig : snr ] ) .    while it is clear that this survey has improved the knowledge of the true fraction of binary pulsars in 47  tuc , an outstanding question that remains is the extent of binary parameter space probed by the present search strategy . in this section",
    "we attempt to answer this by exploring the limits of the present search with respect to a variety of short orbital period binary systems . in what follows , when we use the term `` acceleration search '' we are explicitly referring to the one - dimensional ( i.e. , constant acceleration ) approximation outlined in  [ sec : data ] .    for the purposes of this discussion it is useful to note that most observed binary pulsar systems in 47  tuc fall broadly into two categories : those with orbital periods of order 0.42.3d and companion masses @xmath105 m@xmath106 ( 47  tuc  e , h , q , u , and probably s and t ) and 47  tuc  i , j , o , p , and r , which are characterized by shorter orbital periods ( 1.55.5h ) and lighter companions ( @xmath94m@xmath106 ) .",
    "( the nature of 47  tuc  v and w is unclear at present . )",
    "we shall refer to these types here respectively as the `` normal '' and `` short - period '' binary systems , investigating the sensitivity of our search to both types in turn .",
    "in addition , since all the presently known binary systems have essentially circular orbits , we also investigate the search sensitivity to putative binary systems in which the pulsar is in an eccentric orbit about a more massive companion .",
    "the first , and really only , detailed study of the degradation in sensitivity of a radio pulsar search for short orbital period systems was carried out by johnston & kulkarni ( 1991 ; hereafter jk ) . by calculating the decrease in amplitude of the signal in the fourier power spectrum for a binary pulsar relative to a solitary one , and mathematically describing the signal recovery technique involved in the acceleration search ,",
    "jk were able to quantify the degradation in sensitivity of pulsar search codes with and without acceleration schemes of the type used here .",
    "as their main example , jk considered a 1000s observation of a 1.4m@xmath106 pulsar in a circular orbit with a 0.3m@xmath106 companion for a wide variety of orbital and pulse periods . given that our 17.5min analyses correspond to a similar integration time , jk s results are highly relevant to this discussion .",
    "in addition , the 0.3m@xmath106 companion considered by jk closely resembles the class of normal binary systems defined above .",
    "we focus on figure  4 of jk , which shows the net gain in sensitivity of an acceleration search when making multiple observations of the same system . in their example",
    ", jk assumed five independent observations of the binary at random orbital phases . from this figure",
    "we see that , for a 10ms pulsar , the acceleration search allows one to detect binary systems with orbital periods of order four times shorter than a standard pulsar search code .",
    "the gain increases still further for shorter period pulsars , where the blurring of harmonics in the power spectrum becomes even more pronounced . for a 3.5ms pulsar , similar to 47  tuc  e and h , we infer from figure  4 of jk that the acceleration analysis allows the detection of a binary with an orbital period about six times shorter than the standard search",
    ".    the results of jk are not directly applicable to the population of short - period binaries in 47  tuc .",
    "presently , the 3.48ms pulsar 47  tuc r , with an orbital period of 96min , is the shortest orbital period system of this type . in order to estimate the sensitivity of our search code to even shorter period binaries with low - mass companions like 47  tuc  r",

    "one can also include the acceleration derivative term in the prescription for @xmath22 .",
    "although this necessarily adds a dimension to the search , it may provide a dramatic improvement in coverage of orbital parameter space for radio pulsars with binary characteristics akin to x1820@xmath34303 .",
    "finally , in table  [ tab : sim ] we also summarize the results of simulations carried out to test the efficiency of our code at detecting a putative relativistic binary double - neutron star system in a highly eccentric short - period orbit ( cases 5 and 6 ) . as would be expected , for certain orbital phases a normal search",
    "has no hope of detecting such systems , while the acceleration search maintains a detection efficiency of at least 20% at all orbital phases .",
    "our search would therefore have found a relatively bright relativistic binary pulsar in 47  tuc at any orbital phase , but none was detected .",
    "this provides some empirical evidence that the population of pulsars in the central regions of 47  tuc is composed exclusively of bona fide millisecond pulsars : those with rotation periods under @xmath114ms , and in relatively circular orbits with low - mass companions , or with no companions at all .",
    "an interesting issue from the point of view of the origin and evolution of the pulsars in 47  tuc is their intrinsic pulse period distribution .",
    "the observed distribution shown in figure  [ fig : phist ] spans a remarkably narrow range and suggests that there may be a deficit of pulsars below 2ms .",
    "this interpretation should be viewed with some caution , however , given the small number statistics , and it is clear from figure  [ fig : sens ] that we begin to lose sensitivity to pulsars with @xmath115ms . presently ,",
    "therefore , the observations do not unambiguously address the question of what the shortest pulsar periods might be . pulsar 47  tuc  w , for example ,",
    "was originally detected at a period of 1.18ms , showing that we are sensitive to some rather short periods , but to be truly sensitive to @xmath116ms , a different experiment with higher time and frequency resolution will have to be carried out .",
    "it is likely that the vast majority of all pulsars in 47  tuc are to be found within the area covered by the @xmath14-wide 20 cm telescope beam pattern .",
    "this is in keeping with expectations based on the radial density profile of 47  tuc ( @xcite ) from which we infer that almost 70% of the stars within the tidal radius of the cluster ( table  [ tab:47tuc ] ) fall within the telescope beam area .",
    "this is additionally suggested by the observation that the pulsars for which a timing solution has been obtained are all located within a region with linear size @xmath117 , and that we have re - detected all pulsars discovered at lower frequencies , even though the area subtended on the sky by the 20 cm beam pattern is at most one - sixth that within which the first 11 pulsars were found .",
    "nevertheless it is possible that some pulsars have been ejected from the central regions of the cluster , as is thought to be the case for m15 ( @xcite ) , and efforts to widen the search region might prove instructive .      for isolated pulsars , the sensitivity limits might be improved by a factor of up to @xmath118 by reducing the entire 4.66h data sets in a coherent manner .",
    "this could be done at reasonable computing expense because only the trivial zero - acceleration case would have to be addressed ( once the earth s rotation is accounted for ) . however , since flux densities for pulsars in 47  tuc certainly vary significantly due to scintillation on time - scales of hours or less , the gain in sensitivity might be quenched by periods within the 4.66h during which we would be adding mostly noise to the time series being analyzed . in extreme cases ,",
    "the sensitivity could actually be degraded !",
    "optimally then , each session s data stream should be analyzed with a multiplicity of integration spans .",
    "this can , however , degenerate into a huge overall data reduction task .",
    "these considerations also apply to the case of binary pulsars , where the additional need to perform sensitive acceleration searches over longer time intervals further exacerbates the overall computing load .    finally , as already noted , we have analyzed most of the data at only one value of dm .",
    "the dms for known pulsars in 47  tuc span about one unit ( table  [ tab : spin ] ) , and this already introduces some loss of signal for the shortest period pulsars we have considered (  [ sec : sens ] ) .",
    "it would also be advantageous to broaden the range of dm searches because greater variance in the value of measured dms might add to the understanding of the properties of the ionized intra - cluster , and interstellar , medium .",
    "most of the variance observed for dms of pulsars in globular clusters is expected to be due to slightly different lines - of - sight across the galaxy , because most clusters are believed to be evacuated of gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "mindful of the comments in the previous section , we can still make some general statements about the likely intrinsic population of pulsars in 47  tuc .",
    "the observed population of pulsars , all with millisecond periods , divides at present roughly into one - third isolated pulsars , one - third normal binary systems ( @xmath1192.3d and @xmath120m@xmath1 ) , and one - third short - period binary systems ( @xmath1210.2d and @xmath122m@xmath1 ) .    as mentioned previously , the fraction of isolated pulsars known in 47  tuc prior to this survey was 64% of the total .",
    "use of acceleration code has improved the detectability of binary systems , but we are still selecting severely against binaries of the short - period variety , when compared to isolated pulsars , and we consider it probable that the actual fraction of isolated pulsars in 47  tuc is less than the 35% found at present . by comparison ,",
    "the fraction of isolated millisecond pulsars in the disk of the galaxy is @xmath123 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the surveys of the galactic disk , because of their short integration times , are relatively more sensitive to short - period binaries , so the isolated fraction for disk pulsars , up to small - number statistics , is already known with some confidence .",
    "the overall small fraction of isolated millisecond pulsars in 47  tuc suggests an interesting puzzle : long - period binaries ( @xmath124@xmath125d ) are expected to be formed at high rates in dense clusters through exchange interactions between old isolated neutron stars and `` hard '' primordial binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the long - period binaries have , however , high cross - section to disruption , and should eventually leave behind isolated millisecond pulsars .",
    "we detect no long - period binaries , and relatively few isolated pulsars .",
    "perhaps most wide binaries are disrupted before the neutron star companions can evolve into red giants , followed by mass transfer and birth of millisecond pulsars , as in the standard scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is an open question . in any case , even if the isolated fraction of millisecond pulsars in 47  tuc and in the galactic disk are comparable it is surely a coincidence , given the different evolutionary pressures present in both environments .",
    "chen & ruderman  ( 1993 ) suggested that the formation mechanism for millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk and in globular clusters might be different . the observational evidence to support this idea relied on supposed differences in the observed radio beams ( and hence magnetic field geometry , and origin ) when comparing the collection of pulse profiles then available for disk millisecond pulsars and those in 47  tuc , and in particular the supposed dearth of interpulses among the pulsars in 47  tuc .",
    "more recently , jayawardhana & grindlay  ( 1996 ) also presented evidence suggesting that the observed pulse width distribution of disk and cluster millisecond pulsars may be different .",
    "our collection of profiles for pulsars in 47  tuc , shown in figure  [ fig : profs ] , is larger and of higher quality than that presented by manchester et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) , on which chen & ruderman  ( 1993 ) and jayawardhana & grindlay  ( 1996 ) based their conclusions .",
    "in addition , there are now many more high - quality pulse profiles available for disk millisecond pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "given these observational improvements , it is appropriate to briefly review the situation regarding possible morphological differences . in an attempt to ensure homogeneity",
    ", we choose to compare our 20 cm profiles with the sample of 19 galactic disk pulsars reported by kramer et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) which were also obtained from 20 cm observations .      in order to test the suggestion that the pulse widths of the pulsars in 47  tuc are broader than their counterparts in the galactic disk , we compared the pulse width distribution measured at the 50% intensity level ( @xmath126 ) for the 20 pulsars listed in table  [ tab : spin ] with that of the 19 disk millisecond pulsars presented in table 2 of kramer et  al .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnoff test returns a 25% probability that the two samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "at best this is a marginally significant result , reflecting the larger fraction of galactic disk millisecond pulsars for which @xmath127% ( but note that in spite of the improved time resolution of the new data , not all the profiles shown in figure  [ fig : profs ] are fully resolved ) .",
    "finally , from figure  [ fig : profs ] we note that 11 pulsars have essentially simple , single - component profiles ; five pulsars have clear interpulses ; and four more have profiles that may be described as complex , with emission evident across much of the period or in several distinct components . inspecting the sample of galactic disk millisecond pulsars presented by kramer et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we find five clear interpulses from a sample of 24 pulsars .",
    "given the present statistics , this is entirely consistent with the fraction of interpulses we observe in 47  tuc , refuting the morphological differences suggested by chen & ruderman  ( 1993 ) .",
    "robinson et  al .  ( 1995 ) show that , at 70 and 50 cm , 47  tuc  j is eclipsed by its companion for about a quarter of its orbit .",
    "we find that at 20 cm , on the other hand , the pulsar is always visible at all orbital phases . however 47  tuc  o , a pulsar system in many respects similar to 47  tuc  j , is always eclipsed for about 1015% of its orbit at 20 cm .",
    "there are three other similar systems known in 47  tuc , with orbital periods of less than 6h and with @xmath0m@xmath1 companions .",
    "47  tuc  p and r were detected at only one epoch , although at least one full orbit was covered in each case : 47  tuc  p was seen at all orbital phases , while 47  tuc  r was apparently eclipsed for @xmath128 of its orbit , centered with the pulsar at superior conjunction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] ) .",
    "47  tuc  i is detected much more often , and there are no eclipses observed at 20 cm .",
    "finally , 47  tuc  v also displays apparent eclipses , but we can not yet characterize the system or its eclipses , which may be irregular (  [ sec : resnew ] ) ; and 47  tuc  w , with @xmath129m@xmath1 , was eclipsed for @xmath130 of its orbit on the only occasion it was detected ( fig .  [ fig : vel ] ) . while based on orbital parameters we suggest that the system may be somewhat similar to the eclipsing pulsar b1744@xmath3424a in terzan  5 (  [ sec : resnew ] ) , we can not yet be sure .    in the galactic disk",
    "there are two pulsar systems known that have properties broadly similar to some of the above eclipsing pulsars .",
    "psrs  b1957 + 20 and j2051@xmath340827 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are millisecond pulsars in very circular orbits with @xmath0m@xmath1 companions , with orbital periods of a few hours .",
    "these pulsars are both eclipsed by their companions , apparently bloated to fill their roche lobes , but the systems differ in eclipse phenomenology : psr  b1957 + 20 always displays eclipses for @xmath123 of its orbit , at all frequencies , while psr  j2051@xmath340827 is eclipsed at low radio frequencies , but is visible at all orbital phases at 20 cm ; in the latter instance , however , the radio pulses suffer extra time delays as they propagate in a dispersive medium . the differences observed in these systems are likely due to a combination of different masses and chemical compositions of the companions , and possibly evolutionary states ; the energy that is deposited at the companion by the relativistic pulsar wind , which in turn depends on the pulsar spin parameters , beaming geometry , and orbital separation ; and geometrical effects .",
    "it is not yet clear if the eclipse behavior for 47  tuc  j or o , let alone that for the seldom - detected pulsars in 47  tuc , is similar to that of either psr  j2051@xmath340827 or b1957 + 20 .      in table",
    "[ tab:3sol ] we list phase - connected timing solutions for three pulsars . an unusual feature of all the solutions is that the period derivatives , @xmath72 , are negative , apparently implying the pulsars are spinning up , rather than spinning down as is the case for all pulsars known in the galactic disk , which are losing rotational energy emitted in the form of magnetic dipole radiation and a relativistic particle wind .",
    "in fact this is a feature observed in some other globular cluster pulsars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and is most easily interpreted by considering that the observed @xmath131 is a combination of the intrinsic @xmath132 and a contribution resulting from the acceleration of the pulsar in the gravitational potential of the cluster , such that @xmath133 in this equation , @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the acceleration along the line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "a negative @xmath136 implies the pulsar lies behind the cluster center as seen from the sun .",
    "given a model for the mass distribution in the cluster , a lower limit on @xmath135 by assuming @xmath137 , and an accurate pulsar position , one can estimate a lower limit to the central mass density in the cluster .",
    "assuming that the central regions of the cluster can be described by king s ( 1962 ) empirical density model , one obtains for the central central mass density @xmath138 in this expression @xmath139 is the projected distance of the pulsar from the cluster center and @xmath140 is the jeans length at the cluster center .",
    "for a king model , we have made the standard approximation that @xmath140 is one third of the core radius of the cluster , @xmath141 .",

    "( 1995 ) for the same pulsar .",
    "this is due to our use of the latest core radius estimate ( @xcite ) which is approximately half the value of previous estimates ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "de marchi et  al . demonstrate that the difference in core radius estimates can be entirely attributed to the effects of photometric incompleteness in the earlier samples .    if a king model can be used to describe the central regions of the cluster , and the observations of de marchi et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest that this is the case , the above are hard limits on @xmath8 , due to the assumption so far that @xmath137 .",
    "in fact @xmath145 is likely to have some finite positive value , such that we have thus far underestimated the accelerations felt by the pulsars .",
    "we now present some plausibility arguments that lead in general to more realistic estimates of a limit on @xmath8 .",
    "most millisecond pulsars known in the galactic disk ( @xmath146ms ) have inferred intrinsic surface dipole magnetic field strengths of @xmath147@xmath148 g , with an average of @xmath149 g ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a given @xmath37 and @xmath150 ,",
    "the period derivative is obtained ( e.g. , @xcite ) from @xmath151    we have no a priori information about the magnetic field strengths of the pulsars in 47  tuc , but if they were significantly higher than those for disk pulsars , so would the respective @xmath72 . for a putative 6ms pulsar , like 47  tuc  c , but with @xmath152 g , we obtain @xmath153 from equation  [ eq : b ] . in turn ,",
    "when used with equation  [ eq : rho2 ] , this would imply @xmath154m@xmath1pc@xmath155 , an unreasonably large value !",
    "a similar argument can be made for 47  tuc  j. if the magnetic fields of the millisecond pulsars in 47  tuc are not likely to be much larger than those of millisecond pulsars in the disk , we may assume that they are , on average , comparable .    following the above arguments , we calculate from equation  [ eq : b ] the likely values of @xmath156 for 47  tuc  c and j : @xmath157 and @xmath158 respectively , for @xmath159 g .",
    "these expected values can be decreased or increased by a factor of ten , considering the entire range @xmath160 g . to be conservative ,",
    "we consider only @xmath161 g . for 47  tuc  c , the full contribution due to acceleration in the cluster ( from eq .",

    "these contributions are increased over the hard limits assuming @xmath137 by factors of 1.01.3 for 47  tuc  c and 1.56.1 for 47  tuc  j. finally , the implied lower limits on @xmath8 are increased to 34@xmath163m@xmath1pc@xmath155 and 210@xmath163m@xmath1pc@xmath155 , for 47  tuc  c and j respectively .",
    "we conclude from the present timing solutions that @xmath164m@xmath1pc@xmath155 .",
    "this lower limit can be compared to `` standard estimations '' of @xmath8 , based on optical measurements of king model parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the aforementioned revision in the core radius value for 47  tuc implies that the existing estimate for @xmath8 , which scales as @xmath165 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , should be revised appropriately . scaling the value for @xmath8 tabulated by webbink ( 1985 ) ,",
    "we find @xmath166m@xmath10 .",
    "while this is in agreement with our present lower limits , it is unlikely that both 47  tuc  c and j have the lowest magnetic field strengths of any known pulsars and so , in the context of a king model , the above discussion is strongly suggestive that for 47  tuc , @xmath167m@xmath1pc@xmath155 , and possibly is as much as a factor of two or so larger .",
    "except for 47  tuc  c , d , and j , pulsars in 47  tuc are detected on fewer than 75% of observing days , and we have detected some of the pulsars on only one of 75 observing days ( see tables  [ tab : obs ] and [ tab : rare ] ) .",
    "given this fact , it is not appropriate to estimate average flux densities for most pulsars by simply averaging the detected signal - to - noise ratios and converting to flux densities using the approximately known system noise and detection apparatus characteristics . in this section we present a more rigorous method to estimate mean flux densities of the pulsars in 47  tuc .    the variability in apparent flux densities , apart from the occurrence of",
    "eclipses , results from interstellar scintillation ( @xcite ) , and we proceed further by assuming that scintillation affects all pulsars in 47  tuc similarly , since they are all located in relatively close proximity .    given this assumption , we construct cumulative histograms in @xmath168 for the frequently - detected pulsars in the cluster , and attempt to synthesize a `` standard '' histogram which we take to be representative of the relative flux variations due to interstellar scintillation for a pulsar in 47  tuc . initially the standard histogram is defined to be that of 47  tuc  j , the brightest pulsar .",
    "the histograms of other frequently - appearing pulsars are then shifted by a scaling factor in a fitting procedure so as to match the standard as closely as possible , in a least - squares sense .",
    "a new standard is then defined where @xmath38 of the @xmath169 strongest `` observation '' is the average of the respective values from each of the individually shifted histograms , and this procedure is iterated until the scaling factors are stationary and a self - consistent solution is obtained . the scaling factors with respect to the final standard ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shist ] ) therefore provide an estimate of the average relative signal - to - noise ratios of the various pulsars .      for 47  tuc",
    "j we obtain the actual average @xmath38 from the observations ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) , but correct it downwards to take into account the @xmath170 of observing days in which we do not detect the pulsar .",
    "we do this by assuming that on these days , on average , the pulsar has a flux density that is half of the lowest value detected , resulting in a 10% correction . after applying the scaling factors and converting to a flux density scale using the methodology outlined in  [ sec : sens ] , we obtain the average flux densities listed in table  [ tab : spin ] for 14 pulsars .",
    "one obvious problem with this method is that for the less - frequently appearing pulsars only part of the cumulative histogram is being fitted to  and to the extent that the standard histogram is in fact not precisely descriptive of the scintillation behavior of all pulsars , this may particularly skew the average @xmath38 for such pulsars . we have accounted for this in the uncertainties listed in table  [ tab : spin ] .",
    "in addition , until we calibrate the sensitivity of the observing system with a pulsed source of known strength , the conversion between @xmath38 and flux density is subject to a systematic uncertainty that we judge to be of the order of @xmath128 .    pulsars 47  tuc  c , d , and j , for which we have the most reliable flux density estimates , display maximum `` daily '' flux densities that are factors of 48 greater than the average values .",
    "this is the only information we have available that is of some use to estimate , very roughly , the average flux density for the pulsars that are detected very infrequently ( table  [ tab : rare ] ) .",
    "we obtain estimates of @xmath171mjy for the average flux density of these pulsars .",
    "we note this plausible estimate simply to suggest that the flux densities of these pulsars need not be much lower than those of the weakest among the more frequently - appearing pulsars .",
    "the weakest pulsars we have been able to detect in 47  tuc have flux densities at 1400mhz of about @xmath172mjy , while the strongest , 47  tuc  j , has @xmath173mjy . at the distance of 47  tuc ( table  [ tab:47tuc ] ) , these correspond to luminosities at 1400mhz , @xmath174 , of 0.811mjykpc@xmath175 . translated to luminosities at frequencies @xmath176mhz , assuming a spectral index for the pulsars in 47  tuc of @xmath177 , these correspond roughly to @xmath178mjykpc@xmath175 .",
    "the limiting minimum luminosity for galactic disk pulsars at @xmath179mhz is about 1mjykpc@xmath175 or lower ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the galactic disk ( @xcite ) and m15 ( @xcite ) , the differential luminosity distribution for pulsars",
    "is found to be consistent with @xmath180 . assuming that these findings apply to 47  tuc",

    "hence we estimate a potentially observable population of pulsars in 47  tuc , similar to the ones already detected , of about 200 , above a minimum luminosity @xmath181mjykpc@xmath175 . when beaming and selection effects are accounted for we judge it likely that 47  tuc contains several hundred pulsars with @xmath182mjykpc@xmath175 .",

    "<S> we have used a new observing system on the parkes radio telescope to carry out a series of pulsar observations of the globular cluster 47  tucanae at 20-cm wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> we detected all 11 previously known pulsars , and have discovered nine others , all of which are millisecond pulsars in binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we have searched the data for relatively short orbital period systems , and found one pulsar with an orbital period of 96min , the shortest of any known radio pulsar .    </S>",
    "<S> the increased rate of detections with the new system resulted in improved estimates of the flux density of the previously known pulsars , determination of the orbital parameters of one of them , and a coherent timing solution for another one . </S>",
    "<S> five of the pulsars now known in 47  tucanae have orbital periods of a few hours and implied companion masses of only @xmath0m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> two of these are eclipsed at some orbital phases , while three are seen at all phases at 20 cm but not always at lower frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> four and possibly six of the other binary systems have longer orbital periods and companion masses @xmath2m@xmath1 , with at least two of them having relatively large orbital eccentricities . </S>",
    "<S> all 20 pulsars have rotation periods in the range 28ms . </S>"
