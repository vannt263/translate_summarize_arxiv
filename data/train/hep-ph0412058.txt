    "soon after the first explicit formulations of supersymmetric ( susy ) versions of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite , enforcing r - parity conservation to prevent sources of violation of baryon and lepton number at tree - level , it was realized , as an interesting by - product , that these theories could naturally embed a candidate for cold dark matter  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it had been shown long before that weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) have a thermal relic abundance that is generically at a level relevant for cosmology , and the stable lsp falls under this category if it happens to be electric and color neutral ( and as it is indeed the case in large portions of the susy parameter space ) .",
    "two decades later , no susy particle has unfortunately been found at particle accelerators and no clean indication of susy has emerged from tests of rare processes or precision measurements . the initial theoretical motivations for susy , although still very appealing , are being questioned , with the scale of physics beyond the sm that is slowly , but steadily , drifting above the weak scale . on the other hand , in these twenty years , the case for non - baryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) being the building block of the universe has become stronger and stronger , with the determination of the cdm contribution to the universe energy density which has already reached a 20% level of accuracy  @xcite and is going to improve further in the upcoming years .",
    "it is then not surprising that in formulating an extension to the sm , sometimes , the issue of incorporating a dark matter candidate has changed from being a by - product of the proposed scenario into being one of the hinges of the theory itself .",
    "this is the case for a recently proposed susy framework , dubbed `` split supersymmetry ''  @xcite .",
    "split supersymmetry indicates a generic realization of the susy extension to the sm where fermionic superpartners feature a low mass spectrum ( say at the tev scale or lower ) , while scalar superpartners are heavy , with a mass scale which can in principle range from hundreds of tev up to the gut or the planck scale @xcite . in split susy one",
    "gives up on the idea that susy is the tool to stabilize the weak scale , since some other mechanism should anyway account for other fine tuning issues , such as that of the cosmological constant . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of phenomenological problems appearing in ordinary susy setups , where the whole spectrum of superpartners is supposed to be light , are cured : the heavy sfermions minimize flavor and cp violating effects , alleviate proton decay and avoid an excessively light higgs boson . at the same time , two major features are maintained : the successful unification of gauge couplings , and  the central issue in our analysis ",
    "the lsp as a viable particle candidate for cdm . finally , it is certainly a well - motivated scenario , as it has been shown that the occurrence of a split susy spectrum is indeed a generic feature of a wide class of theories @xcite .",
    "it arises , among others , in frameworks where the mechanism of susy breaking preserves a r - symmetry and forbids gaugino and higgsino mass terms , or in case of direct susy breaking through renormalizable interactions with the susy breaking sector ( direct mediation ) @xcite .    rather than focusing on some specific realizations ,",
    "we consider here a generic split susy setup : we refer to the minimal susy extension to the standard model ( mssm ) , set the scalar sector at a heavy scale , but allow for the most general fermion sector .",
    "we investigate how cosmological constraints affect the definition of such framework and discuss its testability by examining the issue of dark matter detection within this wide class of models , comparing also with the perspectives to test this scenario at accelerators . as a result ,",
    "we work out here a fully general analysis of neutralino dark matter on the basis of the lightest neutralino mass and composition , largely independent of the split supersymmetry framework ; in this respect , we outline a reference guide to the sensitivity of upcoming detection experiments which applies , especially as fas as indirect detection is concerned , to supersymmetric models with a generic ( moderatly ) heavy scalar sector .",
    "once the lsp composition and mass is known , our results allow to get a fair estimate of the detection prospects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : paramspace ] we describe our working framework and discuss the current constraints to its parameter space . in section",
    "[ sec : rates ] we introduce the relevant dark matter detection techniques and show rates in extremal regimes of the parameter space . in section",
    "[ sec : casestudy ] we discuss in detail the phenomenology of the split susy setup along a sample slice in the parameter space , show constraints from current data and address detectability in future searches , cross - checking the outreach of the different techniques . in section  [ sec : discussion ] we indicate how to generalize the results of the previous section to the full parameter space . finally , we draw an outlook and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a mssm setup , with the relevant parameters defined at at the low energy scale and without implementing any unification scheme .",
    "we restrain to the split susy framework by assuming that the sfermion sector is much heavier than the fermion sector and hence is completely decoupled ; as for the higgs sector , we assume there is only one light sm - like higgs , with a mass labeled by the parameter @xmath5 , while the other two neutral higgs and the charged higgs are taken again to be very heavy , and hence decoupled .",
    "finally , we will leave out of most of our discussion the gluino and the gravitino , supposing they are ( moderately ) heavy , just mentioning what are possible consequences in case this is not true .    in this scheme , the lightest neutralino , defined as the lightest mass eigenstate from the superposition of the two neutral gaugino and the two neutral higgsino fields",
    ", @xmath6 is automatically the lsp .",
    "the coefficients @xmath7 , obtained by diagonalizing the neutralino mass matrix , are mainly a function of the bino and the wino mass parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and of the higgs superfield parameter @xmath10 , while depending rather weakly on @xmath11 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral components of the su(2 ) higgs doublets .",
    "the hierarchy between @xmath9 and @xmath10 determines also whether the lightest chargino is wino like or higgsino like , and again the role @xmath11 is minor .",
    "the phenomenology of the scheme we are considering is hence fully defined by only five parameters : @xmath12    in this construction , constraints from accelerator data are rather weak , essentially just in connection with the fact that charginos have not been observed so far : we implement , as a conservative limit on the lightest chargino mass , the kinematic limit from the last phase of lep2 , _ i.e. _ @xmath13103.5  gev @xcite ( notice however that in large portions of our parameter space the lightest neutralino and lightest chargino are nearly degenerate in mass , and this limit should be slightly relaxed ; however , this does not critically enter in our discussion ) .",
    "+     +    much more powerful are constraints on the model from cosmology ; to implement the cosmological bounds , we refer to the determination of the cdm component of the universe by wmap  @xcite : @xmath14 .",
    "lsp relic densities are computed with the darksusy  package  @xcite , which allows for high accuracy solutions of the equations describing thermal decoupling .",
    "we study the parameter space varying freely the mass parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( no gut relations are assumed between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; we restrict to positive @xmath10 , since in this contest the case of negative @xmath10 is just specular ) , and taking the sample value @xmath15 and @xmath16  gev ( close to the current lower limit on the mass of a sm - like higgs ) .    in fig .",
    "[ m1m2 ] we consider slices , in the parameter space , along the planes @xmath17 ( left - hand - side panel ) and @xmath18 ( right - hand - side panel ) and for large values of the third mass parameter ( which we set to 10  tev ) . in the first case , since @xmath8 and @xmath9 are both diagonal entries in the neutralino mass matrix , the transition of the lsp from being bino like ( above the diagonal in the figure ) to being wino like ( below it ) is very sharp .",
    "the two regimes are very different because winos annihilate very efficiently into gauge bosons , while binos can annihilate just into fermions .",
    "the latter annihilation processes are very sharply suppressed , as compared to ordinary susy setups , since diagrams with @xmath19- and @xmath20-channel sfermions exchanges do not contribute here . in general , the relic density of the lsp scales with the inverse of the annihilation rate : it is very large for binos regardless of the lsp mass , while it tends to be too small for winos , unless one considers @xmath9 in the 2  tev range .",
    "the exception is in a narrow strip above the diagonal where the bino lsp is nearly degenerate in mass with the next - to - lightest wino like neutralino and chargino states , and the thermal equilibrium of the lsp in the early universe is enforced through these slightly heavier particles rather than by just lsp pair annihilations into sm particles : this is a very well - studied effect , usually dubbed `` coannihilation ''  @xcite , but that has been very seldom considered in this specific realization , since usually @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not taken as independent parameters .",
    "the region in the plane where the lsp relic abundance is too large is shaded . starting from light lsps",
    "( the mass of the lsp is essentially the minimum between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) in the bottom - left corner , the border of the excluded region approaches the diagonal , since increasing the mass scale the cross sections decreases , and hence coannihilation effects have to become larger and larger , _ i.e. _ mass splitting with coannihilating particles smaller and smaller .",
    "we reach then the mass value at which this process is saturated , and the lsp turns into wino like ; above this scale , even for winos , the annihilation cross section becomes too small and cdm is overproduced . in the figure , since we are plotting results on logarithmic scales , the iso - level curve at @xmath21 is essentially overlapping with the border of the excluded region , while in the remaining part of the plane , cdm is underproduced . in fig .",
    "[ m1m2 ] and [ 3dlabels ] we shade in red the regions with an excessively light chargino .    for the right - hand - side panel of fig .",
    "[ m1m2 ] , the picture is analogous .",
    "the wino mass parameter is assumed to be heavy , hence we are left with the possibility that the lsp is either bino like or higgsino like , depending on the relative values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "being the parameter @xmath10 in off - diagonal entries in the neutralino mass matrix , the transition between the two regimes is smoother than in the previous case , but the trend is the same , with higgsinos annihilating efficiently into gauge bosons and binos with suppressed annihilation rates .",
    "in the computation of the relic density both the effects of mixing and coannihilations enter , and , for instance , a wiggle in the borderline of the excluded region corresponding to the @xmath22 threshold is clearly visible .",
    "this is the scenario which has been considered up to now for estimates of the lsp relic abundance in split susy contexts  @xcite .",
    "the value of the higgsino parameter , hence of the higgsino mass , saturating the relic density constraint is smaller than for winos .",
    "this is illustrated also in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ 3dlabels ] , where iso - level curves for @xmath23 are shown in the plane @xmath24 and for a few values of @xmath8 . in case @xmath8 is very heavy , we see the transition of the lsp from being a pure wino ( upper part of the figure ) to being a pure higgsino ( right - hand side ) .",
    "the size of the saturating parameters differs because the coupling in the most important vertex , namely @xmath25 , reads @xmath26 for higgsinos and @xmath27 for winos , but also because the number of degrees of freedom in the coannihilation process in the two cases is different : as far as higgsinos are concerned , the coannihilating particles are two neutralinos and one chargino , all nearly degenerate in mass , while for winos only one neutralino and one chargino enter ( and this matters , because pair annihilation rates of charginos are larger than those for neutralinos ) .",
    "we find that a pure higgsino of mass equal to @xmath28  gev and a pure wino of mass @xmath29  gev have a relic abundance equal to @xmath21 , the current best fit value from the wmap data .",
    "lower values of @xmath8 imply smaller upper limits on the neutralino mass , corresponding , as sketched before , to bino lsps coannihilating either with winos or higgsinos , with the transition regimes getting progressively wider as @xmath8 decreases .",
    "a 3-d representation of the hypersurface at @xmath30 in the @xmath31 space is given in the right - panel of fig .",
    "[ 3dlabels ] ; the allowed low relic density region stands _ behind _ the plotted surface .",
    "the value of @xmath11 and @xmath5 have not played much of a role in our discussion , since we expect very minor changes in the cosmologically allowed portion of the parameter space if these are varied ( and we have indeed verified numerically that this is the case ) .",
    "such choice of parameters is actually crucial only for direct detection rates , as we will stress below .",
    "finally , the bounds we have derived are valid under the assumption of a standard cosmological setup , and including only thermal sources of dark matter .",
    "the bounds get tighter , or , from another perspectives , models that give here subdominant cdm candidates may become fully consistent with observations , if one introduces particle physics models with non - thermal sources of cdm , such as neutralino productions from gravitinos or moduli decays  @xcite , or considers cosmological scenarios with faster expansion rates at the time of decoupling : sample cases are cosmologies with a quintessence energy density term dominating at the lsp freeze - out temperature  @xcite , anisotropic universes with effective shear density terms  @xcite or in scalar - tensor theories @xcite . relaxing",
    "the upper bound is also possible , though maybe slightly more contrived , as it would involve wiping out ( totally , or in part ) the thermal relic component with an entropy injection : a mechanism of reheating at low temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ lower than the lsp freeze - out temperature which is in the range",
    "@xmath32  @xmath33 , would give this effect  @xcite .",
    "however , excluding this latter possibility , it is interesting to notice that , in this generic split susy setup , the cosmological bound is indeed the only issue forcing one of the sectors of the theory to be light , _",
    "i.e. _ at a scale lower than 2.2  tev .",
    "+    the issue of wimp dark matter detection has been studied at length ( for a review , see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite ; see also the more recent works , e.g. refs .",
    "we will show here that this is especially relevant in the split susy scenario by systematically discussing all wimp detection techniques that currently provide , or that will provide in the future , constraints on the model .",
    "rates are computed with the darksusy  package  @xcite ; the set of underlining assumptions will be briefly described here . in this section",
    "we will present sample rates for dark matter candidates in the three extreme regimes described above , and focusing on models with thermal relic densities in the wmap preferred range @xcite , in case of a standard cosmological setup . in the next two sections ,",
    "these results will be generalized , including also low relic density models , either by relaxing the requirement of thermal production of the whole cdm content of the universe or by referring to non - standard cosmological scenarios ; at that stage we will also put more emphasis on the comparison between different detection techniques .    in the last decade",
    "there has been a considerable experimental effort to detect wimps directly , measuring the recoil energy from wimps elastic scattering on nuclei  @xcite .",
    "our theoretical predictions are derived with the usual effective lagrangian approach , except that no contributions mediated by squarks are present , and taking a standard set of parameters  @xcite for nucleonic matrix elements ( note , e.g. , the strange content here is slightly smaller than the values implemented in other analyses , see  @xcite for details ) . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ curr_dirdet ] we plot the spin - independent ( si ) neutralino - proton scattering cross section @xmath34 , as a function of the neutralino mass .",

    "since the si scattering cross section is mediated by the light higgs in a t - channel , and the @xmath35 vertex scales with the higgsino - gaugino mixing , whenever this is small the cross section is small as well , as it can be clearly seen in the figure .",
    "the gray - shaded region corresponds to the projection of all points lying onto the hypersurface at @xmath36 in the @xmath31 space ( the hypersurface plotted in fig .  [",
    "3dlabels ] , right ) . not surprisingly , this region is close to being the zone delimited by the curves labeling the three extreme regimes just described ( and the same holds for all other detection techniques we discuss in the present section , hence , for the sake of clarity , we omit the corresponding shadings ) .",
    "the black dotted line indicates the current bound on @xmath34 from the cdms collaboration @xcite , while the green dot - dashed line stands for the projected sensitivity of next - generation ( sometimes dubbed _ stage 3 _ ) detectors ; for definiteness , we take as a benchmark experimental setup the xenon facility @xcite .",

    "the color coding on the @xmath37 isolevel curves is the same as in the left panel , making it transparent that the emerging pattern is perfectly specular . the neutrino flux in the sun scales with a capture rate which is dominated by the spin dependent ( sd ) neutralino - proton coupling , and , as for the si term",

    "the figure shows that going from the regime  @xmath42 to the regime @xmath43 , there is not only a sharp switch in the gaugino content , but also a step - like fall in the ( already small ) higgsino fraction . as we show , a slight dependence on @xmath11 ( which enters in the neutralino mass matrix ) is present .",
    "we will further discuss this effect in the next section .",
    "other indirect detection techniques rely on the fact that there is a finite probability for dark matter wimps to annihilate in pairs in galactic halos , and in particular in the halo of the milky way , possibly giving rise to exotic sources of radiation and cosmic rays . in this analysis",
    "we will consider the production of gamma - rays , antiprotons , positrons and antideuterons within our own galaxy .",
    "the yield per annihilation in all these channels is read out of simulations with the @xcite 6.154 monte carlo code as included in the darksusypackage , except for @xmath44 , where we use the prescription suggested in ref .",
    "since the source strength scales with the number density of neutralino pairs locally in space , i.e. , in terms of the dark matter density profile , with @xmath45 , the predictions for these signals are very sensitive to which @xmath46 is considered for the milky way . in fact , the latter is unfortunately not well - known , and one is forced to make some assumptions .    in this analysis , we will mainly focus on two extreme models for the milky way dark matter halo .",
    "they are both inspired to the current picture emerging from n - body simulations of hierarchical clustering in @xmath47cdm cosmologies , respecting , e.g. , the relation between halo mass and concentration parameter suggested therein .",
    "the two models diverge however in the way the effect of the baryon infall in the dark matter potential well is sketched .",
    "one extreme it to suppose that this process happened with a large transfer of angular momentum between the baryons and the dark matter . in this case the system of cold particles , sitting at the center of dark matter halo and forming the cusp seen in the simulations ( which describe the evolution of the collision - less dark halo component only ) , are significantly heated and removed from the central part of the halo .",
    "one such extreme scenario was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , suggesting that the resulting dark halo profile can be modeled by the so - called burkert profile  @xcite : @xmath48 this profile has been shown to provide fair fits in case of a large sample of the rotation curves for spiral galaxies  @xcite , and , from our perspective , having a very large core radius ( the parameter @xmath49 ) , is very conservative .",

    "the baryon infall happened as a slow and smooth process which gradually drove the potential well at the center of the galaxy to become deeper and deeper , accreting more and more dark matter particles in this central region .",

    "note also , even in this case , the sharp drop of the signal for pure binos , which is now due to the fact that they can annihilate just into fermions and with very suppressed rates ( of course coannihilation effects make a compensation in the effective thermally averaged annihilation cross section setting the relic abundance in the early universe , but not in the zero temperature cross section for annihilation for lightest state pairs , which is the relevant quantity here ) . at higher energies",

    "<S> we study the phenomenology of neutralino dark matter within generic supersymmetric scenarios where the gaugino and higgsino masses are much lighter than the scalar soft breaking masses ( split supersymmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a low - energy model - independent approach and show that the guidelines in the definition of this general framework come from cosmology , which forces the lightest neutralino to have a mass smaller than 2.2  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the testability of the framework is addressed by discussing all viable dark matter detection techniques . </S>",
    "<S> current data on cosmic rays antimatter , gamma - rays and on the abundance of primordial @xmath0li already set significant constraints on the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> complementarity among future direct detection experiments , indirect searches for antimatter and with neutrino telescopes , and tests of the theory at future accelerators , such as the lhc and a nlc , is highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study in detail the regimes of wino - higgsino mixing and bino - wino transition , which have been most often neglected in the past . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that our analysis may apply to more general supersymmetric models where scalar exchanges do not provide the dominant contribution to annihilation rates .    </S>",
