    "they are supersonic non - topological collective excitations . in spite of their relative simplicity ,",
    "the solitons clarify many features of molecular chains @xcite .",
    "for example , due to their robust character , lattice solitons have been used to model the energy transport in polypeptide chains in muscle proteins @xcite or the energy transport in dna @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations at realistic temperatures for transport in proteins have shown that lattice solitons can propagate over long distances in a chain with the lennard - jones potential @xcite . moreover , the lattice solitons are more stable than davydov solitons if collisions between the two types of solitons are considered @xcite .",
    "there is no clear evidence that lattice solitons like a toda type , which are non - topological , can exist in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this holds both for static properties , like the specific heat , and for dynamics quantities , like the dynamic form factor ( fourier transform of the displacement autocorrelation ) @xcite . on the other hand",

    "these solitons in some cases can be described by korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) type solitons , which are non - topological .    to our knowledge",

    "there are many studies on stochastic partial differential equations , in particular stochastic kdv - type equations have been extensively studied numerically and analytically @xcite due to the integrability of the kdv equation .",
    "in fact , the kdv equation is a good approximation to describe analytically the dynamics of lattice solitons on a monatomic chain with nearest - neighbor interaction and cubic anharmonicity if the soliton velocity is very close to the sound velocity ( very - low - energy solitons ) @xcite .",
    "notice that for a polynomial potential , namely harmonic term plus cubic or / and quartic anharmonicity , the one - soliton solution of the kdv equation is known analytically , while for more realistic interaction potentials like lennard - jones or morse there are no exact soliton solutions . in the more general context of lattice systems , there are a few analytical studies about diffusion of coherent lattice excitations , viz .",

    "a similar langevin - type equations has previously been considered in the context of mesoscopic langevin dynamics @xcite .",
    "we notice that our system in the continuum limit can be approximated by a noisy kdv - burgers - type equation @xcite .",
    "so in this case we can use the one - soliton solution of the kdv equation not only as initial condition of our discrete system but also in our analytical approach in the continuum limit .",

    "@xcite , a pulse lattice soliton in the presence of damping develops a tail .",
    "the amplitude of this trailing tail depends on both soliton the velocity and the damping , so it is bigger when the damping and/or the soliton velocity is higher .",

    "however , we have taken only the parameter @xmath101 as an estimate of the soliton velocity and with this value we have used a different method to determine the soliton position .",

[ algoritm ] and [ algoritm1 ] ) . however , we consider the latter method to be more appropriate than the former one in the sense that we proceed in our code in a similar way as in our analytical calculations .",
    "our langevin dynamics simulations were performed for a chain with 1500 lattice points .",
    "the time integration was carried out by using the heun method @xcite , which has been successfully used in the numerical solution of partial differential equations and difference - differential equations , coupled to either an additive or a multiplicative noise term @xcite . here",

    "all values of the constants of the equation ( [ simul1 ] ) are set at unity except the damping constant which is set at @xmath122 .",
    "notice that for lower values of damping the relaxation of the system energy would take more time in our simulations to reach a regime close to its stationary value .",

    "in fact , the time evolution of the velocity given by the simulation is always higher than the theoretical prediction .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we observe that @xmath153 where the soliton width @xmath154 is defined in ( [ restframe2 ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ deviat1 ] ) means that the stochastic deviations of the soliton center from its mean value are relatively small compared with the soliton width .",
    "so the diffusive dynamics of the soliton position evolves inside the soliton core .",
    "thus , this dynamics is very sensitive to the fluctuations of the soliton shape .",
    "notice that our method of determining the soliton position depends implicitly on the soliton shape .",
    "so in the case of low - energy solitons , where the shape is strongly masked by the noise , the uncertainties of the method of soliton detection are relatively large compared with the diffusive dynamics of the soliton position .",
    "this is because the diffusive dynamics is relative small with respect to the soliton width . in this respect",
    "we note that higher - energy solitons present a well defined shape , i.e. the thermal fluctuations are small respect to the soliton amplitude , so the variance of the soliton position , given by our detection method , indeed agrees better with our theory .",
    "( see [ fig3]c and [ fig4]c ) .",
    "finally , we stress that in our tests the phonon contribution to the soliton diffusion could be clearly observed only for very low - energy solitons ( figs .",

    "then , the value of the temperature of the thermal bath can be obtained by multiplying the values of @xmath168 by the reduced temperature .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath27-helix case the reduced temperature @xmath169 ( see caption fig . [ fig4 ] ) corresponds to @xmath170 of the thermal bath if @xmath171 or @xmath172 if @xmath173 .",
    "we have studied the non - equilibrium diffusion dynamics of lattice solitons on a classical chain of atoms under thermal fluctuations , namely soliton dynamics when the system energy is close to its stationary value .",
    "the interaction potential between the atoms is harmonic plus a cubic anharmonicity .",
    "the chain is coupled to a thermal bath at a given temperature .",
    "for that reason we have included dissipation and noise in the discrete equations of motion of the chain . here , it is assumed that the energy dissipation is provided by the irreversible processes arising from the finite velocity of the relative displacements between particles in the chain .",
    "thus the dissipative term takes the form of a hydrodynamical damping which is extensively used in elasticity theory . the noise term which fulfills",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem then becomes a discrete gradient of white noise delta - correlated in space and time . in the continuum approach our original discrete set of equations leads to a form of noisy kdv - burgers equation . at this point",
    "we have used a collective coordinate approach to study the diffusion dynamics of both position and velocity of the soliton . the soliton position and the inverse soliton width",
    "have been found to be good collective coordinates to describe the soliton diffusion .",
    "we have derived two stochastic ordinary differential equations with multiplicative noise which have been solved analytically using stochastic perturbation analysis .    for low - energy solitons ,",
    "whose velocities are close to the sound velocity , our molecular dynamics simulation has confirmed our analytical predictions .",
    "namely , normal diffusion of lattice solitons governs short times , while superdiffusive behavior is present for long times .",
    "the time range of the normal diffusion depends on the initial velocity of the soliton : it is large for velocities close to the sound velocity and short for high velocities .",
    "the collective coordinate approach does not take into account the noise - induced phonon bath , however we have shown that this does not play an important role except when the reduced temperature ( temperature in units of the initial soliton energy @xmath141 ) of the thermal bath is high . in that regime",
    "the soliton diffusion is normal . in this case , for a given temperature , we have estimated in our simulations the value of the diffusion constant due to the noise - induced phonon bath when the system energy is close to its stationary value .",
    "we have subtracted this value from the full value of the diffusion constant which is not only due to the induced phonons but also due to the noise .",
    "the order of magnitude of the resultant value of this subtraction is predicted by the collective coordinate approach .",
    "since we do not observe in our numerical results any dependence on the size of the system , we may expect similar results for very large systems , i.e. for @xmath174 .",
    "we provided an example by using an approximation of the lennard - jones potential to determine the temperature of the thermal bath in the cases of @xmath27-helical proteins and crystal inertial gases .    finally , our results above point out the robustness of lattice solitons .",
    "in fact , they can exist even for higher values of temperature and damping constant than those explicitly considered in the present article . on the other hand , for lower values of the temperature the variances of the soliton position and velocity turn out to be very small because they scale with the temperature .",
