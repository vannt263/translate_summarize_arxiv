    "in standard non - relativistic quantum mechanics time enters as a parameter , external to the quantum system being investigated , and as such is not a dynamical variable associated in any way with the system s dynamics . however , there are many cases , such as experiments measuring the time of arrival of particles at a detector , the decay time of an unstable quantum system etc . , which call for a more dynamical point of view with respect to time .",
    "one approach to this problem consists of the construction of time operators through the use of covariant positive operator valued measures ( povms ) @xcite .",
    "since the time operators built via the use of povms are in general maximally symmetric , non - self - adjoint operators , the construction of these objects bypasses an old theorem of pauli @xcite , stating that there does not exist a self - adjoint time operator @xmath3 canonically conjugate to a hamiltonian @xmath4 whose spectrum is semibounded , such that the pair @xmath3 and @xmath4 forms together an imprimitivity system @xcite .",
    "however , in comparison to standard self - adjoint quantum observables these operators present some difficulties , e.g. , in the relation between the algebra they generate and their spectral representations .    the dynamical role of time within the framework of standard quantum mechanics",
    "has recently been considered in @xcite through the construction of a family of self - adjoint lyapunov operators . throughout this text",
    "we define a lyapunov operator as a self - adjoint operator whose expectation value is monotonically decreasing in time .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath5 be a hilbert space corresponding to a given quantum mechanical system , let @xmath4 be a self - adjoint hamiltonian generating its evolution , and let @xmath6 be the state of the system at time @xmath7 . define the trajectory @xmath8 , corresponding to an initial state @xmath9 , as the set of states @xmath10 then the definition of a lyapunov operator is as follows @xcite : +   + * definition 1 : * _ _ let @xmath11 be a bounded self - adjoint operator on @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a trajectory corresponding to an arbitrarily chosen initial state @xmath12 .",
    "denote by @xmath13 the collection of all expectation values of @xmath11 for normalized states in @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath11 is a forward lyapunov operator if the mapping @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 is monotonically decreasing in time.__@xmath16 +   + * remark 1 : * if in the definition above we require that @xmath17 be monotonically increasing instead of monotonically decreasing we also obtain a valid definition of a lyapunov operator .",
    "the requirement that @xmath17 is monotonically decreasing is made purely for the sake of convenience .",
    "it follows from this definition that a lyapunov operator allows for the temporal ordering of states in any trajectory @xmath8 according to the ordering of the expectation values in @xmath18 , thereby introducing temporal ordering into the hilbert space @xmath5 of any problem for which such an operator can be constructed .",
    "the construction of lyapunov operators constitutes a somewhat conservative approach to the problem of time in quantum mechanics . in general , lyapunov operators indicate the direction of flow of time in a system but do not serve as time operators and are not intended for answering questions of direct time measurements .",
    "rather , the construction of lyapunov operators , and in particular the family of lyapunov operators introduced in @xcite , was carried out with a different goal in mind .",
    "the temporal ordering introduced into the hilbert space is a fundamental property of a quantum mechanical problem admitting lyapunov operators .",
    "a question then arises as to the possible implications this property may have on the description of the dynamics of the system , i.e. is there a way to ` inject ' the direction of time ordering introduced by the lyapunov operator into the description of the dynamics of a quantum system in such a way that certain processes in the evolution of the system obtain simple descriptions amenable to thorough analyses ?",
    "the study of such consequences of the existence of a lyapunov operator has been addressed to some extent in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we continue this line of investigation , and demonstrate the beginning of an affirmative answer to the question raised above .",
    "specifically , we show that the existence of the family of lyapunov operators introduced in @xcite leads to a certain description of the scattering process , which we shall term _ the transition decomposition _ , that is particularly useful for treating the evolution of scattering resonances .",
    "in this section we state some key results from @xcite , which will provide the basis for the all that follows . the following theorem is an adaptation of results stated in @xcite : +   + * theorem 1 : * [ thm : forward_lypunov_op]_let @xmath5 be the hilbert space representing some quantum mechanical system , let @xmath4 be its hamiltonian , and let the spectrum of @xmath4 be @xmath19 , absolutely continuous , and uniformly degenerate . then for any choice of generalized eigenbasis @xmath20 of @xmath4 , @xmath21 being the degeneracy index , the operator @xmath22 where the summation over @xmath21 may also stand for integration , is a lyapunov operator in the sense of definition 1 , and , moreover , for any state @xmath23 @xmath24 _    @xmath16 + * remark 2 : * in this paper we shall consider only hamiltonians for which the spectrum is @xmath25 , absolutely continuous , and uniformly degenerate . the results below apply also to the more general case of hamiltonians for which the absolutely continuous spectrum is @xmath25 and is uniformly degenerate . in such cases the constructions below hold in the subspace @xmath26 .",
    "+   + * remark 3 : * note that each complete set of generalized eigentates of @xmath4 has associated with it a different lypaunov operator , and as such theorem 1 represents a prescription for the construction of a family of self - adjoint lyapunov operators . in particular , this still holds true for two sets that differ only by an energy dependent phase .",
    "when discussing general properties of the set of lypaunov operators defined above , we shall often refer to @xmath11 without specifying the underlying complete set of generalized eigenstates .",
    "+   + * remark 4 : * the above family of self - adjoint lyapunov operators has recently been generalized in @xcite .",

    "the transition over time between the two asymptotic components suggests the possibility that this decomposition yields an appropriate description of transient phenomena in the evolution of a quantum system .",
