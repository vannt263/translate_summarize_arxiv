    "in presence of a uniaxial stationary laminar fluid flow , the diffusion of brownian particles along the direction of the flow is enhanced by an amount proportional to the inverse of the molecular diffusion coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "this effect , known as taylor dispersion  @xcite , originates from the combination of the inhomogeneous velocity field experienced by the particles and the diffusive transverse motion which leads to a random sampling of these fast and slow streamlines .",
    "taylor dispersion has implications in many fields , especially those involving chemical reactions and determination of reaction rates such as microfluidics and chromatography , and has thus been the subject of a number of works both at the theoretical and experimental level @xcite . in numerous practical situations , taylor dispersion in the bulk flow is coupled to the adsorption and desorption processes taking place at the walls confining the fluid .",
    "so far , the theoretical analysis of the resulting process has mainly been done explicitly in two limiting situations .    in the first class of models ,",
    "the transverse motion is not explicitly considered , which physically corresponds to the infinitely well stirred limit of high diffusion coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "a representative example is the famous two - state model of chromatography introduced by giddings and eyring in 1955 , in which a particle can be either in the mobile phase ( in the flow ) or in the immobile phase ( adsorbed on the confining walls ) , the rates of change between phases being constant  @xcite .",
    "an important extension concerns the case when the velocity of the mobile phase oscillates with time according to @xmath1  @xcite . in particular , stochastic resonance has been shown to occur if the rates of change between phases are both equal to @xmath2 , leading to a maximum of the dispersion coefficient  @xcite .",
    "this effect has recently proved to have applications in molecular sorting  @xcite .",
    "the second class of models has investigated explicitly the transverse motion , but for specific kinetics of adsorption and desorption : in  @xcite , the dispersion coefficient is calculated when the exchanges with the surface are infinitely fast ( local chemical equilibrium ) , while biswas and sen have considered the situation of irreversible adsorption on the surface  @xcite .",
    "besides , these studies focus on stationary velocity fields and the important case of oscillating velocity fields mentioned above is not considered .    in this article",
    ", we develop a theoretical analysis of taylor dispersion in presence of general adsorption and desorption processes . relying on a stochastic approach ( i ) we derive explicit expressions of the dispersion coefficient for the canonical examples of poiseuille flows in planar and cylindrical geometries , both for stationary and oscillating velocity fields , thus opening the way to the determination of heterogeneous rate constants from the mean velocity and dispersion coefficient ; ( ii ) we recover the fact that",
    ", in the case of a stationary velocity field , the sources of dispersion associated to bulk transport and adsorption and desorption processes combine additively  @xcite ; ( iii ) in the case of an oscillatory velocity field , we show that the dispersion coefficient can be optimized and discuss possible implications in the context of molecular sorting .",

    "the independent gaussian white noises @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined by their correlation functions : @xmath15 the transverse diffusion equation is driven by the evolution equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( resp .",

    "the explicit determination of the pseudo - green function @xmath43 is conveniently performed by first laplace transforming eq.([transverse ] ) , calculating the laplace transform of the propagator and then going to the small laplace variable limit .",

    "a few comments are in order .",
    "( i ) the specific case of infinitely fast exchange with the surface ( local chemical equilibrium ) , considered in the cylindrical case in @xcite as one of the generalizations of taylor dispersion , is recovered in the joint limit @xmath61 with @xmath27 fixed , and is given by the first term of the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the general expression ( [ eq : kpoiseuillebothstatic ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : kpoiseuillebothstatic ] ) .",
    "this second source of dispersion , associated to adsorption and desorption kinetics only , corresponds to the 0-dimensional dispersion coefficient used in the usual two - state model of chromatography  @xcite , with a rate @xmath64 @xmath65 for the transition from mobile to immobile states .",
    "( iii ) note that these two contributions to dispersion turn out to combine themselves additively .",
    "( iv ) the knowledge of the mean displacement @xmath66 ( see eq .  ( [ eq : avgpos ] ) ) and the dispersion coefficient eq .",
    "( [ eq : kpoiseuillebothstatic ] ) enables the experimental determination of @xmath17 and @xmath18 from the measurement of the average velocity and dispersion coefficient for a given species interacting with a given surface .",
    "( v ) it also allows to design a chromatographic column for the separation of a mixture with known adsorption and desorption rates .",
    "however , in the important case where the components of the mixture have different kinetic rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 but similar partitioning coefficients @xmath27 , such a separation is impossible with a stationary flow , since @xmath67 , hence @xmath68 , of all species are similar . as we now proceed to show , efficient sorting can nevertheless be achieved in this case by resorting to an oscillatory flow and exploiting the stochastic resonance between the exchange kinetics and the flow , thereby extending the idea put forward by alcor _",

    "moreover , while the resonance process is rather selective in the small @xmath99 regime , as @xmath87 decreases rapidly around the optimum , figure  [ fig : k3d ] indicates that the selectivity deteriorates when @xmath99 increases .",
    "finally , the optimal dispersion coefficient , enhanced by orders of magnitude by adsorption and desorption at the walls , also decreases with increasing flow frequency ( see figure  [ fig : opt]b ) .",

    "its effect on dispersion is then maximal when the particles spend the same time at the surface and in this boundary layer accessible by diffusion within a flow period ( now regardless of reaction rates provided that the exchange is fast compared to the flow frequency ) .",
    "this optimization of the dispersion coefficient can be used in the context of molecular sorting , where the problem is to isolate a species of given @xmath93 from a mixture .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath112 is an increasing function of @xmath99 , such that @xmath113 for @xmath114 , so that the parameter @xmath46 can be chosen close to @xmath115 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath116 is arbitrarily small and determines the corresponding value of @xmath117 to tune .",
    "finally , this shows that , in principle , one can _ always _ determine parameters @xmath46 and @xmath107 such that @xmath118 is maximal for @xmath93 while maintaining a small value of @xmath99 to ensure efficient sorting , and thus define an optimal setup to be used .",

    "several cases have then to be considered : ( i ) for species such that @xmath125 , the optimal setup for efficient sorting defined above is indeed realizable and the constraint on @xmath107 is irrelevant for all values of @xmath0 ; ( ii ) for species such that @xmath126 , the maximum sorting efficiency can be reached for @xmath127 .",

    "in conclusion , the present study introduces general analytical results which extend previous works on taylor diffusion without adsorption and desorption or on a 0-dimensional two - state model valid only in the perfectly stirred limit .",
    "this approach is not limited to the poiseuille flows considered here as an illustration . in particular , it can be straightforwardly extended to the case of electro - osmotic flows , in which an additional length scale , the debye screening length , can be tuned by changing the ionic strength of the solution .",
