    "the simplest and most general version of the inflationary theory is the chaotic inflation scenario @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "inflation can occur without any recourse to high temperature phase transitions , which was the trademark of old and new inflation .",
    "chaotic inflation may occur in any model where the scalar potential is sufficiently flat , including large - field models with potentials as simple as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , implementing this scenario in supergravity is a challenge .    the main difficulty in coupling chaotic inflation to supergravity is related to the potential @xmath4 . in minimal @xmath5 supergravity , the potential contains terms proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the f - term part of the scalar potential is proportional to @xmath7 , and therefore the potential scales like @xmath8 .",
    "this is much too steep for chaotic inflation at @xmath9 .    one way to overcome",
    "this problem is to find flat directions of the inflaton potential in supergravity , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of this type was proposed in ref .",
    "the basic idea is that instead of considering a minimal potential containing @xmath6 , one may instead consider the potential @xmath10 .",
    "this potential has shift symmetry : it does not depend on the field combination @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the dangerous term @xmath7 is also independent of @xmath11 , which makes the potential flat and suitable for chaotic inflation , with the field @xmath11 playing the role of the inflaton .",
    "the flatness of the potential is broken only by the superpotential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an additional scalar field , which vanishes along the inflationary trajectory . as a result",
    ", the potential in the direction @xmath11 becomes quadratic , as in the simplest version of chaotic inflation .",
    "this work was followed by many related papers on this subject @xcite .",
    "a similar idea was used in the models of chaotic inflation in string theory @xcite ; see @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "our present goal is to continue investigation of chaotic inflation in supergravity following the recent series of papers @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that one can significantly generalize the model of ref .",
    "@xcite by studying more general  potentials of the functional form @xmath14 and by introducing models with a superpotential @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an arbitrary holomorphic function . in this class of models",
    "one can implement the chaotic inflation scenario with an arbitrary inflaton potential .",
    "this means that all observational results which can be successfully interpreted in the context of any phenomenological model of single - field inflation can also be obtained in the context of inflationary models based on supergravity .",
    "moreover , according to @xcite , some models of this type lead to a natural realization of the curvaton scenario @xcite with a controllable level of non - gaussianity of the adiabatic perturbations of the metric .",
    "this extends our possibilities even further .",
    "however , a complete model of inflation in supergravity should address two additional problems .",
    "first of all , it should introduce a small amount of supersymmetry breaking at the end of inflation .",
    "it should also address the cosmological moduli problem , which plagues many cosmological models based on supergravity @xcite .",
    "this is a generic problem for models based on the simplest mechanism for breaking supersymmetry using a linear superpotential @xcite .",
    "one may try to solve this problem with a generalization of the polonyi potential in some of the new cosmological models @xcite using the adiabatic relaxation mechanism proposed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , our investigation of this issue suggests that this mechanism does work for certain versions of our scenario and we discuss this briefly in section iii .",
    "alternatively , one may turn to non - minimal models based on no - scale supergravity @xcite .",
    "while these models can successfully stabilize one of the two flat directions associated with supersymmetry breaking @xcite , one of the flat directions is left unfixed .",
    "while no - scale supergravity may be a step in the right direction , if one wants to consider string theory inspired versions of supergravity , one may need to take into account some unusual but rather generic features of string cosmology based on the kklt mechanism of vacuum stabilization @xcite .",
    "first of all , supersymmetry breaking is a generic feature of the string theory models with vacuum stabilization , which may make other mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking redundant . secondly , supersymmetry breaking in this class of models can not be attributed to the f - term alone ; one should take into account the effect of the uplifting of the potential required for the fine - tuning of the cosmological constant .",
    "one may interpret uplifting either as a soft supersymmetry breaking induced by string theory effects @xcite , or as a d - term contribution @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "the hubble constant during inflation typically must be smaller than the gravitino mass , unless one does something special , e.g. fine - tunes the superpotential of the volume modulus in a specific way ( the kl mechanism ) @xcite .",
    "as we will see , once both of these effects are taken care of , the cosmological moduli problem disappears even without the use of the mechanism proposed in @xcite .    to complete our construction of the inflationary scenario based on supergravity",
    "we need to construct the theory of reheating in this scenario .",
    "as we will see ( see also @xcite ) , reheating in the theories with flat directions has some distinguishing features which we are going to analyze . in particular , the reheating temperature in this class of models is naturally suppressed  @xcite , which simplifies the solution of the cosmological gravitino problem @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will first describe our approach to general inflationary potentials based on @xmath5 supergravity , see section ii . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "after briefly reviewing past ( more traditional ) approaches , we describe the kl model along with some of its phenomenological consequences . in section iv , we introduce a combined theory of inflation and supersymmetry breaking and describe the evolutionary behavior of our 3-field system . reheating in this class of models",
    "is discussed in section v , and our conclusions are summarized in section vi .",
    "this section reviews the supergravity theory of inflation of @xcite .",
    "the inflaton sector consists of two fields : the inflaton field , @xmath17 , and the stabilizer field , @xmath13 .",
    "the real part of the field @xmath17 will play the role of the inflaton .",
    "meanwhile , the fields @xmath13 and @xmath18 will be forced to vanish during inflation .",
    "the scalar potential for uncharged chiral superfields in @xmath5 supergravity is v = e^g ( g_i g^i |jg_|j -3 ) , [ scalarpot ] or using g = k + | w|^2  , v = e^ k ( k^i|jd_i w|d_|j| w-3| w|^2 ) , [ eqn : sugrapotential ] where @xmath19 . for generic potentials , the exponential renders the potential far too steep for inflation .",
    "one way of getting around this problem is to impose a shift symmetry on @xmath17 .",
    "the potential is for simplicity chosen to have functional form k((-|)^2,s|s ) the shift symmetry not only flattens the potential along the real @xmath17 direction , but by rescaling the fields , the field metric can be chosen to be canonically normalized along the inflaton path @xmath20 : @xmath21 . furthermore , using a transformation , @xmath22 can be made to vanish along this path .",
    "the superpotential is chosen to be = sf ( )  , [ cond ] where @xmath16 is a real holomorphic function such that @xmath23 .",
    "any function which can be represented by taylor series with real coefficients has this property .",
    "this superpotential has a number of good properties .",
    "first , both @xmath24 and @xmath25 vanish at @xmath26 . as such , the only non - vanishing contribution to the scalar potential comes from @xmath27 . along the inflaton s trajectory",
    "where @xmath28 , we obtain the amazingly simple potential v=|f()|^2 .",
    "second , the superpotential and potential are odd and even respectively , under the transformation @xmath29 . looking at ( [ eqn : sugrapotential ] ) , we see that this makes the scalar potential invariant and that @xmath26 is , therefore , an extremum .",
    "finally , the reality condition implies that both @xmath30 and @xmath14 are invariant under @xmath31 , making @xmath32 an extremum .",
    "next consider the stability of potential with respect to transverse perturbations .",
    "using the basis s=(s+i),=(+i ) .",
    "the inflaton potential becomes v()=f^2(/ ) .",
    "the masses of these fields were calculated in @xcite and found to be [ genstab2 ] m^2 _ & = & v  , + m^2_s & = & m^2_= v  .",
    "[ masss]where = ( ) ^2= , = = + are slow roll parameters .",
    "the degeneracy is explained by the unbroken r - symmetry @xmath33 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be understood by noting that the inflaton potential is generated by the f - term of the @xmath13 field and the corresponding field metric is ^s|s=. the condition for a transverse scalar field to remain fixed despite quantum fluctuations during inflation is @xmath36 .",
    "if the potential supports slow roll inflation both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are tiny and can be dropped . using @xmath39 we get a condition on @xmath22 : _",
    "|s|s,_s|s s|s- .",
    "note that the stability condition is independent of the details of the inflaton potential as long as the slow roll parameters are sufficiently small .",

    "[ eqmass ]    as long as the inflationary trajectory is stabilized , the explicit expression for the potential does not play any role for inflation . however , it is helpful to consider some particular examples",
    ".    one may consider a simple polynomial potential @xcite that is a generalization of the potential used in @xcite : @xmath41 note that the stabilizing terms @xmath42 were added to the potential of the model of @xcite .",
    "this  geometry has @xmath43 and @xmath44 and the stability conditions during inflation are , for any sufficiently flat @xmath16 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "another example is the logarithmic potential @xcite , that is a generalization of the potential used in @xcite : & = & -3 .",
    "[ ka ] in this case @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the stability conditions with respect to the generation of inflationary perturbations of the fields orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in the inflationary model discussed so far , supersymmetry is unbroken in the vacuum state corresponding to the minimum of the potential with @xmath51 .",
    "there are several ways to introduce supersymmetry breaking to this model .",
    "the simplest way is to add the polonyi field @xmath52 with a linear superpotential @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite . for the choice @xmath55",
    ", the scalar potential has a supersymmetry breaking minkowski minimum .",
    "the gravitino mass is @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , to solve the hierarchy problem , one must tune @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "as is well known , this theory is plagued with a moduli problem @xcite as the two scalars remain light and will eventually dominate the energy density of the universe after inflation .",
    "economically , it would be nice to be able to associate the stabilizer field @xmath13 with the polonyi field @xmath52 , but we were unable to find a successful model of this type .",
    "it is in principle possible to relieve this problem by modifying the theory so that the field @xmath52 obtains a large mass during inflation and adiabatically relaxes to its minimum @xcite .",
    "for example , one could add a quartic term to the  potential @xmath59 and also add a quadratic term to the superpotential so that @xmath60 .",
    "for given values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 must be fine - tuned to recover a minkowski vacuum . for large @xmath61",
    ", adiabatic relaxation will occur @xcite .",
    "another alternative is to begin with a  potential of the no - scale form .",
    "for example , the  potential @xmath64 will fix the real part of @xmath52 , and generate a large gravitino mass ( for large @xmath62 )  @xcite .",
    "however this formalism is only suited for small field inflation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "another choice is @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this model allows for generalized inflationary potentials of the type discussed in the previous section , and fixes the combination @xmath66 .",
    "however , these theories leave behind a ( near ) massless degree of freedom associated with i m @xmath52 .",
    "string theory suggests another approach to supersymmetry breaking , which we are going to pursue in this paper . in string theory",
    ", one must consider stabilization of the volume modulus @xmath67 to explain why our universe is 4d rather than 10d .",
    "the simplest approach to this issue is based on the kklt mechanism @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "one first finds a stable supersymmetric vacuum with a negative vacuum energy density @xmath68 , and then uplifts it until its vacuum energy becomes positive but negligibly small , about @xmath69 in planck units . after the uplifting , supersymmetry breaks down , and the gravitino mass has a simple relation to the depth of the original ads minimum @xcite : m^2_3/2 = |v_ads|/3  .",
    "thus the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking is built into the new generation of string theory models .",
    "one can add to it other mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking , such the polonyi mechanism @xcite , dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite , an oraifeartaigh mechanism @xcite or something else .",
    "however , this would make the models more complicated .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will concentrate on the string theory based mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "one should note that in the simplest versions of the kklt construction a rather unusual problem has to be addressed : the hubble constant during inflation can not be greater than the gravitino mass , @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the reason is that in the simplest kklt models , the barrier separating the stabilized ds vacuum from the 10d minkowski vacuum has a height proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "when the inflationary potential is added to the system , it may lift the ds minimum above the barrier .",
    "if this happens , the universe decompactifies and becomes 10-dimensional .",
    "one can try to solve this problem in several different ways , see for example @xcite .",
    "the simplest mechanism involves a slightly generalized kklt model , which is sometimes called the kl model @xcite . in this model",
    ", the potential of the volume modulus @xmath67 describing the size of compactification is _ = - 3 and instead of the standard kklt superpotential @xmath72 , one uses the racetrack superpotential w _ = w_0 + ae^-a- be^-b  .",

    "thus the problems discussed above associated with fixing _ both _ components of the polonyi - like field are resolved in the kl model .",
    "this hierarchy of mass scales is one of the necessary conditions which is required to ignore the dynamics of the volume modulus @xmath75 during inflation .",
    "more exact requirements will be discussed below .    it will be useful to understand the properties of the kl potential and the mass of the volume modulus under the simultaneous rescaling of the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "this rescaling does not affect the position of the minimum @xmath88 , but it increases the value of @xmath89 and the mass of the volume modulus by a factor @xmath90 , and it increases the height of the barrier in the kl potential by a factor @xmath91 .",
    "meanwhile the simultaneous rescaling @xmath92 and @xmath93 decreases @xmath88 by a factor of @xmath62 , increases @xmath94 by a factor of @xmath95 , and increases the height of the barrier by a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "these facts will be important for our discussion of moduli stabilization during inflation in the context of this scenario .    in the kl model",
    "discussed so far , supersymmetry is unbroken in the vacuum state corresponding to the minimum of the potential with @xmath51 .",
    "the scale of supersymmetry breaking will be determined by a slight perturbation of the superpotential ( [ adssup ] ) by adding to it a small constant @xmath96 .",
    "independent of the sign of @xmath97 , the constant shifts the minimum of the potential @xmath76 from zero to its negative value @xmath98 .",
    "therefore @xmath68 in the first approximation must be proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "after some algebra , one finds that the position of the minimum shifts from @xmath100 by @xmath101 , and the potential at the minimum becomes v_ads(w ) = -3(w)^28 _ 0 ^ 3= - 38 ( a - b ( a ab b))^3 ( w)^2  . [ vads ] in this minimum , the value of the superpotential ( including the additional constant @xmath97 ) , remains equal to @xmath97 up to small corrections @xmath102 .",

    "uplifting of the ads minimum induces supersymmetry breaking and is achieved by adding to the potential a term v |v_ads(w)|  ^n_0^n . in the original kklt construction",
    "it was assumed that @xmath105 @xcite , but according to @xcite @xmath106 in the uplifting term , due to effects related to warping .",
    "one may have @xmath105 if the uplifting occurs due to a d - term @xcite . because of the dependence of the uplifting term on @xmath75 , the minimum after the uplifting shifts to slightly greater values of @xmath75 .",
    "however , this effect is extremely small , being proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , as a first approximation , the position of the minimum , as well as the values of @xmath108 and of its first derivative @xmath109 , remain the same as they were before uplifting , independent of @xmath110 .    after uplifting to the present state with a nearly vanishing vacuum energy ,",
    "the gravitino mass becomes m_3/2 = = 122(a - b ( a ab b))^3/2 |w|  .",
    "in particular , for @xmath111 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , one has @xmath112 . to have @xmath113  tev , which is about @xmath114 in planck units , one should have @xmath115 .",
    "this means that to make the gravitino mass comparable to the electroweak scale , we must introduce a small parameter @xmath116 , which is comparable to the small parameter , @xmath57 , required in the standard polonyi superpotential . this should be done in the context of a special version of the kklt theory which , in the state with @xmath117 , describes a supersymmetric minkowski vacuum .",
    "note that in this class of models , unlike in the simplest kklt models , the mass of the volume modulus , as well as the inflaton mass , can be many orders of magnitude greater than the gravitino mass , and the light polonyi field is not required for supersymmetry breaking .",

    "we do not have a complete answer to this question ; certainly these models are fine - tuned .",
    "however , we would like to mention an interesting aspect of this class of models revealed in @xcite .",
    "vacuum stabilization in string theory is quite complicated because one should achieve stability with respect to * all * string theory moduli .",
    "this problem was solved for a particular class of models , see e.g. @xcite , but it is certainly true that the requirement of stability with respect to all moduli is a significant constraint , limiting the total number of stable string theory vacua . in this respect , it is interesting that all minkowski vacua with unbroken supersymmetry are stable automatically @xcite , due to the positive energy theorem in supergravity @xcite .",
    "we would like to go beyond this simple statement and find what happens when one introduces supersymmetry breaking in the kl model .",

    "it does , however , make analytic treatment hard as the kl- and inflation - sectors can not be disentangled . as a result , for each new set of parameters , one should check numerically whether the field @xmath13 is light , which may lead to isocurvature / curvaton perturbations of metric .",
    "in addition , in the absence of stabilization , the field range where inflation may happen is rather limited , see the first plot in figure [ fig : combinedpotential ] .    meanwhile , in the case when @xmath180 and @xmath181 , the deviations @xmath175 and @xmath182 are very small and the expressions ( [ eqn : displacement ] ) can be trusted .",

    "therefore , for the investigation of the observational consequences of this model , one can simply use the analytical results obtained in @xcite for the simple supergravity model involving only the fields @xmath13 and @xmath17 , ignoring the evolution of the volume modulus in the kl model .",
    "reheating after inflation often can be divided into several qualitatively different stages .",
    "depending on the choice of the inflationary model , reheating may begin with a stage of preheating , a non - perturbative regime of parametric resonance , which rapidly converts the energy of the inflaton field to energy of other particles and classical waves @xcite .",
    "however , eventually this stage ends while some energy still remains stored in the oscillating inflaton field . when the amplitude of this field becomes small enough",
    ", one can use the elementary approach to the theory of reheating which describes the perturbative decay of inflaton particles where the reheating temperature after this decay is given by @xmath194 , and @xmath195 is the inflaton decay rate , in planck units @xcite .",
    "perturbative reheating is efficient and can lead to the complete decay of the inflaton field only if this decay continues at a constant rate @xmath195 in the limit when the amplitude of the oscillations of the inflaton field vanishes .",
    "in other words , it should be a decay process @xmath196 rather than some interaction @xmath197 .",
    "this condition is not automatically satisfied in our class of models .",
    "suppose , for example , that in addition to the fields @xmath17 , @xmath13 and @xmath198 , we also have matter fields @xmath199 .",
    "consider the diagrams @xmath200 .",
    "the corresponding interaction constant is proportional to @xmath201 at the minimum of the potential .",
    "this is a straightforward calculation and we find _ , y , yv = f ( ) f ( ) , [ phiyy ] when evaluated at the minimum of @xmath0 with @xmath202 .",
    "but in our model @xmath203 , so at the minimum of the potential in a ( nearly ) minkowski vacuum , the decay constant for the process @xmath200 vanishes .",
    "we next check the coupling of the inflaton to standard model fermions . starting with the chiral fermion mass matrix , e^g/2|^i(g_ij+g_ig_j - g_ij    goldstino component",

    "but because @xmath204 at the minimum and we have assumed @xmath205 , there are no direct decays of the inflaton to chiral fermions .",
    "a similar argument pertains to the coupling of the inflaton to a scalar - fermion - gaugino .    in more conventional minimal supergravity models",
    ", there is in fact a minimal decay rate for the inflaton through 3-body gravitational decays @xcite and places constraints on inflationary models from the overproduction of gravitinos @xcite .",
    "indeed , our computation of the direct decay of the inflaton to matter includes gravitational decays but other channels including the decay to gravitinos are possible , and we check these as well . for example , in the kl model , one can compute the inflaton couplings to the modulus @xmath75 .",
    "however , we find this coupling is the same as in eq .",

    "indeed , it would appear that there are _ no _ decay channels available for inflaton decay .",
    "this is very reminiscent of the situation in no - scale supergravity @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility that the inflaton can decay to a single gravitino and inflatino .",
    "this coupling is given by e^g/2 g_i |_^^i .",
    "therefore the decay constant for @xmath210 gravitino is e^g/2 g_i = e^k/2 ( k_i w + w_i ) .",
    "decays of an inflaton to a gravitino plus inflatino ( @xmath211 ) are suppressed because the first term is proportional to the gravitino mass ( @xmath212 ) and the second term vanishes ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "however , in principle decays to a gravitino + an @xmath13-ino are possible since @xmath214 .",
    "while this decay does not contribute to reheating , it could be problematic because of the generation of gravitinos .",
    "however , for @xmath215 , there is a phase space suppression of order @xmath216 @xcite , for this decay due to degeneracy ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "there is one remaining channel to check , the decay of the inflaton to the stabilizers , @xmath13 . according to ( [ eqmass ] ) , the masses of the fields @xmath153 and @xmath155 are equal to each other at the minimum of the potential , and therefore the decay @xmath218 ( as well as the decay @xmath219 which we will discuss later ) is kinematically forbidden .    the suppression of the decay probability of the inflaton field is simultaneously a curse and a blessing .",
    "it is a blessing because with the decay suppressed , the reheating temperature can easily satisfy the bound @xmath220 tev , which is usually required to avoid the cosmological gravitino problem for a gravitino at the tev mass scale @xcite .",
    "it is a curse because this result implies that unless we do something else , there will be no reheating in this model .    as noted above , the absence of a decay route for the inflaton was generic in no - scale supergravity @xcite .",
    "however , there remains a possibility for inflatons to decay to gauge fields and gauginos through a coupling in the gauge kinetic function @xcite , @xmath221 .",
    "the supergravity lagrangian terms of interest include @xmath222 indeed , a non - trivial gauge kinetic function is necessary for the generation of gaugino masses . for example , for a suitable choice",
    "@xmath223 one could find m_1/2 m_3/2 .",
    "therefore , we can in addition include the inflaton dependence in @xmath224 h _ = ( h ( ) + d _ ) _ .",
    "[ hab ] this would have no effect on the gaugino mass as @xmath225 .",
    "however , we would induce a coupling to gauge bosons - f^_f^ = - f^_f^ .",
    "similarly we induce a coupling to gauginos , @xmath226 where we have used @xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "thus , the decay to gauginos is suppressed by a factor of @xmath216 relative to the decay to gauge bosons .    using a non - trivial gauge kinetic function as in eq .",
    "( [ hab ] ) , we can compute the total decay rate into gauge bosons as ( a_a _ ) ~10 ^ -2 d_^2   . [ grate ] note that this decay rate is suppressed by a factor @xmath229 as compared to the standard expectation for the rate of decay of the inflaton field in supergravity @xmath230 .",
    "this reduces the reheating temperature , which makes it easier to solve the primordial gravitino problem .    to give a particular example",
    ", one may consider the simplest chaotic inflation model with @xmath231 and @xmath232 , in plank mass units .",
    "our results imply the reheating temperature of order t_r ~d _ 10 ^ 9   gev  . as long as @xmath233 ,",
    "excessive reheating and the thermal production of gravitinos will not occur .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to discuss what may happen in those versions of our model where the field @xmath13 remains very light during inflation and its perturbations are generated , in addition to the perturbations of the inflaton field . in this case , at the end of inflation the field @xmath13 does not exactly vanish , but instead it takes different values in different parts of the universe .",
    "one can show that the decay of the field @xmath13 to matter fields is also suppressed .",
    "in particular , the vertex @xmath234 corresponding to decay @xmath235 in the limit @xmath236 is proportional to @xmath237 , so it vanishes when evaluated at the minimum of @xmath0 with @xmath202 , @xmath238 .",
    "if the field @xmath13 does not decay , its perturbations will result in undesirable isocurvature perturbations of metric .",
    "however , just as the inflaton field , the field @xmath13 may decay due to the interaction to vector fields with an analogous coupling constant @xmath239 .",
    "if @xmath240 , the field @xmath13 may decay much later than the inflaton field , as in the curvaton scenario @xcite . in this case the perturbations of the field @xmath13 generated during inflation produce adiabatic perturbations of metric . under certain conditions , these perturbations of metric may be non - gaussian , which may provide additional flexibility to fit new and coming observational data .",
    "however , the curvaton scenario requires many additional nuts and bolts @xcite .",
    "for example , it could lead to a significant non - gaussianity under the condition that the amplitude @xmath241 is relatively large . to make this condition compatible with the smallness of the perturbations of metric ,",
    "one may require , e.g. , that the main contribution to the density of the universe at the time of the decay of the field @xmath13 is given not by the classical field @xmath13 , but by the @xmath13-particles produced during reheating @xcite .",
    "but in the simplest version of our model the inflaton field does not decay to @xmath13-particles .",
    "one can construct models where such a decay is possible due to non - perturbative effects at the very end of inflation or at the early stages of reheating , e.g. due to a temporary destabilization of the field @xmath13 at the end of inflation .",
    "this can be achieved by a proper choice of the potential , see @xcite for a discussion of a closely related regime .",
    "thus , one can implement the curvaton scenario in our model , but it requires additional specification and tuning of its parameters .",
    "meanwhile in the regime @xmath242 , which is perhaps more natural , the field @xmath13 decays before or shortly after the decay of the inflaton field . in this regime ,",
    "the contribution of the field @xmath13 and the products of its decay to the energy density of the universe typically remains much smaller than the corresponding contribution of the inflaton field . in this case",
    ", the perturbations of the field @xmath13 do not lead to significant perturbations of metric , so one can safely ignore the perturbations of the field @xmath13 even if its mass is much smaller than @xmath148 during inflation .",
    "therefore in this regime the perturbations of metric are correctly described by the theory of the single inflaton field @xmath153 .",
    "in this paper , we incorporated the recently developed class of models of chaotic inflation in supergravity @xcite into a theory of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we analyzed the possibility of introducing low - scale susy breaking based on the kl model of vacuum stabilization in string theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism does not require the introduction of additional moduli fields responsible for susy breaking , such as polonyi fields .",
    "this solves the cosmological moduli problem which plagues many cosmological models based on supergravity .",
    "furthermore , this mechanism of susy breaking has certain distinguishing features which can be tested experimentally .",
    "the models of refs . @xcite",
    "describe inflation with an arbitrary inflaton potential , which corresponds to a flat direction in the  manifold .",
    "in general , unification of these models with the models describing volume modulus stabilization in string theory is rather nontrivial .",
    "the large energy density of the inflaton field may affect other scalars ( the moduli ) and bend or even eliminate the flat direction of the potential .",
    "this may make inflation impossible @xcite , or at least make it much more complicated , requiring a detailed numerical investigation of the simultaneous evolution of many different scalar fields @xcite .",
    "fortunately , our results show that in the class of models of refs . @xcite unified with the kl model one can stabilize the inflationary trajectory and preserve the potential along the inflationary direction for a very large range of the values of the inflaton potential @xmath0 . in other words",
    ", one can reach a certain decoupling , when the kl scenario takes care of the volume modulus stabilization in string theory , as well as the low - scale susy breaking , whereas all observational consequences of inflation remain the same as in the simple supergravity models of refs .",
    "@xcite .    finally , we analyzed reheating after inflation in this scenario .",
    "we have shown ( see also @xcite ) that the standard mechanism of reheating with the decay rate @xmath243 does not work in this class of inflationary models because the flatness of the inflationary potential is related to the vanishing of the potential along the inflationary trajectory .",
    "however , the inflatons can decay to gauge fields and gauginos through a coupling in the gauge kinetic function .",
    "this leads to a natural suppression of the decay rate and simplifies the solution of the cosmological gravitino problem .    in conclusion",
    ", we constructed a broad class of string theory inspired models of chaotic inflation in supergravity , with a functional freedom of choice of the inflaton potential and the potential .",
