    "nasa s _ kepler _  mission , launched in march 2009 , uses transit photometry to detect and characterize exoplanets with the objective of determining the frequency of earth - size planets in the habitable zone .",
    "the instrument is a wide field - of - view ( 115 square degrees ) photometer comprised of a 0.95-meter effective aperture schmidt telescope feeding an array of 42 ccds that continuously and simultaneously monitors the brightness of up to 170,000 stars .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the characteristics and on - orbit performance of the instrument and spacecraft is presented in @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the stars targeted by _ kepler _  are described by @xcite .    in january , 2010",
    ", the team announced its first 5 planet discoveries @xcite identified in the first 43 days of data and confirmed by radial velocity(rv ) follow - up .",
    "one of these ",
    "kepler-8b  shows a clear rossiter - mclaughlin velocity variation which allowed for the measurement of the spin - orbit alignment of the system @xcite .",
    "the `` first five '' are all short - period giant planets , the smallest being comparable in size to neptune . collectively , they are similar to the sample of transiting exoplanets that have been identified to date , the ranks of which currently hover around 100 . the median mass of the sample is 0.99 @xmath19  with a 10@xmath20 and 90@xmath20 percentile of 0.24 @xmath19  and 4.1 @xmath19 .",
    "the median radius is 1.18 @xmath21  with a 10@xmath20 and 90@xmath20 percentile of 0.81 @xmath21  and 1.5 @xmath21 .",
    "the known transiting planets are , statistically speaking , jovian - like in both mass and size and have short orbital periods with a median value of 3.5 days and a 10@xmath20 and 90@xmath20 percentile of 1.5 days and 8.0 days , respectively .    in june 2010 , _",
    "kepler _  released a catalog of 306 stars with planet - like transit signatures @xcite . even if the majority turn out to be false positives , the number of transiting planets could plausibly more than double from this pool of candidates .",
    "soon , we will leave the realm of small - sample statistics and be able to say something meaningful about not only the mass and size distribution but also the dynamical and compositional nature of exoplanets .",
    "information about composition will fall from those systems for which we can derive not only a radius , but also a mass .",
    "dynamical information will fall from multiple - transiting planet systems .",
    "five such candidate systems were included in the catalog of @xcite and described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the planets orbiting kepler-9",
    "@xcite marked the first confirmation of a multiple - transiting planet system .",
    "kepler-9 is a g - type star with two saturn - mass transiting planets in a near @xmath22 orbital resonance .",
    "the system is also the first to show transit timing variations .",
    "dynamical models of these variations afford us the means of determining planetary mass without the need for rv follow - up .    after removing the transit signals of kepler-9b and kepler-9c ,",
    "a third transit signature was identified in the light curve revealing an additional candidate with a 1.6-day period .",
    "the planetary interpretation of kepler-9d was validated @xcite without detection of a doppler signal .",
    "rather , given the star and transit properties , a matrix of possible false - positive scenarios was constructed .",
    "after eliminating all scenarios which are not consistent with the observables , a false - alarm probability was computed that speaks to the likelihood that kepler-9d is consistent with the planet interpretation . in this manner ,",
    "kepler-9d was validated with high confidence as a super - earth - size planet with radius @xmath23 @xmath16 .    here",
    ", we attempt to define `` super - earth '' from a radius perspective by noting that the 10 @xmath14  upper limit proposed by @xcite corresponds roughly to 2 @xmath16  for a planet with no water and low fe / si ratio @xcite . practically speaking",
    ", the term super - earth has been loosely used to refer to all planets larger than earth and smaller than neptune .",
    "however , this is a broad domain that captures not only rocky , dry planets that happen to be larger than earth , but also ocean planets and mini - neptunes .",
    "these finer distinctions will only be possible with measurements of planetary properties better than @xmath24 in radius and @xmath25 in mass @xcite .",
    "pending a mass determination , there is no information as of yet with regards to the composition of kepler-9d .",
    "the discovery of a short - period , super - earth - size planet is not surprising . indeed ,",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the _ kepler _  candidate sample reported by @xcite is the fact that the median of the radius distribution is strikingly different than that of the known transiting exoplanets .",
    "the _ kepler _  candidates have a median radius of 0.30 @xmath21   smaller than that of neptune ( 0.34 @xmath21 )  and candidates as small as 1.5 @xmath16 .",
    "should this distribution survive the process of false positive elimination , we will see substantial numbers of short - period super - earths .",
    "there is precedence already for transiting exoplanet discoveries in the super - earth domain .",
    "corot-7b @xcite is an example : a @xmath26 @xmath16 , @xmath27 @xmath14  planet orbiting a k - type star . the case for corot-7b is complicated by activity - induced rv jitter .",
    "independent analysis of the doppler measurements by @xcite reduces the significance of the detection somewhat ( yielding @xmath28 @xmath14 ) and puts the 95% confidence interval between 0 and 5 @xmath14   still , however , within the super - earth domain . and",
    "while the @xcite mass and radius point to a rocky composition , the lower mass of @xcite marginally favors a water / ice composition .",
    "gj 1214b @xcite is another example of a transiting super - earth ( as defined from a mass perspective ) at 6.55 @xmath14 . orbiting an m - type star with a period of 1.58 days",
    ", gj1214b has a radius of 2.68 @xmath16 .",
    "its density ( 1.87 g @xmath18 ) , consequently , is closer to that of water than that of the earth .",
    "the interior structure of gj 1214b has been modeled as an h / he / h@xmath29o planet with a rocky core @xcite .    here",
    ", we report on the discovery of a super - earth - size exoplanet orbiting the g - type main sequence star , kepler-10  ( kic  11904151 ) . at kp@xmath30 ,",
    "the star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis of its fundamental stellar properties using the high precision _ kepler",
    "_  photometry .",
    "the stellar properties are known to an accuracy that allows us to put kepler-10b  sitting squarely in the rocky domain of the mass - radius diagram .",
    "the light curve shows two distinct sets of transit events : one at @xmath31 days , referred to as koi-72.01 and the other at @xmath32 days , referred to as koi-72.02  where `` koi '' denotes a _ kepler _",
    "object of interest .",
    "the kepler-10  data acquisition , photometry and transit detection are described in section  [ sec : photometry ] .",
    "the statistical tests performed on the _ kepler _  photometry to rule out false positives are described in section  [ sec : dv ] , and the subsequent ground - based observations , including precision doppler measurements , leading to the confirmation of koi-72.01  are described in section  [ sec : fop ] . throughout the first half of this paper , we refer to each event as koi-72.01  and koi-72.02 .",
    "however , in the latter half , we begin to discuss koi-72.01  in the context of a confirmed planet and call it out accordingly as kepler-10b .",
    "the koi-72.02  signal , at this time , has not been confirmed by rv .",
    "many of the false - positive scenarios have been investigated via blender  analysis @xcite as described in section  [ sec : blender ] .",
    "koi-72.02  will require analysis beyond the scope of this paper for validation at an acceptable confidence level , since eliminating possible astrophysical false positives is more difficult given the possibility of an eccentric orbit .",
    "the larger orbital separation of koi-72.02  precludes us from assuming that tidal effects will have circularized the orbit .",
    "while both the transit duration and rv observations are consistent with a circular orbit , the uncertainties are large enough that a much more comprehensive blender  analysis will be required to validate the outer planet candidate .",
    "thus , we refer to this candidate throughout the paper as koi-72.02 .",
    "from spectroscopy to asteroseismology , the analyses yielding fundamental stellar properties are discussed in section  [ sec : star ] .",
    "section  [ sec : planet ] contains a description of the light curve plus radial velocity modeling that yield the planet properties of kepler-10b  ( and koi-72.02  under the planet interpretation ) . in the case of koi-72.02 the absence of an rv signal implies an upper mass limit .",
    "we look for small , systematic deviations in the transit arrival times that could indicate the dynamical interaction of multiple planets orbiting kepler-10 .",
    "the implications of a null detection are discussed in section  [ sec : ttv ] .",
    "finally , the properties of kepler-10b  are discussed in the context of the theoretical models that speak to the planet s composition .",
    "its placement in a mass - radius diagram suggests a dry , rocky composition .",
    "moreover , the high density ( @xmath33 g @xmath18 ) indicates a large iron mass fraction as discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "_ kepler s _ primary objective is to determine the frequency of earth - size planets in the habitable zone .",
    "the number of planet candidates identified in @xmath34 year of photometry is fast approaching the thousands .",
    "time on the large telescopes required for precision doppler measurements is not only costly , it is insufficient for confirming earth - size planets in the hz of sun - like stars",
    ". instruments are not yet capable of yielding the cm s@xmath35 precision required for confirmation of _ kepler s _ most interesting candidates .",
    "for the near - term future , the team will focus its efforts on quantifying the false - positive rate well enough that it might be applied to the collective sample of planet candidates .",
    "the observations of kepler-10  are part of that effort .",
    "the discovery of kepler-10b  marks an important milestone for the team : _ kepler s _ first rocky planet and the smallest transiting exoplanet discovered to date .",
    "the discovery of the planet orbiting kepler-10  begins with the high - precision _ kepler _  photometry . indeed",
    "not one but two periodic transit events were identified in the light curve , producing pipeline statistics that initiated the cascade of verification and follow - up efforts leading to confirmation and characterization of kepler-10b .",
    "the _ kepler _  photometer is a 0.95-m effective aperture , wide field of view schmidt camera in an earth - trailing orbit .",
    "it is designed to yield 20 parts per million relative time series precision in 6.5-hours for a 12th magnitude g2 star .",
    "the focal plane is comprised of 42 1024x2200 pixel science ccds arranged together in 21 roughly square modules covering 115 square degrees of sky ( 3.98 arcsec per pixel ) .",
    "each pair of ccds forming a module shares a common sapphire field - flattener lens .",
    "the coatings deposited onto the field - flattener lenses ( and , to a lesser degree , the optics and quantum efficiency of the ccds ) define the effective bandpass of the otherwise filter - less photometer , yielding a mean transmission of 52.6% between 423 and 897 nm ( defining the 5% transmission points ) .",
    "each ccd requires its own transmission function for meaningful interpretation of color - dependent behaviors that affect planet characterization ( e.g. limb darkening ) .",
    "a description of the instrument is given in @xcite and @xcite while an overview of its in - flight performance is presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "each ccd is electronically divided into two 1024x1100 output units defining a total of 84 readout channels .",
    "while the photometer points at a single field continuously throughout its heliocentric orbit , it rotates about the optical axis once every @xmath363 months ( hereafter referred to as a quarter ) in order to keep the solar panels facing the sun .",
    "consequently , every star spends each quarter of the year on a different channel .",
    "kepler-10  ( ra@xmath37 , dec@xmath38 ) falls on channels 36 ( module 11 , output 4 ) , 80 ( module 23 , output 4 ) , 52 ( module 15 , output 4 ) , and 8 ( module 3 , output 4 ) in quarters 0/1 ( spring ) , 2 ( summer ) , 3 ( fall ) , and 4 ( winter ) , respectively .",
    "ccds are read out every @xmath39 seconds ( @xmath40 second integration and @xmath41 second read time ) , and every 270 readouts are co - added onboard to form @xmath42 second ( @xmath43 minute ) integrations ( long - cadence ) .",
    "data for up to @xmath44 stars are recorded at long - cadence ( lc ) while data for up to 512 stars are also co - added to a @xmath45 second ( @xmath46 minute ) integration ( 9 readouts ) termed short - cadence ( sc ) as described in @xcite .",
    "the lc photometry of kepler-10  used in the analyses reported here was acquired between 02 may 2009 and 09 january 2010  quarters 0/1 ( spring ) up through the first month of quarter 4 ( winter ) . in early january , the module containing channel 8 experienced a hardware failure that was not recoverable and observations of kepler-10  were cut short until the subsequent spacecraft roll .",
    "over 11,000 long - cadence observations are used in this analysis .",
    "short cadence data were also collected between 21 july - 19 august 2009 ( one month of quarter 2 ) and between 18 september 2009 through 09 january 2010 ( quarter 3 and the first weeks of quarter 4 ) .",
    "the short - cadence data were vital in determining the fundamental stellar parameters from an asteroseismic analysis ( p - mode detection ) described in section  [ sec : astero ] .",
    "approximately 200,000 sc observations were collected in this time period . both lc and",
    "sc data are used in the light curve modeling carried out to characterize the planets .",
    "observations of kepler-10  continue in the three quarters each year when the target is not on the failed module .",
    "raw flux light curves are extracted by performing an unweighted sum of calibrated pixels that have been subjected to cosmic ray removal and background subtraction @xcite .",
    "the pixels used in the sum are those defining the optimal aperture  the set of pixels that optimizes the total signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the optimal aperture is dependent on the local pixel response function ( prf ) , measured on - orbit during the commissioning period @xcite , the distribution of stellar flux on the sky near the target ( crowding ) , and differential velocity aberration . a complete discussion of _ kepler s _ aperture photometry pipeline ( pa ) is given in @xcite .",
    "systematic errors , outliers and intra - quarter discontinuities are removed by cotrending against ancillary data products in the pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) pipeline module as described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawflux ] shows the raw ( upper panel ) and corrected ( lower panel ) flux time series for kepler-10 .",
    "vertical lines denote the boundaries between quarters .",
    "intra - quarter fluxes were normalized by their median flux in order to reduce the magnitude of the flux discontinuities between quarters .",
    "the largest systematic errors are the long - term drifts due to image motion ( differential velocity aberration ) and the thermal transients after safe mode events ( e.g. that near day 115 ) .",
    "after filtering out transit events , the measured relative standard deviation of the pdc - corrected , long - cadence light curve is @xmath47 ppm per ( lc ) cadence .",
    "an expected instrument @xmath48 photon noise is computed for each flux in the time series .",
    "the mean of the per ( 29.4-minute ) cadence noise estimates reported by the pipeline is 36 ppm .",
    "both raw ( pa ) and corrected ( pdc ) light curves are available at the multi - mission archive at space telescope science institute mast .    with regards to the time stamps associated with each photometric flux",
    ", we note that _ kepler s _ fundamental coordinate system is utc for all time tags .",
    "spacecraft times are converted to barycentric - corrected julian dates at the mid - time of each cadence .",
    "the kepler-10b  transits were identified by the transiting planet search ( tps ) pipeline module that searches through each systematic error - corrected flux time series for periodic sequences of negative pulses corresponding to transit signatures .",
    "the approach is a wavelet - based , adaptive matched filter that characterizes the power spectral density of the background process ( i.e. anything that is not related to the transit signal itself , such as stellar variability , instrumental signatures , differential velocity aberration - induced photometric drift , etc ) yielding the observed light curve and uses this time - variable power spectral density estimate to realize a pre - whitening filter to apply to the light curve @xcite .",
    "tps then convolves a transit waveform , whitened by the same pre - whitening filter as the data , with the whitened data to obtain a time series of single event statistics .",
    "these represent the likelihood that a transit of that duration is present at each time step .",
    "the single event statistics are then combined into multiple event statistics by folding them at trial orbital periods ranging from 0.5 days to as long as one quarter ( @xmath3690 days ) .",
    "the step sizes in period and epoch are chosen to control the minimum correlation coefficient between neighboring transit models used in the search so as to maintain a high sensitivity to transit sequences in the data .",
    "koi-72.01  was identified by tps in each quarter of data with a multiple event statistic @xmath49 .",
    "the long - period transits of koi-72.02  were identified by manual inspection due to the fact that the current version of tps does not operate on more than one quarter of data at a time making detection of events with periods beyond @xmath50 days necessarily incomplete .",
    "multi - quarter functionality is slated for the next software release in early 2011 .",
    "the transit depth , duration , period , and epoch are derived from physical modeling ( see section  [ sec : planet ] ) using all of the available data .",
    "koi-72.01  is characterized as a @xmath51  ppm dimming lasting @xmath52  hours with transit ephemeris of t[bjd]@xmath53 days .",
    "koi-72.02  is characterized as a @xmath54  ppm dimming lasting @xmath55  hours and an ephemeris t[bjd]@xmath56 days .",
    "astrophysical signals mimicking planet transits are routinely picked up by the pipeline .",
    "the large majority of such false positives can be identified via statistical tests performed on the _ kepler _  data itself  tests that are collectively referred to as _",
    "data validation_. data validation for _ kepler s _ first planet discoveries ( kepler-4b , 5b , 6b , 7b , and 8b ) is described in @xcite .",
    "these are gradually being replaced by pipeline software products such as those described in @xcite . only targets passing each of these statistical tests are passed on to the follow - up observation program team for further vetting , confirmation , and characterization .",
    "it is at this stage that stars are assigned a `` _ kepler _  object of interest '' ( koi ) number .",
    "kepler-10  was referred to as koi-72 throughout the vetting stages .",
    "more specifically , the short - period event was referred to as koi-72.01  while the long - period event was referred to as koi-72.02 .",
    "we will use these identifiers in the subsequent discussions of the analyses that led to confirmation . here",
    "we describe the data validation metrics  statistics which , taken alone , support the planet interpretation for both koi-72.01  and koi-72.02 .      for each event , the even - numbered transits and odd - numbered transits are modeled independently using the techniques described in section  [ sec : planet ] .",
    "the depth of the phase - folded even - numbered transits is compared to that of the odd - numbered transits as described in @xcite . a statistically significant difference in the transit depths",
    "is an indication of a diluted or grazing eclipsing binary system .",
    "neither of the transit events detected in the light curve of kepler-10  shows odd - even depth differences outside of @xmath57 where @xmath58 refers to the uncertainty in the transit depths reported in section  [ sec : tps ] ( 6 and 9 ppm for koi-72.01  and koi-72.02 respectively ) .",
    "the modeling allows for the presence of a secondary eclipse ( or occultation event ) near phase=0.5 and reports the significance of such a signal . while its presence does not rule out the planetary interpretation , it acts as a flag for further investigation .",
    "more specifically , the flux decrease is translated into a surface temperature assuming a thermally radiating disk , and this temperature is compared to the equilibrium temperature of a low albedo ( 0.1 ) planet at the modeled distance from the parent star .",
    "there is a marginal detection ( @xmath59 ) of a secondary eclipse associated with koi-72.01 . at just 6 ppm ,",
    "the flux change is not severe enough to rule out the planetary interpretation ( i.e. that it is due to an occultation of a planetary companion ) .",
    "there is no detection of a secondary eclipse associated with koi-72.02 .",
    "the binarity tests are consistent with the planet interpretation for both transit events in the light curve of kepler-10",
    ".      to check for false positives due to background eclipsing binaries , we study the behavior of flux centroids  the center - of - light distribution in the photometric aperture  and how it behaves as a function of time , especially comparing images taken during transits with those taken outside of transit .",
    "we rely primarily on flux - weighted centroids and modeling the expected behavior based on the local distribution of point sources from the _ kepler _  input catalog and supplemented by high spatial resolution imaging ( section  [ sec : imaging ] ) .",
    "neither speckle nor ao imaging reveal any point sources in the photometric aperture that were not already listed in the _ kepler _  input catalog .",
    "the study of centroid behavior is complicated by the fact that the kepler-10  image is saturated in all quarters . in quarter 2 ,",
    "the star is on the edge of saturation , but it is apparent that there is some spilling of charge even in this case .",
    "saturation behavior on the _ kepler _  focal plane is known to be conservative ( e.g. all charge is captured ) but has strong pixel - to - pixel variation in details such as saturation level and the fraction of flux that spills up and down the ccd columns .",
    "the high - accuracy technique of fitting the pixel response function ( prf ) to the difference image formed by subtracting the in - transit image from the out - of - transit image is inappropriate for saturated targets , because the saturated pixels do not represent the prf of the star , and such mismatches between the pixel data and the prf cause significant position biases in the prf fit . as an alternative ,",
    "we use a modified prf fit technique , described below .",
    "we compute flux - weighted centroids by creating out - of - transit and in - transit images from detrended , folded pixel time series .",
    "separate images are created for koi-72.01  and koi-72.02 . for each pixel time series ,",
    "the de - trending operation has three steps : 1 ) removal of a median filtered time series with a window size equal to the larger of 48 cadences or three times the transit duration ; 2 ) removal of a robust low - order polynomial fit ; and 3 ) the application of a savitzky - golay filtered time series of order 3 with a width of 10 cadences ( 5 hours ) .",
    "the savitzky - golay filter is not applied within 2 cadences of a transit event , so the transits are preserved .",
    "the resulting pixel time series are folded by the transit period .",
    "each pixel in the out - of - transit image is the average of 30 points taken from the folded time series outside the transit , 15 points on each side of the transit event .",
    "each pixel in the in - transit image is the average of as many points in the transit as possible : three for koi-72.01  and eleven for koi-72.02 . in the former case , though there are fewer points per transit , there are significantly more transits to draw from ( several hundred for koi-72.01  compared to just six for koi-72.02 ) .",
    "consequently , koi-72.01  yields smaller uncertainties .",
    "a flux - weighted centroid is computed for the out - of - transit image and the in - transit - image using all of the pixels in the mask of kepler-10 .",
    "this produces row and column centroid offsets @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and the centroid offset distance @xmath62 .",
    "uncertainties of these centroids are estimated via monte carlo simulation , where a noise realization is injected into 48-cadence smoothed versions of the pixel time series for each trial .",
    "a total of 2000 trials are performed each for koi-72.01  and koi-72.02 .",
    "the in- and out - of - transit images are formed using the same de - trending , folding and averaging as the flight data .",
    "the measured uncertainties are in the range of a few times @xmath63 pixels .",
    "table  [ tab : measured_centroids_01 ] shows the resulting measurements of the koi-72.01  centroids from quarter 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 pixel data , along with the monte - carlo - based @xmath64 uncertainties .",
    "the centroids are converted into centroid offsets and offset distance with propagated uncertainties .",
    "we see that while in quarter 1 there is a @xmath65 observed offset , in quarters 2 and 3 the observed offset is less than @xmath66 .",
    "quarter 1 had significant thermal and pointing systematics , while quarter 2 had significant pointing drift .",
    "these systematics were significantly reduced by quarter 3 .",
    "table  [ tab : measured_centroids_02 ] shows the measured centroid shifts and uncertainties for koi-72.02  in quarters 1 through 4 .",
    "the koi-72.02  transit uncertainties in quarter 3 are smaller because only one transit was observed in quarters 1 , 2 , and 4 while two transits were observed in quarter 3 . generally , the centroid shifts for koi-72.02are larger than koi-72.01",
    ". this larger centroid shift may be indicative of the koi-72.02  transit event being due to a background eclipsing binary , or the larger shift may be due to the deeper transits of koi-72.02  ( larger flux changes induce larger centroid shifts ) combined with the complex behavior of pixels at or near saturation . to study this question prf - fit centroids that ignore saturated",
    "pixels are computed for the koi-72.02  in- and out - of - transit images , and the resulting centroid shifts are computed .",
    "these results are shown in table  [ tab : prf_centroids_02 ] .",
    "this technique indicates no statistically detectable centroid motion in quarter 3 .",
    "the uncertainties were computed via monte - carlo methods similar to those used to compute the flux - weighted centroid uncertainties .",
    "while both the flux - weighted centroid and prf fitting methods indicate statistically significant centroid motion on koi-72.02  in quarters 1 , 2 , and 4 , we point out that the directions of the centroid offsets are inconsistent from quarter to quarter .",
    "this indicates that these centroid offsets are not likely to be due to a background object in the sky .",
    "the observed centroids are compared with the modeled centroids computed using point sources catalogued in the _ kepler _  input catalog ( kic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) out to 15 pixels beyond the mask .",
    "as described in sections  [ sec : speckle ] and [ sec : ao ] , no additional point sources were identified in speckle or ao imaging . to generate the modeled out - of - transit image ,",
    "the measured prf is placed at each star s location on the focal plane , scaled by that star s flux .",
    "this provides the contribution of each star to the flux in the mask . for each star @xmath67 in the mask ,",
    "the depth @xmath68 of a transit is computed that reproduces the observed depth in the individual pixels . an in - transit image for each @xmath67 is similarly but with @xmath67 s flux suppressed by @xmath69 .",
    "these model images are subject to errors in the prf @xcite , so they will not exactly match the sky .",
    "further , a very simple saturation model is applied which spills saturation symmetrically up and down the column .",
    "the modeled centroids ( using the quarter 3 mask definition ) are presented in table  [ tab : modeled_offsets ] . for both koi-72.01  and koi-72.02",
    "the offset expected for a transit associated with kepler-10  ( and not a nearby star ) is smaller than the @xmath66 uncertainties in @xmath70 computed from the flux - weghted centroid measurements .",
    "modeled transits on other stars in the mask predict centroid shift in excess of @xmath71 , which would be readily observed in our flux - weighted centroids .",
    "we can therefore rule out all known stars in the mask as responsible for the transit signal on both koi-72.01  and koi-72.02 .",
    "there is a radius beyond which any star capable of producing the observed transit signal would also induce a centroid shift large enough to be detected in the _ kepler _  data when comparing in- and out - of - transit images .",

    "nearby stars with @xmath82  near @xmath109 k and @xmath83  near 4.35 such as koi-72  have been previously surveyed for precise doppler work , revealing a noise - like `` jitter '' of @xmath362.5 @xmath102caused by surface effects including turbulence , spots on the rotating star , acoustic oscillations , and atmospheric flows associated with magnetic flux tubes .",

    "we have included a jitter of 2.0 @xmath102  in the model fit to all of the data , photometric and velocities .",
    "a periodogram ( figure  [ fig : rvperiodogram ] ) of the velocities exhibits a tall peak at a period of 0.837 d , in agreement with the photometric period of the koi-72.01 .",
    "the coincidence between the transit and rv periods to three significant digits suggests that the rv period is physically related to the transits , as expected if the rv periodicity stems from the reflex motion of the star in response to the gravitational influence of the planet .",
    "the periodogram also shows a peak at a period near 1.2 d , which is the alias resulting from the nightly observational cadence .",
    "similarly , there is another peak near a period of 5 days ( off the figure ) that is the alias caused by the beating of the 0.827 d period with the 1.0 d cadence of observations .",
    "there is no indication of power at the period of koi-72.02 .",
    "the velocities phased to the photometric period of koi-72.01  ( figure  [ fig : rv_phased ] ) show a clear , continuous , and nearly sinusoidal variation consistent with a nearly circular orbit of a planetary companion .",
    "the lack of any discontinuities in the phased velocity plot argues against a background eclipsing binary star as the explanation .",
    "such a binary with a period of 0.83 d would have orbital semi - amplitudes of hundreds of kilometers per sec , so large that the spectral lines would completely separate from each other , and separate from the lines of the main star .",
    "such breaks in the spectral - line blends would cause discontinuities in the velocity variation , which is not seen here .",
    "thus , the chance that the 0.83 d periodicity exhibited independently in both the photometry and velocities might be caused by an eclipsing binary seems quite remote .",
    "precision doppler measurements are used to constrain the mass of koi-72.01  ( kepler-10b ) as discussed in section  [ sec : planet ] .",
    "the absence of a doppler signal for koi-72.02  is used to compute an upper limit to the mass of this candidate under the planet interpretation .      from the keck spectra",
    ", we computed a mean line profile and the corresponding mean line bisector .",
    "time - varying line asymmetries are tracked by measuring the bisector spans  the velocity difference between the top and bottom of the mean line bisector  for each spectrum @xcite .",
    "when rv variations are the result of a blended spectrum between a star and an eclipsing binary , we expect the bisectors to reveal a phase - modulated line asymmetry @xcite . in the case of kepler-10b",
    ", there is no evidence for a correlation between the bisector spans and the rvs which would otherwise argue against the planetary interpretation ( see figure  [ fig : bisector ] ) , and similarly for the 45-day signal of koi-72.02 .",
    "however , we note that the uncertainties in the bisector span measurements are quite large so that the rms variation of the bisector spans ( 10.5 @xmath102 ) exceeds the semi - amplitude of the rv variation ( @xmath110 @xmath102 ) .",
    "therefore , we do not consider the bisector span measurements to be discriminating in this case .",
    "in this section we examine the possibility that the transit signals seen in the _ kepler _  photometry of kepler-10  are the result of contamination of the light of the target by an eclipsing binary along the same line of sight ( ` blend ' ) .",
    "we consider as potential false positives physically associated hierarchical triple systems as well as chance alignments ( eclipsing binary in the background or foreground ) .",
    "we make use of the technique referred to as blender , described recently by @xcite , which we apply separately to each of the signals in kepler-10  since each could be due in principle to a separate blend .",
    "briefly , this technique compares in a @xmath111 sense the observed light curve to a synthetic light curve resulting from brightness variations of an eclipsing binary being attenuated by the ( typically ) brighter star kepler-10 .",
    "the parameters of the eclipsing binary are varied over wide ranges to find all viable blend scenarios producing a good match to the observations .",
    "the properties of each component of the binary ( referred to here as the ` secondary ' and ` tertiary ' ) are taken from model isochrones @xcite , and those of the main star ( the ` primary ' ) are constrained by the spectroscopic analysis described earlier . for the technical details of blender  we refer the reader to the previously cited work , as well as @xcite .",
    "given the short period of this signal , we may assume that tidal forces have circularized the orbits of any potential eclipsing binary contaminants @xcite .",
    "we considered first the case of a hierarchical triple system .",
    "simulations with blender  clearly indicate that such systems in which the eclipsing binary is composed of two stars provide poor fits to the _ kepler _  light curve .",
    "we thus rule out this type of blend scenario .",
    "if the eclipsing binary is composed of a planet ( i.e. , a smaller tertiary ) transiting a star , rather than two stars eclipsing each other , then it is possible to reproduce the measured light curve , but only if the secondary has very nearly the same brightness as the target star itself . in that case",
    "the resulting size of the tertiary is @xmath112 larger than in a model of a single star transited by a planet .",
    "however , such a bright contaminant would have been evident in our spectroscopy as a second set of lines , and this case is therefore also excluded .",
    "we next examined the background eclipsing binary scenario , allowing the relative distance between the binary and the main star to vary over a wide range .",
    "we accounted for absorption from dust along the line of sight as described by @xcite , adopting a representative coefficient of differential extinction of @xmath113  mag  kpc@xmath35 .",
    "interestingly , we found that no combination of relative distance and stellar properties for the eclipsing binary ( composed in this case of two stars ) gives an acceptable fit to the light curve .",
    "the reason is that all such blend configurations lead to out - of - eclipse brightness changes ( ellipsoidal variations ) with an amplitude so large as to be ruled out by the data .",
    "thus , background blends of this kind can be confidently ruled out .",
    "this result is significant , because it reduces the overall likelihood of blends for koi-72.01   considerably , as we describe below .",
    "if we allow the tertiary in the eclipsing pair to be a planet instead of a star ( i.e. , an object of smaller radius ) , then we do find a range of blend scenarios that lead to acceptable fits to the light curve , which can not be ruled out a priori .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : blender1 ] , in which we show contours of equal goodness of fit of the light curve compared to a standard transit model fit .",
    "blender  indicates that these false positives can be up to about 5 magnitudes fainter than the primary in the _ kepler _  band , and that in all cases the secondary star is close in spectral type ( and mass , or color ) to the primary , or slightly earlier . of these blends",
    ", we can further rule out those with secondaries having @xmath114 , which are bright enough that they would have been detected spectroscopically .",
    "this implicitly places a lower bound also on the size of the tertiaries ( @xmath363.8@xmath16 ) , as tertiaries smaller than this limit only give good matches to the light curve if the contaminating star - planet pair is not too far behind the primary , and is therefore relatively bright .",
    "also excludes white dwarfs as possible tertiaries .",
    "additionally , such massive objects in a tight 0.84-day orbit would lead to very significant ellipsoidal variation due to tidal distortions induced on the primary star , which are not seen . ] those cases would be ruled out spectroscopically , as mentioned before .",
    "the remaining blends shown in the figure above the line with @xmath115 must be addressed statistically .    for this",
    "we followed closely the methodology applied by @xcite for the case of kepler-9d .",
    "we computed the mean density of stars ( i.e. , background contaminants ) in the appropriate mass range based on figure  [ fig : blender1 ] in half - magnitude bins , using the besanon galactic structure models of @xcite , and we calculated the fraction of these stars that would remain undetected after our high - resolution imaging observations described earlier ( the constraints from centroid motion analysis are less stringent ; see figure  [ fig : ao ] )",
    ". some of these stars might be orbited by ( transiting ) planets , constituting potential blends . to estimate how many of these cases one would expect",
    ", we adopted the same frequencies of transiting jupiters and transiting neptunes as in @xcite , based on the results of @xcite , adjusted in the case of the neptune - size planets to account for the lower limit of @xmath363.8@xmath16 allowed by blender  for the tertiaries .",
    "the outcome of these calculations is presented in table  [ tab : statistics1 ] .",
    "the total frequency of false positives ( blend frequency , bf ) we expect to find _ a priori _ for koi-72.01   is @xmath116 . translating this into a probability statement for the planet likelihood is difficult , as argued by @xcite , because it requires knowledge of the rate of occurrence of super - earth - size planets , a quantity that is not yet in hand .",
    "nevertheless , following those authors we may express the false alarm rate for a random candidate star in the _ kepler _  field generally as @xmath117 , in which @xmath118 is the number of false positives and @xmath119 is the unknown number of planets in the sample .",
    "the number of false positives may be taken to be @xmath120 , the product of the blend frequency for koi-72.01  and the total number of _ kepler _  targets @xcite .    if we were to accept a confidence level of 3@xmath58 ( 99.73% ) as sufficient for validation of a transiting planet candidate ( corresponding to @xmath121 ) , then the minimum number of super - earth - size planets required in order to be able to claim this level of confidence happens to be @xmath122 , according to the expression above .",
    "this value is so small that it gives us high confidence that the koi-72.01  signal is not a false positive , but instead corresponds to a bona - fide super - earth - size planet . another way to view",
    "this is that the expected number of background stars capable of producing the observed signal is @xmath123 ( see table  [ tab : statistics1 ] , bottom of column 5 ) , so the probability that what we are seeing is a background blend is @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the a priori probabilities that giant planets and super - earths occur with short - period orbits .",
    "thus , claiming a far corresponding to a 3-@xmath58 detection only requires that the aforementioned probability ratio does not exceed 300 .",
    "it is worth noting that the arguments above allow us to validate koi-72.01  _ independently _ of the detection of the reflex motion of the star ( rv ) .",
    "this is possible in this case because we are able to rule out , using blender , all false positives in which the background eclipsing binary is composed of two stars , which are predicted to induce ellipsoidal variation at a level that is not present in the photometry .",
    "were this not the case , the blend frequency bf would have come out considerably larger , requiring in turn a significantly higher value for @xmath119 .",
    "a similar blender  analysis was performed for koi-72.02 . for circular orbits ,",
    "hierarchical triple systems are ruled out for the same reasons as in koi-72.01 .",
    "when considering the case of background eclipsing binaries ( stellar tertiaries ) with circular orbits , we find a range of blend scenarios that provide acceptable fits to the light curve , with secondaries of similar spectral type as the primary .",
    "unlike the situation for koi-72.01 , the longer period of koi-72.02(45.3 days ) leads to negligible ellipsoidal variation for the contaminating binaries , and this does not allow these types of blends to be excluded based on the quality of the fit , as we were able to do before .",
    "chance alignment scenarios in which the tertiaries are planets rather than stars also lead to viable blends that can be up to 4 mag fainter than the target .",
    "those that are brighter than @xmath127 can be ruled out because they would have produced a spectroscopic signature , but fainter ones can not be ruled out any other way if they are angularly close enough to the target to be unresolved by our imaging observations .",
    "however , the longer period of this signal does not justify the assumption of a circular orbit . allowing the orbit of a contaminating binary to have arbitrary eccentricity and also arbitrary orientation ( longitude of periastron )",
    "can significantly increase the range of blends that provide good matches to the _ kepler _  photometry , both for the chance alignment case and for physically associated triples .",
    "this is because the orbital speed in an eccentric orbit can be considerably larger or smaller than in a circular orbit , allowing for blends involving smaller or larger secondaries than would otherwise be permitted while still matching the observed duration of the transits , as described by @xcite .",
    "it also increases the complexity of the problem , as the space of parameters to be explored is much larger .",
    "additionally , because the secondaries are now not necessarily of the same spectral type as the primary star , attention must be paid to the resulting color of these blends , which could be different from the measured colors as reported in the _ kepler _  input catalog @xcite , in which case the blend would be excluded . because these complications require significantly more effort to address , we are unable to provide sufficient evidence for the planetary nature of the koi-72.02  signal at this time based on blender  considerations alone , and we defer such a study to a forthcoming publication .",
    "we note , however , that the transit duration and period of the two transit signals identified in the light curve give the same stellar density ( @xmath128 g @xmath18 for koi-72.01  versus @xmath129 g @xmath18 for koi-72.02 ) as derived from the transit properties using the analytic expression given in equation 9 of @xcite .",
    "this is a rare coincidence for a blend configuration .",
    "we carried out an lte spectroscopic analysis using the spectral synthesis package sme @xcite applied to a high resolution template spectrum from keck - hires of kepler-10  to derive an effective temperature , @xmath130 k , surface gravity , @xmath131 ( cgs ) , metallicity , @xmath86}= { \\ensuremath{-0.15 \\pm 0.03}}$ ] , @xmath132 @xmath87 , and the associated error distribution for each of them . to refine the true parameters of the star",
    ", we took a novel path to constrain its surface gravity .",
    "the above effective temperature was used to constrain the fundamental stellar parameters derived via asteroseismic analysis ( see section  [ sec : astero ] ) .",
    "the asteroseismology analysis gave @xmath133 which is 0.2 dex lower than the sme value .",
    "the asteroseismology value is likely superior because of the high sensitivity of the acoustic periods to stellar radius .",
    "still , the asteroseismology result depended on adopting the value of @xmath134 from sme .",
    "we recomputed the sme analysis by freezing ( adopting ) the seismology value for @xmath135 .",
    "this iteration yielded values of @xmath136 k , @xmath86}= { \\ensuremath{-0.15 \\pm 0.04}}$ ] , and rotational @xmath137 . the revised effective temperature was then put back into the asteroseismology calculation to further constrain the stellar radius and gravity .",
    "this iterative process converged quickly , as the @xmath83  from seismology yielded an sme value for @xmath82  that was only slightly different from the original unconstrained determination .",
    "we also measured the ca ii h&k emission @xcite , yielding a mt .",

    "this is consistent with the age derived from the asteroseismology analysis ( section  [ sec : astero ] ) .      with a magnitude in the _ kepler _  bandpass of kp@xmath30 , kepler-10  presented itself as a promising case for asteroseismic characterization and was , consequently , placed on the short - cadence target list before it was even identified as a planet candidate .",

    "a jupiter - size planet ( @xmath218 transit depth ) in a 1-week orbit would produce a ratio about 100 times larger .",
    "the transit timing variations ( ttv ) from a nonresonant perturbing planet are essentially independent of the mass of the transiting planet . to summarize , additional non - transiting planets orbiting kepler-10  are not well constrained by the measured transit times of kepler-10b .",
    "here our rv measurements , which have very good precision of approximately 2.6 @xmath102 , are better suited to detect additional , nontransiting planets in this system .",

    "figure [ fig : ttvfig ] shows the maximum allowed mass of a perturbing planet in an orbit near kepler-10b  including both the transit time and rv data .",
    "near mean - motion resonance , small planets with masses below that of mars can be excluded .",
    "away from resonance , the rv data constrain the presence of additional planets to be less than a few earth masses .",
    "if koi-72.02  is , indeed , a longer - period planet orbiting kepler-10 , a ttv signal due to the interaction with kepler-10b  must exist at some level and it behooves us to consider the expected magnitude of such a signal and whether or not it would be detectable in the data at hand .",
    "the hierarchical architecture limits the mechanisms that are capable of inducing a detectable signal .",
    "neither changes in the light travel time caused by the displacement of the star due to a hypothetical outer planet , nor an evolving tidal field caused by an eccentric outer planet ( see section 4 of @xcite ) , would be detectable in this system given the measured timing uncertainties .",
    "this statement is true even when one accounts for the factor of @xmath219 ( where @xmath220 is the number of observed transits ) statistical improvement in the sensitivity .",
    "a scenario with an outer planet having a large eccentricity would only produce a detectable signal if its mass is comparable to jupiter and its eccentricity is greater than 0.95 ( see equation ( 25 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the absence of a ttv signal in the data does not rule out the planetary interpretation of koi-72.02 , given the upper mass limit of 20 @xmath14  ( section  [ sec : planet ] ) .",

    "indeed , it lies between the models of ice giants similar to neptune and uranus and the models of a 50% water planet . and",
    "while the @xcite mass and radius point to a rocky composition , the lower mass of @xcite marginally favors a water / ice composition .",
    "the properties of kepler-10b  together with their uncertainties clearly indicate a high - density , rocky planet .",
    "the dotted curve at the bottom of figure  [ fig : massradius ] is the envelope corresponding to a maximum fe core fraction expected from simulations of mantle stripping by giant impacts @xcite .",
    "these simulations and planet formation scenarios indicate that pure fe core objects can not form in the mass range we consider . at the mass of kepler-10b",
    "these simulations predict that the maximum attainable fe core is about 75% by mass . for comparison",

    "there is consensus in the literature @xcite regarding the general results .",
    "however , the theoretical uncertainties are compounded by a degeneracy between only 2 observables ( radius and mass ) , and 3 or 4 distinct types of bulk materials : fe core , mantle ( silicates , etc . ) , water , and hydrogen / helium gas ( see @xcite for details ) .    at very high densities the radius of solid planets",
    "is constrained by the lack of bulk materials with density and compression properties above that of fe and fe alloys ( see lower - envelope dotted curve in figure  [ fig : massradius ] ) .",
    "planets with high densities close to that envelope are likely composed predominantly of silicates and fe ; the degeneracy is lifted as indicated by the curvature of the iso - radius curves when they approach asymptotically the `` dry '' right - hand side of the ternary diagram in figure  [ fig : ternary ] .",
    "ternary diagrams were introduced to studies of solid planet structure by @xcite .",
    "the three axes of the ternary diagram represent the core , mantle , and ice fraction of a planet of a given mass ( in this case , the mass derived for kepler-10b ) .",
    "the axes are read by following lines parallel to the edges so that the three mass fractions sum to unity .",
    "although there are 6 radiants emerging from each point in the grid , only three will result in mass fractions that add to unity .",
    "different combinations of core , mantle , and ice fraction yield a planet radius that can be computed with theoretical models constrained by a given mass .",
    "radius is not unique to a specific combination of mass fractions .",

    "it shows the possible combinations that all yield the derived radius of kepler-10b .",
    "the dotted lines provide bounds on the domain captured by the one - sigma errors in planet radius .",

    "the iso - radius together with the one - sigma error bars are a good representation of the possible bulk compositions for a given planet .",
    "the degeneracy in bulk composition discussed above is best illustrated in figure  [ fig : ternary ] , as a planet defined by a mass and radius is represented by a curve ( solid ) that can span a range of iron : mantle : water fractions .",
    "this degeneracy is practically lifted only for very high density planets near the `` dry '' right - hand side , close to the 100% iron core vertex , because : ( 1 ) the iso - radius curves bend as they approach the 0% water level , and ( 2 ) the h@xmath29o and oh molecules are able to be incorporated inside high - pressure silicate phases without changing their eos much .",
    "for kepler-10b , the combination of very high density and constraints from mantle - stripping simulations ( dash - dot line ) , restrict its bulk compositions to dry rocky iron - core - dominated interiors similar to mercury . on the other hand , if the observational derivation of the mass of kepler-10b  were significantly overestimated ( by more than 1-sigma )",
    ", the planet could contain significant amount of water in its interior .    in conclusion , within 1-to-2-sigma in its derived radius and mass ,",
    "the planet kepler-10b  is a dry rocky planet with high fe content .",
    "its high density does not violate the prediction for maximum mantle stripping during planet formation @xcite .",
    "the phase curve amplitude of kepler-10b  is @xmath215 ppm ( see table  [ tab : systemparams ] ) .",
    "if due to scattered light alone , this corresponds to a _ kepler _",
    "bandpass effective geometric albedo of 0.68 .",
    "the occultation depth is @xmath216 ppm which corresponds to an effective geometric albedo of @xmath225 .",
    "this is an unusually high albedo .",
    "the only known solar system bodies that are so bright are venus ( due to photochemically induced hazes ) and saturn s icy moon enceladus ( coated with fresh ice ) .",
    "kepler-10b  is likely too hot for any hazes and is certainly too hot for any ice .",
    "another possibility is that kepler-10b  has silicate clouds , but they would have to be completely covering the planet s day side and have a large particle size in order to provide the required reflectivity ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we prefer an interpretation that the phase curve is dominated by a thermal radiation change from the planet s day to night side",
    ". this case would be reminiscent of hot jupiters , which have a hotter day side than night side . in the case of the _ kepler _  bandpass , the temperature difference need not be too extreme , as long as the planet is hot enough on the day side ( as is the case for kepler-10b  with a equilibrium temperature of @xmath226 k ) .",
    "this is because the _ kepler _  bandpass is in the optical , and so the contribution of thermal radiation drops off rapidly with decreasing temperature ( i.e. day - to - night side ) .",
    "in other words , a passband on the wien side of the black body curve will capture significantly different fluxes with just a small change in temperature .",
    "an example of this is the phase curve of hat - p-7 @xcite .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that kepler-10b  has no atmosphere at all , having lost it over time due to atmospheric erosion .",
    "one test is to search for a hotspot directly at the substellar point , since no atmospheric winds would be available to move the hotspot off center @xcite .",
    "further _ kepler _  data , in particular a confirmation and robust measurement of the occultation depth , of kepler-10b  will help with any interpretation .",
    "asteroseismic measurements of the host star kepler-10  indicate that the planetary system is very old , allowing for more than 11 gyr of evaporation and mass loss from the surface of kepler-10b .",
    "assuming , as is common , that the planet arrived at its present orbit within about 100 myr of formation , the relevant evaporation time scales are those of water steam or a silicate surface .",
    "any h / he envelope would have evaporated too quickly ( at @xmath224 10@xmath227 g s@xmath35 ) to affect the further evolution of the planet , while the evaporation of the silicate mantle is too slow to remove more than 50% of the planet s original mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to establish if kepler-10b  is the remnant core of a water planet or an ice giant planet , though it is probable that it must have lost a significant fraction of its mass .",
