    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) has been successfully used in calculating core polarisation / relaxation effects in a variety of properties @xcite .",

    "however , its connection with mbpt and cct has not been explored in detail to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we focus on this particular point in this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first derive an effective operator in mbpt for electric dipole ( @xmath0 ) transition amplitudes for allowed and forbidden transitions induced by the parity non conserving ( pnc ) neutral current weak interaction @xcite . from the general expression in mbpt , we consider diagrammatically all the rpa diagrams pertaining to zeroth and first order in the residual coulomb interaction .",
    "this is followed by theoretical understanding of these effects starting from hartree fock ( hf ) equations to show how these effects can be represented as linear equations which in turn can be solved to self - consistency taking the residual coulomb interaction to all orders . at the end , starting from the basic formalism for cc method , we compare the rpa diagrams both theoretically and numerically with the corresponding diagrams in cct .",
    "in perturbation theory , the functional space for the wave function is separated into two parts ; a model space ( p ) and an orthogonal space ( q ) .",
    "the basic idea of such a division is to find an effective operator which act only within the limited model space but which generate the same result as do the original operators acting on the entire functional space . here in the sections which follow ,",
    "we derive an effective operator for allowed and pnc induced e1 transitions using perturbation theory .",
    "we start the derivation with the total hamiltonian as h = h_0 + v_es where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the unperturbed one - electron and perturbed two - electron operators . if @xmath3 is the atomic state function ( asf ) , then it satisfies the equation , h_0|_0=e_0|_0 . where @xmath4 is the energy eigenvalue of the asf . here",
    "we are interested in allowed @xmath0 dipole transitions between the eigen states of the atomic hamiltonian @xmath5 as given by e1 = _",

    "the above equation describes the first order rpa effect as it involves the excitation of the core orbital ` a ' to a virtual orbital ` q ' through the residual coulomb interaction .",

    "( 5b ) , the sense of the core and particle is different from the accepted convention with respect to d vertex and hence it is called a pseudo diagram . whereas in the second case , by taking the negative sign inside the expression for @xmath53 , fig .",
    "( 5c ) can be interpreted by local energy denominator for both d and coulomb vertex .    comparing the above terms with all the first order mbpt terms",

    "similar to the allowed @xmath0 transition , in the case of pnc , the influence of @xmath29 as a perturbation can be treated in the framework of rpa . in the next section",
    ", we show the basic formulation for cc method and show how rpa terms arises in the above mentioned method .",
    "we have so far been discussing about perturbation theory in which some of the terms of the perturbation theory were grouped together and evaluated to all orders .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the coupled cluster method where a particular class of mbpt diagrams is calculated to all orders in the residual coulomb interaction .",
    "the many - electron wave function in cc method is given by    reference state and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the cluster operators which considers excitations from core and valence to virtual orbitals .",

    "we now consider cc diagrams corresponding to the rpa effects . in cc theory for allowed and pnc perturbed dipole transitions , we consider @xmath8 as an operator .",
    "the coulomb operator acts as a perturbation for the allowed transitions , whereas for the pnc induced @xmath0 transitions , we have pnc perturbation in addition to it .",
    "therefore we need to first find out from which side of the dipole operator the perturbations act .    the diagrams for the allowed @xmath0 transition amplitude in the framework of cc theory has been discussed in one of our earlier papers @xcite .",

    "we find that pnc acting on the same vertex as coulomb operator , leads to the regular diagram and pnc and the residual coulomb interaction on the initial and final vertices leads to the additional pseudo / local energy diagram .",
