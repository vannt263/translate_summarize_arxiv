    "finding models for calculations of lifetime probability of systems evolving in accordance to well - defined rules seems to be a very attractive problem @xcite not only in physics but also in many other fields of sciences .",
    "the system evolution is usually controlled by stochastic transformations of components which are called in the sequel `` particles '' . in the present model the transformation",
    "is realized by autocatalytic reactions which play important role in organization and coordination of systems having small spatial volume and containing few particles only .    in this paper",
    "we are dealing with small systems which are in living state when the number of autocatalytic particles remains within the interval @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is a positive integer , while the number of substrate particles is kept constant by a suitable reservoir .",
    "one can say that both the absence and the large `` dose '' of @xmath6 particles lead to the extinction of the system .",
    "we would like to determine the lifetime probability of such systems .",
