    "in recent years there has been growing interest in the spectral theory of higher order elliptic operators .",
    "however , in contrast to the well - understood theory for second order operators , the higher order theory can be quite different and is certainly less well developed .",
    "the recent survey article @xcite contains an account of many of the key results .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore , using reliable and accurate numerical techniques , some of the properties of the eigenfunctions of the biharmonic operator on domains in @xmath0 .",
    "in particular we investigate the existence of so - called _ nodal lines _ in the neighbourhood of certain corners of the domain and also how the parity of these eigenfunctions may change with domain geometry . as will become clear from the quantitative description of these problems below this",
    "is a demanding computational task since very high numerical accuracy is required in order to resolve the phenomena under investigation .",
    "the biharmonic eigenvalue problem typically comes in two different forms : the clamped plate eigenproblem @xmath1 and the buckling plate eigenproblem @xmath2 each on a domain @xmath3 subject to appropriate conditions on the boundary @xmath4 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall consider only the zero dirichlet conditions @xmath5    in the remainder of this introductory section we describe details of the specific problems that are to be considered .",
    "section [ s:2 ] then contains an outline and justification of the numerical techniques , based upon the use of conforming @xmath6 finite elements , that are used to undertake these investigations .",
    "this is followed in sections [ s:3 ] and [ s:4 ] respectively by our findings concerning oscillations of the eigenfunctions in the neighbourhood of corners of the domain and the dependence of the parity of the eigenfunctions on the domain geometry .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief discussion of our results along with a consideration of the issues associated with the validation of numerical simulations such as these , including mesh convergence and the use of rigorous enclosure  techniques .      for each of the two problems ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) it is shown in @xcite,@xcite that in the neighbourhood of a corner of @xmath4 with sufficiently small internal angle @xmath7 any eigenfunction changes sign an infinite number of times .",
    "moreover the ratio of the distance from the corner , along its bisector , of consecutive zeros of the eigenfunction tends to a limit which is dependent upon @xmath7 .",
    "it transpires that this ratio is an increasing function of @xmath7 and is such that the oscillations cease to be present when the internal angle exceeds some critical value @xmath8 .",
    "these results are special cases of more general theorems concerning higher order elliptic operators in greater than one dimension @xcite .",
    "their derivation is based upon an asymptotic expansion of the eigenfunction , @xmath9 , centred at , and in a neighbourhood of , the corner .",
    "the leading term of such an expansion as one approaches the corner along the bisector of the angle ( which we always do ) is of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance from the corner , and @xmath12 is a solution of the transcendental equation @xmath13 assuming that the coefficient @xmath14 is non - zero the relevant solution is the one with smallest real part . from this equation , which has only real solutions for @xmath15 , it may be concluded that when the internal angle is greater than @xmath8 the eigenfunction has no sign changes near the corner .",
    "conversely as @xmath16 both the real and imaginary parts of the exponent of the leading term in the asymptotic expansion grow unboundedly , implying that the eigenfunction oscillates with high frequency but is damped out quickly for small @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , when we let @xmath17 be the distance along the bisector from the corner to the @xmath18 zero of @xmath9 , where @xmath19 increases with decreasing distance from the corner , then it follows immediately from the asymptotic expression that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the solution of ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) with smallest real part .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath22 is the distance along the bisector to the @xmath18 extremum of @xmath9 and @xmath23 is the magnitude of this extremum , it may also be shown that @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "the first goal of this research is to verify this behaviour for a sequence of domains which take the form of sectors of a circle with increasing arc length . in view of the above discussion and the data in table  [ t0 ] below it is clear that such a verification will require very high accuracy from the numerical methods used .",
    "this table presents the solutions @xmath26 of ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) as a function of @xmath7 , as well as the ratios @xmath27 and @xmath28 which appear in ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) .",
    "these solutions of ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) are obtained by newton s method with double precision arithmetic .",
    ".the solutions of ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) as a function of the angle @xmath7 .",
    "the ratios @xmath27 and @xmath28 are also given .",
    "[ t0 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ t:4.1 ] clearly shows that , for our finite element discretization at least , there are indeed values of @xmath14 for which the branches of the two smallest eigenvalues cross . inspection of the corresponding eigenfunctions demonstrates that one of these functions is always even and the other is always odd : we refer to the associated eigenvalues as @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "further numerical computations on a sequence of coarser grids , @xcite , suggest that as the mesh size @xmath31 is reduced , the locations of these crossing points remain stable and the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not tend to zero for values of @xmath14 between these points .",
    "this suggests that it is reasonably safe for us to conclude that the parity of the eigenfunction corresponding to the least eigenvalue of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) does indeed change as the domain @xmath32 evolves .",
    "although we have only presented results for the clamped plate problem here , it is shown in @xcite that similar behaviour may be observed for the buckling plate problem ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) on these domains .",
    "it is interesting to hypothesize on the behaviour of the eigenvalue branches as @xmath14 gets very close to its limiting value of zero .",
    "the resolution of the computations that we have undertaken only appears to allow us to identify the first two or three values of @xmath14 for which the least eigenvalue is repeated . beyond this point discretization and rounding errors",
    "make it impossible to distinguish between them , even though they are almost certainly different for most values of @xmath33",
    ". there may however be further values of @xmath14 , smaller than those that we have been able to identify , for which @xmath34 : we conjecture that there are an infinite number of such values .",
    "in this paper our aim has been to demonstrate that the finite element method may be successfully applied to biharmonic eigenvalue problems of the form ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) , and that it may be used both to verify existing asymptotic results and to allow new conjectures to be made about the behaviour of their eigenfunctions . an outline of the finite element implementation is given in section [ s:2 ] , with complete details available in @xcite .",
    "verification of the accuracy of this approach is provided by comparison with known analytical results applied on a unit square domain , along with the recent high precision numerical results ( calculated using an entirely different discretization scheme ) that appear in @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the mixed finite element method used in this work is that it may easily be applied on unstructured grids of triangles , @xmath35 , and therefore on arbitrary polygonal domains in @xmath0 .",
    "we have made use of this fact to investigate the spectral properties of the biharmonic operator on two further geometries : sectors of the unit circle and a family of non - convex domains .",
    "furthermore it is possible to generate meshes for which the degrees of freedom in the corresponding piecewise cubic trial spaces are not uniformly distributed throughout @xmath36 . where appropriate ,",
    "this allows us to obtain a greater resolution of the eigenfunctions in those regions in which we wish to focus , without affecting either the dimension or the sparsity of the discrete linear system ( [ e2.7 ] ) .",
    "the results presented in section [ s:3 ] are in agreement with the asymptotic theory that appears in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and also provide quantitative estimates of the positions of a number of sign changes and extremal points for various values of the internal angle @xmath7 . in section [ s:4 ]",
    "we extend the numerical investigation further by considering a family of problems for which the eigenfunctions have significantly different qualitative properties .",
    "this has led to evidence that , unlike the laplace operator , the parity of the least eigenfunction of the biharmonic operator can change as the domain is deformed .    the unstructured finite element approach that we have used in this work may also be applied to further problems in this area .",
    "clearly it is possible to investigate the spectral properties of the biharmonic operator on a greater variety of geometries in 2-d , and subject to a wider variety of boundary conditions .",
    "this would include , for example , further studies in the circular sector domains for very small angles @xmath7 .",
    "perhaps more interestingly however ( and certainly more computationally demanding ) would be extensions to higher order operators and/or larger numbers of dimensions .",
    "we conclude this paper by noting that none of the computational results that are presented here provide _ rigorous _",
    "information about the eigenfunctions considered ( although the apparent mesh convergence observed is certainly a strong indicator ) .",
    "it would be interesting therefore to attempt to obtain provably correct bounds for certain quantities associated with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the biharmonic operator on the regions considered . in @xcite , for example , weiners",
    "has made a start on this problem by computing enclosures for the first eigenfunction in the neighbourhood of a corner of the unit square .",
    "this involves computing estimates for the sobolev embedding constants which in turn requires an upper bound for the defect of the eigenfunction .",
    "he is able to show that the defect is less than @xmath37 which is sufficiently accurate to allow him to conclude that the first eigenfunction changes sign",
    ". since the estimates of the amplitude of the second and higher sign changes that we have found are considerably smaller than for the first , new methods are likely to be required in order to compute the defect with sufficient precision .",
