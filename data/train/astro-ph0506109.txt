    "evidence for a link between intense star formation and nuclear activity has grown steadily in recent years ( e.g. veilleux , 2001 , gonzales delgado et al . 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "on one hand , the presence of circumnuclear starbursts in many local agns ( e.g. , levenson et al .",
    "2004 , levenson et al .",
    "2001 ) suggests a connection not yet fully understood .",
    "the presence of a starburst has been invoked for instance to produce absorption in low luminosity agns ( fabian et al .",
    "1998 , ohsuga & umemura , 2001 ) . on the other hand , the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of normal galaxies ( kormendy et al . 2002 ) and the proportionality between the black hole and the spheroidal masses ( ferrarese & merrit 2000 ) evidence a direct link between the formation of ellipticals and spiral bulges and the growth of central black holes . therefore ,",
    "the interplay between accretion on supermassive black holes and galaxy formation and evolution has become a fundamental ingredient for theoretical models in this field ( e.g. , springel et al .",
    "2005 , sazonov et al",
    ". 2005 , nipoti et al .",
    "this implies that our view on the star formation history of the universe , as deduced by galaxy luminosity functions ( see springel et al . 2005 ) , as well as on the chemical enrichment and feedback processes in the early universe , might change in a way that we can not foresee at this moment .",
    "understanding the connection between starburst and agn in the local universe is therefore of crucial importance .    a spectroscopic optical survey of bright iras and x - ray selected sources from the rosat all sky survey revealed a small enigmatic class of low redshift galaxies with optical spectra dominated by the features of h  ii galaxies but presenting very subtle seyfert signatures as well .",
    "these objects had x - ray luminosities typical of broad line agns , ranging from 1.5 @xmath4 10@xmath6 erg / s to 5 @xmath4 10@xmath7 erg / s in the rosat band ( moran et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter m96 ) .",
    "they were named composite after their composite optical spectra .",
    "the diagnostic emission line ratio diagrams ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) classify them either on the boundary between seyfert and hii regions or as pure star - forming galaxies .",
    "most of these galaxies show quite narrow emission lines ( fwhm@xmath8300 km / s ) as hii galaxies normally do . yet , some of them present [ o  iii]@xmath9@xmath94959,5007 lines significantly broader than all other narrow lines in the spectrum and weak and elusive broad h@xmath0 wings . a possible scenario to explain the optical and x - ray mismatch proposed by m96 invokes absorption as responsible for the obscuration of the optical features .",
    "m96 also suggested that it is not likely that the starburst could overpower a seyfert optical nuclear spectrum , given that the starburst component in these objects is not particularly strong . on the contrary here we propose that the agn and the starburst components in these objects are present at the same level of activity making them ideal laboratories in which the two phenomena can be studied together .    until recently little or no information in the x - ray spectral domain were available for the m96 sample of composite galaxies except for the rosat data . in the last couple of years ,",

    "we do not detect any off - nuclear source within the optical extent of iras01072 + 4954 ( at the given exposure the flux limit corresponds to a luminosity of 2.5@xmath410@xmath23 erg / s ) .",

    "these sources contribute at most 15% of the nuclear flux , so that it is unlikely that they could have been dominant in the rosat observations .    in order to look for extended emission ,",
    "the radial profile of each source has been derived in annular regions centered on the nuclear position and reaching out to 5@xmath21 , where the signal fades into the background .",
    "we also obtained a radial profile for the _ chandra _ psf , by using the ciao task _ chart _ , which simulates , by ray - tracing , a source with the same spectrum as the target and an exposure time appropriate to derive the statistics needed to define the psf shape with virtually no errors ( we choose 100 ks ) .",

    "they are a powerful tool in the detection of heavy obscuration not seen in x - rays below 10 kev ( as in compton thick objects , bassani et al .",
    "clearly composite objects all fall in the agn region , in good agreement with the relative broadness of the [ o  iii]@xmath95007 line found by m96 which points to an agn origin .",
    "the diagram further shows that they should all be classified as compton thin agn ( note that the x - ray fluxes used in the plot are those observed in the ` low - state ' epoch , and therefore the classification would be also valid in the high - state ) .",
    "this indicates very little amount of absorption , in agreement with the results obtained from the x - ray analysis , i.e. the absence of a strong fe - line and x - ray obscuration .",
    "therefore the relative weakness of the agn optical emission lines can not be explained as due to the presence of absorbing material in the line of sight , as suggested by m96 .",
    "having assessed the importance of the agn component from the x - ray , infrared and [ o  iii ] emissions combined , we want to estimate here the amount of x - ray emission expected to be produced by the presence of a starburst .",
    "therefore we derived the star formation rate ( sfr ) from the far - infrared luminosity ( kennicutt 1998 ) , assuming that the latter ( given in table  [ sample ] ) is all due to the starburst .",

    "observed x - ray emission in excess to that predicted from sfr has also been observed in high - redshift submillimeter sources ( alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) , that might point to the presence of an active nucleus also for this class of objects . only in the case of iras00317@xmath102142 the observed x - ray luminosity is close to the expected value for a starburst ; this is in agreement with the results of the multi - wavelength analysis for this object presented in the next section .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have been assembled from radio ( @xmath57 hz ) to hard x - rays ( @xmath58 hz ) for our sample sources .",
    "radio , far to near infrared , optical , x - ray data have been taken from ned , and complemented with the _ chandra _ data from this work .",
    "all x - ray data points have been plotted with the spectral shape measured in the _ chandra _ observations .    in figure  [ sed1 ]",
    "we compare the observed seds with the templates of medium energy distribution for radio quiet quasars ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , starburst galaxies ( schmitt et al .",
    "1997 ) and normal spiral galaxies ( elvis et al .",
    "the templates we show are normalized to match , and not exceed data points .",
    "in particular , the starburst template is normalized to the radio - ir portion of the spectrum , while the x - ray one is normalized to the different x - ray states observed .",
    "we stress that we are only interested in deriving an overall consistent picture , without attempting a quantitative computation of the contributions of the different components , that would require at least simultaneous data to account for the observed variability in the x - ray band .",
    "moreover , it must be taken into account that all data points have been taken using different apertures , in particular for the optical band where the emission is heavily contaminated by the host galaxy .",
    "the seds show clearly the _ composite _ nature of these objects : the agn dominates at x - ray wavelengths , while the starburst is the most important contributor to the mid@xmath59far ir emission ; the host galaxy template accounts for the optical appearance .",
    "it is evident that , in the optical band , the agn contribution is always less than that of the starburst , and , except for a couple of sources during their `` high '' state , even by a factor of 10 .",
    "note instead that in iras00317@xmath102142 , when it is in the low state , the contributions to the x - ray emission from the agn and the starburst become comparable ( in agreement with figure  [ sfr ] ) .",
    "the agn contributes to the total bolometric luminosity from less than 10% in the low flux state , to 15 - 30% in the high flux state thus making the sb contribution dominant in the bolometric output , except possibly during bright agn flares .",
    "mid - infrared and l - band spectroscopy could provide a powerful way to disentangle the starburst from the agn component ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 , imanishi 2002 , risaliti et al .",
    "2003 , lutz et al . 2003 ) .",
    "moreover broad band data from the near to the far - infrared frequencies could provide a more detailed characterization of the seds , in particular by exploiting the spitzer space telescope unprecedented capabilities ( see e.g. franceschini et al . 2005 ) .",
    "iras00317@xmath102142 , iras20051@xmath101117 and iras20069@xmath615929 are the only three sources for which a weak broad component of the h@xmath14 emission line has been detected in their optical spectra , while in all objects the narrow h@xmath14 component is probably due to the starburst .",
    "a correlation between the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity versus the h@xmath14 luminosity has been widely observed in high and low luminosity agns ( ward et al .",
    "1988 , ho et al . 2001 ) .",
    "iras00317@xmath102142 , iras20051@xmath101117 and iras20069@xmath615929 , for which we consider only the broad h@xmath14 components , follow the ho et al .",
    "( 2001 ) correlation ( which applies to both high and low luminosity agns ) .",
    "the remaining three composites for which the broad h@xmath0 was not measured are generally fainter both in x - rays and in the optical band ; therefore it is likely that an optical emission line luminosity of a factor of 2 - 3 lower could be difficult to measure . using the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation , we derived the sfr from the h@xmath14 luminosity produced by the narrow component and we estimated the expected 2 - 10 kev luminosity to be produced by that sfr ( ranalli et al .",
    "the expected 2 - 10 kev luminosities are in the range of 10@xmath62 erg s@xmath12 , i.e. a factor of 50 - 100 lower than the observed ones .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous interpretation that in all objects the narrow h@xmath14 component is probably due to the starburst , and the x - rays to the agn .",
    "for the three objects for which we have a measure of the broad h@xmath0 component , we attempt an estimate of the black hole mass . we make use of the formula @xmath63 ( mclure & dunlop 2001 ) and of a few additional assumptions . the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 erg s@xmath12)@xmath66 in light days ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) require a measure of the broad @xmath67 emission , which is not detected because swamped by the narrow line produced by the starburst and of the agn continuum , which we do not measure directly .",
    "we substitute the fwhm of h@xmath50 with the fwhm of the broad h@xmath0 that we attribute to the agn ( from m96 ) .",
    "if anything , the h@xmath0 is usually broader than h@xmath50 , therefore we will overestimate the resulting mass .",
    "we infer the agn continuum from the template fitted to the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this is a rough approximation of the real illuminating continuum , but it should be correct within an order of magnitude at least . plugging these numbers in the above formula",
    "we derive numbers for the mass of the order of a few 10@xmath68 m@xmath69 .",
    "an order of magnitude uncertainty on the l@xmath70 changes the mass by 10@xmath66 .",
    "we therefore can conclude that most probably the masses of these black holes are small and that they could possibly undergo strong changes in accretion rate when they brighten .",
    "we have found a possible analogy between our sources and the seyfert 1.5 ngc 4395 .",
    "it is a low luminosity agn with a small black hole mass , that shows x - ray variability , although more violent than what observed in the composites ( vaughan et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the black hole mass range is consistent with all these objects being late type galaxies ( as indicated by their morphological types in table  [ sample ] ) with small stellar bulges .",
    "in fact , from their total b - band magnitude and an average bulge / total flux ratio typical of their morphological type ( de jong 1996 ) , we derived the black hole mass values which are consistent with those previously found , when assuming that the @xmath71 correlation ( e.g. , yu & tremaine 2002 ) still holds for late type spirals .",
    "detailed follow up observations ( e.g. high spatial resolution optical spectroscopy ) are needed in order to provide a more reliable estimate of the black hole mass for these objects .",
    "new _ chandra _ and _ beppo_sax observations of 4 and 3 composites , respectively , have deepened our knowledge of this class of sources . based on the x - ray analysis presented here , composite galaxies behave like typical type 1 agns in the x - ray band : their emission is dominated by a bright nuclear source , whose spectral properties are typical of this class . a power - law model with spectral index ( @xmath1 = 1.7 - 2.1 ) and little intrinsic absorption ( n@xmath34 @xmath8 4@xmath4 10@xmath32 cm@xmath19 ) well describe their spectra .",
    "iron lines are not significantly detected ( upper limits on their equivalent widths are below @xmath2 400 ev ) .",
    "large flux variability is found on many different temporal scales .    a broad analysis of the whole composite sample , carried out by adding to our x - ray data the results from georgantopoulos ( 2000 ) , georgantopoulos , zezas & ward ( 2003 ) , georgantopoulos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and multi - wavelength data from the literature , has revealed that the study of this class is relevant both for the investigation of the agn - starburst connection and for the x - ray properties in medium / low luminosity agns .",
    "interestingly enough , agn and starburst activity seem to be present with almost the same intensity in this class of objects .",
    "spectral energy distributions have clearly shown that the different emission components contribute to different spectral energy bands : the infrared emission is probably dominated by the starburst and the x - ray one derives from the agn .",
    "the optical continuum is mainly contaminated by the host galaxy light while the emission line spectrum shows narrow emission lines produced by starburst . the h@xmath14 emission line is probably associated to both : the narrow component to the starburst and the broad component , when bright enough to be detected , correlates well with the hard x - ray luminosity , and therefore is to be ascribed to photoionization by the agn .",
    "it is unlikely that heavy obscuration that could explain the weakness of the agn in the optical band is present , as shown by the pronounced x - ray variability and low column densities and by the flux diagnostic diagrams shown in section 7.1 .",
    "a dusty clumpy ionized absorber , able to selectively obscure the optical emission , that leaves the x - ray emission almost unabsorbed ( georgantopoulos 2000 ; maiolino et al . 2001 ) is clearly possible .",
    "however the detection of broad h@xmath14 with fwhm typical of type 1 objects makes this hypothesis remote . in conclusion ,",
    "the lack of clear indications of the presence of an agn in the optical spectra of the composites is probably due to a combination of the faintness of the agn itself and of the masking effect of the starburst .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the most striking characteristic of composite galaxies is the strong , long- and short - term , x - ray variability observed .",
    "rosat observation taken between 1991 and 1992 reveal bright soft nuclei at the level of 10@xmath72 erg / s .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ beppo_sax observations taken nearly 10 years later reveal that , in most cases , these objects are fainter .",
    "two objects show a variation in flux by a factor of 20 , while in two other objects the fluxes decreased by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "it is likely that the inclusion of these sources in the rass - iras correlation of m96 is partly due to their bright state at that time .",
    "what is the cause for their brightening ?",
    "are they now fading away or just changing state every once in a while ?    concerning the flux variation of a factor of @xmath220 over @xmath210 yrs , we can not say much : it is not an extreme value , but certainly not the most common ( see eg .",
    "ulrich et al 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the data sampling is very scanty and does not allow us to determine the time dependence of the variability .",
    "on the contrary , the flux variability on short time scales , with variations by a factor of 2 - 3 on time scales of @xmath2 4 ks , coupled to an estimate of low values for the central black hole mass ( even though based more on assumptions that on measurements ) , could fit with the observed trend of higher variability for smaller black hole masses , and could also be linked to variations in the accretion rate ( oneill et al .",
    "2005 , mushotzky et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "even if small , this sample has a statistically sound definition that makes results applicable to other candidates .",
    "we can not estimate their space density , however we notice that several examples of objects with similar characteristics have already appeared in the literature ( griffiths et al .",
    "1996 , della ceca et al .",
    "2001 , guainazzi et al .",
    "2000 ) , which suggests that they might constitute a non - negligible fraction of the agn family .",
    "we therefore suggest the use of a combination of diagnostic ratios , such as those based on the [ oiii]/fir ratio and the presence of x - ray emission to pinpoint members of this class of composites .",
    "new spitzer space telescope and _ chandra _ data would be of crucial importance to deepen our knowledge on the composite sample and to enlarge the number of candidates belonging to the same class .",
