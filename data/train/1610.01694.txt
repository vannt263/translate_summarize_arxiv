    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of non - uniform rational b - splines ( nurbs)-based _ isogeometric analysis ( iga ) _ finite element methods ( igafem ) for solving time - harmonic acoustic wave scattering and acoustic wave propagation problems , most particularly for small wavelengths . to fix the notations ,",
    "let us consider @xmath0 as a @xmath1-dimensional ( @xmath2 ) scattering bounded domain of @xmath3 , with shape @xmath4 .",
    "we introduce the associated exterior ( i.e. unbounded ) domain of propagation @xmath5 .",
    "then , solving the scattering problem leads to computing the wave field @xmath6 , solution to the boundary - value problem ( bvp ) : given an incident ( plane wave ) field @xmath7 , find @xmath6 such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the laplacian operator , @xmath10 the gradient operator and @xmath11 is the outward - directed unit normal vector to @xmath12 .",
    "the spatial variable is @xmath13 in 2d and @xmath14 in 3d .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath15 is related to the wavelength @xmath16 by the relation : @xmath17 .",
    "the boundary condition is a neumann ( sound - hard ) boundary condition ( but other boundary conditions could also be considered ) . denoting by @xmath18 the hermitian inner - product of two complex - valued vector fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then the last equation of system ( [ systhelm ] )",
    "is known as the sommerfeld s radiation condition @xcite at infinity , which presents the outgoing wave to the domain .",
    "various numerical methods have been developed to accurately solve the exterior scattering problem , e.g. finite elements @xcite , boundary elements @xcite , enriched and various modified ( wave - based , hybrid , asymptotic ) finite elements @xcite .",
    "a challenging and still outstanding question for numerics and applications is related to the so - called _ high - frequency _ regime , where the wavelength @xmath16 is very small compared with the characteristic length of the scatterer @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a first `` exact '' method consists in writing an integral equation on the surface @xmath22 to represent the exterior field , and then solving this by means of a boundary element method , combined with fast evaluation algorithms ( e.g. fast multilevel multipole methods ( mfmm)@xcite , adaptive cross approximation ( aca ) @xcite ) and preconditioned ( matrix - free ) krylov subspace iterative solvers ( gmres ) @xcite .",
    "this approach has the very interesting property to reduce the initial problem to a finite @xmath23-dimensional problem ( set on @xmath22 ) and to be relatively stable thanks to the frequency regime ( typically between @xmath24 to @xmath25 points per wavelength are used , with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 the meshsize ) . nevertheless , the method is nontrivial to adapt to complex geometries , when the boundary conditions are modified or when a high - order of accuracy is required for the solution .",
    "in particular , developing efficient algorithms when the geometry is described with high accuracy remains an open question , most particularly for large wave numbers @xmath15 since the number of degrees of freedom is potentially very large .",
    "another standard and very attractive engineering - type approach consists in truncating the exterior domain @xmath28 through the introduction of a fictitious boundary / layer @xmath29 that surrounds the scatterer @xmath21 , resulting in a bounded computational domain @xmath30 with inner boundary @xmath22 and outer boundary / layer @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath29 is a boundary , an _ absorbing boundary condition ( abc ) _",
    "@xcite is set on the fictitious boundary which introduces a truncation error even at the continuous level .",
    "this can be reduced by considering high - order ( local ) abcs .",
    "a very popular alternative is , rather , to consider a surrounding absorbing layer and modifying the nonphysical media to obtain a perfectly matched layer @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", since our goal is to understand the quality of the nurbs - approximations used in isogeometric analysis ( iga ) to approximate the wave field , we will consider simple boundary conditions where we can separate the continuous truncation error from the numerical approximation .",
    "high - order abcs as well as pml will be treated in future work .",
    "when the problem is truncated , any numerical method can be used such as e.g. finite - element methods , the resulting linear system being then solved through well - adapted domain decomposition techniques @xcite . in the high frequency regime , it is well - known that the numerical solution suffers from a phase shift due to numerical dispersion which is called the _ pollution error _ @xcite of the finite element method . to maintain a prescribed pollution error ,",
    "the mesh density @xmath31 should be increased faster than the wave number leading to high computational cost for high frequency problems .",
    "therefore , the fem is limited to a upper frequency bound for which the computational cost becomes prohibitive and increasing the order of the polynomial basis functions used in conventional fem is required to reduce the pollution error , but it does not fully eliminate it .",
    "original techniques were recently proposed to reduce the pollution error .",
    "one approach is to replace the basis functions , usually a polynomial , with plane wave functions @xcite .",
    "since pollution error can be viewed as a phase shift , another hybrid approach is to asymptotically approximate the phase of the solution and to reformulate the problem into an equivalent problem with a slowly varying unknown @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , until now , the only viable solution for complex problems is to consider a sufficiently high - order polynomial basis into the fem together with high - order meshes to represent accurately the geometry @xmath22 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze the quality of alternative approximation methods based on b - splines and nurbs - based _",
    "isogeometic analysis ( iga ) _ and to compare the properties of these approximation schemes to more traditional , lagrange - based high - order fem .",
    "the goal of the paper is , specifically , to investigate the properties of the methods for large wave numbers @xmath15 .",
    "isogeometric analysis ( iga ) was introduced over 10 years ago to streamline the transition from computer - aided design to analysis @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the approach is to use the same shape functions to approximate the field variables as those used to describe the geometry of the domain . as the geometry of computational domains",
    "is typically provided by computer - aided design ( cad ) software , it is sensible to use nurbs shape functions , which are the most commonly used functions in cad .",
    "since 2005 , iga has been developed within the finite element , boundary element @xcite and was enriched through partition of unity @xcite iga benefits from exact ( and smooth ) geometry representation and no loss of boundary details .",
    "this is fundamental in problems involving wave propagation or turbulence , as spurious wave scattering and vortices typically appear close to rough boundaries .",
    "iga therefore alleviates the meshing burden as if the cad model is modified , any modifications are immediately inherited by the shape functions used for analysis . when coupled to boundary element approaches , this suppresses completely the generation and regeneration of the mesh without any regeneration of the mesh @xcite . when used within a finite element approach , volume parameterization is still required , but the shape optimization process is simplified @xcite .",
    "since cad models are generated from the boundary data , _ iga boundary element method ( igabem ) _ is promising in bridging the gap between cad and analysis offering a unique shape optimization package @xcite .",
    "iga additionally offers higher inter - patch continuity , large support sizes and superior refinement capabilities compared to lagrange - based approximation schemes .",
    "a recent review of iga and its computer implementation aspects is available in @xcite .",
    "geopde is another open source iga research tool @xcite which provides a flexible coding structure .",
    "the application of iga and its performance in solving one- and two - dimensional eigenvalue and interior helmholtz problems have been studied @xcite in which iga showed superiority to conventional fem .",
    "however , the performance of iga in solving exterior scattering problems and related pollution error is still not thoroughly investigated . in this paper",
    ", we study the performance of iga for solving time - harmonic exterior scattering problems in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "first , in section [ sec : iga ] , we briefly present the isogeometric analysis and the related nurbs and b - spline basis functions .",
    "then in section [ sec:1d ] , we consider a simple but meaningful one - dimensional scattering problem and provide a pseudo - code to solve it in iga context . in section [ sec:2d ] , we consider two - dimensional problems and study the performance of iga in estimating the scattered field of a duct and a circular cylinder .",
    "the in - house iga and lagrange - based fem codes developed in this study were written in matlab following the geopde platform for two- and three - dimensional examples .",
    "finally , section [ sectionconclude ] conclude the paper .",
    "in iga , both the physical model and the solution space are constructed by _ b - spline / nurbs _ functions .",
    "the model is constructed using a set of control points and _ knot vectors _ in each spatial direction .",
    "a knot vector is defined as a set of non - decreasing coordinates and represented by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the @xmath34 knot and @xmath35 is the knot index , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the polynomial order and @xmath38 is the number of basis functions .",
    "usually an _ open knot vector _ is used in iga where the first and the last knot values appear @xmath39 times .",
    "the elements in iga are defined as non - zero knot intervals . if the knots are spaced equally within the knot vector , the knot vector is called _ uniform",
    "_ otherwise it is _ non - uniform_.      a b - spline basis function is defined recursively by the cox - de boor recursion formula starting with the zeroth order @xmath40 basis function : @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is defined to be zero . to compute the tangent and the normal functions , it is required to calculate the derivative of b - splines .",
    "efficient algorithms to calculate b - splines and their derivatives can be found in the nurbs book by piegl and tiller @xcite .",
    "the first - order b - spline functions are identical to their lagrangian ( fem ) counterparts . also , the b - splines number of required shape functions for a specific order is similar to that of the fem .",
    "for example , three shape functions are required to construct second - order lagrangian or b - spline shape functions .",
    "in contrast to fem , the shape functions in iga are non - negative .",
    "the first derivative of the b - spline basis function is calculated using the following recursive formula : @xmath44 these functions exhibit @xmath45 continuity across knot @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the multiplicity of the knot @xmath46 .",
    "the b - spline basis function corresponding to @xmath48 are shown in fig .",

    "the piecewise - polynomial b - spline curves in @xmath52 are constructed as a linear combination of b - spline basis functions : @xmath53 the vector - valued coefficients of the basis functions in eq.[eq : bcurve ] are control points ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "since @xmath55 is representing a curve , the corresponding control points , @xmath56 , are analogous to nodal coordinates in fem .",
    "the resulting curve is @xmath57-continuous everywhere except at the location of the repeated knots with @xmath47 multiplicity , where it is @xmath58-continuous .",
    "therefore , when utilizing open knot vectors , the resulting curve is @xmath59-continuous , tangent to the control polygon , and interpolatory at the start and the end of the curve and where the multiplicity is equal to the polynomial order .",
    "the support of a b - spline basis function is local . in other words , moving a single control point can affect the geometry of no more than @xmath39 elements of the curve .",
    "a tensor product b - spline surface is defined as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 are control points , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are univariate b - spline functions of orders @xmath64 and @xmath65 corresponding to the knot vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "similarly , a b - spline volume is constructed as a tensor product of three b - spline basis functions : @xmath68      there are certain geometries , such as circles and ellipsoids , which b - spline functions and lagrange polynomials can not represent exactly . in the cad community , b - spline functions are replaced with a more general form to overcome this shortcoming . this new form is called _ non - uniform rational b - splines ( nurbs)_. nurbs shape functions are defined as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a set of b - spline basis functions and @xmath71 is a set of positive nurbs weights . by appropriate weight selection",
    "both polynomials and circular arcs can be described .",
    "nurbs curves are defined as follows : @xmath72 similarly , rational surfaces and volumes are defined in terms of rational basis functions as : @xmath73 @xmath74 if the weights are all equal , nurbs basis functions will reduce to their b - spline counterparts and the corresponding curve becomes a non - rational polynomial again .",
    "the geometry of an element in iga can be expressed as : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the spatial dimension .",
    "the field @xmath78 is similarly expressed as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the set of control variables . as a consequence of the parametric definition of basis functions in iga ,",
    "it is necessary to consider two mapping for integration @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are representing the parent and parameter spaces respectively , and @xmath84 is the physical space .",
    "now , let us come back to our physical problem by considering the simple one - dimensional neumann scattering problem solved in @xcite : @xmath85 the variational formulation is given as : @xmath86 the solution of the one - dimensional bvp ( [ eq:1dbvp ] ) is : @xmath87 , which represents the scattering of an incident plane wave by the left half space .",
    "an exact transparent boundary condition is considered for the fictitious boundary at @xmath88 using the dirichlet - to - neumann operator @xmath89 on @xmath29 , resulting in the transparent boundary condition @xmath90 .",
    "it is shown that the finite element approximated solution of the bvp described in system ( [ eq:1dbvp ] ) suffers from the pollution error @xcite .",
    "the pollution error has a direct relation with the wavenumber @xmath15 and increases with frequency .",
    "it is the polynomial basis used in conventional fem which is inadequate to represent the wavefield . since the main difference of the iga with the conventional fem is in the selection of the basis function , it is interesting to study the performance of iga specially in high frequencies and its pollution error .",
    "we divide the computational bounded domain @xmath91 into @xmath92 uniform non - zero knot spans ( elements ) so that each segment length is @xmath93 .",
    "we define the density of discretization as the number of elements per wavelength and denote it with @xmath94 .",
    "a matlab code was prepared to solve the above example in iga context .",

    "b - spline functions generated with @xmath113 and @xmath114 orders will result in the same piecewise constant and linear functions as standard fem shape functions .",
    "the differences are found for cases using higher order shape functions .",
    "the @xmath115 order b - spline function has @xmath116 continuous derivatives across the element boundaries .",
    "each b - spline basis is point - wise non - negative over the entire domain as a result , all of the entries of the mass matrix will be positive .",
    "the support of a b - spline function of order @xmath37 is always @xmath117 knot spans .",
    "therefore , higher order b - spline function has support over much larger portion of the domain when compared to classical fem .",
    "the total number of functions that any given function shares support with ( including itself ) is @xmath118 regardless of whether a fem basis or a b - splines is used .",
