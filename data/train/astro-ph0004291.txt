    "x - ray observations of radio - galaxies can play an important role in understanding the agn radio - loud and radio - quiet dichotomy .",
    "several authors have speculated upon the possibility that the agn distinction in two big families reflects different physical properties of the nuclear engine .",
    "several years ago , rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , suggested that in the nuclei of radio - galaxies a spinning black hole is surrounded by a hot thick accretion flow , in contrast with the radio - quiet picture , which assumes the accreting material in shape of cold thin disk .",
    "later , other authors ( blandford 1990 , meier these proceedings ) indicated the black hole spin as the physical parameter responsible of the agn dichotomy , being more rapid in radio - louds and therefore more efficient in producing powerful jets .",
    "x - ray photons are produced in the inner regions ( @xmath0 pc ) of agn and provide crucial information on physical processes occurring very near to the black hole .",
    "x - ray studies of radio - galaxies are then essential to answer a fundamental question : are the same accretion processes at work in radio - loud and radio - quiet agns ?    in this paper , we present an on - going analysis of radio - galaxies observations performed with the bepposax satellite ( 0.1 - 150 kev ) and discuss the results of a comparative study between our sources and a sample of 12 seyfert galaxies @xcite observed with the same satellite .",
    "our sample ( table 1 ) consists of 6 broad line radio galaxies ( blrg ) , the radio - loud counterpart of seyferts 1 in the agn unified schemes .",
    "most of the sources have a fanaroff - riley ( fr ) ii radio morphology and 3 shows superluminal motions . for comparison , one narrow line radio galaxy ( nlrg ) , centaurus a ( cen a ) ,",
    "is also included in the sample .",
    "as two observations are available for this source , a spectral variability study was also possible .",

    ".    a simple power law plus galactic absorption generally did not give good fits to the data .",
    "we then tested a more complex model which takes into account all the spectral components usually observed in seyfert 1 galaxies : a power law which an exponential cutoff ( cutoff ) , a fluorescence k@xmath12 iron line and a reflection component ( refl ) .",
    "the theoretical picture which interprets the seyfert spectra assumes a cold thin optically thick disk with a hot corona above it .",
    "the corona produces the x - ray photons by inverse compton of the uv disk radiation .",
    "the disk itself reprocesses the down - scattered x - ray radiation producing the iron line and a hump above @xmath13 kev @xcite .",
    "a multicomponent spectrum is generally a good representation of the data , although all the spectral features were not always simultaneously present in each source . in some cases , it was also necessary to include a soft excess ( parameterized with a steep power law @xmath14 ) and/or to include an extra absorption in addition to the galactic one ( see table 2 ) .",

    ", asca detected a broad iron line in both these sources @xcite , as expected if produced in the inner region of the accretion flow .    in this case , * the observed dilution of the equivalent width could be produced by an increase of the jet intensity rather than by a delayed response of the cold matter to variations of the x - ray source*.",
    "bepposax analysis of radio - galaxies has pointed out important differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet agn and has clearly shown , for the first time , that in blrgs the iron line equivalent widths ( and probably the reflection strengths ) are significantly smaller than in seyferts 1 .    in some radio - galaxies",
    "the cold material responsible for the line production is located far from the x - ray primary source .",
    "it is possible that the innermost part of the accretion flow is not in shape of cold disk .",
    "the accretion flow might be then hot and geometrically thick in the inner regions @xcite and cold optically thick @xcite only at larger radii , subtending relatively smaller solid angles ( compared to seyfert 1s ) .",
    "featureless spectra or weak iron lines could be signatures of low efficiency accretion processes .    in sources with seyfert - like spectra ( i.e , with soft excess , strong uv bump and broad iron lines ) ,",
