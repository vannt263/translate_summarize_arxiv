    "a recent seminal discovery elucidated that in nature a simple physical principle rules often the growth of ` random networks ' . the so called preferential attachment ( ` the rich get richer ' ) rule leads to complex networks that have properties contrasting those predicted from classical random network theory @xcite .",
    "a fundamental universality principle of physics must be held responsible for this change of paradigm .",
    "the preferential attachment principle expresses in our interpretation that for the formation of ensembles , attractive forces that are generally valid over decades of spatial extensions are required ( that in physics may involve mass , charge , e.g. ) .",
    "it is this principle that generates the celebrated power laws observed in the distribution of mesoscopic network indicators , such as network degree , connectivity weight @xcite , or neuronal avalanche size @xcite .",
    "second _ fundamental universality principle of physics is , however , active at the same time , that has passed unnoticed so far .",
    "it is the fact that real - world connectivity requires space , and that this space is limited .",
    "the question that we address in our work is what the traces of this principle will be , during network formation and regarding the final network .",
    "this question has not been answered so far .",
    "to study this question , we consider a novel generic network building algorithm ( our primary model ) that implements both principles at the most basic level as follows .",
    "we start from a connected network of @xmath0 nodes . with probability @xmath1 , an ` outside ' node , from a finite set of available nodes ,",
    "is added ; alternatively , with probability @xmath2 , an attempt is made to construct an inside edge ( see below ) .",
    "if an outside node is added , the new node joins the network by @xmath3 edges , where the target nodes are sampled according to their degree @xmath4 ( i.e. @xmath5 ) , following preferential attachment . for an inside edge ,",
    "two nodes are independently chosen along preferential attachment ( i.e. , proportional to the degree they have ) .",
    "if the two chosen nodes are not identical and not already connected , an edge is established . in this way , the algorithm s second alternative expresses the second fundamental principle in terms of an edge saturation ( at a level defined by @xmath1 and @xmath3 , implemented right from the start of the network s growth ) .",
    "the process stops if the set of available nodes is depleted .",
    "the algorithm generates undirected topological networks of arbitrary size , void of loops and multiple - edges ; examples will be discussed later .",
    "[ fig : varyp ] shows the stereotypical degree distribution obtained in this way , exhibiting an extended power - law part of the distribution terminated by a hump ( that , upon the network s growth , moves towards larger degrees , until the process is stopped by node depletion , cf .",

    "while we observe a wide - spread activity to find power - law distributions in all areas of physics , we emphasize that based on the fundamental ingredients necessary in the network building process , only in rare cases neat power laws will be found .",
    "examples of experimental data with the deviations that our key principles predict are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varyp0 ] . while our real - world examples are often related to biology ( mostly because of the great availability of the underlying data , and because of the greater simplicity of the examples ) ,",
    "all of our arguments are immediately transferable to physical situations where previous analysis has generally stopped at the preferential attachment level .",
    "our analysis now provides guidelines for inferring from macroscopic measurements the microscopic properties that dominate network growth ( cf .",
    "[ fig : varyp2 ] , where the humpiness of the distribution @xmath10 was evaluated as the deviation from the power law @xmath11 excluding the hump , as @xmath12 ) .",
    "this provides an important input for the modeling of real world systems ( see , e.g. , the drosophila network example discussed below ) . by superposition of prototypes with different @xmath1 and @xmath3 parameters ,",
    "more general hump structures can be generated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : varyp0 ] ) .",

    "@xcite ) , a network generated along the two fundamental physical principles embodied in our primary model , will not be necessarily sparse ( this would imply a power - law exponent @xmath13 , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : varyp ] ) .",
    "moreover , also dorogovtsev and mendes modified preferential attachment algorithm with its double regimes of power - law behavior @xcite deviates from the fundamental principles that we have worked out . that model uses a second internal linking process that is always successful in making new connections . in our case",
    "it is exactly the edge connection failures ( by edge saturation ) that define the network structure . whereas the rate of internal linking in their algorithm accelerates with the network size",

    "to better understand how the statistical properties and in particular , saturation , emerge from the model , we focus on a semi - analytical growth description , in which the natural time step @xmath21 is the addition of one node to the network . the degree distribution from a network growth algorithm is usually determined from a differential equation that describes the rate of addition of new edges to a given node , as a function of the time @xmath22 at which the node has joined the network @xcite , i.e. @xmath23 for our algorithm , the topological constraint on the addition of inside edges implies that @xmath24 can not be determined analytically from the single node information @xmath25 , but requires the full pairwise connection information of the network encoded in the adjacency matrix at time @xmath21 , @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 to work around this complication , we make the following ansatz .",
    "we suppose that the probability of failure while trying to add an inside edge @xmath28 to an already chosen node @xmath29 , can be expressed by a mean field ` saturation ' function @xmath30 in terms of the degree @xmath4 of node @xmath29 . furthermore",

    "the whole equation has been rescaled by @xmath43 ( canceling the @xmath1 in the first term s numerator ) such that @xmath21 corresponds to the number of nodes in the network .",
    "as can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rate ] ) , our growth algorithm provides two well - known limiting cases . for @xmath44",
    "we retrieve the preferential attachment growth process @xcite . for @xmath45 , the network will not add nodes and must asymptotically become a clique of size @xmath0 . in between , for @xmath46 ,",

    "similarly , as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , ( the network will tend toward a clique , where all possible connections already exist ) . when @xmath63 , @xmath30 ceases to be relevant .",
    "finally , for any @xmath64 , as @xmath65 , @xmath66 , since the number of inside edges added at each time - step approximates a constant value , so the network becomes increasingly sparse .",
    "we can use @xmath30 to infer the generated unnormalized degree probability distribution , @xmath67 as follows .",
    "starting from the continuity equation , we may write @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by eq .",

    "examples of edge saturation network growth emerge from the fundamental situation where the state of a physical system is described by a symbol , and where time acting on the states leads to a description in terms of a language ( symbolic dynamics and formal languages @xcite , natural languages ) . starting with a finite number of @xmath0 states , observations of the system in time yield sequences of states , that define links on a graph between nodes ( states ) , which implies that more important or more versatile nodes will have more links .",
    "as such a network evolves for a finer description , two processes may occur : 1 ) adjacencies are established between previously unconnected nodes ( preferentially between more versatile ones ) ; 2 ) a new node is added and connected preferentially to already highly connected nodes .",
    "evidently , in many networks there will , however , be a limitation on the number of edges that can be hosted by a given node .",
    "the _ drosophila _ courtship body language of 37 fundamental behavioral states @xcite and its network is an example of such a process .",
    "the states are fundamental in the sense that each act could , from the view of the physics of body motion , be followed by any other act",
    ". some transitions , however , are generally not taken , leading to edges missing .",
    "well - defined connected sub - networks characterize a chosen courtship partner s class , according to which protagonists can be distinguished ( male , female ( virgin , mature , mated ) , fruitless ) . within these bounds",
    ", courtship exploits the available expression space , corroborating the view that it might advertise individual properties of the sender , into the eyes of a courtship partner @xcite . to compare our network growth algorithm with the data from male - female interaction , we grow the network until the number of nodes ( symbols ) is depleted , with @xmath1 chosen so that on average the number of edges matches that of the courtship network .",
    "a comparison -without further fitting- exhibits that the two degree distributions match extremely well and that the proposed generating algorithm is very specific ( fig .",
    "[ fig : varym2 ] ) .",
    "our paradigm may also appear in the guise of an equilibrium condition in the following sense .",
    "complex networks in physics or in biology are often constrained to maintain some average conditions .",
    "as soon as ( possibly : self - enhancing ) node interaction sets in , this needs to be balanced by homeostasis , i.e. a competitive , counter - balancing mechanism that weakens other connections of the same node to the network @xcite . in the neural networks domain ,",
    "a closely related principle is known as ` hebbian learning ' @xcite .",
    "self - organized hebbian - learning @xcite in the super - paramagnetic @xcite phase of ensembles has been proven a reliable and efficient way of clustering that does away with convexity requirements of cluster borders @xcite .",
    "a very similar approach has also been used as a synchronization model for coupled oscillators , where the oscillators struggle to synchronize is expressed by competing connection strengths @xmath76 that evolve according to the dynamical update rule @xmath77 @xcite , where @xmath78 measures the pairwise oscillator synchrony .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath76 has been shown to tend for intermediate coupling strengths towards a hump - terminated power - law ( cf .",
    "[ fig : varyp0]a ) .",
    "this dynamical law expresses the limited resources available for the local wiring around each node , which in our model is encoded in the probability @xmath1 ruling the edge saturation .",
    "we envisage that also avalanche distributions of the typical form of fig .",
    "2a ) could be understood similarly @xcite .",
    "many interesting real - world phenomena dwell on the mesoscale . in social networks ,",
    "the largest scale is relevant , e.g. , for the study of disease and rumor spreading , but more subtle social dynamics happens within the community structures @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that a large class of systems can be formulated as growing along simple principles , similar and in addition to preferential attachment .",
    "the sets of @xmath3 , @xmath1 parameters needed to recover an experimental distribution , i.e. the violation of the ideal power law on the macroscopic scale , provides us with an insight about the local mesoscale structures present in the network . in this way",
