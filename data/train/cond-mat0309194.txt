    "in recent times , following developments in spin glass mean field theory @xcite , much emphasis has been put on the study of off - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations during aging dynamics in glassy systems . these relations quantify the deviation of the ratio between correlation functions and conjugated responses from the one implied by the fluctuation dissipation theorem valid at equilibrium , and have been posed at the basis of a detailed thermodynamical and statistical description of the dynamics of glasses @xcite .",
    "linear response theory allows to relate possible asymptotic violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem to the failure of ergodicity at the level of the equilibrium measure @xcite .",
    "given the correlation function @xmath0 of a certain observable @xmath1 , and its conjugated response function @xmath2 describing the effect at time @xmath3 of a field conjugated to @xmath1 acting from time @xmath4 to time @xmath5 , one can define the fluctuation - dissipation ratio ( fdr ) @xmath6 from the relation : @xmath7 this is just unity in equilibrium conditions while deviates from it off - equilibrium and in general depends on the observable quantity @xmath1 at hand . in mean field spin glasses",
    "the fdr admits a non trivial limit in the aging regime , where the correlations assume a scaling invariant behaviour .",
    "moreover , in the long time limit , taken after the thermodynamic limit , one can define the function @xmath8 which can have a non trivial behavior .",
    "when this happens , @xmath9 turns out to have an important covariance property under exchange of the given observable @xmath1 chosen in the measure of correlation and response .",
    "if we have a correlation function @xmath10 corresponding to an observable @xmath1 and a correlation function @xmath11 corresponding to an observable @xmath12 , and we define an auxiliary limiting function @xmath13 , the following relation holds @xmath14 the meaning of which is that the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 coincide asymptotically for equal times . moreover , in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that in a large class of finite dimensional systems with short range interaction @xmath9 defined in an out of equilibrium context is deeply related to the nature of the equilibrium free - energy landscape . in fact , considering the overlap probability function ( opf ) @xmath17 @xcite describing the statistics at equilibrium of the correlations of the observable @xmath1 in two configurations chosen with boltzmann weight , the linear response theory implies : @xmath18 this equality implies that either @xmath9 and @xmath17 are both non trivial or they are both trivial and could be taken as the starting point for an experimental measure of the equilibrium opf from off - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "of course it does not imply the existence of some short range system where it is verified non - trivially .",
    "going through the derivation one realizes that ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) expresses the commutation of the thermodynamic limit and the long time limit as far as certain susceptibilities are concerned .",
    "notice also that , thanks to ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) , equation ( [ eq : x_a ] ) expresses the fact that for two observables @xmath1 and @xmath12 , couples of states with identical @xmath19 also have identical @xmath20 , i.e. the function @xmath21 defined in the dynamics describes the relation between different overlaps in equilibrium ergodic components .",
    "this property has been shown to be deeply related to ultrametricity in @xcite where it was found that the combination of relations ( [ eq : x_a ] ) and ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) implies ultrametricity .",
    "the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) has been clarified in @xcite where it has been discussed how @xmath9 can be related to the density of metastable states -or quasi - states- with free - energy density slightly above the minimum , implying that quasi - states of equal free - energy are selected with equal probability during the dynamical process . the identity ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) and the covariance property ( [ eq : x_a ] ) , allow to rationalize @xcite the interpretation of the ratios @xmath22 for different values of @xmath23 as effective temperatures governing the exchanges of heat among slow modes evolving on waiting time dependent time scales @xcite .",
    "effective temperatures dependent on @xmath23 mean that while modes evolving on the same scale are in equilibrium with each other , heat exchanges between modes evolving on widely separated scales do not occur .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that in trap models where @xmath9 has a non trivial @xmath23 dependence , but ultrametricity does not hold , different quantities define different fdr . a situation where it would be difficult to identify the fdr s with effective temperatures .",
    "conversely , j .-",
    "barrat and l. berthier @xcite studied lennard - jones models of glass - forming liquids where an fdr constant in @xmath23 seem to describe the off - equilibrium dynamics , and found that density fluctuations at different wave vectors define the same fdr .",
    "numerical simulations of 3 and 4 dimensional spin glass edwards - anderson models , comparing extrapolations of the opf from finite size systems and extrapolations of the fdr from finite time indicate the non - triviality -and consistently the identity- of both functions @xcite .",
    "this has been taken as an evidence in favor of a `` replica symmetry breaking scenario '' ( rsb ) for finite dimensional spin glasses .",
    "these extrapolations however have been questioned in a series of papers showing that the opf in systems without rsb , i.e where the opf is trivial in the thermodynamic limit , can be plagued by severe finite size effects such that for relatively small systems it appears similar to what one expect for systems with rsb @xcite . in such conditions",
    "rsb could be wrongly inferred from extrapolations of the finite size opf @xmath24 of systems of too small sizes @xmath25 , while the true @xmath17 is a trivial single @xmath26-function . in the same way one could doubt that off - equilibrium dynamic simulation times are too short to reliably extrapolate the asymptotic fdr from the finite @xmath5 , and that the true asymptotic one is just a single flat step as in domain growth problems @xcite .    on the experimental side",
    "it is clear that many systems with slow aging dynamics are found in pre - asymptotic regimes .",
    "a common phenomenon is the one of interrupted aging , found e.g. in @xcite , where a slow dynamical regime similar to usual aging eventually crosses over to equilibrium behavior .",
    "in addition , even in three dimensional spin glasses , the paradigmatic systems where aging could persist indefinitely , one sees that many quantities are far from their final values .",
    "in particular the experiments of ocio and hrisson @xcite where the first experimental determination of the fdr in spin glasses was achieved , show fd curves that strongly depend on the waiting time , signifying that the dynamics is still in some pre - asymptotic regime .",
    "in such conditions it is of great interest to inquire if the concepts valid for aging in the asymptotic regime can be adapted to get an adequate picture of the dynamics on much shorter time regimes .    in this context",
    ", one can hypothesize that the identity between static and dynamic fdr found in 3 and 4 dimension is due to the fact that at a given time @xmath5 there is a slowly growing length @xmath27 over which the system has effectively equilibrated , and @xmath28 would approximately respect the relation ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) with @xmath29 .",
    "such an extension would suggest the approximate validity at finite time of a quasi - equilibrium picture of the aging dynamics in which quasi - states with equal free - energy are selected with equal probability , and the static - dynamic equivalence would just reflect the properties of the equilibrium landscape of finite size system .",
    "the hypothesis is rather suggestive as it would provide a framework to interpret aging properties in an appropriate time scale even for systems which display interrupted aging . here , while in a certain time window slow evolution and approximated scaling laws for correlations and/or susceptibilities",
    "are observed , the final asymptotic state is ergodic .    to test this extension l. berthier and",
    "a. barrat @xcite studied the 2d edwards - anderson ( 2dea ) model , which , on one hand displays strong aging effects at finite times , and a non trivial opf for finite size , on the other it is known to finally reach a paramagnetic state at all finite temperatures . in that work it was found that indeed it exists a correspondence @xmath30 such that the relation ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) holds .",
    "more recently , berthier also studied the three and four dimensional case in a pre - asymptotic regime obtaining similar results @xcite .",
    "in the light of the previous considerations about the link among effective temperatures and time scale separation , these finding appear rather surprising . here , no time scale separation is possible , slow modes have to exchange heat in order to eventually equilibrate . in order to save the picture , one can of course hypothesize that this exchange occur `` adiabatically '' , in such a way modes evolving at the same rate appear able to equilibrate at their effective temperature with faster or slower modes before exchange heat",
    ". if this consideration applies fdr corresponding to different quantities should appear approximately equal one to another . in order to test this hypothesis we consider as in @xcite , the 2d edwards - anderson ( 2dea ) model where as mentioned aging is interrupted after a finite relaxation time . in our analysis",
    "we define some suitable correlation and response function not obviously related to the usual spin autocorrelation and its associated response , and compare the fdr for both couples of functions .",
    "in addition , in two dimensions we test the equivalence between the static and the dynamic fdr for the new quantities .",
    "our results are then compared with analogous measures in the viana - bray diluted spin glass , where ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) is known to hold non - trivially .    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the relevant quantities , then we present and discuss the results of the simulations and finally the conclusions are outlined .",
    "the model we will consider consists in a pair of spin glass systems with independent random coupling and identical number of spins coupled through random interactions . before explicitly introduce the model let s say a few words to motivate this choice , keeping in mind that our task will be to compare fdr s corresponding to different correlation - response couples . in spin models , defined in terms of an exchange hamiltonian @xmath31 the natural and most commonly used choice to probe dynamical correlations is the spin autocorrelation function at different times : @xmath32 the corresponding `` zero field cooled '' susceptibility with respect to small local i.i.d .",
    "gaussian fields @xmath33 with variance @xmath34 , introduced in the systems at time @xmath5 and kept on at later times reads , @xmath35 where the over - line denotes the average over the field .",
    "a second common choice is the `` energy correlation function '' also known as `` link overlap '' @xmath36 , and the associated response : @xmath37 . in mean field , for gaussian long range @xmath38 s one can show that in the thermodynamic limit , choosing the variance of the @xmath38 s to be equal to @xmath39 one has for all times and with no assumption about the dynamics : @xmath40 so that , automatically , for all times , the fdr defined with these quantities coincide with the one defined with the usual correlations and response .",
    "analogously at equilibrium , one finds that the relation @xmath41 holds and @xmath42 independently of the ultrametric nature of the organization of the states .",
    "then , in order to test the quasi - equilibrium picture one needs to compare overlaps non - trivially related one to the other .",
    "consider , therefore , two copies of spin glass systems , with identical number of spins , and identically distributed , but independent quenched disorder and coupled by a random field @xmath43 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this compound system is defined by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the quenched disorder in copies 1 and 2 respectively and are quenched variables respecting the lattice topology and otherwise taken as i.i.d . from a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and",
    "variance 1 .",
    "the variables @xmath43 which couple spins with identical label in the two copies have been chosen randomly with values @xmath47 .",
    "the dynamical spin autocorrelation function now reads : @xmath48 and the corresponding response @xmath49    as second couple of correlation response pair we consider the spin cross - correlation function @xcite , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the @xmath52 indicates an average over the initial conditions and @xmath53 over the disorder .",
    "we will speak about direct correlation and response respectively for  ( [ eq : autocorr ] ) and  ( [ eq : susc ] ) and cross correlation and response for  ( [ eq : cross_autocorr ] ) and  ( [ eq : cross_susc ] ) .",
    "an explicit formula for @xmath54 and @xmath55 as functionals of @xmath0 and @xmath56 can be given for small @xmath57 using linear response theory : @xmath58\\\\ \\nonumber r_{cross}(t , t_w)=k^2 \\beta \\int_{t_w}^{t } ds\\ ; r(t , s)r(s , t_w),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that if the cross fdr coincide with the direct one , it is for non trivial reasons .",
    "we studied the cross - quantities in two different systems of ising spins with random quenched disorder , the edward anderson model , a bi - dimensional square lattice of spins of size @xmath59 and the fixed connectivity version @xcite of the viana - bray model @xcite where the spins are on a random lattice with fixed connectivity @xmath60 and size @xmath61 . for both models , we considered two copies with identical number of spins and independent quenched disorder coupled by a random field @xmath47 as in the previous section with @xmath62 . for this large value of @xmath57 we are out of the linear response regime that allowed us to derive the explicit form of the cross - quantities as function of the usual ones , but even if the relations ( [ prod ] ) does not hold , there is no reason to believe that the relation between @xmath63 and @xmath64 becomes trivial .    in order to have as a reference results for a system where the picture sketched in the introduction certainly holds we present first the data of quick simulations of the viana - bray model .    in a first test , we compared the fd plots in dynamic simulations of aging experiments with the static ones obtained through the parallel tempering technique .",
    "our results are summarized in figure [ fig : fluc - dis - vb ] .",
    "we can observe that , on one hand , the static characteristics has small finite size dependence , on the other , the dynamical curves little dependence on the waiting times . as expected",
    "the dynamic curves coincide with the static ones for the direct functions . for the cross functions they also coincide provide the static curves",
    "are shifted vertically , this is normal as it should be noted that , the maximum value of @xmath65 in the equilibrium opf of finite systems is unity , while dynamically @xmath54 is monotonically decreasing from the value @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , one should subtract a constant to the second integral of @xmath68 : @xmath69 to compare it with the the dynamic function .",
    "we then tested to what extent equation ( [ eq : x_a ] ) is valid when finite systems in statics are compared to systems evolved for finite aging times in dynamics . from the statics we get the functions @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath70 where @xmath23 is defined as the usual ( direct ) overlap between two independent replicas @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 , while @xmath74 .",
    "then using  ( [ eq : x_q_pq ] ) we derive the equilibrium quantities @xmath9 and @xmath75 and compare them with the results obtained from the dynamic simulations .",
    "although we did not try to measure the joined probability @xmath76 , we could extract a function @xmath77 as implied by the relation ( [ eq : x_a ] ) and compare with the one directly obtained from the dynamics .",
    "the results can be seen in figure [ fig : q - vs - qn - vb ] where one can see that the static and the dynamic curves approach each other for values of @xmath65 smaller than @xmath78 .",
    "this is what one should expect because , as discussed above , in dynamics this is the largest value of @xmath54 , and tends to its limit from below for @xmath79 .",
    "conversely in statics , for finite systems , the probability distribution always extends to values of @xmath65 larger than the maximum value for an infinite system .",
    "we then pass to the study of the two dimensional system .",
    "we studied the aging dynamics of the 2dea model with unitary gaussian couplings at @xmath80 , where no sign of thermalization can be observed in the correlation function up to waiting times as high as @xmath81 . in our simulations",
    "we used @xmath82 and checked to be in the linear response regime using the value @xmath83 . on the equilibrium side , using the parallel tempering technique @xcite we were able to calculate with good precision , the spin glass order parameter @xmath17 , as well as the function @xmath68 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fluc - dis - ea ] we present a fluctuation - dissipation plot for the model . as observed by l. berthier and a. barrat  @xcite , one can superimpose the finite time curves of the direct functions with the second integral of the equilibrium opf of suitable size systems at the same temperature .",
    "the points represent the data obtained by the dynamic simulation , while the lines those obtained studying the static of the model using the parallel tempering technique .",
    "we present for clarity only plots at two different waiting times , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , for the dynamic simulations and two lattice sizes , @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the static ones .",
    "the upper curves correspond to the usual functions ( similar curves were already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the lower ones , reflects the cross functions .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that in order to superimpose the static and dynamic curves , a vertical shift in @xmath88 is not enough and an horizontal shift , should also be performed .    in order to understand this point",
    "we notice that differently to what happens for the direct function for which by construction @xmath89 , the value of @xmath90 evolves in time . in such conditions",
    "the definition of the fdr in terms of the simple correlation is not necessarily the most appropriate .",
    "in fact , the study of running away systems ( e.g. brownian motion or particles in non confining random potentials @xcite ) shows that a better definition is obtained considering the following combination of the correlation function @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "this obviously is not the only combination which could be used ; e.g. in @xcite it was suggested the use of @xmath92 , however , we preferred to present the data using @xmath93 , which is symmetric in the configurations at the two times and admits the interpretation of a distance between the configurations at times @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "we checked all the results below using @xmath94 instead of @xmath93 which turn out to be equivalent within our numerical accuracy .",
    "the static analogous of the function @xmath95 is , given two configurations @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the quantity @xmath98 $ ] . in order to compare the dynamical fdr with the static one we should be cautious of the symmetry of the hamiltonian under contemporary reversal of all the spins . as discussed in @xcite",
    "the proper static probability distribution to compare with the dynamics is not the full distribution but the distribution modulo the symmetry of the hamiltonian . for the function @xmath17 , symmetric under @xmath99",
    "one just needs to consider the positive @xmath23 part of the function multiplied by 2 ( for normalization ) . in order to eliminate this symmetry in the distribution @xmath100 in an analogous way",
    ", we can just consider the histogram of the @xmath101 corresponding to configurations @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that @xmath102 is positive .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ statdyn2d.eps ] which shows that the agreement between the static and dynamic curves for the cross quantities is comparable to the direct ones , for the same lattice sizes .",
    "next we compare the relation between @xmath95 and @xmath103 obtained directly in dynamics and relating the values with equal @xmath104 in statics as explained above .",
    "this is shown in figure [ statdyn2d - bis ] where we show that for the times and lengths considered there is a good correspondence between statics and dynamics .",
    "finally , given the good quality of our susceptibility data , we could take the derivatives of the @xmath105 versus @xmath12 characteristics so to compare directly at equal times the cross fdr @xmath106 with the direct one @xmath6 .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure [ fdr2d.eps ] which shows that even for waiting times as short as @xmath84 the two quantities are very close to each other .",
    "preliminary results indicate that this is also the case in three and four dimension .",
    "in this paper we have proposed the use of cross correlation functions and response in disordered systems to probe the existence of effective temperatures during aging of disordered systems .",
    "we have compared the behaviour of a mean - field model with the one of a paramagnet , where aging is a transient behavior .",
    "we find that the at equal time the fdr for direct and cross quantities coincide within numerical error after a short transient .",
    "the correspondence among dynamical fdr at finite time and static one for finite size is confirmed as far as the cross quantities are concerned .",
    "these two findings support on one hand the idea that aging dynamics can be described in terms of effective temperatures , on the other that these temperatures are related to the density of states of finite systems on a scale @xmath107 .",
    "preliminary results in three and four dimension indicate that the same kind of behaviour is found in these systems for time scales much shorter than the ones needed to reach an asymptotic state .",
