    "social learning has been a topic of central concern in economics during the last decades @xcite , as it is central to a wide range of socio - economic phenomena .",
    "consumers who want to choose among a given set of available products may seek the opinion of people they trust , in addition to the information they gather from prices and/or advertisement . and",
    "voters who have to decide what candidate to support in an election , or citizens who have to take a stand on some issue of social relevance may rely on their contacts to form their opinion .",
    "ultimately , whether our societies take the right course of action on any given issue ( e.g. on climate change ) will hinge upon our ability to aggregate individual information that is largely disperse .",
    "thus , in particular , it must depend on the information diffusion mechanism by which agents learn from each other , and therefore on the underlying social network in which they are embedded .",
    "the significance of the conceptual challenges raised by these issues is made even more compelling by the booming advance in information and communication technologies , with its impact on the patterns of influence and communication , and on the way and speed in which we communicate .",
    "these key issues have attracted the interest of researchers in several fields .",
    "for example , the celebrated  voter model \" @xcite is a prototype of those simple mechanistic models that are very parsimonious in the description of individual behavior but allow for a full characterization of the collective behavior induced .",
    "the voter model embodies a situation where each agent switches to the opinion / state held by one of the randomly selected neighbors at some given rate , and raises the question of whether the population is able to reach consensus , i.e. a situation where all agents display the same state .",
    "the literature on consensus formation , as reviewed e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , has focused , in particular , on the role played by the structure of the underlying network in shaping the asymptotic behavior .",
    "one of the main insights obtained is that the higher is the effective dimensionality of the network the harder it is for conformity to obtain @xcite .",
    "consensus formation in social systems is closely related to the phenomenon of social learning .",
    "indeed , the latter can be regarded as a particular case of the former , when consensus is reached on some  true \" ( or objective ) state of the world , for example , given by an external signal @xcite impinging on the social dynamics .    at the opposite end of the spectrum ,",
    "economists have stressed the _ micro - motives _ that underlie individual behavior and the assumption of rationality .",
    "they have also emphasized the importance of going beyond models of global interaction and/or bilateral random matching , accounting for some local structure ( modeled as a social network ) in the pattern of influence or communication among agents . this literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an early survey ) has considered a number of quite different scenarios , ranging from those where agents just gather and refine information @xcite to contexts where , in addition , there is genuine strategic interaction among agents @xcite . despite the wide range of specific models considered , the literature largely conveys a striking conclusion : full social conformity is attained ( although not necessarily correct learning ) , irrespectively of the network architecture . on the other hand , to attain correct learning , one must require not only that the population be large but , in the limit , that no individual retain too much influence @xcite .",
    "the model studied in this paper displays some similarities to , as well as crucial differences with , those outlined above . to fix ideas , the model could be regarded as reflecting a situation where , despite the fact that new information keeps arriving throughout , the consequences of any decision",
    "can only be observed in the future .",
    "even more concretely , this could apply , for example , to the performance of a political candidate , the health consequences of consuming a particular good , or the severity of the problem of climate change , on all of which a flow of fresh information may be generated that is largely independent of agents evolving position on the issue .",
    "so , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the agents receive an external signal ; however , the signal is noisy and it is confronted with the behavior displayed by neighbors . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , while the agents make and adjust their choices , they keep receiving noisy signals on what is the best action .",
    "in contrast , however , these signals are not associated to experimentation . in this respect",
    ", we share with ref .",
    "@xcite the assumption that agents arrival of information is not tailored to current choices .    the problem , of course ,",
    "would become trivially uninteresting if agents either have unbounded memory or store information that is a sufficient statistic for the whole past ( e.g. updated beliefs in a bayesian setup ) .",
    "for , in this case , agents could eventually learn the best action by relying on their own information alone .",
    "this leads us to making the stylized assumption that the particular action currently adopted by each individual is the only  trace \" she ( and others ) keep of her past experience .",
    "thus her ensuing behavior can only be affected by the signal she receives and the range of behavior she observes ( i.e. , her own as well as her neighbors ) . under these conditions",
    ", it is natural to posit that if an agent receives a signal that suggests changing her current action , she will look for evidence supporting this change in the behavior she observes on the part of her neighbors . and then , only if a high enough fraction of these are adopting the alternative action , she will undertake the change .",
    "this , indeed , is the specific formulation of individual learning studied in the present paper , which is in the spirit of the many threshold models studied in the literature , such as @xcite .    in the setup outlined",
    ", it is intuitive that the  acceptance threshold \" that agents require to abandon the status quo should play a key role in the overall dynamics . and , indeed , we find that its effect is very sharp .",
    "first , note the obvious fact that if the threshold is either very high or very low , social learning ( or even behavioral convergence ) can not possibly occur .",
    "for , in the first case ( a very high threshold ) , the initial social configuration must remain frozen , while in the second case ( a very low threshold ) , the social process would enter into a state of persistent flux where agents keep changing their actions . in both of these polar situations , therefore , the fraction of agents choosing the good action would center around the probability @xmath0 with which the signal favors that action .    outside of these two polar situations , we find that there is always an intermediate region where social learning does occur . and , within this region , learning emerges abruptly .",
    "specifically , there are upper and lower bounds ( dependent on @xmath0 ) such that , if the threshold lies within these bounds , _ all _ agents learn to play the good action while _ no _ learning _ at all _ occurs if the threshold is outside that range . thus the three aforementioned regions are separated by sharp boundaries .",
    "a similar abruptness in learning arises as one considers changes in @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", there is a lower bound on @xmath0 ( which depends on the threshold ) such that , again , we have a binary situation ( i.e. , no learning or a complete one ) if the informativeness of the signal is respectively below or above that bound . in a sense , these stark conclusions highlight the importance of the social dimension in the learning process .",
    "they show that , when matters / parameters are  right , \" the process of social learning builds upon itself to produce the sharp changes just outlined .",
    "as it turns out , this same qualitative behavior is encountered in a wide variety of different network contexts . to understand the essential features at work , we start our analysis by studying the simple case of a complete graph , where every agent is linked to any other agent .",
    "this context allows one to get a clear theoretical grasp of the phenomenon .",
    "in particular , it allows us to characterize analytically the three different regimes of social learning indicated : correct learning , frozen behavior , or persistent flux .",
    "we then show that this characterization also provides a good qualitative description of the situation when the interaction among agents is mediated via a sparse complex network .",
    "we consider , in particular , three paradigmatic classes of networks : regular two - dimensional lattices , poisson random networks , and barabsi - albert scale free networks .",
    "for all these cases , we conduct numerical simulations and find a pattern analogous to the one observed for the complete graph .",
    "the interesting additional observation is that local interaction _ enlarges _ ( in contrast to global interaction ) the region where social learning occurs .",
    "in fact , this positive effect is mitigated as the average degree of the network grows , suggesting a positive role for relatively limited / local connectivity in furthering social learning .",
    "there is large population of agents , @xmath1 , placed on a given undirected network @xmath2 , where we write @xmath3 if there is link between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath6 .",
    "let time step @xmath7 be indexed discretely .",
    "each agent @xmath8 displays , at any time step @xmath9 , one of two alternative actions @xmath10 , which are not equivalent .",
    "one of them , say action @xmath11 , induces a higher ( expected ) payoff , but the agents do not know this .    at each time step @xmath9 ,",
    "one randomly chosen agent @xmath8 receives a signal on the relative payoff of the two actions .",
    "this signal , which is independent across time and agents , is only partially informative .",
    "specifically , it provides the correct information ( i.e. ,  action 1 is best \" ) with probability @xmath12 , while it delivers the opposite information with the complementary probability @xmath13 .",
    "if agent @xmath4 s previous action @xmath14 does not coincide with the action @xmath15 suggested as best , she considers whether changing to the latter .",
    "we assume that she chooses @xmath15 ( thus making @xmath16 ) if , and only if , the fraction of neighbors in @xmath17 who chose @xmath15 at @xmath18 exceeds a certain threshold . let this ( common ) threshold be denoted by @xmath19 $ ] .    at the start of the dynamic process",
    ", each agent receives one signal @xmath20 and adopts the corresponding action . in other words ,",
    "the initial condition for the process is one where each agent , independently , holds action @xmath21 with probability @xmath0 or action @xmath22 with probability @xmath13 .",

    "first , we consider the benchmark case of global interaction ( i.e. , a completely connected network )",
    ". then , we turn to the case of local interaction and focus on three paradigmatic network setups : lattice networks , erds - rnyi ( poisson ) networks , and barabsi - albert ( scale - free ) networks .      the results obtained on the completely connected network ( i.e. , the network where every pair of nodes is linked ) are in line with the theory presented in the previous section .",

    "intermediate situations appear as a continuous color grading between these two polar configurations .",
    "we find that , depending on the quality of the external signal @xmath0 and the threshold @xmath23 , the system reaches configurations where either complete learning occurs ( @xmath24 ) or not ( @xmath72 ) . indeed , the observed asymptotic behavior is exactly as predicted by the analysis of the previous section and it displays the following three phases :    * phase i : @xmath73 .",
    "the system reaches a stationary aggregate configuration where the nodes are continuously changing their state but the average fraction of those choosing action @xmath11 gravitates around the frequency @xmath74 with some fluctuations ( see figure  2_a _ ) .",
    "the magnitude of these fluctuations decreases with system size @xmath68 . *",
    "phase ii : @xmath75 .",
    "the system reaches the absorbing state @xmath24 where everyone adopts action @xmath11 .",
    "this is a situation where the whole population eventually learns that the correct choice is action @xmath11 ( see figure  2_b _ ) . *",
    "phase iii : @xmath76 .",
    "the system freezes in the initial state , so the fraction @xmath72 of agents choosing the correct action coincides with the fraction of those that received the corresponding signal at the start of the process ( see figure  2_c _ ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , while in phase i the theory predicts @xmath72 , any finite - size system must eventually reach an absorbing homogenous state due to fluctuations .",
    "thus , to understand the nature of the dynamics , we determine the average time @xmath77 that the system requires to reach such an absorbing state .",
    "as shown in figure  3 , @xmath77 grows exponentially with @xmath68 .",
    "this means that @xmath77 grows very fast with system size , and thus the coexistence predicted by the theory in phase i can be regarded as a good account of the situation even when @xmath68 is just moderately large .",
    "now assume that all nodes are placed on a _ regular boundariless lattice _ of dimension @xmath78 , endowed with the distance function @xmath79 given by @xmath80 .",

    "it is therefore interesting to explore whether any deviation from this rigid framework can affect our former conclusions .",
    "this we do here by focusing on two of the canonical models studied in the network literature : the early model of erds and rnyi ( er ) @xcite and the more recent scale - free model introduced by barabsi and albert ( ba ) @xcite . both of them abandon the regularity displayed by the lattice network and contemplate a non - degenerate distribution of node degrees .",

    "the newcomer selects its neighbors randomly , with the probability of attaching to each of the existing nodes being proportional to their degree @xmath111 .",
    "it is well known that this procedure generates networks whose degree distribution follows a power law of the form @xmath116 , with @xmath117 . for our simulations , we have constructed ba networks using this procedure and a value of @xmath118 , leading to an average degree @xmath119 .    .",

    "system size @xmath55 , average over @xmath27 realizations . ]",
    "the networks are constructed , therefore , so that they have the same average degree in both the er and ba contexts .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the degree distributions obtained in each case are markedly different . while in the former case",
    ", the degree distribution induces an exponentially decaying probability for high - degree nodes , in the latter case it leads to  fat tails \" , i.e. associates significant probability to high - degree nodes .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  6 .",
    "for the two alternative network topologies , the system displays qualitatively the same behavior found in the lattice network .",
    "that is , there are three distinct phases yielding distinct kinds of dynamic performance : convergence to action @xmath11 , frozen behavior , and persistent turnover .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that , compared with the case of global interaction , the convergence region ( which we labeled as phase ii before ) is significantly larger .",
    "this suggests that local ( i.e. limited ) connectivity facilitates social learning .    why does limited connectivity extend the learning region ? intuitively , the reason is that it enhances the positive role in learning played by random fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations are neglected , by construction , in the mean - field approximation and are also minimized when the whole population interacts globally .",
    "but , when interaction is local , those fluctuations will tend to de - stabilize the situation in both the constant flux and in the frozen phases  at first , locally , but then also globally .    to gain a more refined understanding of this issue ,",
    "let us try to assess the effect of local interaction on the likelihood that , at some random initial conditions , any given node faces a set of neighbors who favors a change of actions .",
    "this , of course , is just equal to the probability that the fraction of neighbors who display opposite behavior is higher than @xmath23 , the required threshold for change .",
    "thus , more generally , we want to focus on the conditional distribution densities @xmath120 and @xmath121 that specify , for an agent displaying actions @xmath11 and @xmath22 respectively , the probability density of finding a fraction @xmath122 of neighbors who adopt actions @xmath22 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "of course , these distributions must depend on the degree distribution of the network and , in particular , on its average degree . specifically , when the average degree of the network is large relative to population size ( thus we approximate a situation of global interaction ) those distributions must be highly concentrated around @xmath0 and @xmath123 respectively . instead , under lower connectivity ( and genuine local interaction ) , the distributions @xmath120 and @xmath121 will tend to be quite disperse .    next , let us understand what are the implications of each situation .",
    "in the first case , when the connectivity is high , the situation is essentially captured by a mean - field approximation , and thus the induced dynamics must be well described by the global interaction case ( in particular , as it concerns the size of the convergence region ) .",
    "in contrast , when the connectivity is low and the distributions @xmath120 and @xmath121 are disperse , a significant deviation from the mean - field theory is introduced . in fact , the nature of this deviation is different depending on the level of the threshold @xmath23 .",
    "if it is low , and thus action turnover high , it mitigates such turnover by increasing the probability that the fraction of neighbors with opposite behavior lie below @xmath23 . instead",
    ", if @xmath23 is high and action change is difficult , it renders it easier by increasing the probability that the fraction of neighbors with opposite behavior lies above @xmath23 .",
    "thus , in both cases it works against the forces that hamper social learning and thus improves the chances that it occurs .",
    "more precisely , the above considerations are illustrated in figure  7 for a lattice network . there",
    "we plot the distributions @xmath120 for different levels of connectivity @xmath111 and parameter values @xmath56 and @xmath124  recall that these values correspond to phase i ( with high turnover ) in a _ fully connected _ network .",
    "consider first the situation that arises for values of @xmath125  i.e. low connectivity relative to the size of the system .",
    "then we find that , among the nodes that are adopting action @xmath11 , @xmath126 attributes a significant probability mass to those agents whose fraction of neighbors @xmath127 choosing action @xmath22 is below the threshold required to change ( as marked by the vertical dashed line ) .",
    "such nodes , therefore , will not change their action . and ,",
    "as explained , this has the beneficial effect of limiting the extent of action turnover as compared with the global interaction setup . on the other hand",
    ", the inset of figure  7 shows that , among the nodes that are adopting action @xmath22 , the distribution @xmath128 associates a large probability mass to those agents whose fraction of neighbors @xmath122 choosing the opposite action is above @xmath23 .",
    "this ensures that there is a large enough flow from action @xmath22 to action @xmath11 . in conjunction , these two considerations lead to a situation that allows , first , for some limited nucleation around action @xmath11 to take place , followed by the ensuing spread of this action across the whole system ( figure  7(_b - d _ ) ) .",
    "let us now reconsider the former line of reasoning when @xmath111 is large  in particular , take the case @xmath129 depicted in figure  7 .",
    "then , the corresponding distribution @xmath126 is highly concentrated around @xmath130 , essentially all its probability mass associated to values that lie above @xmath124 .",
    "this means that the induced dynamics must be similar to that resulting from the complete - network setups , and thus too - fast turnover in action choice prevents the attainment of social learning .",
    "clearly , social learning would also fail to occur for such high value of @xmath111 if the threshold @xmath89 were large . in this case , however , the problem would be that the highly concentrated distributions @xmath126 and @xmath128 would have most of their probability mass lying below the threshold .",
    "this , in turn , would lead to the freezing of the initial conditions , which again is the behavior encountered for a complete network .     that a node using action @xmath11 has a fraction of neighbor nodes with action @xmath22 , computed on a two - dimensional lattice for @xmath87 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and a completely connected network ( from the broadest to the narrowest probability density distribution ) .",

    "the dashed line indicates the threshold @xmath135 ; parameter values : system size is @xmath26 , @xmath56 , and @xmath124 . ]",
    "the paper has studied a simple model of social learning with the following features .",
    "recurrently , agents receive an external ( informative ) signal on the relative merits of two actions . and , in that event , they switch to the action supported by the signal if , and only if , they find support for it among their peers - specifically , iff the fraction of these choosing that action lies above a certain threshold .",
    "given the quality of the signal , correct social learning occurs iff the threshold is within some intermediate region , i.e. neither too high nor too low . for , if it is too high , the situation freezes at the configuration shaped at the beginning of the process ; and if it is too low , the social dynamics enters into a process of continuous action turnover .",
    "a key conclusion is that social learning is a dichotomic phenomenon , i.e. it either occurs completely or not at all , depending on whether the threshold lies within or outside the aforementioned region .",
    "these same qualitative conclusions are obtained , analytically , in the case of global interaction  which corresponds to a mean - field version of the model  as well as , numerically , in a wide range of social networks : complete graphs , regular lattices , poisson random networks , and barabsi - albert scale - free networks .",
    "however , the size of the parameter region where social learning occurs depends on the pattern of social interaction . in general ,",
    "an interesting finding is that learning is enhanced ( i.e. the size of the region enlarged ) the less widespread is such interaction .",
    "this happens because genuinely local interaction favors a process of spatial nucleation and consolidation around the correct action , which can then spread to the whole population .    in sum ,",
    "a central point that transpires from our work is that , in contrast to what most of the received socio - economic literature suggests , social learning is hardly a forgone conclusion .",
    "this , of course , is in line with the common wisdom that , paraphrasing a usual phrase , crowds are not always wise . in our threshold framework",
    ", this insight is robust to the topology or density of social interaction .",
    "furthermore , our results highlight the importance of identifying the information diffusion mechanism , and the local sampling of the population provided by the social network .",
    "but future research should explore whether it is also robust to a number of important extensions .",
    "just to mention a few , these should include ( a ) interagent heterogeneity ",
    "e.g. in their individual thresholds for change ; ( b ) different behavioral rules ",
    "e.g. payoff - based imitation ; or ( c ) the possibility that agents adjust their links , so that learning co - evolves with the social network ."
