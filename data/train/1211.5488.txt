    "in the preface of the book @xcite , d.g .  kendall re - phrased a conjecture about the shape of planar tessellation cells having large area .",
    "he considered a stationary and isotropic poisson line tessellation in the plane and conjectured that the shape of the cell containing the origin is approximately circular if its area is large .",
    "first contributions to kendall s conjecture are due to goldmann @xcite , kovalenko @xcite and miles @xcite .",
    "the first result for higher dimensions is by mecke and osburg @xcite who considered what they call poisson cuboid tessellations . in a series of papers ,",
    "calka @xcite , calka and schreiber @xcite , hug , reitzner and schneider @xcite and hug and schneider @xcite treated very general higher - dimensional versions and variants of kendall s problem for quite general tessellation models ( poisson hyperplanes , poisson - voronoi and poisson - delaunay tessellations ) and size functionals , see also the book chapter @xcite for an overview .",
    "the respective results either rely on asymptotic theory for high - density boolean models or on sharp inequalities of isoperimetric type .    in this paper , we focus on the analysis of the shape of small tessellation cells .",
    "so far , we were not able to discover a general principle as the one mentioned above for the large cells behind the asymptotic geometry of small cells .",
    "for this reason , we restrict attention to the following simple model and its affine images .",
    "take two independent stationary ( homogeneous ) poisson point processes of unit intensity on the two coordinate axes in the plane and draw vertical lines through the points on the @xmath0-axis and horizontal lines through the points on the @xmath1-axis ; see figure [ figrect ] ( left ) .",
    "the collection of these lines ( without the two coordinate axes ) decomposes the plane into a countable number of non - overlapping rectangles , the collection of which is called a _ rectangular poisson line tessellation _ ; see @xcite",
    ". of interest in the present paper is the shape of a typical rectangle of the tessellation ( the precise definition follows below ) .",
    "mecke and osburg @xcite have shown that a typical rectangle tends to be ` more and more cubical as the area tends to infinity ' . in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the converse question and ask for the shape of a typical rectangle of small area .",
    "we will show that , in contrast to the large area case , the shape of typical rectangles with small area is asymptotically degenerate . besides rectangles of small area , we also consider rectangles that have small perimeter .",
    "for such a situation we obtain a uniform distribution for our parameter measuring the shape of the rectangles ( in fact not in general , but at least for the case described above ) . again , this result is in contrast to the large perimeter case indicated in @xcite ( with proofs given in @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to stress the fact that this is the first paper dealing with the mathematical analysis of small cells in random tessellations although some conjectures together with heuristic arguments have appeared earlier in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this text is structured as follows . in section [ sec : results ] we present the mathematical framework , the statements of our results , theorem [ thm1 ] and theorem [ thm : smallperimeter ] , a large scale simulation study as well as an outlook to higher space dimensions . sections",

    "we let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two different lines in @xmath4 and fix @xmath7 .",
    "on @xmath4 we define the probability measure @xmath8 by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 stands for the dirac measure concentrated at @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "this is to say , @xmath8 is concentrated on @xmath5 and @xmath6 with weights @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we also define the translation - invariant measure @xmath15 on @xmath2 by the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 stands for the lebesgue measure on @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a non - negative measurable function . in other words , @xmath15 is concentrated on two families of lines parallel to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whereas @xmath21 is an intensity parameter .",

    "@xcite for definitions .",
    "clearly , the lines of @xmath22 decompose the plane into countably many parallelograms  called _ cells _ in the sequel  which have pairwise no interior points in common ; see figure [ figrect ] ( right ) .",
    "the collection of all cells is denoted by @xmath23 and the intersection point of the two diagonals of a parallelogram @xmath24 is denoted by @xmath25 .",

    "the definition formalizes the idea of a uniformly selected cell from @xmath31 ( regardless of size and shape ) and we call a random parallelogram with distribution @xmath26 a _ typical cell _ of the tessellation ; cf .",
    "@xcite for background material .",
    "note that by definition the typical cell @xmath32 is centered in the origin , i.e. @xmath33 .    the following fact will turn out to be crucial for our further investigations .",

    "moreover , we have @xmath45 if exactly one of the edge lengths @xmath38 or @xmath39 is zero , i.e. , if the parallelogram degenerates in that it is a line segment of positive length . for single points , i.e. @xmath46 , @xmath44 is not defined . as a second deviation functional",
    "we introduce @xmath47 this is not a scale invariant quantity , but we notice that @xmath48 if and only if the parallelogram is degenerated to a point .    we investigate first the asymptotic behavior of the deviation functionals @xmath44 and @xmath49 under the condition that the typical cell area @xmath28 tends to zero .",

    "this phenomenon is well reflected in the simulation study presented in section [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "we also remark that gives an upper bound for the rate of convergence .    besides cells of small area , also cells with small perimeter can be considered . in this case",
    "the picture is somewhat different from that presented for the small area case in theorem [ thm1 ] . in what follows",

    "[ prop : kantenlaengenhoeherdimensional ] the edge lengths of a typical cell of a poisson cuboid tessellation induced by @xmath22 are independent and exponentially distributed random variables with parameters @xmath102 , respectively .    as a first step",

    "exactly one of these parallelepipeds , @xmath109 say , has the property that for all its corners the first coordinate is non - negative .",

    ", @xmath109 has ( again up to translations ) the same distribution as the typical cell of the poisson hyperplane tessellation induced by @xmath22 , see also section 4 in @xcite .",
    "note in particular that the random parallelepiped @xmath109 has one of its corners at the origin . in view of the construction of @xmath22 described at the beginning of the proof",
    ", this implies that the edge lengths of @xmath109 are the distances from the origin of @xmath107 independent and homogeneous poisson point processes on @xmath110 with intensities @xmath102 , respectively , to their next point on the left or right ( depending on the position of @xmath109 within @xmath106 ) .",
    "thus , standard properties of such point processes allow us to conclude that the edge - lengths of the typical parallelepiped are independent and exponentially distributed with parameters @xmath102 .",
    "we claim that without loss of generality we can restrict the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] to the case @xmath69 , @xmath57 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the two orthogonal coordinate axes . to show this ,",
    "let us denote such a tessellation by @xmath111 and a tessellation with general parameters @xmath112 , @xmath13 and @xmath8 by @xmath113 .",
    "we notice now that due to our assumptions on @xmath112 and @xmath13 there exists a non - degenerate linear transformation @xmath114 such that @xmath113 after application of @xmath115 has the same distribution as @xmath111 .",
    "we notice further that the images under @xmath115 of a parallelogram , a line segment and a point are again a parallelogram , a line segment and a point , respectively .",
    "thus , the statement of theorem [ thm1 ] is invariant under non - degenerate linear transformations of the underlying poisson line tessellation .",
    "this implies that it is sufficient to establish the statement for one special choice of @xmath112 , @xmath13 and @xmath8 , viz .",
    "@xmath111 .        to simplify the calculations we work from now on with @xmath116 and translate the result afterwards to the original deviation functional @xmath58 .",
    "to start with the calculation , we write the conditional probability as @xmath117 in what follows , we consider the numerator and the denominator separately . to deal with the numerator we have to consider the event @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath120 .",
    "the condition @xmath121 then becomes @xmath122 and implies @xmath123 .",
    "therefore @xmath124 has to apply to retain @xmath39 as the minimum . taking the second condition @xmath119 into account ,",
    "leads to @xmath125 as the upper bound for @xmath39 .",
    "considering the lower bound for @xmath39 , that is @xmath126 , we get the upper bound for @xmath38 from the condition @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the numerator can be written as @xmath128 the last expression can be determined by a straight forward integration procedure , which yields that asymptotically , as @xmath129 , it behaves like @xmath130 times a constant depending on @xmath131 ( the two logarithmic terms cancel out ) .",
    "using the substitution @xmath132 and @xmath133 we can write the denominator as @xmath134 applying the substitution @xmath135 and @xmath136 in the next step , we get @xmath137 now we split this double integral and calculate the resulting integrals directly as far as possible : @xmath138 even if the integral in looks rather innocent , its asymptotic behavior as @xmath129 turns out to be not accessible with elementary methods as above . to overcome this difficulty we make use of a theorem of abelian type .",
    "so , let @xmath139 and write @xmath140which arises by a shift @xmath141 , and use now a relation between the laplace transformation and the laplace - stieltjes transformation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3a ) to conclude from the theorem of abelian type ( * ? ? ?",

    "this leads to @xmath154 rearrangement then results in @xmath155 the term @xmath156 has already been discussed in the proof of above .",

    "defining @xmath159 we have that @xmath160 and can thus apply ( * ? ? ? * corollary 8.5.1 ) again , which gives that @xmath158 behaves asymptotically like @xmath161 , as @xmath129 .",
    "putting things together we see that the numerator , after differentiation , is bounded , whereas the denominator , again after differentiation , tends to @xmath162 as @xmath129 , implying that @xmath163 this completes the proof of .@xmath146",
    "applying the reduction step as in the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] is not possible here since the problem involving a small perimeter is not invariant under non - degenerate linear transformation .",
    "however , we can use proposition [ prop : kantenlaengen ] to give a direct proof .",
    "it implies that the random edge lengths @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the typical cell ( parallelogram ) are independent and identically distributed according to an exponential distribution with mean @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "if @xmath166 it follows that the half perimeter length @xmath54 is erlang distributed with parameters @xmath112 and @xmath43 . in fact this was the reason for the factor @xmath55 in the definition of @xmath167 .",
