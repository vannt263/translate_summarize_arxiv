    "in a bell experiment distant parties perform measurements on a shared physical system . from very reasonable assumptions",
    "it follows that the correlations between their results must satisfy certain inequalities .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts that often these bell inequalities will not be respected @xcite . their violation , which excludes all local realistic explanations for the quantum world , and which is often referred to as nonlocality , is one of the most surprising and counterintuitive features of quantum physics .",
    "one of the earliest experimental demonstrations of the bell violation were done by aspect _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , and many experiments on various systems have been performed since ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . unfortunately ,",
    "due to technical imperfections there are still loopholes , which in principle allow local realistic explanation for the experimental results .",
    "an important loophole , the so - called detection loophole appears in experiments performed on systems of photons  @xcite .",
    "some photons get lost during transmission and the efficiency of the present day photon detectors is also limited .",
    "if the proportion of photons detected falls below a certain critical value @xmath4 , which depends both on the bell inequality and on the system , then the results become compatible with local realism . as an important property characterizing the inequality and the system , vallone _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite introduced the notion of the robustness of nonlocality @xmath5 .",
    "they defined this quantity as the maximum fraction of detection events that can be lost such that the remaining ones still do not admit a local model .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath6 . in the present paper",
    "it will be assumed that the detection efficiency is the same for all parties .",
    "there are experiments , for example those involving entangled photon ",
    "ion systems , where some of the parties ( the ones working with the ions ) have virtually no loss of events .",
    "then the experiment tolerates higher losses for the remaining parties than in the symmetric case considered here  @xcite .",
    "another important loophole is the locality loophole , whose closure requires space - like separation between the parties .",
    "this can realistically be ensured only in bell tests performed on photon systems .",
    "each loophole has been closed by some experiment , but not all simultaneously , for example , no single experiment closed the locality and the detection loophole at the same time ( for a comprehensive review , see ref .",
    "such a verification would be interesting and fairly important from a philosophical point of view , although  as so many predictions of quantum mechanics has proven correct  at present virtually everyone is quite convinced that the bell violations observed so far are genuine , and not results of some conspiracy plotted by nature , using different loopholes in different situations to mislead us",
    ".    however , there are also practical reasons why loophole free bell violation would be important to achieve .",
    "bell violation is the basis of the so - called device independent protocols of quantum information technology ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "such protocols , based on the fact that bell violation is very hard to fake , would make it possible for anyone to check the proper functioning of an apparatus without knowing much about the details of its internal structure . therefore , construction faults would be easier to notice and it would be harder for a malicious manufacturer to build back doors into the device .",
    "this approach promises to perform cryptographic tasks with an unprecedented security  @xcite , produce genuinely random numbers  @xcite , and carry out black - box state tomography  @xcite .",
    "the violation of the simplest bell inequality , the two - party two - setting per party ( @xmath7 ) clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality  @xcite requires at least @xmath8 detection efficiency @xcite .",
    "this value may be reached with a partially entangled two qubit state , which approaches a product state near the threshold efficiency . in this case",
    "the robustness of nonlocality is @xmath9 . as far as we know , with two parties performing measurements on a pair of qubits",
    "no better value has been achieved . in ref.@xcite",
    "a bipartite four - setting inequality was found with a somewhat lower critical efficiency of @xmath10 . to get this value a pair of ququarts had to be used .",
    "larsson and semitecolos  @xcite have introduced a family of @xmath11 party binary bell inequalities with @xmath2 settings per party with @xmath12 .",
    "they have also proved that this value is optimal , no two - setting @xmath0-party bell inequality may be violated with any lower detection efficiency .",
    "this means that for @xmath2 an efficiency of less than @xmath13 is never enough .",
    "let @xmath14 be the smallest of the critical detection efficiencies belonging to the bell inequalities characterized by a certain number of parties and numbers of settings and measurement outcomes for each party .",
    "above @xmath14 there are quantum measurements exhibiting correlations that can not be explained by any local hidden variables model .",
    "the value for @xmath4 given by ref .",
    "@xcite and cited above is just @xmath14 for binary - outcome n - party two - setting per party bell inequalities . for @xmath0-party and more than two - setting per party ( @xmath3 ) inequalities @xmath14",
    "is not known .",
    "massar and pironio @xcite has given a lower bound for this quantity by constructing explicit local hidden variables models reproducing the correlations for efficiencies below this bound .",
    "for @xmath2 the bound is the same as the one of ref .  @xcite . based on combinatorial considerations buhrman _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite has derived an upper bound for @xmath14 , when @xmath15 is some power of two . ref .",
    "@xcite also provided upper bounds for many ( @xmath0,@xmath15 ) combinations ( @xmath15 prime ) by giving explicit bell inequalities corresponding to those efficiency values .",
    "the inequalities of that work may become useful in practice as well , because they require the greenberger ",
    "horne  zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite , very well distinguishable measurement settings even near the threshold efficiency , and",
    "the noise tolerance is also quite good .",
    "very recently tripartite bell inequalities have been constructed  @xcite requiring low detection efficiencies for their violation with the @xmath16 state  @xcite . with three measurement settings for one of the parties and two settings for the other two parties",
    "a critical efficiency of @xmath17 has been achieved .",
    "the same efficiency has been necessary for an inequality symmetric for the permutations of the parties with @xmath18 settings per party . for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "this value has been improved to @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . for larger @xmath15",
    "the construction would have required too much computational resources but the result would probably have remained above @xmath25 . however ,",
    "if a small admixture of a product state to the @xmath16 state has been allowed , @xmath26 has been found for an @xmath19 inequality .",
    "this value could not be improved by increasing @xmath15 .    in this work ,",
    "we have used an iterative procedure alternating a linear programming step and a semidefinite programming one to get the @xmath18 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 bell inequalities with the smallest possible @xmath4 . in this procedure",
    "we made assumption neither about the symmetry of the inequality nor about the properties of the state , not even about the dimensionality of the hilbert space .",
    "we have got tripartite inequalities reaching @xmath26 already with three settings per party , and for @xmath18 , @xmath28 we have obtained @xmath29 .",
    "we could get the same values with confining ourselves to permutationally symmetric inequalities .",
    "numerical calculations showed that the state giving the maximum violation near the threshold efficiency is a state of @xmath0 qubits , namely a mixture of the @xmath16 state and a product state that approaches the product state near @xmath4 , the same behavior as the one observed for the two - setting inequalities of larsson and semitecolos  @xcite .",
    "the measurement settings could be chosen the same for all parties .",
    "each measurement operator could be characterized by a single angle that approached zero at @xmath4 , but at different paces for the different settings , again similarly to what is seen in ref .",
    "these observations helped us to make the generalization and to define a whole family of bell inequalities with any @xmath15 and @xmath30 .",
    "the members of the family require the least detection efficiency for their violation among all known inequalities of the same type , giving upper bounds for @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath2 the inequalities are the same ( apart from swapping of the two measurement settings ) as the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ ineq ] , we give explicitly the family of multipartite bell expressions .",
    "then , in section  [ qviol ] , we give the optimal quantum violation of these bell inequalities with qubit systems accounting for finite detection efficiencies .",
    "our main result is presented in formula  ( [ eq : etacrit ] ) providing ( to the best of our knowledge ) the best upper bound on @xmath14 for any @xmath30 parties and @xmath15 settings per party .",
    "to get this formula , we have used two claims : one about the equality of certain quantum conditional probabilities and the negligibility of others , while the other concerning the classical bound .",
    "the first claim is proven in section  [ qcond ] , while the second one in section  [ class ] . to demonstrate the behavior of the relevant quantities , we highlight the example @xmath31 in section  [ 333 ] . here",
    ", we give the explicit bell expression and also show the optimal measurement settings ( angles ) and bell violation departing from the value of the critical detection efficiency .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider the bell scenario with @xmath0 distant observers .",
    "each observer may freely choose between a set of @xmath15 binary measurement settings with possible outcomes zero and one .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the @xmath33th measurement of the @xmath34th party .",
    "a bell inequality corresponding to this setup may be written as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the classical bound , and @xmath37 denotes the conditional probability of all parties getting outcome one given they have measured @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and so on .",
    "for the sake of brevity of the notation , for terms involving only a subset of observers , we have introduced a zeroth measurement whose outcome is always one , and which is always supposed to be performed .",
    "this measurement appears in these terms for the observers not members of the subset considered .",
    "the inequalities we introduce in the present paper are invariant with respect to the permutations of the parties , and @xmath40 holds .",
    "besides terms involving all @xmath0 observers , they contain only terms with @xmath41 parties ( that is terms containing equal or less than @xmath42 parties are zero ) . due to the permutational symmetry ,",
    "bell coefficients having the same set of indices in different orders have the same value .",
    "therefore , we only give explicit values for coefficients with indices @xmath43 .",
    "the nonzero @xmath44-party bell coefficients have the value of minus one .",
    "besides the index zero for the party not involved , they have indices from 2 to @xmath15 once , plus index @xmath15 another @xmath45 times if @xmath46 .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 and @xmath47 then @xmath48 , or if @xmath18 and @xmath49 then @xmath50 . for larger values of @xmath15",
    "the nonzero coefficients are @xmath51 and the ones we get by permuting the indices of the coefficients above .",
    "thus there are @xmath52 nonzero @xmath44-party coefficients .    furthermore , we have @xmath0-party bell coefficients whose value is positive .",
    "they are the ones that have the same set of indices as the nonzero @xmath44-party coefficients above , but index zero is replaced by anything from one to @xmath15 .",
    "if this index is @xmath15 , the value of the coefficient is @xmath53 , otherwise it is one .",
    "therefore , we may write ( again for larger @xmath15 ) @xmath54 again , all coefficients we get by permuting the indices have the same value .",
    "thus the first and the last line represent @xmath52 and @xmath55 coefficients , respectively , while the lines in between represent @xmath56 coefficients .",
    "there are also some @xmath0-party bell coefficients having negative values : @xmath57 where the indices are such that the quantum values of the conditional probabilities multiplying these coefficients calculated with the quantum state and the measurement operators we will give later are vanishingly small compared to the quantum conditional probabilities multiplying the coefficients given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nm1partycoeff ] ) and ( [ eq : npartycoeff ] ) .",
    "then the actual values of these coefficients will not influence the quantum value of the bell expression ( the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bellineq ] ) , therefore we may choose them freely . as we will show later",
    ", this freedom makes it possible to achieve that the classical bound @xmath36 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bellineq ] ) is zero , which is appropriate for our purpose .",
    "there are many solutions , and they all give the same value for the threshold detector efficiency .",
    "the maximum quantum violation above the threshold efficiency does depend on the actual choice , but we have made no attempt to find the best one .",
    "all other bell coefficients are zero .",
    "let us consider the quantum violation of our bell inequality . if we confine ourselves to von neumann measurements on a pure @xmath0-qubit state @xmath58 , the quantum value of the conditional probability appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bellineq ] ) may be written as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 for @xmath61 is the measurement operator corresponding to measurement @xmath32 , @xmath62 is the identity operator in the subspace of the observer , and @xmath63 denotes the tensor product of the operators of the parties .",
    "the state @xmath58 we consider in this paper is invariant with respect to the permutations of the parties , and all parties have the same set of measurement operators , that is @xmath64 is independent of @xmath34 .",
    "then , if the bell inequality of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bellineq ] ) is permutationally invariant and the classical bound is zero , the condition for its quantum violation can be written as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the number of independent permutations of its arguments .",
    "let of suppose that the observers have detectors of limited efficiency @xmath67 .",
    "let they agree that each of them signal outcome zero whenever the particle is not detected . in this case",
    "each term in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bellqviol ] ) must be multiplied by the probability of detecting all particles concerned to get the condition for the detection of the violation .",
    "this probability is @xmath68 for an @xmath69-party term , where @xmath69 is the number of nonzero indices . at the threshold efficiency",
    "@xmath4 the resulting expression is zero .",
    "this condition gives an @xmath0th order equation for @xmath4 . in our case",
    "the solution is simple , because we have restricted ourselves to @xmath0-party and @xmath44-party terms .",
    "the condition for being able to detect the violation is @xmath70 then @xmath4 is minus one times the ratio of the @xmath44-party and @xmath0-party contributions in the expression above .",
    "the former must be negative while the latter positive such that the left hand side is positive above @xmath4 .    in the next section",
    "we will show that with an appropriate choice of the state vector and the measurement settings , the quantum conditional probabilities associated with each bell coefficient given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nm1partycoeff ] ) and ( [ eq : npartycoeff ] ) are equal .",
    "as the same number appears both in the numerator and the denominator of the ratio giving @xmath4 , we can simplify with it .",
    "the factor @xmath71 giving the number of independent permutations of the indices is @xmath52 for the @xmath44-party coefficient and for the @xmath0-party coefficient given in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : npartycoeff ] ) .",
    "the factor is one half of this for the next @xmath72 coefficients , and it is @xmath55 for the last one . taking into account the values of the coefficients we can give the expression for @xmath4 as : @xmath73 here we have simplified the fraction by the common factor @xmath52 .",
    "this expression is our main result .",
    "our bell inequalities are such that their violation , at least in principle , can be detected by using detectors of as low efficiency as given above .",
    "therefore , this is an upper bound for the threshold detector efficiency which may be achieved for @xmath0-party @xmath1 setting binary outcome bell inequalities .",
    "the expression gives @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "however , if we increase @xmath0 , we can achieve less than by increasing both @xmath15 and @xmath0 by just one .    to prove eq .",
    "( [ eq : etacrit ] ) we must show that the relevant quantum conditional probabilities are really equal as we have claimed , and that the local bound is zero .",
    "we will do this in the next two sections .",
    "let all measurements be real ones , that is performed in the @xmath77 plane .",
    "then each operator @xmath78 can be characterized by a single real variable @xmath79 : @xmath80 a zero angle corresponds to the measurement giving outcome one with probability one for the @xmath81 state .",
    "let all measurement angles be small , and let they obey the following hierarchy : @xmath82 let the state be @xmath83 where @xmath84 will be small , therefore the state is predominantly the separable @xmath85 state with a very small amount of @xmath86 state added .",

    "we can achieve that by choosing the mixing angle @xmath99 characterizing the quantum state such that @xmath100 .",

    "we acknowledge financial support from the hungarian national research fund otka ( k111734 ) and a jnos bolyai grant of the hungarian academy of sciences .",
    "to prove the title of the appendix , let us consider the following bell inequality : @xmath213 where @xmath214 .",
    "we choose that both alice and bob always output  0 \" in case of non - detection , hence all measurements have binary outputs ( it turns out that other choices will not lead to lower detection efficiency thresholds ) .",
