    "we define a relic galaxy as an object that has been formed in the early phases of the universe ( i.e. z@xmath62 ) and which has remained unaltered ( i.e. without significant gas or stellar accretion ) since its initial formation .",
    "finding an object with these characteristics in the local universe would allow a detailed study of its assembly history , and significantly advance our understanding of the first steps in galaxy formation .",
    "the question then is how to identify one of these objects in our neighborhood .",
    "one obvious characteristic that these relic galaxies should have is that they must to be old along their entire structure and with no signs of star formation after its formation .",
    "in other words , their star formation history ( sfh ) should peak at the beginning of the universe and not show any activity later on .    among present - day galaxies ,",
    "the most promising candidates to be relics are the massive ellipticals .",
    "their sfhs are compatible with little or negligible star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) after their initial formation . however , their structures are very different ( i.e. their sizes have grown by a factor of @xmath104 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to the size of their likely progenitors at z@xmath62 , implying that they have assembled a significant fraction of their stars in the last 10 gyr .",
    "for this reason , if we want to find present - day galaxies which have remained unaltered since their initial formation at z@xmath62 , we have to search for current old massive galaxies which have the same structural properties than the population of massive galaxies at high - z .",
    "this is , finding old ( @xmath610 gyr ) , massive ( m@xmath3@xmath410@xmath0 m@xmath1 ) and compact ( r@xmath5@xmath21.5 kpc ) galaxies in our vicinity .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated the number density and the expected fraction of massive relic galaxies in our nearby ( z@xmath20.1 ) universe .",
    "they found that only @xmath100.1% of current massive galaxies are expected to have accreted less than @xmath1010% of their stars after their formation .",
    "this implies that the today number density of massive relics should be @xmath1010@xmath12mpc@xmath13 .",
    "these figures are small , but thanks to large area surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) we should be able to find @xmath1060 massive relics down to z=0.1 ( in the 8032 square degree covered by the spectroscopic sdss legacy dr7 ) .",
    "searches for massive compact galaxies in the nearby universe have found some ( although less than expected ) candidates to be relic objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but it turned out that these galaxies are surprisingly young ( @xmath102 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is unclear whether the absence of relics in the sdss legacy footprint could be related to spectroscopic incompleteness in some particular areas of the sky .",
    "for instance , in rich galaxy clusters , the spatial proximity of the galaxies could have prevented a proper spectroscopic coverage of the targets .",
    "the object that we explore in this paper , ngc1277 , is located at 73 mpc in the perseus galaxy cluster .",
    "this cluster is outside the sdss dr7 legacy coverage .",
    "however , this field was targeted by an exploratory survey for preparing the sdss segue program .",
    "ngc1277 has recently received a lot of attention due to the claim by @xcite that this object has an extraordinary large supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "interestingly , ngc1277 is massive ( m@xmath3=1.2@xmath70.4@xmath1410@xmath0 m@xmath1 ) and compact ( r@xmath5=1.2 kpc ) , two of the three properties we request for a massive galaxy to be a relic .",
    "this letter explores the third condition for being a relic galaxy and presents a detailed analysis of the sfh of ngc1277 along its global structure .",
    "the sdss spectrum of this galaxy is insuficient for this purpose as it only covers its inner 0.5 kpc .",
    "we use our own very deep spectroscopy to perform a stellar population analysis out to @xmath103r@xmath15 .",
    "ngc1277 is uniformly old , which makes it a strong candidate to be a relic galaxy .    throughout",
    "we adopt a standard cosmological model with the following parameters : @xmath16=70 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18=0.3 and @xmath19=0.7 .",
    "the redshift adopted here for ngc1277 , z=0.0169 , corresponds to a galaxy distance of 73.3 mpc and to a spatial scale of 344 pc / arcsec .",
    "the stellar mass density profile of ngc1277 as well as the high resolution imaging of the galaxy have been obtained using the wfc acs f625w ( sloan r ) filter from the nasa / esa hubble space telescope ( hst ) archive .",
    "these observations are associated with the program go:10546 ( pi : fabian ) .",
    "the pixel scale of this image is 0.05  and the point spread function full width at half maximum is 0.1  .",
    "the photometric zeropoint is 25.893 ( ab system ) .",
    "figure 1 shows an image of this galaxy in the f625w band .",
    "we obtained deep long - slit spectra employing the isis spectrograph on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "the blue grating r300b was centered at 5300@xmath20 with a @xmath142 binning in the spatial direction and the 1  slit was placed along the galaxy s major axis ( p.a.=96 degrees ) .",
    "this setup provided a spectral resolution of 3.4@xmath20 .",
    "seeing was 0.7  during the observations .",
    "six exposures of 30 minutes were taken , giving a total time on source of 3h .",
    "two spectrophotometric stars were observed with the same configuration to correct the shape of the spectra .",
    "data reduction was performed with reduceme @xcite , a package optimized for long - slit spectroscopy that allows a parallel treatment of the scientific data and the errors propagated through the process .",
    "this reduction process included a bias subtraction , flat - fielding , cosmic - ray removal , c- and s - distortion correction , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction and flux calibration .",
    "the result is a high quality spectrum ( averaged central s / n@xmath6150 ) that covers the wavelength range @xmath213400 - 6200@xmath20 .",
    "this coverage is optimal as it encompasses most of the line - strength indices employed in stellar population analysis and is also wide enough for the full - spectral - fitting technique in which this exercise is mostly based on .",
    "one of the conditions that we demand of a relic galaxy is to show no signatures ( i.e. tidal tails , asymmetries , etc ) of present or past interactions . in the case of ngc1277",
    "this analysis is complicated due to the presence of two galaxies aligned near our object ( fig.1 , left panel ) .",
    "consequently , in order to study potential faint evidence of interactions , we have substracted the light contamination from those galaxies .",
    "we have modeled and subtracted the light of the two intervening galaxies using the iraf task ellipse @xcite .    the clean image of ngc1277 is shown in fig .",
    "1 , right panel . we see no tidal signatures down to the surface brightness limit of this image ( @xmath1026.8 mag / arcsec@xmath22 ; r - band ) .",
    "in fact , ngc1277 looks very regular along its entire structure .",
    "a conservative estimation suggests that the above surface brightness limit implies that any potentially `` hidden '' disrupted satellite around ngc1277 would contribute with less than 2% to the mass of the galaxy .",
    "for this reason , we conclude that ngc1277 does not present signs of being currently ( or in its inmediate past ) accreting external stars .      the second evidence to conclude that ngc1277 has the structural characteristics of the primitive massive galaxies is given by its stellar mass density profile .",
    "although our galaxy is clearly elongated , the mass density profiles of the galaxies which we have used in our control samples , both at low and high - z ( see next paragraph ) , were obtained using circular apertures .",
    "for this reason , to make a fair comparison with those control galaxies , we have obtained the surface brightness profile of our galaxy using circular apertures .",
    "once we have the f625w ( r - band ) surface brightness profile , we have created the stellar mass density profile of the galaxy assuming that there are not stellar population gradients through its entire structure .",
    "this approximation is reasonable according to the information provided by the deep spectra we will show in the next subsection . using the age and metallicity from our analysis of the galaxy spectra",
    "( 12 gyr and 0.2 dex respectively ; see below ) , we have obtained a m / l of 4.438 ( r - band ) which we use to build the stellar mass density profile ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 , we show the comparison of the stellar mass density profile of ngc1277 with the stellar mass density profiles of `` normal - sized '' massive galaxies from the sdss survey . to build the stellar mass density profiles of the `` normal - sized '' galaxies , we took the structural parameters ( srsic index n , effective radius r@xmath5 , and stellar mass m@xmath3 ) of all the galaxies in the nyu catalog @xcite with 0.8@xmath23m@xmath3@xmath231.2@xmath1410@xmath0m@xmath24 and 0.08@xmath23z@xmath230.12 . to facilitate the comparison with our profiles",
    ", we divided the nyu galaxies into two different categories : disk - like ( n@xmath232.5 ) and spheroid - like ( n@xmath62.5 ) .",
    "we find that the average disk - like massive galaxy within the nyu sample at those redshifts has m@xmath3=0.92@xmath1410@xmath0m@xmath24 , n=2.2 , and r@xmath5=5.0 kpc . on the other hand , the average spheroid - like object has m@xmath3=0.95@xmath1410@xmath0m@xmath24 , n=4.0 , and r@xmath5 = 4.7 kpc .",
    "once we obtained these average galaxy profiles , the representative regions of each galaxy category were build using all the galaxies in the nyu sample within the above stellar mass range and redshift interval whose central stellar mass densities were within 68% of the distribution centered around the mean value .    neither",
    "present - day massive `` normal - sized '' spiral - like nor elliptical - like galaxies have similar stellar mass density profiles to the one shows by ngc1277 .",
    "ngc1277 has a denser profile in the inner 1 kpc ( being a factor 2 - 3 denser than the present - day densest elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass ) . in the outer region , beyond 4 kpc , ngc1277 is underdense compared to the normal population of massive galaxies .",
    "however , when we compare ( see fig . 2 right panel )",
    "the stellar mass density profile of ngc1277 with the massive compact galaxies found at high - z @xcite or with the young compact massive galaxies found at z@xmath100.15 @xcite , the agreement between both profiles is remarkable .",
    "we conclude that the detailed structural properties of ngc1277 are equivalent to the ones found in the primitive universe for massive galaxies with similar stellar mass .      the final evidence for considering that ngc1277 is a relic galaxy comes from a detailed analysis of its spectra along its major axis ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in the upper panel of this figure",
    ", we present the spectra of the galaxy at different radial distances .",
    "the depth of our exposure allows us to explore the stellar population properties of our galaxy down to 3r@xmath5 with a s /",
    "n above 20 ( our limit to ensure that we have enough quality to get reliable sfhs ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sfhs of ngc1277 along its radial distance have been obtained using a full - spectral - fitting approach .",
    "we have employed the extended version of miles stellar population synthesis models @xcite miuscat @xcite and we have fed the full - spectral - fitting code starlight @xcite with them in order to recover the sfh of this galaxy .",
    "the models cover a wide range of both ages ( 0.1 - 17.8gyr ) and metallicities ( -1.71 to 0.22 ) and they also allow for variations on the imf slope and shape . for the purpose of this exercise , we have focused on the standard assumption of a kroupa universal imf , although we have also studied the impact on changing the imf @xcite according to the velocity dispersion , as recently claimed by several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we have found that our results remain unaltered .",
    "in addition , the same study was carried out with another different spectral - fitting code , steckmap @xcite to ensure the robustness of the method , rendering similar results .",
    "we therefore derive the mean age and mean metallicity and the sfh for each one of the radial binnings out to 3r@xmath5 ( both luminosity and mass - weighted ) .",
    "figure3 lower panels show the derived mass - weighted sfh for 4 of the apertures .",
    "it is clear that all the stars in this object were formed at high - redshift , being most of them older than 10gyr .",
    "in fact , this remains true even out to large galactocentric distances , as we present in figure4 , where the radial profiles for the mass - weighted age ( top ) and metallicity ( middle panel ) are shown . according to the analysis done with starlight",
    ", ngc1277 is an old object ( @xmath1012gyr ) with a high total metallicity down to at least 3r@xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to a radial distance which encloses 85% of the total light of this object @xcite assuming a global srsic index of n=2.2 for this galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sfh , age and metallicity profiles obtained with a full - spectral - fitting approach , the middle and lower panel in fig . 4 presents the radial variation of the metallicity and the @xmath8/fe parameter , which is a good estimator of how fast a galaxy forms its stars @xcite using line strength indices .",
    "this metallicity profile has been estimated using a hybrid approach which combines the luminosity weighted age derived from starlight versus the [ mgfe] index .",
    "this metallicity gradient shows similar values in the inner region than the one purely based on starlight .",
    "both metallicity profiles seems to indicate a smooth decline towards lower metallicities in the outer parts ngc1277 .    to estimate the @xmath8/fe gradient ,",
    "since the miuscat models are scaled solar around the solar metallicity , we employ the approach shown in @xcite . we have first derived two independent metallicity estimates from the pair of spectral indices h@xmath25-mgb@xmath26 and h@xmath25-@xmath23fe@xmath6 * ( a combined fe index ;",
    "* ) , z@xmath27 and z@xmath28 respectively .",
    "the difference between these two metallicities is a good solar proxy [ z@xmath27/z@xmath28 ] and has been shown to tigthly correlate with the @xmath8-enhanced ssp models of @xcite .",
    "we have found [ z@xmath27/z@xmath28]@xmath100.7 in our spectra , which translates into [ @xmath8/fe]@xmath100.4 .",
    "note that an extrapolation has been made when employing the model grid corresponding to the mgb index ( see also fig .",
    "5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore these values should be taken with some caveats .",
    "nonetheless , such very high values indicate that the bulk of the stellar populations of this object , which are very old , was formed in a very short period of time , almost resembling a single - burst event .",
    "in fact , according to the calibration provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their eq .",
    "2 ) between the time needed to form half of the final stellar mass of the galaxy , t@xmath30 , and @xmath8/fe , ngc1277 formed its mass in less than a few hundred myrs . for comparison ,",
    "a normal - sized massive galaxy with @xmath8/fe=0.25 , has t@xmath30=1.4 gyr .",
    "in other words , ngc1277 seems to have formed its stellar mass much faster than `` normal - sized '' galaxies with equal mass .",
    "such short time scales suggest star formation rates as high as @xmath101000 m@xmath1/yr for forming the bulk of the stars of ngc1277 .",
    "these high star formation rates have been measured in massive high - z galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have presented three strong evidences that suggest that ngc1277 is a relic galaxy .",
    "it is massive and compact , with no signature of interactions , it has exactly the same stellar mass density profile than the massive compact galaxies at high - z , and finally its stellar populations are compatible with having been formed very fast and more than 10 gyr ago .",
    "consequently , it is worth exploring its other properties to learn about the physical conditions at the formation of the massive galaxies in the early universe .",
    "no doubt , one of the most remarkable claims about ngc1277 is the presence of an over - massive blackhole in its center @xcite .",
    "the exact mass of this smbh is controversial , with claims that range from @xmath102@xmath1410@xmath31m@xmath24 to more modest ( but still a factor of @xmath104 larger than the expectation for the mass of this galaxy ) values as @xmath102@xmath1410@xmath32m@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "one is tempted to claim that the reason why this smbh is much larger than what it is expected is the absence of further growth in mass of its host galaxy after its initial assembly . in fact , an object with the characteristics of ngc1277 is expected to double its mass since z@xmath102 due to major and minor ( dry ) merging @xcite .",
    "this accreted stellar mass is mainly deposited in the outer region of the galaxies without feeding with new gas the central smbh .",
    "for this reason , if ngc1277 had followed the normal growth path expected for this type of galaxies , it would have had a more `` normal '' smbh .",
    "if this picture is correct , it seems reasonable to suggest that the smbhs ( at least for the most massive galaxies ) were formed together with the bulk of the stars of their host galaxies in a very fast collapse at high - z .",
    "after that , the smbhs have remained unchanged in mass while the mass of the host galaxies have continued growing by successive merging .",
    "it would be worth exploring whether the peculiar evolutionary path followed by ngc1277 was dictated by its location in a rich cluster as perseus .",
    "the morphology and internal dynamics of ngc1277 are also interesting .",
    "visually , ngc1277 has been classified as a peculiar s0 @xcite .",
    "in fact , its elongated shape resembles such morphology .",
    "it is worth noting that high ellipticity is common among massive compact galaxies , both at high - z ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and at z@xmath100.15 @xcite",
    ". finally , in relation to the dynamics of ngc1277 it is worth mentioning the high central velocity dispersion ( 333 km / s ) as well as its fast rotation ( @xmath10300 km / s ) measured along its major axis @xcite . to go further in the dynamical analysis , and also to address better the morphology of ngc1277 , is necessary to explore the dynamics of this object with 3d spectroscopy . at this moment , with the information along the major axis , we can only speculate .",
    "if this galaxy was in fact formed in a very fast event , we can think that the dynamics of its most inner region could resemble the turbulent and chaotic motions of the shocks of enormous cold flows triggering the star formation in its center .",
    "its fast rotation also could be related to the compact structure of ngc1277 .",
    "the angular momentum conservation could have transformed an original modest rotational velocity of the infalling gas cloud into the high values we observe now for ngc1277 outer stars .",
    "finally , if the theoretical predictions by @xcite are correct , one would expect to find only a single relic galaxy every 10@xmath33 mpc@xmath34 .",
    "it turns out that this number is very close to the volume enclosed by a sphere with a radius of 73 mpc ( @xmath101.6@xmath1410@xmath33 mpc@xmath34 ) .",
    "this again points out to the unique nature of ngc1277 .",
    "/fe profiles of ngc1277 .",
    "the figure shows the mean mass - weighted age and total metallicity derived using starlight .",
    "an independent measured of the metallicity and @xmath8/fe was obtained from an indices analysis .",
    "the profiles show a small change of the stellar population properties of this relic galaxy across its structure out to 3r@xmath5 .",
    "it seems that the entire galaxy was formed in a unique , very fast event , which produced the high @xmath8/fe abundances . ]",
