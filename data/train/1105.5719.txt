    "many astrophysical observations have confirmed the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , which contributes to roughly @xmath4 of the energy density of the universe . among many proposed dm candidates , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite are popular proposals since they are theoretically well motivated and also capable of producing the correct relic density .",
    "wimps could annihilate or decay into particles such as electrons , positrons , protons , antiprotons , photons , and neutrinos .",
    "it is possible to establish the wimp signature through detecting these particles @xcite .",
    "research activities on wimps have been boosted recently in efforts of explaining the observed anomalous positron excess in the data of pamela @xcite and positron plus electron excess in the data of fermi @xcite . to account for spectral shapes observed by these experiments",
    ", wimps must annihilate or decay mostly into leptons in order to avoid the overproduction of antiprotons .",
    "this could indicate that dm particles are leptophilic in their annihilations or decays @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the observation of neutrinos can give stringent constraints on the above scenario .",
    "measurements of upward going muons by super - kamiokande observatory place a limit on the galactic muon neutrino flux , which in turn rules out the possibility of wimp annihilations to @xmath5 as a source of @xmath6 anomalies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one expects that the possibilities of wimp annihilations into @xmath7 , and wimp decays into @xmath7 and @xmath8 will all be stringently constrained @xcite(see also discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite ) by the data from icecube detector augmented with deepcore array .",
    "the deepcore array @xcite is located in the deep center region of icecube detector .",
    "this array consists of @xmath9 densely instrumented strings plus 7 nearest standard icecube strings .",
    "the installation of deepcore array significantly improves the rejection of downward going atmospheric muons in icecube and lowers the threshold energy for detecting muon track or cascade events to about @xmath10 gev . as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the low detection threshold of deepcore array is achieved by three improvements over the icecube detector .",
    "first , the photo - sensors in deepcore are more densely instrumented than those of icecube , as just mentioned .",
    "second , the ice surrounding the deepcore array is on average twice as clear as the average ice above 2000 m @xcite .",
    "such a property is useful for reconstructing lower- energy neutrino events .",
    "finally the deepcore array uses new type of phototube which has a higher quantum efficiency .",
    "it is clear that deepcore array improves the sensitivity as well as enlarges the energy window for observing neutrinos from dm annihilations or decays in the galactic halo .",
    "previous analyses on the detection of these neutrinos in deepcore @xcite have set the threshold energy at @xmath11 gev for both track and cascade events . for neutrino events with energies higher than @xmath1 gev ,",
    "the estimation of atmospheric background event rate is straightforward since oscillation effects can be neglected .",
    "however , to take the full advantage of deepcore array , it is desirable to estimate the track and shower event rates due to atmospheric neutrinos in the energy range @xmath12 . in this energy range ,",
    "the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos can not be neglected . in this article , we take into account this oscillation effect and calculate the track event rate with a threshold energy @xmath13 gev due to atmospheric muon neutrinos from all zenith angles . given such a background event rate , we then evaluate the sensitivities of deepcore array to the neutrino flux arising from dm annihilations and decays in the galactic halo .",
    "in the subsequent paper , we shall analyze the corresponding sensitivities associated with cascade events .",
    "this paper will focus on neutrino signature induced by low - mass dm .",
    "hence our interested dm mass range is far below tev level implied by pamela and fermi data .",
    "therefore we shall consider neutrino flux induced by dm annihilations / decays into both leptons and hadrons .",
    "specifically , we consider the channels @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for annihilations and the channels @xmath16 and @xmath15 for decays .",
    "since we are only interested in low - mass dark matter , we have neglected neutrino fluxes generated through dm annihilations or decays into @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 final states .",
    "we also neglect neutrino fluxes arising from light meson decays , as the annihilation cross section for @xmath20 is likely to be suppressed by @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we shall compare the constraints on dm annihilation cross section and dm decay time for different values of threshold energy @xmath22 .",
    "for such a comparison , we employ the modes @xmath23 and @xmath24 for illustrations .",

    "@xmath69 at the source , and consequently the relation @xmath70 always holds due to the probability conservation , irrespective of the form of oscillation probability matrix .",

    "<S> the deployment of deepcore array significantly lowers icecube s energy threshold to about @xmath0 gev and enhances the sensitivity of detecting neutrinos from annihilations and decays of light dark matter . to match this experimental development , we calculate the track event rate in deepcore array due to neutrino flux produced by annihilations and decays of galactic dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the background event rate due to atmospheric neutrino flux for evaluating the sensitivity of deepcore array to galactic dark matter signatures . unlike previous approaches , which set the energy threshold for track events at around @xmath1 gev ( this choice avoids the necessity of including oscillation effect in the estimation of atmospheric background event rate ) , we have set the energy threshold at @xmath0 gev to take the full advantage of deepcore array . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our calculated sensitivity with those obtained by setting the threshold energy at @xmath1 gev . </S>",
