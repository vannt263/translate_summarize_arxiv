    "the existence of @xmath0-tetragonal ( @xmath0-t ) boron has long been a controversial issue .",
    "historically , @xmath0-t boron was first isolated in 1943 @xcite , and tentatively identified as b@xmath9 , which is composed of four tetrahedrally coordinated b@xmath10 icosahedra and two interstitial b atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : struct]).@xcite but soon this structural model was doubted by theorists .",
    "longuet - higgins and roberts showed that the b@xmath9 structure is unstable due to electron deficiency.@xcite later , experimental groups showed that the actual crystals contained c or n atoms @xcite and the chemical compositions were approximately b@xmath9n@xmath11 or b@xmath9c@xmath11 .",
    "this point of view was further supported by dft calculations.@xcite since then , it is almost generally accepted that pure @xmath0-t form does not exist and that the structure is stabilized only by inclusion of foreign atoms .    in the 2000 s , nanostructures were repeatedly reported to have the structure of pure @xmath0-t boron.@xcite hayami and otani explained the existence of pure @xmath0-t boron in nanostructures by the presence of low surface energies.@xcite subsequently , they predicted the possibility of pure @xmath0-t boron bulk structures with the composition b@xmath2.@xcite after this theoretical work , the high - pressure syntheses of bulk @xmath0-t boron were reported by several groups @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the prediction by hayami and otani , many different forms of tetragonal boron were discovered , including a known form of @xmath1-tetragonal boron @xcite .",
    "the current situation occurs to be rather complicated and many questions are raised : does pure @xmath0-t boron truly exists ? and if it does , what stabilizes its structure and what was wrong with the previous theory ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer these questions .    to say it shortly ,",
    "the qualitative argument of longuet - higgins and roberts is not wrong .",
    "the structure of b@xmath9 is indeed not stable .",
    "however , there are ingenious ways to circumvent this instability.@xcite one way is a deviation from stoichiometry . a suitable deviation from stoichiometry can lead to complete valence band filling and thus stabilize the structure of a covalent crystal .",
    "this explanation however raises a new question : why was pure @xmath0-t boron not found in bulk phases until recently ? a simple answer is that there are other phases which are more stable at ambient conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0- and @xmath1-rhombohedral ( @xmath0-r and @xmath1-r ) boron .",
    "however , the relative stability of these polymorphs can be changed at high pressures , which is a different way for stabilizing @xmath0-t boron . to clarify the relative stability of boron phases , a detailed comparison is required , which will be addressed in another study . here , we concentrate on @xmath0-t boron , only and identify the best structure that pure @xmath0-t boron can have , if it exists .",
    "there are several theoretical studies on the structure of @xmath0-t boron.@xcite however , these studies assumed stoichiometry . from our point of view @xcite , this assumption leads to an incorrect description of the metal / insulator behavior .",
    "the important role of non - stoichiometry has been recognized only recently and it will therefore be described in sec .  [",
    "sec : background ] .",
    "some words are also given there concerning the terminologies related to defect states , because they are used differently in different fields of science .",
    "this section also provides an overview and analysis of recent experiments , which is necessary because the current situation is very complicated . through this analysis , we are able to delineate a clear approach for identifying pure @xmath0-t boron . after describing the calculation method ( sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] ) , the article studies the electronic structures of individual interstitial sites ( is ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : bondnature ] . by considering all the involved is , the driving force for the deviation from stoichiometry is clarified in sec .",
    "[ sec : supercell ] . based on this analysis ,",
    "a deviation is predicted for various synthesis conditions ( sec .  [",
    "sec : high - pressure ] ) .",
    "an assessment on the characterization of recently discovered @xmath0-t boron is attempted in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice - para ] . behind the deviation from stoichiometry",
    ", we can say more about why @xmath0-t boron is not satisfied with a simple structure b@xmath2 . section [ sec : frustration ]",
    "is devoted to discuss this topics from a view point of geometrical frustration .",
    "in the last section , we summarize our results .",
    "for a long time solid - state theory of boron crystals had a fundamental problem .",
    "for many boron - rich crystals , band structure calculations showed metallic behavior , whereas in experiments all the crystals were found to be semiconductors .",
    "we call this problem the _ metal / insulator _ problem",
    ". table [ tbl : stoichiometry ] summarizes this discrepancy .",
    "this table is adapted from a paper of r. schmechel and h. werheit @xcite , who first pointed out the importance of deviation from stoichiometry for the metal / insulator problem .",
    "the last entry of the table corresponds to @xmath0-t boron , where for convenience the conclusion of this study is already given .",
    "we can notice in this table that , whenever the metal / insulator problem occurs , deviation from stoichiometry is observed . in boron - rich solids , the crystals",
    "are composed of a regular arrangement of icosahedra and various kinds of atoms at interstitial sites . those interstitial sites are either fully occupied sites ( fos ) or partially occupied sites ( pos ) .",
    "the deviation from stoichiometry is a result of the presence of pos .",
    ".a comparison of hypothetical ( theoretically considered ) and real structures of boron - rich solids . for most systems",
    "theory was unable to correctly predict their semiconducting properties ( second column ) .",
    "the experimentally determined electronic properties are given in the last column .",
    "for the real structures , some ground - state properties are indicated , such as high- or low - symmetry ( h - sym./l - sym . ) and stoichiometric or non - stoichiometric compositions ( st./nst . ) .",
    "the experimentally determined electronic properties are given in the last column .",
    "@xmath12 is the number of atoms per unit cell .",
    "odd numbers of electrons @xmath13 are indicated by italicized numbers .",
    "the last entry of this table contains our conclusion about the structure of @xmath0-t boron , that is presented in this article . [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,^,>,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : entropy ]    let us now proceed with a more elaborate estimate of the residual entropy .",
    "at high temperatures at which the @xmath0-t boron crystals are synthesized , many pos appear , non - stoichiometric systems are formed ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : high - pressure ] ) , and the configurational entropy increases .",
    "we estimate the configurational entropy @xmath14 by using the following formula , @xmath15 ,    \\label{eq : entropy}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the occupancy of the is @xmath17 . by using this formula",
    ", it is implied that all the is are independent .",
    "experimental values of occupancies for @xmath1-r boron by slack _",
    "et al _ @xcite and our calculated values for @xmath0-t boron are compared in table  [ tab : entropy ] . from these values , we obtain @xmath14 = 0.137 for @xmath1-r boron and @xmath14 = 0.128 for @xmath0-t boron .",
    "so the configurational entropy of @xmath0-t boron is comparable to that of @xmath1-r boron .",
    "on one hand this is an unexpected result , because the deviation from stoichiometry in @xmath0-t boron is only small . on the other hand",
    "it is actually reasonable , because the numbers of equivalent sites ( the multiplicity @xmath18 ) is bigger in @xmath0-t boron ( mostly 8) than in @xmath1-r boron ( mostly 6 ) .",
    "moreover , the number of atoms per unit cell in @xmath1-r boron is twice as large as that in @xmath0-t boron .",
    "based on these arguments , @xmath0-t boron can be considered as a new member of the group geometrical frustrated boron systems , because ( i ) an unavoidable conflict between the elimination of the existing unoccupied states and the creation of new unoccupied states , and ( ii ) the existing of a macroscopic amount of residual entropy .",
    "an interesting point is that the geometrical frustration of @xmath0-t boron does not require non - stoichiometry , differently from the situation in @xmath1-r boron .",
    "this makes the theoretical analysis simpler .",
    "recently , a novel view , the so - called _ correlated disorder _ has appeared , which is a universal approach connecting different classes of disorders , that is , frustrated over - constraint and configurational under - constraint.@xcite the structure of @xmath0-t boron is a particularly a good system for developing this view , because the structure seems to have both characters of disorder in it , because there is no way to perfectly satisfy covalent conditions ( over- constraint ) and there are many ways of arranging pos ( under - constraint ) .",
    "we have examined the possibility of the existence of non - stoichiometric , pure @xmath0-t boron .",
    "supercell calculations have shown that the lowest - energy state of pure @xmath0-t boron , if it exists , is the stoichiometric b@xmath2 with two occupied @xmath3 sites .",
    "therefore , a deviation from stoichiometry occurs only by entropic effects at high temperatures .",
    "this is different from @xmath1-r boron , where non - stoichiometry is a property of the lowest - energy state .",
    "this difference essentially comes from the fact that b@xmath2 has an even number of electrons and therefore the driving force for a deviation from stoichiometry is relatively weak .",
    "finite temperatures cause a deviation from stoichiometry b@xmath5 by a small positive amount , with @xmath3 site atoms as the main interstitial species . for high - pressure and high - temperature synthesis under reported conditions ,",
    "@xmath4 is estimated to be around @xmath4=0.1 to 0.2 .",
    "the present results on the site occupancies , the @xmath4 values as a function of pressure and temperature , and the lattice parameters provide a good test for the experimental identification of pure @xmath0-t boron .",
    "the dominant interstitial site of the pure form is @xmath3 , while for c- or n - containing forms the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 sites are favored . judging from the limited experimental data ,",
    "we conclude that ekimov s @xmath0-t boron is probably not a pure form , because of its negative @xmath4 together with other inconsistencies . judging from the lattice parameters , other recently discovered @xmath0-t boron forms",
    "could indeed be pure ones , though not all .",
    "for a final conclusion , however , more detailed information about the chemical composition and the site occupancies are required .    despite of b@xmath9 + 2b@xmath19 having a band gap ,",
    "the valence bond requirement is not ideally fulfilled .",
    "unoccupied @xmath20 orbitals at @xmath3 sites form gap states that can not be eliminated by adding further interstitial atoms .",
    "there is no way to fully satisfy the conditions for covalent bonding . despite of being stoichiometric",
    ", b@xmath2 has a macroscopic amount of residual entropy that is as large as that of @xmath1-r boron . because of having such a lowest - energy state , macroscopic residual entropy and no atomic arrangement that can satisfy the conditions for covalent bonding ,",
    "pure @xmath0-t boron is identified as a geometrically frustrated elemental crystal .",
