    "two fundamental restrictions limit the possibility of devising a state reconstruction method . on one hand , the quantum complementarity principle does not allow to recover the quantum state from measurements on a single system , unless we have some prior information on it . on the other hand , the no cloning theorem ensures that it is not possible to make exact copies of a quantum system , without having prior knowledge of its state .",
    "hence , the only possibility for devising a state reconstruction procedure is to provide a measuring strategy that employs numerous identical ( although unknown ) copies of the system , so that different measurements may be performed on each of the copies .    the problem of state estimation resorts essentially to estimating arbitrary operators of a quantum system by using the result of measurements of a set of observables .",
    "if this set of observables is sufficient to give full knowledge of the system state , then we define it a quorum .",
    "notice that , in general , a system may allow various , different quorums .",
    "quantum tomography was born @xcite as a state reconstruction technique in the optical domain , and has recently been extended @xcite to a vast class of systems . by extension , we now denote as `` quantum tomography '' all unbiased quantum state reconstruction procedures , _",
    "i.e. _ those procedures which are affected only by statistical errors that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the number of measurements .",
    "tomography makes use of the results of the quorum measurements in order to reconstruct the expectation value of arbitrary operators ( even not observables ) acting on the system hilbert space .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present in a formally familiar manner ( employing the dirac notation also on operator space ) a constructive method to derive tomographic formulas for quantum systems , at least for finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "this is achieved by giving conditions to build quorums and to check whether a given set of operators is a quorum . in this way",
