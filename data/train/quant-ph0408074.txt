    "an important but unsolved foundational problem concerns the relationship between physics and mathematics . the extensive use of mathematics by theoretical physics shows this close relation , yet there are problems .",
    "if one accepts the standard platonic view that mathematical systems have an objective existence independent and outside of space and time , and physical systems exist inside of and determine the properties of space and time , then it is not clear why mathematics should have anything to do with physics .",
    "this problem has been known for some time .",
    "it was well expressed by wigner @xcite in a paper entitled _ on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences . _",
    "if mathematical systems are different from physical systems , why is mathematics so effective for physics ?    one approach to this problem is to work towards developing a coherent theory of physics and mathematics that treats physical and mathematical systems together in one coherent theory .",
    "some aspects of such a theory , including the connection between theory and experiment , which is an essential part of the validation of any physical theory , have been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "included was the suggestion to tighten the connection between theory and experiment by starting with physical theories based directly on the type of numbers generated by actual experiments and computations .",
    "these numbers are similar to @xmath6 significant figure numbers expressed as finite strings of digits in some basis , the @xmath7 basis .",
    "this paper is limited to a brief description of some aspects of the replacement of @xmath0 based physics by @xmath1 based physics . here",
    "@xmath0 is the usual set of complex numbers and @xmath1 is the set of complex @xmath6 figure numbers as pairs @xmath8 of @xmath6 digit string numbers in some basis that correspond to the real and imaginary parts of @xmath1 .",
    "the paper includes a description of the type of finite string numbers used in @xmath3 and @xmath9 and of @xmath3 based space and time .",
    "additional details are given in @xcite .",
    "the form of the numbers @xmath3 chosen here is based on the string property of all physical representations of numbers , @xcite and properties of outcomes for measurements of continuously varying quantities such as distance , time , momentum , flow , etc . which vary from @xmath10 to very large values .",
    "these are shown on @xmath6 dials or registers with each dial or register assuming any one of the values @xmath11 ( decimal basis ) .",
    "values obtained range from @xmath12}$ ] , ( nondetect ) to @xmath13}1_{n}$ ] ( detect ) to @xmath14}$ ] ( maximum ) .",
    "the underlined numbers with subscripts denote strings of @xmath6 @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath15 followed by a @xmath17 , and @xmath6 @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath15 appearing on either side of nonzero digits are significant .",
    "this type of measurement can be extended to hierarchies of measurements extending arbitrarily in either direction with @xmath6 fixed . in this case",
    "the values of the @xmath19 measurement ranging from @xmath13}1_{n}$ ] ( detect ) to @xmath14}$ ] ( maximum ) are offscale for the @xmath20 measurement and are nondetect for the @xmath21 measurement .",
    "the value @xmath14}+\\underline{0}_{[1,n-1]}1_{n}$ ] , which is just offscale for the @xmath19 , is @xmath13}1_{n}$ ] , or detect , for the @xmath22 here @xmath23 is any integer .    as an example consider the measurement of distance based on a heirarchy of rulers with @xmath24 subdivisons @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath19 one might be a meter stick with cm markings . the @xmath21 would be a @xmath24 meter stick with meter markings and the @xmath20 a cm stick with @xmath26 markings , etc .",
    "this hierarchy represents a scale invariant description of measurements of a quantity .",
    "this representation is used for the numbers in @xmath3 even though one knows that scale invariance of measurements is not exact .",
    "for example , one can not measure distances approaching the planck length or larger than the size of the universe , a range of about @xmath27 orders of decimal magnitude .",
    "support for this representation of numbers comes from the observation that the number @xmath28 of significant figures in measurement outcomes is remarkably insensitive to the magnitude of the quantity measured . for almost all measurements",
    "@xmath29 with @xmath30 for many measurements .",
    "this is the case for quantities such as size or distance ranging from units of fermis to millions of lightyears .",
    "based on the above , the numbers in @xmath3 are taken to be represented in binary by @xmath31}.\\underline{t}_{[1,n]},2n(\\pm\\underline{e})\\}.\\ ] ] where @xmath32}.\\underline{t}_{[1,n]},2n(\\pm\\underline{e } )            = \\pm\\underline{s}_{[1,n]}.\\underline{t}_{[1,n]}\\times            2^{2n(\\pm\\underline{e})}=            ( \\pm\\underline{s^{\\prime}}_{[1,2n]}.,2n(\\pm\\underline{e}-\\frac{1}{2}))\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is a binary string of arbitrary length so that @xmath34 represents all integers .",
    "the dot is the `` binal '' point ( decimal point in binary ) .",

    "also the signs will be assumed to be included in the strings @xmath35}$ ] and @xmath33 unless otherwise indicated .    as the examples show , the set of numbers @xmath3 is discrete and countably infinite .",
    "many orderings are possible .",

    "the inverse operation @xmath51 can be defined from @xmath47 by @xmath52 note that @xmath50 is not in the range of @xmath53 .",
    "the definition of @xmath47 on negative @xmath54 is defined by @xmath55 this says that moving along with the ordering on negative numbers is equivalent to moving opposite to the ordering on the positive numbers and changing the sign .",
    "arithmetic on numbers in @xmath3 and @xmath1 is a combination of the usual modular or computer arithmetic and jump arithmetic .",
    "roundoff is needed for many arithmetic operations .",
    "it is especially important for operations on number strings in different step size regions .",
    "for instance , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath41 .",
    "the subscript @xmath6 on the arithmetic operations and equality denotes their dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath3 space and time is defined by requiring that each space and time dimension is discrete with a one - one order preserving map from the numbers in @xmath3 to the space or time points . in one space dimension",
    "this leads to the representation shown in figure [ 1 ] for @xmath41 .",
    "the points in the figure are shown relative to a locally flat space background and are located so that the relative distance between points corresponds to the difference between the numbers representing the locations .",
    "the choice of @xmath41 in this and in following figures is based on the ease of making figures for @xmath58 this is done in spite of the fact that for this @xmath6 value @xmath3 space has properties that diverge maximally from the usual properties of @xmath59 space .",
    "this is taken care of later on by increasing @xmath6 to values such that @xmath59 space and @xmath3 space are experimentally indistinguishable .",
    "the values @xmath33 and @xmath60 underneath denote the exponents as in eq .",
    "[ numrep ] . each long tick over an exponent and the next two short ticks correspond to the strings , @xmath61 .",
    "exponential jumps occur every @xmath62 steps with the spacing increasing by a factor of @xmath63 or decreasing by a factor of @xmath64 at each jump .",
    "spacing of points between jumps is @xmath65 for each @xmath33 .",
    "the crowding together of the points towards the origin shows that the @xmath3 value of @xmath10 , is an accumulation point .",
    "as such it represents a singularity in @xmath3 based space .",
    "uniqueness follows from the fact that it is the only point with no nearest neighbors .",
    "since the points in @xmath3 space are discrete and linearly ordered , each point other than @xmath10 has two nearest neighbors , one on either side .    the picture is more complex for spaces of more than one dimension in that the coordinate axes and coordinate planes are also singular points of space .",
    "this is shown in figure [ 2 ] for two dimensional space for @xmath41 .",
    "the shading along the axes shows the exponential increasing density of points as one approaches the axes .",
    "figure [ 2 ] also shows that for more than one space dimension the singular points have different properties .",
    "the origin is the only point which is a two dimensional singularity .",
    "the other singular points are one dimensional singularities .",
    "those on the @xmath66 and @xmath67 axes correspond respectively to singularities in the @xmath67 and @xmath66 directions .",
    "three dimensional space is similar in that there is one three dimensional singularity at the origin .",
    "all points on the three coordinate axes are two dimensional singularities and the points on the three coordinate planes are one dimensional .",
    "time is similar to space in that time values are also limited to numbers in @xmath3 .",
    "the value @xmath68 is an accumulation point and is singular just as the point @xmath69 is singular .",
    "this singularity should cause no problems for time translated events such as repeated measurements in quantum mechanics . here the start time for each repetition , is set to some very small value @xmath70 which is too small to affect the physical dynamics of the measurement .",
    "the existence of suitable values of @xmath70 is guaranteed by the exponential crowding of values as one approaches @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath3 space differs from @xmath59 space in that @xmath3 space is scale invariant .",
    "if @xmath33 ranges over all integers , then replacing @xmath33 by @xmath71 with @xmath23 any integer changes nothing as it corresponds to a rescaling of all distances by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "transformations of @xmath3 space based on iteration of @xmath47 , eq .",
    "[ orderadd ] , can be defined by a map @xmath73 on @xmath3 space .",
    "if @xmath74 denotes a point location in @xmath75 space , or the radius of a circle in @xmath76 space or of a sphere in @xmath77 space , then one can define a transformation @xmath73 on @xmath3 space by @xmath78 the action of @xmath73 , acting on each component of each point @xmath74 in @xmath3 space , describes a single step symmetric transformation based on the natural ordering of the numbers in @xmath3 .",
    "the inverse transformation @xmath79 is defined by eq .",

    "[ orderadd ] , consists of a combination of shifts and exponent changes or jumps , the same holds for @xmath73 and @xmath79 . pure jump or scale change transformations correspond to @xmath43 iterations of @xmath73 or @xmath79 in that @xmath80    this shows that @xmath6 is a powerful regulator of the ratio of translation to jump steps in that there are @xmath43 translations for each jump . as @xmath6 increases",
    ", the number of translation steps increases exponentially with @xmath6 as jumps become very rare but very large .",
    "this corresponds to translational , or lattice like , regions of exponentially increasing size for @xmath81 with jumps receding into the distance . in the limit @xmath82 for @xmath83 ,",
    "translation steps remain .    recovery of a space and time that is equivalent to @xmath59 space and time requires that @xmath6 must be large enough so that no possible experiment could distinguish between @xmath3 and @xmath59 based space and time . for values of @xmath84 ( decimal ) , if the planck length corresponds to the spacing of @xmath85 , then the whole universe with size @xmath86 light years , measured in units of the planck length , would fit inside the 3 dimensional translational region for @xmath87 all jumps and space singularities would either be in the region of size @xmath88 or outside the observable universe .",
    "it was seen earlier that transformations of @xmath3 space based on iteration of @xmath73 consist of @xmath43 translation steps separated by exponential jumps .",
    "pure jump or scale change transformations correspond to @xmath43 iterations of @xmath73 or @xmath79 .",
    "it is revealing to illustrate scale change transformations .",
    "these are shown in figure [ 4 ] in one dimension for @xmath58 point locations for two scale transformations , @xmath89 and @xmath90 and the original point locations for @xmath33 are shown .",
    "the two transformations correspond to the action of @xmath91 and @xmath92 scale invariance is shown in that the locations of the points in the three lines are unchanged .",
    "this is relative to the locally flat background on which the figure is drawn .",
    "the figure also shows that the origin acts like a source or sink for space locations under the action of of @xmath91 or @xmath93 .",
    "this is seen by use of numerical labels to distinguish individual points .",
    "the correspondence between the labels ( e.g. @xmath94 replaces @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath94 replaces @xmath97 for @xmath98 ) show that the action of @xmath91 corresponds to an expansion in that it moves points outward from the origin by @xmath99 steps .",
    "the action of @xmath93 , which corresponds to a contraction , moves points inwards toward the origin by @xmath99 steps .",
    "the location of the origin is unchanged .",
    "this feature also applies to single steps .",
    "actions of @xmath73 and @xmath79 also correspond to expansions and contractions in that they move points away from and towards the singularity at the origin . @xmath100 and @xmath99 dimensional spaces are similar in that iterations of @xmath73 and @xmath79 describe expansions and contractions along all radii .",
    "they move points away from and towards the origin , whose location is unchanged . here also the origin acts like a point source or sink .",
    "the main idea presented here is to tighten the theory - experiment connection in physics by replacing the real and complex numbers @xmath101 by sets of finite string numbers given in eq .",
    "[ numrep ] .",
    "this form is based on the properties of output numbers from finite accuracy and finite range measurements of unbounded physical quantities , such as distance and momentum .",
    "@xmath3 based space and time differs from the usual space and time in that it is scale invariant and singularities are present .",
    "the fact that neither exponential jumps nor singularities are observed in space means that the value of @xmath6 at the present time is such that jumps and singularities are limited to regions much smaller than is observable , such as the planck length or larger than is observable , such as the size of the universe .",
    "this can be achieved by @xmath84 ( decimal ) , provided a distance of @xmath85 corresponds to the planck length .",
    "thus the model of space given here is consistent with many other models @xcite in which the structure of space and time breaks down at very small lengths ."
