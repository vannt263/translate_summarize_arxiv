    "there is a lot of effort invested in the development and construction of large interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , virgo , geo , etc .",
    "these observatories are expected to measure the gravitational waves emitted in relativistic astrophysical systems , for example in the coalescence of two compact objects . at the late stages of such systems",
    "one can consider the situation of having two black holes or neutron stars in nearly circular orbits which are shrinking due to the loss , by the emission of gravitational waves , of energy and angular momentum .    in order to estimate",
    "how important is the radiation mechanism of angular momentum in these kind of processes , let us consider briefly the situation of two newtonian point masses , with mass @xmath0 each , in circular motion at a distance @xmath1 .",
    "then one can calculate the ratio between total angular momentum @xmath2 and total mass square @xmath3 , obtaining @xmath4 ; where @xmath5 is the schwarzschild radius of masses @xmath0 , and we are using geometric units for which the speed of light and the gravitational constant have the unit value .",
    "this means that for orbits for which @xmath6 , the angular momentum exceeds the kerr limit to have a final black hole , as opposed to a naked singularity .",
    "in other words , some how , one has to account for the radiation of angular momentum before the final collapse of the system , if one is to expect a black hole at the end of the coalescence .",
    "it is probably interesting to mention that according to newtonian dynamics , the magnitude of the velocity of these particles when they are in the @xmath7 orbit is @xmath8 of the speed of light ; which indicates that a relativistic description of these systems is required .    since the angular momentum loss is crucial for the coalescence mechanism , it is important to have an accurate description of this process .",
    "this leads to the first question which is : what is the definition of angular momentum in a relativistic system ?",
    "there are several difficulties associated to this question .",
    "to begin with , the spacetime appropriate for the description of a relativistic isolated system of compact objects is curved and asymptotically flat .",
    "therefore , since the asymptotic symmetry group is the infinite dimensional bms group@xcite , the notion of angular momentum in general relativity will have to deal with the so called problem of supertranslations .",
    "roughly speaking , among the generators of the bms group , one can distinguish a set of 6 rotations , and an infinite set of supertranslations . a normal 4-dimensional subgroup of the bms group exists which allows for the unambiguous definition of total momentum ; the so called bondi momentum .",
    "to give perspective to this problem , let us recall that in special relativity , the angular momentum @xmath9 , the intrinsic angular momentum @xmath10 and the linear momentum @xmath11 are related by @xmath12 where @xmath13 are numeric spacetime indices and @xmath14 represents the translational freedom .",
    "a rest frame is one in which the momentum @xmath15 has only timelike components .",
    "given a rest reference frame in minkowski spacetime one needs to use the spacelike translation freedom appearing in expression ( [ eq : j ] ) in order to single out the center of mass reference frame . in the center of mass",
    "frame one has @xmath16 ; that is the total momentum coincide with the intrinsic angular momentum .    in general relativity , instead of having just a momentum",
    ", we have an infinite component supermomentum vector ( associated with the infinite generators of supertranslations ) . therefore the analog of equation ( [ eq : j ] ) necessarily will forces us to deal with the notion of supermomentum and its corresponding notion of rest frames@xcite .",
    "we have solved the problem of rest frames in the past with the construction of the so called nice sections@xcite .",
    "given an asymptotically flat spacetime , these sections provide a well defined notion of rest frames at future null infinity .",
    "we have also proved that they have the expected physical properties@xcite(see comments in the next section . ) .    in this article",
    "we use this construction to give a definition of intrinsic angular momentum in general relativity , solving in this way the deficiencies of previous works@xcite .",
    "in order to define rest frames , we need to fix the notion of supermomentum .",
    "we will use the supermomentum ` psi ' that was used in the nice section construction@xcite .    let the section @xmath17 of future null infinity be characterized by the condition @xmath18 , of the bondi coordinate system @xmath19 .",
    "then the supermomentum is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the surface element of the unit sphere on @xmath17 , @xmath22 are the spherical harmonics , the scalar @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where we are using the ghp@xcite notation and where @xmath25 is the leading order asymptotic behavior of the second weyl tensor component , @xmath26 is the leading order of the bondi shear , @xmath27 is the edth operator of the unit sphere , and a dot means partial derivative with respect to the retarded time @xmath28 .",
    "the condition for a section to be of the nice type is that all the spacelike components of the supermomentum vanish .",
    "that is , if @xmath29 is nice then @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "since any section @xmath29 can be obtained from an arbitrary reference section @xmath17 by a supertranslation @xmath32 , it is useful to know what is the equivalent condition on @xmath33 .",
    "we have shown that the condition for the section determined by @xmath33 to be of the nice type is@xcite @xmath34 where the conformal factor @xmath35 can be related to the bondi momentum by @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath11 is evaluated at the section @xmath38 .",
    "also , the rest mass @xmath39 at the same section is given by @xmath40@xcite .",
    "it has been proved that there exists a four parameter family of solutions of equation ( [ nice ] ) with the expected physical properties@xcite .",
    "an important property is that ; if @xmath41 is a nice section and @xmath42 is another nice section which is generated from @xmath41 by a timelike translation , then @xmath42 is to the future of @xmath41 .",
    "this is exactly what happens in minkowski space when @xmath41 is the intersection of the future null cone emanating from an interior point , let us say @xmath43 , with future null infinity ; and if @xmath42 is the intersection of the future null cone corresponding to another point @xmath44 which is in the future of @xmath43 .",
    "there is then an analogy between rest frames at future null infinity centered on a nice section @xmath17 and rest frames of minkowski spacetime centered on a point @xmath45 .",
    "we will define intrinsic angular momentum by using the so called ` charge integrals of the riemann tensor'@xcite .",
    "a charge integral of the riemann tensor is a quantity ascribed to a 2-sphere @xmath17 by the integration of the 2-form @xmath46 , namely : @xmath47 where @xmath46 is expressed in terms of the curvature by @xmath48 and where a right star means right dual of the riemann tensor and the 2-form @xmath49 is defined next . in our case",
    "@xmath17 is assumed to be a nice section@xcite of future null infinity .",
    "how is one supposed to chose the 2-form @xmath50 ?",
    "it was discussed in the literature@xcite that , in terms of the spinor notation , it is convenient to require @xmath51 and @xmath52 where the vector @xmath53 is a generator of asymptotic symmetries(for the details behind this and other matters see the full length paper on this subject@xcite ) .",
    "however on a non - stationary spacetime , these equations have in general no solution at future null infinity . in spite of",
    "that we can require this equations to be satisfied on a nice section .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be the spinor components of the 2-form @xmath50 .",
    "then we require @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a spin weight 0 quantity satisfying @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are spin weight 0 and 1 functions respectively that solve the equations @xmath62 and @xmath63 using the potential @xmath64 of the shear satisfying @xmath65 , the component @xmath66 can be expressed by @xmath67 where the spin weight 0 quantity @xmath68 satisfies @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    having a timelike one - parameter family of nice sections at future null infinity , this procedure provides with a 2-form @xmath50 at future null infinity with the functional dependence @xmath71    then the charge integral becomes @xmath72    in order to pick up the intrinsic angular momentum we need to impose the center of mass condition@xcite @xmath73 this is the analog of the fixing of the translation freedom in the minkowskian case by requiring that three components of the angular momentum tensor vanish , namely @xmath74 . in this way",
    ", there is left a unique one parameter family of nice sections , which determines the center of mass frames .",
    "let us denote these sections with @xmath75 ; then the intrinsic angular momentum @xmath76 is defined by @xmath77 where in order to pick up the intrinsic angular momentum one must take @xmath78 and @xmath79@xcite .",
    "several advantages exist when one uses the charge integral approach for the definition of physical quantities .",
    "for example , although we have defined the tensor @xmath80 at future null infinity , let us consider the possibility to extend its definition to the interior of the spacetime .",
    "assume @xmath81 is a spacelike hypersurface in the interior of the spacetime which extends up to future null infinity , and which has as boundary the section @xmath17 ; as shown in figure [ fig : inte ] .",
    "has as boundary the section _ s _ at future null infinity .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    then , using stokes theorem , one can express the charge integral @xmath82 as an integral on @xmath81 , namely @xmath83 one can prove@xcite that the exterior derivative of @xmath80 can be expressed by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the einstein tensor , @xmath86 is the traceless part of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , its trace ; in other words @xmath89    let us look at equation ( [ eq : dc2 ] ) in the linearized gravity case .",
    "then , it is noted@xcite that if the vector @xmath90 were a killing vector of the flat background metric , and @xmath86 were @xmath91 , then equation ( [ eq : qonsigma ] ) will give the conserved quantities in the context of linearized gravity .",
    "this is telling us that the charge integrals have the appropriate meaning in the weak field limit .",
    "also one can use stokes theorem to calculate the flux of angular momentum .",
    "let @xmath42 be a section to the future of the section @xmath41 of future null infinity , and let now @xmath92 be the region which has as boundaries @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; see figure [ fig : flux ] .",
    "then the flux law for angular momentum is given by @xmath93     at future null infinity has as boundary the sections @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    when the spacetime is stationary , it can be seen@xcite that our definition does give the intrinsic angular momentum of the spacetime ; and also that the center of mass , defined in terms of nice sections , is what one expects to be .",
    "let us consider a radiative spacetime in which one can distinguish three stages ; starting with a stationary regime , passing through a radiating stage and ending in a stationary regime .",
    "one can see that our construction gives the correct intrinsic angular momentum in the first and third stages ; even though the center of mass frames of the first and third stages are related in general by a supertranslation .",
    "it should be stressed that given a point at future null infinity , which it could be considered as the event of the detection of gravitational waves , then the center of mass sections just defined provides with a unique section where all physical quantities should be defined .",
    "a couple of previous works@xcite also provide with a prescription for the selection of unique sections at future null infinity , however they are either non - local@xcite or they do not mention the subject of supermomentum@xcite and therefore can not be considered as either rest frames nor center of mass .",
    "it is probably worth mentioning that several estimates on the gravitational radiation of different astrophysical systems are done with the quadrupole radiation formula .",
    "if one needs these estimates at two different times , such that back reaction has occurred due to the emission of gravitational waves between the first and second time , then the multipoles should be calculated at the corresponding center of mass for each time .",
    "in other words , even in the use of the quadrupole radiation formula one needs to have a well defined notion of center of mass .",
    "our work provides both notions ` center of mass ' and ` intrinsic angular momentum ' in one construction .",
