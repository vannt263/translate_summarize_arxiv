    "the interference of electronic waves leads to negative corrections to the conductivity of electron systems .",
    "this effect is known as weak localization .",
    "it can be observed at very low temperatures , when the inelastic scattering rate is so small that the phase coherence is kept over many acts of elastic scattering .",
    "although these quantum corrections are usually small , they can be distinguished due to their specific dependence on temperature , magnetic field , and frequency of the applied electric field .",
    "the fundamentals of the theory of weak localization have been developed in refs . 1 - 4 and a review is given in ref .",
    "recently considerable attention@xmath9 has been drawn to weak - localization phenomena in layered systems where characteristic features are caused by a dimensionality crossover .",
    "these studies have been applied mostly to multilayer systems ( superlattices ) although the cases of barrier - separated thin metallic films@xmath10 and single - barrier structures@xmath11 have also been investigated . in this paper",
    "we calculate the weak - localization corrections to the in - plane conductivity of two tunnel - coupled two - dimensional ( 2d ) layers , the system which is typically formed in double quantum well structures@xmath12 . such double - layer electron systems represent an intermediate case between a single 2d layer and a three - dimensional superlattice and their various interesting properties are caused mainly by this fact . as concerns the weak localization problem , the tunnel coupling introduces an additional cutoff parameter in the diffusion pole , which implies that the weak - localization contribution to the conductivity depends on the strength of this coupling .",
    "this happens when the probability of tunneling is not small in comparison to that of inelastic scattering .",
    "another important consequence of the tunnel coupling is that a weak magnetic field @xmath1 applied _ parallel _ to the layers leads to a delocalization as does a field @xmath1 applied _ perpendicular _ to the layers@xmath13 .",
    "the physical origin of the effect of parallel field is explained in a similar way : this field introduces an additional phase for the electron which moves in one layer , then tunnels into another layer , moves there , and finally tunnels back and returns to the initial point .",
    "the described phenomena are the subject of the present study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
