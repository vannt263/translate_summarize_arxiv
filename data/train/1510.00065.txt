    "for the solution of a bulk single donor in silicon , a box size of 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm @xmath12 30 nm was used such that the donor wavefunctions are not affected by the interfaces of the box @xcite .",

    "an exact solution of the three - particle system involves diagonalizing eq . 1 in the basis of many slater determinants comprising of the single particle electron and hole states until convergence is achieved with the so called configuration interaction ( ci ) approach .",
    "however , such an approach is computationally intractable for a hamiltonian of over one million atoms , as coulomb and exchange integrals between the three particles need to be computed with a very large number wave functions to represent the spatial spread and symmetries of the electrons and holes .",
    "hence , we employ a mean - field method based on the self - consistency between the effective single particle hamiltonian of each particle and the poisson equation . in this approach ,",

    "<S> a detailed understanding of the range of excitation frequencies possible in nanoscale devices and the environmental conditions needed for a stable d@xmath0x helps to extend the optical addressing methods from bulk ensembles to single donor qubits , and may also enable hybrid opto - electric addressing of nuclear spins in silicon with improved fidelity and possible higher temperature operation .    </S>",
