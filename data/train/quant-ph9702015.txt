    "the preceding paper @xcite discusses the maximum information which an eavesdropper , eve , can obtain for a given error rate between alice , who sends signals , and bob , their legitimate recipient , in the context of the bb84 cryptographic scheme @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that eve s optimum strategy , discussed in sec .",
    "iii of the preceding paper , can be embodied in a simple quantum circuit , of the type proposed for quantum computation  @xcite , together with appropriate initial states of the two qubits which constitute eve s probe , and suitable final measurements .",
    "the quantum circuit is extremely simple : it involves only two gates , of the controlled - not variety , although adding a third gate could be advantageous under some circumstances ( discussed towards the end of sec .",
    "[ s3 ] ) . when it is analyzed using the same consistent history methods we used earlier @xcite to simplify the final fourier",
    "transform in shor s factorization algorithm @xcite , it is immediately obvious how the parameters in eve s initial state are related to the error rates , both errors in the transmission from alice to bob , and the errors which determine the mutual information between alice and eve .    the results of the preceding paper which are essential for understanding the present one are summarized in sec .  [",
    "s2 ] below .",
    "the quantum circuit is described in analyzed in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , and a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "in the bb84 scheme , alice transmits a signal using a qubit described by a two - dimensional hilbert space ; for example , the polarization of a photon , or the spin of a spin half particle . the kets @xmath0 and @xmath1 form an orthonormal basis of this space , and @xmath2 form an alternative ( conjugate ) basis .",
    "alice chooses one of these bases at random , and then transmits one of the basis vectors , also chosen at random .",
    "her qubit , hereafter denoted by @xmath3 , is intercepted by eve and made to interact with a probe consisting of two qubits , which we shall call @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "after this , eve sends @xmath3 on to bob , who measures it in one of the two bases , again chosen at random .",
    "eventually alice announces publicly the basis she used for transmission of the signal , and in those cases in which bob measured in the same basis ( the other cases are of no interest , for alice and bob discard the results ) , eve , who now knows the basis alice employed , measures the qubits in her probe in order to estimate which signal alice sent .    in sec .",
    "ii of the preceding paper it was shown that the average information ( in the shannon sense ) @xmath6 which eve obtains about alice s signal when the latter uses the @xmath7 basis is bounded by @xmath8 , \\label{ixy}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the error rate produced by the interaction with eve s probe when alice transmits and bob measures in the @xmath11 basis .",
    "similarly , when alice sends a signal in the @xmath11 basis , the average information @xmath12 which eve can gain is bounded by a similar inequality @xmath13 , \\label{iuv}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 the error rate from alice to bob when they employ the @xmath7 basis .",
    "the quantum circuit used in eve s optimum strategy is shown in fig .",
    "the three horizontal lines represent three qubits thought of as moving from left to right as time increases .",
    "the top line is alice s qubit @xmath3 on its way to bob , while the two lower lines show qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 representing eve s probe .",
    "these interact with alice s qubit through two controlled - not gates , labeled 1 and 2 and indicated by solid vertical lines .",
    "the dashed vertical lines indicate where the qubits are at two specific times which we will want to refer to later .",
    "the two diagrams in fig .  [ fgx ] represent the same quantum circuit , but show its action in two different bases : the @xmath7 basis in ( a ) and the @xmath11 basis in ( b ) .",
    "by @xmath7 basis we now mean the basis of the full eight - dimensional hilbert space corresponding to qubits @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , with each qubit in either an @xmath0 or a @xmath1 state .",
    "thus the basis vectors are of the form @xmath15 and so forth .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11 basis is constituted by vectors of the form @xmath16 , and so forth ; each of the qubits is in either the state @xmath17 or the state @xmath18 , where these are related to @xmath0 and @xmath1 through ( [ euv ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fgx](a ) , the @xmath7 basis , gate 1 is a unitary transformation which when applied to qubits @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with the left letter in each ket referring to @xmath3 and the right to @xmath4 , yields @xmath19 that is , if @xmath3 is in state @xmath1 , @xmath4 is flipped from @xmath0 to @xmath1 or vice versa , whereas if @xmath3 is in state @xmath0 , @xmath4 remains unchanged ; in either case , @xmath3 retains its original value .",
    "such a gate is called `` controlled - not '' , because flipping a bit corresponds to logical negation , and whether or not the _ target _ qubit @xmath4 is flipped depends on the state of the _ control _ qubit @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath5 is not involved in gate 1 , so ( [ gate1a ] ) can be extended to the eight basis vectors of the full hilbert space by inserting a third letter in each of the kets to represent the state of @xmath5 , the same letter on each side of the arrow : @xmath20(a ) is another controlled - not operation , but now @xmath5 is the control qubit and @xmath3 the target qubit , whereas @xmath4 is not involved ( as indicated by the absence of any symbol at the intersection of its line with the vertical line representing the gate ) .",
    "the action of gate 1 followed by gate 2 results in the following unitary transformation on the @xmath7 basis vectors : @xmath21    if instead of the @xmath7 basis , the @xmath11 basis , see ( [ euv ] ) , is employed for all three qubits , the same circuit , corresponding to the same unitary transformation ( [ gates ] ) , takes the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fgx](b ) .",
    "the reason is that if _ both _ qubits involved in a controlled - not gate are changed from the @xmath7 to the @xmath11 basis , the action of the gate can again be represented as a controlled - not , but with the _ control and target qubits interchanged _ , as the reader can easily verify using ( [ euv ] ) .",
    "thus ( [ gate1a ] ) is equivalent , again with qubit @xmath3 on the left and @xmath4 on the right , to @xmath22 as can be checked by employing ( [ euv ] ) with ( [ gate1a ] ) .",
    "the result in the @xmath11 basis of the two gates acting in succession can be worked out either by combining ( [ euv ] ) with ( [ gates ] ) or , more simply , by employing ( [ gate1b ] ) followed by the corresponding transformation for gate 2 in fig .",
    "[ fgx](b ) .",
    "the following is then an optimum strategy for eve .",
    "she prepares qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 in initial states @xmath23 where , with @xmath24 or @xmath7 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related through the formulas : @xmath27 we assume , for convenience , that both quantities are between 0 and 1/2 , so that ( [ ddelta ] ) defines one quadrant of a circle of radius 1/2 centered at @xmath28 in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "it is easy to check that the second equality in each line in ( [ ef0 ] ) is consistent with ( [ euv ] ) and ( [ ddelta ] ) .",
    "after the initial preparation , qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 interact with alice s qubit @xmath3 in the quantum circuit of fig .",
    "[ fgx ] , and eve allows @xmath3 to go on to bob while storing @xmath4 and @xmath5 until alice announces the basis in which the signal was transmitted . then eve measures both qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the basis ( @xmath7 or @xmath11 ) announced by alice .    one can check that this is an optimum strategy by applying the unitary transformation ( [ gates ] ) to the initial state @xmath30 expressed as a linear combination of the @xmath7 basis states , to obtain @xmath31 if @xmath32 and @xmath33 if @xmath34 , in the notation of the preceding paper , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 by means of : @xmath37 then using the projectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 defined in sec .",
    "iii of the preceding paper , one can verify that the conditions given there ( in sec .",
    "ii ) for saturating the bounds ( [ ixy ] ) and ( [ iuv ] ) are satisfied .    however , we shall use an alternative approach , which yields more insight into the choice of coefficients in ( [ ef0 ] ) : we shall calculate the error rates and mutual information directly from the quantum circuit in fig .",
    "[ fgx ] , and verify that ( [ ixy ] ) and ( [ iuv ] ) are satisfied as equalities .",
    "let us begin with the situation in which alice announces , and eve measures in , the @xmath7 basis , which can best be understood using fig .",
    "[ fgx](a ) .",
    "first consider the case in which @xmath14 and @xmath40note that eve can choose them independently  are both equal to zero , so that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are initially in the state @xmath0 , ( [ ef0 ] ) .",
    "then gate 1 simply copies qubit @xmath3 , @xmath0 or @xmath41 , to qubit @xmath4 , so that by measuring @xmath4 in the @xmath7 basis , eve knows precisely which signal alice sent .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath5 is in the state @xmath0 , qubit @xmath3 remains unchanged on its way from alice to bob , so eve s intervention causes no error",
    ".    if @xmath42 but @xmath14 is positive , eve will again be able to determine which signal alice sent by measuring @xmath4 .",
    "however , measuring @xmath5 will yield @xmath1 with probability @xmath14 and @xmath0 with probability @xmath43 . since @xmath5 is the control qubit for gate 2 ,",
    "if it is in state @xmath1 , an error will be produced in the transmission from alice to bob , while if it is in state @xmath0 , there will be no error .",
    "hence eve s measurement of @xmath5 , while it tells her nothing about which signal alice sent , shows her whether or not , in this particular case , bob s measurement yielded the same or the opposite result from what alice transmitted .    in the preceding paragraph we used a process of _ retrodiction",
    "_ , in which we inferred the prior state of qubit @xmath5 from eve s measurement .",
    "this can lead to quantum paradoxes when it is not used in the proper way , but in the present context it can be justified , just as in @xcite , by using an appropriate framework or family of consistent histories @xcite .",
    "however , rather than employing retrodiction for qubit @xmath4 as well , it is more straightforward to adopt at the outset an appropriate consistent family , which we shall call the @xmath7 framework , based upon all three qubits being in either an @xmath0 or a @xmath1 state at a time @xmath44 shortly after @xmath45 , when ( [ ef0 ] ) applies , but before qubits @xmath3 and @xmath4 reach the first gate , see fig .",
    "[ fgx ] , and at all later times as well  @xcite . in this framework , @xmath4 at time @xmath44 is in the state @xmath1 with probability @xmath40 , and in @xmath0 with probability @xmath46 , the absolute squares of the corresponding coefficients in ( [ ef0 ] ) , while for @xmath5 these probabilities are @xmath14 and @xmath43 . as long as we are using the @xmath7 framework ,",
    "these probabilities can be thought of in the same way as in a classical stochastic theory @xcite .",
    "because qubit @xmath5 at @xmath44 , and thus at all later times until it is measured , is in state @xmath1 with probability @xmath14 , this is also the probability of an error if alice is transmitting to bob in the @xmath7 mode , as noted earlier .",
    "next let us consider qubit @xmath4 .",
    "the results of eve s measurement , which is the value @xmath4 has when it leaves gate 1 , will coincide with the initial value of @xmath3 only if at @xmath44 @xmath4 is in the state @xmath47 .",
    "otherwise the measured value will be the reverse of what alice transmits . thus if one thinks of gate 1 as part of a communication channel from alice ( qubit @xmath3 ) to eve ( qubit @xmath4 ) , it is a noisy channel with a probability @xmath40 that a bit will be flipped .",
    "the mutual information @xmath6 associated with such a channel is easily computed , assuming that alice transmits @xmath0 or @xmath1 with equal probability , and is given by the right side of ( [ ixy ] ) .    to understand what happens",
    "when alice sends a signal , and eve makes her measurements , in the @xmath11 basis , we use fig .",
    "[ fgx](b ) and an alternative consistent family , which we call the @xmath11 framework , in which all three qubits are in state @xmath17 or @xmath18 at @xmath44 and all later times @xcite . then in this framework",
    ", @xmath4 is in state @xmath18 with probability @xmath10 , and @xmath17 with probability @xmath48 , at @xmath44 ; see ( [ ef0 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath5 the corresponding probabilities are @xmath49 and @xmath50 . as @xmath4 is now the control qubit for gate 1 , fig .",
    "[ fgx](b ) , it is at once obvious that when @xmath4 is in state @xmath51 , there will be an error in the transmission from alice to bob when they use the @xmath11 basis .",
    "thus the error rate in this basis is @xmath10 , the probability that @xmath4 is in state @xmath18 at @xmath44 , and hence at later times as well . also by measuring @xmath4 ( in the @xmath11 basis )",
    "alice can determine whether or not such an error has occurred .",
    "however , measuring @xmath4 tells her nothing about whether alice sent a @xmath17 or a @xmath18 . to obtain this information",
    ", she must measure qubit @xmath5 .",
    "the task is a bit more complicated than in the case of the @xmath7 basis considered earlier , because qubit @xmath3 may have been flipped through its interaction with @xmath4 before it is copied to @xmath5 .",
    "however , since she also measures @xmath4 , eve can easily correct for this effect .",
    "consequently , the noise in the channel between alice ( qubit @xmath3 ) and eve ( qubit @xmath5 corrected by @xmath4 ) is determined by the uncertainty in the value of @xmath5 at @xmath44 ; a bit passing from alice to eve through this channel will be flipped with probability @xmath49 , the probability that @xmath5 is in state @xmath51 at @xmath44 . again",
    ", the mutual information @xmath12 for such a channel is easily computed , and is given by the right side of ( [ iuv ] ) .",
    "consequently , one sees that the error rates produced by eve s employing the initial states in ( [ ef0 ] ) are , indeed , @xmath14 and @xmath10 in the @xmath7 and @xmath11 bases , respectively , whereas the appropriate mutual information in each case saturates the corresponding bound , ( [ ixy ] ) or ( [ iuv ] ) .",
    "this shows that eve s strategy employing the gates in fig .",
    "[ fgx ] is , indeed , optimal .",
    "furthermore , one can understand how eve faces a trade - off between gaining information when alice sends in one mode , and creating errors when alice uses the other mode .",
    "if alice only employed the @xmath7 mode , eve would , of course , set both @xmath14 and @xmath40 equal to zero , as this would cause no errors in the transmission from alice to bob , and produce a perfect copy of alice s signal in qubit @xmath4 .",
    "however , @xmath42 is equivalent , ( [ ddelta ] ) , to @xmath52 , so that obtaining the maximum possible information about the @xmath7 transmission produces a large number of errors in the @xmath11 mode .",
    "similarly , setting @xmath53 , while it produces no errors when alice transmits in the @xmath7 mode , has the consequence the @xmath54 , which means that eve can extract no information whatever when alice transmits in the @xmath11 mode .",
    "eve s strategy as described above requires that she store _ both _ qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 while waiting for alice to announce the basis used in sending the signal . since the `` storage costs '' of preserving the qubits against decoherence ,",
    "should there be a long delay , could be high , it is worth noting , as was pointed out in the preceding paper , that only one qubit needs to be preserved if eve just wants to estimate which signal alice sent , and is not interested in keeping track of whether an error occurred in the transmission from alice to bob . from fig .",
    "[ fgx](a ) it is evident that in the @xmath7 case , qubit @xmath5 could be discarded after it emerges from gate 2 , since eve only uses @xmath4 to gain information about alice s signal . however , this would not work for the @xmath11 basis , where the information of interest is contained in the correlation between the two qubits .",
    "there are , nonetheless , two obvious strategies available to eve .",
    "she can measure qubit @xmath5 in the @xmath11 basis immediately after it emerges from gate 2 , and record the value in her notebook , while preserving qubit @xmath4 for later analysis .",
    "if alice later announces that she used the @xmath7 basis , eve ignores the record in her notebook , and measures @xmath4 in the @xmath7 basis . if , on the other hand , the basis turns out to be @xmath11 , eve measures @xmath4 in that basis and uses it to correct the @xmath5 value she measured earlier .",
    "an alterative approach is to add a third gate to the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fgx ] , a controlled - not in which @xmath4 is the control and @xmath5 the target in the @xmath7 basis ( and , of course , the reverse in the @xmath11 basis ) . after it passes through this third gate , eve discards qubit @xmath5 and retains qubit @xmath4 for later measurement in whichever basis is appropriate ; this is equivalent to the approach employed in the preceding paper .",
    "the use of the quantum circuit does not solve the problem of whether eve s optimum strategy is essentially unique .",
    "one can show that interchanging ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fgx ] , that is , employing the circuit in ( a ) for the @xmath11 basis and that in ( b ) for the @xmath7 basis , is equivalent to the original scheme preceded and followed by unitary transformations on the qubits of eve s probe , so that it is not different in any essential way .",
    "however , this obviously does not settle the question of uniqueness .",
    "we have shown that eve s optimum strategy can be represented by a simple quantum circuit involving two controlled - not gates , along with the preparation of the two qubits of her probe in suitable initial states , and their later measurement in the same basis announced by alice . in this circuit , the function of each qubit of the probe is clearly distinguished .",
    "for example , in the @xmath7 basis , qubit @xmath4 is employed for extracting information about the signal alice sends , while @xmath5 creates errors in the transmission from alice to bob . while these errors can be reduced to zero by eve s choice of a suitable initial state for @xmath5",
    ", this choice makes it impossible for her to obtain any information when alice transmits in the @xmath11 basis , for which eve must extract the information using @xmath5 .",
    "while the use of the quantum circuit provides one with a certain amount of insight into eavesdropping strategies , it does not by itself provide a proof that the strategy is optimal , for which one needs the bounds derived in the preceding paper , nor does it show that there is a unique optimal strategy .",
