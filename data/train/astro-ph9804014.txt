    "at a distance of just 725 kpc , m32 is the nearest `` true elliptical '' ( as contrasted to a dwarf elliptical ) galaxy to the milky way .",
    "s relative proximity allowed its outer regions to be resolved into stars by the first generation of large optical telescopes ( @xcite ) , while its crowded inner regions remained unresolved until the advent of the hubble space telescope ( see @xcite ) . the ability to study both",
    "the integrated light of m32 and the individual stars contributing to that light has made this galaxy a keystone of efforts to understand the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "one of the outstanding puzzles in the study of elliptical galaxies has been that of the ultraviolet excess ( uvx ) ; this term refers to the increase in flux shortward of 2000 @xmath0 seen in integrated spectra of elliptical galaxies , relative to the amount predicted by the simplest model fits to their optical spectra ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an important step in identifying the stellar population responsible for the uvx was made by @xcite , who identified a strong correlation between the strength of the uvx and the mean metallicity of the galaxy in a sample of 24 quiescent systems .",
    "m32 defined the uv - faint , low - metallicity end of the @xcite sample , with an m@xmath4 @xmath1 v - band color of 4.5 @xmath20.2 and a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath6 ( c.f .",
    "the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite attributed the ( 1550@xmath1v ) color of m32 to the presence of `` classical '' post - asymptotic giant branch ( p - agb ) stars in the galaxy .    the ability of p - agb stars to produce the ( fuv@xmath1v ) color of m32 depends strongly on the age and metallicity distributions of m32 s stellar population .",
    "however , the very strong degree of central concentration which makes m32 an attractive target for studies of integrated light has hindered progress in the characterization of its stellar populations .",
    "@xcite provides an overview of the various strands of evidence for and against the presence of an intermediate - age ( few gyr ) population in m32 .",
    "spectral syntheses performed by @xcite indicated that the dominant contributors to the present - day optical luminosity of m32 are aged @xmath55 gyr with solar metallicity , but noted that the peak star formation rate might have occurred as long ago as 15 gyr if the metallicity ranged as low as one - tenth solar .",
    "the existence of a major intermediate - age population in m32 has yet to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt despite the significant body of work dealing with this problem over the past two decades .",
    "ground - based ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and hst ( @xcite ) photometry have both been interpreted to indicate the presence of a significant metallicity spread in m32 , in good agreement with recent long - slit spectra ( @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "most investigators seem to agree that significant numbers of stars with metallicities between @xmath7 [ fe / h ] @xmath8 are present in m32 s stellar mix ; of course , the relative numbers of metal - rich and metal - poor stars are poorly constrained due to the usual age - metallicity tradeoff .",
    "@xcite ( 1994 ) discovered the presence of a radial metallicity gradient : between 15@xmath0 and 1@xmath0 from the galaxy s center , the metallicity decreases at the rate @xmath9[fe / h]/@xmath9log(r ) @xmath10 .",
    "an age gradient has also been reported for m32 , as @xcite infer from the integrated line indices obtained by @xcite that the nucleus of m32 is both several gigayears younger and somewhat more metal - rich than its outer regions .",
    "the deepest optical photometry of resolved stars ( @xcite ) suggests a median age of 8 gyr for m32 with an average metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath11 for a region 1@xmath02@xmath0 from the nucleus .",
    "m32 was observed by @xcite in the far - ultraviolet using hst s faint object camera ( foc ) , but there was difficulty in calibrating the absolute throughput of their filter set ; m32 s fuv color was interpreted as an indication of a stellar population as young as 3 gyr with slightly sub - solar metallicity .",
    "@xcite also imaged m32 s central region with foc , using the f175w and f275w filters ; their results seemed to indicate a conflict with stellar evolutionary theory , but the interpretation of the data was complicated by the redleak of the foc ultraviolet filters ( see , e.g. , the discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "m32 was also observed by the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( @xcite ) ; a strong fuv@xmath1b color gradient was found , demonstrating that the the galaxy s uvx is _ weakest _ in the center and increases with radius .",
    "we observed m32 as part of a wfpc2 gto program to study the hot , luminous post - agb populations and the uv upturn phenomenon in nearby early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the use of the f160bw filter with wfpc2 provides a unique constraint on the fuv properties of m32 , coupling hst s high resolution ( angular scales @xmath5 01 pix@xmath12 ) with a zero - redleak ( optical transmission @xmath13 1% t@xmath14 ) wide - band filter that permits an accurate determination of the ( fuv@xmath1v ) color ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "images of m32 were taken on 1994 october 1920 , with the nucleus imaged onto the wf3 chip of wfpc2 .",
    "the data comprised 2 @xmath15 2000 sec exposures in f160bw ( each exposure was split into two parts to facilitate cosmic ray rejection ) , together with a 10 sec and a 100 sec exposure in f555w .",
    "f160bw has a response from roughly 12002100 @xmath0 and is characterized by an extremely low throughput , while f555w is the wfpc2 analog to johnson v. wfpc2 and its filter set are described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the images were reduced in the standard way according to the procedures of @xcite ; cosmic ray rejection and image manipulations were performed within iraf .",
    "we identified bright stars in the outer regions of the nearby spiral m31 in the v and fuv frames and used their relative offsets to check the alignment of our wfpc2 images , which proved to be aligned at the sub - pixel level .",
    "the central 15@xmath0 @xmath15 15@xmath0 of m32 , as seen at 1600  , are shown in fig .",
    "1 ; the galaxy is lurking in the shadows of detectability .",
    "a radial ultraviolet light profile , derived with the iraf task imexam , is shown in the upper left .",
    "the broad , shallow profile differs strongly from the high - amplitude peaks produced by the unremovable residue of large cosmic ray events such as the one several arcseconds east of the galactic nucleus .",
    "in contrast , application of imexam to random locations in the field typically produced constant value or linear fits with no central peak .",
    "photometry was performed according to the procedure laid out in @xcite , using an 05 aperture and their tabulated zeropoints for the stmag system .",
    "zeropoint corrections were made to account for the deposition of solid contaminants on the cold window of the ccd and for chip - to - chip variations in sensitivity , following @xcite .",
    "@xcite report an interstellar reddening of a@xmath16 = 0.31 mag towards m32 ; to correct for this , we assumed a standard galactic extinction law with r@xmath17 = 3.1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a@xmath18 was then taken from @xcite to be 0.25 mag ( assuming a k5 stellar spectrum ) .",
    "the selective extinction in f160bw was calculated using the method of @xcite to be a@xmath19 = 0.70 mag for m32 .",
    "an automated search for point sources near the nucleus of m32 proved negative ; visual inspection of the nuclear region suggested the presence of a faint , diffuse contribution to the fuv light .",
    "this impression was strengthened when we found that the best gaussian fit to the diffuse light peaked at the position of the optical center of the galaxy , with a fwhm = 4.6 pix ( compare to the f160bw point - spread function with fwhm @xmath5 2.1 pix ) . for display purposes , we convolved the f160bw image with a 5@xmath155 median filter in order to sharpen the contrast between diffuse features and the background .",
    "the filtered image is shown in fig .",
    "2 ; we have plotted isophotes of the f555w image on top of the f160bw image in order to demonstrate that the emission we have identified with the nucleus is indeed coincident with the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "aperture photometry of the nucleus yielded @xmath20 = 18.39 @xmath20.26 mag ( 1@xmath21 random photometric error ; systematic effects are expected to create an additional @xmath510% uncertainty ) . to quantify the significance of this measurement",
    ", we placed 120 identical 05 apertures at random across the combined wf3 frame and examined the results .",
    "sky values were determined locally in all cases , and the mean value was not found to vary appreciably across the field .",
    "the resulting photometry showed that m32 s nucleus is the brightest region of the wf3 frame .",
    "a comparison to the distribution of test aperture magnitudes showed that the nucleus sits 3.9@xmath21 above the background , defined by the mean number of counts in the test apertures and the scatter around that mean .",
    "this number is likely an _ underestimate _ of the significance of the detection , because the mean of the test aperture counts was not corrected for contamination by unremoved cosmic ray events .",
    "we determine from the test aperture count distribution that our minimum 3@xmath21 detection level occurs at @xmath20 = 18.7 .",
    "in contrast , the nucleus is extremely obvious in the v - band ; the diffuse optical light has an azimuthally averaged fwhm of 4.2 pix , and a total magnitude @xmath22 = 12.99 @xmath2 0.01 .",
    "thus we find a dereddeded ( 160@xmath1555 ) color of 4.9 @xmath2 0.3 for the nucleus of m32 .",
    "this is consistent with the preliminary analysis of the same dataset by @xcite which yielded ( 160@xmath1555 ) = 4.7 @xmath2 0.2 , and in satisfactory agreement with the iue ( 1550@xmath1v ) color of 4.50 reported by @xcite .",
    "varying the aperture radius between 01 and 08 uncovered no variation in ( 160@xmath1555 ) , although the errors are large enough to hide a mild gradient if it exists .",
    "beyond 08 , the fuv surface brightness drops below our detection threshhold .",
    "we performed surface photometry within 5@xmath0 of the nucleus in the f555w frames .",
    "our results agree with the wfpc1 results of @xcite .",
    "we find a surface brightness at 03 of @xmath23 = 12.5 mag arcsec@xmath24 , rising to 11.9 mag arcsec@xmath24 at 01 , in excellent agreement with both @xcite and the model mass distribution derived by @xcite .",
    "the f555w major axis radial profile of the central 5@xmath0 of m32 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "m32 shows a pronounced nuclear cusp in its light profile .",
    "we did not obtain sufficient signal - to - noise in f160bw to perform accurate surface photometry , but the fuv light of m32 s nucleus is clearly more broadly distributed than a point source .",
    "we infer from our agreement with the iue ( 1550@xmath1v ) color the the fuv light is distributed similarly to the optical light .",
    "the smoothly distributed light indicates that it is likely due to the presence of a relatively large number of faint objects .",
    "it seems impossible to reproduce the integrated spectrum of m32 with a single - age , single - metallicity `` simple stellar population '' ( ssp ) ( @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "however , ssps remain a useful tool for interpreting the ( 160@xmath1555 ) color , because they provide the tools with which to construct more realistic models . for ssps , the ( fuv@xmath1v ) color",
    "is predicted to be a sensitive function of both age and metallicity , and hence a valuable observation for the derivation of star formation histories ( @xcite ) .",
    "the exact dependencies of ( fuv@xmath1v ) on stellar age and metallicity are highly uncertain , and this limits its predictive power . as discussed in detail by @xcite ,",
    "the age predictions depend critically on poorly modeled processes such as stellar mass - loss .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties in our interpretation are dominated by systematic model effects rather than observational errors .    in order to provide an interpretational starting point , we compared the observed ( 160@xmath1555 ) color of the nucleus of m32 to the ssp predictions of @xcite .",
    "table 1 gives the ages of ssps which are predicted to exhibit ( 160@xmath1555 ) = 4.9 @xmath20.3 , for a range of metallicities . in table 1",
    ", @xmath25 indicates the acceptable age range for models in which the fuv light derives from main - sequence stars , while @xmath26 gives the ages for which evolved stars provide the fuv light .",
    "the errorbars in table 1 are _ internal , random , observational _ errors only , and merely reflect the propagation of photometric error into the model predictions .",
    "a thorough discussion of the systematic errors in these models is beyond the scope of this paper ( c.f . , @xcite ) , but uncertainties in the physics of stellar - mass loss and helium - enrichment limit the absolute precision of such models to several billion years ( particularly the older models , which most concern us here ) .",
    "the ages in table 1 are therefore most useful as relative measures , so that m32 s stellar populations may be compared with those of other galaxies using a consistent set of models . as absolute measures , they are subject to extreme uncertainty .    in these models ,",
    "the ratio of fuv to optical light is not a monotonically decreasing function of age : early in a galaxy s lifetime , ( fuv@xmath1v ) increases ( gets redder ) as the hot upper main - sequence stars die off .",
    "eventually , as the total luminosity of the ssp continues to fade with age , the fuv contribution of the short - lived p - agb stars begins to become important , and ( fuv@xmath1v ) becomes bluer again . at sufficiently high metallicities ( z @xmath27 2z@xmath28 ) , these models predict a point at which low - mass helium - burning stars avoid the agb in favor of long - lived uv - bright phases , causing a sharp increase in the fuv flux as this behavior sets in at ages @xmath5510 gyr .",
    "the ( 160@xmath1555 ) color of m32 can be matched by either young or old ssps .",
    "we rule out the young ( 0.52 gyr ) class of models for two reasons : first , these ages are much younger than even the youngest intermediate - age populations inferred from optical spectroscopy and photometry of m32 ; and second , models of p - agb stars ( @xcite ) for such young ages are predicted to have @xmath20 @xmath5 18.5 at the distance of m32 ; only one such p - agb star would be required to account for the fuv light of m32 s nucleus , and would be seen as a point source in our images .",
    "the remaining models indicate an ssp age of 1213 gyr for m32 s nucleus for metallicities less than about 5 times solar . in this type of ssp ,",
    "the fuv light is produced by classical p - agb stars . in the super metal - rich case the age of the ssp drops to @xmath56 gyr due to the production of hot agb - manqu stars via metal - enhanced mass loss on the rgb ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to remember that these age values are subject to large , model - driven systematic errors and should not be considered as definitive determinations .",
    "m32 is not a likely candidate to harbor agb - manqu stars , as the required metallicity is too high by a factor of two or more .",
    "the best matching ssps of reasonable metallicities are then 1213 gyr old ; this is consistent with the results of @xcite indicating that half the optical light of m32 comes from stars older than @xmath58 gyr .",
    "note that m32 is _ not _ an ssp ; any intermediate - age population that contribues to the optical light is predicted to be fuv - faint and thus pushes the required age of the fuv - bright population to even older ages in order to reproduce the integrated ( 160@xmath1555 ) color .",
    "we do not have enough radial coverage in f160bw to permit comparison with the uit result that m32 s fuv light falls off more slowly with radius than its optical light ( @xcite ) .",
    "no gradient in ( 160@xmath1555 ) is seen with the central 08 of m32 s nucleus .",
    "if the uit result is interpreted in the context of ssps , it would suggest that either m32 s metallicity is increasing with radius ( contrary to previous results of @xcite 1994 ) , or that the galaxy s mean age is increasing with radius .",
    "this type of radial age gradient has also been suggested to exist in the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc 147 ( @xcite ) and in the andromeda i dwarf spheroidal ( @xcite ) ; it may turn out to be a general feature of small , spheroidal galaxies .",
    "@xmath29 we have imaged the nucleus of m32 , an elliptical galaxy with a weak ultraviolet upturn , in the visible and far - ultraviolet with wfpc2 aboard the _ hubble space telescope_. these data extend fuv observations of m32 s nucleus to smaller radii than have heretofore been possible .",
    "we found the nucleus to have a color ( 160@xmath1555 ) = 4.9 @xmath2 0.3 , in agreement with the results from iue .",
    "@xmath29 like @xcite , we were unable to resolve the fuv light of m32 into individual stars .",
    "unlike @xcite and @xcite , we do not require the presence of a 35 gyr population or agb - manqu stars to explain the ( fuv@xmath1v ) color of m32 .",
    "using the simple stellar population models of @xcite , we find that the ( 160@xmath1555 ) color of m32 is most easily explained by the presence of a moderately metal - poor stellar population aged @xmath3012 gyr .",
    "given the large uncertainties in the processes which can induce old , low - mass stars to high - temperatures , this age should be considered uncertain to within @xmath2 @xmath315 gyr ( yi _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , 1998 ) ; thus an intermediate - age population can not be ruled out .",
    "@xmath29 surface photometry in the visible is in excellent agreement with deconvolved wfpc1 and ground - based data ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because of the poor signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", there is no evidence in our data that the fuv light is distributed differently than the optical light .",
