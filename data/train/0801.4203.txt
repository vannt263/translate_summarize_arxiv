    "quark confinement is a fundamental problem to be solved in theoretical physics .",
    "however , we have not yet obtained a satisfactory derivation of quark confinement .",
    "even if a mathematical proof of quark confinement was given , we wish to know the fundamental mechanism behind the phenomenon of quark confinement from the physical point of view . in this paper",
    "we consider quark confinement based on the wilson criterion @xcite in yang - mills theory @xcite : quark confinement is realized by the linear potential between a pair of a quark and an antiquark , if the wilson loop average exhibits the area decay : @xmath6 \\big\\rangle_{\\rm ym } \\sim e^{-\\sigma_{na } |s| }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] is the wilson loop operator defined by @xmath8 : =    { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\mathscr{p } \\exp \\left\\ { ig \\oint_{c } dx^\\mu \\mathscr{a}_\\mu(x ) \\right\\ } \\right ]   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in view of this , the most promising mechanism for quark confinement is believed to be the dual superconductivity , which is an idea proposed long ago @xcite .",
    "however , it was not straightforward to realize this idea in yang - mills theory to demonstrate the dual superconductivity .",
    "it was t hooft @xcite who proposed the procedure called the * abelian projection * for substantiating this idea of the dual superconductivity in the yang - mills theory : the abelian projection enables one to realize or extract magnetic monopole even in the pure yang - mills theory which does not involve the ( adjoint ) scalar field , in sharp contrast to the thooft - polyakov magnetic monopole in the georgi - glashow model .",
    "the original abelian projection is regarded as a partial gauge fixing , which breaks the original gauge group @xmath9 to the maximal torus subgroup @xmath10 .",
    "although there exist many ways to perform the partial gauge fixing @xmath11 , recent investigations have shown that quark confinement based on the dual superconductor picture can be effectively realized in a specific gauge called the * maximal abelian gauge ( mag ) * @xcite .",
    "for instance , the mag in the differential form in the continuum formulation has the form : @xmath12 a_\\mu^b(x ) = 0 \\ ( a , b=1,2 )      , $ ] for the decomposition of the su(2 ) gauge field @xmath13 into the diagonal component @xmath14 and off - diagonal ones @xmath15 distinguished by the pauli matrices @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 the non - perturbative way of imposing the mag is to minimize the functional @xmath19 with respect to the gauge transformation , just as the lorenz - landau gauge fixing is obtained from minimizing the functional @xmath20 .",
    "numerical simulations on a lattice have discovered @xcite that the abelian - projected wilson loop @xmath21 defined by the diagonal component @xmath22 alone exhibits the area decay law , if the mag is imposed on the su(2 ) yang - mills theory on a lattice : @xmath23 the most remarkable characteristics obtained in the mag are dominances in the string tension : in numerical simulations , the string tension @xmath24 obtained from the abelian wilson loop average @xmath25 reproduces almost all the value ( 95@xmath26 ) of the string tension @xmath27 obtained from the original wilson loop average @xmath28 without gauge fixing , which is called the abelian dominance in the string tension @xcite :    * * abelian dominance**@xcite @xmath29 @xmath30    moreover , if the diagonal gauge potential is decomposed into the so - called photon and monopole parts : @xmath31 , such that only the monopole part gives the non - vanishing magnetic charge , then the monopole part reproduces almost all the value ( 95@xmath26 ) of the string tension @xmath24 , which is called the monopole dominance in the string tension :    * * monopole dominance**@xcite @xmath29 @xmath32    therefore , mag is believed to be the most efficient way to perform the abelian projection to demonstrate the dual superconductivity .",
    "these results are indeed remarkable progress towards the goal of understanding quark confinement based on the dual superconductivity in yang - mills theory .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "however , we are still unsatisfactory with the following reasons .",
    "* the abelian projection and mag break su(2 ) color symmetry explicitly .",
    "+ this is inconvenient , because we consider that quark confinement should be understood as a special case of color confinement and the color confinement is well defined only if the color symmetry is preserved . if the color symmetry is broken , we lose a chance of explaining color confinement as an extension of quark confinement . *",
    "the abelian dominance has never been observed ( at least so far ) in gauge fixings other than mag in numerical simulations . +",
    "this causes the dubious impression that the dual superconductivity obtained in mag might be a gauge artifact .",
    "in order to establish the dual superconductivity as a gauge - invariant concept , we should cure these shortcomings associated with the mag . in order to reconsider the meaning of the abelian projection and the mag with the resulting abelian dominance",
    ", we consider the wilson loop operator @xmath7 $ ] for the su(n ) gauge connection @xmath33 whose vacuum expectation value is the wilson loop average @xmath34   \\rangle_{\\rm ym}$ ] .",
    "we define a _ gauge - independent abelian dominance in the su(2 ) wilson loop _ as follows .",
    "\\(i ) consider the decomposition of the original su(2 ) gauge field into two parts : @xmath35 where @xmath36 transforms just the same way as @xmath13 under the gauge transformation .",
    "then one of the variables @xmath37 does not contribute to the wilson loop operator at all , i.e. , @xmath38= { \\rm const . }",

    "i.e. , @xmath44 $ ] : @xmath45=w_s[f ]      .\\ ] ] the general su(n ) case is given later for technical reasons .",
    "for su(2 ) , the fact that the cho - faddeev - niemi - shabanov ( cfns ) decomposition @xcite for ( [ decomp-0 ] ) leads to the abelian dominance in this sense was already pointed out by cho @xcite in the continuum formulation through the non - abelian su(2 ) stokes theorem of the diakonov - petrov type @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cfns decomposition is a sufficient condition for the abelian dominance in the su(2 ) wilson loop operator .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a necessary and sufficient condition for the abelian dominance for the su(n ) wilson loop operator .",
    "then we give a constructive proof of the su(n ) version of the gauge - invariant abelian dominance for the wilson loop operator in the fundamental representation through the su(n ) non - abelian stokes theorem @xcite .",
    "consequently , the strong or exact abelian dominance holds for the wilson loop operator itself with arbitrary shape and size , not restricted to the inter quark potential derived from the wilson loop average . since the abelian projection ( [ su2-decomp ] ) is obtained as a special gauge fixing from our gauge - invariant framework , the abelian dominance in the string tension as a coefficient of the linear part in the interquark potential immediately follows from the gauge - independent abelian dominance just defined .",
    "the relationship between the wilson loop operator and magnetic monopole has been discussed in a separate paper @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we start from the lattice regularized version of the non - abelian stokes theorem and the lattice versions of the gauge field decomposition which have been constructed and developed for su(2 ) in @xcite and for su(n ) in @xcite according to the continuum versions given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in sections 2 and 4 ,",
    "then , we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for realizing the gauge - independent abelian dominance in the su(n ) wilson loop operator ( in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "moreover , we show that this condition agrees with a set of the defining equations which specify the su(n ) gauge field decomposition ( [ decomp-0 ] ) : new versions of decomposition @xcite for su(@xmath46 ) case ( @xmath47 ) , including the cfns decomposition for su(2 ) case .",
    "therefore , the strong or exact abelian dominance in the wilson loop is an immediate consequence of such decomposition ( [ decomp-0 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the exact abelian dominance gives a raison detre and a physical meaning of gauge covariant decomposition of the gauge field variable _ a l _ cfns . in section 3 ,",
    "we give some technical materials for constructing a non - abelian stokes theorem , which is extracted from @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that the exact abelian dominance in the above sense is obtained only in the continuum limit of the lattice spacing going to zero @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , there exists some deviation on a lattice coming from non - zero lattice spacing @xmath49 . in section 5 ,",
    "we give an estimation of this deviation up to @xmath50 .",
    "the constructive approach enables us to compare the result of numerical simulations with the theoretical consideration , or even give a numerical proof of the non - abelian stokes theorem .",
    "moreover this will shed new light on the role of the mag for the abelian dominance on a lattice as will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "these are advantages of the constructive proof given in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we adopt a lattice approximation in which the @xmath51-dimensional continuum spacetime @xmath52 is replaced by the @xmath51-dimensional euclidean lattice @xmath53 with a lattice spacing @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 $ ] be the parallel transporter along an oriented path @xmath56 composed of oriented links on a lattice @xmath57 . then @xmath55 $ ] is obtained by the path - ordered product of the gauge variable @xmath58 defined on each link @xmath59 .",
    "especially , the wilson loop operator for a closed loop @xmath42 on a lattice is defined by the trace of @xmath60 for a closed loop @xmath61 : @xmath62 = { \\rm tr}(u_c)/{\\rm tr}(\\bm{1 } ) ,   \\quad    u_c : = \\mathscr{p } \\prod_{\\ell \\in c }   u_\\ell    , \\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the path - ordered symbol . if the lattice spacing @xmath54 is sufficiently small , the operator @xmath64 $ ] on a lattice @xmath57 can be a good approximation for the wilson loop operator @xmath7 $ ] defined on the continuum spacetime @xmath52 .",
    "now we consider decomposing the su(n ) gauge variable @xmath65 defined on an oriented link @xmath66 into the product of two su(n ) variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 defined on the same lattice @xcite : @xmath69 in lattice gauge theories , the link variable @xmath70 obeys the well - known lattice gauge transformation : @xmath71 here we require that @xmath68 is a new link variable which transforms like a usual gauge variable on a link @xmath72 : @xmath73 for this gauge transformation to be consistent with the decomposition ( [ decomp-1 ] ) , consequently , @xmath67 must behave like an adjoint matter field at the site @xmath74 under the gauge transformation : @xmath75    the explicit form for the new lattice variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 in terms of the original link variable @xmath70 and the color field @xmath76 has been given for su(2 ) in @xcite and for su(n ) in @xcite .",
    "now we define the wilson loop operator for the decomposed variable ( [ decomp-1 ] ) .",
    "we repeat the same steps as those taken in deriving a non - abelian stokes theorem of the diakonov - petrov type for the wilson loop operator in the continuum @xcite .",

    "now we show that the abelian dominance ( [ condition ] ) follows from the requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) for the wilson loop in any representation .",
    "moreover , we show that _ a set of requirements ( i ) & ( ii ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the abelian dominance ( [ condition ] ) for the wilson loop in the fundamental representation_. we first observe that for any representation the matrix element in ( [ path - int - u ] ) reads @xmath93 while the matrix element in ( [ path - int - xv ] ) is cast into @xmath94 where we have used , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 . for @xmath9 , @xmath98 in the minimal case and @xmath99 in the maximal case .",
