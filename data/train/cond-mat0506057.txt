    "<S> the classical , square lattice , uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field parallel to the easy axis is studied using monte carlo techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the model displays a long - range ordered antiferromagnetic , an algebraically ordered spin - flop , and a paramagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations indicate that a narrow disordered phase intervenes between the ordered phases down to quite low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> results are compared to previous , partially conflicting findings on related classical models as well as the quantum variant with spin s=1/2 . </S>"
