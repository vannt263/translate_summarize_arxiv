    "we now have compelling evidence that the rate of expansion of the universe is accelerating , requiring the universe to be dominated by an unknown form of matter , known as ` dark energy , ' characterized by the equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "this dark energy could be a cosmological constant unnaturally tuned at the level of 1 part in @xmath3 @xcite , or it may be associated with the potential energy of a scalar field @xcite . if a scalar field drives the accelerated expansion then it must be extremely light , with mass of order @xmath4 . the existence of light scalar fields results in new , long range `` fifth forces , '' which are tightly constrained by experiment @xcite . to avoid these constraints the energy scale controlling the coupling of such scalar fields to matter must be many orders of magnitude larger than the planck scale @xcite . explaining why this coupling is so weak is a major problem for dynamical dark energy models .",
    "these problems can be circumvented by allowing the scalar field mass mass to be determined by a _ chameleon _ mechanism @xcite .",
    "this makes the field heavy in a dense environment , but light in vacuum .",
    "such scalar fields hide from experimental searches for fifth forces @xcite and modifications of gravity @xcite in a novel way : in the interior of a massive object the chameleon is very heavy , and has a correspondingly short interaction length .",
    "an observer outside the body feels a scalar force sourced only by a thin shell of matter at the surface of the object .",
    "this suppresses unwanted fifth forces @xcite .",
    "observations impose few constraints on the strength of the coupling of the scalar field to the standard model , allowing the energy scale of the coupling to be many orders of magnitude below the planck scale @xcite .",
    "chameleonic scalar fields have been shown to have a successful classical phenomenology .",
    "their equation of state depends on the energy density of the universe . in the early universe",
    "the chameleon behaves as an additional matter component , but at late times it has an equation of state with roughly @xmath5 .",
    "this enables it to drive an era of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "weak constraints on the initial conditions ensure that the chameleon does not disrupt the dynamics of the early universe @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss these theories in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "this is of interest because the cosmological constant problem is essentially quantum mechanical .",
    "there is no profit in replacing the cosmological constant by some other theory which is equally unnatural once quantum corrections are taken into account .",
    "the chameleon mechanism makes it mandatory for the dark energy scalar field to interact with conventional matter , and these interactions are potentially very strong .",
    "they may help us unravel the microphysics of dark energy if their indirect consequences could be measured @xcite . if the interactions are sufficiently strong , however , then an unambiguous _ direct _ consequence may be observable : new , light scalar quanta must be present in the beam pipe of any particle accelerator , raising the prospect of observing dark energy in the laboratory .",
    "fully consistent quantum mechanical realizations of the chameleon have not yet been constructed , and may suffer from the same naturalness and tuning difficulties as quintessence @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not attempt to address naturalness concerns , or the quantum - mechanical construction of the model . instead , supposing such models to exist , we determine constraints which are imposed by experiment .    real or virtual chameleon - like particles will certainly be produced in particle collisions if dark energy couples to the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "in this paper , we will provide a microscopic derivation of this coupling for any chameleon - like model .",
    "the models which furnish chameleon - like scalar particles at low energy are effective theories , valid below some energy scale @xmath6 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , corrections to electroweak precision observables from particles with chameleonic or axionic couplings were analysed , without making a commitment to any specific choice of physics at energies above @xmath6 .",
    "it was shown that very weak constraints on the energy scale of the chameleon coupling to matter ensure that the chameleon does not have an observable effect on measurements of the @xmath0-width . for processes involving fermions and @xmath7 gauge bosons",
    ", it was shown that large effects could always be absorbed into renormalizations of the fermi constant , @xmath8 , and the gauge boson masses . when higgs processes are included",
    "it is no longer clear that large effects can be hidden in this way , potentially allowing higgs production to function as a diagnostic of dark energy physics and its coupling to the standard model .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the consequences of such dark energy quanta for higgs production .",
    "this is a key target for both the _ large hadron collider _ ( lhc ) and",
    "the _ tevatron_. the details of higgs production depend on which couplings occur in the theory .",
    "to achieve a successful chameleon phenomenology we assume conformal couplings to matter .",
    "this has implications for interactions with gauge boson kinetic terms , which will be described in more detail in   [ sec : scalar - corrections ] below .",
    "the standard model gauge bosons have conformally invariant kinetic terms and develop no couplings to a scalar field of this type . in this paper",
    "we show that violations of conformal symmetry , arising from couplings to matter species , can be communicated to the kinetic term by quantum corrections .",
    "therefore , a coupling _ is _ generated at energies below @xmath6 via loops of charged heavy particles .",
    "this coupling has important phenomenological consequences which will be briefly recalled .",
    "in particular we will show that this coupling induces a coupling to the electromagnetic field and in so doing provides a motivation for the effects probed in quantum laser experiments @xcite .",
    "our results apply for any light scalars with the requisite chameleon - like couplings , whatever their origin .",
    "what scale , @xmath6 , should be associated with these new degrees of freedom ?",
    "a conservative choice would be the gut scale , @xmath9 gev , which may be connected with an early inflationary stage , or a seesaw explanation of neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "if so , heavy neutrinos of mass @xmath6 might exist but would be sterile , having no @xmath7 quantum numbers .",
    "this would not lead to the required coupling . alternatively ,",
    "if supersymmetry is realized in nature then @xmath6 could be associated with the scale at which it is spontaneously broken , perhaps of order @xmath10@xmath11 tev . in any supersymmetric completion of the standard model there",

    "( for a review see @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the mass eigenstates of these particles ( `` charginos '' ) would naturally be of order @xmath6 . in this article",
    "we remain agnostic about the nature of whatever particles circulate within loops .",
    "we give our calculation in a form which can be specialized immediately to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , but our conclusions are general and do not depend on the details of a specific implementation . in any case , the calculation we describe can be adapted easily to any heavy particle carrying the requisite quantum numbers .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : axionic ] we introduce our model and show that a coupling between gauge bosons and dark energy is generated at low energy by integrating out heavy particles .",
    "some of the phenomenology associated with this coupling is presented . in  [ sec : higgs ] we briefly review higgs production at a hadron collider , emphasizing the role of vertices between the electroweak gauge bosons and the higgs . in  [ sec : scalar - corrections ] we compute corrections to the higgs production rate arising from the low energy theory written down in  [ sec : axionic ] .",
    "we show that the effective lagrangian includes new contact interactions between the gauge bosons and the higgs . at scales smaller than @xmath13 these contact interactions resolve into heavy particle loops .",
    "we compute the correction to higgs production from both effects . in  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] we conclude by arguing that the effect of chameleon - like particles on higgs production is expected to be rather small .    throughout this paper ,",

    "we set the reduced planck mass , @xmath15 , to unity .",
    "our metric convention is @xmath16 .",
    "khoury & weltman @xcite suggested that a scalar field , @xmath17 , might evade detection and yet remain light in vacuum if it coupled to the matter species , @xmath18 , via a set of conformally rescaled metrics,[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath19 in this formula , @xmath20 is the spacetime metric , and @xmath21 is a coupling scale that is not necessarily related to the cutoff controlling the validity of the theory , @xmath6 .",

    "this requires that the effective potential has a minimum .",
    "another requirement is the existence of a _ thin shell _",
    "effect @xcite , which is realized if the scalar field potential and coupling functions are chosen in such a way that large variations in the mass of the field can occur as the matter content of the local environment changes .",
    "classical realizations of this idea have been constructed , but it is not known whether quantum realizations exist , or what condition the @xmath27 must satisfy once quantum corrections are taken into account . in what follows we will neglect the indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 for simplicity , but it is not necessary to assume that the dark energy field couples with the same strength to all matter fields .",
    "we work in the einstein frame , in which the gravitational part of the action is that of general relativity .",
    "if the scalar field couples conformally with universal strength , then a classically equivalent description can be obtained by transforming to the jordan frame in which all effects of the scalar field reappear in the gravitational sector . in the classical theory ,",
    "physical observables are independent of this choice . in the quantum theory , however , a non - trivial jacobian may be necessary to connect the einstein- and jordan - frame measures in the path integral @xcite . in this paper we work in the einstein frame from the outset , and neglect terms arising from the jacobian .",
    "these make additional contributions to the coupling between gauge - boson kinetic terms and the dark energy scalar .",
    "we hope to return to this question in a future publication .    despite appearances , chameleonic couplings of the form",
    "do not necessarily give rise to large variations in fundamental constants or particle masses @xcite .",
    "this follows because the minimum of the effective potential is a cosmological attractor .",
    "the location of the minimum drifts only slowly , owing to time evolution of the matter density .",
    "this implies that variations in the scalar - dependent particle masses and fundamental constants are correspondingly small .",
    "the kinetic terms of spin-1 particles are conformally invariant , and are left inert under the substitution @xmath31 in eq .",
    ". however , particle physics is not conformal ; any coupling to other matter species will generically break this invariance .",
    "if so , quantum corrections will cause the kinetic terms to depend on @xmath32 . in this section",

    "however , applying these constraints to chameleonic fields is not straightforward because the mass of the chameleon field depends on its environment .",

    "indeed , it is possible that certain astronomical observations may be explained most simply by including light scalars which couple as chameleons @xcite .    under certain circumstances it is possible to translate the stringent bounds obtained from electromagnetic probes , discussed above , into bounds on the matter coupling .",
    "we assume a minimal model in which the dark energy couples to matter with a uniform strength @xmath51 , irrespective of species .",

    "corrections from processes with scalar fields in the final state were shown to contribute only if the scale of the coupling is low .",

    "<S> this analysis provides additional motivation for current and near - future tests of axion - like and chameleon particles . </S>",
