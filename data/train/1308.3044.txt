    "a bouncing cosmology is a scenario in which the universe transitions from a previous contraction phase to the current expansion phase through a `` big bounce '' @xcite . in this scenario , the primordial fluctuations that seed structure formation in the early expansion phase originate from adiabatic perturbations generated in the contraction phase .",
    "these adiabatic perturbations arise as quantum fluctuations when the modes are deep inside the horizon in the early contraction phase , then become classical when they exit the horizon during the contraction phase .",
    "a large number of nearly scale invariant modes can be produced by various mechanisms in the contraction phase @xcite .",
    "these modes then have to pass through the bounce and carry on to the expansion phase .",
    "their power spectra would match current observations if the adiabatic perturbations remain nearly scale invariant after the bounce .    in a singular bounce",
    ", the universe passes through a classical singularity which must be resolved by a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the prediction of such models relies on a quantum treatment of the singular bounce @xcite .",
    "certain matching conditions can be derived from the requirement of analyticity and unitarity of the bouncing process @xcite .",
    "the alternative approach is a nonsingular bounce where the universe stops contraction and reverses to expansion at a finite size , which can be well described by classical general relativity and effective field theory @xcite .",
    "in such a smooth transition the adiabatic perturbations evolve classically and can be followed directly through the bounce .",
    "a rigorous analysis of a nonsingular bounce would help display properties and build intuition about bouncing models , especially if the outcome of the bounce does not depend sensitively on the details of the bouncing mechanism .",
    "however , there are several reasons to be concerned .",
    "first , a nonsingular bounce requires a violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) . in order for the cosmic contraction to slow down to a halt ,",
    "the effective equation of state parameter of the universe , defined by @xmath0 , must fall below @xmath1 for an extended period of time , referred to as the `` bouncing phase '' . during this bouncing phase , curvature and anisotropy , with effective equations of state @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , grow much faster than the background energy density .",
    "such unstable growth can potentially lead the universe into chaotic mixmaster behavior that disrupts the bounce altogether @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to determine if the growth of curvature and anisotropy can be kept at a finite level during the bounce .",
    "moreover , the growth of curvature perturbations during the bouncing phase may change the shape of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum is given by the amplitude of adiabatic perturbations of different wavenumbers .",
    "the adiabatic modes that exit the horizon in the contraction phase appear to reenter the horizon near the bounce , since the hubble scale @xmath4 diverges when @xmath5 at the nonsingular bounce whereas the scale factor @xmath6 remains finite .",
    "if the amplitude of the adiabatic perturbations grows during the bounce and the growth varies with wavenumber , then the power spectrum would be distorted away from scale invariance .",
    "the rapid growth of perturbations also raises the question of whether their evolution becomes nonlinear during the bouncing phase . according to a simple estimate @xcite , the adiabatic perturbations become strongly coupled when the magnitude of the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 is much larger than @xmath3 . towards a nonsingular bounce , @xmath8 approaches @xmath9 because @xmath10 goes to zero and @xmath11 is positive .",
    "if the strong coupling problem occurs , then cubic and higher order interaction terms in the action of the adiabatic perturbation become comparable to and even larger than the quadratic term .",
    "accordingly , the classical evolution of superhorizon modes may deviate from linearized equations of motion .",
    "such nonlinearity causes a mixing of modes that alters the power spectrum and induces a large non - gaussianity . to analyze the nonlinear evolution of adiabatic perturbations , a nonperturbative calculation is required",
    ".    in this paper , we present a full numerical analysis of a nonsingular bounce .",
    "classical evolution of the spacetime is followed from near the end of the contraction phase through the entire bouncing phase into the expansion phase .",
    "the einstein equations coupled with equations of motion for scalar fields are solved with inhomogeneous and anisotropic initial conditions .",
    "these inhomogeneities represent adiabatic perturbations that have exited the horizon in the earlier contraction phase and henceforth evolved classically .",
    "our purpose is to study their behavior during the nonsingular bounce .",
    "several mechanisms for creating a nonsingular bounce have been studied , which are based on effective field theories such as ghost condensation @xcite and the galileon @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms are not well - adapted for numerical simulations because the covariant generalization of the effective field theories to curved spacetime typically introduce higher derivative terms that are susceptible to numerical instability @xcite . for our computation",
    "we introduce a minimally coupled massless scalar field with a wrong - signed kinetic term  a ghost field ",
    "whose stress - energy tensor explicitly breaks the nec .",
    "such a ghost field would lead to unstable excitations of negative quanta when coupled to normal scalar fields and gravity . here",
    "we treat it purely classically as an effective way of creating a background solution that describes a nonsingular bounce ; its energy density is only significant near the bounce and otherwise negligible .",
    "the classical equation of motion for the ghost field has an identical form to that of a normal scalar field and is well - behaved for numerical computations .",
    "a similar setup has been used in the perturbative calculations of @xcite .    in our nonperturbative calculation ,",
    "the evolution of the spacetime through the bouncing phase is computed by using harmonic coordinates @xcite .",
    "compared to other numerical schemes , like the constant mean curvature gauge , the harmonic gauge does not run into coordinate singularities during the bouncing phase when @xmath6 and @xmath10 are non - monotonic in time .",
    "another advantage of using harmonic coordinates is that the equations of motion for metric components are wave - like equations that can be easily solved . to extract the amplitude of adiabatic perturbations from our numerical results ,",
    "we compute the nonlinear and covariant generalization of the curvature perturbation used in linear perturbation theory . following the covariant formalism @xcite",
    ", the generalized curvature perturbation is taken to be the integrated expansion along the integral curve of the normal vector to the constant time slices .",
    "our numerical methods are sufficiently general and robust to handle nonlinear evolution with large inhomogeneities .",
    "we show that inhomogeneity and anisotropy can disrupt the nonsingular bounce . in particular ,",
    "if the effective density of anisotropy in certain regions of the universe surpasses the energy density of the ghost field that is responsible for the bounce , then these regions will keep contracting and collapse to a singularity . on the other hand , regions of the universe that are relatively homogeneous and isotropic ( e.g. , those that underwent an ekpyrotic smoothing phase prior to the bounce )",
    "can undergo a nonsingular bounce and continue into the expansion phase .",
    "this picture is dramatically different from that obtained in linear perturbation analysis where the bounce happens everywhere and almost simultaneously .    for sufficiently small perturbations that pass through the nonsingular",
    "bounce , we study the effect of nonlinearity by measuring the mixing of fourier modes in the integrated expansion . we show that , if the amount of inhomogeneity and anisotropy is marginally below the level that would disrupt the bounce , then the nonlinear terms introduce significant deviation from linear perturbative calculations .",
    "otherwise , if the amount of inhomogeneity and anisotropy is well below the critical level , then nonlinearity is negligible throughout the bounce despite the fact that @xmath12 at the bounce .",
    "we compare our results with the condition of strong coupling , and argue that the latter problem does not occur at the classical level .",
    "we further examine how the bounce affects the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , we assume that scale invariant perturbations are generated from a matter - like contraction phase before the bounce @xcite .",
    "we find the matching condition that the amplitude of the adiabatic perturbations in the expansion phase is dominated by the contribution from the growing mode in the contraction phase .",
    "the change in the scale dependence of the amplitude through the bounce is negligible for small perturbations .",
    "the power spectrum of the adiabatic perturbations remains to be scale invariant after the bounce with no observable tilt or running .",
    "the nonsingular bouncing model is presented in section  [ sec : bouncing ] .",
    "the numerical methods for simulating the nonsingular bounce and computing nonlinear perturbations are explained in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "the results of large inhomogeneity and anisotropy are described in section  [ sec : anisotropy ] , the problem of nonlinearity and strong coupling is characterized in section  [ sec : nonlinearity ] , and the effect of the bounce on the scale dependence of the power spectrum is studied in section  [ sec : spectrum ] . for comparison , a perturbative calculation in the linear harmonic gauge",
    "is presented in appendix  [ sec : linear ] , with bunch - davies initial values given in appendix  [ sec : initial ] .",
    "conclusions and implications are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for the nonsingular bounce , we consider a model with two scalar fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 minimally coupled to gravity , described by the lagrangian @xmath15 here @xmath13 is a canonical scalar field with a potential @xmath16 , and @xmath14 is a ghost field with a wrong - signed kinetic term .",
    "the conditions are chosen so that the universe is dominated by the normal scalar field @xmath13 during the contraction phase . under such conditions ,",
    "the @xmath13 field has a scaling solution in which its energy density scales as @xmath17 with a constant equation of state @xmath18 . for @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "this solution is an attractor with @xmath21 that is used in the ekpyrotic model @xcite .",
    "here we consider the other case with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 and a nonsingular bounce can be obtained @xcite . in this case , the scaling solution is _ not _ an attractor  the initial condition must be fine - tuned in order to keep @xmath25 nearly constant for a sustained period .",
    "our computation starts near the end of the contraction phase , assuming that the @xmath13 field has @xmath25 given by the scaling solution and the @xmath14 field has negligible energy density .",
    "since the @xmath14 field has only a kinetic term , its equation of state is @xmath26 that is greater than @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the negative energy density of the @xmath14 field grows as @xmath27 during contraction , faster than the positive energy density of the @xmath13 field .",
    "eventually the total energy density vanishes and causes a nonsingular bounce , in which the contraction stops and the expansion begins",

    "our computation is based on a bouncing model with one canonical scalar field that drives a matter - like ( @xmath281 ) contraction phase and another ghost field that induces a nonsingular bounce .",

    "the anisotropy remains subdominant and does not affect the nonsingular bounce . in those cases , such as one with an amplitude consistent with observed primordial fluctuations , nonlinearities are insignificant during the bounce and the strong coupling problem does not occur for superhorizon modes , indicating that the nonsingular bounce does not cause large non - gaussianity .",
    "we have further analyzed the scale dependence of the amplitude of the adiabatic perturbations and showed that , given scale invariant amplitudes generated in the matter - like contraction phase , the power spectrum remains scale invariant in the expansion phase without observable deviations , consistent with current observational constraints .",
    "a new picture that emerges from our study is that the nonsingular bounce can happen in separate parts of the universe .",
    "specifically , regions of the universe that are overwhelmed by inhomogeneity and anisotropy collapse into singularities , whereas regions with relatively smooth and isotropic conditions pass through a nonsingular bounce .",
    "this gives a completely different global picture of a nonsingular bouncing universe from what has been expected by linear perturbative analysis .",
    "the new scenario resembles the `` phoenix universe '' model @xcite in which a contracting universe collapses in certain regions and bounces in the others , except that here the bounce is nonsingular . since the inhomogeneous regions of the universe terminate in singularities ( barring quantum effects )",
    ", the volume of the universe is dominated by the desirable regions that pass through the bounce and expand .",
    "one can further imagine that the local amplitude of the primordial fluctuations within an expanding region that bounced successfully evolves indifferently to the existence of collapsed regions that are way beyond the horizon .",
    "since the evolution of different regions of the universe can be followed through the bounce by directly solving classical equations of motion , it may be possible to find a definite probability measure for various observables over all bouncing regions .",
    "there are some drawbacks in the specific model considered in this paper , especially that the matter - like contraction is not an attractor solution .",
    "consequently , a sufficiently long period of matter - like contraction phase requires fine - tuning of initial values for the background solution .",
    "moreover , classical inhomogeneity and anisotropy grow faster than the background energy density with a matter - like equation of state , so it requires further fine - tuning to suppress inhomogeneities during the contraction phase .",
    "furthermore , although the matter - like contraction phase can create scale invariant adiabatic perturbations , the dominant mode of these perturbations that carries the scale invariant power spectrum is not conserved even on superhorizon scales ; hence the amplitude of the adiabatic perturbations in the expansion phase is different from that at the horizon crossing .",
    "the problem with the growth of inhomogeneity and anisotropy can be avoided in an ekpyrotic contraction phase .",
    "the ekpyrotic contraction is an attractor that automatically smooths away initial inhomogeneity , spatial curvature , and anisotropy @xcite . it may be possible to have such an ekpyrotic phase before ( or after , e.g. , in @xcite ) the matter - like contraction phase to provide extremely homogeneous and isotropic conditions for the latter",
    "nevertheless , the initial values for the scalar fields would still require fine - tuning in order for the homogeneous solution to stay close to the scaling solution during the entire matter - like contraction phase ; the non - conservation of the growing mode of the adiabatic perturbations outside the horizon still exists as well .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to completely replace the matter - like contraction phase by an ekpyrotic contraction phase . instead of using the matter - like contraction phase to generate scale invariant adiabatic perturbations , the latter can be generated through an entropic mechanism with the existing two scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the entropic perturbations between the two fields can be converted into adiabatic perturbations at the end of the ekpyrotic phase , which then become conserved outside the horizon . based on our results",
    ", we expect the adiabatic perturbations to evolve through the nonsingular bounce without altering the scale invariance of the power spectrum .",
    "this new scenario will be pursued elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the remaining issue is the quantum instability of the ghost field that is used to violate the nec and induce the nonsingular bounce .",
    "the ghost field serves as an effective mechanism for describing the bouncing process and studying the classical perturbations on superhorizon scales . to complete the model , the ghost field",
    "must be stabilized by some unknown uv - completion mechanism which is not considered here .",

    "<S> in bouncing cosmology , the primordial fluctuations are generated in a cosmic contraction phase before the bounce into the current expansion phase . for a nonsingular bounce , curvature and anisotropy </S>",
    "<S> grow rapidly during the bouncing phase , raising questions about the reliability of perturbative analysis . in this paper , we study the evolution of adiabatic perturbations in a nonsingular bounce by nonperturbative methods including numerical simulations of the nonsingular bounce and the covariant formalism for calculating nonlinear perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the bounce is disrupted in regions of the universe with significant inhomogeneity and anisotropy over the background energy density , but is achieved in regions that are relatively homogeneous and isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> sufficiently small perturbations , consistent with observational constraints , can pass through the nonsingular bounce with negligible alteration from nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> we follow scale invariant perturbations generated in a matter - like contraction phase through the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> their amplitude in the expansion phase is determined by the growing mode in the contraction phase , and the scale invariance is well preserved across the bounce . </S>"
