    "observational _ science , it will be crucial to avail ourselves of multiple , independent tests of , and constraints on , competing cosmological models and their parameters .",
    "furthermore , such redundancy may provide the only window on systematic errors which can impede our progress or send us off in unprofitable directions . to illustrate the efficacy of such an approach in modern cosmology , i ll track the baryon density of the universe as revealed early on ( first few minutes ) by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , later ( few hundred thousand years ) as coded in the fluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and up to the present , approximately 10 gyr after the expansion began .",
    "as theory suggests and terrestrial experiments confirm , baryon number should be preserved throughout these epochs in the evolution of the universe , so that the number of baryons ( @xmath0  nucleons ) in a comoving volume _ should _ be unchanged from bbn to today . as a surrogate for identifying a comoving volume , we may compare the baryon / nucleon density to the density of cmb relic photons .",
    "except for the additional photons produced when e@xmath1 pairs annihilate , the number of photons in our comoving volume is also preserved .",
    "as a result , the baryon density may be tracked through the evolution of the universe utilizing the nucleon - to - photon ratio @xmath2 where , n_n / n_. since the temperature of the cmb fixes the present number density of relic photons , the fraction of the critical mass / energy density in baryons today ( @xmath3 ) is directly related to @xmath2 , _ 10 10 ^ 10= 274_bh^2 , where the hubble parameter , measuring the present universal expansion rate , is h@xmath4  kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 . according to the hst key project , @xmath6 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* freedman 2001 ) ) .    for several decades",
    "now the best constraints on @xmath2 have come from the comparison of the predictions of bbn with the observational data relevant to inferring the primordial abundances of the relic nuclides d , he , he , and li . for recent reviews ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "however , the time is rapidly approaching when new data of similar accuracy will be available to probe the baryon density at later epochs .",
    "indeed , recent cmb data has very nearly achieved this goal .",
    "this same level of precision is currently lacking for the present universe estimates but , such as they are , they do permit us to compare and contrast independent estimates of @xmath2 ( or @xmath7 ) at three widely separated eras in the evolution of the universe . in the next section",
    "the bbn bounds on the nucleon density are presented and their implications for the dark baryon and dark matter problems described .",
    "next , we turn to the cmb estimates of the baryon density , comparing them to those from bbn .",
    "last ( but not least ) , we turn to an estimate of the present universe baryon density utilizing data whose interpretation avoids the need to adopt a relation between mass and light in the universe .    in recent years cosmological research has been data - driven and we have become used to looking forward with great anticipation to the latest observational results , and greedily wishing for more . be careful of what you wish for !",
    "not all the new data has led us unerringly along the right path .",
    "indeed , within a few weeks of this meeting new data became available on the cmb angular fluctuation spectrum ( halverson 2001 ; netterfield 2001 ; lee 2001 ) and on the deuterium abundance ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* levshakov , dessauges - zavadsky , dodorico , & molaro 2001 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",

    ", i will comment on the older data and their implications , while reserving the most recent observations for my conclusions regarding the baryon density of the universe .",
    "during the first few minutes in the evolution of the universe the density and temperature were sufficiently high for nuclear reactions to occur in the time available . as the universe expanded , cooled , and became more dilute , the  rolling blackout \" became permanent and the universal nuclear reactor went offline .",
    "the abundances of the light nuclei formed during this limited epoch of primordial alchemy were determined , for the most part , by the competition between the time available ( the universal expansion rate ) and the density of the reactants : nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) .",
    "the abundances predicted for nucleosynthesis in the standard cosmological model ( sbbn ) are shown ( as a function of @xmath2 ) in figure  [ fig : bbn ] .",
    "the abundances of d , he , and li are  rate limited \" , being determined by the competition between the nuclear production / destruction rates and the universal expansion rate . as such , they are sensitive to the nucleon density and have the potential to serve as  baryometers \" . in contrast , the nuclear reactions which build he are so rapid and , because its destruction is inhibited ( due to its strong binding and the lack of a stable nuclide at mass-5 ) , the helium-4 mass fraction , y , is insensitive to @xmath2 . since virtually all the neutrons available at bbn are incorporated into he , y is determined mainly by the neutron - to - proton ratio which is controlled by the competition between the weak interaction rate (  @xmath8-decay \" ) and the expansion rate . as a result , since the neutron lifetime is known very accurately , the he abundance is a sensitive probe of the early universe expansion rate .",
    "= 3.5truein      of the three relic nuclides whose primordial abundances may be probes of the baryon density ( d , he , li ) , deuterium is the baryometer of choice .",
    "first and foremost , the predicted primordial abundance has a sigificant dependence on the nucleon density ( d / h @xmath9 ) . as a result",
    ", if the primordial abundance is known to , say , 10% , then the baryon density ( @xmath2 ) can be determined to @xmath10 ; truly precision cosmology ! equally important ,",
    "as @xcite showed long ago , bbn is the only astrophysical site where an  interesting \" abundance of deuterium may be produced ( d / h @xmath11 ) ; the relic abundance is not enhanced by post - bbn production .",
    "furthermore , as primordial gas is cycled through stars , deuterium is completely destroyed ( because of the small binding energy of the deuteron , destruction occurs during the pre - main sequence evolution , when the stars are fully mixed ) . as a result , the abundance of deuterium has only decreased ( or , remained close to its primordial value ) since bbn .",

    "there is , however , one potentially serious problem associated with using deuterium as a baryometer .",
    "the atomic spectra of deuterium and hydrogen are identical , save for the isotope shift associated with the deuteron - proton mass difference . as a result , a small amount of hydrogen at the  wrong \" velocity ( an  interloper \" ) can masquerade as deuterium , so that ( d / h)_now ( d / h)_obs .",
    "[ d / h2 ] a comparison of equations [ d / h1 ] and [ d / h2 ] reveals the problem : how to relate ( d / h)@xmath12 to ( d / h)@xmath13 ?",
    "one approach is to concentrate on observing deuterium in those high redshift ( high - z ) , low metallicity ( low - z ) systems where not much gas will have been cycled through stars and the deuterium (  now \" ) should be essentially primordial ( bbn ) .",
    "if so , there should be no variation ( outside of the statistical errors ) with metallicity . to test for interlopers the best approach ( the favorite of theorists ! ) is to have lots of data .",
    "observers are making great progress towards this goal , but the road has not always been straight .    after some false starts , there were four high - z , low - z qso absorption line systems where deuterium had been detected as of the time of this symposium in april 2001 ( burles & tytler 1998a , b ; omeara 2001 ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "* webb 1997 ) ) , with possibly a much higher d / h , is widely agreed to have insufficient velocity data to rule out contamination by a hydrogen interloper ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kirkman 2001 ) ) .",
    "however , these data on d / h , displayed as a function of metallicity in figure 2 , appear to challenge our expectations ( of a low - metallicity , deuterium  plateau \" ) in that they suggest an anticorrelation between d / h and metallicity .",
    "has deuterium actually been destroyed since bbn , and is the bbn abundance at least as high as the highest data point ?",
    "this would be most surprising in such low metallicity systems ( see , jedamzik & fuller 1997 ) .",

    "it might be expected that the lower hydrogen column density absorbers could be more easily contaminated .",
    "two of the systems have relatively low h - column densities ( @xmath14@xmath15 lyman limit systems ( lls ) ) and two have considerably higher n@xmath16 ( @xmath17@xmath15 damped lyman alpha ( dla ) absorbers ) .",
    "= 3.5truein    indeed ,",
    "the hint from figure 3 is that interlopers may be playing a role in either or both of the lls .",
    "if so , perhaps we should identify only the dlas with the primordial deuterium abundance .",
    "however , given the small number of data points , this would be premature . at the symposium i adopted a weighted average ( @xmath18d / h@xmath19 ) and called for more data .",
    "observers were nt long in responding .",
    "but , i had nt anticipated what they would find .    further observations by @xcite of the @xcite absorber ( the low d / h point at the highest n@xmath16 in fig .",
    "3 ) revealed a more complex velocity structure and led to an upward revision in the derived d / h ( which , by the way , is by more than the previous statistical error estimate , reinforcing the potential for systematic errors to wreak havoc ) .",
    "so far , so good , now that the four d / h determinations are more consistent with one another , alleviating the need to invoke interloper contamination . however , in the meanwhile @xcite weighed in with a new deuterium detection in a dla .",
    "the pettini - bowen abundance is smaller than all the other determinations , indeed smaller than ( although within the errors of ) the presolar nebula abundance of @xcite . the current data ( as of july 2001 )",

    "* weinberg , miralda - escud , hernquist , & katz 1997 ) ) , it seems clear that the density of baryons in the present universe is much larger than the upper bound to luminous baryons shown in figure  [ fig : obvsh ] .",
    "we return to a different estimate of the baryon density in the present / recent universe in  [ sec : sn1a ] .",
    "the gap between the bbn band and the band labelled @xmath24 is one aspect of the classical dark matter problem : the mass density inferred from the motions of galaxies exceeds the baryon density derived from bbn . aside from those solutions which resort to modifying gravity ( sanders ( 2001 ) this volume )",
    ", the standard assumption is that this gap provides evidence for the dominance at present of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "much of this symposium was devoted to discussions of possible dark matter candidates and the means for their detection .",

    "as the universe expands and cools , the density in non - relativistic matter becomes relatively more important , eventually dominating after a few hundred thousand years . at this stage perturbations can begin to grow under the influence of gravity and , on scales determined by the relative density of baryons , oscillations in the baryon - photon fluid will develop .",
