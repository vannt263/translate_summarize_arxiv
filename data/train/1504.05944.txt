    "relying on the validity of the computing algorithms has some drawbacks as not all the proposed optimized structures are feasible to manufacture .",
    "for instance , optimized 2d antenna structures with a ground plane were reported in @xcite .",
    "their structure consisted of small pec squares and the optimization routine eliminated squares randomly from the plane optimized for minimum @xmath0 .",
    "each new design was solved using method of moments code ( mom ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-factor was calculated with single frequency simulations .",
    "some of the proposed structures have junctions with a single common point diagonally connecting adjacent pec squares .",
    "this is not the first time that optimization algorithms suggest structures which have neighbor squares with only one common point .",
    "for example a similar point crossing is reported for frequency selective surfaces @xcite . in some other works the neighbor areas overlap and make a path for the flow of current @xcite .",
    "shahpari et .",
    "al @xcite reported optimized meander line antennas based on the ant colony algorithm when radiation efficiency @xcite was involved in the pareto optimized front .",
    "these models included finite conductivity and finite width conductors . for meander line antennas in @xcite this uncertainty did not exist because continuous wires were used which could not fold and join themselves .    in this letter",
    ", we illustrate the effect of point crossing on the radiating systems .",
    "it is shown that such junctions between perfect electric conducting squares behave like an ideal open circuit in mom simulations , but imitate a short circuit in fem and fdtd modeling .",
    "however , small displacement of the cells would significantly change the flow of current over the junction and consequently change the impedance and radiation pattern of the antenna .",
    "we propose that one should avoid point crossing , but should model chamfer and bridge connections to make sure that available optimization space are properly explored .",

    "of a bent dipole with junctions illustrated in fig.[fig_cornershapes ] extracted from mom simulations ]         +      we selected a simple dipole - like structure as the first example to investigate the issue of point crossing .",
    "the structure is constructed by aligning rectangular cells in two rows which have only one point in common ( see fig .  [ fig_dipole ] ) . to examine the effect of the point crossing , we modeled other configurations including chamfering the conflicting cell , negligible shift in length and width of either of cells , or throughly connecting neighbor cells .",
    "a single point contact between two cells can not be fabricated as this is a connection point with an infinitely small cross - section between two perfectly conducting planar elements .",
    "the alternate configurations in fig .  [ fig_cornershapes ] can be considered as the potential solutions of a real junction which due to manufacturing inaccuracies cells are either shifted , or trimmed , etc .",
    "these structures were solved using a commercial mom package @xcite .",
    "[ fig_dipole_s11_junction ] compares @xmath1 for the five slightly different dipole structures . assuming the ideal point crossing case ( a ) as a reference , there is little difference with elements that are completely separated but major differences occur when the squares overlap .",

    "we modeled the dipole in fig .",

    "[ fig_dipole_s11_solver ] , fdtd and fem predict different results for the point crossing junction compared to the mom method .",
    "all 3 solvers give similar results for chamfered and bridged cases which are more practical in the real experiments .",
    "a loop antenna was investigated to show the impact of point crossing junctions on the impedance @xmath2 , current distribution @xmath3 , and the far field radiation .",
    "we considered a square loop antenna which has point crossing at two neighbor vertices and is split into one u part and one straight line ( see fig  .[fig_sqloop ] ) .",
    "[ fig_sqloop_imp ] compares the real and imaginary parts of the impedance of the square loop with point crossing , chamfered , and bridge junctions , which are simulated with mom , fdtd , and fem methods .",
    "the loop with chamfered junctions resonates around @xmath4ghz , and then changes to antiresonance around @xmath5ghz .",
    "the bridged junction has inductive impedance properties ( like a small loop ) which shows anti - resonant and resonant behaviors at @xmath6ghz and @xmath7ghz , respectively .",
    "the fdtd and fem methods are not in agreement with mom when modeling the loop with point crossing junction .",
    "it is seen that mom modeling does not allow the current flow through the junction , while fdtd and fem allow that .",
    "we believe that this disagreement is not a problem in the mom , as one never can measure such point crossing junctions .",
    "however , the significant shift from a chamfer to bridge is of particular importance .",
    "fig ,  [ fig_sqloop_j ] illustrates the impact of point crossing on the current distribution @xmath3 with different junctions with mom modeling .",
    "connecting the two areas with a single point shows a current distribution like the completely separated areas .",
    "however , a negligible degree of overlap significantly changes current to be distributed like a loop antenna fig.[fig_sqloop_j ] .",
    "the radiation pattern is also influenced by the point crossing junctions ( illustrated in fig.[fig_sqloop_ff ] ) .",
    "the current in fig.[fig_sqloop_j].(a , b ) is similar to the current distribution of a dipole with bent arms , so the radiation pattern is expected to be omnidirectional around @xmath8 axis . however , for junction types of fig.[fig_cornershapes](c - e ) , the current goes through the loop in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "this results in omnidirectional radiation around @xmath10 axis which is also validated by the simulated pattern in fig.[fig_sqloop_ff](b ) .",
    "the impact of the width of junction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_junctionwidth ] where the width of the bridge junction changes from @xmath6 mm down to @xmath11 mm .",
    "the impedance is almost the same in most of the frequency range , although it peaks to a higher value in the antiresonance region .",
    "it is also seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_sqloop_j](c - e ) that the shape of the overlapping connection does not make a significant difference to the results .",
    "it is desirable to avoid point crossing due to its impact on the performance of the antenna .",
    "avoiding such connections during optimization runs would need some schemes which ideally solves the point crossing issue with minimal modification of the geometry .",
    "one plan would be to completely purge the conflicting cells @xcite from the structure .",
    "this would avoid the issue , although the geometry modifications are not minimal . in @xcite ,",
    "conflicting cells were joined by small bridging junctions . in this letter",
