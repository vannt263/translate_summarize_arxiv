    "the aim of this paper is to extend matveev s theory of complexity from @xmath0-manifolds to @xmath0-orbifolds , and in particular , after giving the appropriate definition , to prove the following properties , established for manifolds in  @xcite :    * naturality and finiteness for irreducible orbifolds ; * additivity under orbifold connected sum .    to quickly summarize our results",
    ", we anticipate that we have fully achieved the former of these tasks , with the most natural definition of complexity . concerning the latter task , we have shown additivity to hold in a strict ( and subtle ) fashion for two of the three possible types of connected sum , and we have established a two - sided linear estimate for the third type .    we now give a more detailed account of our results .",
    "we always consider closed , orientable , locally orientable @xmath0-orbifolds . to define the _ complexity _ @xmath2 of such an @xmath3 we consider the set of simple polyhedra @xmath4 embedded in @xmath5 so that @xmath4 is transversal to the singular set @xmath6 and @xmath7 consists of disjoint open discal @xmath0-orbifolds .",
    "then we take the minimum over all @xmath4 of the number of vertices of @xmath4 plus a contribution for each intersection point between @xmath4 and @xmath6 , the contribution being @xmath8 if the order of @xmath6 at the point is @xmath9 .",
    "we can then state the naturality and finiteness properties proved below :    [ naturality : intro : teo ] with certain well - understood exceptions , if @xmath4 realizes the complexity of an irreducible orbifold @xmath3 then @xmath4 is a special polyhedron , and dual to @xmath4 there is a triangulation of @xmath3 .",
    "the number of exceptional orbifolds of each given complexity is finite .",
    "[ finiteness : intro : cor ] for each positive integer @xmath10 the set of irreducible orbifolds @xmath3 such that @xmath11 is finite .",
    "turning to additivity , first recall that the operation of connected sum of two manifolds or orbifolds consists in making a puncture in each of the given objects and then gluing the resulting boundary spheres . for manifolds , there is only one way to make the puncture , so the operation of connected sum is uniquely defined ( at least in a connected and oriented context ) . in the analogue operation for orbifolds",
    ", one has to distinguish according to the nature of the point at which the puncture is made , which can be non - singular , singular but not a vertex of the singular locus , or a vertex of the singular locus . depending on this nature ,",
    "the operation of connected sum is called of _ ordinary _ , _ cyclic _ , or _",
    "each type of operation has a corresponding identity element , given by the so - called _ ordinary _ , _ cyclic _ , and _ vertex spherical @xmath0-orbifold_. a connected sum of a certain type with the spherical @xmath0-orbifold of the same type will be called _",
    "trivial_. the following result , proved in  @xcite , is necessary to state our results on additivity .",
    "[ splitting : cite : teo ] let @xmath3 be a closed locally orientable @xmath0-orbifold .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 does not contain any bad @xmath1-suborbifold , and that every spherical @xmath1-suborbifold of @xmath3 is separating .",
    "then @xmath3 can be realized as connected sum of irreducible @xmath0-orbifolds in such a way that , even after reordering the sums , there is no trivial sum .",
    "any two such realizations involve the same irreducible summands and the same types of sums ( including orders ) .",
    "moreover , if the realization of @xmath3 does not involve vertex connected sums , for all @xmath12 the number @xmath13 of @xmath9-cyclic connected sums involving at least one singular component without vertices is independent of the realization , so it is a function of @xmath3 only .",
    "a realization of @xmath3 as described in the previous statement will be called an _ efficient connected sum_. the condition that there should not be trivial sums _ even after reordering _ is due to the existence of phenomena of the following type . if we first take the ordinary connected sum of some non - singular @xmath3 with a cyclic spherical @xmath0-orbifold , and then we take the cyclic connected sum of the result with some other @xmath14 , then both sums , taken in this order , are non - trivial , but the result is just the ordinary connected sum of @xmath3 and @xmath14 , so the two - step sum is obviously inefficient .",
    "we now have our main statement about additivity :    [ additivity : intro : teo ] let a @xmath0-orbifold @xmath3 as in theorem  [ splitting : cite : teo ] be the efficient connected sum of irreducible orbifolds @xmath15 without vertex connected sums .",
    "for @xmath12 let @xmath13 be as in theorem  [ splitting : cite : teo ] .",
    "then @xmath16    when the realization of @xmath3 includes vertex connected sums we only have two - sided linear estimates on the complexity of @xmath3 in terms of the complexity of its summands :    [ estimates : intro : teo ] let a @xmath0-orbifold @xmath3 as in theorem  [ splitting : cite : teo ] be the efficient connected sum of irreducible orbifolds @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath17    we mention that to establish the additivity properties of complexity we have developed an apparently new portion of the general theory of orbifolds , namely the notion of handle decomposition .",
    "the reader will find the details on this notion in section  [ handles : section ] , together with the analogue in the orbifold setting of haken s theory of normal surfaces with respect to handle decompositions .    as a motivation for our interest in @xmath0-orbifolds",
