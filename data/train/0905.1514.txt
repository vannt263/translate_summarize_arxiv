    "recently , there has been renewed interest in cyclic cosmologies .",
    "the motivation comes in part from general efforts to construct non - singular cosmological backgrounds ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) , in part from attempts to construct a cyclic cosmology @xcite as an extension of the ekpyrotic universe scenario @xcite .",
    "a problem which faces most attempts at constructing a cyclic cosmology and which was already pointed out by tolman @xcite is that the background cosmology can not be cyclic if the fact that entropy is generated in each cycle is taken into account ( see , however , @xcite for a recent model which partially resolves this problem ) .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the entropy of cosmological perturbations does not grow as long as the fluctuations remain well described by linear theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that each perturbation mode continues to describe a pure state if it starts out describing a pure state .    in this note",
    "we discuss a problem for cyclic cosmology which arises even in the absence of entropy generation : since on super - hubble scales the curvature fluctuations do not evolve symmetrically - they grow in the contracting phase and are constant in the expanding phase - there is a net growth of the fluctuations from period to period which destroys the cyclic nature of the cosmology .    since long wavelength modes have a wavelength which in the contracting phase is larger than the hubble radius for a longer time than short wavelength modes , the spectrum of fluctuations on super - hubble scales in the contracting phase is redder than the initial spectrum on sub - hubble scales .",
    "thus , both the amplitude and the slope of the spectrum of fluctuations changes from cycle to cycle - an effect which we call  processing of the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations \" .",
    "the reddening of the spectrum takes place in each contracting phase : the initial sub - hubble scaling of the spectrum differs from the later super - hubble scaling .",
    "the amount of reddening depends on the contraction rate of the universe and hence on the equation of state of the dominant form of matter .",
    "as noticed in @xcite , the reddening of the spectrum has the right strength to turn a vacuum spectrum on sub - hubble scales into a scale - invariant spectrum on super - hubble scales if the universe is dominated by cold matter .",
    "more specifically , on scales which exit the hubble radius in a matter - dominated phase , an initial vacuum spectrum on sub - hubble scales is converted into a scale - invariant one on super - hubble scales .",
    "this observation was used to propose the  matter bounce \" alternative to cosmological inflation for creating a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations .",
    "such a matter bounce is naturally realized @xcite in the context of the  lee - wick \" model @xcite for scalar field matter , which is a particular case of the more general quintom matter bounce scenario @xcite . modified gravity theories such as the biswas et al .",
    "@xcite ghost - free higher derivative gravity theory or hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite on spatially non - flat spatial sections can also lead to matter bounce scenarios , as studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this note",
    "we will compute the change in the amplitude and slope of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations from one cycle to the next .",
    "we begin with a short review of the relevant formalism .",
    "then , we compute the change in the spectrum of cosmological perturbations from one cycle to the next .",
    "we postulate the existence of a cyclic background cosmology .",
    "the turnaround between the expanding phase and the contracting phase at large radius could be generated by a spatial curvature term ( in the absence of a cosmological constant ) , for the turnaround between the contracting phase and the expanding phase new ultraviolet ( uv ) physics which violates the weak energy condition is required . in the context of the einstein field equations ,",
    "such new uv physics can be modeled by quintom matter @xcite .",
    "asymptotically free higher derivative gravity actions such as the ones proposed in @xcite can also lead to a non - singular bounce .",
    "finally , in a background with non - vanishing spatial curvature , hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite can also lead to a bounce under the conditions on matter spelled out in @xcite .    in figure 1",
    "we present a space - time sketch of a cyclic cosmology .",
    "we choose the origin of the time coordinate ( vertical axis ) to coincide with a bounce point .",
    "the equations simplify if we work in terms of conformal time @xmath0 which is related to the physical time @xmath1 via @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the scale factor . during the time interval between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the new uv physics which yields",
    "the non - singular bounce is dominant , for other times the effective equations of motion for gravity are assumed to reduce to those of einstein gravity .    )",
    "denotes the hubble radius @xmath6 , the vertical line labelled by @xmath7 represents the wavelength of a perturbation mode which exits the hubble radius at the time @xmath8 .",
    "the origin of the time axis is chosen to be the non - singular bounce point ( around the bounce the hubble radius diverges to infinity , an effect not shown on the graph .",
    "the time @xmath9 is the turnaround from the expanding phase to the contracting phase . ]",
    "the horizontal axis in figure 1 denotes co - moving distance @xmath10 .",
    "the vertical line corresponds to the wavelength of a cosmological fluctuation mode .",
    "this mode crosses the hubble radius ( the dashed curve ) at times @xmath11 .    in the presence of cosmological perturbations without anisotropic stress ,",
    "the metric in longitudinal gauge takes the form ds^2 = a^2 ( ) , where the function @xmath12 describes the fluctuations ( see e.g. @xcite for a review of the theory of cosmological perturbations ) .",
    "we are interested in computing the spectrum of @xmath13 , the function describing the curvature fluctuations in co - moving coordinates .",
    "@xmath13 is given in terms of @xmath14 via = ( ^ + ) + , @xmath15 denoting the hubble expansion rate in conformal time , a prime indicating the derivative with respect of @xmath0 , and @xmath16 being the equation of state parameter of matter ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are pressure and energy density , respectively ) .",
    "the variable @xmath13 in turn is closely related to the variable @xmath19 @xcite in terms of which the action for cosmological fluctuations has canonical kinetic term : = . here , @xmath20 is a function of the background which for constant equation of state is proportional to the scale factor @xmath3 .    at linear order in perturbation theory , the equation of motion for the fourier mode @xmath21 of @xmath19",
    "is that of a harmonic oscillator with a mass whose time - dependence is given by the background cosmology : [ eom ] v_k^  + ( k^2 - ) v_k = 0 .",
    "this shows that , whereas on sub - hubble scales @xmath21 is oscillating with approximately constant amplitude , on length scales larger than the hubble radius ( where the @xmath22 term is negligible ) the oscillations of @xmath19 freeze out and the time - dependence of @xmath19 is given by that of the background .",
    "one of the solutions of ( [ eom ] ) on super - hubble scales evolves as @xmath23 and corresponds to a constant value of @xmath13 .",
    "the second mode of @xmath19 corresponds to a decreasing mode of @xmath13 in an expanding universe . on the other hand , in a contracting phase it corresponds to an increasing mode .",
    "we see that the evolution of the curvature fluctuation @xmath13 is asymmetric between the contracting phase and the expanding phase .",
    "the dominant mode is constant on super - hubble scales in the expanding phase whereas it is increasing in the contracting phase .",
    "it is this asymmetry which is responsible for the processing of the spectrum of fluctuations in a cyclic background cosmology .",
    "in this section , we will study the processing of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations from one cycle to the next . we will consider scales for which the background is expanding ( or contracting ) as a power of time : a(t ) ~ t^p . in this case , the solutions of ( [ eom ] ) are given by v ( ) ~ ^ with [ alpha ] = , = .",
    "we are interested in the range of values @xmath24 for which @xmath25 is a negative number . in the contracting phase prior to the bounce at @xmath26 , the dominant solution of ( [ eom ] ) thus scales as [ res ] v_k ( ) ~ ^1/2 + ~ ^ .",
    "there are two cases of special interest .",
    "first , in a matter - dominated universe @xmath27 and hence the dominant mode of @xmath21 scales as v_k ( ) ~ ^-1 , whereas in a universe dominated by relativistic radiation @xmath28 and hence v_k ( ) ~ const .",
    "in fact , from ( [ res ] ) we see that for matter with an equation of state @xmath29 the amplitude of @xmath19 is decreasing as the bounce is approached , whereas for @xmath30 the amplitude is increasing .",
    "we will focus on the more physical second case .",
    "let us assume initial conditions for fluctuations on sub - hubble scales at some initial time @xmath31 long before the bounce point : v_k(- _ i ) = z(- _",
    "i ) a_i^1/2 k^-3/2 ( ) ^(n_i - 1)/2 , where @xmath32 is the initial amplitude of the spectrum of @xmath13 , @xmath33 is the initial slope , and @xmath34 is the pivot scale . our aim is to calculate the amplitude @xmath35 and slope @xmath36 after one cycle .    making use of the fact that @xmath21 oscillates until the time @xmath37 when the wavelength exits the hubble radius and subsequently increases in amplitude as given by ( [ res ] ) , we see that at the time @xmath4 immediately before the bounce , the time when the weak energy violating effects which yield the non - singular bounce start to dominate , the amplitude of @xmath21 is given by v_k(-_c ) = ( ) ^(2p -1)/(1 - p ) v_k(_i ) . making use of the hubble radius crossing condition [ scaling ] _",
    "h(k ) ~ k^-1 , we obtain the following power spectrum of @xmath13 just before the bounce : [ res1 ] p_(k , -_c ) & & ( ) ^2 ( _ c k ) ^-2(2p -1)/(1 -p ) a_i ( ) ^n_i - 1 + & = & a_f ( ) ^n_f- 1 , with [ schange ] n_f = n_i - 2 and [ achange ] a_f = ( ) ^2 a_i ( _ c k_0 ) ^-2(2p -1)/(1 -p ) .",
    "the next step of the analysis is to follow @xmath21 through the non - singular bounce from time @xmath38 to @xmath5 . the first approach to do",
    "this would be to match the values of the fluctuations at the two times using the hwang - vishniac @xcite ( see also @xcite ) matching conditions .",
    "however , the applicability of this prescription is questionable @xcite since the background does not satisfy these matching conditions . in the case of",
    "a non - singular bounce we can , however , follow the evolution of the fluctuations through the bounce explicitly , assuming the validity of the einstein equations for the fluctuations . since we are dealing with modes which are in the far infrared ( even at the bounce point ) compared to the characteristic scale of the bounce",
    ", this assumption is a safe one to make ( as has been verified explicitly in @xcite for the bounce model of @xcite ) .",
    "the lesson that has been learned by following fluctuations through the bounce in several models @xcite is that the spectrum of @xmath21 does not change on scales for which the wavelength is long compared to the duration of the bounce .",
    "this is clearly satisfied for the case of interest to us .    in the expanding phase ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath39 is constant on super - hubble scales .",
    "after the wavelength re - enters the hubble radius , the amplitude of @xmath21 does not change until the mode leaves the hubble radius once more in the contracting phase of the following cycle . to obtain the change in the spectrum of cosmological perturbations , we need to evaluate the spectrum of fluctuations at the time @xmath40 , the mirror image of the initial time",
    ". the spectrum at @xmath40 will be identical to the spectrum at the time corresponding to @xmath31 in the next cycle .",
    "to compute this spectrum , note that the amplitude of @xmath39 is decreasing between the time @xmath41 when the mode re - enters the hubble radius and the time @xmath40 since it is @xmath21 which has constant amplitude during this time interval .",
    "thus p_(k , _",
    "i ) = ( ) ^2 p_(k , _ c ) . making use of the fact that @xmath42 scales as @xmath43 and of the relations ( [ res1 ] ) and ( [ achange ] ) we find [ res2 ] p_(k , _",
    "i ) & = & ( ) ^2p/(1-p ) ( _ c k_0 ) ^-2 a_i ( ) ^n_f - 1 + & = & a_f ( ) ^n_f - 1 , with [ schange2 ] n_f = n_i - 2 and [ achange2 ] a_f = a_i ( _ c k_0 ) ^-2(3p -1)/(1 -p ) .    the results ( [ schange2 ] ) and ( [ achange2 ] ) give the change in the slope and in the amplitude of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations from one cycle to the next .",
    "each cycle leads to a reddening of the spectrum and to an increase in its amplitude .",
    "the slope changes by @xmath44 , the increase in amplitude soon leads to a breakdown of the validity of the perturbative analysis , with consequences for the multiverse discussed in @xcite    as mentioned in the introduction , if @xmath27 , then an initial vacuum spectrum ( @xmath45 ) on sub - hubble scales is transformed into a scale - invariant spectrum after the bounce .",
    "if we want an initial poisson spectrum ( @xmath46 ) to be transformed into a scale - invariant spectrum after one complete cycle in the second expanding phase , the background needs to satisfy @xmath47 , i.e. an equation of state close to that of radiation .",
    "this is a simple application of the processing of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations which we have discussed here .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the linear cosmological fluctuations from one cycle to the next in a cosmology with a periodic background . due to the asymmetry in the evolution of fluctuations in the contracting and expanding phases",
    ", there is a large increase in the amplitude of the perturbations from one bounce to the next .",
    "in addition , there is a characteristic reddening of the shape of the spectrum .",
    "the characteristic processing of the slope of the spectrum of perturbations which we discuss in this note in principle opens up new avenues of generating a scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations during a specific cycle .",
    "for example , a matter - dominated background with a spectrum with an initial steep blue index @xmath48 will yield a scale - invariant spectrum after two bounces , in the same way that an initial vacuum spectrum with @xmath49 yields a scale - invariant spectrum after one bounce @xcite .",
    "the processing of fluctuations also opens up new ways of generating a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations starting from thermal inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "note that a characteristic feature of such scenarios are large non - gaussianities with a particular shape , as worked out in @xcite .",
    "however , the increase in the amplitude of the fluctuations quickly leads to a breakdown of the linear analysis .",
    "the nonlinear evolution will then lead to entropy production and to the usual problems for cyclic background cosmologies first discussed in @xcite .",
    "we should note that the cyclic version @xcite of the ekpyrotic universe scenario does not suffer from the problems discussed here since the scale factor of  our \" universe in the ekpyrotic model @xcite is not cyclic .",
    "the only cyclicity in the ekpyrotic scenario is in the evolution of the distance between the two boundary branes .",
    "the scale factor of our universe is monotonically increasing .",
    "thus , perturbations produced at a fixed physical scale in one  cycle \" are redshifted by the time the next  cycle \" arrives .",
