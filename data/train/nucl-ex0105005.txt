    "sub - threshold @xmath0 production as well as an apparently reduced @xmath3 annihilation cross section in the nucleus have been under debate since the discovery of the @xmath0 and until recently  @xcite .",
    "the observation of enhanced antimatter production has been proposed as a signature of the quark gluon plasma  @xcite . due to the annihilation of antibaryons in baryon - rich nuclear matter",
    ", it has also been proposed to use @xmath0 yields as a measure of the baryon density in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "these interesting prospects for using antibaryons to help determine the properties of the hot , dense phase in a heavy ion collision require a deeper understanding of both the production and reabsorption of the @xmath0 within the nucleus .",
    "proton - nucleus collisions provide a cleaner environment for testing @xmath0 production and reabsorption within the nucleus than heavy ion collisions . in this paper , we present measurements of @xmath0 production in @xmath4a collisions at the ags that may help address the questions of production and reabsorption in the nucleus .",
    "the e910 apparatus has been described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the time - of - flight ( tof ) wall , used to identify the @xmath0 , is located approximately 8  m from the target and covers approximately 5@xmath52  m@xmath6 . using the measured times of flight to identify particles ,",
    "the @xmath0 band is well separated from the pions and kaons up to 3.5 gev / c .",
    "momentum dependent cuts on the number of standard deviations of the measured tof from the expected tof of a proton are applied . to reduce background in the identified @xmath0 sample , we apply cuts on the particle s ionization energy loss in the tpc and the measured photoelectrons in the cerenkov detector .",
    "quality cuts on the hits on the tof include a cut on the difference in horizontal position between a projected track and the center of the hit tof slat and a cut on the energy deposited on the tof slat .",
    "tracks are matched to the tof wall with a 90@xmath75% efficiency .",
    "we estimate and subtract a momentum - dependent background of approximately 5% .",
    "feeddown from @xmath2 in our @xmath0 sample is estimated to be less than 5% .",
    "the data have been acceptance corrected within our @xmath8 coverage , and corrected for the efficiencies of the cuts mentioned above .",
    "all results are shown within our @xmath8 coverage , @xmath9 and @xmath10  mev / c .",
    "the @xmath0 yields are shown in fig .  [ data_target ] . we observe a strong increase in @xmath4au @xmath0 yields from beam momentum 12.3 to 17.5  gev /",
    "c as expected , since production of @xmath0 near threshold should depend sensitively on the available phase space .",
    "although the likelihood of producing a @xmath0 may be greater in a larger nucleus  @xcite , the likelihood of reabsorption is also greater in the presence of more baryons .",
    "these two countervailing effects can be studied by investigating the target dependence of @xmath0 yields .",
    "results for be , cu , and au at beam momentum 12.3  gev / c are also shown in fig .",
    "[ data_target ] .",
    "[ data_target ]    [ data_int ]    figure  [ data_int ] shows the integrated rapidity densities for all four data sets .",
    "the yields decrease from @xmath4be to @xmath4au collisions by 34  @xmath7  22% .",
    "by characterizing collision `` centrality , '' e910 can provide new insight into @xmath0 absorption .",
    "events are characterized by the mean number of collisions @xmath1 that the projectile undergoes within the nucleus ( as determined by the number of `` grey '' tracks @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of the mean @xmath0 multiplicity in 17.5  gev / c @xmath4au collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ au18_nu ] . a preliminary measurement of the mean @xmath2 multiplicity as a function of @xmath1 is also shown in fig .  [ au18_lambda_nu ] .",
    "the mean multiplicity of both tends to decrease as @xmath1 increases . although not convincingly significant , the increase from @xmath12 to @xmath13 in the mean @xmath0 yield may be evident of a contribution to production beyond the first @xmath4n collision .",
    "the increase is more pronounced in the mean @xmath2 yield versus @xmath1 and thus strengthens the evidence for production beyond a first collision model . with the following assumptions ,",
    "we quantify the `` effective '' absorption cross section in the nucleus and show that it is greatly reduced relative to the free @xmath3 annihilation cross section .",
    "the first assumption is that the @xmath0 is predominantly produced in the first @xmath4n collision .",
    "since the beam energy is near the production threshold , this is generally assumed to be true at ags energies  @xcite .",
    "if there are contributions to production beyond @xmath14 , as we have conjectured , they are not large enough to change our conclusion dramatically .",
    "the second assumption is that the @xmath0 follows the path of the projectile through the nuclear matter .",
    "this is also a reasonable assumption because we observe strongly forward - peaked angular distributions for the @xmath0 .",
    "then the survival probability of the @xmath0 can be described by the following equation ( although one should note that a formation time is not taken into account by this description ) , @xmath15 since the value @xmath1 plotted on the x - axis of figs .",
    "[ au18_nu ] and  [ au18_lambda_nu ] is simply an average value , @xmath16 , and each value of @xmath11 actually has a distribution of @xmath1 values associated with it , @xmath17 , we fold the above exponential with @xmath17 .",
    "we determine @xmath18 by fitting with , @xmath19 in one fit , the first data point is not included ( because of the initial increase in yield from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) , and in the second fit , the @xmath12 point is included .",
    "the parameter , @xmath20 , resulting from the fit is @xmath21 when neglecting the first data point in the fit , and @xmath22 when including it . taking the more conservative estimate of 0.23 and assuming @xmath23 to be 30  mb , one obtains an absorption cross section , @xmath18 , of @xmath24  mb . at @xmath25  gev / c , the mean measured momentum of the @xmath0 sample we detect , this is approximately @xmath26 of the free annihilation cross section  @xcite , @xmath27 .",
    "the large discrepancy between @xmath18 , as derived from our model , and @xmath27 suggests a modification of the @xmath3 annihilation cross section within the nuclear medium .",
    "figure  [ au18_lambda_nu ] shows a very similar dependence of the mean @xmath2 yield on @xmath1 .",
    "fitting with the same function that was used for the @xmath0 yields , the extracted fit parameter is @xmath28 .",
    "the effective absorption cross section is thus the same ( within errors ) for @xmath2 as for @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests an intermediate state that emerges from the nuclear medium as a @xmath0 or a @xmath2 .",
    "[ au18_nu ]    [ au18_lambda_nu ]",
    "we have found that , at ags energies , the @xmath0 yields dramatically increase with beam momentum and moderately decrease with increasing target size .",
    "we have found evidence that even at these beam momenta , near the production threshold of the @xmath0 and the @xmath2 , there is production beyond the first @xmath4n collision for the @xmath2 , and a similar behavior for the @xmath0 is not excluded .",
    "finally , the `` effective '' absorption cross section , calculated within the context of a simple model , is significantly reduced relative to the free @xmath3 annihilation cross section . the similarity between the calculated absorption cross sections for",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath2 may indicate the presence of a single intermediate state which leads to both final states ."
