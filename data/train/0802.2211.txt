    "the dynamics of chains of coupled particles has been the object of a huge number of studies , but only recently some numerical works ( see @xcite ) have shown that the boundary conditions have some relevance on fpu type investigations .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to study analytically the effects of the boundary conditions ( bc ) on the dynamics of a simple 1-dimensional model , namely the so called klein gordon lattice ( coupled particles subjected to an on site restoring force ) .",
    "precisely , we concentrate on the cases of periodic and of dirichlet boundary conditions , and use the methods of normal form to study the dynamics .",
    "this leads to a quite clear understanding of the role of the boundary conditions and to an explanation of the numerical results of @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "our theory does not allow one to explain the results of @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we study the dynamics of a large lattice corresponding to small amplitude initial data with long wavelength ; we show that if the size @xmath0 is large enough and the amplitude @xmath1 of the initial excitation is of order @xmath2 , then the solution @xmath3 has the form @xmath4 up to times @xmath5 . in @xmath6 is interpolated by a solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) and has a behaviour which is independent of the bc . on the contrary",
    "@xmath7 depends on the bc .",
    "precisely , its fourier coefficients decrease exponentially in the periodic case , but only as @xmath8 in the dirichlet case .",
    "the theory we develop in order to give the representation provides a clear interpretation of the phenomenon .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the normal form of the system is independent of the bc ( and coincides with the nls ) , but the coordinate transformation introducing the normal form has properties which are different in the periodic and in the dirichlet case . in particular , in the dirichlet case",
    "it maps sequences which decay fast into sequences which decay as @xmath8 .",
    "this introduces the slow decay in the dirichlet case .",
    "it should be pointed out that our result still depends on the size @xmath0 of the lattice .",
    ", independently of n. the limitation @xmath9 comes from the fact that we are only able to study the dynamics of the nls in this situation . ] nevertheless , we think that ( within the range of validity of our result ) we clearly show the role of the boundary conditions and provide a good interpretation of the numerical results .",
    "the present situation has many similarities with the one occurring in the theory of the navier stokes equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where it is well known that the spectrum of the solution depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , we recall that a power law decay of localized object has been previously observed in nonlinear lattice dynamics in @xcite and that the connection between the nonlinear schrdinger equation and the dynamics of long chains of particles was studied in many papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",

    "[ s.3 ] we give the proof of the normal form construction . in sect .",
    "[ s.4 ] we give the proof of the decomposition .",
    "some technical details are deferred to the appendix .",
    "each section is split into several subsections .    _",
    "_ this work was partially supported by miur under the project cofin2005 `` sistemi dinamici nonlineari e applicazioni fisiche '' .",
    "we thank antonio ponno , luigi galgani and simone paleari for many discussion and suggestions during the preparation of this paper .",
    "we also thank sergej flach and michel peyrard for some interesting discussion .",
    "in this chapter we present the model , we recall some numerical simulations ( see @xcite ) which clearly show the dependence of the metastable fourier decay on the boundary conditions and we finally state the main theoretical result and use it to explain the numerics .",
    "we consider a chain of particles described by the hamiltonian function @xmath10 where @xmath11 runs from @xmath12 to @xmath0 in the case of dirichlet boundary conditions ( dbc ) , namely @xmath13 , while it runs from @xmath14 to @xmath0 in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding hamilton equations are @xmath16 we recall that the standard fermi pasta ulam model is obtained by taking @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here",
    "instead we will take @xmath19 explicitly our hamiltonian has the form @xmath20    [ r.2 ] in the case where @xmath21 the equations with pbc are invariant under the involution @xmath22 , @xmath23 . as a consequence the submanifold of the periodic sequences which are also skew - symmetric , is invariant under the dynamics .",
    "for this reason when is fulfilled the case of dbc is just a subcase of the case of pbc .",
    "this happens in the standard fpu model and also in the case of the hamiltonian with the potential and @xmath24 .",
    "the case @xmath25 is the simplest one where a difference between dbc and pbc is possible .",
    "consider the vectors @xmath26 then the fourier basis is formed by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the case of dbc , and by @xmath27 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the case of pbc . here",
    "we will treat in a unified way both the cases of dbc and pbc , thus we will not specify the set where the indexes @xmath11 and @xmath32 vary .",
    "introducing the rescaled fourier variables @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 where the frequencies are defined by @xmath35 the hamiltonian @xmath36 is changed to @xmath37      let us define the energy of a normal mode and its time average by @xmath38 in the case of pbc the oscillators of index @xmath32 and @xmath39 are in resonance , so the relevant quantity to be observed is the average @xmath40 .",
    "take an initial datum with all the energy concentrated on the first fourier mode with energy density @xmath41 . integrating the system",
    "numerically one can see that after a short transient the time averages of the harmonic energies relax to well defined steady values , which persist for very long times . in figures [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot in a semi - log scale the time - average energies @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) at time @xmath44 ( subsequent to the relaxation time ) as a function of the index @xmath32 .",
    "the parameters in the two panels are @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . in both the cases @xmath47 . in each distribution",
    "the dots refer to the dbc case while the crosses pertain the pbc one .    while in panel ( b )",
    "one clearly observes a perfect overlapping of the exponential part of the decays , in panel ( a ) a sharp difference arises .",
    "indeed , while the pbc solution is once more characterized by an exponential distribution , in the case of dbc one sees a richer behavior : at an energy approximately equal to @xmath48 there is crossover and a new regime appears .",
    "nevertheless , a striking similarity among the exponential part of the two dynamics is evident .    to describe more carefully the situation in the case of dbc we plot in figures [ fig3 ] four different distributions of the quantities @xmath49 , in a semi - log and in a log - log scale respectively .",
    "they correspond to different values of the energy density ( see the caption ) . in the first panel",
    "we plot the first part of the distribution : we notice that by decreasing the energy density , the slope of the exponential decay of the low frequencies increases . in the second figure , instead",
    ", we focus our attention on the second part of the distribution : we see that the corresponding curves are parallel .",
    "so a change of energy only induces a translation .",
    "except for the last part , that we will interpret as due to discreteness effects , the curves are very well interpolated by a straight line giving a power decay with an exponent close to @xmath50 .",
    "a similar behavior is also obtained if one excites a few modes of large wave length .      in order to state our main result",
    "we need a topology in the phase space .",
    "[ phasespace ] let us define the spaces @xmath51 of the sequences @xmath52 s.t .",

    "the above theorems provide the interpretation for the numerical results of the previous paragraph .",
    "referring to fig .  1 , we identify the exponential part of the distribution as due to the main part of the solution , namely @xmath6 , which is the same for both the boundary conditions . in the case of pbc",
    ", the inequality implies that also the error @xmath90 is exponentially decreasing ; thus the whole solution is in particular exponentially localized in fourier space .    in the case of dbc",
    "the situation is different .",
    "indeed the correction , namely @xmath90 , is ensured to have coefficients such that the series with general term @xmath91 is convergent ; this is very close to say that @xmath92 which , taking @xmath93 very close to @xmath94 essentially gives a power law decay like @xmath95 .",
    "then theorem [ t.22.1 ] shows that this is actually optimal , as seen by taking @xmath96 ( as in the numerical computations ) .",
    "indeed in such a case one has @xmath97 so that shows that after a time of order 1 the energy of the @xmath32-th mode is of order @xmath98 as shown by the numerics .",
    "in this part we introduce and use the methods of the normal form theory for the proof of our main result .",
    "accordingly one looks for a canonical transformation putting the system in a simpler form .",
    "we first need to introduce some notations :    * @xmath3 will denote a phase point .",
    "in particular a phase point can be represented using the coordinates @xmath99 of the lattice s particles or the fourier coordinates @xmath100 .",
