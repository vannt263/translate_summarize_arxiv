    "a remarkable diversity of planetary systems has been uncovered in recent years through studies of extra - solar planets ( mayor & queloz 1995 , marcy & butler 1998 , perryman 2000 ) .",
    "many further studies will be required to obtain a full understanding of this diversity of planetary systems and their formation processes . in this paper",
    "we report a study of extra - solar planetary systems using a gravitational microlensing technique .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table1 ]    mao and paczynski ( 1991 ) pointed out that extra - solar planets could be detected using gravitational microlensing , because the characteristic scale in gravitational microlensing happens to coincide quite closely with the characteristic size of the solar system .",
    "the characteristic scale of gravitational microlensing is the radius of the einstein ring , @xmath5 , which is @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the mass of the lens , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the distances from the observer to lens , lens to source and observer to source respectively . for microlensing events that occur in the galactic bulge",
    ", @xmath11 is typically @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are typically about 6 kpc , 2 kpc and 8 kpc respectively .",
    "these values imply @xmath16 1.9 au . consequently , if other planetary systems have the same characteristic size as ours , planets orbiting a lens star may perturb the lensing , because light from the source star may pass close to one or more of the planets at some time during a microlensing event .",
    "gould & loeb ( 1992 ) and bolatto & falco ( 1994 ) showed that jupiter - like planets could be detected with about 20% efficiency in typical microlensing events if they are monitored at about hourly intervals with a photometric precision of a few per cent throughout each event .",
    "the planet collaboration has used this technique to set an upper limit on the abundance of jupiter - like planets of order 30% ( albrow et al .",
    "this result is consistent with results obtained independently by radial velocity and transit measurements ( marcy & butler 1998 , charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 , henry et al .",
    "2000 , jha et al .",
    "bennett & rhie ( 2000 ) emphasized the detectability of terrestrial planets by microlensing where they showed that earth - mass planets could be detected with about 5% efficiency in typical events if they are monitored hourly at a photometric precision of better than 1% .",
    "a modification of the gravitational microlensing plant search strategy was pointed out by griest & safizadeh ( 1998 ) in which planets , including those less massive than jupiter , could be detected with high efficiency in microlensing events of high magnification .",
    "this occurs when the distance of closest approach of the lens star to the line - of - sight to the source star , @xmath17 , is much smaller than the einstein radius , i.e. when @xmath18 where @xmath17 is expressed in units of @xmath19 . in these events",
    "a circular , or near - circular , image generally forms around the lens with radius @xmath19 at the time of maximum amplification , and the maximum amplification @xmath20 . if a planet is orbiting the lens star at a projected radius of about a few au at the time of an event , it will perturb the image , although the perturbation will be small because most of the image will lie far from the planet and remain unperturbed . for planets with masses as low as that of earth ,",
    "simulations show ( see  5 below ) that the perturbation may nevertheless be detectable with appropriate observations .",
    "the aim of the present study was to exploit this sensitivity .",
    "the first analysis of a high amplification event in terms of planets was reported by rhie et al .",
    "these authors reported a low - mass planetary signal ( few earth masses to few uranus masses ) at a marginal level of confidence for the event macho  98blg35 , and excluded jovian planets over an extensive region surrounding the lens star .",
    "they also pointed out that further such results in additional events would provide statistically significant constraints on the abundance of earth - mass planets , but that more accurate planetary parameters can be obtained in events in which a `` planetary caustic '' is crossed or approached , which generally occurs at lower magnifications .",
    "in this paper we report a re - analysis of macho  98blg35 , where the data in rhie et al ( 2000 ) obtained by moa have been analysed using an improved technique based on image subtraction and the inclusion of additional data .",
    "we also report analyses of two more events of high magnification , macho  99lmc2 and ogle  00bul12 .",
    "we note that the event macho  99lmc2 coincides with the event ogle 99lmc1 that was found independently by the ogle group .",
    "data from the moa ( abe et al .",
    "1997 ) , ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1997 ) , mps ( bennett et al . 1999 ) and planet ( albrow et al . 2001 ) microlensing groups were used in the present analysis .",
    "the datasets are summarized in table  1 . wherever possible , we attempted to obtain actual images and analyse these using an image subtraction procedure to achieve optimum photometric precision in the dense stellar fields in which microlensing is observed .",
    "the reduced datasets so obtained are posted at the moa website .",
    "observations of macho  98blg35 and macho  99lmc2 by moa were made with the cameras moa - cam1 and moa - cam2 respectively ( yanagisawa et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we note here that moa - cam2 was operating in a slightly non - linear mode during 1999 , and that the moa data on macho  99-lmc-2 were corrected for this on a pixel - by - pixel basis using linearly calibrated stars from observations made in 2000 .",
    "datasets on macho  98blg35 by the mps and planet groups were included in the present analysis .",
    "these datasets were reduced by these groups using the dophot procedure of schechter et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and posted at their websites . in the case of the mps dataset , it is the same dataset that was used previously by rhie et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in the case of the planet dataset ,",
    "the data used here were obtained by extracting the unpublished , graphical data at the planet website , and allowing for a time offset of 0.007 day ( a. gould , private communication , 2000 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the graphical extraction was much better than the error bars on the data .",
    "this may be seen by comparing the planet data shown in fig .",
    "10 of the present paper ( see below ) with fig .",
    "19 of their subsequent publication ( gaudi et al 2002 ) .",
    "the need for the time offset , which was presumably caused by a heliocentric correction and/or simple clock errors of a few minutes , became clearly evident from comparisons of the raw planet and raw mps / moa datasets for the event",
    "the observations listed in table  1 by the moa and ogle groups were reduced by an image subtraction procedure .",
    "data from each telescope in each passband were treated as separate datasets . for each dataset",
    ", the flatfielded images were first geometrically aligned to an astrometric reference chosen from amongst the best seeing images . a reference image for the image subtraction process",
    "was then formed by stacking the very best seeing and signal - to - noise images . the convolution kernel which relates the seeing on the reference image to that for a particular image",
    "was then determined using our own implementation of the technique of alard & lupton ( 1998 ) for modeling the kernel along with the modification of alard ( 1999 ) which models the spatial variations of the kernel across the ccd field of view .",
    "photometry on the subsequent dataset of subtracted images was carried out by first constructing an empirical point - spread - function ( psf ) on the reference image using 56 bright , isolated stars near the event .",
    "a psf for a particular image was then formed by convolving the reference psf with the appropriate kernel .",
    "this psf was fitted to the flux profile on the subtracted image at the position of a star to obtain a `` delta - flux '' measurement , @xmath21 .",
    "the fit was done by re - aligning the centroid of the empirical psf to that of the @xmath21 profile on the subtracted image , and performing a least squares fit to the pixel by pixel cross - plot of the two profiles .",
    "typical fits are shown in fig .  [ profile ] .",

    "[ profile ] provides an indicator of the quality of the image subtractions .",
    "we used the standard deviation from the best fit straight line as a measurement of the subtraction quality associated with a given @xmath21 measurement . in a good quality subtraction",
    ", the profile of an object on the subtracted image should match that of the psf on the unsubtracted image , and thus have a low standard deviation .",
    "uncertainties in the @xmath21 measurements for any object were determined empirically .",
    "the profile fitting technique was applied to the positions of all resolved stars in the field .",
    "the frame - to - frame statistical errors for any particular object were then determined from the scatter in the @xmath21 values for stars with similar profile standard deviations .",
    "stars close to the microlensing events were selected as checks .",

    "[ checks1 ] shows their light curves .",
    "[ finderog][checks3 ] show similar stars from the ogle database on ogle  00bul12 .",
    "it is evident from these that the systematic errors in the image subtraction reduction procedure are significantly less than the statistical errors , and that the statistical errors are realistic .",
    "for the datasets that were obtained by image subtraction the fluxes in any passband were fitted to the function @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the baseline flux of the source star , and @xmath35 is the source flux on the reference image used in the image subtraction process , which in general contains some lensed flux , where @xmath36 denotes the flux from nearby unresolved stars that are not recognized by the dophot reduction procedure as being separate stars , and which are unlensed .",
    "this equation was used to incorporate the data of the mps group in the analysis of macho  98blg35 presented in  5.1 . ] .",
    "the well known amplification factor , @xmath37 , expressed in terms of the distance @xmath38 of the lens star from the line - of - sight to the source star expressed in units of @xmath19 , is given by ( paczynski 1986 ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 here @xmath17 is the minimum value of @xmath38 during an event and @xmath41 is the time of maximum amplification , i.e. the time when @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is the time scale that characterizes an event .",
    "it is equal to @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the transverse velocity of the lens with respect to the line - of - sight to the source . in fitting a single lens curve to photometry taken in one or more passbands for a given event ,",
    "there are therefore three microlensing parameters and two flux parameters for each passband .",
    "the light curves for the three events are shown in figs .",
    "[ lc98][lcogle ] together with the best single lens fits to the data . for macho  98blg35",
    "only the data obtained by the moa group have been included , since these were the only data to be reduced by image subtraction .",
    "the light curve for this event appears to exhibit substantial deviations from the single lens fit near its peak , but not at other times , suggestive of the presence of a planet ( or planets ) orbiting the lens star .",
    "other possible causes of a deviation near the peak include the source star being a binary or having starspots .",
    "the binary interpretation seems unlikely ( rhie et al 2000 ) .",
    "also it would seem that starspots are unlikely to produce perturbations of the same strength as planetary deviations except in extreme situations ( rattenbury et al 2002 , submitted to mras ) .",
    "for macho  99-lmc-2 no data were available to us at the peak , and in this case no apparent deviation from the single lens light curve is seen .",
    "for ogle  00-bul-12 there appears to be a possible deviation near the peak .",
    "the parameters and statistics of the single lens fits are displayed in table  2 .",
    "we note that the maximum magnification determined for ogle  00-bul-12 by image subtraction , @xmath46 , is considerably higher than the value of 50 first reported by the ogle early warning system .",
    "it should be noted that the first analysis was carried out using dophot and that there is a significant degree of blending present in this event .",
    "this would underestimate the fitted value for the peak magnification . on the other hand ,",
    "the light curve presented here is based on image subtraction photometry and should be unaffected by blending .",
    "we used the inverse ray shooting technique of wambsganss ( 1997 ) to simulate lensing by planetary systems of arbitrary complexity , by firing photons from the telescope through the lens system to the plane of the source star . for every component of the lens system",
    "a deflection @xmath47 was applied , where @xmath48 denotes impact parameter .",
    "photons that hit the source star were retained ; those that missed were discarded . in this way the finite size of the source star was allowed for , but the lens was treated in the thin - lens approximation .",
    "all the lens components were treated as if they were in a plane perpendicular to the ray direction .",
    "this treatment is expected to be sufficiently accurate because the dimensions of the lens system are much smaller than the distances between the lens and the observer , and the lens and the source .",
    "the general procedure that was followed for planetary modeling was to calculate the @xmath49 values of the data for a broad range of planetary models to find the model with the smallest @xmath49 .",
    "the light curve for any particular planetary model was calculated using the inverse ray shooting technique described above . unless otherwise stated , the computations for all events corresponded to the following assumed values of the lens and source star parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath8=6 kpc , @xmath9=2 kpc and @xmath51 .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath52 kpc and @xmath19 = 1.9 au .",
    "the coordinate system used for the computations is depicted in fig .",
    "[ coord ] .    for the planetary modeling , the ratio of planet - to - lens mass @xmath53 was initially allowed to vary from @xmath54 to @xmath55 in 33 approximately equally logarithmically spaced steps for each event .",
    "similarly , the projected coordinates of a planet @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the time of peak magnification were allowed to vary from @xmath58 to @xmath59 in 129 equally spaced steps .",
    "thus a total of 549,153 planetary configurations was initially trialed for each event .",
    "the trialing was done on a super - cluster computer described by rattenbury et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . for each trial ,",
    "the @xmath49 was calculated over the time interval @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to the source star traversing the diameter of the einstein ring .",
    "maps of @xmath49 over the lens plane for the 33 planetary mass fractions were examined to determine approximate positions and masses of possible planets .",
    "further minimization , described below , was subsequently carried out to determine the most likely planetary models .",
    "planetary modeling of macho  98blg35 was carried out using the combined dataset from moa , mps and planet .",
    "a typical @xmath49 map is shown in fig .",
    "[ chimap ] .",
    "this corresponds to an earth - mass planet ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the minima on these maps indicate possible positions of planets at the time of the microlensing event .",
    "maps for heavier ( lighter ) planets are similar , with the minima displaced further from ( closer to ) the einstein ring .",
    "the einstein ring is generally depicted clearly on these maps , either as a region where planets are strongly excluded , or where they may be present .",
    "the maps also depict a degeneracy that exists in the microlensing method , namely that planets at projected radii @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( expressed in units of the einstein radius ) yield similar light curves , and hence are indistinguishable in this method ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ) .    the @xmath49 map shown in fig .",
    "[ chimap ] for macho  98blg35 shows six possible positions for planets orbiting the lens star , two at position a , two at position b , and two at position c , where the doubling is caused by the degeneracy noted above .",
    "we have performed model fitting for each combination of one planet , two planet , and three planet configurations .",
    "for each model we carried out a @xmath49 minimization allowing all parameters to vary over small ranges near their initial values .",
    "the total number of free parameters was 8 for one - planet models , 11 for two - planet models , and 14 for the three - planet models .",
    "the minimization was achieved using the simplex procedure .",
    "the results are shown in table 3 .    among the single planet models ,",
    "model a gives the best improvement over the single lens with a renormalized @xmath65 .",
    "model b+c is the most favoured of the two planet models , although the @xmath49 value is not a significant improvement over model a. the improvement in @xmath49 for the triple planet model a+b+c is also not significant and as such there is no need to introduce a third planet .",
    "models a and b+c appear as the most favourable solutions for the configuration of the planetary system .",
    "while it may seem that there is no need to introduce a two planet model , we consider model b+c as an alternative because it is physically distinct from the single planet model a. the ambiguity arises here because the intensive coverage and image subtraction photometry of the event , shown in fig . 7 , did not cover the entire full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the peak .",
    "full coverage of the fwhm would reduce the ambiguities ( rattenbury et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we have drawn the light curve for model a in fig .",
    "[ planet1 ] and for model b+c in fig .",
    "[ planet2 ] together with the observational data .",
    "the data are plotted in terms of the fractional deviation from the single lens model due to the stellar component defined as @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the amplification due to a single lens given by eqns .",
    "this depends only on the three single lens parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath17 .",
    "the amplification due to the star+planet system , @xmath70 , depends upon the single lens parameters together with the positions and mass ratios of the component planets .",
    "it should be noted that the three parameters comprising the single lens component are fitted separately for each model .",
    "this affects the shape of the profile of the fractional deviation light curve .    in fig .",
    "[ caustic1 ] , we depict an additional view of model a , this time in the source plane .",
    "this shows the contour of infinite magnification for the event ( i.e. the `` caustic '' ) .",
    "it is seen that the source star does not pass between the star and the planet .",
    "hence the perturbation is negative as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ planet1 ] .",
    "it is also seen that the source star does not intersect the caustic at any time .",

    "we obtain best fit values for the planetary parameters of @xmath73 at position @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "the effect of increasing the source size serves to partially wash out the fine structure in the microlensing light curve near the peak .",

    "[ lcogle ] and table  2 show possible evidence of a deviation from the behaviour of a single lens .",
    "consequently , they were subjected to the same analysis as that accorded to macho  98blg35 . the initial search with the super - cluster computer yielded several possible planetary models , but none of these were statistically significant improvements over the single lens fit .",
    "however , one of them showed interesting behaviour , and this is reproduced below in figs .  [ mercury ] and [ caustic3 ] to illustrate the potential of the high magnification technique .    the light curve shown in fig .",
    "[ mercury ] shows the characteristic double - spiked behaviour of a caustic crossing .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ caustic3 ] which shows the source plane view of the model . here",
    "a source radius of @xmath93 has been assumed .",

    "[ mercury ] ( @xmath94 ) corresponds to a planet of mass similar to that of mercury orbiting a one - third solar mass star .",
    "the improvement over the single lens fit corresponds to @xmath95 .",
    "we note that further data were obtained during the peak of this event ( sackett 2001 ) .",
    "these could be analysed by the image subtraction technique and included in a future analysis of the event , thus reducing the uncertainties in the present analysis .",
    "given the limited coverage of this event and the low statistical significance , we do not present this as a planetary detection .",
    "however , the analysis raises interesting possibilities .",
    "the striking feature of this event is its very high peak magnification of about 160 .",
    "light curves such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ mercury ] for a mercury mass planet should apply to other events with similarly high magnifications .",
    "it can be seen that such planets can produce deviations from the single lens by about 1% .",
    "such deviations should be detectable by a network of 1-m class telescopes providing continuous and complete coverage of the peaks of high magnification events .",
    "exclusion regions for gas - giant planets orbiting the lens of ogle  00-bul-12 were also computed .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ exclude3 ] .",
    "jovian planets with projected radii @xmath900.230 au are excluded .",
    "the original proposal of griest & safizadeh ( 1998 ) to study extra - solar planets in gravitational microlensing events of high magnification has received support from the present work .",
    "it has been demonstrated that terrestrial - mass planets at orbital radii @xmath91 au may be detected with 1-m class telescopes .",
    "the essential requirement is the relentless observation of the peaks of high magnification events with coordinated telescopes encircling the globe , a relatively straightforward task .",
    "the dense stellar fields in which microlensing is necessarily observed require special photometric techniques to take account of the blending of stellar images .",
    "difference imaging analysis appears to be well suited to this task .",
    "if a concerted effort was made by the microlensing community to detect and monitor relentlessly future events of high magnification , it could reasonably be anticipated that a first approximate measurement of the abundance of terrestrial planets could be obtained in a few years .",
    "if @xmath96 high magnification events can be detected per year , a rough measurement or upper limit on the abundance of earth - mass planets orbiting @xmath900.3@xmath97 stars at projected radii @xmath901.52.5 au could be obtained in a few years ( bond et al 2002 ) . as demonstrated here",
    ", one might also obtain new information on planets as light as mercury , on extra - galactic planets , and on gas - giants .",
    "also , multi - terrestrial - planet systems should be able to be mapped in some cases ( rattenbury et al 2002 ) , rather like the multi - gas - giant systems presently being mapped by the radial velocity community ( butler et al .",
    "1999 ) . ultimately , a dedicated wide - angle space - borne telescope such as that planned for the proposed gest mission would provide excellent sensitivity towards all solar - system analogues except mercury and pluto ( bennett et al 2002 ) .",
    "it appears likely that none of the three lens objects studied here contains a jovian planet .",
    "this is consistent with previous measurements by marcy & butler ( 1998 ) and of albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of other systems .",
    "the dearth of jupiter - like planets enhances the sensitivity of microlensing studies of terrestrial planets , merely through the lack of `` background '' signals from gas - giants .",
    "for all three events further data by microlensing groups exist that could be analysed using image subtraction and incorporated in the planetary modeling .",
    "this could be expected to produce results of greater precision , and to diminish ambiguities that presently exist in the planetary modeling .",
    "the assumptions made in the present analysis on the masses , sizes and distances of the lens and source stars may be able to be avoided in the future .",
    "when the next generation space telescope comes into operation , and as the lens and source stars in today s microlensing events begin to diverge , it should be possible to measure the lens and source stellar parameters in these events by elementary photometry ( rattenbury et al 2002 ) .",
    "this being the case , the planetary modeling would be entirely free of undetermined parameters    we conclude that coordinated observations using 1-m class telescopes of gravitational microlensing events of high magnification are capable of making valuable contributions to the study of planets orbiting other stars .",
    "we are very grateful to the ogle collaboration for kindly making their images available to us .",
    "in particular we thank andrzej udalski and karol zebrun for providing images .",
    "we are also indebted to dave bennett and sun rhie for introducing us to the high magnification technique , joachim wambsganss for general discussion on microlensing , and peter dobcsanyi for introducing us to super - cluster computing .",
