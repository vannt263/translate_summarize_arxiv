    "recent advances in the development and experimental investigation of nanowire based josephson junctions @xcite attract new attention to rich physics of mesoscopic josephson effect .",
    "one of particularly interesting questions concerns the possibility to employ josephson quantum point contacts for quantum information processing .",
    "such contacts contain a small number of generic two - level systems - andreev bound levels , whose quantum states can be selectively manipulated and measured.@xcite by modulating the phase difference across the junction one is able to induce the rabi oscillation in the andreev two - level system , and therefore to prepare arbitrary superposition of the andreev states .",
    "a measurement of induced oscillation of the josephson current allows for the andreev level readout .",
    "thus the pair of andreev bound levels belonging to the same conducting mode may serve as a quantum bit.@xcite    an interesting possibility to involve a spin degree of freedom in the contact quantum dynamics , and to use it for qubit application has been investigated by chtchelkatchev and nazarov.@xcite they considered a josephson quantum point contact with spin - orbit interaction and showed how to manipulate with the spin of the andreev state .",
    "the properties of andreev bound states in spin - active mesoscopic junctions and equilibrium josephson effect have been extensively studied in recent literature;@xcite non - stationary aspects of interaction of individual magnetic scatterers with josephson current have also been discussed.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the methods of manipulation with the andreev states in josephson quantum point contacts containing a magnetic scatterer , e.g. magnetic nanoparticle situating between the superconducting electrodes.@xcite we investigate two manipulation methods : ( i ) time variation of the superconducting phase across the contact , and ( ii ) time variation of the direction of magnetic moment of the scatterer .",
    "we find that in both the cases the josephson current exhibits rabi oscillation under the resonant drive within a certain interval of biasing superconducting phase .",
    "in the case of magnetic manipulation , the effect may only exist if the andreev states are initially spin polarized , then the current oscillation is accompanied by oscillation of the andreev states spin polarization .",
    "the phase interval , where the rabi oscillation can be excited , decreases with increasing strength of the magnetic scatterer , and eventually disappears at large enough strength ; in particular in the @xmath0-junction regime , the rabi oscillation is completely forbidden .",
    "this selection rule results from specific properties of the bound andreev states in magnetic junctions as we will show .",

    "this allows for the contact description in terms of a two - component nambu spinor,@xcite similar to non - magnetic junctions , thus avoiding a double counting problem .",
    "within such an approach , the two bound andreev levels per conducting modes are only relevant , giving complete quantitative description of the stationary josephson effect as well as the resonant two - level transitions and non - stationary current response under the phase manipulation.@xcite consideration of the spin conjugated nambu spinor gives a completely equivalent physical description in terms of a reciprocal pair of andreev bound states ; both the pictures mirror each other .",
    "time variation of the direction of the magnetic moment of the scatterer leads to a violation of the spin rotation symmetry , and induces coupling between the spin conjugated nambu spinors .",
    "this results in a unitary rotation in the extended space of the four andreev bound states .",
    "it turns out , however , that this rotation splits into two equivalent rotations in invariant two - level subspaces , which mirror each other .",
    "thus the contact response can also in this case be explained in terms of the two - level rabi dynamics .",
    "for the two different ways of magnetic manipulation considered - instant switching , and small - amplitude resonant oscillation of the direction of the magnetic moment of the scatterer , the andreev two - level dynamics has a physical meaning of precession , and nutation of the spin polarization of the andreev levels , respectively .",
    "thus the spin polarization of andreev states is required in order to observe a non - trivial dynamical response.@xcite such a possibility naturally exists , as we will show , in the contact under consideration : the equilibrium andreev states exhibit strong spin polarization , up to the maximum values @xmath1 at low temperature , in certain regions of the superconducting and zeeman phases .",

    "consider , for example , the process of approaching the equilibrium state in magnetic contact after the phase bias has been suddenly changed .",
    "this will first create a non - equilibrium state in the andreev level system , both in terms of individual level populations , and total population of the level pair , which then will rapidly relax to local equilibrium via the interlevel , and level - continuum quasiparticle transitions induced by ( presumably ) strong non - magnetic interaction.@xcite such interaction does not change the total spin polarization of contact electrons , since it preserves the spin rotation symmetry , however it is able to transfer the polarization from the andreev levels to the continuum states .",
    "the total polarization is maintained in the local equilibrium by shifting the energy argument in the fermi distribution function by an energy independent constant .",
    "this constant will slowly relax to the zero value in a second relaxation stage , due to spin - flip processes .",
    "thus we conclude that decoherence of the states generated by the magnetic manipulations basically results from the same physical interactions that destroy excited states produced by the phase manipulations , and therefore one should not expect significant differences of the respective lifetimes .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the properties of andreev bound level system , and various ways of manipulation with them in josephson quantum point contacts containing magnetic scatterers .    in practice , such contacts can be realized by attaching magnetic nanoparticles or molecules to the contact bridge;@xcite another possibility is to insert magnetic macromolecules , e.g. doped metallofullerene in the contact.@xcite coulomb blockade regime in molecular dots offers additional possibility due to uncompensated spin of odd electronic configurations on the dot.@xcite    in the studied cases of resonant driving the superconducting phase difference and the direction of magnetic scatterer , the contact response consists of a time - oscillation of the josephson current , and for the magnetic drive , also oscillation of the andreev level spin polarization .",
    "we identified the regions of external parameters where these oscillations can be excited .",
    "the corresponding selection rule results from specific symmetry properties of the bound andreev states in magnetic contacts : @xmath39-periodicity of the level spectrum and strong spontaneous spin polarization .    in all the studied cases , the non - stationary contact response results from resonant dynamics of two physically identical two - level systems ( for one conducting mode ) , whose evolutions mirror each other .",
    "this is the manifestation in a non - stationary regime of the redundancy ( double counting ) of the four - component nambu description of the josephson effect in magnetic contacts . due to the fundamental constraint , eq .",
    "( [ symmetrypsi ] ) , imposed by the singlet pairing the four - component nambu field possesses the algebraic structure of majorana fermion,@xcite thus describing only two physical degrees of freedom rather than four . in contacts with magnetic impurities under discussion ,",
    "these two physical degrees of freedom relevant for the stationary josephson effect correspond to the two andreev bound states per conducting mode , similar to the case of non - magnetic contacts.@xcite    the work was supported by the swedish research council , and the ssf - oxide consortium .",
    "we are thankful to m. fogelstrm and t. lfwander for useful discussions .",
    "to explicitly construct the wave functions of the andreev states , we consider a quasiclassical approximation for @xmath196 by separating rapidly oscillating factors @xmath197 , and slowly varying envelopes @xmath198 , @xmath199 the envelopes , @xmath200 , satisfy a quasiclassical bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation,@xcite @xmath201 furthermore the superconducting phase can be eliminated from this equation and moved to the boundary condition by means of the gauge transformation , @xmath202 .",
    "the boundary condition at the contact for the quasiclassical envelopes , @xmath203 , follows from the electronic transfer matrix in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) .",
    "we assume for simplicity the short contact limit , @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the superconducting coherence length , thus neglecting the energy dispersion of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "then it is easy to establish that the transfer matrix for holes has the same form as for the electrons .",
    "thus the boundary condition connecting the left ( l ) and right ( r ) electrode wave functions can be written on the form , @xmath206 elementary solutions to a stationary bdg equation , @xmath207 , have the form for given energy @xmath208 , @xmath209 where @xmath210 index @xmath211 is defined by the zero boundary condition at the infinity .",
