    "recent findings on the superconductivity in lafeaso@xmath3f@xmath4@xcite and related materials have triggered a great deal of interest in iron compounds because of the possible connection between the superconductivity and magnetism,@xcite which undergoes a phase transition from antiferromagnetic to superconducting ground states ( and vice versa ) tuned by external pressure@xcite or chemical doping.@xcite in particular , pbo - type fese , which is one of the iron - based superconductors discovered a long time ago,@xcite has attracted attention as a key material for elucidating the superconducting mechanism , because of its extremely simple structure ( composed only of the superconducting fese@xmath5 layer ) and its excellent response to external pressure.@xcite among all similar materials , fese shows the greatest enhancement of its @xmath0 at high pressure:@xcite @xmath0 varies from 9 k ( at ambient pressure ) to 37 k ( at 6 gpa ) , indicating a growth rate as high as 4.5 k / gpa ; as a result , using fese , it is possible to demonstrate the strong correlation between the structural parameter and @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum @xmath0 value of iron pnictides is apparently attained when the fe@xmath6 ( @xmath7 : anion ) tetrahedron assumes a regular shape;@xcite however , this rule is not applicable to fese , because the fese@xmath5 tetrahedron is distorted from the regular shape,@xcite while @xmath0 increases significantly with application of pressure .",
    "although several studies have investigated fese subjected to high pressure,@xcite the pressure dependence of @xmath0 , particularly above 6 gpa , is controversial because of difficulties in measurements under high pressure conditions .",
    "for example , in one of these studies , superconductivity appeared to exist above 20 gpa , even though the phase transition from tetragonal to hexagonal ( non - superconductive ) was completed at 12.4 gpa.@xcite this discrepancy is attributable mainly to the following two reasons : the ambiguous definition of @xmath0 and the large anisotropic compressibility of the layered structure.@xcite fese does not show meissner diamagnetism at @xmath8 , which denotes the beginning of the resistivity drop ; therefore , there is no guarantee that a kink in the resistivity immediately represents to a signature of superconductivity .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 should be decided by zero resistance temperatures .",
    "moreover , the hydrostaticity of pressure is essential to obtain the precise pressure dependence of @xmath0 , because fese has an inhomogeneous compressibility,@xcite which stems from the layered structure stacked loosely by a van der waals interaction ( see upper inset of fig .",
    "1 ) . to overcome all these problems",
    ", we used a cubic - anvil - type high - pressure apparatus@xcite that ensures quasihydrostaticity by the isotropic movement of anvil tops , even after the liquid pressure - transmitting medium solidifies at low temperature and high pressure ; using this apparatus , we reconfirmed the @xmath0-@xmath9 ( pressure ) phase diagram of fese .    with this background , in this study , we measured the electrical resistivity of a high - quality fese polycrystal at pressures ranging from 0 gpa to 16 gpa and evaluated the variation in @xmath0 and the electronic state , both of which are closely related to the anion position .",
    "a precise evaluation of zero - resistivity temperature shows that the pressure dependence of @xmath0 has a slightly distorted dome - shaped curve with the maximum @xmath0 ( 30 k ) in the range of 0 @xmath10 p @xmath10 11.5 ( gpa ) and that the temperature dependence of resistivities above @xmath0 changes dramatically at around 2 gpa , suggesting the existence of different types of superconductivities at high pressure .",
    "we found a striking correlation between @xmath0 and anion ( selenium ) height , which was obtained by a direct comparison with previous report,@xcite @xmath0 varies with the anion height .",
    "moreover , this relation is broadly applicable to other ferropnictides , indicating that the high - temperature superconductivity in these materials only appears around the optimum anion height ( @xmath11.38@xmath2 ) .",
    "we suggest that the anion height should be considered as a key determining factor of @xmath0 of iron - based superconductors containing various anions .",
    "fese has a simple tetragonal structure that is composed only of edge - shared fese@xmath5 tetrahedral layers ; however , it is difficult to fabricate a good - quality superconducting fese sample , because a large amount of excess iron is absolutely imperative for the occurrence of superconductivity@xcite and extreme caution is required to prevent the formation of magnetic impurities from easily oxidizable iron .",
    "polycrystalline samples of fese used in this study were prepared by a solid - state reaction using fe ( 99.9@xmath11 , kojundo - kagaku ) and se ( 99.999@xmath11 , kojundo - kagaku ) powders .",
    "the powders were mixed in a molar ratio of 100:99 ( nominal composition of fese@xmath12 ) in an argon - filled glove box and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "then , the powders were sintered at 1343 k for 3 days , annealed at 693 k for 2 days , and finally quenched in liquid nitrogen .",
    "further details of sample preparation are described in ref .",
    "the quality of the obtained sample was verified by powder x - ray diffraction using an x - ray diffractometer with a graphite monochromator ( multiflex , rigaku ) ; the results confirmed that the sample quality was similar to that of previously reported high - quality samples.@xcite the electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility of the sample were measured using a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) magnetic property measurement system ( mpms , quantum design ) , respectively .    as shown in fig . 1 ,",
    "in our sample , zero resistivity and meissner effect were observed simultaneously at 7 k at ambient pressure . in order to evaluate the precise pressure dependence of @xmath0 , we defined both @xmath13 ( determined from the zero - resistivity temperature ) and @xmath8 ( determined from the cross point of two extrapolated lines drawn for the resistivity data around @xmath0 ) .",
    "electrical resistivity measurements were performed in the cubic - anvil - type apparatus@xcite with daphne 7474 oil@xcite as the liquid pressure - transmitting medium , which ensured precise measurements up to 16 gpa under nearly hydrostatic conditions in this study .",
    "pressure was calibrated using a calibration curve that was previously obtained by observations of several fixed - pressure points ( bi , te , sn , zns ) at room temperature .",
    "the resistivity measurements were performed by a conventional dc four - probe method , as shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "1 , with an excitation current of 1 ma . the samples used in these experiments had dimensions of 1.0@xmath140.4@xmath140.2 mm@xmath15 .",
    "( color online ) temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility ( top main panel ) and electrical resistivity ( bottom main panel ) of polycrystalline fese at ambient pressure .",
    "the top and bottom insets show the crystal structure of fese and the setting of the sample in the high - pressure apparatus ( see text for details ) , respectively . ]",
    "the left panel of fig . 2 shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivities under application of external pressures ranging from 0 gpa ( ambient pressure ) to 16 gpa . with the application of pressure ( ambient pressure to 16 gpa ) , the room - temperature resistivity decreases by a factor of more than 3 ; it reaches a minimum at 10 gpa and subsequently increases between 10 gpa and 16 gpa . in the pressure range from 0 gpa to 6 gpa ,",
    "@xmath0 ( both @xmath8 and @xmath13 ) increases rapidly but not monotonically ; further , the resistivity curves gradually change shape from the one at ambient pressure ( see top right panel of fig .",
    "meanwhile , as shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "2 , @xmath13 suddenly vanishes at 11.5 gpa ; this disappearance is attributed to a rapid enhancement of resistivities between 11 gpa and 11.5 gpa .",
    "although @xmath8 still remains above 11.5 gpa , it disappears completely at 16 gpa .",
    "figure 3 shows the pressure dependence of @xmath8 , @xmath13 , and the width of the superconducting transition , @xmath16 (= @xmath8 - @xmath13 ) .",
    "beautiful but slightly distorted dome - shaped curves are observed as cuprates@xcite and heavy fermions.@xcite however , the pressure dependence of @xmath16 shows a complicated trend . at low pressures up to 2 gpa , @xmath16 increases exponentially , indicating a salient broadening of the transition width , whereas @xmath13 increases gradually .",
    "thereafter , @xmath16 decreases moderately but increases again above 9 gpa , resulting in a dome - shaped @xmath0 curve . in the following paragraph",
    ", we shed light on the details of the abovementioned behaviors , in comparison with those reported in previous studies , to elucidate the nature of iron - based superconductors .",
    "( color online ) temperature dependence of resistivity at ambient and several other pressures ( left panel : 0@xmath116 gpa , top right panel : 0@xmath18 gpa , and bottom right panel : 9@xmath116 gpa ) for polycrystalline sample of fese . ]",
    "the most striking feature in the low - pressure region ( @xmath10 2 gpa ) is that @xmath13 has a relatively flat plateau ; that is , an increase in @xmath0 almost levels off between 1 and 1.5 gpa .",
    "a similar behavior was also observed during the measurements of dc magnetization@xcite and electrical resistivity@xcite of fese by using high - pressure piston - cylinder units ; therefore , it is probably an important characteristic of fese .",
    "a previous @xmath17se - nmr measurement@xcite showed that an antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation is significantly enhanced in the plateau region and that there exists a possibility of a magnetic phase transition or spin freezing .",
    "the superconductivity in iron - based compounds is thought to be closely related to a neighboring antiferromagnetic ordered phase ; however , tetragonal fese exhibits superconductivity without any elemental substitution ; therefore , its antiferromagnetic ground state remains undiscovered .",
    "probably , in the case of fese , the nesting of a fermi surface would improve temporarily up to @xmath12 gpa by application of external pressure , resulting in the enhancement of antiferromagnetic instabilities such as would provide constraints on the enhancement of @xmath0 .",
    "after that , the nesting condition would worsen with the application of further pressure , and `` high - temperature '' superconductivity would appear .",
    "the appearance of pressure - induced superconductivity adjacent to a magnetic - ordered phase is a characteristic feature of exotic superconductors such as cerh@xmath18si@xmath18,@xcite ceni@xmath18ge@xmath18,@xcite and cein@xmath19,@xcite with superconductivity appearing around a quantum critical point .",

    "the solid lines are obtained by connecting the data points . ]",
    "figure 4 shows an enlarged view of the resistivities around @xmath0 between 1 and 6 gpa .",
    "we can distinguish the gradual change in the shape of resistivity curves : with increasing pressure , the temperature dependence curve of resistivity changes from nearly quadratic to linear .",
    "in particular , the change between 2 gpa and 3 gpa is drastic , implying a phase transition between different superconducting states .",
    "the possibility of two kinds of superconducting phases has also been reported by sidorov @xmath20 @xmath21,@xcite indicated by the jump in @xmath22 .",
    "a linear dependence of electrical resistivities on temperature is commonly observed in cuprate superconductors@xcite and is considered to be one of the primary indicators of non - fermi - liquid behavior ; an incoherent scattering of fermion quasiparticles via magnetic interactions leads to resistivity of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are arbitrary constants , however , no linear term is expected according to conventional fermi - liquid theory .",
    "it should be noted that in our study , the non - fermi - liquid behavior was observed even in the plateau region ( because = 1.6@xmath11.2 between 1 and 2 gpa ) , indicating the development of a spin fluctuation .",
    "the temperature dependence of resistivity in the high - temperature superconducting phase ( @xmath273 gpa ) of fese is highly reminiscent of the linear temperature dependence observed in high-@xmath0 cuprates , interpreted as a `` strange metal '' phase,@xcite where it is ascribed to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "similar behaviors have also been reported for other ferropnictides , ex .",
    "ba(fe , co)@xmath18as@xmath18,@xcite implying that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and superconductivity are closely related to each other in iron - based compounds , as discussed in the context of heavy fermion and cuprate superconductors .",
    "( color online ) enlarged view of resistivity around @xmath0 between 1 and 6 gpa .",
    "the dotted lines are guides to the eye , showing the dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for simplicity",
    ", we have not shown the data at 1.5 gpa . ]    for applied pressures greater than 3 gpa , @xmath0 shows the dome - shaped curve , with maximum @xmath0 = 30.02 k at 6 gpa , whereas between 3 gpa and 9 gpa , @xmath16 continues to decline steadily .",
    "as has been noted previously , the shape of the fe@xmath6 tetrahedron is closely related to the value of @xmath0 ; in the case of iron pnictides , @xmath0 appears to attain maximum values when the as - fe - as bond angles come close to 109.47@xmath30,@xcite which corresponds to a regular tetrahedron .",
    "however , this rule is not applicable to fese.@xcite therefore , we focus on the relationship of @xmath0 with `` se height , '' which is the distance of the anion from the nearest iron layer .",
    "figure 5 shows the pressure dependence of @xmath13 and se height ( inversely scaled ) , obtained from ref .",
    "astonishingly , @xmath13 varies linearly with the se height , even in the plateau in the low - pressure region .",
    "although there is a subtle shift in the pressure dependence , which may be due to the difference in ways of applying pressures ( cubic or diamond anvil ) , there is a clear correlation between both parameters .",
    "furthermore , @xmath13 is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the se height , as can be observed from the inset of fig .",
    "4 , indicating that the smaller the se height , the more enhanced is @xmath0 .",
    "however , this seems to be contradictory to the behavior observed in other pnictides : in other pnictides , it is observed that @xmath0 is higher when the pnictogen is located at greater heights in the crystal structures;@xcite this behavior is also supported by the theoretical aspect.@xcite in any case , fese is a suitable material for demonstrating the importance of anion position as discussed below , which is inherently linked to the mechanism of superconductivity in iron - based compounds .",
    "( color online ) pressure dependence of @xmath13 and se height @xmath31 ( inversely scaled ) , as obtained from ref",
    "the inset shows @xmath13 as a function of the se height .",
    "the dotted line is a guide to the eye . ]    on application of further pressure up to 9 gpa , @xmath13 reduces monotonically to lower temperatures and disappears completely above 11.5 gpa ; then , the superconducting transition becomes less sharp , as is indicated by the broadening of the transition width @xmath16 . after the disappearance of @xmath13 , the resistivity over the entire temperature range would improve greatly with increasing pressure , indicating the occurrence of the metal - semiconductor transition . at @xmath19 gpa ,",
    "tetragonal fese starts being transformed from a tetragonal structure to a hexagonal ( nias - type ) structure , and this structure undergoes a transition from a metallic superconducting state to the semiconducting state.@xcite a recent synchrotron x - ray study on fese at various pressures@xcite has revealed that the structural transition to the hexagonal phase is completed at around 12.4 gpa , which is consistent with the fact that all traces of superconductivity ( see bottom right panel of fig .",
    "2 ) completely vanish by 16 gpa , without any trace of an anomalous decrease in resistivity .",
    "therefore , the remarkable increase in transition width @xmath16 above 9 gpa corresponds to the transition to the hexagonal phase , and this corresponds to the closure of the superconducting dome .",
    "the observed onset of @xmath0 above 11.5 gpa indicates a subtle fraction of the superconducting phase , which may no longer manifest meissner diamagnetism .",
    "( color online ) @xmath0 as a function of anion height ( @xmath32 ) for various iron ( and nickel)-based superconductors , as obtained from ref .",

    "the yellow line shows the fitting result by the lorenz function . ]",
    "we now turn to consider , in a more universal sense , the nature of the iron - based superconductivity in fese with respect to pressure tuning of @xmath0 , which is the focus area in this study .",
    "figure 6 shows the maximum @xmath0 as a function of anion height ( @xmath32 ) for various iron - based superconductors.@xcite in this study , we successfully derived the @xmath0-@xmath32 diagram of iron ( partially nickel)-based superconductors .",
    "the clear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath32 is a certain indicator of the importance of anion positions in these iron - based superconductors . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the anion height dependence of @xmath0 is well described by a lorenz curve ( yellow line ) .",
    "as the value of anion height increases , @xmath0 of the iron - based superconductors starts to increase dramatically up to @xmath155 k at a height of 1.38@xmath2 , which corresponds to the optimum value of a 1111 system .",
    "however , above the optimum anion height ( 1.38@xmath2 ) , @xmath0 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath32 , going through our measured fese region ( 1.42@xmath11.45@xmath2 ) ; finally , the value of @xmath32 becomes equal to that of non - superconducting fete ( 1.77@xmath2).@xcite it should be noted that superconductors with direct substitution in the fe@xmath6 tetrahedral layer or a large deviation from a divalent state ( fe@xmath37 ) , e.g. , an alkali metal element or co doping samples of a 122 system or chalcogen - substituted 11-system , are not particularly suitable for this trend .",
    "this is probably due to ( 1 ) the considerable disorder in the fe layers ; ( 2 ) a large gap among anion heights of different anions , for example , in fese@xmath3te@xmath4 , @xmath0 appears to be dominated only by the fe - se distance ( @xmath0 @xmath1 14 k at @xmath32 = 1.478@xmath2 , which is consistent with the lorenz curve)@xcite ; or ( 3 ) coexistence of strong magnetic fluctuation and superconductivity.@xcite we thus conclude that the appearance of `` high - temperature '' superconductivity in iron compounds is confined to a specific area that is around the optimum anion height ( 1.38@xmath2 ) , which corresponds to the radius of arsenic at ambient pressure .",
    "it has been proposed,@xcite on the basis of solutions of eliashberg equations , that the critical temperature of iron pnictides is inherently linked to their structural parameters , particularly pnictogen heights and the @xmath38-axis lattice parameter . the result obtained in this study that the pressure evolution of @xmath0 varies with the anion height , as shown in fig .",
    "5 , is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction ; however , the length of the @xmath38-axis of fese monotonically decreases with increasing pressure,@xcite which suppresses the enhancement of @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting aspect of fese , as observed from fig .",
    "6 , is that @xmath0 does not exhibit this trend above 1.43@xmath2 ( corresponding to the pressure range of 0@xmath12 gpa ) , which clearly indicates that the system attains a different electronic state below the characteristic pressure ( @xmath12 gpa ) .",
    "this could occur concomitantly with the reconstruction of a fermi surface ; the shapes of the resistivity curves above @xmath0 change clearly at around 2 gpa , as pointed out above ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which implies a significant transformation to the non - fermi - liquid state .",
    "it has been previously suggested that there is a difference in the superconducting gap symmetries of arsenic and phosphide:@xcite a full - gap strong coupling @xmath39-wave for high-@xmath0 arsenide compounds and nodal low-@xmath0 for phosphide compounds , which is widely perceived in many studies .",
    "a theoretical approach@xcite has suggested that the pairing symmetry of iron pnictides is determined by the pnictogen heights between a high-@xmath0 nodeless gap for high @xmath32 or a low-@xmath0 nodal gap for low @xmath32 , corresponding to the left - hand side of the lorenz curve shown in fig .",
    "although fese is located on the right - hand side , i.e. , in a region of extremely high @xmath32 , it is highly probable that fese shows two or more different types of superconductivities under application of external pressures , as is the case with pnictides .",
    "the extremely soft crystal structure of fese enables the control of @xmath32 in a wide range and the superconducting mechanism can be switched by the application of modest pressure .",
    "it may be interesting to explore the gap symmetry of fese at high pressure ( @xmath16 gpa ) by nmr or muon spin rotation and whether there is any difference between the gap symmetry of fese and those of other iron - based superconductors .",
    "in this study , the precise pressure dependence of the electric resistivity of fese was measured in the pressure range of 0 - 16.0 gpa at temperatures of 4 - 300 k by using a cubic - anvil - type high - pressure apparatus . @xmath0",
    "estimated from zero - resistivity temperature shows a slightly distorted dome - shaped curve , with the maximum @xmath0 = 30 k in the range of 0 @xmath40 11.5 ( gpa ) , which is lower than those in previous studies .",
    "the temperature dependence of resistivity above @xmath0 changes dramatically at around 2@xmath13 gpa ; the shapes of the resistivity curves change to linear shapes , which is one of the primary indicators of non - fermi - liquid behavior ; this behavior strongly suggests a phase transition between different superconducting states .",
    "a striking correlation is found between @xmath0 and anion ( selenium ) height : the lower the se height , the more improved is @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , this relation is broadly applicable to other iron pnictides , indicating that the high - temperature superconductivity in these materials appears only around the optimum anion height ( @xmath11.38@xmath2 ) .",
    "on the basis of these results , we suggest that anion height should be considered as a key determining factor of @xmath0 in iron - based superconductors containing various anions .",

    "<S> in this study , we performed high - pressure electrical resistivity measurements of polycrystalline fese in the pressure range of 1 - 16.0 gpa at temperatures of 4 - 300 k. a precise evaluation of @xmath0 from zero - resistivity temperatures revealed that @xmath0 shows a slightly distorted dome - shaped curve , with maximum @xmath0 ( 30 k ) at 6 gpa , which is lower than a previously reported @xmath0 value ( @xmath137 k ) . with the application of pressure , the temperature dependence of resistivity above @xmath0 changes dramatically to a linear dependence ; </S>",
    "<S> a non - fermi - liquid - like `` high-@xmath0 '' phase appears above 3 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> we found a striking correlation between @xmath0 and the se height : the lower the se height , the more enhanced is @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this relation is broadly applicable to other iron pnictides , strongly indicating that high - temperature superconductivity can appear only around the optimum anion height ( @xmath11.38@xmath2 ) . on the basis of these results </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the anion height should be considered as a key determining factor of @xmath0 of iron - based superconductors containing various anions . </S>"
