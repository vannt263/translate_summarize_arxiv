    "the evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) carries key information for understanding the growth history of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galactic centers .",

    "recently , the space density of lower luminosity agns has been also investigated from deep optical survey fields @xcite , although the results are still controversial due to the complexity of the corrections required for incompleteness and contamination . while these optical surveys are useful in detecting unobscured ( so - called type-1 ) agns",
    ", they inevitably miss the population of obscured ( type-2 ) agns , the major class of the agn population ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hard x - ray observations at rest - frame energies above a few kev provide an ideal opportunity to detect obscured agns , thanks to their much smaller biases against absorption than the optical band and low contamination from stars in the host galaxies .",
    "@xcite reports that the space density of x - ray - selected luminous agns significantly declines at @xmath1 , similar to that of optically - selected qsos , although they have to assume a completeness correction because the spectroscopic identification rate of the sample is not high ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "a decline of the space density above @xmath19 is confirmed for luminous agns with intrinsic 210 kev luminosities of @xmath20 erg s@xmath3 . while the functional shape of this decline is found to be consistent with that of the exponential decline parameterization proposed by @xcite , which is based on the optically - selected qsos",
    ", it still has a large uncertainty due to the limited sample size . for quantitative comparison with the results obtained in other wavelengths and theoretical models , it is important to establish the shape of the decline from a larger x - ray - selected agn sample with high completeness .",
    "another key observational property of agns is the type-2 agn fraction ( or more precisely , the distribution of absorption column density ) , which gives strong constraints on the environments around smbhs including the obscuring tori and host galaxies . according to the unified model of agns @xcite",
    ", the classification of agns depends only on the viewing angle between the observer and the rotation axis of the torus .",

    "further details of the photometric redshift determination are discussed in akiyama et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the photometric redshifts is examined by comparing them with the spectroscopic ones .",
    "the median of @xmath51 is 0.06 for the entire sample .",
    "we further examine the accuracy by the normalized median absolute deviation ( nmad ; @xmath52 ) following @xcite .",

    "the @xmath52 for type-1 agns ( 0.201 ) is larger than that for type-2 agns ( 0.095 ) .",
    "this is because there is no strong feature in the seds of the type-1 agns except for the break below ly@xmath42 . however , since the break can be covered by the deep optical images for agns at @xmath1 , the discrepancy between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is smaller for agns at @xmath1 . regarding the completeness and contamination for the @xmath1 agn sample ,",
    "one agn at @xmath55 shows @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , five agns at @xmath55 have @xmath56 .",
    "it needs to be emphasized that in order to determine photometric redshifts of @xmath1 agns reliably , deep optical imaging data are crucial since they can detect sharp decline of flux below the wavelength of rest - frame ly@xmath42 emission .",
    "finally , most of the x - ray sources are identified as agns at well estimated redshifts with a very high degree of completeness ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "photometric redshifts can not be determined for six objects that are detected in less than 4 bands .",
    "we discuss their possible contributions in sections  [ sec : pz ] and [ subsec : space density ] .",
    "dropout method is a simple selection criterion for galaxies and agns at high redshifts , and sometimes such selection is preferred than the selection with the photometric redshifts , because the photometric redshifts can be affected by a catastrophic failure @xcite . in order to compare the dropout selection with the photometric redshift selection , we plot @xmath58 and @xmath43 color - color diagram for agns at @xmath1 ( left ) and @xmath59 ( right ) in figure  [ fig : sxds_bdr ] .",
    "the @xmath1 agns show red @xmath43 color , which is consistent with the break below ly@xmath42 emission .",
    "the red color can be a crude check of the photometric redshifts , which are determined by the seds with all 15 bands .",
    "most of the @xmath1 type-1 agns have blue @xmath58 color as well , and they are enclosed within the criterion ( dotted lines ) that is determined to exclude most of the @xmath59 agns ( three @xmath59 type-2 agns that are enclosed within the criterion have photometric redshifts of 2.62.8 , close to @xmath15 ) . in contrast , @xmath1 type-2 agns have redder @xmath58 color than type-1 agns on average , and some of them have similar colors to agns at lower redshifts .",
    "thus , selection based on the optical colors only is useful in general but may miss a part of type-2 agns that have red uv color above ly@xmath42 emission .      for our study , we select a high - redshift agn sample at @xmath1 detected in the 0.52 kev band , on the basis of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts determined by akiyama et al .",
    "thanks to the k - correction effect , even absorbed agns can be observed in the 0.52 kev band ( corresponding to the rest - frame energies above 28 kev for @xmath1 ) , where the maximum sensitivity of _ xmm - newton _ is achieved .",
    "our final @xmath1 agn sample consists of 30 objects , among which 20 and 10 agns have spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , respectively .",
    "the properties of the sample are summarized in table  [ tab : sample ] and the optical spectra of the spectroscopic sample are displayed in figure  [ fig : optical - spec ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : redshift_dist ] exhibits the distribution of redshift for the @xmath1 agn sample .",
    "possible effects related to the uncertainties in the photometric redshifts are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "since the photometric redshifts are determined only by broad - band photometries , they could have uncertainties unlike spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdfs ] illustrates examples of the normalized probability distribution functions ( pdfs , p(@xmath46 ) ) for the photometric redshift for two sources without spectroscopic redshifts , sxdf0154 and sxdf0321 , calculated from the distribution of the @xmath47 value obtained in the sed fitting .",
    "sxdf0154 has a primary solution ( i.e. , the highest peak of pdf ) at @xmath1 , and hence is included in our @xmath1 agn sample .",
    "by contrast , sxdf0321 is not included in the sample since the pdf has its peak at @xmath59 . both of them , however , have finite probabilities at @xmath59 and @xmath1 .",
    "to take into account the shape of the pdf in each object statistically , we consider the contribution from all 0.52 kev selected agns in the akiyama et al .",
    "( 2012 ) catalog to the @xmath1 agn sample , using the normalized pdfs between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "for the sources with spectroscopic redshifts , we define their pdfs as delta - functions peaked at their measured redshifts .",
    "it is found that the `` effective '' number of objects in the @xmath1 agn sample , computed by summing the fraction of the normalized pdfs in the @xmath46 = 35 region ( @xmath62 ) from all objects , is 30.6 , when the six unidentified objects are ignored .",
    "this value is almost the same as the number of the best - fit @xmath1 agn sample described in the previous subsection . even if we include the unidentified objects for the calculation , the effective number is computed to be 33.7 , which is still within the 1@xmath36 error of the number of our @xmath1 agn sample .",
    "we also confirm that there are no significant changes in the luminosity and absorption column density distributions of the sample when we consider the pdfs of photometric redshifts ; here the contribution of each object to the distributions is added with a weight of @xmath63 over the redshift range of @xmath46 = 35 .",
    "hence , we hereafter consider only the best - fit values of the photometric redshifts .",
    "for our discussion of the obscured agn fraction , we need to classify each object in our sample as a type-1 or type-2 agn .",
    "there are two different ways to classify agn : one is based on the optical spectra ( optical type ) and the other is based on the absorption column densities , @xmath64 , in the x - ray spectra ( x - ray type ) .",
    "the optical type is basically determined by the presence of broad , permitted emission lines .",
    "considering the distribution of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the broad - line agns in the local universe",
    "@xcite , we classify our spectroscopic sample : those showing significant broad lines with velocity widths larger than 1,000 km s@xmath3 are optical type-1 and the others are optical type-2 . in the @xmath1 sample ,",
    "all but one ( sxdf0809 ) broad - line agns have the fwhm of the broad - line width larger than 2,000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , their optical classifications are not changed even if we use the threshold of 2,000 km s@xmath3 instead of 1,000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the civ line of sxdf0809 has the fwhm of 1,470 km s@xmath3 .",
    "although it is classified as a type-1 agn since the civ line shows broader wing , it needs to be noted that it also shows a strong heii line , which is typical for narrow - line agns .",
    "the contribution from the narrow - line component is large in this object .    for the 10 agns without spectroscopic redshifts ( i.e. , those that do not show any significant line features or do not have optical / near - infrared spectra available ) , we classify them by the type of a template spectrum ( i.e. , qso or galaxy ) . for spectroscopically - identified agns",
    ", there is a good correlation between the spectral type and the best - fit sed type : type-1 ( type-2 ) agns are well fitted with qso ( galaxy ) templates .",
    "specifically , among the twenty @xmath1 agns with spectroscopic identification , the spectroscopic and photometric types match well for 15 objects .",
    "we therefore classify spectroscopically - unidentified objects fitted better with qso ( galaxy ) template into type-1 ( type-2 ) agns . considering the mismatch rate of 25%",
    ", we estimate that less than two (= 9 * 0.25 - 1 * 0.25 ) out of the nine agns with galaxy spectra could be truly type-1 agns ; this uncertainty will be taken into account in the discussion on optical type-2 agn fraction ( section  [ sec : opt_f_type2 ] ) .",
    "we do not consider combined templates with galaxy and agn in the photometric redshift determination .",
    "it will not affect the classification of the @xmath1 agns , since at @xmath1 the sxds sample covers only luminous agns and the seds of luminous type-1 agns are completely dominated by qso components .",
    "a general problem of relying on the optical type is that the classification may depend on the quality of the available optical spectra , since good signal - to - noise ratio is required to detect less - luminous broad - emission lines on top of stellar continuum emission of host galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , such effects are not expected to be significant in our sample since it consists of luminous agns for which contamination from the host galaxies is negligible .",
    "x - ray absorption is an alternative good indicator of agn type , as expected from the unified scheme @xcite : type-2 agns are viewed through the dust torus , and hence have higher absorption column densities than type-1 agns . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt @xmath65 @xmath7 as the dividing criterion : agns with log @xmath66 and @xmath67 are classified as x - ray type-1 and type-2 , respectively .",
    "this criterion is adopted by many authors , and is known to be generally in good agreement with the optical type ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the merit of using x - ray classification is that observational biases in x - ray surveys can be well defined and can be corrected in a straightforward way .",
    "thus , we basically adopt the x - ray type for our study , although consistency with results based on the optical type is also discussed .",
    "to derive the absorption column density ( @xmath64 ) for each agn , we use an x - ray hardness ratio ( hr ) between two energy bands , since it is difficult to perform spectral fitting due to the limited photon statistics for most of the x - ray sources in our sample .",
    "we define the hr value as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the vignetting - corrected count rates in the 0.31.0 kev and 1.04.5 kev bands , respectively .",
    "we find that this choice of bands gives the best sensitivity for the determination of the @xmath64 value for @xmath71 @xmath7 , for objects at @xmath46 = 35 .",
    "since these count rates are not available in the @xcite catalog , we re - analyzed the _ xmm - newton _ images in these two bands at the fixed source positions , utilizing exactly the same datasets and analysis software as used in @xcite .",
    "the relationship between hr and redshift of our agn sample is shown in figure  [ fig : hr4-z_opttype ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr4-lognh_relation ] shows the relationship between hr and column density at @xmath46 = 3 , 4 , and 5 . here and after , we assume a power law with a photon index of 1.9 plus a reflection component from cold matter with a solid angle of @xmath72 as the intrinsic spectrum , following @xcite .",
    "we derive the column densities of our agn sample from the redshift and observed hr value using this relation , and then calculate their intrinsic ( de - absorbed and rest - frame 210 kev ) fluxes and luminosities",
    ". where an observed hr corresponds to log @xmath73 , we set it to log @xmath74 .",

    "the survey is incomplete for sources with log @xmath75 in the lowest luminosity range below log @xmath76 at @xmath77 .",
    "however , we confirm that this does not affect our estimate on the space density of all compton - thin agns with log @xmath78 over the statistical errors as far as the fraction of heavily obscured agns with @xmath79 is not extremely high .",
    "we find that all of our agn sample have intrinsic luminosities of log @xmath80 erg s@xmath3 , and hence belong to the qso class . while the x - ray agn types match the optical ones for 18 out of 30 agns in our sample , they do not for the others .",
    "this is largely due to the statistical error of column density .",
    "we can , however , correct for it by considering a conversion matrix from an intrinsic to observed @xmath64 distributions ( see section  [ subsub : method2 ] ) .",
    "to investigate the cosmological evolution of agns at @xmath11 , we calculate the comoving space density from our sample utilizing the @xmath4 method @xcite .",

    "this result is consistent with the conclusion by @xcite that the type-2 agn fraction increases with @xmath46 but saturates beyond @xmath109 or @xmath110 .      to investigate the cosmological evolution of the fraction of type-2 agns ( @xmath111 ) in the whole compton - thin population ( i.e. , with @xmath112 @xmath7 ) from @xmath10 to @xmath113 , we constrain @xmath111 at @xmath46 = 35 in the intrinsic luminosity range of log @xmath85 = 4445 using our sxds sample .",

( 2 ) due to the limited number of photons detected , there is a statistical fluctuation of the best - fit column density derived from the observed hardness ratio ( i.e. , an agn can apparently have a different absorption column density from the true value ) .",
    "it must be noted that the observed column densities are not simply subject to gaussian or poissonian errors but have complex probability distributions with unsymmetric negative and positive errors .",
    "this could make the `` observed '' distribution simply based on the best - fit column density of each object quite different from the `` intrinsic '' one .    to obtain the true absorption distribution by taking into account these two biases simultaneously",
    ", we consider a `` conversion matrix '' from the intrinsic @xmath64 distribution into the observed one , similar to that used by @xcite . here",
    "we consider the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) , the co - moving number density per unit co - moving volume per log @xmath85 interval as a function of @xmath85 and @xmath46 , to predict the expected number of agns with a given range of @xmath64 from the sxds survey , using the area curve given as a function of count rate @xcite .",
    "then , by simulating the statistical fluctuation in the observed count rates ( and hence hardness ratios ) according to the real survey characteristics , we reproduce the expected distribution of the best - fit @xmath64 from each input @xmath64 value .",
    "finally , we perform a fit to the observed histogram of @xmath64 with the model prediction calculated via the matrix , by changing the type-2 fraction as a free parameter . with this procedure",
    ", we can most reliably constrain the `` intrinsic '' absorption distribution in a _ statistical _ sense , even if it is hard to determine @xmath64 of an individual object .    for the shape of the 210 kev xlf",
    ", we adopt the luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model of @xcite by further introducing a power - law decline of the comoving space density at high redshifts as reported in subsection  [ subsec : space density ] .",
    "thus , the evolution factor in equation  ( 16 ) of @xcite is replaced by the form : @xmath114 \\\\      \\displaystyle ( 1 + z_{c})^{p1 } \\left(\\frac{\\displaystyle 1 + z}{\\displaystyle 1 + z_{c}}\\right)^{p2 } & [ z_{c}(l_{\\rm x } ) \\le z < z_{c2 } ] \\\\      \\displaystyle ( 1 + z_{c})^{p1 } \\left(\\frac{\\displaystyle 1 + z_{c2}}{\\displaystyle 1 + z_{c}}\\right)^{p2 } \\left(\\frac{\\displaystyle 1 + z}{\\displaystyle 1 + z_{c2}}\\right)^{p3 } & [ z \\ge z_{c2 } ] , \\\\    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are adopted , following @xcite . here",
    "the cutoff redshift , beyond which the comoving space density of agns decreases , is set to @xmath98 , following @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath118 for the power - law slope at @xmath119 based on our result from both the sxds and cosmos samples .",
    "we also use the `` @xmath64 function '' introduced by @xcite , @xmath120 , i.e. the normalized probability distribution function for the absorption column density . in our calculation , @xmath120 is assumed to be independent of luminosity and redshift for simplicity .",
    "we confirm that the effect caused by the luminosity dependence of the type-2 fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on our result is smaller than the statistical uncertainty , because the luminosity range of our sample is narrow ( log @xmath85 = 4445 ) .",
    "the expected number of agns detected , @xmath121 , in the intrinsic luminosity range log @xmath85 = 4445 , @xmath46 = 35 , and intrinsic column density range @xmath64 = @xmath122@xmath123 is computed as @xmath124 the @xmath121 values , calculated by assuming a flat @xmath64 function , give the relative detection efficiency for agns with different column densities .",
    "figure  [ fig : detection - efficiency ] shows the result , normalized to unity at log @xmath64 = 20.020.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : conversion_matrix ] illustrates the conversion matrix from the intrinsic to observed @xmath64 distributions , calculated for a flat @xmath120 in the range of log @xmath64 = 2024 .",
    "each panel of figure  [ fig : conversion_matrix ] represents the expected @xmath64 distribution for agns with input intrinsic column densities of log @xmath64 = 2021 , log @xmath64 = 2122 , log @xmath64 = 2223 , and log @xmath64 = 2324 . here",
    ", it is again emphasized that the statistical errors in the count rates ( eventually , those in the best - fit @xmath64 values ) are taken into account , based on the observed correlation between the count rate and its error , from the re - analysis described in section  [ sec : absorption column density ] .",
    "it is seen from figure  [ fig : conversion_matrix ] that the total number of detected agns decreases with the input @xmath64 and the observed @xmath64 distribution has a wide dispersion with respect to the input @xmath64 value due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "using this matrix , we perform a poisson maximum likelihood fitting to the observed @xmath64 histogram of our agn sample .",
    "we assume a flat shape for the @xmath64 function in two @xmath64  regions , log @xmath64  = 2022 and log @xmath64  = 2224 , with the type-2 agn fraction as a free parameter to be determined through the fitting .",
    "the shape of the xlf is fixed to the model described above , while its normalization is tuned to reproduce the total number of observed agns at @xmath46 = 35 for our best - fit @xmath64  function .",
    "it is confirmed , however , that the choice of the xlf model does not affect our conclusion , by introducing the luminosity and density evolution ( lade ) model @xcite instead of the ldde model .",
    "we finally obtain a x - ray type-2 agn fraction of 0.54@xmath8 from our sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitting_result-4bin_norm - fix ] shows the observed histogram of @xmath64 with 1@xmath36 poisson errors ( black squares ) , on which the model prediction from the @xmath64  function with the best - fit type-2 agn fraction is overplotted ( red solid line ) .      to confirm the result obtained in the previous subsection , here we also estimate the type-2 agn fraction based on the optical type of each agn , not by referring to the x - ray absorption . in our sample",
    ", we have a total of 17 optical type-1 and 13 optical type-2 agns .",
    "to derive the intrinsic optical type-2 agn fraction , we have to assume a relationship between optical type and absorption column density , since the latter determines the observational biases in an x - ray survey .",
    "here , we simply assume that our optical type-1 and type-2 agns correspond to those with log @xmath64  @xmath125 and log @xmath64  = 2224 , respectively , following @xcite .",
    "then , we can utilize the detection efficiency plotted in figure  [ fig : detection - efficiency ] to correct for the detection bias .",
    "since the optical properties are independent of the x - ray spectral information , we do not need to consider the statistical error in @xmath64  in contrast with the previous case . in this way",
    ", the optical type-2 fraction for agns with log @xmath85 = 4445 erg s@xmath3 at @xmath46 = 35 is estimated to be @xmath111 = 0.59@xmath90.09 .",
    "even when we consider the possible uncertainties in the classification of the 10 photometric redshift sample ( section  [ sec : classification of agns ] ) , the type-2 agn fraction can be at least 0.52@xmath90.09 .",
    "these values are consistent with the x - ray result . the statistical error becomes smaller than that for the x - ray type-2 fraction because there is no coupling between the two types caused by the statistical fluctuation in the @xmath64 value .",
    "we must note , however , that the correspondence of the optical type to x - ray absorption may have some ambiguities that could produce additional systematic uncertainties .      by fully taking into account the observational biases , including the photon statistics of the x - ray survey data , we have derived the x - ray type-2 agn ( log @xmath64  @xmath26 22 ) fraction in the compton - thin population to be 0.54@xmath8 at @xmath46 = 35 and in the luminosity range of log @xmath85 = 4445 .",
    "the consistency with the optical type-2 fraction of 0.59@xmath90.09 , which is independently measured , supports the robustness of our result .",
    "recently , @xcite roughly estimate the type-2 agn fraction with log @xmath126 at @xmath12735 to be @xmath12875% , by comparing the normalizations of x - ray ( type-1 + type-2 ) and uv ( type-1 only ) luminosity functions derived from the cosmos data .",
    "their estimate is somewhat larger than our result , although it should be very sensitive to the adopted @xmath129 value used for the luminosity conversion .",
    "we can now compare our x - ray type-2 agn fraction with that obtained at lower redshifts to investigate its cosmological evolution .",
    "recently , @xcite have compiled an agn sample in the local universe detected in the 3-year swift / bat survey performed in the 1555 kev band , where no detection bias is expected for compton - thin agns ( log @xmath64  @xmath130 ) .",
    "we find the x - ray type-2 fraction in their sample to be @xmath131 in the luminosity range as corresponding to log @xmath85 = 4445 in the 210 kev band , converted assuming a photon index of 2 .",
    "our result at @xmath132 is significantly higher than the local value , at a @xmath13390% confidence level based on a @xmath47 test , by a factor of @xmath134 ( the error is @xmath25 ) .",
    "when we instead adopt the optical classification for the sxds sample , the factor becomes @xmath135 and the confidence level corresponds to @xmath136% .",
    "thus , we establish the evolution of type-2 fraction from @xmath60 to @xmath1 in the high - luminosity range , where it has not been well constrained so far .",
    "we confirm that our results are consistent with the formulation of @xcite for the type-2 fraction given as a function of luminosity and redshift .",
    "he finds that the type-2 fraction normalized at log @xmath85  = 43.75 ( to correct for the luminosity dependence ) increases as @xmath137 and then saturates above @xmath138 .",
    "the formula given in @xcite gives @xmath139 by substituting log @xmath85 = 44.6 as the averaged luminosity in our sample , the type-2 fraction is calculated to be 0.49@xmath90.13 at @xmath46 = 3.25.2 .",
    "note that hasinger s",
    "`` type-2 '' definition utilizes both optical and x - ray information , which is not exactly the same as ours ; in fact , he argues that the criterion roughly corresponds to log @xmath64  = 21.5 , instead of 22 , and therefore we have to reduce @xmath111 to match our definition of x - ray type-2 fraction .",
    "if we assume a flat @xmath64  function above log @xmath64  = 21.5 , the value of type-2 agn fraction in his definition is reduced by 20% in our definition ; specifically , @xmath140 in his definition corresponds to an x - ray type-2 fraction of 0.39@xmath90.10 in ours .",
    "thus , the formula of @xcite is in agreement with the x - ray type-2 fraction derived from our sxds sample within the errors , although our results may favor a slightly higher type-2 fraction at @xmath1 .",
    "thanks to the deep and wide area coverage of the sxds survey with extensive multi - wavelength follow - up observations , we are able to construct a highly complete x - ray - selected agn sample at high redshifts ( @xmath141 ) , consisting of 20 and 10 agns with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , respectively .",
    "the conclusions are summarized as follows :    * we derive the comoving space density of compton - thin agns at @xmath46 = 35 with intrinsic luminosities of @xmath85 = 10@xmath142 erg s@xmath3 at @xmath1 , using the @xmath4 method .",
    "we confirm the trend that the space density significantly declines with redshift as reported in previous works .",
    "combining our sxds result with that from the cosmos survey @xcite , we find that the comoving space density decreases as @xmath143 or @xmath144 , providing so - far the best constraint on the declining profile of x - ray - selected agns at @xmath1 . * by carefully taking into account observational biases , including statistical uncertainties in the absorption column densities derived from the x - ray data , we derive the obscured agn fraction with @xmath145 @xmath7 among those with @xmath146 @xmath7 to be 0.54@xmath8 at @xmath46 = 35 in the luminosity range of @xmath85 = 10@xmath142 erg s@xmath3 . from comparison with the results obtained at lower redshifts , we establish that there is a significant redshift evolution of obscured fraction from @xmath60 to @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath134 in the high - luminosity range .",

    "<S> this result is consistent with an independent determination of the type-2 agn fraction based on optical properties , for which the fraction is found to be 0.59@xmath90.09 . comparing our result with that obtained in the local universe , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the obscured fraction of luminous agns increases significantly from @xmath10 to @xmath11 by a factor of 2.5@xmath91.1 . </S>"
