    "blazars are the most commonly detected extragalactic vhe @xmath1-ray sources , with steadily increasing numbers in the very high energy regime ( vhe , e@xmath8@xmath9gev ) in the past 15 years of ground - based @xmath1-ray astronomy .",
    "these objects are a subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with a set of characteristic properties like strong continuum emission extending from the radio all the way to the @xmath1-ray regime , high polarization ( at both optical and radio frequencies ) and rapid variability at all frequencies and on all time scales probed so far .",
    "blazars are thought to be agns with jets which are closely aligned with our line - of - sight .",
    "this type of agn subclass emits a characteristic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with at least two broad emission components : one peak with a maximum in optical to x - ray band and a second peak located in the @xmath1-ray bands @xcite .",
    "the first peak is commonly thought to be related to the synchrotron emission process in magnetic fields of the jets and the second peak is explained as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of low energy photons @xcite .",
    "if the low energy photons which undergo the ic process are the synchrotron photons , the process is known as the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the origin of the low energy photons can be external to the jet due to external compton scattering ( ec ; @xcite ) .",
    "1es0033 + 595 is a blazar near the galactic plane at cordinates ( j2000 ) r.a.:00:35:52.63 and dec:59:50:04.56 @xcite , belonging to the bl lac type .",
    "it is classified as an extreme high - frequency peaked ( hbl ) object with synchrotron emission peaking near @xmath10hz @xcite .",
    "so far , optical observations of 1es0033 + 595 were not able to resolve the host galaxy to determine a photometric redshift and thus the redshift of the blazar remains uncertain .",
    "a tentative redshift of 0.086 was derived by perlman , and mentioned in falomo & kotilainen ( 1999 ) as a private communication , however to the best of our knowledge the details are not yet published . from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) images the only information that could be derived was the brightness of the nucleus and an upper limit to the brightness of the surrounding nebulosity , from which a lower limit of @xmath11 has been derived by sbarufatti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    1es0033 + 595",
    "was first detected as a hard x - ray source by the einstein slew survey in 1992 @xcite . in 1996",
    "it was observed by the hst as part of the snapshot survey of bl lac objects , and was resolved into two point - like sources with a separation of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these two objects with nearly identical brightness were explained as multiple images of a gravitationally lensed system .",
    "however , the vla astrometric observations performed in 1997 did not detect a second radio source , ruling out that possibility @xcite .",
    "1es0033 + 595 was observed by the x - ray satellite bepposax in december 1999 .",
    "due to high galactic absorption it could only be detected in the lecs instrument above @xmath13kev and in the pds instrument up to @xmath14 @xmath15kev @xcite .",
    "the source was also detected with the _ integral _ satellite in 2003 in the @xmath16  ",
    "@xmath17kev energy band with a statistical significance of @xmath18 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , during integral observations in 2005 @xcite the source was a factor of 2.4 brighter .",
    "the fact that all three x - ray observations show different flux levels emphasize very well the variable x - ray nature of this bl lac object . with its large field of view and nearly continuous sky coverage the burst alert telescope ( bat ) instrument on - board",
    "the _ swift _ satellite also detected 1es0033 + 595 during the first 22 months ( 2004 dec - 2006 oct ) of observation @xcite , and has been included in the 22 , 58 , and 70-month bat catalogs .",
    "in the he @xmath1-ray range the source has been continously detected by the _ fermi _",
    "large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "the source was reported for the first time after the first 5.5 months of sky survey observations @xcite . since then it has been part of the _ fermi _ first bright agn catalog , with a spectrum consistent with a flat power law with @xmath19 = 2.00 @xmath20 0.13 and a flux of f(@xmath21mev ) = ( 20.3 @xmath20 5.1)@xmath22 @xcite . in the vhe @xmath1-ray band",
    "this source was first observed for @xmath23h in december 1995 by the whipple observatory .",
    "these observations yielded only upper limits , f(@xmath24gev ) @xmath25 @xmath26 , equivalent to 20% of the crab nebula flux @xcite .",
    "magic observations of this source were motivated by the bepposax observations @xcite .",
    "therein 1es0033 + 595 was one of the most promising candidate tev emitters .",
    "magic observed this object in 2006 and later in 2008 for about @xmath27h . from these observations ,",
    "only a flux upper limit at 95% confidence level was obtained : f(@xmath28  gev ) @xmath29 , 9.7% of the crab nebula flux @xcite .",
    "new observations in 2009 during the commissioning phase of the magic stereoscopic system led to the discovery of the source in the vhe-@xmath1-ray range @xcite , as described in this paper .",

    "magic is a system of two @xmath30m - dish imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) located at the roque de los muchachos observatory ( @xmath31n , @xmath32w , @xmath33  m a.s.l . ) , in the canary island of la palma . since 2009",
    "the magic telescopes have carried out stereoscopic observations with a sensitivity of @xmath34 of the crab nebula flux , for energies above @xmath35gev in @xmath17h of observations  @xcite .",

    "these observations were performed during the commissioning phase of the magic stereoscopic system . during this time",
    ", the data taking was carried out using the so - called `` soft stereo trigger mode '' , i.e. using the magic - i trigger system and operating magic - ii in `` slave mode '' .",
    "compared to the standard trigger mode adopted for regular stereoscopic observations ( the so - called `` full stereo trigger mode '' , where the cherenkov events are triggered simultaneously by both telescopes ) , the `` soft stereo trigger mode '' has slightly less sensitivity at the energies below @xmath37  gev . in order to take the non - standard trigger condition into account ,",
    "dedicated monte carlo ( mc ) @xmath1-ray simulations were generated and adopted in this analysis .",
    "the observations of 1es0033 + 595 were carried out in the so - called wobble mode  @xcite , in which the pointing direction alternates every @xmath16  min between two positions , offset by @xmath38 in r.a . from the source .",
    "the data were taken at zenith angles ranging between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which resulted in an analysis energy threshold ( defined as the peak of the mc @xmath1-ray simulated energy distribution for an energy distribution of photon index 3.8 after all analysis cuts ) of @xmath41gev .",
    "after the application of standard quality checks based on the rate of the stereo events and the distributions of basic image parameters , @xmath42h of effective on - time events were selected to derive the results .",
    "the rejected data were affected mainly by non - optimal atmospheric conditions during the data taking .",
    "the data analysis was performed using the standard software package mars  @xcite , including the latest standard routines for the stereoscopic analysis  @xcite . after the calibration  @xcite and the image cleaning of the events , the information from the individual telescopes is combined and the calculation of basic stereo image parameters is performed . for the @xmath1/hadron separation and @xmath1-direction estimation a multivariate method called random forest (",
    "rf ,  @xcite ) is applied . for the former task ,",
    "the algorithm employs basic image parameters  @xcite , timing information  @xcite , and stereo parameters  @xcite to compute a @xmath1/hadron discriminator called _ hadronness _ by comparison of real ( hadron - dominated ) data with mc @xmath1-ray simulations .",
    "the _ hadronness _",
    "parameter ranges from 0 ( for showers confidently identified as initiated by @xmath1-rays ) to 1 ( for those clearly showing the features of a hadronic cosmic - ray initiated shower ) .",
    "finally , the estimation of the energy of the events is achieved by averaging individual energy estimators for both telescopes based on look - up tables  @xcite .",
    "the final analysis cuts applied to the 1es0033 + 595 data were optimized by means of contemporaneous crab nebula data and mc simulations . in computing the significance of the signal coming from the 1es0033 + 595 sky region , single cuts in _ hadronness _ and @xmath43 ( see section  [ sec : magicresults ] ) optimized for energies close to the threshold were applied - rays of @xmath44 . ] .",
    "conversely , while deriving the spectrum and the light curve of the source , multiple cuts optimized in logarithmic energy bins were considered .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat ( large area telescope ) is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from @xmath16  mev to more than @xmath5  gev .",
    "normally it operates in all - sky survey mode , scanning the entire sky every 3h .",
    "therefore it can provide observations of 1es 0033 + 595 simultaneous with magic .",
    "_ fermi _ data presented in this paper were collected from 2009 august 17 to october 14 . in addition , to make a comparison with the behavior of the source over a wider time interval , we also show the data analyzed from the beginning of the science phase of the _ fermi _ mission , that is 2008 august 4 , to 2011 october 28 .",
    "both sets of data were analyzed with the _ fermi _ science tools package version 09 - 27 - 01 , available from the _ fermi _ science support center , and with the post - launch instrument response functions [ irfs , p7source_v6 , @xcite ] .",
    "only events belonging to the `` source '' class and located in a circular region of interest ( roi ) of @xmath45 radius , centered at the position of 1es 0033 + 595 , were selected .",
    "in addition , we excluded photons with zenith angles @xmath46 to limit contamination from earth limb @xmath1-rays , and data taken when the rocking angle of @xmath47 was greater than @xmath48 to avoid time intervals during which the earth entered the lat field of view .",
    "the data analysis of 1es 0033 + 595 is challenging because this source is located near the galactic plane . as a consequence , to reduce the contamination by the galactic plane diffuse emission , we decided to restrict the study to the 300mev - 300gev energy range where we can profit from the narrower point - spread function to separate the @xmath1-ray emission associated with our source from the intense galactic foreground .",
    "the analysis in the time interval simultaneous with magic observations was performed using an unbinned maximum likelihood method @xcite . instead",
    ", a binned maximum likelihood technique was used for the 38 months data set .",
    "all point sources from the 2fgl catalog @xcite located within @xmath49 of 1es 0033 + 595 , and a background model , were included in the model of the region . the background model used for the analysis includes a galactic diffuse emission component and an isotropic component ( including residual instrumental background ) , modelled with the files gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits and iso_p7v6source.txt , which are publicly available . in the full energy range analysis ,",
    "all point sources within the @xmath45 radius roi were fitted with their paramenters set free , while sources beyond @xmath45 radius roi had their parameters frozen to the values reported in 2fgl .",
    "the normalizations of the background components were allowed to vary freely .",
    "the kva ( kungliga vetenskapsakademien ) telescopes are located at la palma but operated remotely by the tuorla observatory from finland .",
    "these telescopes are used mainly for optical support observations for the magic telescopes .",
    "specifically , there is a @xmath15 cm telescope which is used for polarimetric observations and a @xmath50 cm telescope which performs simultaneous photometric observations with magic .",
    "furthermore the smaller @xmath50 cm telescope monitors potential vhe @xmath1-ray candidate agns in order to trigger magic observations if one of these selected objects is in a high optical state .",
    "such observations are performed in the r - band and the magnitude of the source is measured from ccd images using differential photometry . during the magic observation of 1es0033 + 595 the average optical flux obtained by kva was r=17.93magnitude , which corresponds to @xmath51mjy . to derive this @xmath52 in the optical band the contribution from a nearby star ( 0.22mjy ) was subtracted from the total measured flux ( nilsson et al .",
    "moreover , the brightness was corrected for galactic absorption by r=2.35mag ( schlegel et al .",

    "<S> the number of known very high energy ( vhe ) blazars is @xmath0 , which is very small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in other frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars , which emit about half of their luminosity in the @xmath1-ray domain . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , vhe blazars , if distant , allow for the study of the environment that the high - energy @xmath1-rays traverse in their path towards the earth , like the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) and the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) , and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first vhe detection of 1es0033 + 595 with a statistical significance of 5.5@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the vhe emission of this object is constant throughout the magic observations ( 2009 august and october ) , and can be parameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of @xmath3 and a photon index of ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is a relevant result because this source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date , and with further ( simultaneous ) observations could play an important role in blazar population studies , as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf .    </S>",
