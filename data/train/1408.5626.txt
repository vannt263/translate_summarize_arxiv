    "<S> counter - rotating discs can arise from the accretion of a counter - rotating gas cloud onto the surface of an existing co - rotating disc or from the counter - rotating gas moving radially inward to the outer edge of an existing disc . at the interface , the two components mix to produce gas or plasma with zero net angular momentum which tends to free - fall towards the disc center . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss high - resolution axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of viscous counter - rotating disc for cases where the two components are vertically separated and radially separated . </S>",
    "<S> the viscosity is described by an isotropic @xmath0viscosity including all terms in the viscous stress tensor . for the vertically separated components a shear layer forms between them the middle of this layer in free - fall to the disc center . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rates are increased by factors @xmath1 over that for a conventional disc rotating in one direction with the same viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical width of the shear layer and the accretion rate are strongly dependent on the viscosity and the mass fraction of the counter - rotating gas . in the case of </S>",
    "<S> radially separated components where the inner disc co - rotates and the outer disc rotates in the opposite direction , a gap between the two components opens and closes quasi - periodically . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rates are @xmath2 times larger than those for a disc rotating in one direction with the same viscosity .    </S>",
