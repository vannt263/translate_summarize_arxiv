    "the particle escape is a typical nonequilibrium phenomenon in open systems .",
    "it is a current of particles from a region where the particles were initially confined .",
    "the concept of escape has been used to describe a variety of physical phenomena , such as @xmath7-decaying nucleus @xcite , chemical reactions as kramers escape problem @xcite , etc .",
    "some dynamical properties , like chaos @xcite , the recurrence time @xcite , the first - passage time @xcite , transport coefficients @xcite , etc . , have also been investigated via escape behaviors of particles .",
    "the particle escapes were discussed in many types of systems , for example , stochastic systems @xcite , classical billiard systems @xcite , map systems @xcite and quantum systems @xcite .",
    "escape phenomena in open systems cause a decay of various quantities by a particle current from a finite region .",
    "for instance , the probability for particles to remain in the initially confined region , which we call the survival probability in this paper , would decay in time , if particles continue to be flowed out from the initial region .",
    "such decay properties in escape systems have led to some interesting results and conjectures .",
    "for example , in classical mechanical systems with a particle escape via a small hole , the survival probability would decay exponentially in time if the dynamics is chaotic , while it would decay in power for non - chaotic systems @xcite . on the other hand , in many quantum mechanical systems",
    ", the survival probability decays in a power asymptotically in time @xcite with an exponential decay for a finite time @xcite , and values of the power in the decay vary by initial conditions @xcite or particle interactions @xcite , etc .    in this paper",
    "we discuss particle escapes in quantum mechanical networks as an example of open dynamical systems .",
    "the quantum network system is also called the `` quantum graph , '' and is constructed by connecting finite and infinite narrow wires like a network , and have been widely used as models to describe mesoscopic transports like aharonov - bohm type of effects @xcite , resonance tunnellings @xcite , current splitters @xcite , chaos and diffusion @xcite , etc .",
    "steady electric currents in open quantum network systems are described by quantum scattering theory @xcite .",
    "this kind of quantum systems with narrow wires could be experimentally realized as a combination of atomic or molecular wires or as a graph - like structure on the surface of a semiconductor by a recent development of nano - technology @xcite .",
    "an important feature of network systems is an effect of current splitter at a network junction . in order to consider such a splitting effect of currents in quantum escapes as simple and concrete as possible , we consider particle escapes from a finite one - dimensional region with the length @xmath8 via @xmath0-number of semi - infinite one - dimensional leads .",
    "the multiple leads is connected at one end of the finite region with a potential barrier amplitude @xmath9 at the junction , and we impose the fixed boundary condition at another terminated end of the finite region . as a theoretical approach to describe particle escapes in such a quantum network ,",
    "we use a quantum scattering theoretical approach , by which we consider concretely decay properties of two quantities to characterize the quantum escapes .",
    "the first quantity of decaying in the particle escape is the survival probability @xmath1 for the particle to remain in the finite region at time @xmath2 .",
    "we show analytically that the survival probability @xmath1 depends on the number @xmath0 of attached semi - infinite leads as the @xmath10 proportional ratio , i.e. @xmath11=n^{2}$ ] , in the case of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 : the mass of particle , @xmath14 : the planck constant ) .",
    "this means that after a long time the particle can remain more inside the original finite region by connecting more semi - infinite leads .",
    "besides , in this case the survival probability @xmath1 decays in power @xmath15 asymptotically in time .",
    "in contrast , in the case of @xmath16 we obtain the @xmath10 inversely proportional ratio @xmath11=1/n^{2}$ ] for the survival probability @xmath1 , meaning that after a long time a particle escapes more by connecting more leads . here",
    ", the survival probability @xmath1 decays in power @xmath6 asymptotically in time , differently from the case of @xmath12 .",
    "we also discuss finite time properties of the survival probability numerically , and show that for a finite time the survival probability decays exponentially for a longer time with a smaller decay rate by connecting more number @xmath0 of leads . as the second quantity to investigate decay properties in quantum particle escapes , we consider the velocity @xmath5 for the particle to escape from the finite region , which is introduced by the equation of continuity for the particle position probability .",
    "we show analytically that the escape velocity @xmath5 behaves asymptotically in time as @xmath17 for @xmath12 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , which are independent of the number @xmath0 of leads and the initial wave function , etc .",
    "it is also shown by numerical calculations that for a finite time the escape velocity @xmath5 oscillates in time , and takes a larger magnitude of the oscillations for more number @xmath0 of attached leads .",
    "furthermore , by using a different boundary condition , our scattering approach to quantum network systems also allow us to discuss particle escapes from a finite region with the length @xmath20 whose both end are connected to @xmath0 number of semi - infinite one - dimensional leads .",
