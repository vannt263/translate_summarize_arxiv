    "infinite divisibility or stochastic stability of a random object under a certain operation is one of the most fundamental concepts in probability theory , prominent examples include the classical theory of infinite divisible and stable distributions with their applications around the central limit theorem , max - stable distributions studied in extreme value theory or union infinitely divisible random sets studied in the classical theory of random closed sets @xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper we deal with a class of non - stationary iteration infinitely divisible random tessellations of the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space and , more specifically , with stationary random tessellations that are * * st**able under the operation of * * it**eration  called stit tessellations for short .",
    "recall that a tessellation ( or mosaic ) of @xmath1 is a locally finite familiy of compact convex random polytopes , which have pairwise no common interior points , cover the whole space and that they are a central object studied in stochastic geometry and related fields , see @xcite to name just a few .",
    "+ in the stationary case , the motivation for random stit tessellations goes back to r. ambartzumian in the 80thies and the principle of iteration of tessellations can roughly be explained as follows : take a random primary or frame tessellation and associate with each of its cells independently a copy of the primary tessellation , called component tessellation , which is also independent of the primary tessellation as well .",
    "perform now in each cell a local superposition of the primary tessellation and the associated tessellation , whereupon scale the resulting random tessellation by a factor @xmath2 in order to ensure that the mean surface measure of cell boundaries stays constant .",
    "the described operation can be repeatedly applied and we obtain in this way a sequence of random tessellations .",
    "it can be shown that this sequence converges to a random limit tessellation and that this tessellation is stable under iterations  a stit tessellation  in the translation - invariant set - up . in the general case ,",
    "the resulting tessellation is iteration infinitely divisible in any finite volume . +",
    "starting with @xcite , stit tessellations and their theoretical framework were formally introduced in @xcite by nagel and weiss .",
    "the same research group discovered a first basic technique for studying mean values and even some distributions related to the geometry of stit tessellations by writing certain balance equations based on the stochastic stability of the tessellation , see @xcite for the mean values as well as @xcite for distributional results . in @xcite",
    "a new aspect was introduced into the theory , namely a tessellation - valued random markov process on the positive real half - axis with the property that at each time the law of the tessellation is stable under iteration . in finite compact convex volumes",
    "@xmath3 with @xmath4 , this process can be explained as follows : let us fix a terminal time @xmath5 and a ( in some sense non - degenerate ) translation - invariant measure @xmath6 on the space of hyperplanes in @xmath1 . in a first step , we assign to @xmath7 a random lifetime . upon expiry of its lifetime , the primordial cell @xmath7 dies and splits into two polyhedral sub - cells separated by a hyperplane hitting @xmath7 , which is chosen according to the normalized distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting new cells are again assigned independent random lifetimes and the entire construction continues recursively until the deterministic time threshold @xmath8 is reached ( see figure [ fig1 ] for an illustration ) .",
    "the resulting random tessellation is denoted by @xmath9 . in order to ensure the markov property of the above construction in the continuous - time parameter @xmath8 and in order to have distributional equality of the outcome with the above mentioned limit tessellations",
    ", we will have to take care of the special choice of the lifetime distributions , see the details in section [ secstit ] below .",
    "+ this dynamic point of view can be exploited to establish new results on stit tessellations and in fact our theory will be based on it . in addition , the finite volume markovian construction provides a link to a class of more general and non - stationary iteration infinitely divisible random mnw - tessellations , where the translation - invariant hyperplane measure @xmath6 from above is replaced by an arbitrary non - atomic and locally finite measure on the space of hyperplanes .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the dynamical representation is a special feature of stit tessellations and their infinitely divisible counterparts and , as recently pointed out by the first author @xcite , that such and similar spatio - temporal random processes have remarkable potential for applications in stochastic geometry .",
    "+ the purpose of the present paper is to explore the dynamic representation of stit tessellations further and to introduce a new technique , which has has the advantage to deal with properties of the model that were out of reach so far .",
    "the crucial observation is that the dynamic representation of the tessellations under consideration fulfils a markov property in the continuous - time parameter , which allows to construct certain martingales related to the tessellations ( see section [ secmartingale ] ) , eventually leading to fundamental comparison results of stit tessellations with certain mixtures of poisson hyperplane tessellations in section [ secfirst ] . as an application of these results",
    "we calculate new mean values and also some new distributions related to geometric objects determined by the tessellation . to keep the paper self - contained , we recall in section [ seclimit ] the construction of stit tessellations as limit of repeated iterations of tessellations and formally introduce in section [ secstit ] their markovian dynamic representation .",
    "moreover , we also introduce there the class of iteration infinitely divisible random mnw - tessellations and summarize some of their most important properties needed in this paper .",
    "+ the current work is based on an extended version available online @xcite .",
    "it also forms the basis of our subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "a tessellation of @xmath1 is a locally finite partition of the space into compact convex polytopes , the cells of the tessellation .",
    "one can regard a tessellation either as a collection of its cells or as the closed set formed by the union of their boundaries .",
    "we will mostly follow the second mentioned point of view and denote by @xmath10 the set of cells of the tessellation @xmath11 ( note that by the jordan  schnflies theorem the correspondence between @xmath11 and @xmath10 is one - to - one ) .",
    "thus , a random tessellation can be regarded as a special random closed set in the classical sense of stochastic geometry , see @xcite . in particular , this imposes the usual fell topology and the corresponding borel measurable structure on the family of tessellations , see ibidem . a random tessellation @xmath11 ( regarded as a random closed set in @xmath1 ) is called _ stationary _ if its distribution does not change upon actions of translations .",
    "analogously a random tessellation is called _ isotropic _ if its distribution is invariant under the action of @xmath12 .",
    "+ whenever we two random tessellations @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath1 are given we can define their _ iteration / nesting_. to this end , we associate to each cell @xmath15 an independent copy @xmath16 of @xmath14 and we assume furthermore the family @xmath17 to be independent of @xmath13 .",
    "then we define the iteration of @xmath13 with @xmath14 by @xmath18 i.e. we take the local superposition of @xmath13 and the family @xmath17 inside the cells of @xmath13 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath19 is a stationary random tessellation as soon @xmath13 and @xmath14 have this property .",
    "note also that the so - defined nesting operation is associative in distribution .",
    "a stationary random tessellation @xmath11 is called _",
    "stable under iteration _ , or _",
    "stit _ for short , iff @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for equality in distribution ( note that rescaling by factor @xmath22 ensures that the mean surface area of cell boundaries per unit volume remains constant ) .",
    "in fact , using the uniqueness results , see theorem 3 and corollary 2 in @xcite , it is easy to see that it is enough to take one fixed @xmath23 in ( [ itstab ] ) .",
    "+ to proceed , let us be given a constant @xmath24 and a probability measure @xmath25 on the unit sphere @xmath26 , usually identified with the induced distribution of orthogonal hyperplanes on the space of @xmath27-dimensional linear hyperplanes in @xmath28 also denoted by @xmath29 in the sequel for notational simplicity . define the measure @xmath6 on the space @xmath30 of affine hyperplanes in @xmath1 as the product measure @xmath31 of @xmath32 standing for the lebesgue measure on the positive real half - axis @xmath33 and of @xmath25 , where a pair @xmath34 is identified with the hyperplane @xmath35 throughout this paper we always require that the support of @xmath25 spans the whole space , i.e. that @xmath36 assume now that we are given a stationary random tessellation @xmath11 with surface intensity @xmath8 ( i.e. the mean surface area of cell boundaries per unit volume equals @xmath8 ) and directional distribution @xmath25 ( i.e. the distribution of the normal direction of the facet containing the typical point in the standard palm sense is given by @xmath25 ) and define the sequence @xmath37 by @xmath38 it was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) that @xmath39 converges in law , as @xmath40 to a stationary random limit tessellation @xmath41 _ uniquely determined _ by @xmath42 this tessellation is easily shown to be stable under iterations , whence a stit tessellation with parameters @xmath8 and @xmath6 and we refer to figure [ fig1 ] for an illustration .",
    "as already emphasized in the introduction , it is a crucial feature of the random tessellations @xmath41 introduced in the previous section that they admit a natural and intuitive spatio - temporal construction . for a restriction @xmath9 of @xmath41 to a compact convex window @xmath3 with interior points ,",
    "this construction can be described as follows ( the reader is referred to @xcite for full details ) : assign to the window @xmath7 an exponentially distributed random lifetime with parameter @xmath43)$ ] where @xmath44 : = \\ { h \\in { \\cal h},\\ ; h \\cap w \\neq \\emptyset \\}$ ] stands for the family of all hyperplanes hitting @xmath7 . upon expiry of its lifetime ,",
    "the cell @xmath7 dies and splits into two sub - cells @xmath45 and @xmath46 separated by a hyperplane in @xmath44 $ ] chosen according to the law @xmath47).$ ] the resulting new cells @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 are again assigned independent exponential lifetimes with respective parameters @xmath48)$ ] and @xmath49)$ ] ( whence smaller cells live stochastically longer ) and the entire construction continues recursively until the deterministic time threshold @xmath8 is reached .",
    "the cell - separating @xmath27-dimensional facets ( the word _ facet",
    "_ stands for a @xmath27-dimensional face here and throughout ) arising in subsequent splits are usually referred to as _ @xmath27-dimensional maximal polytopes _ ( or i - segments for @xmath50 as assuming shapes similar to the letter _ i _ ) .",
    "the described process of recursive cell divisions is called the mecke - nagel - weiss- or _ mnw - construction _ in the sequel and the resulting random tessellation created inside @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath9 as mentioned above , whereas the collection of all @xmath27-dimensional maximal polytopes or i - segments is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , we write @xmath52 for the collection of @xmath53-dimensional maximal polytopes of @xmath9 , where by a @xmath53-dimensional maximal polytope we mean the maximal union of connected and @xmath53-coplanar @xmath53-dimensional faces of cells . in fact , the @xmath53-dimensional maximal polytopes of @xmath9 are nothing than the @xmath53-faces of @xmath27-dimensional maximal polytopes . + it was shown in @xcite that the law of @xmath9 is consistent in that @xmath54 for convex @xmath55 and thus @xmath9 can be extended to random tessellation @xmath41 on the whole space , which is then proved ( see @xcite ) to coincide with the limit tessellation @xmath41 considered in the previous section , as the notation suggests .",
    "again , the sets of all @xmath27-dimensional and @xmath53-dimensional maximal polytopes of @xmath41 are denoted by @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , respectively .",
    "the stationary random tessellation @xmath41 is additionally isotropic if and only if @xmath25 is the uniform distribution on @xmath26 in the factorization ( [ ladef ] ) .",
    "+ a simple yet crucial observation is that even though only translation - invariant measures @xmath6 of the form ( [ ladef ] ) show up in the limiting stit tessellations , the mnw - construction can be carried out with arbitrary non - atomic and locally finite driving measure @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) < \\infty$ ] for @xmath3 bounded ) on @xmath59 also leading to a consistent family @xmath9 and eventually , by extension , yielding @xmath60 many of our theorems will be stated in this general context .",
    "it should be emphasized though that such tessellations are no longer iteration stable ( stit ) .",
    "however , they have the general property of being _ iteration infinitely divisible _ , as they can be readily checked to arise as @xmath22-fold iterations of @xmath61 for each @xmath62 in all finite volumes .",
    "formally , this means that @xmath63 for all compact convex sets @xmath64 which follows directly by the mnw - construction as yielding @xmath65 it is more than natural to expect that also @xmath66 for all @xmath22 in the whole of @xmath1 , which should be provable by adopting the theory developed in @xcite , thus even better justifying the term _ iteration infinitely divisible _ in our context , yet this falls beyond the scope of the present work and is not needed in our arguments .",
    "+ it is worth pointing out that it is currently an open problem whether _ any _ iteration infinitely divisible random tessellation in @xmath1 can be constructed with the mnw - algorithm .",
    "this means that in this paper infinite divisibility with respect to iteration only refers to such tessellations which can be obtained by the mnw - construction . for this reason ,",
    "the tessellations we are dealing with in the general set - up are called iteration infinitely divisible mnw - tessellations .",
    "the finite volume continuous - time incremental mnw - construction of iteration infinitely divisible random tessellations or more specially stationary stit tessellations , as discussed in section [ secstit ] above , clearly enjoys the markov property in the time parameter , whence natural martingales arise , which will be of crucial importance for our further considerations . to discuss these processes we need some additional terminology and notational conventions .",
    "let us fix a compact convex window @xmath7 and a general diffuse ( non - atomic ) and locally finite measure @xmath6 on @xmath67 the space of hyperplanes in @xmath1 .",
    "next , for a tessellation @xmath11 of @xmath1 and any @xmath68 $ ] , we denote by @xmath69 the set of cells the hyperplane @xmath70 is tessellated with as a result of the intersection with @xmath11 . in terms of the mnw - construction , the members of @xmath69 , which are @xmath27-dimensional polytopes , are the potentially new facets to be added to the tessellation when the construction is continued .",
    "whenever a new facet @xmath71 to be added to @xmath11 should a facet birth ( cell split ) occur on @xmath70 in @xmath11 , we denote by @xmath72 the cell splitting by the birth of @xmath73 and we write @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the two sub - cells into which @xmath72 divides , lying on the positive and negative sides of @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "+ with this notation , it is readily seen that for a fixed measure @xmath6 , @xmath76 is a pure jump markov process with values in the space of tessellations in @xmath7 and with the property that @xmath77\\lambda(dh)dt,\\ ] ] with @xmath78 $ ] , and @xmath79 } |{\\operatorname{cells}}(y\\cap h)| \\lambda(dh ) \\right ) dt\\\\     & = & 1 - \\left ( \\sum_{c \\in { \\operatorname{cells}}(y ) } \\lambda([c ] ) \\right ) dt , \\label{infineq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the cardinality of the set @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , this is because , conditionally on @xmath81 during the period @xmath82 $ ] of the mnw - construction we have , as discussed in section [ secstit ] :    * for each cell @xmath83 the probability that it undergoes a split is @xmath84 ) dt,$ ] moreover the probability that two or more cells split is @xmath85 whence the probability that no split occurs is @xmath86 ) \\right ) dt$ ] as in ( [ infineq2 ] ) . noting that @xmath87 ) = \\int_{[w]}|{\\operatorname{cells}}(y\\cap h)|\\lambda(dh)$ ] yields the remaining equality in ( [ infineq2 ] ) .",

    "it should be emphasized at this point that the _ differential _ notation in ( [ infineq1 ] ) and ( [ infineq2 ] ) employing the symbols @xmath95 and @xmath96 is widely accepted in the theory of pure jump continuous - time markov processes and makes perfect formal sense as a commonly recognized abbreviation for the usual description in terms of waiting times , with @xmath97 understood as _while in state @xmath98 wait an exponential time with parameter @xmath99 and then jump to @xmath100",
    "unless some other jump has occurred prior to that_. we refer the reader to chapter 15 in @xcite and especially to section 15.6 there , where this construction is formalized with full mathematical rigour in terms of waiting times as noted above .",
    "as readily verified , specializing the generic waiting - time construction to the case of ( [ infineq1 ] ) and ( [ infineq2 ] ) yields precisely the standard mnw construction from section [ secstit ] .",
