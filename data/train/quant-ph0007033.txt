    "the possibility of creating stationary , nondispersive , localized , wave packets describing a highly excited electron in a hydrogen atom strongly driven by circularly polarized microwave radiation was predicted theoretically several years ago @xcite and confirmed in numerous publications @xcite",
    "( for recent reviews of the subject see @xcite ) .",
    "such electronic states are called trojan wave packets by analogy with the cloud of trojan asteroid in the sun - jupiter system .    in all previous studies",
    "the microwave field was treated as an external , classical wave .",
    "dressing of an electron by such a wave of a suitably chosen intensity and the frequency equal to the kepler frequency of the electron on the rydberg orbit makes the trojan wave packets highly stable .",
    "their life - time is of the order of one second @xcite , which makes them an interesting object of study for theoretical and perhaps even for practical reasons .    in the present paper a similar problem of nondispersive electronic wave packets",
    "is studied for an atom interacting with the _ quantized _ electromagnetic field .",
    "such an approach allows for a fully dynamical treatment of an autonomous atom - field system .",
    "it automatically includes a back reaction of the atom on the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , one can study both the dynamics and the statistical properties of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "our study fully confirms the existence of trojan states of the rydberg electron in this new regime with almost exactly the same shape of the wave packet .",
    "the back reaction of the electron on the electromagnetic field pushes the field frequency off resonance .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field exhibit strong squeezing .",
    "anticipating the role of highly populated , discrete modes of the microwave field in the formation of trojan electronic states , we consider a hydrogen atom in a microwave cavity . in the presence of a cavity",
    "we can separate a finite number of relevant degrees of freedom whereas in free space we would have to deal with a continuous spectrum which precludes the existence of localized stationary states of the system .    to allow for the rotational symmetry of the atom - field system we choose a cylindrical cavity .",
    "its dimensions will be large enough to justify the dipole approximation in the coupling of hydrogen atom with the lowest cavity modes .",
    "the atom placed in the middle of cavity interacts only with @xmath0 modes .",
    "for definitness we choose the two ( degenerate ) lowest modes of this type ( @xmath1 ) ( labeled by @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) for which the mode functions have the form    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the radius and the length of the cavity and @xmath10 is the first ( the smallest ) solution of the equation @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12-axis is taken along the cylinder axis and @xmath13 .",
    "the frequency of the modes and the effective wave vector are given as @xmath14 the value of the normalization constant @xmath15 has been obtained in ref.@xcite , @xmath16 from the requirement that the energy per one photon in a mode is equal to @xmath17 .    at the position @xmath18 of the center of the atom the orthogonal field vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 point respectively in @xmath21 and @xmath22 direction and are given by simple formulas :    @xmath23    the relevant part of the electric and magnetic field in the cavity can be written in the form    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the dimensionless mode expansion amplitudes .    in the laboratory frame",
    "the dynamics of the atom - field system is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the position of the electron relative to the center of the atom @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath30 describes the mutual interaction of the atomic electron with the chosen cavity modes .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath31 using the amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 , or more conveniently , using their real combinations :    @xmath32    @xmath33    where the dimensionless vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the electric field and the magnetic induction , @xmath36 the field amplitude @xmath37 is @xmath38 we have found it convenient to use the natural units for our problem derived from the field frequency for the energy , length , and momentum : @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) in these units takes on the following form @xmath40 where the dimensionless parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 characterizing the strength of the coulomb field and the atom - field coupling are @xmath43",
    "we are interested in special solutions corresponding to the trojan states in the external electromagnetic wave introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "since these states describe electronic wave packets rotating around the nucleus along circular orbits , we transform the hamiltonian @xmath31 to the frame rotating around the @xmath12-axis with the angular velocity @xmath44 .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian is @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath12-components of the angular momenta of the electron and of the electromagnetic field are @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in this frame",
    ", the rotational states will appear as stationary states of the hamiltonian .",
    "we would like to stress that the hamiltonian @xmath49 can not be identified with the energy because of the appearance of the inertial forces in the rotating frame .    to emphasize the rotational symmetry of our problem",
    "we introduce following variables for the electromagnetic field    @xmath50    @xmath51    corresponding to the left and right circular polarization . in terms of these variables",
    "the hamiltonian takes on the form @xmath52 the kinetic part of the field hamiltonian is made up of two terms : co - rotating and counter - rotating .",
    "linear stability analysis shows that both parts are necessary for the existence of the nontrivial equilibrium solution . from the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) we derive the evolution equations :    [ evolution ] @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62    the time - independent solutions of these equations describe the stationary states of our system . equating the left hand side of eqs.([evolution ] ) to zero , we obtain    [ eqsol ] @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    in addition , the equations ( [ eq_cond1 ] ) and ( [ eq_cond2 ] ) give the equilibrium condition : @xmath67 this equilibrium condition can be used to express the equilibrium radius @xmath68 in terms of the frequency of the cavity mode @xmath69 and the frequency of rotation @xmath44 @xmath70 or , alternatively , to express the frequency of rotation in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "the equilibrium condition ( [ stabcond ] ) has two solutions for @xmath44 , denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,    @xmath73    both solutions exist for all values of @xmath68 .",
    "the solution @xmath74 ( @xmath71 ) gives the frequency that is always higher ( lower ) than the cavity frequency @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "[ omegas ] ) . the higher frequency ( larger centrifugal force )",
    "requires the electric field to be directed towards the nucleus , whereas the lower frequency requires the field pointing outwards .",
    "the first case corresponds to the trojan states whereas the second to the so called anti - trojan states . in the previous study @xcite , when the electromagnetic field has been treated as a given external wave",
    ", the anti - trojan states were found to be classically unstable .",
    "the classical stability obtained in the present study is due to the detuning from the exact resonance .",
    "since the localization of the electronic wave packet is much worse for the anti - trojan states ( classically , the trajectories in the rotating frame are spread almost evenly around the whole circle , cf .",
    "[ anti ] ) , we will restrict ourselves to the trojan states only .",
    "hence , in what follows , we shall only consider the solution @xmath71 .",
    "note , that for @xmath75 ( i.e. @xmath76 ) , we have only a trivial result @xmath77 which in the classical model of an atom , means that `` the electron has fallen onto the nucleus '' and the electric field is zero .",
    "thus , every nontrivial solution requires the presence of a detuning ( @xmath78 ) between the cavity frequency and the kepler frequency .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the frequency pushing and is a direct consequence of the mutual atom - field interaction .",
    "this detuning has been absent in all previous approaches where the atom was driven by an external wave .",
    "the equations ( [ evolution ] ) have a continuum of time - independent solutions that can be labeled by @xmath68 and the angle @xmath79 in the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane .",
    "these solutions describe in the laboratory frame a classical electron circulating around the nucleus at the distance @xmath68 .",
    "the orbit of the electron is confined to the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane .",
    "the electron is dressed by the classical electromagnetic field @xmath80 which has a resonance dependence on the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "note that the electric field changes its sign when the frequency of rotation passes through the resonance .",
    "next , we expand the hamiltonian around a time - independent solution and investigate its linear stability",
    ". the motion will be stable if all eigenfrequencies are real .",
    "the characteristic equation for this problem has the form    @xmath82    2 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the first ( @xmath85 ) frequency in our problem corresponds to the rotation of the whole system and it is a reflection of the rotational symmetry .",
    "the second frequency ( @xmath86 ) corresponds to the motion in the @xmath12-direction that ( in the linear approximation ) is decoupled from the motion in the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane .",
    "the remaining 3 frequencies correspond to the motion of the electron coupled to the electromagnetic field .",
    "we shall not produce the analytical expressions for these eigenfrequencies but in fig .",
    "[ stability ] we plot the region of stability in the @xmath8-@xmath68 plane .    the stability can also be studied numerically and the calculations of the classical trajectories fully confirm the stability of the equilibrium solution . in fig .",
    "[ xymotion ] we plotted the projection of a typical electron trajectory on the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane for the time interval @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .",
    "the trajectory started at the equilibrium position @xmath89 with the initial momenta @xmath90 . as we see",
    ", the electron follows a rather complicated , but bounded , trajectory .",
    "obviously , if we choose @xmath91 sufficiently large the electron will eventually leave the vicinity of the equilibrium point . in fig .",
    "[ zphase ] we show the @xmath12-@xmath92 cross - section of the phase space for the same trajectory .",
    "this phase - space trajectory resembles the trajectory of a simple harmonic oscillator . indeed , as we have seen , in the linearized evolution equations , the motion in the @xmath12-direction is purely harmonic .",
    "thus , the interesting dynamics of the electron is found in the motion confined to the @xmath21-@xmath22 plane and in what follows we shall treat our problem as two - dimensional .",
    "since our system is conservative , it has a well defined energy @xmath30 .",
    "we have calculated its value @xmath93 for all those solutions that in the rotating frame are determined by eqs.([eqsol ] ) .",
    "this energy is given by the formula @xmath94 and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ energy ] as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "the infinite growth of the energy near the resonance ( @xmath95 expresses the phenomenon of the frequency pushing .",
    "in order to study the quantum effects for the electron as well as for the electromagnetic field we will apply the procedure of the quantization around the classical solution ( [ eqsol ] ) .",
    "a similar quantization method has been used before , for example in nonlinear optics to describe quantum fluctuations around the classical solitons in fibers @xcite . here , the quantization will lead to the description of the electron in terms of a quantum mechanical wave packet orbiting along the classical trajectory and , at the same time , will reveal quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field around its classical value .    as a starting point",
    "we choose the hamiltonian ( [ hrot ] ) in which all variables are treated as operators and we express them as sums of their classical parts and the quantum corrections @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the classical parts represent equilibrium solutions ( [ eqsol ] ) found in the preceding section . in order to simplify the notation ,",
    "we have not attached any labels to the operators of quantum corrections @xmath100 .",
    "next , we expand the hamiltonian around the classical equilibrium solution neglecting all terms higher then quadratic in the quantum corrections . to proceed along these lines , we have to choose one solution , labeled by @xmath101 , from the whole family of equilibrium solutions . making this choice",
    "we break the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "this mechanism of selection of a specific classical solution resembles the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is present in many branches of physics .",
    "it explains the appearance of deformed nuclei , the formation of magnetic domains in ferromagnetic materials , or the emergence of higgs particles in the glashow - weinberg - salam model of electroweak interactions . in all these cases",
    "the symmetry is broken by the choice of a particular ground state . in our case , however , we do not break the symmetry by choosing a ground state but by choosing an equilibrium state of the hamiltonian that is very far from the ground state of the system .",
    "once we have chosen some @xmath101 , we can rotate the frame of reference , so that the direction given by @xmath101 is along the @xmath21 axis .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian is @xmath102 \\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac{1+\\kappa}{2}\\left(p_{+}^{2}+q_{+}^{2}\\right ) + \\frac{1-\\kappa}{2}\\left(p_{-}^{2}+q_{-}^{2}\\right ) \\\\ &",
    "-&q\\kappa^2x^2+\\frac{q\\kappa^2y^2}{2}+\\frac{q\\kappa^2z^2}{2 } -\\kappa(x p_y - x p_x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath103 , the ratio of the coulomb force to the centrifugal force , @xmath104 has been introduced to achieve the full correspondence with the notation used before @xcite in the description of trojan states .",
    "note , that in this hamiltonian the quadratic term @xmath105 enters with the negative coefficient .",
    "if it were not for the rotational term , such a hamiltonian would not have any stable points . in our case , however , the stability can be achieved for a particular choice of @xmath42 , @xmath103 and @xmath81 .",
    "we look for the fundamental solution of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath106 in the form of a four - dimensional gaussian function @xmath107 @xmath108 , and @xmath109 inserting this ansatz into the schrdinger equation we obtain 10 algebraic , nonlinear equations for the parameters @xmath110 :    @xmath111    @xmath112    @xmath113    @xmath114    @xmath115    @xmath116    @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    @xmath120    2 we can easily solve these equations numerically , but first we want to find a perturbative solution . in order to do that we write the coupling constant in the form @xmath121 .",
    "obviously @xmath122 , and we will treat @xmath123 as a small parameter .",
    "typical values of the parameters are @xmath124 which give @xmath125 .",
    "one can ask why we can not treat @xmath42 ( or even simpler , @xmath126 ) as a perturbation parameter .",
    "however , if we do so we face a problem : the coefficients of the perturbation series are growing , since they behave as @xmath127 .",
    "when we tend with @xmath128 to zero we hit exactly the resonance point and the perturbation expansion becomes meaningless . on the other hand , when @xmath123 is chosen as an expansion parameter , all large contributions to the coefficients in the perturbation expansion @xmath129 cancel out .",
    "we calculated analytically the coefficients up to the second order but we present here the analytic formulas only in the zeroth order and numerical values of the first and the second order corrections .",
    "@xmath130    where @xmath131 , @xmath132 thus , in the zeroth order , the electronic part of the wave packet is exactly the same as in the case of externally driven trojan wave packet @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic part has a form of a coherent ( nonsqueezed ) state .",
    "higher corrections are due to the mutual interaction between the field and the atom .",
    "numerical values of the parameters @xmath110 are calculated for the cavity parameters @xmath133 cm , @xmath134 cm , which give @xmath135 ghz and @xmath136 .",
    "the detuning @xmath81 is chosen in such a way , that the value of @xmath103 is optimal , @xmath137 .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the wave packet is then maximally concentrated around the equilibrium point and its center is located at @xmath138 ( @xmath139 is the atom bohr radius ) .",
    "the expansion coefficients calculated up to the second order are presented in table 1 .",
    "in this order we observe the effect of the back reaction of the electron on the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , the coefficients @xmath140 , and @xmath141 characterizing the shape of the electronic wave packet are the same as in the zeroth order within the assumed accuracy .",
    "finally , we present in table 2 the results of a direct numerical solution of our set of equations . as we see , almost all the coefficients have been obtained correctly already in the second order of perturbation theory .",
    "only the @xmath142 differs from the exact numerical solution .",
    "this can be attributed to the very slowly convergent perturbation series for this particular coefficient .",
    "the coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath144 describing the mixing of the atomic part of the wave packet with the field part are not zero .",
    "moreover , the electromagnetic field is strongly affected by the interaction with the atom ; the coefficient @xmath142 is significantly different from its value in the zeroth order .",
    "the four - dimensional gaussian wave packet ( [ gaussian ] ) with the coefficients @xmath110 calculated numerically describes the fundamental state of the mutually interacting atom - field system . owing to its gaussian form",
    ", this state saturates the multidimensional generalized uncertainty relations for the complete atom - field system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the smallness of the coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath144 expresses the fact that the field and the atom are only very weakly correlated in this state . as a result of this , the saturation of the uncertainty relations is almost exact , separately for both parts of the wave function .",
    "the average values of second moments the electronic variables calculated with the numerical values of the coefficients taken from the table 2 are given in table 3 .",
    "this table exhibits the existence of correlations between the variables in the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 directions .",
    "this requires the use of generalized uncertainty relations for a two - dimensional system in the form ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite )    @xmath145    upon substituting the values taken from the table 3 we find an almost exact saturation of these relations .",
    "now , we turn to the description of the quantum correlations for the electromagnetic field in our fundamental state of the atom - field system . the second moments for the field variables are given in the table 4 .",
    "these values of the correlations imply an almost complete decoupling between the co - rotating and counter - rotating modes so that the uncertainty is almost saturated separately for each mode .",
    "the state of the field in the counter - rotating mode is a coherent state but the state in the co - rotating mode is highly squeezed ; the ratio of the correlation for the two quadratures @xmath146 and @xmath147 is about @xmath148 .",
    "however , the fluctuations of the field are still small as compared to the field value @xmath149",
    ". the plots of the wigner function in figs.[wigplus ] and [ wigminus ] illustrates the difference in quantum fluctuations between the counter - rotating and the co - rotating modes .",
    "we have shown that the dynamical treatment of the relevant modes of the electromagnetic field enables one to reproduce exactly the properties of the trojan states studied previously in the presence of a given , external wave . however , there appear new features totally absent in the previous studies .",
    "first , the back reaction of the electron on the electromagnetic field causes the detuning from the exact resonance . as a result",
    ", the stability region covers now also the anti - trojan states , that were before found to be classically unstable .",
    "second , our analysis has shown that to achieve the equilibrium state of the mutually interacting atom - field system we must take into account both polarization modes of the field : co - rotating and counter - rotating .",
    "the inclusion of only the co - rotating mode , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not sufficient to achieve an equilibrium state .",
    "the quantization procedure adopted by us in this work consists in quantizing the corrections to the classical solution .",
    "these quantum corrections describe the shape of the electronic wave packet and the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field around its classical value .",
    "the field fluctuations turn out to be significantly different for the two modes : for the counter - rotating mode the fluctuations are as for the vacuum state whereas for the co - rotating mode they exhibit strong squeezing .",
    "the choice of one particular solution from the class of equivalent classical solutions spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "the method of quantization around the classical solution used here can be also applied to a similar problem of electronic trojan states in a polar molecule @xcite . in this case , the role of the electromagnetic field is played by the rotating molecular dipole .",
    "the application of our method would require the dynamical treatment of the relevant molecular degrees of freedom .",
