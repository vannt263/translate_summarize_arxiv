    "in this work we study the possibility of a standard model gauge - singlet vector - like fermion ( vlf , @xmath0 ) to be a dark matter candidate .",
    "the dark matter interacts with the visible standard model ( sm ) sector through an sm gauge - singlet scalar ( @xmath1 ) which has vector - like quark ( vlq ) loop - induced couplings to di - photons and di - gluons , and also possibly via the higgs portal .",
    "the emphasis in this work will be the former loop - induced couplings , with the latter higgs portal contribution sub - dominant , which helps evade the somewhat tight lhc di - higgs channel constraints which forces a small higgs - singlet mixing .",
    "these ingredients could be present in various bsm frameworks and our analysis here could be useful in such settings .",
    "we compute the dark matter relic - density , the dark - matter - nucleon direct - detection cross section , the present direct lhc constraints , the lhc gluon - gluon - fusion rate and the lhc diphoton rate for various total widths of the @xmath1 , as a function of the effective gluon - gluon - scalar ( @xmath2 ) and gamma - gamma - scalar ( @xmath3 ) effective couplings .",
    "we also present the perturbative unitarity bounds on the @xmath1 couplings to vector - like fermions . if @xmath4 , the @xmath5 decays contribute to @xmath6 .",
    "we perform our analysis first in a model independent manner that could be useful for many models , and apply it to our model subsequently .    if the @xmath1 and the sm higgs ( @xmath7 ) are coupled via a cubic or quartic interaction , and if there is a non - zero vacuum expectation value of the singlet scalar , the @xmath1 could mix with @xmath7 after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this mixing induces a coupling between the dark - matter and @xmath1 sector and the standard model ( sm ) sector .",
    "interestingly , in the model we consider , the visible and hidden sectors do not decouple in the limit of the higgs - portal mixing going to zero since the effective @xmath2 and @xmath8 couplings induced by vlq remain as couplings between the two sectors .",
    "we investigate these aspects in this work , and find that the higgs - portal mixing ( i.e. @xmath9 mixing ) is constrained to be very small by the present di - higgs lhc search limits , and therefore our focus in this work is on the vlq loop - induced scalar mediation possibility .",
    "when the higgs - portal mixing is negligibly small , the @xmath10 self - annihilation process which sets the relic - density in the early universe is mediated by @xmath1 in the @xmath11-channel , and the interaction of the dark matter with a nucleon that leads to direct - detection signals is mediated by the @xmath1 in the @xmath12-channel .",

    "is also carried out in refs .",

    "we also present the constraint on the @xmath14 mixing angle ( @xmath15 ) from the lhc @xmath16 channel results  @xcite , which is not analyzed in the references mentioned above .",
    "usually in the literature only the @xmath7 mediated processes are included in the dark matter direct - detection cross section calculations . however , for small @xmath15 ( or when there is no mixing ) , the @xmath7 mediated processes are suppressed , and the @xmath1 mediated process due to the @xmath2 and @xmath8 effective coupling induced by vlqs that we analyze here are important .",
    "our results here are relevant in this context . ref .",
    "@xcite does include this contribution , although in the context of scalar dark matter , but in their case the dominant contribution is the higgs - scalar mixing contribution .",

    "<S> we consider a gauge - singlet vector - like fermion dark matter model that also contains a gauge - singlet scalar and an su(2 ) singlet vector - like quark . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter has a tree - level coupling with the gauge - singlet scalar but communicates with the standard model via loop - level scalar - gluon - gluon and scalar - photon - photon effective couplings induced by the vector - like quark . </S>",
    "<S> the main focus of the paper is to study the implications of such effective couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we also include the higgs - portal coupling of the dark matter due to scalar - higgs mixing . in the model parameter space , </S>",
    "<S> we present the dark matter relic - density , the dark - matter - nucleon direct - detection scattering cross - section , the large hadron collider diphoton resonance signal rate , and the theoretical upper - bounds on the fermion - scalar couplings from perturbative unitarity . </S>"
