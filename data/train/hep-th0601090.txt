    "to some extent , our understanding of area laws in confining gauge theories is based on intuition and plausibility .",
    "certainly , there can be no doubt that , in the fundamental representation of @xmath6 , the expectation value @xmath7 of the trace of a simple flat wilson loop @xmath8 involves the area @xmath9 of the flat surface spanning it and not the area of any other spanning surface : @xmath10;\\ ; \\langle w \\rangle = \\exp [ -k_fa].\\ ] ] [ here @xmath1 is the fundamental string tension , and we use imaginary anti - hermitean gauge potentials , incorporating the gauge coupling @xmath11 in them . ] but , at least in the center vortex picture of confinement , it is not always easy to see how some of these plausible results follow from the basically simple mechanism of confinement , based on linkages of vortices with wilson loops . in this paper",
    "we discuss several confinement puzzles , all of them connected by the theme of inert vortices . by this",
    "we mean vortices that do not link to wilson loops in the usual way , but occupy space that could have been occupied by truly - linked vortices . for brevity",
    "we also use this term to refer to partially - inert vortices that are linked , but with a smaller link number than would naively be expected .",
    "we seek the effects of inert vortices only for large wilson loops , those whose length scales are all large compared to the fundamental gauge - theory length @xmath12 .",
    "as the loop scales approach @xmath12 the effects of inert vortices either disappear or are substantially modified .    in the center vortex picture",
    ", the area law arises through group - center phase factors raised to powers depending on the gauss link number of the vortex condensate with the wilson loop .",
    "this link number can be calculated from the intersections of a vortex with any surface spanning the wilson loop . to characterize the condensate we will stick for simplicity to d=3 , although there is no real qualitative difference between three and four dimensions . in d=3",
    ", vortices are closed stringlike tubes of chromomagnetic flux , a finite fraction of which have infinite length , and in d=4 they are closed 2-surfaces , whose description raises complications . in @xmath13",
    "we model the vortices as closed self - avoiding infinite - length random walks on a cubical lattice of lattice length @xmath12 .",
    "this model is similar in spirit , if not in implementation , to the @xmath14 models for @xmath4 and @xmath5 center vortices given by others @xcite , for use in lattice computations .",
    "it is also similar to the usual identification of center vortices as infinitesimally - thick objects , called p - vortices @xcite , that live on a lattice dual to the lattice where wilson loops live .    even for the archetypical example of a flat wilson loop for @xmath4 ,",
    "inert vortices are important . in this simple case , there are many types of inert vortices , including those that pierce the surface twice within a few characteristic lengths @xmath12 , or that pierce it an odd number of times but have link number less than the number of pierce points .",
    "the net effect of inert vortices for a simple flat wilson loop is that the density of linkage differs from the density of piercing by a factor @xmath0 , which we call the dilution factor , lying between zero and one .",
    "this factor is a rough but useful estimate of the various ways in which vortices can be inert . in sec .",
    "[ wloops ] we estimate that @xmath0 lies in the range 0.6@xmath150.1 . in the dilute gas approximation ( dga ) , the usual result for the @xmath4 fundamental string tension @xmath1 is @xmath16 ; dilution by inert vortices modifies this to @xmath17 [ for @xmath5 , the standard dga gives @xmath18 ; the diluted dga is @xmath19 , as for @xmath4",
    ". it may be that the @xmath5 dilution factor @xmath20 is not precisely the same numerically as it is for @xmath4 , but our estimates are not accurate enough to see much of a difference .",
    "for general @xmath6 there are in principle as many dilution factors as vortex densities . ]",
    "it would , of course , be good to compare our estimates with lattice data .",
    "unfortunately , it has turned out @xcite to be rather difficult to calculate the density @xmath2 on the lattice , for a number of reasons . among these",
    "are the dependence on gauge of the center - vortex location procedures ; effects of gribov copies ; and finite - size effects .",
    "@xcite states that lattice artifacts are so important that these authors can not really find a reliable value for @xmath2 .",
    "however , @xcite claims a value of @xmath21 of 1.4 , which taken literally might indicate a dilution factor around 0.7 , at least if the dga is more or less correct .",
    "the best way to attack the numerical estimation of dilution might be to simulate directly a model of self - avoiding random walks , in the spirit of @xcite , rather than to work with qcd itself .",
    "a second major issue arises because link numbers can be calculated ( through stokes theorem ) by counting intersections of vortices with a surface spanning the wilson loop , but any spanning surface can be used for the link - number calculation , not just the surface that ultimately appears in the area law .",
    "so it is not clear what area is to be used in the area law , nor even why there is a unique area .",
    "we discuss these issues in sec .",
    "[ unlink ] , showing how unlinked vortices resolve the paradox of two or more possible areas for a simple wilson loop .    the third issue , elaborated in sec .  [ 2loops ] ,",
    "is an interesting variant on the question of when vortices are linked or not .",
    "this issue was raised before at a qualitative level @xcite .",
    "we consider two identical wilson loops separated by a certain distance , and ask how the overall vev of these two loops depends on separation . for @xmath4",
    "this is a problem somewhat like the corresponding soap - bubble problem , where there are ( at least ) two minimal soap films that can appear for two wire frames close to one another .",
    "we can think of each loop as a @xmath22 meson , and our results indicate a van der waals potential between the two loops , which breaks ( as also happens for soap bubbles ) at a critical separation between the loops .",
    "similar but more elaborate results hold for @xmath5 .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ baryon ] we consider the baryonic area law for @xmath5 .",
    "this has been explored in center vortex theory @xcite , where it is shown that the area law comes from three surfaces with quark world lines and a central line as boundaries .",
    "to some extent the baryonic area law seems to have issues like those of the double wilson loop in sec .  [",
    "2loops ] ; in particular , there might appear to be correlations like the van der waals potential of the two - loop problem that could modify the accepted baryonic area law .",
    "however , we show that analogs of the inert vortices in the two - loop problem , which are in fact not inert even though they are in the same geometry except for orientation effects , do not affect the fact that the linearly - rising potential for the three quarks has precisely the mesonic string tension for each of its three sheets .",
    "[ conc ] contains a summary .    except for secs .",
    "[ principles ] , [ wloops ] we use the dga approximation to describe our results .",
    "but it turns out to be convenient , for these two other sections , to use a standard form @xcite of the area law that contains the dga as a limiting low - density case .",
    "the center - vortex picture for gauge group @xmath6 invokes a vortex condensate . if @xmath23 there are @xmath24 types of vortices labeled by an integer @xmath25 that gives the vortex magnetic flux in units of @xmath26 . a vortex labeled",
    "@xmath27 is the antivortex of the vortex labeled @xmath28 .",
    "these vortices are characterized by an areal density @xmath29 for each vortex type . by this areal density",
    "we mean ( in all dimensions , not just @xmath13 ) that the average number of @xmath27-vortices that pierce any flat surface of area @xmath9 is @xmath30 .",
    "there is not much theoretical insight into the values of these different densities for @xmath6 with @xmath31 .",
    "however , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 there is only one density , which we term @xmath2 , that sets the scale for the string tension ( in @xmath5 there are two types of vortices , but one is the antivortex of the other and they have the same densities ) . in this paper",
    "we will only consider gauge groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a condensate of vortices can form only if a finite fraction of them has essentially unbounded length ( or an unbounded number of steps in the random walks describing the vortices ) .",
    "only such vortices , long compared to any wilson loop scale , can contribute to the area law .",
    "these can be linked or not , depending on the circumstances we encounter .",
    "finite - length vortices are therefore inert , in our terminology , and will be accounted for by a renormalization factor that we will not attempt to calculate here .",
    "consider now a simple flat wilson loop and the flat surface spanning it .",
    "this surface is taken to lie in a plan of the lattice dual to the vortex lattice and is divided into squares of this dual lattice ; we call these @xmath12-squares .",
    "any such square is pierced by a single vortex with probability @xmath32 .",
    "this probability is related to the areal density of the vortex condensate by @xmath33 the probability that a square is unoccupied is @xmath34 . as on the lattice",
    ", @xmath32 can be extracted @xcite from the vev of a square wilson loop one lattice unit on a side .",
    "denote this vev as @xmath35 ; then for @xmath4 @xmath36.\\ ] ] the only difference from the lattice definition is that in lattice computations the length scale for the wilson loop is not a physical quantity @xmath12 but a lattice spacing , and the lattice version of @xmath32 must be scaled via the renormalization group to find a physical probability , such as used in the present model [ eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) ] .",
    "note that @xmath32 is bounded by 1/2 , since @xmath35 lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "moreover , note that the probability @xmath32 as derived from eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) is not subject to dilution , which applies only to large wilson loops .",
    "the assumption that vortices in different @xmath12-squares are statistically independent leads to the standard argument for center - vortex confinement , which ignores inert vortices .",
    "the confining area law ( discarding perimeter effects ) for a wilson loop follows from an ensemble average of center - group elements .",
    "each of these is of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an element of the center of the gauge group as specified by the properties of the @xmath39 vortex ( and the group representation of the loop itself ) .",
    "for example , for the fundamental wilson loop in @xmath4 the only non - trivial element of the center has @xmath40 . in the above product",
    ", @xmath41 is the gauss linking number of this vortex with the wilson loop .",
    "the gauss linking number , a topological quantity , can be written as an intersection number of the vortex and any surface spanning the wilson loop ; its ( integral ) value is independent of the choice of surface . in the @xmath4 case",
    "the necessary average is @xmath42\\rangle.\\ ] ]    aside from the assumption of independent @xmath12-squares , the critical assumption for expressing confinement in the center - vortex picture is that @xmath32 is the probability that a vortex is actually linked once to a flat wilson loop .",
    "when an odd number of vortices is linked once , the wilson loop has value -1 and when an even number is linked , the value is + 1 .",
    "if the assumption is true , the area law follows from multiplying the probabilities @xmath43 of eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) for all the @xmath12-squares of the spanning surface .    another useful way of expressing this area law is to write out the combinatorics for vortex occupancy of @xmath44 sites of a surface spanning a wilson loop @xmath8 : @xmath45^{n_s}=[1 - 2p]^{a_s/\\lambda^2}.\\ ] ] here the number @xmath46 of sites on a given spanning surface @xmath47 is @xmath48 , where the surface has area @xmath49 , and each term represents the number of ways of arranging empty and once - filled @xmath12-squares .    next we need to modify the area law for dilution , which arises from several factors : if a vortex penetrates an even number @xmath50 of times , there are @xmath51 sites that lead to unit phase factor in the wilson - loop vev , although these sites are occupied . in effect , the vortices filling such sites are inert ( although they may , strictly speaking , be linked to the wilson loop topologically ) . similarly , if a vortex penetrates an odd number ( greater than 1 ) of times it is linked and gives a non - trivial phase factor , but three or more sites are occupied , rather than the single site assumed when we related the string tension and the piercing probability as in eq .",
    "( [ vev ] ) .",
    "we will argue in sec .",
    "[ alpha ] that the diluted form of the standard equation ( [ vev ] ) is @xmath52^{a_s/\\lambda^2},\\ ] ] yielding a string tension @xmath53 the dga approximation is the small-@xmath32 limit of either eq .",

    "( [ dilstring ] ) [ diluted ; see eq .",
    "( [ kvrho ] ) ] .",
    "note that while the effect of dilution on the probability @xmath32 is simply to renormalize it , the effect of dilution on a dimensionless quantity such as @xmath21 can not be characterized as a renormalization of a dimensionful quantity such as the density @xmath2 or the @xmath12-square area @xmath54 : @xmath55    it seems very difficult to resolve dilution problems completely by analytic methods ; the best we can do is to give a semi - quantitative discussion of how these factors renormalize downward the linkage probability from @xmath32 .",
    "in this section , dealing with the gauge group @xmath4 , we distinguish between the previously - introduced probability @xmath32 that a vortex pierces a @xmath12-square , thus contributing unit link number , and the density of link number per @xmath12-square , which is what we really need .",
    "this density is reduced by inert - vortex effects .",
    "we attempt to capture , in some mean - field sense , these effects approximately by introducing a dilution factor @xmath0 that effectively reduces the pierce probability @xmath32 to @xmath56 .",
    "we begin by classifying various ways in which vortices can pierce a spanning surface yet not be linked ( in the sense that they are associated with a trivial phase factor ) , or are linked but are to be associated with a reduced density of linkage numbers . for brevity we refer to all these as inert vortices .",
    "it is useful to distinguish three types of inert vortices ; only types ii and iii need detailed discussion .",
    "type i vortices have finite length , and correspond in some sense to localized particles .",
    "the vortex condensate may have some of these , but they can not explain confinement , since for large wilson loops those that are linked contribute only to sub - area effects such as perimeter terms in the vev .",
    "presumably the effect of such vortices is essentially to renormalize the areal density of vortices of unbounded length",
    ". we will not discuss such finite - length vortices any further , so from now on we are only concerned with the issue of vortices much longer than any wilson loop scale , and the extent to which these are or are not inert .    the distinction between the remaining two types of long vortices is this .",
    "type ii vortices exhibit what we will call local return , by which we mean that a vortex , however long , penetrating a localized flat surface has its highest probability of returning to that surface after only a few more steps of the random walk .",
    "this probability is not to be confused with the probability that a random walk will be near to where it has been after a large number @xmath57 of steps ; this probability decreases like @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the dimension of space - time ( see the appendix ) . for the present section , dealing with a flat spanning surface , this type is important , but once the renormalization of @xmath32 has been made , they are not very important in the further applications of secs .",
    "[ unlink ] , [ 2loops ] .",
    "finally , a type iii vortex is one which , having penetrated a surface , penetrates it a second time with high probability after a large number of steps .",
    "this can only be true , in view of the above remarks , if the surface is of a special type , including those used in secs .",
    "[ unlink ] , [ 2loops ] , and [ baryon ] such as a closed surface or one that has curvature radii comparable to its length scales .",
    "an infinite - length vortex must penetrate a closed surface at least twice .",
    "a qualitative model of type iii effects might be to assume that after renormalization for the effects of types i and ii vortices , the remaining effects are seen for vortices composed of infinitely - long straight lines intersecting surfaces compounded of flat segments .",
    "the rationale for the straight - line vortices is that the local returns have been accounted for by renormalization for type ii vortices . in this model",
    "no vortex can return locally to a single surface element and so explicit type ii vortices are missing ; more than one flat surface segment must be involved , and these must form a non - planar surface .",
    "we will not use this model in the present paper .    among the type",

    "[ fig1](c ) shows another inert vortex , using three additional steps , that makes the square labeled x inaccessible for piercing by another vortex , because of the mutual - avoidance requirement .",
    "[ fig1](d ) shows a vortex with four extra steps that is linked , but has pierced three @xmath12-squares , thereby again reducing the @xmath12-squares available for more vortices .",
    "note that in every case shown in the figure except for fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) the link number is reduced relative to the piercing number .",
    "there are other ways for vortices to be inert , for example , a vortex may have a link number that is a multiple of @xmath60 for @xmath6 with @xmath61 .",
    "related effects take place in the baryonic area law for @xmath5 ( sec .",
    "[ baryon ] ) .",
    "the flat surface is divided , as before , into @xmath44 @xmath12-squares . of these , on the average @xmath63 are pierced once by a vortex , and of the pierced squares , a fraction @xmath0 on the average contribute to the area - law formula with a minus sign ( in @xmath4 ) .",
    "we use a simple statistical model , ignoring shape effects and certain correlations and assuming that dilution is statistically independent of piercing .",

    "the dga is perhaps made more plausible by dilution .",
    "not all the effects of inert vortices can be captured by the simple dilution factor defined above .",
    "vortices are correlated with each other through self - avoidance , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , and the specific geometry of the portion of a random vortex walk that penetrates the spanning surface more than once can matter .",
    "unfortunately , even simpler problems can not be solved analytically .",
    "for example , the statistics of co - existing but mutually- and self - avoiding monomers and dimers ( see @xcite for a mean - field approach and earlier references ) , has no exact solution ( except in the limit of close - packed dimers @xcite ) .",
    "this is because dimers and higher multimers do not obey simple ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , multinomial ) statistics .",
    "one can appreciate this from the observation that on an empty lattice of @xmath44 sites a dimer can be laid down in @xmath70 ways , but only @xmath71 self - avoiding dimers can be put down in total .",
    "( for monomers , of course , these two numbers are the same , namely @xmath44 . )    in the inert - vortex problem there are , in principle , a huge number of multimers , of various shapes and sizes , that should be accounted for . rather than attempting some elaborate generalization of the monomer - dimer problem , we proceed as follows .",
    "the problem is to estimate the probability that a self - avoiding random walk of infinite length , having pierced the wilson surface ( which we call @xmath72 ) once , pierces it again one or more times .",
    "we need two different types of probabilities for this problem .",
    "the first is the standard probability density @xmath73 that a random walk on the @xmath13 lattice is at the lattice point @xmath74 after exactly @xmath60 steps .",
    "if the difficult restriction of self - avoidance is dropped , this is given by ( see , _ e. g. _ , @xcite ) @xmath75 [ \\cos \\theta_1+\\cos \\theta_2+\\cos \\theta_3]^n\\exp [ i\\vec{\\theta}\\cdot\\vec{m}].\\ ] ] this is normalized so that @xmath76 and the sum over all @xmath74 of this density yields unity . in the limit of large @xmath60 and components of @xmath74 ( which is an integer - valued vector ) @xmath73 has the usual gaussian form .",
    "this is not the probability of real interest , although it can be used in certain circumstances to find the probability that we need .",

    "the probability density @xmath78 is simply @xmath73 with @xmath74 restricted to the wilson surface .",

    "<S> in center vortex theory , beyond the simplest picture of confinement several conceptual problems arise that are the subject of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> recall that confinement arises through configuration averaging of phase factors associated with the gauge center group , raised to powers depending on the total gauss link number of a vortex ensemble with a given wilson loop . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest approach to confinement counts this link number by counting the number of vortices , considered in d=3 as infinitely - long closed self - avoiding random walks of fixed step length , piercing any surface spanning the wilson loop . </S>",
    "<S> problems arise because a given vortex may pierce a given spanning surface several times without being linked or without contributing a non - trivial phase factor , or it may contribute a non - trivial phase factor appropriate to a smaller number of pierce points . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the dilution factor @xmath0 , due to these inert or partially - inert vortices , that reduces the ratio of fundamental string tension @xmath1 to the areal density @xmath2 of vortices from the ratio given by elementary approaches and find @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> then we show how inert vortices resolve the problem that the link number of a given vortex - wilson loop configuration is the same for any spanning surface of whatever area , yet a unique area ( of a minimal surface ) appears in the area law . </S>",
    "<S> third , we discuss semi - quantitatively a configuration of two distinct wilson loops separated by a variable distance , and show how inert vortices govern the transition between two possible forms of the area law ( one at small loop separation , the other at large ) , and point out the different behaviors in @xmath4 and higher groups , notably @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a finite - range van der waals force between the two loops . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in a problem related to the double - loop problem , we argue that the analogs of inert vortices do not affect the fact that in the @xmath5 baryonic area law , the mesonic string tension appears . </S>"
