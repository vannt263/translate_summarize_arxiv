    "let @xmath0 be a complete riemannian manifold with infinite measure .",
    "the riesz transform @xmath15 on @xmath0 is the operator @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the positive laplace operator on @xmath0 .",
    "the riesz transform is always a bounded map from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "it is of interest to figure out the range of @xmath20 for which @xmath15 extends to a bounded map @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently , we can ask whether @xmath21it has been shown in @xcite that the riesz transform is bounded on @xmath9 for @xmath22 as soon as the manifold satisfies the doubling property as well as a natural heat kernel upper bound . the situation for @xmath10 is more complicated :",
    "there is some understanding of what happens in the more restricted class of manifolds satisfying upper and lower gaussian estimates for the heat kernel ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and it is also known that the above more general assumptions do not imply the boundedness of the riesz transform for all @xmath23 . the counterexample is simply the connected sum of two copies of @xmath24 , where one easily sees that the riesz transform is unbounded for @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) , precisely because the boundedness for such @xmath20 would imply a lower gaussian heat kernel estimate on this manifold , which is known to be false .",
    "the first aim of the present article is to find out what happens in the remaining range @xmath26 , and to treat more generally by the same token manifolds with a finite number of euclidean ends .",
    "our second aim is to give , in a somewhat more general class of manifolds , a cohomological consequence of the boundedness of the riesz transform for some @xmath23 , which explains the unboundedness in the range @xmath27 in the examples just mentioned .    on @xmath24 ,",
    "it is a classical result in harmonic analysis that the riesz transform is bounded on @xmath9 for all @xmath28 . in this case , the kernel of the riesz transform is given by @xmath29 ( we shall use @xmath30 for a euclidean coordinate throughout this paper , while the prime denotes the ` right variable ' of a kernel @xmath31 ; also , @xmath32 denotes @xmath33 and we write @xmath34 for @xmath35 . ) it is useful to compactify @xmath24 to a compact manifold with boundary @xmath36 by adding a sphere at infinity , and using @xmath37 as a boundary defining function and @xmath38 . ] for it . if we consider this kernel of @xmath39 near the ` right boundary ' of @xmath40 , namely @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , we see that it has an expansion given by @xmath43 the leading power in this expansion is @xmath44 and the coefficient multiplying it is @xmath13 .",
    "this kernel , by itself , is not bounded on @xmath9 for @xmath5 because the decay of the kernel puts it only in @xmath45 , @xmath46 , as a function of @xmath47 with @xmath30 fixed , so it can only be boundedly paired with elements in @xmath9 for @xmath48 .",
    "however , when we apply a @xmath30-derivative , the leading term is killed ( since @xmath49 ) and the kernel of @xmath15 decays at one order better , namely @xmath50 .",
    "this allows pairing with elements of @xmath9 for any @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a manifold with euclidean ends , and assume the number of ends is at least two .",
    "it is now relatively easy to explain why the riesz transform on @xmath0 is not bounded for @xmath5 . for simplicity we shall assume here that @xmath0 has exactly two euclidean ends .",
    "let us compactify @xmath0 to a compact manifold @xmath52 in the analogous way to @xmath36 above .",
    "the boundary of @xmath52 is then the disjoint union of two @xmath53-spheres , which we shall denote @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out that the kernel of @xmath39 has a similar expansion at @xmath56 , of the form @xmath57 but it is no longer true that the leading term @xmath58 .",
    "rather , @xmath59 is the harmonic function on @xmath52 that equals @xmath13 on @xmath54 , and zero on @xmath55 . as a consequence , applying the derivative operator in the left variable @xmath30 does not make this leading term disappear , since @xmath60 .",
    "hence the kernel of @xmath15 only decays to order @xmath53 at the right boundary of @xmath61 , and therefore can only be paired boundedly with elements of @xmath9 for @xmath48 .    in this paper",
    "we shall prove    [ main ] let @xmath0 be a complete @xmath62 riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath63 which is the union of a compact part and a finite number of euclidean ends .",
    "then the riesz transform is bounded from @xmath64 to @xmath65 for @xmath4 , and is unbounded on @xmath9 for all other values of @xmath20 if the number of ends is at least two .",
    "our method is to analyze the kernel @xmath39 based on the formula @xmath66 since @xmath0 is a manifold which is conic at infinity , the laplacian @xmath17 on @xmath0 lies in the class of scattering differential operators @xcite and we can use methods from the scattering calculus to analyze the kernel of @xmath39 .",
    "we shall analyze the kernel of @xmath39 rather precisely and work out the leading term in the expansion at the right boundary . from this",
    ", it will be straightforward to analyze the kernel of @xmath15 and to prove the theorem .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly describe the scattering calculus in section  [ scatt ] . in sections",
    "[ para ]  [ rt ] we prove the theorem using the analysis of the resolvent of the laplacian on asymptotically conic spaces in @xcite as a model . we give some large time asymptotics on derivatives of the heat kernel on manifolds with euclidean ends in section  [ heat ] .",
    "in section  [ coh ] we change point of view and consider a much more general class of manifolds , namely complete manifolds @xmath0 of dimension @xmath11 satisfying the nash inequality and with a uniform upper bound @xmath12 on the volume of geodesic balls of radius @xmath67 . we _ assume _ that the riesz transform on @xmath0 is bounded on @xmath9 for some @xmath10 and give several geometric and topological consequences : a hodge - de rham interpretation of the @xmath9 cohomology of @xmath0 ( proposition  [ hdr ] ) , injectivity of the map from @xmath14 to @xmath9 cohomology ( lemma  [ inj ] ) and derive a contradiction if @xmath7 and @xmath0 has at least two ends ( corollary  [ nb ] ) , thus generalizing the unboundedness part of theorem  [ main ] for @xmath7 to this larger class of manifolds . in the final section",
    "we discuss our results in the context of previously known examples and pose some open problems .",
    "as noted above , we shall use the scattering calculus @xcite to analyze the kernel of @xmath39 on manifolds with several euclidean ends .",
    "the scattering calculus is expressed in terms of compactifications on @xmath0 and , especially , of the double space @xmath68 which carries the kernel of the resolvent and of the operator @xmath39 .",
    "the space @xmath0 is compactified by adding a sphere at infinity @xmath69 for each euclidean end , and declaring @xmath70 and @xmath71 to be local coordinates near a boundary point ; in particular , @xmath72 is taken to be a defining function for the boundary ( which we shall sometimes refer to as ` infinity ' ) .",
    "we sometimes use @xmath73 to denote this boundary defining function and @xmath74 to denote boundary coordinates , extending to a collar neighbourhood of the boundary , as is customary when using the scattering calculus .",
    "the metric takes the form @xmath75 at each end , and is therefore a _ scattering metric _ as defined in @xcite ( of a particularly simple form , being an exact conic metric near infinity ) .",
    "we are mostly interested in the case when the number of ends is at least two .",
    "in fact , for the sake of clear exposition we shall assume from now on that the number of ends is exactly two , although all proofs in this paper generalize in an obvious way to any finite number of ends .",
    "we shall label these ends @xmath76 and @xmath77 , thus for example we shall use @xmath78 as the euclidean variable on the positive end , and @xmath79 for the variable on the negative end ; when it is not necessary to stipulate which end is being considered , we shall just use @xmath30 .",
    "it is not so obvious which compactification of @xmath68 is most appropriate for dealing with the schwartz kernels of operators such as the laplacian , or functions of the laplacian , on manifolds with euclidean ends .",
    "there are several different asymptotic regimes of interest when dealing with such kernels .",
    "one regime , the ` near - diagonal ' regime , is when the two variables @xmath80 remain a finite distance apart as they both go to infinity .",
    "another is when they both go to infinity with the ratio @xmath81 approaching a limit and with @xmath82 both approaching a limit .",
    "finally there is the case that one variable approaches a limit , while the other remains fixed .",
    "the kernel has different behaviour in each of these asymptotic regimes , so they need to be represented by distinct parts of the boundary of the compactification .",
    "the space @xmath83 is thus too ` small ' a compactification of @xmath68 for our purposes , since it only has the third regime distinguished ; the first two are squashed into the corner .",
    "it turns out that there is a space denoted @xmath84 , the ` scattering double space ' , which satisfies these criteria .",
    "it is obtained by performing two blowups on @xmath68 .",
    "the first is blowing up the corner @xmath85 , creating the so - called b - double space , and the second is blowing up the boundary of the diagonal ( which lifts to the b - double space to be transverse to the boundary , hence this blowup is well - defined ) .",
    "each asymptotic regime is represented by a boundary hypersurface of @xmath84 .",
    "the first , ` near - diagonal ' regime is represented by the boundary hypersuface created by the second blowup , denoted @xmath86 for ` scattering face ' ; the second is represented by the boundary hypersurface created by the first blowup , denoted @xmath87 for ` b - face ' ( since it is present in the b - calculus ) and the third regime is represented by the two boundary hypersurfaces @xmath88 , @xmath56 of @xmath83 , denoted @xmath89 and @xmath90 for ` left boundary ' a nd ` right boundary ' .",
    "note that when @xmath0 has @xmath91 ends , then @xmath87 has @xmath92 components and @xmath86 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 each have @xmath91 components .",
    "the structure of @xmath86 and @xmath87 is as follows .",
    "each component of @xmath86 is naturally diffeomorphic to @xmath93 , and @xmath94 and @xmath32 are coordinates on the interior of each component of @xmath86 .",
    "each component of @xmath87 is naturally isomorphic to a blowup of the space @xmath95 $ ] , with coordinates @xmath96 ; the blowup is of the submanifold @xmath97 which corresponds to the boundary of the diagonal .",
    "the _ scattering calculus _ is an algebra of pseudodifferential operators on @xmath0 which is defined by the properties of their schwartz kernels .",
    "namely , @xmath98 is a scattering psuedodifferential operator of order @xmath99 on @xmath0 iff the kernel of @xmath98 , when lifted to @xmath84 , is conormal has a singularity at the diagonal characteristic of pseudodifferential operators of order @xmath100 , and this holds smoothly up to the boundary , in the sense that it could be extended across the boundary as a conormal distribution .",
    "see @xcite , section 18.2 , for the precise definition . ] of order @xmath100 at the diagonal of @xmath84 smoothly up to the boundary @xmath86 , is smooth elsewhere at @xmath86 , and is rapidly decreasing at @xmath87 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the resolvent of the laplacian @xmath101 is a scattering pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath102 on @xmath0 for @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , the structure of the resolvent on the spectrum , i.e. the kernel of @xmath104 for real @xmath105 , can also be described on @xmath84 , although here the kernel is no longer rapidly decreasing at @xmath87 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , rather it is a ` legendrian distribution ' @xcite .",
    "our approach is partly modelled on the analysis in this paper .",
    "however , we take advantage of the assumption here that @xmath0 has exact euclidean ends , which leads to great simplifications over the analysis of @xcite since we can exploit the well - known explicit formulae for the resolvent of the laplacian on @xmath24 and use these as ingredients for a parametrix of the resolvent kernel on @xmath0 , thereby avoiding the need to use legendrian distributions in this paper .",
    "_ notation .",
    "_ we write @xmath30 for a euclidean variable @xmath106 and write @xmath107 , while @xmath108 is used for @xmath37 , or , sometimes , where more convenient , for @xmath109 . for a manifold with corners",
    "@xmath110 , we write @xmath111 for the space of smooth functions which vanish to infinite order at the boundary of @xmath110 .",
    "we use notation @xmath112 $ ] to denote the blowup of @xmath110 at the submanifolds @xmath113 , @xmath114 ,  ( in that order ) .",
    "to analyze the operator @xmath39 we return to the formula .",
    "we first observe that the off - diagonal terms in the kernel of @xmath39 come from a neighbourhood of zero in the integral . indeed , let @xmath115 be a cutoff function equal to @xmath13 in a neighbhourhood of @xmath116 and equal to zero outside a compact set , and let @xmath117 .",
    "then we may insert the factor @xmath118 into the integral . with the factor @xmath119 inserted ,",
    "the integral gives a function @xmath120 of @xmath17 , @xmath121 or @xmath13 , where @xmath122 is easily checked to be a classical symbol of order @xmath123 . by the symbolic functional calculus",
    "@xcite , this term is a scattering pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath123 , hence @xmath124 is a scattering pseudodifferential operator of order zero .",
    "it is therefore bounded on @xmath9 for all @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "so we are reduced to studying @xmath125 , given by the integral with factor @xmath115 inserted .",
    "we shall write down a fairly explicit parametrix for @xmath126 for small @xmath91 . in doing so ,",
    "we need to consider the different asymptotics that this kernel takes when @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "indeed , on @xmath24 the kernel decays as @xmath129 for @xmath128 and @xmath130 for @xmath131 , as @xmath132 , which ( except when @xmath133 ) is a different rate .",
    "this can be encoded geometrically by blowing up at the boundary when @xmath131 .",
    "consider the space @xmath134 ; \\bfc \\times \\ { 0 \\ } ; { \\operatorname{lb}}\\times \\ { 0 \\ } ; { \\operatorname{rb}}\\times \\ { 0 \\ } ] .",

    "we shall denote the new boundary hypersurfaces corresponding to the three blowups by @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , according as they arise from the first , second or third blowups in respectively , and we shall denote @xmath143 by @xmath144 , for ` zero face ' .",

    "we first use results from @xcite to show that we can solve @xmath181 on @xmath0 .",
    "the laplacian on an asymptotically euclidean manifold @xmath0 may be written in the form @xmath182where @xmath183 is an elliptic b - differential operator on @xmath0 .",
    "a short computation shows that near infinity , @xmath183 takes the form @xmath184where @xmath185 is the standard laplacian on the @xmath186-sphere .",
    "this is a strictly positive operator , so @xmath183 is ` totally elliptic ' , and hence is fredholm acting between the b - sobolev spaces is the @xmath14-space with respect to the b - metric @xmath187 ; thus @xmath188 .",
    "also @xmath189 is the b - sobolev space of order @xmath190 , defined as the set of functions @xmath191 such that @xmath192 for all b - differential operators of order @xmath190 on @xmath0 ( near infinity , such operators take the f orm @xmath193 , with @xmath194 ) . ] @xmath195 .",
    "thus @xmath17 itself is fredholm acting between @xmath196 .",
    "also @xmath183 is self - adjoint with respect to the measure induced by @xmath197 , so its index is equal to zero , hence it is invertible if and only if its null space is trivial .",
    "this is therefore also true for @xmath198.it is also shown in @xcite , section 5.25 , that if @xmath199 , with @xmath200 in @xmath18 , then @xmath200 has an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath201 where @xmath202 is a spherical harmonic with eigenvalue @xmath203 .",
    "in particular , such a function tends to zero at infinity .",
    "it follows from this and from the maximum principle that there is no nontrivial solution to @xmath204 , with @xmath205 , because by @xmath200 would be a harmonic function tending to zero at infinity .",
    "hence we can solve @xmath181 , @xmath206 , where @xmath200 has an expansion .",
    "let @xmath200 be as in the previous paragraph .",

    ", we get a function @xmath207 which satisfies all conditions of the lemma .",
    "we now use this lemma to define a harmonic function on @xmath0 which will be key to the parametrix construction .",
    "we begin by choosing a smooth function @xmath247 which is equal to @xmath13 for @xmath165 large and is supported in @xmath248 . using this",
    "we define functions @xmath249 on @xmath0 , with @xmath249 supported on the @xmath250 end of @xmath0 , in the obvious way",
    ". then let @xmath251 be the function given by lemma  [ const ] from the function @xmath252 .",
    "it follows that @xmath253 moreover , @xmath254    we now define our parametrix . it is based on the resolvent kernel for @xmath24 , but there is a crucial additional term ( @xmath255 below ) which corrects the leading order coefficient of the kernel at the face @xmath142 ( see the discussion of this coefficient in the introduction ) . we now write @xmath249 to denote this function of the left variable o @xmath68 and @xmath256 denote this function of the right variable on @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath257 be a parametrix , modulo smoothing operators , for @xmath258 in the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "we may assume that it is localized sufficiently close to the diagonal .",
    "we recall that the resolvent of the laplacian on @xmath24 has the form . using this notation",
    "we define @xmath259",
    "in this section , we correct the parametrix to the exact resolvent .",
    "the main point is that we obtain complete information about the regularity of the kernel of the error term on @xmath138 , and therefore of the resolvent itself on this space .",
    "this allows us to determine the regularity of @xmath39 and @xmath260 and compute its behaviour to leading order at the boundary hypersurfaces of @xmath84 .    applying @xmath214 to our parametrix ( on the left ) , we get @xmath261 where this equation defines @xmath262",
    ". we may think of @xmath262 either as a kernel on @xmath138 or , by restricting to @xmath263 $ ] which is the interior of @xmath138 together with the interior of @xmath144 , a family of kernels parametrized by @xmath91 acting on functions on @xmath0 .    by construction ,",
    "the complete symbol of the diagonal singularity of @xmath264 is the inverse , modulo symbols of order @xmath265 , of the complete symbol of @xmath214 .",
    "thus @xmath262 is smooth at the diagonal .",
    "also , we see due to the properties of @xmath266 that @xmath262 vanishes to infinite order at @xmath267 , @xmath90 and @xmath141 . the crucial property of @xmath262 is the order of vanishing at @xmath142 . to calculate this",
    ", we need to determine the leading coefficient of the expansion of @xmath264 at @xmath142 .",
    "these terms come from @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "since @xmath270 at @xmath142 , we have @xmath271 ; note that @xmath272 vanishes on @xmath142 , while @xmath273 is finite in the interior of @xmath142 . hence @xmath274",
    "if we combine this with @xmath269 , then using we see that the leading coefficient becomes @xmath275 the leading term annihilated by the operator @xmath214 ( since @xmath276 is harmonic and @xmath116 at @xmath142 ) , so the error term @xmath262 is @xmath277 at @xmath142  an improvement of one order over what might be expected , and the main point of introducing the correction term @xmath269 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath278 note that both @xmath279 and @xmath280 are smooth on @xmath138 , the former function vanishing simply at @xmath281 and the latter vanishing simply at @xmath282 .",
    "thus implies that the kernel of @xmath262 is @xmath283 times a bounded function on @xmath138 .",
    "this implies that @xmath262 is hilbert - schmidt , uniformly for @xmath284 $ ] , hence compact for each @xmath284 $ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath285 has finite dimensional null space and cokernel of the same dimension on @xmath18 .",
    "we next show that we can modify our parametrix by the addition of a finite rank term so that the new error term is invertible for small @xmath91",
    ". the correction term will be @xmath286 where the @xmath287 , @xmath288 are in @xmath289 and independent of @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath290 maps into @xmath289 , the null space is contained in @xmath289 and hence is independent of the choice of @xmath291 .",
    "thus we choose @xmath288 to span the null space of @xmath285 , and we would like to choose @xmath287 so that @xmath292 span a space supplementary to the range of @xmath293 .",

    "one can attempt to enlarge the class of known examples synthetically , i.e. by creating further examples from known examples by performing various operations .",
    "our results may be seen as obstructions to the stability of the @xmath9 boundedness of the riesz transform under gluing for @xmath20 above the dimension .",
    "we only mention , without proof , one result along these lines .",
    "namely , if the riesz transform is bounded on @xmath9 on a complete riemannian manifold @xmath0 of infinite measure , and with ricci curvature bounded from below , then it is bounded on @xmath9 on @xmath607 for any compact @xmath608 .",
    "we also mention a conjecture on manifolds obtained by gluing several copies of a simply connected nilpotent lie group ( endowed with a left invariant metric ) . according to @xcite we know that the riesz transform is bounded for every @xmath20 on a simply connected nilpotent lie group .",
    "let @xmath609 be a simply connected nilpotent lie group of dimension @xmath502 ( endowed with a left invariant metric ) . according to @xcite we know that the riesz transform on @xmath609",
    "is bounded for every @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath610 be the homogeneous dimension of @xmath608 ; for instance we can set @xmath611 @xmath612 being a fixed point .",
    "let @xmath481 be a manifold obtained by gluing @xmath613 copies of @xmath609 .",
    "the manifold @xmath0 is diffeomorphic to the sphere with @xmath91 points removed . according to @xcite we know that on @xmath481 the riesz transform is bounded on @xmath9 for @xmath6141,2]$ ] .",
    "the argument of section  [ coh ] can be applied ( changing the @xmath11 appearing in analytic inequalities by the homogeneous dimension @xmath610 ) .",
    "then ( [ nb ] ) implies that the riesz transform is not bounded on @xmath9 for @xmath615 .",
    "we can moreover compute the @xmath9 cohomology of @xmath0 .",
    "the arguments of proposition 3.3 of @xcite are given for the @xmath14 cohomology of such @xmath0 but they can be easily modified for @xmath9 cohomology . we find that for @xmath6141,\\nu[$ ] , @xmath616 whereas for @xmath615 we find @xmath617 that is , the conclusion of lemma  [ inj ] is satisfied if and only if @xmath618 .",
    "this gives another proof of the fact that the riesz transform is not bounded on @xmath9 for @xmath615 .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to get results for differential forms .",
    "one can consider either @xmath620 or @xmath621 , where @xmath622 is the laplacian on forms and @xmath39 really means @xmath623 where @xmath624 and @xmath625 for @xmath626 ( this projects off the @xmath14 null space of @xmath17 , i.e. the @xmath14-cohomology , which is trivial in the case of @xmath429-forms when @xmath0 has infinite measure ) .",
