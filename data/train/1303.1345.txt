    "however , other direct dm detection experiments can so far mostly observe only very few candidate events and a large part ( @xmath10 40% to 60% ) of these events would be unrejected backgrounds @xcite .",
    "many theoretical scenarios have been proposed to find an explanation for reconciling all these results from different experiments with various target nuclei . among them , one of the mostly discussed and experimentally constrained frameworks is inelastic dark matter ( idm ) models @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of idm models is that the incident wimps scatter _ inelastically _ off target nuclei and then transit to a slightly heavier ( exciting ) state with a tiny mass ( energy ) splitting @xmath11 , while the elastic scattering channel is suppressed or forbidden . due to the kinematics of inelastic scattering ,",
    "the targets with heavier nuclei have greater sensitivities than those with lighter nuclei .",
    "this suggests that the signals reported by dama which utilises relatively heavy iodine nuclei may not be detected by other experiments with light target nuclei such as germanium and silicon .",

    "in this paper we study direct dark matter detection experiments for the inelastic wimp  nucleus scattering framework and develop model  independent methods for not only reconstructing the measured recoil energy spectrum , which can in turn be used for identifying the inelastic wimp scenarios , but also determining the wimp mass and the mass splitting .    at the beginning of this paper",
    ", we followed our earlier work @xcite to derive the formula for reconstructing the one  dimensional velocity distribution function of inelastic wimps .",
    "however , since for inelastic wimps , there are two unknown parameters : the ( degenerate ) mass @xmath13 and the tiny mass splitting @xmath11 , not only our formula for reconstructing @xmath21 , but also the method for determining the wimp mass introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , can not be used directly .",
    "hence , we turned to develop a new procedure for determining the wimp mass as well as the mass splitting model  independently .    for this aim",
    ", we introduced a two  parameter exponential ansatz for reconstructing the measured recoil energy spectrum as well as determining the characteristic energy corresponding to the threshold ( minimal required ) velocity of incident inelastic wimps , which can produce recoil energy at all . in this process , not only the additional fitting parameter for reconstructing the recoil energy spectrum is approximately proportional to the squared mass splitting , but also the characteristic energy is directly proportional to the mass splitting ( for a fixed , non  zero wimp mass ) .",
    "thus these two quantities could be good indicators for identifying inelastic wimp ",
    "nucleus scattering scenarios .",
    "our numerical simulations show that , not only for large ( @xmath10 a few tens kev ) but also for ( very ) small ( @xmath10 a few kev ) mass splittings , our model  independent reconstruction could in principle indeed identify the positivities of the additional fitting parameter and the characteristic energy of the recoil energy spectrum with a 3@xmath104 to 5@xmath104 confidence level up to a wimp mass of @xmath10 1 tev and a mass splitting of @xmath10 200 kev .    meanwhile , for analytically reconstructing the recoil energy spectrum , one has to assume that the minimal cut  off energy could be negligible and the maximal one is large enough . not only because this would still be a challenge for most currently running and next  generation experiments , the kinematic minimal and maximal cut ",
    "off energies would also limit the available ranges of the mass ( splitting ) , especially for the use of light target nuclei .",
    "therefore , we introduced in this paper a numerical iterative procedure for correcting the analytic estimations of the fitting parameters of the measure recoil energy spectrum .",
    "our simulations show that , basically this numerical correction could indeed offer better reconstructions with smaller statistical uncertainties .",
    "however , the statistical fluctuation due to the use of only a few tens events causes the divergency problem of the distribution of the characteristic energy . for larger mass splittings ( ) ,",
    "the analytic reconstructions seem to be more reliable ; the distributions of the reconstructed spectrum fitting parameters and the characteristic energy offered by the numerical iterative procedure could have a ( much ) longer tails in high ( and even low)value ranges .",
    "this problem would be worse for the use of light target nuclei ; results offered with heavy target nuclei could still be used as auxiliary .",
    "moreover , we considered several different target nuclei .",
    "it has been found that , once the mass splitting is small ( ) , all materials could identify inelastic wimp scattering pretty well . in practice , light target nuclei , e.g.  @xmath63 and @xmath64 ,",
    "could even work better , due to relatively higher values of the second fitting parameter and the characteristic energy of the reconstructed recoil spectrum .",
    "however , for larger mass splittings ( ) , limited by the kinematic minimal and maximal cut ",
    "off energies due to the galactic escape velocity of halo wimps , one would need heavy target nuclei , e.g.  @xmath92 and @xmath98 , for the identification of inelastic wimps .",
    "furthermore , for the reconstruction of the wimp mass with the target combination of @xmath63 and @xmath92 , our simulations show that , for mass splittings , one could in principle reconstruct the wimp mass in the range between and pretty precisely with a statistical uncertainty of ( for ) to a factor of ( ) . meanwhile , we found also that the wimp mass estimated with the median values of the reconstructed characteristic energy by using several data sets ( with the same target nuclei ) could indeed be ( much ) better than the median values of the wimp mass reconstructed with each single pair of data sets , especially for heavier input wimp masses ( ) .",
    "moreover , it has been found that , once the mass splitting is pretty light ( ) , by using the target combination of @xmath64 and @xmath98 , the strongly underestimated wimp mass in the high  mass range with the si ",
    "ge combination could be ( strongly ) alleviated with a much smaller statistical uncertainty ; the distribution of the reconstructed @xmath13 would also be more concentrated .    on the other hand , due to the limitation by the maximal kinematic cut  off energy and the required use of two ( one heavy and one light ) target nuclei",
    ", one could only reconstruct the mass splitting less than a few tens kev . nevertheless , in the reconstructable range",
    ", one could in principle always reconstruct the mass splitting pretty precisely with a deviation of ( analytically ) or even ( numerically ) and a statistical uncertainty of to ( analytically ) or to a factor of ( numerically ) up to a wimp mass of . whether and how to use this ( pretty ) precisely reconstructed mass splitting as a priorly determined parameter for further reconstructions of the mass as well as the one  dimensional velocity distribution of inelastic wimps will be investigated in the future .",
    "finally , we consider the special case of the zero mass splitting ( elastic wimp  nucleus scattering ) .",
    "it has been found that , firstly , for this special case the numerical iterative procedure could offer an estimation of ( almost ) zero of the characteristic energy of the recoil spectrum .",
    "in addition , the detailed analysis of the distributions of the reconstructed results shows that , although the median values of the ( numerically ) reconstructed characteristic energies would be a little bit non  zero , the most frequently observable values could however be negligibly small ! secondly , although the reconstructed characteristic energy as well as the reconstructed mass splitting would be a little bit non  zero ( positive ) , one would observe simultaneously non  physically a negative reconstructed wimp mass ; the larger the true ( input ) wimp mass , the larger the absolute value of the reconstructed one .",
    "this unique observation could in turn help us to confirm or rule out the inelastic wimp ",
    "nucleus scattering scenarios down to a ( very ) small mass splitting ( ) .",
    "moreover , we would like to emphasize that our model  independent ( analytic and numerical ) reconstructions of the recoil spectrum as well as the estimations of @xmath14 could give clearly different results between the inelastic scattering case of a small , but non  zero mass splitting and the elastic one .    in summary , as complementarity and extension of our earlier work on the development of ( model  independent )",

    "nucleus scattering as well as for reconstructing the mass and the mass splitting of inelastic wimps simultaneously and separately .",

    "could even be reconstructed . as mentioned in introduction , several experimental collaborations announced recently their positive observations of dm / wimp signals .",
    "although so far either the numbers of recorded events are too few ( e.g.  only three candidate events were observed in the cdms si detectors @xcite ) or the estimated background fractions are still too high ( e.g.  @xmath10 50% in the cresst - ii experiment @xcite ) or even both , with increased numbers of cumulated ( candidate ) wimp events and continuously ( strongly ) reduced background levels ( e.g.  the lux experiment @xcite ) we could hope that in the near future our methods presented here ( combined probably with other approaches ) could help our experimental colleagues to not only distinguish different frameworks of dm / particle physics , but also further constrain the parameter space in ( various ) extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
