    "the possible observation of ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr s ) events with primary energies above @xmath0ev @xcite constitute one of the most intriguing puzzles in astroparticle physics ( see , for example , @xcite ) , although their origin and composition are not yet understood .",
    "the usual bottom - up scenarios in which particles should be accelerated by astrophysical objects do not seem to provide a convincing solution to the puzzle .",
    "the arrival direction of the primary particles should point to their sources because at such energies the intergalactic magnetic field does not deviate their direction of propagation .",
    "however , the clustering of uhecr events observed in the available data is not statistically significant and therefore there is no evidence that they arise from point sources @xcite .",
    "in addition , it would be necessary to overestimate several parameters of such sources and their acceleration regions in order to reach , marginally , the required energies @xcite .",
    "the problem concerning cosmic ray sources is related to the necessity that they must be located in our neighborhood , since particles propagating at high energies suffer a rapid degradation of their energy . for protons or nuclei as primaries , interactions with the cosmic microwave background should cause a loss of their energy due to photopion production .",
    "such an effect should result in a discontinuity in the cosmic ray spectrum for energies above @xmath1 ev , the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin  ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite .",
    "if the auger observatory data confirms that this feature is not observed , it can be shown @xcite that protons must have travelled less than @xmath2 mpc ( attenuation length ) in order to arrive at earth with energies larger than @xmath3 ev .",
    "the attenuation length for photons depends on their initial energy and it is less than 100 mpc for energies between @xmath4 ev to @xmath5 ev @xcite .",
    "since neutrinos have a very small cross section with nucleons within the standard model , it seems difficult that they could produce air showers in our atmosphere unless they had a yet unknown interaction @xcite .",
    "in order to overcome such difficulties , another class of models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the primary particle would not acquire kinetic energy continuously inside an accelerating region ( `` bottom - up '' mechanism ) as initially thought .",
    "instead , the highly energetic cosmic rays would be originated by the decay products of superheavy particles of cosmological origin ( `` top down '' mechanism ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider that such particles have masses close to the gut scale and would decay into known particles , as quarks and leptons that evolve following the qcd model @xcite .",
    "the quarks hadronize producing a small fraction of nucleons and pions that in their turn decay into photons , neutrinos and electrons and their corresponding antiparticles .",
    "therefore , from the decay of such a supermassive particle it is possible to produce energetic photons , neutrinos and leptons , together with a small percentage of nucleons . depending on which kind of particle is the primary , different attenuation lenghts can be obtained , so that one can establish at what minimum distances the supermassive particles sources should be located .",
    "there are different exotic candidates to play the main role in top - down scenarios , such as decaying topological defects @xcite or evaporating primordial black holes @xcite .",
    "the simplest top down models ( at least from the particle physics point of view ) involve supermassive metastable particles sometimes called wimpzilla s @xcite . due to their colossal masses ,",
    "such particles were presumably produced during the post - inflationary epoch and could contribute to a part or to the whole of the dark matter that accounts for about 30% of the energy density of the universe . in order to explain the theoretically estimated uhecr s fluxes @xcite , such particles must be decaying now and have to be located in our neighborhood , which is expected , assuming they are concentrated in our galactic halo .    in this work",
    "we study the possibility of producing wimpzillas in the post - inflationary process called instant preheating , suggested by felder , kofman and linde ( fkl ) , originally proposed as an alternative preheating mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this process seems to be essential for particle production in models of quintessential inflation @xcite .    in such a scenario ,",
    "scalar particles @xmath6 are non - perturbatively produced from the coherent oscillations of the inflaton @xmath7 , have their masses `` boosted '' due to their coupling to the field @xmath7 , and subsequently decay into supermassive metastable fermions @xmath8 .",
    "the idea of examining stable supermassive particles in this context was addressed by felder _",
    ", but its consequences either as dark matter or as cosmic rays primaries were not calculated in detail .",
    "more specifically , there is a relation between the density parameter of these particles and their lifetime .",
    "if @xmath8-particles compose the whole of the dark matter ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , a maximum lifetime limit will be found . on the other hand ,",
    "a lower limit on the abundance of such particles can be obtained if lifetimes are constrained to be larger than the age of the universe ( @xmath10 yr ) @xcite .",
    "as will be shown later , such limits impose severe constraints on the parameters of the fkl mechanism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we review some features of the nonperturbative processes more directly related to the production of massive scalar particles . in section",
    "iii we perform a detailed calculation of superheavy @xmath8 particle production , extending the previous results in @xcite . in section",
    "iv we discuss our main results for produced particles considered as dark matter in our current universe and present the parameter space for this model , which is in accordance with cosmological data . in the last section we present a summary of our main results and discuss their consequences .",
    "after inflation , matter had to be ( re)created , since the universe became empty . in the case of chaotic inflation , the scenario considered here @xcite , particle production may occur during the quasiperiodic evolution phase of the inflaton field .",
    "to study such a period we assume the lagrangian : @xmath11 the inflaton field @xmath7 produces quantum scalars bosons @xmath6 with bare masses @xmath12 through the interaction term @xmath13 . for simplicity",
    ", we will limit our analises to the quadratic potential @xmath14 ( the simplest chaotic inflation model ) with @xmath15 , as required by microwave background anisotropy measurements .    during inflation",
    "we can neglect the contribution of the @xmath6 field and the equation of motion for the @xmath7 field is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter and obeys the friedmann equation : @xmath18    as far as the slow roll conditions are valid ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 ) , the universe is in an inflationary phase . right after inflation ,",
    "the @xmath7 field oscillates about the minimum of its potential , with decreasing amplitude due to the damping term @xmath22 , and the solution of the above equation becomes : @xmath23    the @xmath7 field may produce @xmath6-particles during this oscillating phase due to nonperturbative effects @xcite , provided the coupling constants have appropriate values .",
    "as @xmath6 particles are bosons , such a process may lead to an explosive particle production through parametric resonance of the @xmath6 field @xcite . to illustrate this behavior",
    ", we consider the quantum nature of @xmath6 @xmath24 where @xmath25 e @xmath26 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath27modes of the @xmath6 eigenfunctions are given by : @xmath28 rewriting the above equation in terms of a more convenient variable @xmath29 , we obtain : @xmath30 where we used the fact that , for the quadratic chaotic potential , the inflaton coherent oscillations redshift as nonrelativistic matter . note",
    "that this is an oscillator equation with a variable frequency @xmath31 the effective mass of @xmath6 is defined as @xmath32 depending on the values of the parameters , the time variation of @xmath33 will not be adiabatic .",
    "the loss of adiabaticity takes place when @xmath7 field passes through the minimum of its potential , the region where @xmath34 changes more rapidly .",
    "in such a case , there will be an inequivalence between the @xmath35 vacua defined before and after the passage of the inflaton through the minimum , which can be interpreted as production of @xmath6 particles @xcite .",
    "this particle production process has been considered mainly for preheating proposals , since it happens before the usual perturbative reheating .",
    "alternatively , such a coupling between @xmath7 and @xmath6 can be used in models with production of heavy metastable particles in the early universe . in such a case",
    ", the produced particles may have masses larger than the inflaton mass @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we work on the latter approach and consider @xmath36 and @xmath12 as free parameters to be estimated from the available cosmological data .",
    "felder _ et al._@xmath37 noticed that the preheating could be efficient even in a single @xmath7 field oscillation if the @xmath6 particles produced at the minimum of @xmath38 were allowed to decay perturbatively into @xmath8 fermions when @xmath7 reached the maximum of its potential energy .",
    "the decay of such fermions into other particles and their subsequent thermalization could complete the reheating process without the necessity of parametric resonance .",
    "the authors also suggested the possibility of using such a mechanism to produce heavy particles in order to explain cosmic rays with energies above the gzk cutoff in a top - down approach .",
    "here , we perform explicit calculations following such a suggestion by assuming that @xmath8 particles are produced non - relativisticaly . in this way",
    "the energy transfer process from the inflaton field is more efficient , since only a very  fat \" @xmath6 particle can decay into @xmath8 particles .",
    "the whole process can be schematically represented as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coupling constant of a yukawa interaction @xmath41 added to the lagrangian eq.([lagrangian ] ) to account for the interaction between @xmath8 and @xmath6 .    from the yukawa interaction term ,",
    "the decay rate of @xmath6 bosons into @xmath8 fermions is @xmath42^{3 \\over 2}. \\label{gama}\\ ] ] note that the above rate is not constant , since @xmath43 defined by ( [ efetiva ] ) is time - dependent , and @xmath6 particles tend to decay at large values of @xmath44 .",
    "this is the most interesting feature of the model : a great amount of energy can be transfered from @xmath7 to the stable fermions because the bosons @xmath6 decay when their variable masses are at a maximum value .",
    "it is possible to obtain a relation between the couplings @xmath36 and @xmath40 if we take the interval @xmath45 around the maximum value of @xmath7 evolution for which @xmath43 is large enough to allow the decay of @xmath6 particles into nonrelativistic @xmath8 fermions . denoting by @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath47 the number densities of @xmath6 before and after the passage of @xmath7 through the local minimum of @xmath48 , repectively , we have that @xmath49 it is convenient to work with a more intuitive time variable , i.e. the number of oscillations @xmath50 of @xmath7 .",
    "in such a case , the solution ( [ sol.phi-pre ] ) for @xmath7 becomes @xmath51 this is a good parametrization from @xmath52 and later if we fix @xmath53 to be the instant when the inflaton field crosses the minimum of its potential for the first time .",
    "we will consider that the maximum momentum of @xmath8 particle to be its mass , that is , @xmath54 .",
    "the maximum available energy for the creation of a @xmath8 pair is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the amplitude of @xmath57 .",
    "this determines the largest interval @xmath58 around the maximum amplitude of the @xmath7 field , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , for which @xmath61 is large enough to allow a pair creation .",
    "such an interval is found to be @xmath62 .",
    "additionally , we require that approximately 90% of the @xmath6 particles decay during this interval . from eq .",
    "( [ taxa - t ] ) we obtain , @xmath63 with @xmath57 given by ( [ sol.phi-preii ] ) . solving numerically the above integral , we obtain that @xmath64 this upper limit is almost one order of magnitude larger than the felder _ et al _ estimate @xcite ( @xmath65 ) , since they did not consider the phase space factor in the expression for the decay rate ( [ gama ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the only arbitrariness in our assumptions is the fraction of remaining @xmath6 particles ( 90% ) , but for reasonable choices ( say @xmath66 between 1/2 and 1/100 ) the constraints on @xmath36 and @xmath40 do not vary appreciably .",
    "all the other constraints are consequences of the assumption of a maximum momentum @xmath54 so that @xmath8 may be considered as non - relativistic",
    ". naturally , the limits on @xmath67 would be even tighter if we had considered values for larger momenta .",
    "therefore , we are being conservative in our estimates",
    ". we also verified that although one should assume the time dependence of the decay rate on the above calculations , it does not bring any important difference if compared to the estimate found in @xcite where a constant decay rate , @xmath68 , was used .",
    "this seems reasonable , since the integration interval for @xmath69 is taken to be around the maximum of @xmath57 where the sine function does not vary significantly .",
    "such care would be necessary if we were studying the production of relativistic particles .    independently of the calculation details ,",
    "our main goal in this work is to find the largest possible region of the parameter space of the fkl mechanism that is phenomenologically allowed by the available data . assuming that the @xmath8 fermions are the metastable massive particles that we are looking for , we need to evaluate their present abundance supposing that they contribute to the energy density of the dark matter today . since for each decaying @xmath6",
    "a @xmath70 pair is created , we have to find the number density @xmath71 of the @xmath6 bosons for each oscillation of the inflaton .",
    "for the first oscillation , @xmath71 can be calculated from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq.movimento-x ] ) about the minimum of @xmath48 , so that the total number of @xmath6-particles @xcite is @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the field velocity near the minimum of the potential .",
    "the model describes the above production of @xmath6 particles , the boosting of their masses and their subsequent decay into @xmath8 wimpzillas with masses @xmath74    in order to verify that most of the @xmath8 particles will be produced in the first oscillation of @xmath7 , we compare the number density of produced @xmath6 particles in the second passage by the minimum of the @xmath7 potential , @xmath75 , to the first one , @xmath76 . by taking into account the dilution of @xmath76 due to the universe expansion between the consecutive passages",
    ", it is found that ( for details see the appendix ) @xmath77 therefore , the exponential term could provide the desired suppression between the two first passages .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the ratio between two consecutive passages tends to a constant prefactor multiplying the exponential , and , as long as the suppression is assured , particle production will be negligible for all subsequent oscillations .",
    "we will see in the next section that such suppression is verified , since for typical values of the parameters , say , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 and hence it is reasonable to consider only the first passage in our calculations .",
    "if the @xmath8 particles are the superheavy relics that decay into the observed uhecr s , we can use the presumed cosmic ray flux associated to their decays @xcite in order to estimate limits on the parameters of the model discussed above .    by accounting for the dilution of @xmath8 particles since their production until today",
    ", one may find the associate density parameter @xmath81 . in order to obtain an expression for this parameter",
    ", we have to consider three different moments in the history of the universe : the production of @xmath8 particles ( @xmath82 ) , the end of the reheating period ( @xmath83 ) and today ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we can then write : @xmath85 where we assumed thermal equilibrum for the relativistic components and the fact that @xmath86 .",
    "on the other hand we can suppose that the universe will be reheated from an instant convertion of the remanescent inflaton density energy into relativistic particles , so that @xmath87 where the last equality is obtained by considering that the @xmath8 and @xmath7 field coherent oscillations redshift as non relativistic matter .",
    "note that we are supposing that only the @xmath8 particle production in the first passage is important ( see expression ( [ n2-n1 ] ) ) .",
    "finally we can substitute @xmath88 into ( [ ratio - rho ] ) so that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the present cmb temperature , @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the current radiation density parameter .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath93 and , given that @xmath94 and for nonrelativistic fermions @xmath95 , we find that @xmath96 , where @xmath71 is given by equation ( [ tot.part.number.ip ] ) . choosing @xmath97 gev , the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath98    if @xmath8 wimpzillas are required to explain uhecr s , it is possible to obtain a relation between their abundance ( @xmath99 ) , their masses ( @xmath100 ) , the lifetime of @xmath8 ( @xmath101 ) and the uhecr s fluxes ( for details see references @xcite ) . as we mentioned earlier , in order to obtain such relations it is necessary to adopt a model in which particles are produced from the @xmath8 decay .",
    "this topic is an issue by itself , and we will follow the usual assumption of extrapolating qcd mechanisms valid in the the quark - hadron fragmentation process for the higher energies considered here . as we will show later on , the use of a specific value for the flux will not alter the region of the allowed parameter space appreciably .",
    "such a choice implies that photons dominate the primary spectrum by a factor of @xmath102 over protons @xcite .",
    "this means that , if we consider the observable ultra high energy cosmic ray fluxes as due to extremely energetic photons resulting from the decay of @xmath8 particles , we can write : @xmath103 where @xmath104 measures the clustering of @xmath8 particles inside the galactic halo .",
    "it is taken as 1 for a uniform distribution of superheavy wimp s , but can be considered as approximately @xmath105 if they are concentrated in galactic halos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will assume the latter case in what follows , i.e. @xmath106 , so that following limits on the parameters of the model can be established :    @xmath107 if they constitute the whole of the dark matter ( for @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) @xcite ) @xmath110    @xmath107 if they have a lifetime of the order of the age of the universe @xmath111 therefore , the @xmath8 abundance obeys the limits @xmath112 .",
    "this imposes constraints on the @xmath6 bare mass according to ( [ omega - psi ] ) : @xmath113 such conditions define a parameter space which is convenient to assess the phenomenological viability of the fkl mechanism as a generator of @xmath8 non relativistic wimpzillas .",
    "this is possible because the number density of @xmath6 produced in the post - inflationary era depends on @xmath36 and @xmath12 and is related to @xmath114 , so that limits on @xmath99 today restrict the possible values of such parameters .",
    "the analyses is summarized in figure 1 , which can be understood as follows .",
    "the upper and lower limits of the gray area come from the substitution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : upper ] ) and ( [ eq : lower ] ) in ( [ omega - psi ] )",
    ". we also have imposed unitarity constraints on eq .",
    "( [ limite ] ) ( @xmath36 and @xmath115 ) , so that @xmath116 ( which comprises the upper right triangle in the figure ) and obtained the limits to the left ( the minimum value for @xmath36 given the maximum possible value for @xmath40 ) and to the right ( the maximum value for @xmath36 ) in the allowed ( dark gray ) area in the figure . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also included the same analysis for the original fkl result , which corresponds to the right triangle limited by the dot - dashed line and to the widened area including the light gray region .",
    "= 3.5 in    we see that the allowed region in the parameter space is rather constrained .",
    "particularly , given the valid range for @xmath36 , we find very high masses for @xmath8 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpsi ] ) the minimum @xmath8 mass that can be obtained through this model is @xmath117gev ( the upper limit being @xmath118gev .",
    "this happens because the exponential suppression of the number density of @xmath6 particles created after the first @xmath7 field half oscillation , necessary to avoid parametric resonance ( see eq .",
    "( [ n2-n1 ] ) ) , is also present in the expression for @xmath99 ( see eq .",
    "( [ omega - psi ] ) ) .",
    "although the upper cosmological limit is quite strong given the most recent measurements , one may consider as a weak constraint the second astrophysical cosmic ray limit , as it is model dependent .",
    "however , even if we consider other classes of models to establish new lower limits on @xmath99 the above results would not change significantly , because the parameters of the model are not very sensitive to variations on @xmath99 .",
    "let us assume , for the sake of a comparison , an hypothetical value for the present @xmath8 abundance , say @xmath119 , so that the allowed region of the fig . 1 is enlarged .",
    "the resulting parameter space is depicted in figure 2 .",
    "= 3.5 in    for the same reason , wide variations of the reheating temperature in eq .",
    "( [ abundance1 ] ) will not change the picture .",
    "for example , one would have to consider reheating temperatures about 20 orders of magnitude higher than the one assumed here to obtain a shift of only one order of magnitude on the allowed range of @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the resulting allowed area of the parameter space is relatively independent of particle physics details of the reheating and of the hypothetical top - down decay of @xmath8 particles in uhecr s .",
    "we studied how to generate supermassive fermions that can explain the uhecr s in the context of a particle production mechanism suggested in ref .",
    "we obtained the parameter space for which such a mechanism can take place and concluded that some fine tuning of parameters seems to be necessary .",
    "additionally , the lower limit on the @xmath8 mass obtained , @xmath121 gev , is rather robust .",
    "a typical signature of this model would be an unforeseen rise in the flux at the highest energies end of the cosmic ray spectrum , which could be observed by the next generation of experiments , like the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the cosmic ray spectrum must have a cutoff which is associated to the maximum energy possible to uhecr s and is independent of the gzk feature .",
    "if such a cutoff happen to be below @xmath122 gev , this simplest version of the fkl mechanism should be discarded . on the other hand , it is this mechanism that can provide masses of such magnitude more naturally than any other top - down versions , so that if it is at all possible to measure such high energy cosmic rays and no cutoff in the uhecr s spectrum is observed by the next generation experiments , this model can become an attractive candidate .",
    "it is also interesting that , despite having perhaps too many free parameters , this model is rather constrained , and such a result is relatively insensitive to wide variations of the relevant cosmological parameters .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we studied the production of non relativistic @xmath8 particles only , and the scenario can be made more complex by considering the production of @xmath8 particles that are relativistic at the preheating time but becomes non - relativistic along the universe evolution . in this case",
    ", the energy transfer from the inflaton field to other fields may be not very efficient and it would be necessary to consider the dilution / concentration of @xmath8 particles throughout the several phases that happened since inflation ( coherent oscillations phase , radiation domination and matter domination ) and the allowed parameter space may be widened .",
    "the authors are grateful to hugo c. reis for useful discussions .",
    "we also benefitted from suggestions and comments from raul abramo , carlos o. escobar , alejandra kandus , gustavo medina - tanco and daniel muller .",
    "this work was supported by fapesp and cnpq .",
    "from ( [ sol.phi-preii ] ) , we can write the time derivative of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath69 : @xmath123 by labelling each time that @xmath7 passes through the minimum of its potential as @xmath124 we have that @xmath125 that is , @xmath126    from the general expression above , it is possible to obtain the ratio between the particle number density of @xmath6 particles produced in two consecutive bursts of @xmath6 generation so that we can evaluate the amount of suppression for each passage @xmath127 .",
    "writing the expression ( [ tot.part.number.ip ] ) for the total number density of @xmath6 particles produced in each passage in terms of the new definitions : @xmath128 since the @xmath129 along the coherent oscilations phase , we must compare the number density of particles produced at @xmath130 until @xmath131 by taking into account the dilution of @xmath132 at the @xmath133th passage : @xmath134 however , from ( [ n(phi ) ] ) , @xmath135 , so the ratio to be considered stands : @xmath136 by using the expression ( [ number - j ] ) in the above relation , we finally find : @xmath137 since @xmath6 particles decay into two @xmath8 s , the ratio above is also valid for @xmath8 particles .",
    "thus , we conclude that the exponential suppression , that has to be addressed in order to obey cosmological limits on the wimpzillas abundance ( see section iv ) , guarantees that we can consider in a good approximation only the @xmath6 particles produced in the first passage .      m.  nagano and a.  a.  watson , rev .",
