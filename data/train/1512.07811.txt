    "solar jets are ubiquitous plasma ejecta in the sun s atmosphere and are extensively observed in h@xmath14 @xcite , ca ii h @xcite , euv @xcite , and soft x - ray @xcite indicating their formation by the multi - temperature plasma @xcite .",
    "extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) coronal jets are either straight or curved , as well as inverted y - shaped plasma ejecta observed mostly in the transition region and corona at different temperatures .",
    "they may appear in the imaging observations as bright , dark , or dark - bright plasma structures as an emission or absorption features in various coronal / tr wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the intra - relationship of the jets at different emissions has been explored in great details , e.g. , in the h@xmath14 and soft x - ray @xcite , h@xmath14 and euv @xcite , and euv and soft x - ray @xcite emissions , which provides the clues on their exact driving mechanisms .",
    "the cool and hot component of the typical coronal jets have been physically explained by various magnetic reconnection based numerical models @xcite .",
    "@xcite have investigated in greater details the three ar jets simultaneously observed by _ hinode _ x - ray telescope and the _ transition region and coronal explorer _",
    "( _ trace _ ; @xcite ) and demonstrated that the euv and soft x - ray components of the coronal jet have similar ballistic speeds , life - time and spatial size . @xcite have observed an active - region jet using various spectral lines formed at different temperatures as observed by _ hinode_/eis .",
    "they have found simultaneous blue - shift ( upflows ) up to maximum speed of @xmath15  kms@xmath2 and red - shift ( downflows ) up to @xmath16  kms@xmath2 at the base of the coronal jet as observed by _ hinode_/eis .",
    "moreover , @xcite have observed a blue - shift of the active region jet plasma with the apparent velocity of @xmath1  kms@xmath2 and comparatively a weak red - shifted plasma motion at the base of the jet .",
    "@xcite have reported that the euv jet was co - spatial and consists of the similar kinematical features as of its soft x - ray counterpart .",
    "a similar conclusion has been drawn by @xcite who have presented simultaneous observations of three recurring jets in euv and soft x - ray emissions that occurred in an active region on 2007 june 5 .",
    "on comparing their morphological and kinematic characteristics in these two different wavelengths and related emissions , they found that euv and soft x - ray jets have co - spatial triggering site , similar direction , size , and propulsion speeds .",
    "@xcite have also analyzed jet s spectral properties by using multiple spectral lines as observed by _ hinode_/eis .",
    "they have found that these jets have temperature in the range of @xmath17 to @xmath18  mk , while maximum electron densities have been reported as @xmath19 to @xmath20  @xmath21 .",
    "for each of these observed jets , a blue - shifted component of the plasma and a red - shifted base are simultaneously observed .",
    "these observed jets as reported by @xcite have maximum doppler velocities ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23  kms@xmath2 for the blue - shifted plasma component , while it is observed in the range of @xmath24 to @xmath25  kms@xmath2 for the red - shifted plasma component .",
    "these observational results are found to be in agreement with the magnetic reconnection driven coronal jet models owing to the direct @xmath26 force @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented and discussed the multi - wavelength observations of five homologous recurrent euv solar jets triggered in noaa ar 11133 on december 11 , 2010 , which were observed by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) onboard the _ solar dynamic observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "the speed of these jets lie between @xmath27 and @xmath28  kms@xmath2 , and thhey are triggered in the direction of open field lines as shown by potential - field source - surface ( pfss ) extrapolations @xcite . @xcite",
    "have presented the evolution of four homologous helical recurrent jets triggered from noaa ar 11793 in the transition region and corona on july 21 , 2013 by using the aia/_sdo_. these jets have also been observed by the _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ ( iris ; @xcite ) and the doppler velocities in these jets have been estimated using the spectral data .",
    "they found that one edge of each of these jets was blue - shifted while the opposite edge was red - shifted simultaneously , which indicate that these jets have helical structure with the same sign of the helicity .",
    "magnetically structured euv coronal jets that we consider as moving cylindrical magnetic flux tubes likewise other solar flowing structures support the propagation of various kind of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves and oscillations . in the case when the tube plasma density is radially inhomogeneous along with the basic mhd waves , e.g. , slow magnetoacoustic , fast magnetoacoustic ( kink and sausage ) , and torsional alfvn waves , there appear so called continuous slow and alfvn spectra in the frequency domain where discrete global modes exist @xcite .",
    "rotation , sheared flow velocities and/or ambient magnetic fields as well as resistivity make the wave spectra much more complicated and difficult for analytical treatment .",
    "an excellent explanation of all the variety of mhd oscillations and waves in bounded cylindrical plasmas the reader can find in the books by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a useful review on the nonlinear mhd waves in the solar atmosphere and more specifically in the magnetically structured flux tubes was presented by @xcite .",
    "on contrary to the case when the solar atmospheric plasma is static and propagating modes are stable , the axial motion of flux tubes leads to a velocity jump at the tube surface that can result further into the evolution of a special kind of instability known as kelvin ",
    "helmholtz ( kh ) instability .",
    "the kh instability arises at the interface of two fluid layers that move with different speeds .",
    "flows are general uniform in both the layers , however , the strong velocity shear arises near the interface region of these two fluids forming a vortex sheet that becomes unstable to the spiral - like perturbations @xcite .",
    "when a magnetic flux tube moves along its axis then a vortex sheet is evolved near its boundary which may become unstable subjecting to the kh instability in a case when its axial speed exceeds some critical threshold value .",
    "this vortex sheet causes the conversion of the directed flow energy into the turbulent energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in exploring the kh instability in the solar atmosphere over the past decade arose from the circumstances that kh vortices were observed in solar prominences @xcite , in sweet ",
    "parker current sheets @xcite , in a coronal streamer @xcite , and at boundaries of rising coronal mass ejections @xcite , inspite of their existence in variety of astrophysical and geophysical plasmas also @xcite .",
    "all these observations stimulated the modeling of kh instability in moving magnetic flux tubes .",

    ", we study the kh instability in an active region ( ar ) euv jet observed with _",
    "hinode _ and detected by @xcite in the approximation of compressible plasma ( untwisted flux tube ) and incompressible plasma ( twisted flux tube ) . in the next section",
    "we specify the physical parameters of the jet , the topology of the magnetic fields inside and outside the moving flux tube modeling the jet and also discuss the wave dispersion equations for both geometries ( untwisted and twisted tubes , respectively ) .",
    "section 3 deals with the numerical solving mhd wave dispersion relations , and in sect .  4 we discuss the conditions under which the kh instability can develop in such moving structures .",
    "in the last section we summarize the main results obtained in this article .",
    "@xcite have presented a study of an ar jet observed by the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board _ hinode _ on 2007 january 15/16 ( west of noaa ar 10938 ) .",
    "eis covers two wavelength bands : @xmath29@xmath30    and @xmath31@xmath32   referred to as the short wavelength ( sw ) and long wavelength ( lw ) bands , respectively .",
    "the jet was observed at temperatures between @xmath33 and @xmath34 in log@xmath35 . in the ca xvii",

    "a strong blue - shifted component and the signature of a weak red - shifted plasma component at the base of the jet was observed around @xmath39 by @xcite .",
    "the up - flow velocities exceeded @xmath1  kms@xmath2 , which is very significant observation .",

    "the sound and alfvn speeds in both media are : @xmath58  kms@xmath2 , @xmath59  kms@xmath2 ( more exactly @xmath60  kms@xmath2 ) , and @xmath61  kms@xmath2 , @xmath62",
    "kms@xmath2 , respectively . we note that the magnetic field inside the jet is @xmath63  g that yields a ratio of both magnetic fields @xmath64 .",
    "the plasma betas in the jet and its environment are correspondingly @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we can , in principle , consider both media as incompressible plasmas .",
    "as we already said , the euv jet is modeled as a moving flux tube in two magnetic configuration : ( i ) as an untwisted tube with radius @xmath67 embedded in a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath68 and surrounded by coronal plasma immersed in the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath69 ( see the left column in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "our frame of reference is attached to the jet s environment , therefore the velocity of the moving magnetic flux tube , @xmath70 , has the meaning of a relative velocity if there is any ambient flow . in our cylindrical coordinate system @xmath71 ,",
    "the twisted magnetic field @xmath72 is characterized by the parameter @xmath73 , where both components are evaluated at the inner surface of the tube ( in the trivial case of untwisted tube we simply have @xmath74 and , hence , @xmath75 ) . in cylindrical equilibrium , the magnetic field @xmath68 and thermal pressure @xmath76 satisfy the equilibrium condition in the radial direction @xmath77 where , @xmath78 denotes the strength of the equilibrium magnetic field , and @xmath79 is the magnetic permeability .",

    ", we will treat the jet s plasma as incompressible medium and will assume a magnetic fields equilibrium with uniform twist , that is , the one for which @xmath80 is a constant .",
    "in such a case , the magnetic field inside the tube is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constant . for a magnetic flux tube with uniform twist",

    "the jet velocity is presented by @xmath88 , and the homogeneous ambient magnetic field is @xmath89 .",
    "dispersion relations of mhd waves propagating on cylindrical untwisted and twisted plasma jets are generally well - known and here we will only give their final form  their derivation the reader can see in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we recall that all perturbed quantities associated with the waves are proportional to @xmath90 $ ] , where @xmath91 is the wave angular frequency , @xmath7 the azimuthal wave mode number , and @xmath92 the axial wavenumber ( as usual , we assume that waves propagate in @xmath93 direction ) .",

    "the wave frequency is doppler - shifted .",

    "we will solve first eq .  ( [ eq : dispeq ] ) governing the wave propagation in an untwisted moving flux tube .",
    "the occurrence of the expected kh instability is determined primarily by the jet velocity and in searching for a critical or threshold value of it , we will gradually change velocity magnitude from zero to that critical value ( and beyond ) .",
    "thus , we have to solve the dispersion relation in complex variables , obtaining the real and imaginary parts of the wave frequency , or as is commonly accepted , of the wave phase velocity @xmath121 , as functions of @xmath92 at various values of the velocity shear between the euv jet and its environment , @xmath122 .",
    "we emphasize that for our piecewise uniform plasma density profile the singularities of the alfvnic continuous spectrum that would exist if the density were continuously varying are all concentrated in the point @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "note that this is true for all modes with @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , since we are interested in unstable mhd waves , they must be discrete modes ( see chap .  8 and fig .  8.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the normal modes propagating along a bounded homogeneous magnetized cylindrical plasma column can be pure surface waves , pseudosurface ( body ) waves , or leaky waves @xcite .",
    "the type of the wave crucially depends on the ordering of the basic speeds in both media ( the column and its surrounding plasma ) , more specifically sound and alfvn speeds as well as corresponding tube speeds . borrowing for a while cally s notation ( @xmath67 stands for internal alfvn speed , @xmath125 for external alfvn one , @xmath126 for internal sound speed , and @xmath127 for the external one )",
    "the speeds ordering in our case is @xmath128 after normalizing all velocities with respect to the external sound speed , @xmath127 , we obtain the dimensionless alfvn , sound , and tube speeds as follows : @xmath129 @xmath130 in calculating @xmath131 and @xmath132 we have used @xmath133  kms@xmath2 and @xmath134  kms@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "thus we have the following relations : @xmath135 now looking at table i in @xcite , we conclude that the kink ( @xmath6 ) mode must be a non - leaky pure surface mode of type s@xmath136 that implies an externally slow internally fast surface wave . by",

    "we note that the first inequalities chain in table i is wrong ",
    "the correct one is listed above .",
    "it is curious to see whether the numerical solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispeq ] ) will confirm these predictions .    before starting the numerical task",
    ", we have to normalize all variables and to specify the input parameters .",
    "our normalization differs from that of @xcite  we find more convenient the wave phase velocity , @xmath141 , and the other speeds to be normalized with respect to the alfvn speed inside the jet , @xmath142cally s normalization is inapplicable for the case when the surrounding plasma is considered as an incompressible medium .",
    "the wavelength , @xmath143 , is normalized to the tube radius , @xmath67 , that is equivalent to introducing a dimensionless wavenumber @xmath144 . for normalizing the alfvn speed in the ambient coronal plasma , @xmath145",
    ", we need the density contrast , @xmath146 , and the ratio of the magnetic fields @xmath147 , to get @xmath148 .",
    "the normalization of sound speeds in both media requires the specification of the reduced plasma betas , @xmath149 . in the dimensionless analysis the flow speed , @xmath150 , will be presented by the alfvn mach number @xmath105 .",
    "the input parameters for solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispeq ] ) are as follows : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ; during the calculations we will vary the alfvn mach number , @xmath155 , from zero ( static plasma ) to values at which we will obtain unstable solutions . among the various mhd modes propagating on a cylindrical static / moving magnetic flux tube of compressible plasma surrounded by also compressible medium",
    "the most interesting is the kink ( @xmath6 ) mode because , as previous studies @xcite show , namely the kink mode becomes unstable when the jet speed exceeds a critical value . at a static magnetic flux tube ( @xmath156 ) , the kink waves propagates with the kink speed , @xmath157 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinkspeed ] ) ) , which in our case is equal to @xmath158  kms@xmath2 , or in dimensionless units , @xmath159 , i.e. , the wave is slightly super - alfvnic one and @xmath141 lies between the internal and external alfvn speeds .",
    "this is not surprising because the kink speed ( [ eq : kinkspeed ] ) is not sensitive to the sound speed  that is why it is more natural @xmath138 in the inequalities chain in cally s @xcite table i to be replaced by @xmath160 .",
    "our numerical calculation confirm that @xmath161 . in cally s",
    "dimensionless variables our normalized kink speed of @xmath159 transforms into @xmath162 and we have @xmath163 along with @xmath164 , that is , in agreement with aforementioned predictions .",

    "kms@xmath2a speed , which is below the observationally evaluated jet speed of @xmath1  kms@xmath2 .",
    "it is important to underline that all the stable kink modes in our system are pure surface waves but the unstable ones are not  the latter become leaky waves ( their external attenuation coefficients , @xmath170s , are complex quantities with positive imaginary parts ) .",
    "this implies that wave energy is radiated outward in the surrounding medium .",
    "thus , the kh instability plays a dual role : once in its nonlinear stage the instability can trigger wave turbulence and simultaneously the propagating kh - wave is radiating its energy outside .",
    "the circumstance that the reduced plasma betas in both media are @xmath171 , tempts us to consider the moving get and its surrounding magnetized plasma as incompressible media .",

    "[ fig : fig5][fig : fig7 ] , those critical wavenumbers have values of @xmath200 trough @xmath201 to @xmath202 for the @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 mhd modes , respectively . if we assume that our euv jet has a width @xmath203  km , then the corresponding critical wavelengths for a kh instability onset are @xmath204  mm , @xmath205  mm , and @xmath206  mm , respectively .",
    "these critical wavelengths are of the order or less than the height of the euv gets ; for instance , @xcite observing three jets in the seven extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) filters of the aia/_sdo _ , have reported jets heights between @xmath207 and @xmath208  mm ; the arithmetic mean diameter of those euv jets was @xmath209  mm .",
    "one expects that the actual wavelengths of occurring kh instabilities of the higher @xmath7 modes should be shorter than the discussed critical wavelengths .",
    "we pay attention to the fact that the threshold alfvn mach numbers for observing kh instability in the @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath210 modes are very close , equal to @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 , respectively , and they yield critical flow velocities of @xmath214 , @xmath13 , and @xmath215  kms@xmath2 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that all studied mhd modes propagating on the euv jet in equal measure can become unstable against the kh instability ",
    "the required flow velocity shear lies between @xmath9 and @xmath12  kms@xmath2 .",
    "we note also that the phase velocities of unstable higher @xmath7 modes are in the range of @xmath216@xmath217  kms@xmath2 , while those of the kink , @xmath6 , mode lie between @xmath218 and @xmath219  kms@xmath2 in the case of untwisted jet , and between @xmath220 and @xmath221  kms@xmath2 for a weakly twisted euv jet .",
    "an evaluation of the instability growth rate requires the magnitude of the observed / detected wavelength ( or equivalently , the @xmath144-value ) and the jet width .",
    "for example , if we assume that the kh instability of the @xmath198 mhd harmonic rises ( see fig .  [ fig : fig6 ] ) at @xmath222 ( or with @xmath223  mm , assuming that @xmath224  mm ) , the corresponding normalized wave phase velocity growth rate is equal to @xmath225 that yields a wave growth rate @xmath226  s@xmath2 .",
    "such growth rates , of few inverse milliseconds , were evaluated for the kh instability of high harmonic mhd modes ( however , with negative signs of their azimuthal wave mode numbers ) in cool surges ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the wave phase velocity of the considered unstable @xmath198 mode ( see the bottom panel in fig .  [",

    "the question that immediately arises is how any change in physical parameters of the jet or its environment will influence the condition for kh instability occurrence .",

    "we obtain that the kink , @xmath6 , mode ( in both configurations ) and harmonic mhd modes in a twisted magnetic tube with @xmath189 can become unstable at flow speeds of @xmath237  kms@xmath2 ( at @xmath238 ) for the compressible untwisted tube , and @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242  kms@xmath2 correspondingly for the @xmath243 modes in the incompressible tube with also incompressible environment .",
    "as seen , all these critical speeds are still accessible for our euv jet .",
    "on the other hand , if we choose the background magnetic field to be equal to @xmath244  g ( at @xmath151 ) , that would imply that the reference alfvn speed will increase to @xmath245  kms@xmath2 , the critical jet speed for triggering a kh instability of the kink , @xmath6 , mode in an untwisted jet at @xmath246 will become equal to @xmath247  kms@xmath2a speed that is inaccessible for our euv jet .",
