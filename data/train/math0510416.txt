    "this structure determines a faithful representation from @xmath3 into @xmath4 which can be taken to have image in @xmath5 for some smallest number field @xmath6 , called the _ trace field _ of @xmath0 .",

    "this question seems to be wide open , and very few nontrivial relationships are known .    in this paper",
    "we show by an elementary geometric argument that when @xmath0 is a hyperbolic once - punctured torus bundle over @xmath1 , the trace field @xmath6 has no real places ( i.e. it is not galois conjugate to a subfield of @xmath7 ) .      in ",
    "2 we give an exposition of the relation between euler classes , stiefel - whitney classes , orientations , and boundary traces for hyperbolic surfaces and @xmath2-manifolds .",
    "all this material is classical , but it seems that there is no explicit and thorough account of it in the literature which takes our particular viewpoint .",
    "this discussion takes up more than half the length of the paper  we feel that its inclusion is justified by its potential interest as a reference for the @xmath2-manifold community .    note that some facts which might be otherwise somewhat obscure , are clarified by a thorough discussion of this foundational material .",
    "in particular , it is immediate from our viewpoint that for a hyperbolic knot complement @xmath0 , the trace of a longitude is @xmath8 , after lifting a geometric representation @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "in  3 we specialize to once - punctured torus bundles . after a preliminary discussion of trace fields and invariant trace fields , we prove our main theorem :    let @xmath11 be a hyperbolic oriented once - punctured torus bundle over @xmath1 with monodromy @xmath12 .",

    "most interesting is the observation that if @xmath0 contains a _ pseudo - rational surface _",
    " i.e. a surface @xmath15 with all traces rational  then such a surface has maximal euler class with respect to any @xmath16 representation .",
    "in particular , a @xmath2-manifold containing a pseudo - rational surface which is not thurston norm minimizing in its homology class ( e.g. it might be separating ) has a trace field with no real place .",
    "a nice corollary , pointed out by a. reid , is that this equality lets us construct examples of knot complements which contain no totally geodesic immersed surfaces , for example , the knot @xmath17 in rolfsen s tables .",
    "we also give an example showing that for every @xmath18 and every @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 there are incompressible surfaces @xmath22 with euler characteristic @xmath23 in some hyperbolic @xmath2-manifold @xmath0 with a real place @xmath24 for which @xmath25 .",
    "the milnor - wood inequality implies that @xmath20 is sharp , and the mod 2 condition is implied by the fact that the representations are galois conjugate into a geometric representation , so these are all the possibilities which can arise .",

    "if @xmath0 is a ( compact or noncompact ) hyperbolic surface bundle , and @xmath15 is any fiber , then the same argument shows that if @xmath6 has a real place @xmath222 , then @xmath243    j. button has studied trace fields of punctured torus bundles with monodromy of the form @xmath244 in @xcite .",

    "a theorem of gabai ( @xcite ) shows that these two norms are equal ( after a suitable normalization ) ; i.e. any immersed surface may be replaced by an embedded surface of no larger norm .",

    ".      one method of constructing ( pseudo)-rational surfaces is by covering thrice punctured spheres .",
    "a thrice - punctured sphere is always homologically essential , and therefore so is its preimage in a finite cover .",
    "but if such a finite cover has suitable symmetries , one might be able to find a ( low genus ) surface with a @xmath92-fold orientation - reversing fixed - point free symmetry , in the same homology class as the pseudo - rational surface .",
    "one can then cut along such a surface , and reglue the resulting boundary components to themselves to get a new manifold with the same trace field as the old , in which the pseudo - rational surface is homologically trivial .",
    "[ no_totally_geodesic ] let @xmath0 be a fibered knot complement in a rational homology sphere whose trace field @xmath6 has odd prime degree .",

    "since it is fibered , the rational homology is generated by the fiber @xmath273 .",
