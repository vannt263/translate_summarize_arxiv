    "coupled map lattices ( cmls ) , dynamical systems with discrete space and time , are being intensively investigated since the early 80 s as models of many spatiotemporal phenomena occurring in a wide variety of systems @xcite .",
    "one of such phenomena is synchronization and , in particular , amongst the various kinds of synchronized behavior , _ complete synchronization _ ( cs ) @xcite occurring in regular arrays of coupled chaotic systems .",
    "intermittency plays an important role in the destabilization of the synchronized state@xcite .",
    "intermittent transitions between laminar , quiescent states , and irregular bursting have been investigated in many dynamical systems , their scaling properties being determined@xcite .",
    "theoretical derivations of these scalings usually assume gaussian fluctuations for describing the irregular bursts between consecutive laminar regions .",
    "although this may be a suitable approximation for many systems , there are cases where deviations from gaussianity can be observed , specially in the vicinity of the synchronization threshold .",
    "it is our purpose to exhibit such anomalous behavior .",
    "let us consider , as paradigmatic example of a spatially extended system , periodic chains of @xmath1 one - dimensional chaotic maps @xmath2 evolving through a distance - dependent diffusive coupling : @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the state variable for the site @xmath5 @xmath6 at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the coupling strength , @xmath9 an arbitrary function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 a normalization factor , with @xmath12 for odd @xmath1 .",
    "cs takes place when the dynamical variables that define the state of each map adopt the same value for all the coupled maps at each time step @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "it can be easily verified that this state is solution of eq .",
    "( [ cml ] ) .",
    "the question is whether it is stable or not with respect to small perturbations in directions transversal to the cs state in cml phase space .",
    "a criterion for stability can be drawn from the asymptotic lyapunov spectrum ( ls ) . as far as the cs state lies along the direction associated to the largest exponent",
    ", the cs state will be transversely stable if the @xmath14 remaining exponents are negative .",
    "therefore , if there is a single attractor , negativity of the second largest lyapunov exponent implies that the cs state is asymptotically attained@xcite .",
    "depending thus on system size and on the parameters defining both the chaotic map and @xmath9 , there may exist an interval of values of the coupling strength @xmath15 for which the cs state is asymptotically stable .",
    "explicit results have been shown before , for instance , for algebraically decaying interactions , i.e. , @xmath16 , with @xmath17@xcite and for uniform interactions with a cut - off distance @xmath18 , with @xmath19@xcite . in those cases , for a given system size , one finds a _ synchronization domain _ in parameter space .    inside this domain , cs eventually occurs after a transient whose typical duration diverges as one approaches the critical frontier . outside the synchronization domain , there may occur intermittent behavior .",
    "a characterization of phenomena associated to a blowout bifurcation , such as intermittency@xcite , can be performed through the analysis of the distribution of largest transversal finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ltfes ) .",
    "we will show that for ulam maps coupled through schemes of the form ( [ cml ] ) , the probability density function ( pdf ) of ltfes deviates from a gaussian law .",
    "this will be shown to have important consequences at criticality .",
    "let us remark that analytical results are specially relevant in this field due to the very nature of the phenomena involved , sensitive to the unavoidable finite precision of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of tangent vectors @xmath20 @xmath21 is obtained by differentiation of the evolution equations ( [ cml ] ) . in order to obtain finite - time exponents , we proceed analogously to what we have done before for the calculation of asymptotic exponents @xcite . for self - containedness ,",
    "let us review the steps .",
    "the tangent dynamics is given by @xmath22 , where the jacobian matrix @xmath23 is @xmath24 with the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined , respectively , by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , being @xmath29 .",
    "once the initial conditions have been specified , the ls of finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftes ) @xmath30 , calculated over a time interval of length @xmath31 , is extracted from the evolution of the initial tangent vector @xmath32 : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . the ftes are obtained as @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the eigenvalues of @xmath38@xcite .    in cs states ,",
    "the dynamical variables of all maps coincide at each time step @xmath5 , i.e , @xmath39 . in this case , @xmath40 , thus , @xmath41 and @xmath42^{2 } ) \\hat{\\bf b}^{2i}$ ] .",
    "therefore , one arrives at the following expression for the spectrum of @xmath1 _ finite - time _",
    "lyapunov exponents , over a time interval of length @xmath31 , in _ cs states _ : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , the eigenvalues of the interaction matrix @xmath26 , are given by @xmath46 , for odd @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the @xmath5th iterate of the initial condition @xmath48 , the same for the @xmath1 maps , since we are dealing with cs states .    in the asymptotic case @xmath49 , and assuming ergodicity , the first term in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lambdak ] ) , which represents a time - average , can be substituted by an average over the single - map attractor .",
    "in such case one gets the asymptotic ls @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the lyapunov exponent of the uncoupled map .",
    "notice that the parameters that define the particular uncoupled map affect only @xmath52 , while @xmath53 are determined by the particular cyclic dependence on distance in the regular coupling scheme .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the asymptotic ls provides a criterion for synchronization , namely the negativity of second largest ( or largest transversal ) asymptotic exponent @xmath54 .",
    "for the particular interaction @xmath16 , that we will consider in numerical simulations , the above condition leads to@xcite @xmath55",
    "unlike infinite - time exponents , local exponents strongly depend on the initial conditions . starting from random initial conditions , the fluctuations in the values of @xmath56",
    "arise from the summation in ( [ lambdak ] ) only , since @xmath57 are constant . as a consequence ,",
    "all the @xmath56 of the spectrum will have a pdf with the same shape , differing only in the mean value @xmath58 , which coincides with the asymptotic exponent @xmath59 .",
    "in particular the variance of finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftes ) in the cs states does not depend on @xmath60 ( since it is an additive constant ) .",
    "therefore , it is the same for all the exponents of the spectrum , as expected also from the fact that the source of the fluctuations is unique . along a trajectory",
    ", fluctuations shift the finite - time lyapunov spectrum as a whole .",
    "a further consequence is that the variance of the local exponents in cs states does not depend on the lattice parameters embodied in @xmath57 , but only on the local features of the individual map .",
    "in fact , in cs states , all maps evolve with the dynamics of an uncoupled map .",
    "being so , the pdfs of ftes can be straightforwardly obtained from the pdf of the local map .",
    "hence , let us omit by the moment the index @xmath61 .",
    "our discussion will be valid for any @xmath56 , in particular for @xmath62 .    for the ulam map , @xmath63 , a smooth approximate expression for the pdf of ftes is available @xcite , namely @xmath64/2|})\\ , , \\",

    "therefore , in the latter interval , expression ( [ smooth ] ) constitutes a smooth approximation , such that the sharp spikes have been trimmed by finite size bins .",
    "moreover , the exact pdf is non - null only for @xmath68 .",

    "it is worth noting that , although expression ( [ smooth ] ) was derived for cs states , it remains still a good approximation even close outside the synchronization domain .",
    "this means that the correlations that lead to violation of the central limit theorem persist in that region .",
    "however , far enough from the threshold , the terms that contribute to ftes become uncorrelated by the `` bath '' of coupled chaotic maps , and the central limit theorem holds , leading to gaussian shapes ( see fig .  [ fig_distr ] ) . notice that the pdf for @xmath78 , although gaussian in the central part , stills falls at right with a exponential tail .",
    "a detailed analysis of correlations giving rise to ( [ smooth ] ) can be found in refs .",
    "basically , the autocorrelation function @xmath79 of one - step ftes is @xmath80 , that is , it decays exponentially with time @xmath31 ( with a characteristic time equal to the inverse of @xmath81 ) .",
    "however , since successive one - step exponents are dependent through the deterministic logistic mapping , non - gaussian pdfs of ftes arise .",
    "for parameter values belonging to the synchronization domain , that is , for subcritical @xmath74 , being all other parameters fixed , the system eventually converges to the cs state .",
    "in fact , asymptotically , cs states are stable since the distribution of ltfes collapses to a dirac delta function centered at @xmath54 , which is negative in that domain .",
    "the relaxation to a cs state can be measured , for instance , by means of either the distance to the sm , defined through @xmath82 , or the order parameter @xmath83 . since , for small deviations from the sm , both quantities are related through @xmath84 , we will exhibit the time evolution of @xmath85 only .",

    "as one follows a trajectory for a longer time interval , the pdf of ltfes concentrates around the mean .",
