    "nevertheless , it is said that this was one of fermi s favorite ideas and that he often used it later in life @xcite . in this publication ,",
    "fermi devised a method known as the _ equivalent ( or virtual ) photon method _"

    "<S> moving highly - charged ions carry strong electromagnetic fields that act as a field of photons . in collisions at large impact parameters , </S>",
    "<S> hadronic interactions are not possible , and the ions interact through photon - ion and photon - photon collisions known as _ ultra - peripheral collisions _ ( upc ) . </S>",
    "<S> hadron colliders like the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) produce photonuclear and two - photon interactions at luminosities and energies beyond that accessible elsewhere ; the lhc will reach a @xmath0 energy ten times that of the hadron - electron ring accelerator ( hera ) . </S>",
    "<S> reactions as diverse as the production of anti - hydrogen , photoproduction of the @xmath1 , transmutation of lead into bismuth and excitation of collective nuclear resonances have already been studied . at the lhc </S>",
