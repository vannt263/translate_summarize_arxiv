    "fsles provide a measure of dispersion as a function of the spatial resolution , serving to isolate the different regimes corresponding to different length scales of oceanic flows , as well as identifying the lcss present in the data . to calculate the fsles we have to know the trajectories of fluid particles , which are computed by integrating the equations of motion for which we need the velocity data @xmath5 .",
    "fsle are computed from @xmath6 , the time required for two particles of fluid ( one of them placed at @xmath7 ) to separate from an initial ( at time @xmath8 ) distance of @xmath9 to a final distance of @xmath10 , as :    @xmath11    in principle obtaining @xmath12 would imply to consider all the trajectories starting from points at distance @xmath9 from our basis point ; in practice , when confronted with regular , discretized grids , only the four closest neighbors are considered .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath9 to be the intergrid spacing among the points on which the fsles will be computed , i.e. , it is the resolution of the  fsle grid \" .",
    "the details of the calculation of the fsles are in appendix [ ap : fsle ] .",
    "notice that we distinguish two types of grids , namely the fsle grid ( in the following `` f - grid '' ) and that where the velocity field is given ( called velocity grid or `` v - grid '' ) .",
    "these two grids need not to coincide .",
    "we explore first the effect of changing the resolution of fsle grid .    in figure  [",
    "fig : fsle - gridres ] we show an example of the fsles derived using four different f - grids with increasing resolutions .",
    "visually , as the resolution of the f - grid is increased the structures already observed in the coarser version are kept , just increasing their detail level .",
    "in addition , when resolution is increased , new less active structures are appearing in areas previously regarded as almost inactive . taking a f - grid finer than the associated v - grid would make no sense if fsle was an eulerian measure obtained from single snapshots of the velocity field .",
    "but fsle is a lagrangian measure , i.e. they are computed using trajectories which integrate information on the _ history _ of the velocity field .",

    "the question naturally rises about the possible multifractal character of fsles .",
    "multifractality is a property characteristic to turbulent flows , and it is associated to the development of a complex hierarchy accross which energy is transmitted and utterly dissipated @xcite .",
    "the study of the scaling properties of the distribution of fsles at the different resolution scales reveal that they are multifractal ( see appendix [ ap : multi ] ) .",
    "this implies that changes in scale are accounted for by a well - defined transformation , namely a cascade multiplicative process @xcite .",
    "it also implies that information is hierarchized @xcite and so what is obtained first , at the coarsest scales , is the most relevant information .",
    "due to multifractality , small - scale structures , as unveiled by the fsles , with typical sizes smaller than that of the velocity resolution , are determined by the larger ones and the multi - scale invariance properties .",
    "thus , no artificiality is induced by this calculation and the robustness of fsle analysis under changes in scale is confirmed .    a different question concerns the robustness of fsles when the v - grid is changed .",
    "for instance , when a diagnosis is obtained with a low - resolution velocity field , is this diagnosis compatible with a later improved observation of the velocity ?",
    "the answer is yes . in figure  [ fig : fsle - velres ] we show the fsles obtained at a fixed f - grid resolution of @xmath19 for varying velocity resolutions ( namely , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "the change of resolution of the velocity grid is performed as indicated in appendix [ ap : resolution ] .",
    "we observe that the global features observed with the coarser resolution v - grid are kept when this is refined . obviously , as the velocity field",
    "is described with enhanced resolution new details ( with short - range effect on the flow structure and so no contradicting the large - scale picture ) become apparent in the fsles .",
    "however , the effect of refining the v - grid is not only introducing new small - scale structures : there is a consistent increase in the values of the fsles as the v - grid is refined .",
    "the histograms of the fsles , @xmath23 , for a given velocity resolution conditioned by the fsles , @xmath24 , obtained from a coarser velocity field are shown in figure  [ fig : condfsle - velres ] .",

    "the best linear regression fits are @xmath25 ( correlation coefficient , @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "according to these results , we can approximate the finer fsles @xmath23 in terms of the coarser fsles @xmath24 as :    @xmath28    where the quantity @xmath29 determines the contribution to the fsle by the small - scale variations in velocity not accounted for by the lower resolution version of this field .",
    "it is hence independent of @xmath24 , so the intercept of the vertical axis with the linear regression equals the mean of this quantity .     at different initial v - grid resolutions : a)@xmath30 , b ) @xmath31 , c ) @xmath32 . in all of them",

    "the disappearance of a land barrier or the creation of a new one as a consequence of the coarsening would imply a dramatic change in the value of fsles at all points affected by the modified circulation ; if the circulation patterns are rather complex almost every point could be affected .",
    "we have thus preferred to smooth the velocity with a convolution kernel weighted with a local normalization factor , and keeping the original resolution for the data so land barriers are equally well described than in the original data .",
    "we define the coarsening kernel of scale factor @xmath112 , @xmath113 , as :    @xmath114    we disregard the introduction of a normalization factor at this point since we will need to normalize locally later . the coarsened version of the velocity vector",
    "would hence be given by the convolution of this kernel with the velocity , denoted by @xmath115 .",
    "a coarsening convolution kernel turns out to be convenient with almost horizontal fields , as the derivatives commute with the convolution operator so if @xmath116 hence @xmath117 . however , this coarsening scheme needs to be improved . by convention",
    ", we take the velocity @xmath118 as zero over land points . for that reason",
    ", a simple convolution does not produce a correct coarsened version of the velocity because points close to land would experience a loss of energy .",
    "the easiest way to correct this is to normalize by the weight of the sea points .",
    "let us first define the sea mask @xmath119 as @xmath120 over the sea and @xmath35 over the land .",
    "the normalization weight is given by @xmath121 .",
    "for points very far from the land , this weight is just the normalization of @xmath113 . for points surrounded by land points",
    "the weight takes the contributions from sea points only .",
    "we thus define the coarsened version by a scale factor @xmath112 of the velocity , @xmath122 , as :    @xmath123    in figure  [ fig : velocityres ] we show two examples of coarsened velocities .",
    "we can see that typical circulation patterns are coarsened as @xmath112 increases , while land obstacles are preserved .",
    "in fact , if @xmath124 is the velocity resolution scale , the effective resolution scale of @xmath122 is @xmath125 ( the nominal resolution , on the contrary , is the original one , @xmath124 ) .",

    "<S> much of atmospheric and oceanic transport is associated with coherent structures . </S>",
    "<S> lagrangian methods are emerging as optimal tools for their identification and analysis . an important lagrangian technique which is starting to be widely used in oceanography </S>",
    "<S> is that of finite - size lyapunov exponents ( fsles ) . despite this growing relevance </S>",
    "<S> there are still many open questions concerning the reliability of the fsles in order to analyse the ocean dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is still unclear how robust they are when confronted with real data . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the effect on this lagrangian technique of the two most important effects when facing real data , namely noise and dynamics of unsolved scales . our results , using as a benchmarch data from a primitive numerical model of the mediterranean sea , show that even when some dynamics is missed the fsles results still give an accurate picture of the oceanic transport properties .    </S>",
    "<S> lagrangian viewpoint @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lagrangian diagnostics exploit the spatio - temporal variability of the velocity field by following fluid particle trajectories , in contrast with eulerian diagnostics , which analyze only frozen snapshots of data . among lagrangian techniques </S>",
    "<S> the most used ones involve the computation of local lyapunov exponents ( lle ) which measure the relative dispersion of transported particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lles give information on dispersion processes but also , and even more importantly , can be used to detect and visualize lagrangian coherent structures ( lcss ) in the flow like vortices , barriers to transport , fronts , etc.@xcite .    the standard definition of lyapunov exponents @xcite involves a double limit , in which infinitely - long times and infinitesimal initial separations are taken . </S>",
    "<S> these limits can not be practically implemented when dealing with realistic flows of geophysical origin . over real data , </S>",
    "<S> lles are defined by relaxing some of the limit procedures . in finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftle ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite trajectory separations are computed starting still at infinitesimal distance , but only for a finite time . in the case of finite - size lyapunov exponents ( fsle ) , the key tool used in our work @xcite , one computes the time which is taken for two trajectories , initially separated by a finite distance , to reach a larger final finite distance .    </S>",
    "<S> fsles are attracting the attention of the oceanographic community @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main reasons for this interest , within the framework of their ability for studying lcss and dispersion processes , are the following : a ) they identify and display the dynamical structures in the flow that strongly organizes fluid motion ( the above mentioned lcss , which are defined as _ ridges of the fsles fields _ ) ; b ) they are relatively easy to compute ; c ) they provide extra information on characteristics time - scales for the dynamics ; and d ) they are able to reveal oceanic structures below the nominal resolution of the velocity field being analyzed . in addition , fsles are specially suited to analyze transport in closed areas @xcite .    despite the growing number of applications of fsles , a rigorous analysis of many of their properties is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> there are two main concerns before applying fsle to real data , namely the effect of noise and the role of observation scale . concerning noise , real data are discretized and noisy , and this can affect the reliability of fsle - based diagnostics ( recent related studies for ftle can be consulted in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> concerning scale properties , fsles can be obtained over a grid finer than that of the data . </S>",
    "<S> this enables to study submesoscale processes under the typical mesoscales ( below @xmath0 kilometers ) that nowadays provide , for example , altimetry data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but then the question is if finer - grid lcss are meaningful or just an artifact . on the other side </S>",
    "<S> , we can have access to a limited - resolution velocity field , and then ask ourselves if any refinement in the velocity grid ( by improved data acquisition , for instance ) is going to modify our previous assessment of lcs at the rougher scale . the main objective of this paper is to address these questions , in particular with reference to their potential applications into ocean dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> a related study of the sensitivity of relative dispersion of particles statistics , when the spatial resolution of the velocity field changes , has appeared recently @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the benchmark for the study of fsles properties used in this work is a the two - dimensional velocity field of the marine surface obtained from a numerical model of the mediterranean sea . </S>",
    "<S> the first half of the paper is devoted to study what we have just called scale properties of the fsle field . by changing gradually the resolution of the grid on which they are computed </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that they have typical multifractal properties . </S>",
    "<S> this means , in particular , that fsles obtained for a finer resolution than that provided by the data provides non - artificial information . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we will consider a somewhat opposite case , i.e. , what happens to the fsles if the velocity - data grid is changed . </S>",
    "<S> their robustness under data - resolution transformations will be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the second half of the work will analyze the effect of noise . </S>",
    "<S> again , two different scenarios are considered : a ) uncertainties in the velocity data , and b ) noise in the particle trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> fsles will be shown to be robust against these two sources of error , and the reasons for this will be discussed . </S>"
