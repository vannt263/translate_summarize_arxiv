    "an important issue of controversy in the magnetic reconnection community is the minimal conditions required for fast magnetic reconnection to occur in a plasma and the minimal modeling requirements to resolve it @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to model reconnection was carried out by sweet @xcite and parker @xcite , who used a resistive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model .",
    "their approach was only successful in modeling a slow form of reconnection and not the much faster reconnection that is observed in laboratory and space plasma .",
    "the geospace environmental modeling ( gem ) reconnection challenge problem was introduced in @xcite and studied with a variety of models to identify the essential physics required to model collisionless magnetic reconnection .",
    "this original gem article concluded that all models that include the hall term in the generalized ohm s law produced essentially indistinguishable rates of reconnection . the only other model in their study that admitted fast reconnection was mhd with large anomalous ( e.g. , current - dependent ) resistivity ,",
    "although as expected it did not exhibit the quadrupole out - of - plane magnetic field pattern that appears to characterize models which incorporate the hall term .",
    "since inclusion of hall effects had been identified as the critical ingredient to admit fast reconnection , bessho and bhattacharjee studied electron - positron plasmas , for which the hall term is zero@xcite .",
    "their particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of the gem problem ( with the mass ratio reset from 25 to 1 ) exhibited fast reconnection for temperature ratios of 5 and 1 .",
    "they found that the structure of the reconnection region still shows an x - point , although as expected the out - of - plane magnetic field does not show the quadrupole structure that appears in models that incorporate hall term effects .",
    "this prompted us to ask if it is possible to get fast reconnection if the hall term is absent and the pressures are modeled as isotropic . therefore we chose to study reconnection in an electron - positron plasma using a two - fluid model with isotropic pressure .",
    "plasma consists of charged particles interacting with the electromagnetic field . in the absence of gravity and quantum - mechanical effects the particles of a plasma satisfy maxwell s equations and the lorentz force to govern particle motion : v @xmath0 here @xmath1 is magnetic field , @xmath2 is electric field , @xmath3 is the speed of light , @xmath4 is electric permittivity , @xmath5 is particle index , @xmath6 is particle position , @xmath7 is ( proper ) particle velocity , where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor , @xmath9 is particle charge , @xmath10 is particle mass , @xmath11 is charge density , @xmath12 is current density , and @xmath13 is particle charge distribution ( e.g. , a unit impulse function ) .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) codes model plasma by attempting to evolve in a mixed eulerian - lagrangian framework : particles are treated in a lagrangian way , while the electromagnetic field sits on an eulerian computational mesh .",
    "the boltzmann model replaces the particles with particle ( probability ) density functions @xmath14 of space , velocity , and time , for each species @xmath15",
    ". the boltzmann equation asserts conservation ( or balance ) of particles in phase space : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is ( proper ) velocity in phase space , and @xmath18 is a collision operator which is a function of @xmath19 , where @xmath5 ranges over all species .",
    "the collisionless boltzmann equation ( alias _ vlasov equation _ ) asserts that @xmath20 .",
    "maxwell s equations are coupled to the boltzmann equation by the relations @xmath21 u      multiplying the boltzmann equation by powers of velocity and integrating over velocity space yields fluid equations .",
    "generic two - fluid equations for a two - species plasma are : @xmath22 the variables are defined as follows : @xmath23 and @xmath24 are ion and electron species indices ; for species @xmath25 , @xmath26 is particle charge , @xmath27 is particle mass , @xmath28 is particle number density , @xmath29 is mass density , @xmath30 is charge density , @xmath31 is current density , @xmath32 is the pressure tensor , @xmath33 is gas - dynamic energy , @xmath34 is the heat flux , @xmath35 denotes the interspecies drag force on the ions , @xmath36 denotes heating due to friction ( drag ) , and @xmath37 denotes the interspecies thermal heat transfer to the ions .      to close the system we must posit constitutive relations for the nonevolved quantities . in a collisionless model we neglect the terms that come from the collision operator : @xmath34 , @xmath38 , @xmath36 , and @xmath39 . in an isotropic model",
    "we assume that the pressure tensor is a scalar pressure times the identity tensor : @xmath40 ; this leads to the constitutive relation @xmath41 .",
    "multiplying the momentum equations of each species by its charge to mass ratio and summing gives a balance law for net current .",
    "invoking the assumption of quasineutrality ( @xmath42 ) and solving this law for electric field gives the generalized ohm s law , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass - averaged fluid velocity and where the electric field in the frame of reference of the fluid is the sum of four terms : @xmath45 here we adopt the convenction that @xmath46 , and we have assumed that the electrical resistance @xmath47 equals @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the _ resistivity _ ) , a simple function of the drift velocity , i.e. , of the current .",
    "ideal mhd assumes that @xmath50 , and resistive mhd assumes that @xmath51 .    substituting ohm s law into faraday s",
    "law @xmath52 yields @xmath53 , which implies that the flux of @xmath1 through a surface convected by @xmath44 can only change if the curl of @xmath54 is nonzero .",
    "for which @xmath55 , then magnetic flux is convected by @xmath56 and the topology of magnetic field lines can not change .",
    "in particular , if we merely add the hall term to the ideal ohm s law , then @xmath57 , i.e. , the magnetic field is essentially carried by the electrons .",
    "hall - mediated fast reconnection requires a small amount of resistivity as well . ]    in an electron - positron plasma the masses of ions and electrons are identical and the hall term vanishes . also ,",
    "if pressure is isotropic and density varies slowly , then the curl of the pressure term is zero . in the collisionless two - fluid model",
    "the resistivity is zero .",
    "so for our two - fluid model reconnection could only happen by means of the inertial term ( or numerical diffusion ) .",
    "the collisionless two - fluid equations we solved were u @xmath58 these equations were studied extensively by shumlak and loverich @xcite and hakim , shumlak , and loverich @xcite . a version of this model with anisotropic pressure was also considered by hakim @xcite .",
    "this system is identical in apearance with the two - fluid system  if the correction potentials @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which we have added for numerical divergence cleaning purposes , are zero .",
    "these equations imply a wave equation that propagates the divergence constraint error at the speed @xmath61 .",
    "we select @xmath62 .",
    "we nondimensionalized this system by choosing typical values of magnetic field @xmath63 , ( ion ) number density @xmath64 , particle charge @xmath65 , and combined particle mass @xmath66 .",
    "this implies a choice ( 1 ) of characteristic time scale @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the cyclotron frequency of a typical particle , ( 2 ) of characteristic velocity @xmath69 , a typical alfvn speed , where @xmath70 is the permeability of magnetic field and ( 3 ) straightforwardly of all other quantities .",
    "replacing every quantity @xmath71 with nondimensional representation @xmath72 gives a system governing the @xmath73 values with exactly the same appearance , except that @xmath74 = @xmath75 .",
    "we drop hats .",
    "with the exception that our nondimensionalized light speed is 10 rather than their value of 20 , our settings are equivalent to those of @xcite , which reflect the settings and conventions of the original gem problem @xcite . to map our si - like nondimensionalization onto their gaussian - like nondimensionalization , rescale the electromagnetic field by @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the computational domain is the rectangular domain @xmath78\\times[-l_y/2,l_y/2]$ ] , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the problem is symmetric under reflection across either the horizontal or vertical axis .",
    "the domain is periodic in the @xmath81-axis .",
    "the boundaries perpendicular to the @xmath82-axis are thermally insulating conducting wall boundaries .",
    "a conducting wall boundary is a solid wall boundary ( with slip boundary conditions in the case of ideal plasma ) for the fluid variables , and the electric field at the boundary has no component parallel to the boundary .",
    "we also assume that magnetic field runs parallel to and so does not penetrate the boundary ( this follows from ohm s law of ideal mhd , but we assume it holds generally ) .",
    "we carried out simulations for the following choices of the gem model parameters : @xmath83      the initial conditions are a perturbed harris sheet equilibrium .",
    "the unperturbed equilibrium is given by @xmath84 on top of this the magnetic field is perturbed by @xmath85 in the gem problem the initial condition constants are @xmath86",
    "in defining and discussing magnetic flux we restrict ourselves to the first quadrant of the domain , referring to it as if it were the entire domain .",
    "the ideal mhd model implies the frozen - in flux condition , which says that magnetic flux is convected with the fluid .",
    "the boundary conditions and symmetries of the problem dictate that at the boundaries fluid can only move parallel to the boundaries and that the in - plane fluid velocity at the corners must be zero .",
    "therefore , the frozen - in flux condition would say that the flux through any boundary must remain constant .    in fact , for models which permit reconnection , the frozen - in flux condition breaks down near the x - point , allowing magnetic field to diffuse and allowing field lines to break and reconnect so that they pass through the horizontal axis .",
    "we therefore define magnetic reconnection to be the loss of magnetic flux through the vertical axis into the first quadrant :    the reconnected flux @xmath87 is defined by @xmath88    the rate of reconnection is minus the value of the out - of - plane component of the electric field at the origin ( i.e.  the x - point ) . and hall terms in ohm",
    "s law can not give fast reconnection , since both these terms must vanish at the origin . ]",
    "@xmath89    since @xmath90 is zero at the conducting wall .",
    "the gem problem has reflectional symmetry across the horizontal and vertical axes .",
    "we impose this symmetry by restricting our computations to the first quadrant . at the origin , symmetries across the horizontal and vertical axes mean that vectors have only an out - of - plane component and pseudovectors must be zero .",
    "symmetries at the origin reduce ohm s law to : @xmath91 if we neglect resistivity , off - diagonal pressure components , and assume that the flow of charge and mass toward or away from the origin is small , then this becomes @xmath92 i.e. , the value of @xmath93 at the origin will tend to track with @xmath87 .",
    "following the precedent of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we carried out simulations of the gem problem using a third - order shock - capturing runge - kutta discontinuous galerkin solver for a collisionless two - fluid model with isotropic pressure for each species .",
    "( we enforced the divergence cleaning for the magnetic field but not for the electric field . )",
    "we carried out simulations on a quarter domain ( hence enforcing symmetry ) for mesh sizes of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "for the low mesh resolution we seemed to observe fast reconnection in the electron - positron plasma ( based on the pattern of magnetic field lines and the rates of reconnection ) , but not for high resolutions .",
    "we hypothesize that the electron inertial term coupled with sufficient ( numerical ) resistivity is sufficient to yield fast reconnection . in future studies",
    "we hope to explicitly introduce collisional ( diffusive ) terms ( rather than relying on numerical diffusion ) and explore whether we can show convergence to fast reconnection for resistive isotropic two - fluid plasma .",
    "we plotted reconnected flux , @xmath97 , and a crude calculation of -@xmath98 ( the cumulative sum of @xmath99 evaluated at integer times ) for all three combinations of mass ratio and temperature ratio .",
    "our plots indicate that @xmath97 only tracked with reconnected flux for the high - resolution simulations of electron - positron plasma up until the time when a large magnetic island formed around the origin .",
