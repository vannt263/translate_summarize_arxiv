    "perturbative qcd at finite temperature and density can be used to describe properties of an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . however , using only bare propagators and vertices infrared divergent and gauge dependent result are obtained .",
    "these problems can be partly avoided by using the hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummation technique @xcite . in this way",
    "consistent results , which are complete to leading order in the coupling constant and gauge independent , are found . at the same time the infrared behavior is improved by the presence of effective masses in the htl propagators .",
    "this method has been applied to various quantities of the qgp , such as damping rates of quarks and gluons , energy loss of energetic partons , thermalization times , viscosity , and photon and dilepton production @xcite .",
    "the htl method has been derived within the imaginary time formalism , which is restricted to equilibrium situations . however , in relativistic heavy ion collisions the formation of a pre - equilibrium parton gas has to be expected .",
    "indeed it is not clear whether a complete thermal and chemical equilibrium will be reached in the evolution of the fireball at all @xcite .",
    "therefore it is desirable to extend the htl resummation technique to non - equilibrium . for this purpose",
    "we have to start from the real time formalism ( rtf ) @xcite .",
    "similar investigations have been performed by baier et al .",
    "@xcite .    in the rtf formalism propagators",
    "are given by @xmath0-matrices @xcite .",
    "for example the scalar propagator reads d(k ) & = & (    cc & 0 + 0 & +    ) - 2i ( k^2-m^2 ) + & & (    cc f_b & ( -k_0)+f_b + ( k_0)+f_b & f_b +    ) .

    "a particular useful representation of the propagators in the rtf is the keldysh representation , where retarded , advanced , and symmetric propagators are defined as linear combinations of the four components of ( [ e1 ] ) , of which only three are independent @xcite : d_r & = & d_11-d_12 , + d_a & = & d_11-d_21 , + d_f & = & d_11+d_22.[e2 ] for example , the bare scalar propagator in the keldysh representation is given by d_r(k ) & = & , + d_a(k ) & = & , + d_f(k ) & = & -2i ( 1 + 2f_b ) ( k^2-m^2 ) .",
    "[ e3 ] the distribution functions only appear in the symmetric component @xmath6 , which is of particular advantage for the htl diagrams where the terms containing distribution functions dominate .",
    "before we are going to calculate htl s in non - equilibrium we would like to note here that we do not aim to describe the thermalization of a partonic fireball starting far from equilibrium . as discussed in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) this problem requires the use of non - perturbative methods beyond the htl perturbation theory .",
    "we have situations in mind where we can use quasistatic distributions , i.e. , where the equilibration is slow compared to the process under consideration .",
    "such a situation might be the case for the chemical equilibration of the parton gas in relativistic heavy ion collisions after a thermal equilibrium has been achieved rapidly @xcite .",
    "also anisotropic momentum distributions taking account of the longitudinal and transverse expansion might be considered @xcite .",
    "at least as long as we are close to equilibrium the use of quasistatic distributions within the htl method , based on the weak coupling limit @xmath7 , is justified by the fact that the equilibration time @xmath8 is large compared to the htl time scale @xmath9 .",
    "we have chosen a non - equilibrium qed plasma as an example for the use of the htl method as the computation of the htl photon self energy is much easier than the one of the htl gluon self energy .",
    "after all , the results for these self energies differ only by a constant color and flavor factor .",
    "the htl photon self energy is given by the one - loop diagram shown in fig.1 , where the internal momenta are hard compared to the external . in equilibrium",
    "this can be achieved in the weak coupling limit by considering internal momenta of the order of the temperature @xmath10 or larger and external of the order @xmath11 or smaller . in non - equilibrium",
    "we might replace the temperature by the average momentum following from the distribution function under consideration .    here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the longitudinal component of the self energy , i.e. @xmath12 . using the keldysh representation and @xmath13 for the fermion propagators , we find & & _ r^l(p)=-2ie^2 ( q_0k_0+*q * ) + & & .",

    "[ e11 ] this equation is solved by the following ansatz : & & d^*_f^l(p ) = ( 1 + 2f_b ) ( p_0 ) [ d^*_r^l(p)-d^*_a^l(p ) ] + & & + \\{_f^l(p)-(1 + 2f_b ) ( p_0 ) [ _ r^l(p)-_a^l(p ) ] } + & & _",

    "as an example for the application of the non - equilibrium htl resummation technique we consider the interaction or damping rate of an energetic electron in a non - equilibrium qed plasma .",
    "this quantity is one of the mostly studied within the htl method .",
    "( for references see @xcite . ) the htl method does not lead to an infrared finite result in this case since there is not enough screening in the transverse part of the htl photon propagator .",
    "after all we want to study this example , since we are only interested in the comparison between the equilibrium and the non - equilibrium case .",
    "the interaction rate is defined by @xcite ( p)=- [ 1-f_f(p , x ) ] tr [ p/ i m _ r(p_0=p,*p * ) ] , [ e15 ] where @xmath27 is the retarded electron self energy . using only bare propagators",
    "the lowest order contribution to @xmath28 comes from the two - loop diagram of fig.3 .",

[ e16 ] in equilibrium this term vanishes due to detailed balance .    applying the htl method to the electron interaction rate results in using the one - loop diagram of fig.4 containing a resummed photon propagator for the electron self energy @xcite .",
    "owing to the non - zero imaginary part of the htl photon self energy appearing in the resummed photon propagator this diagram exhibits an imaginary part .",
    "since there is no pinch singularity in the htl resummed photon propagator this diagram is also free of pinch singularities . in other words ,",
    "the use of the htl method to lowest order reduces two - loop diagrams , containing possible pinch singularities , to one - loop diagrams with resummed propagators , where pinch terms are absent .    following the equilibrium calculation @xcite",

    "the logarithm in this expression reflects the presence of an infrared singularity , which has been regularized by assuming an infrared cutoff of the order @xmath30 .",
    "the constant under the logarithm can not be calculated within the htl method .",
    "as expected this result reduces to the equilibrium one @xcite , if we replace @xmath20 by @xmath31 ..    pinch terms may arise , however , in higher order contributions of the htl perturbation theory , such as the one shown in fig.5 , where the product of a retarded htl and an advanced htl propagator at the same momentum @xmath29 shows up .    resumming the photon self energy @xmath32 , which contains htl electron propagators and htl vertices , leads to a dressed propagator beyond the htl resummation .",

    "finally we will show that the htl electron self energy and the htl electron - photon vertex fulfill the same ward identities in non - equilibrium as in equilibrium .",
