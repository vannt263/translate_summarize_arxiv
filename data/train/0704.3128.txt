    "a remarkable progress in the observation of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been the identification of several very good correlations among the grb observables ( see schaefer 2007 for a review ) . based on several of those correlations",
    ", some people have eagerly proposed to use grbs as standard candles to probe the cosmological hubble diagram to very high redshift ( * ? ? ?",

    "enlightening comments and criticism on grbs as standard candles can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all the grb correlations have been obtained by fitting a hybrid grb sample without discriminating the redshift .",
    "indeed , the redshift in the sample usually spans a very large range : from @xmath4 up to @xmath5 .",
    "this is of course caused by the fact that we do not have an enough number of grbs with measured redshifts limited in a small range .",
    "then , inevitably , the effect of the grb evolution with the redshift , and the selection effects , have been ignored .",
    "this raises an important question about whether the relations that people have found reflect the true physics of grbs or they are just superficial .",
    "[ see @xcite for a nice discussion on the selection effect and the correlation between the grb peak spectral energy and the isotropic - equivalent / jet collimated energy . ]    for objects distributing from @xmath4 to @xmath6 , it is hard to believe that they do not evolve .",
    "there are cumulative evidences suggesting that long - duration grbs prefer to occur in low - metallicity galaxies @xcite . with a sample of five nearby grbs",
    ", @xcite have found that the isotropic energy of grbs is anti - correlated with the metallicity in the host galaxy [ ] wol07 .",
    "it is well known that metallicities evolve strongly with the cosmological redshift @xcite .",
    "hence , the evolution of grbs with the redshift is naturally expected ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter",
    ", we use the amati relation as an example to test the cosmic evolution of grbs .",
    "the amati relation is a correlation between the isotropic - equivalent energy of long - duration grbs and the peak energy of their integrated spectra in the grb frame @xcite @xmath7 the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath8 is defined in the @xmath9@xmath10 kev band in the grb frame .    with a sample of 41 long grbs with firmly determined redshifts and peak spectral energy ,",
    "@xcite has obtained that @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the least squares method ( @xmath13 in kev and @xmath8 in @xmath14 erg ) ; and @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the maximum likelihood method with an intrinsic dispersion in the relation ( [ amati ] ) being included .",
    "long grbs detected by and having measured redshifts and @xmath13 are found to be consistent with the amati relation @xcite .",
    "the difference in the values of the parameters obtained with the two methods can be explained as follows .",
    "the maximum likelihood method directly probes the intrinsic relation between the two variables , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , roughly speaking , the least squares method estimates the average value of @xmath19 at a given @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite has shown that , when @xmath19 has a gaussian distribution with a dispersion @xmath22 , and the relation @xmath23 has an intrinsic dispersion @xmath24 in @xmath20 , @xmath25 is related to @xmath2 by @xmath26 @xcite has found that @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . then by equation ( [ tee ] ) we have @xmath30 , which is close to the value of @xmath31 obtained by the least squares method .    to test if the amati relation varies with the cosmological redshift , in this letter we separate a sample of 48 long grbs [ consisting of the long 41 grbs from @xcite and seven additional long grbs from @xcite ] into four groups by the grb redshift .",
    "that is , we sort the grbs by their redshifts , and divide them into four groups with redshifts distributing from low values to high values .",
    "each group contains 12 grbs ( for details see section [ evol ] ) .",
    "we then fit each group by equation ( [ amati ] ) and calculate the mean redshift , and check if the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 evolve with the redshift .",
    "as we will see that , the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 strongly vary with the redshift .",
    "the variation is not likely to arise from the selection effect and hence may indicate that grbs evolve strongly with the cosmological redshift .    throughout the letter",
    ", we follow @xcite to adopt a cosmology with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 km s@xmath35 mpc@xmath35 .",
    "to test if the amati relation ( [ amati ] ) evolves with the redshift , we separate a sample of 48 long grbs into four groups according to the redshift of the grbs , then fit each group with equation ( [ amati ] ) .",

    "* table 1 ) , and seven additional long grbs from @xcite .",

    "since a grb sample with @xmath36 is very incomplete , we select only grbs with @xmath37 and hence grb 060218 ( @xmath38 ) is not included .",
    "grb 060614 is also excluded from our sample because of the very large uncertainty in its @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "hence , we have only @xmath3 percent of chance that the variation presented in section [ evol ] is caused by the selection effect .",
    "if grbs do not evolve with the redshift and the selection effects are not important , we would expect that the amati relation does not change with the redshift .",
    "hence , from the variation of the amati relation with the redshift we may get some clues on the cosmic evolution of grbs .    by dividing the 48 grbs in @xcite into four groups by their redshifts and fitting each group separately , we have found that the isotropic - equivalent energy and the peak spectral energy of grbs remain being correlated in each group , even with a smaller dispersion than that for the whole sample . however , the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the amati relation ( [ amati ] ) evolve strongly with the redshift ( eqs .",
    "[ az_f ] and [ bz_f ] ) .",

    "[ az_f ] and [ bz_f ] ) . with monte - carlo simulations",
    "we have shown that there is only @xmath3 percent of chance that the observed variation is caused by the selection effect .",
    "hence , the variation of the amati relation with the redshift that we have discovered may reflect the cosmic evolution of grbs and indicates that grbs are not standard candles .",
    "our results are limited by the small number of grbs in the sample : we have 48 grbs in total , and only @xmath118 grbs in each group . to get a more reliable conclusion ,",
    "the number of grbs with well determined redshifts and spectra need be significantly expanded . since the launch of , the fraction of grbs with measured redshifts has increased rapidly .",
    "however , unfortunately , due to the narrow energy range of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on , the fraction of bursts that have accurately determined peak / isotropic energy has not increased proportionally",
    ". the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( ) scheduled for launch in late 2007 will provide us with more promise for this purpose @xcite .",
    "we must also stress that our treatment on the selection effect has been greatly simplified .",
    "the grbs in the sample were detected and measured by different instruments , hence the selection effect is much more complicated .",
    "a more careful consideration of the various selection biases is required to determine if the observed evolution of the amati relation reflects the cosmic evolution of grbs .",
    "no matter what the conclusion will be ( the variation of parameters is caused by the grb evolution effect or by the selection effect ) , our results suggest that it is a great risk to use grbs with redshifts spanning a large range as a single sample to draw physics by statistically analyzing the correlations among observables .",
    "although we have only tested the amati relation , it would be surprising if any of the other relations ( e.g. , the ghirlanda relation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not change with the redshift .",
