    "advances in computational algorithms as well as hardware speed have enabled a new era of precision calculations in the few - nucleon sector .",
    "it is now possible to compute binding properties , and in some cases other properties , of nuclei up through a=10 , starting with the schrdinger equation plus phenomenological two- and three - body interactions , to a precision that allows for a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "computations are now precise enough that the quantitative role of special relativity becomes relevant . in principle , poincar invariance is an exact symmetry that should be satisfied by all numerical calculations , thereby permitting comparisons between theory and experiment to rest entirely upon the nuclear dynamics . in practice ,    1 .",
    "consistent relativistic computation is much more numerically intensive , thus motivating non - relativistic calculations in practice .",
    "most estimates of relativistic effects have been quantitatively small enough that the non - relativistic calculations have satisfactory precision .",
    "an additional complication is that a non - relativistic model does not imply a unique relativistic extension .",
    "relativistic invariance requires the invariance of probabilities in different inertial coordinate systems ; this symmetry can be satisfied in a variety of frameworks and models that share the same non - relativistic limit .",
    "since information is lost in taking the non - relativistic limit , there is no unique way to get it back .",
    "at the two - body level , calculations in a single inertial coordinate system are not constrained by poincar invariance ; it only ensures that the results in all other inertial coordinate systems are equivalent .",
    "this affects how the two - body dynamics is embedded in the three - body problem .",
    "in addition , there is a unitary group of three - body scattering equivalences that preserves poincar invariance and leaves the two and three - body scattering and bound state observables unchanged , at the expense making off - shell modifications and modifications to the two and three - body interactions .",
    "this freedom is not constrained by experiment .",
    "this means that the contributions of relativistic effects , off - shell effects , and three - body interactions can not be uniquely separated in the three - body problem .",
    "therefore , there is no single , unique `` relativistic effect '' in few - nucleon calculations .",
    "however , we find that , for a variety of dynamical input and some variation in model assumptions , there is a consistent pattern in the quantitative aspects of relativity in the calculations .",
    "there are two primary approaches for modeling relativistic few - body problems in quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider here a class of poincar invariant quantum models  @xcite of few - particle systems . in these models poincar invariance is an _",
    "exact _ symmetry that is realized by a unitary representation of the poincar group on the few - particle hilbert space .",
    "a number of equivalent representations of poincar invariant few - body models are given in  @xcite .",
    "poincar invariant quantum mechanics has as its starting point a hilbert space with a fixed number of particles ( nucleons ) and a set of 2- , 3-,  body interactions .",
    "these features it shares with its non - relativistic counterpart based upon the schrdinger equation .",
    "it differs from the latter in the relationship between interactions in different inertial reference frames . at the level of two - body phenomenology",
    ", one can make connections to parameters fitted to data on the basis of the schrdinger equation .",
    "if this is done in one inertial coordinate system , the poincar invariance can be used to generate interactions in any other inertial frame .",
    "there are several ways to do this , as will be discussed below .",
    "glckle , kamada , and collaborators  @xcite have studied aspects of poincar invariant quantum mechanics in two- and three - body problems . they have introduced a mapping between the interactions in the relativistic two - body mass operator and the interactions in the non - relativistic center - of - momentum two - body hamiltonian , and have solved the three - body problem for specific interactions @xcite .",
    "different methods for utilizing realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions in relativistic calculations were given by coester , pieper and serduke @xcite and by glckle , lee , and coester @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to identify the dominant sources of relativistic effects for a variety of two - body mappings and interactions .",
    "the second approach to the relativistic few - body problem uses quasipotential equations .",
    "these are relations between covariant amplitudes in local field theory .",
    "when some of the amplitudes are treated as input , these relations become equations for the remaining amplitudes .",
    "matrix elements of few - body observables in eigenstates of the four momentum can be calculated from the solution of the quasipotential equations using mandelstam s method  @xcite . for systems of strongly interacting particles ,",
    "the input to these equations is not known and must be modeled , as in poincar invariant quantum mechanics . while calculations of the same observables can be computed in both approaches , there exist no unique relation between quasipotential equations and poincar invariant quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , quasipotential models have played a historically important and valuable role in motivating the structure of model nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the nature of the relativistic effects depends upon the specific assumptions used to extract quantum mechanical interactions from the quasipotential equations .",
    "stadler and gross  @xcite have studied solutions to the three - nucleon bound state problem in the context of the spectator approximation to a meson - nucleon field theory .",
    "sammarruca and machleidt  @xcite have studied specific kinematic factors that arise in extracting quantum mechanical interactions from quasipotential equations in an effort to identify the dominant sources of relativistic effects .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to identify the important quantitative relativistic effects within the framework of poincar invariant quantum mechanics .",
    "the goal in this paper is not to provide complete solutions to a set of three - body problems , but rather to understand where the major relativistic effects occur .",
    "in fact , the most important effects are embedded in multiplicative kinematic factors , which makes it relatively easy to incorporate them into a schrdinger - based momentum - space three - body code .",
    "one - nucleon momentum / spin eigenstates satisfy the normalization condition : @xmath0 these states transform as mass @xmath1 spin @xmath2 irreducible representations of the poincar group @xcite . for the two - body problem",
    "it is useful to use a basis that transforms irreducibly with respect to the tensor product of two one - body representations .",
    "these poincar irreducible eigenstates have the structure @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total linear momentum , @xmath5 is the canonical spin , @xmath6 is the @xmath7-component of the canonical spin , and @xmath8 is related to the invariant invariant mass of the non - interacting two - body system by @xmath9 the quantum numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 are degeneracy quantum numbers that determine the multiplicity of each representation with the same @xmath12 and @xmath5 ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 have the same spectrum as the non - relativistic total spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "the overlap coefficients with the tensor product of single particle states are poincar clebsch - gordan coefficients which can be found in ( @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the two - body mass operator is defined by adding interactions to the non - interacting mass operator : @xmath13 in poincar invariant quantum mechanics the delta functions that multiply interactions are important . the two - body interaction acting on the two - body hilbert space",
    "is denoted by @xmath14 ; @xmath15 denotes the internal two - body interaction related to @xmath14 by @xmath16 @xmath17    with this choice of @xmath14 it is possible to find simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath18 , @xmath4 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "these states transform like mass @xmath18 , spin @xmath21 irreducible representations of the poincar group .",
    "since these eigenstates are complete they define the interacting two - body dynamics .",
    "two - particle scattering is described by the transition operator @xmath22 which satisfies the relativistic lippmann - schwinger equation : @xmath23 this transition operator has the same relation to the differential cross section as the corresponding non - relativistic expression , except that the single particle masses , @xmath1 , appearing in the incident current and phase space factors are replaced by the corresponding single particle energies , @xmath24 . a proof based on time - dependent scattering theory is given in @xcite .    the reduced two - body transition operator @xmath25 is related to @xmath26 by @xmath27 @xmath28",
    "all realistic descriptions of the quantum mechanical two - nucleon system utilize adjustable parameters in the interactions to fit published nucleon - nucleon phase - shift data and the deuteron binding energy .",
    "for poincar invariant quantum mechanical models , these parameters involve interaction strengths and ranges ; for quasipotential models , the parameters may include meson - nucleon coupling strengths and form factors . since there is an extensive investment of effort in fitting nucleon - nucleon data to solutions to the schrdinger equation , it is advantageous to directly use existing high - quality interactions to construct equivalent relativistic interactions .",
    "the relationship between relativistic and non - relativistic models fit to the same data is more complicated than the relation obtained by taking the non - relativistic limit of the relativistic model .",
    "understanding the nature of the fitting process is the first element needed to understand the nature of relativistic corrections .",
    "the scattering cross section is a relativistic invariant  @xcite ; however , the angular distributions and spins have a frame dependence with known kinematic transformation properties .",
    "kinematic lorentz transformations are used to correctly transform measured laboratory differential scattering cross sections to the center of momentum frame .",
    "the properly transformed data are used to fit interactions that reproduce this data by solving the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .    the scattering operator and consequently the phase shifts for a given angular momentum are poincar invariant .",
    "the phase shifts can be tabulated as functions of the invariant center of momentum momentum or energy , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "these functions are equal when the center of momentum energy @xmath31 and invariant momentum @xmath8 are related by the correct relativistic relation . for equal mass particles",
    "this relation is @xmath32 which implies @xmath33    in the fitting procedure these phase shifts are identified with phase shifts obtained by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "this can be done in one of two _ inequivalent _ ways @xcite .",
    "the first is by identifying @xmath29 with the corresponding @xmath8-dependent schrdinger phase shift and the second is by identifying @xmath34 with the corresponding @xmath31-dependent schrdinger phase shift .",
    "these are inequivalent because non - relativistically @xmath31 and @xmath8 are related by @xmath35 .",
    "if these procedures are used there are no relativistic corrections in the center of momentum frame when compared to a relativistic model fit to the same data .",
    "the schrdinger equation produces the exact poincar invariant phase shifts either as functions of the center of momentum energy or momentum ( but not both ) .    the problem that can arise",
    "is if the phase shifts are fit to transformed cross section data as functions of @xmath8 and the potential is constructed by matching the phase shifts obtained from the schrdinger equation as functions of @xmath31 , then the phase shift or cross section predicted at energy @xmath35 will be the same as the `` measured '' phase shift a shifted energy @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , if the phase shifts are fit to transformed cross section data as functions of @xmath31 and the potential is constructed by matching the phase shifts obtained from the schrdinger equation as functions of @xmath8 then the phase shift or cross section predicted at momentum @xmath37 will be the same as the measured phase shift a shifted momentum @xmath38 .",
    "this inconsistency increases with momentum . at relativistic energies the inconsistencies are of the same scale as typical relativistic corrections .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 , which compares the non - relativistic and relativistic energies @xmath39 to @xmath40 for a nucleon with momenta @xmath8 up to 1  gev .",
    "these curves show the scale of the energy mismatch as a function of @xmath8 ; it is a 7% effect at 1  gev .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the same effect with the total cross section .",
    "the curves in figure 2 compare the total cross sections in the born approximation for the malfliet - tjon v potential @xcite .",
    "the curve in figure 2 is the ratio @xmath41 for @xmath8 up to 1  gev/@xmath42 . in this example figure",
    "shows that an inconsistent treatment of the phase equivalence , while small at low momenta , leads to a 15% percent error in the total cross section at 1  gev/@xmath42 .",
    "thus , the first question that needs to be considered is how the non - relativistic interaction was constructed . for argonne @xmath43 , which is a typical example of a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction ,",
    "the phase shifts are determined as functions of laboratory beam energy @xcite which is converted to center - of - momentum momentum using @xmath44 thus , for the @xmath45 interaction , the solution of the schrdinger equation reproduces the invariant phase shifts @xmath29 as functions of the invariant momentum .",
    "the methods discussed in this paper make use of the phase equivalence between the interactions in the relativistic and non - relativistic schrdinger equations .",
    "we consider three ways of utilizing two - body phenomenology based upon the fitted interactions in  equation in poincar invariant quantum mechanics .",
    "these methods relate the half - shell relativistic two - body transition matrix elements to the half - shell non - relativistic transition matrix elements under different sets of assumptions about the phase shift fitting .",
    "this method was formulated to study relativistic effects in nuclear matter .",
    "it uses a nucleon - nucleon interaction , such as @xmath45 , fit to @xmath29 to construct a scattering equivalent relativistic interaction .",
    "cps  @xcite add an interaction to the square of the non - interacting mass operator to get a -like equation : @xmath46 the operator @xmath47 is identified with the interaction that appears in the non - relativistic schrdinger hamiltonian , @xmath48 .",

    "( [ eq : be ] ) is @xmath51 it would be tedious to evaluate @xmath50 directly ; however , it is never needed because @xmath18 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , all have the same eigenstates .",
    "if @xmath54 is generated by the `` lippmann - schwinger '' equation @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a scattering eigenstate with momentum @xmath8 and @xmath57 is the corresponding plane wave state , then the following half - shell relations follow : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 taking matrix elements in the irreducible plane wave states @xmath62 gives the relation @xmath63 @xmath64^{-1 } \\langle k',l',s ' \\vert { \\hat t}^j   ( e(k ) ) \\vert k , l , s \\rangle = \\ ] ] @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the reduced non - relativistic two - body transition operator .",

    "these calculation suggest that the bulk of the relativistic effects in the transition operators in the faddeev lovelace kernel comes from the kinematic factors that appear in ( [ eq : gxa ] ) , ( [ eq : gxb ] ) or ( [ eq : gxc ] )    the presence of the free resolvent in the faddeev lovelace kernel only serves to improve the approximation to the full kernel , since it is largest on the half shell .",

    "including the correct multiplicative kinematic factors without including spin rotations leads to considerable improvement at 0.5  gev ; and it grows to just over 2% at 1  gev .",
    "this is consistent with previous calculations that suggest the the recoupling coefficients have small effects .    with the balian - brezin method",
    "the inclusion of both the spin factors and kinematic factors involve minor modifications to an existing non - relativistic program .",
    "our conclusion is that negligible errors will be made if the relativistic faddeev - lovelace kernel is approximated by replacing the transition matrix elements of @xmath188 by the expressions in ( [ eq : gxa]),([eq : gxb ] ) , and ( [ eq : gxc ] ) .",
    "care must be used to match the method used to the fitting procedure used to determine the non - relativistic two body interaction .",

    "the inclusion of the correct kinematic factors reduces errors considerably .",
    "the development and the results discussed above utilize wigner s formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics , using a direct construction of a unitary representation of the poincar group on the two - nucleon hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "the two - nucleon interactions have specific connections both to the schrdinger equation and to the three - nucleon problem .",
    "one can also approach these problems within the framework of a quasipotential theory .",
    "the first results for three - nucleon binding were obtained by stadler and gross  @xcite , using the so - called spectator approximation  @xcite . within this framework",
    "they can obtain the observed triton binding while maintaining a fit to the observed nucleon - nucleon phase shifts and the deuteron binding .",
    "when they compare the results of their `` full '' calculation to a nonrelativistic approximation , they find that most of the new effects come from the inclusion of negative - energy states .",
    "these would correspond approximately to three - nucleon interactions in poincar invariant quantum theory .",
    "they also find that so - called `` boost effects '' in their framework are small and give a repulsive contribution to the triton binding .",
    "those results are consistent with the results obtained in poincar invariant quantum theory .    an earlier work by sammarruca and machleidt  @xcite examined the effect of kinematic factors within frameworks based on field theories .",
    "they made use of an earlier relation obtained by brown , jackson and kuo  @xcite , who used quasipotential methods to argue that the non - relativistic interaction should include non - localities .",
    "the brown , jackson , kuo method leads to a modified interaction , however unlike the methods discussed above the new interaction must be refit to the phase shift data .",
    "this method leads to the following relation between their minimal relativistic and nonrelativistic @xmath70 matrices : @xmath233 sammarruca and machleidt then use this modified two - nucleon interaction within their relativistic framework and get a net _ attractive _ correction to @xmath234h binding when using this factor .",
    "again , this is understandable at least naively when considering that the @xmath70 matrices receive essentially the opposite factor from those discussed above [ eqs .",
    "[ eq : gxa]-[eq : gxc ] ] .",
    "however , both the brown , jackson and kuo method and the cgl method in principle require a refitting of the phase shifts to get an exact phase equivalence .",
    "thus we can not make a direct comparison to these methods .",
    "we have explored here the quantitative impact of the requirement of relativistic invariance with the framework of poincar invariant quantum mechanics . in the range of models discussed here ,",
    "the dominant effects are manifested in kinematic terms that can easily be incorporated into a schrdinger - based momentum - space calculation , namely , multiplicative factors of the @xmath235 form , and energy denominators that employ the relativistic energy - momentum relation .",
    "there are additional small effects that come from relativistic corrections to the recoupling coefficients .",
    "these can be minimized by including the correct relativistic kinematic factors .",
    "a correct treatment of these terms involves only minimal modifications of the non - relativistic recoupling coefficients .",
    "quantitatively the effects of all of these corrections are small , and contribute repulsive corrections to three - nucleon binding .",
    "this means that the resolution of the discrepancy between poincar invariant three - nucleon calculations and the experimentally observed binding energies must come from three - nucleon forces .",
    "the quantitative relativistic effects grow with internal momenta ; non - relativistic three - nucleon scattering calculations at energies of several hundred mev may well require corrections beyond the simple square - root factors ."
