    "capillary bonding has been extensively studied in the past , and several models of capillary cohesion have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the scale - up of capillary forces to the macroscopic cohesion of granular media has been investigated by means of both experiments and discrete element numerical simulations @xcite .    in the same way",
    ", solid bonding is found in various materials such as sedimentary rocks ( sandstones , conglomerates and breccia)@xcite , biomaterials such as wheat endosperm ( starch granules forming a compact structure bound together by a protein matrix ) @xcite , and geomaterials like mortars , concrete and asphalt ( aggregates of various sizes glued to each other by a cement paste ) @xcite .",
    "the cohesive behavior due to solid bonds between the particles and the rupture of cemented granular materials have been recently investigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "there is a broad class of processes where the nature of cohesive bonds evolves from solid to liquid and vice versa .",
    "the liquid is generally water with various types of impurities and/or dissolved minerals . as a result of reactive transfers or phase transitions , the liquid may influence the mechanical properties by dissolution of cemented joints or crystallization of solutes .",
    "the mechanical properties can thus evolve in response to external hygrothermic conditions @xcite . in pharmaceutical industry , for example , the process of wet granulation is widely used to manufacture tablets . a liquid composed of solvent(s ) and solute(s )",
    "is mixed with dry powder in order to obtain a homogeneous mixture that would segregate in the absence of the liquid .",
    "the formation of aggregates in the process of mixing has been a subject of extensive investigation @xcite .",
    "the solid tablets are obtained by drying : the solvent evaporates and solid bridges are formed between grains by crystallization , thus ensuring the macroscopic cohesion of the tablets .    in this paper , we are interested in the evolution of the macroscopic cohesion of a wet granular material during the evaporation of a solvent ( water ) and thus crystallization of the solute ( sodium chloride ) . at low liquid contents ,",
    "the water is in the form of capillary bridges between particles .",
    "the hydrous field corresponding to this range of liquid contents is often described as `` pendular '' .",
    "the attractive capillary forces in the presence of liquid bridges between particles endows the material with macroscopic cohesion @xcite . under the action of the surrounding hygrothermic conditions",
    ", the water evaporates and the solutes crystallize to form solid bonds between grains .",
    "the cohesion is initially of capillary origin but begins to increase as soon as the first solid bonds are formed at the free boundary of the sample and a solidification front propagates from the boundary to the center of the sample .",
    "we measure the compressive strength of several samples of glass beads and sand , prepared in the pendular state by mixing with a saturated brine , in the course of drying .",
    "technically , it is not trivial to follow simultaneously the evolution of the internal state due to the evaporation of the brine and the evolution of its mechanical behavior .",
    "moreover , the two limits of purely liquid bonding and purely solid bonding have different behaviors and require specific experimental tools and precautions . for these reasons ,",
    "the experimental campaign involves the preparation of many reproducible samples subjected to identical drying conditions , each sample being destroyed when subjected to simple compression test .",
    "we show that the evolution of the cohesion is governed by three time scales corresponding to the evaporation of a single capillary bridge , the propagation of the cementation front from the surface to the center and the aging of cemented bonds .",
    "these time scales are identified from the experimental campaign together with a theoretical model based on a a simple representation of the evolution of the debonding force between the particles .",
    "this model fits well the compressive strength as a function of an order parameter representing the state of crystallization .    in the following ,",
    "we first describe in section [ sec : exp ] the experimental setup , the procedures of sample preparation and the main results regarding the evolution of the samples and mechanical strength in the course of drying . in section [ sec : model ] , we present our model and compare its predictions with the experimental data .",
    "we conclude with a summary and scopes of this work .",
    "the experimental tests were designed to measure the compressive strength of granular samples during the process of the drying and deposition of a solute at the liquid bridges between the grains .",
    "two types of materials were used in these tests : ( 1 ) a model material composed of glass beads and ( 2 ) a natural material : ventoux sand . in both cases ,",
    "the grains were first washed and dried .",
    "then , they were sieved to keep only the grains with diameters in the range from 0.4 mm to 0.8 mm .",
    "the dry grains were homogeneously mixed with a small amount of saturated brine containing 35.6 g of nacl for 100 g of water in controlled environment ( temperature , humidity ) .",
    "this maximum concentration varies with temperature @xcite .",
    "the samples ( diameter 25 mm and height 17 mm ) were prepared inside a cylindrical mould . at this stage ,",
    "the samples are particularly delicate to handle since their mechanical strength is solely ensured by weak capillary forces acting between the grains . because of this brittleness , particular experimental precautions were necessary in order to avoid damage to the samples upon unmoulding .",
    "each sample is initially a three - phase material including    * a solid phase ( denoted by s ) composed of grains ( glass beads or sand ) with a total mass @xmath0 , * a liquid phase ( denoted by l ) composed of water of mass @xmath1 and dissolved nacl of mass @xmath2 . *",
    "a gaseous phase composed of air and water vapor with negligible mass compared to the two other phases but which carries the kinetics of drying .",
    "thus , the total mass of the sample at this initial state is @xmath3 .",
    "the water evaporates at the surface and causes thermodynamic disequilibrium of the solution .",
    "the equilibrium is recovered through the crystallization of nacl and thus the formation of solid nacl deposits of a total mass @xmath4 .",
    "a crystallization front propagates thus from the boundary towards the center of the sample .",
    "the evolution of a sample is expected to be governed by the ratio @xmath5 to which we refer as the global crystallization index of the sample .",
    "three series of samples were prepared with three different values of the initial liquid content @xmath6 : @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these values were selected in the hydrous field corresponding to the `` pendular state '' where liquid bridges between grains ensure the mechanical integrity of the sample .",
    "the samples were weighed just after preparation , and left to dry at constant temperature @xmath10 c and relative humidity @xmath11 for drying times varying from 15 minutes to 18 hours ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : photo_etuvetexturometre](a ) .    at regular intervals of time ,",
    "the samples were weighed ( mass @xmath12 ) , and then subjected to unconfined vertical compression up to failure .",
    "the tests were carried out by means of a `` low capacity '' press , which allows us to test samples with low dimensions and forces up to 50 n with an accuracy of 0.01 n ; see fig . [",
    "fig : photo_etuvetexturometre](b ) .",
    "the difference @xmath13 yields the mass of the evaporated water and thus that of the crystallized mass fraction of nacl .",
    "since all samples are prepared under similar conditions , they are assumed to follow the same evolution in time .",
    "this allows us to reconstruct the kinetics of crystallization .",
    "\\(a )   ( b )       the evolution of the compressive stress @xmath14 at yield is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmayic_exp ] as a function of the global crystallization index @xmath15 for glass beads and sand , as well as from a theoretical model described in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "all the experimental data collapse nearly on the same curve for glass beads and sand .",
    "we distinguish three regimes in the evolution of the cohesion . as long as @xmath15 is below a threshold @xmath16 , the yield stress is independent of @xmath15 . in this regime , the amount of the crystallized salt at the boundary layer of the sample , where the whole process is initiated due to exchange with the atmosphere , is insufficient to allow for the formation of solid bonds between the particles",
    ". therefore , the yield stress @xmath14 in this regime is only due to the capillary bonds between the particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmayic_exp ] , we see that @xmath14 is independent both of the initial liquid content @xmath17 and of the type of grains .",
    "in fact , both experiments and theoretical analysis suggest that in a homogeneously wetted granular material in the pendular state , the capillary cohesion is practically independent of the liquid content but crucially depends on the number density of the capillary bonds @xcite .    , normalized by the yield stress @xmath18 due only to capillary forces ( yield stress in the first regime ) as a function of the global crystallization index @xmath15 in experiments . the solid line corresponding to theoretical model ( see section 3 ) is plotted as a guide to eyes . ]",
    "the yield stress increases from @xmath19 due to the partial cementation of the first bonds at the boundary of the sample and the propagation of a solidification front towards the center of the sample .",
    "the yield stress increases rapidly in this regime .",
    "a photograph of the cementation front in a partially dried sample is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cementationfront ] .",
    "the bonds in the central part of the sample were of capillary type and thus the grains were easily removed .",
    "the remaining grains form a solid crown due to cemented bridges between the particles .",
    "hence , the thickness of this crown represents the distance run by the solidification front .",
    "it should be noted that the solid bonds behind this front are only partially cemented . at this stage , each solid bond is composed of a crystallized superficial layer with liquid brine inside .",
    "as drying continues , the cemented bond gets thicker and stronger until the whole bond solidifies .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deposition ] .        ]",
    "all bonds are cemented when the center of the sample is reached by the cementation front . in this third regime , @xmath14 rises linearly to a level as high as 35 times the capillary yield stress due to the consolidation of the cemented bonds throughout the system as a result of continued crystallization of the brine at each bond .",
    "these high values of compressive strength as @xmath20 has two different origins .",
    "on one hand , the debonding force of a solid nacl bond is nearly 7 times that of a capillary bond . on the other hand , unlike a liquid bond which involves only a tensile strength in addition to sliding friction , a solid bond has a rolling ( or bending ) strength as well as a tensile strength .",
    "this rolling strength is crucial for the compressive strength of cohesive granular materials @xcite .    ) .",
    "the error bars represent the standard deviation for five independent experiments .",
    "[ fig : ict_exp ] ]    figure [ fig : ict_exp ] shows the evolution of @xmath15 with time @xmath21 .",
    "this evolution reflects the kinetics of drying with the transport of water in the gas phase .",
    "@xmath15 begins to increase as soon as the sample is exposed , but the first partially cemented bonds are completely formed only at @xmath22 .",
    "then , @xmath15 increases mainly due to the formation of the first ( partially ) cemented bonds followed by the propagation of the cementation front into the sample .",
    "when this front reaches the center of the sample , @xmath15 increases only due to the aging and consolidation of the cemented bonds . although the kinetics of drying is not exactly the same in each regime , the time evolution of @xmath15 is quite well fit by an exponentially increasing function : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a characteristic drying time .",
    "this form suggests that the drying rate is proportional to the residual liquid .",
    "the evolution of the compressive strength may be understood on quantitative grounds by considering 1 ) a local cohesion law involving the phase change from liquid to solid at the level of a single bond , 2 ) the relation between the bond strength and the macroscopic strength , and 3 ) the kinetics of drying both at the surface and in the bulk . in the following ,",
    "we present a model that is based on these ingredients and correctly captures the macroscopic evolution as shown by the fitting form in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmayic_exp ] .",
    "the phase change of a bond from liquid to solid is controlled by the amount of the deposited solute .",
    "hence , the natural control parameter for phase transition at this scale is the bond crystallization index @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 this index depends on the history of the bond and is thus a function @xmath27 of the radial position @xmath28 of the bond and the time @xmath21 elapsed since the beginning of drying .",
    "we assume translational invariance along the axis of the sample .",
    "the index @xmath25 varies between @xmath29 for a liquid bond and @xmath30 for a fully cemented bond .",
    "the transition from liquid to solid takes place at a particular value @xmath31 which corresponds to the deposition of the first percolating shell of crystallized solute across the gap or at contact between two particles . in this transition ,",
    "the tensile force threshold @xmath32 ( the debonding force ) increases from that of a liquid bond @xmath33 to that of a fully cemented bond @xmath34 .",
    "we have @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 . assuming a linear evolution between these two limits , we get the following _ parametric _ adhesion law : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the heaviside step function . a plot of this relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parametriccohesion ] .        remark that @xmath32 in equation [ eqn : loi_evolutive ] is the force threshold and the actual value of the normal force @xmath41 depends on the force law expressing a force - displacement relation .",
    "this relation is different for a liquid bond and a partially or fully cemented bond .",
    "several expressions have been proposed for the capillary force @xmath42 as a function of the gap @xmath43 , bond liquid volume @xmath44 and surface tension @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the capillary force has its largest value at the contact between two particles and declines exponentially with the gap : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a characteristic length depending on @xmath44 and the particle radii , @xmath48 is a reduced length depending on the particle radii and @xmath49 is the contact angle @xcite .",
    "a capillary bridge is stable as long as @xmath50 given by @xcite @xmath51 this distance is small ( compared to @xmath47 ) in the pendular state and in practice the debonding force can be approximated by @xmath52 this force is independent of the bond liquid volume @xmath44 .",
    "the fully cemented bonds have a brittle behavior with a debonding threshold @xmath53 for the three values of @xmath17 used in our experiments .",
    "the behavior is also brittle for the partially cemented bonds with a threshold which is assumed here to vary linearly with the bond crystallization index according to equation [ eqn : loi_evolutive ] . obviously , the cemented bonds exhibit also a shear strength and a rolling strength in addition to the tensile strength considered above .",
    "this feature , which differentiates cemented bonds from liquid bonds , is not considered explicitly in the single - bond behavior but will be taken into account through a coulomb cohesion parameter @xmath54 at the macroscopic scale .      a schematic representation of our model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram_mod ] .",
    "it consists of two scales : 1 ) the microscopic or local scale is defined by the parametric adhesion law @xmath55 ; 2 ) the macroscopic or global scale is characterized by the relation @xmath56 .",
    "given the local adhesion law , the macroscopic behavior can be determined from the relationships between @xmath25 and @xmath15 , on one hand , and between @xmath32 and @xmath14 , on the other hand .",
    "we first consider a representative volume element ( rve ) .",
    "then , solve the problem in the presence of hydric gradients in the drying process by introducing a simple propagation equation for the local crystallization index .    ]",
    "we assume a homogeneous distribution of the liquid bonds in the initial preparation of the sample .",
    "we also assume that the total mass of nacl is the same for all bonds .",
    "then , the macroscopic crystallization index is simply the volume average of the bond crystallization index : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the height and radius of the sample , respectively , and @xmath60 is its volume .",
    "according to equation [ eqn : icic ] , for a rve and in the absence of hydric gradients , we have @xmath61 since all bonds reach simultaneously this point . during drying ,",
    "the cementation is initiated at the surface of the sample for @xmath62 and we have @xmath63 everywhere in the bulk .    in order to propose a relation between @xmath32 and @xmath14 , we need to postulate the deformation mechanism , the macroscopic failure mode and the general expression of the stress tensor in a granular material as a function of the bond forces .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath64 is the first moment of the bond forces @xmath65 averaged over the control volume @xmath66 @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number density of the bonds and @xmath69 is the @xmath70-component of the branch vector joining the centers of the two particles at contact .",
    "the averaging runs over all contacts belonging to the control volume . assuming that the branch vector lengths and forces are not correlated and for a medium with uniformly distributed branch vectors in all directions , the normal stress @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath41 is the normal bond force .",
    "we have @xmath73 as a result of the balance of force moments on each particle .    according to equation [ eqn : sigman ] , the maximum tensile force @xmath74 in a rve",
    "is obtained by replacing @xmath41 by @xmath32 : @xmath75 assuming that the mohr - coulomb failure criterion holds in the tensile regime , the coulomb cohesion @xmath54 is thus simply given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the friction coefficient and @xmath78 is the friction angle .    finally , we need the relation between the axial stress @xmath79 and the cohesion @xmath54 in order to evaluate the compressive strength . under the conditions of axial symmetry , we have @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 and @xmath82 be the mean stress and stress deviator , respectively . at failure , we have @xmath83 in our experiments the confining stress is zero : @xmath84 .",
    "hence , from equation ( [ eqn : qp ] ) , at failure we have @xmath85 finally , the substitution of @xmath54 from equation [ eqn : c ] yields @xmath86    equation ( [ eqn : sigmay ] ) shows that the compressive strength is proportional to the microscopic force threshold and to the number density of the bonds . notice that @xmath68 is simply half the average number of bonds per particle divided by the free volume , i.e. the mean volume @xmath87 of a voronoi cell surrounding the particle : @xmath88 by definition , given the solid fraction @xmath89 of the sample",

    "we first take the average of both sides of equation ( [ eqn : loi_evolutive ] ) : @xmath99 where the averaging runs over the whole sample . inserting this expression of the mean force threshold in equation ( [ eqn : sigmay2 ] ) , we get @xmath100    the average @xmath101 in the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn : sigmay3 ] ) depends on the function @xmath27 and will be evaluated below in the presence of a hydric gradient . here , we consider the first and third regimes identified in the experiments ( see section [ sec : experiments ] ) .",
    "the first regime corresponds to the initial stage of drying where @xmath102 for all bonds and no cemented bond is formed .",
    "hence , according to ( [ eqn : sigmay3 ] ) , the compressive strength in this regime is given by @xmath103 we see that @xmath14 in this regime is constant and independent of @xmath15 .",
    "the purely liquid - bond strength @xmath18 can be used to scale @xmath14 in equation ( [ eqn : sigmay3 ] ) : @xmath104    in the third regime , the cementation front has reached the center of the sample and we have @xmath105 , and thus @xmath106 everywhere . as a result , from equations ( [ eqn : icic ] ) and ( [ eqn : sigmay4 ] ) we get @xmath107 this equation shows that in the last stage of drying , corresponding to the consolidation of all bonds , the compressive strength increases linearly with @xmath15 . this linear behavior and the predicted value of the coefficient @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "are consistent with the data shown in fig .",

    "<S> we introduce a model based on a parametric cohesion law at the bonds and a bond crystallization parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this model predicts correctly the phase transition and the relation between microscopic and macroscopic cohesion .    </S>",
