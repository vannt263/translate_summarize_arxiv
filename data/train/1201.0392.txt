    "recently , it has been discussed that the hot and dense matter created in heavy ion collisions may form metastable domains where parity is locally violated .",
    "this possible local parity violation @xcite coupled with a strong magnetic field produced by passing nuclei in such a collision could cause a charge separation across the reaction plane in non - central collisions called the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite .",
    "one observable proposed to measure the cme is the three point correlator @xmath1 @xcite .    on the other hand , the balance functions ,",
    "which measure the correlation between the opposite sign charge pairs , are sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the balancing charges @xcite .",
    "the reaction - plane - dependent balance functions can be written as    @xmath2    here @xmath3 is the total number of positive(negative ) particles that have an azimuthal angle @xmath4 with respect to the event plane and @xmath5 represents the total number of pairs summed over all events where the first ( positive ) particle has an azimuthal angle @xmath4 with respect to event plane and the second ( negative ) particle has a relative azimuthal angle @xmath6 with respect to the first particle .",
    "similarly we can express @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the data used in this analysis are from au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 , 62.4 , 39 , 11.5 , and 7.7 gev taken by the star detector .",
    "a transverse momentum cut of @xmath10 gev/@xmath11 was applied as well as a pseudorapidity cut of @xmath12 .",
    "the second order event plane from tpc is used here and electrons are suppressed by specific energy loss inside the tpc .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : fig01 ] shows @xmath13 ( in - plane ) , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( out - of - plane ) balance function for 40 - 50% centrality only . the in - plane balance function is narrower than the out - of - plane balance function , which is caused by the strong collective flow in - plane ,",
    "the @xmath14 balance function is asymmetric and peaked at negative @xmath16 because charge pairs are more correlated on the in - plane side due to strong elliptic flow .",
    "also shown are the blast - wave model calculations from ref .",

    ", we also study the weighted average cosine , @xmath17 , and sine , @xmath18 , extracted from the balance functions .",
    "@xmath19    @xmath17 represents the width of balance function .",
    "if charges are created at the same point and do not diffuse due to strong collective flow , @xmath17 would be close to unity .",
    "@xmath18 is an odd function of @xmath6 , so it can quantify the asymmetry of the balance function .",

    "@xmath17 is closer to unity in the 0 - 5% centrality bin , which is due to a stronger collective flow in central collisions , while in mid - peripheral and peripheral collisions , @xmath17 shows a difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane balance functions , which is caused by stronger elliptic flow in the event plane .",

    "this smooth decrease is different from the cme expectation which predicts an increasing signal with decreasing beam energy and sharply disappearance of signal near the top energy of sps@xcite , but is consistent with the fact that @xmath24 decreases smoothly with beam energy in the same energy range .",
