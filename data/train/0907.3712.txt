    "there are many interesting questions to be answered in investigating exclusive electron scattering from the deuteron : what does the nuclear ground state look like at short distances , are there any six - quark contributions to the wave function , when does a description in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom break down ? in order to answer any of these questions ,",

    "the spin - dependent pieces in our fsi calculation were particularly relevant for the fifth response function , an observable that can be measured only with polarized electron beams .",
    "naturally , experiments with polarization of the target or ejectile are harder to perform than their unpolarized counterparts .",
    "however , the extra effort allows one to study otherwise inaccessible observables that are rather sensitive to certain properties of the nuclear ground state and the reaction mechanism . in this paper",

    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we establish the general formalism necessary to calculate response functions for polarized targets , and we discuss how to perform these calculations in two different coordinate systems .",
    "then , we continue with the calculation of asymmetries , and with the issues presented in using the experimental convention of measuring polarizations along the electron beam direction versus the theoretical choice of polarization axis along the three - momentum transfer @xmath4 . in the next section , we present our numerical results , in a kinematic region relevant to experiments at jefferson lab .",
