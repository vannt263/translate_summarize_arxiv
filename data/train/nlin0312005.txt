    "the paper concerns with the integrable discrete analogue of the following nonlinear partial differential equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a vector valued function of two variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 , comma denotes differentiation ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given functions of single arguments , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . the system was introduced long time ago by l.  bianchi  @xcite as an equation satisfied by a normal vector of special hyperbolic surfaces in @xmath11 ; here @xmath12 are the asymptotic coordinates of the surface .",
    "the second geometric interpretation of the bianchi system is given in terms of conjugate nets in @xmath11 permanent in deformation  @xcite .",
    "such nets can be equivalently characterized as conjugate nets with equal tangential invariants allowing for harmonic normal congruences  @xcite .",
    "the third and more recent geometric interpretation of the bianchi system follows from its equivalence ( with the signature of the scalar product changed to @xmath13 ) to the ernst - like reduction of einstein s equation describing the interaction of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "indeed , define  @xcite @xmath14 then the bianchi system is transformed into the equations @xmath15 which are the hyperbolic version of the ernst system describing axisymmetric stationary vacuum solutions of the einstein equations @xcite .    during the last few years the integrable discrete ( difference ) analogues of geometrically significant integrable differential equations have attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "the integrable discrete systems appear naturally in statistical physics @xcite and in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it has long been expected that a quantization of gravitational systems will lead to a discrete structure of space - time and then the differential equations must be replaced by difference equations at a fundamental level ( see recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "it would be therefore useful and instructive to study the geometric properties of integrable discrete version of the bianchi system , a distinctive integrable reduction of einstein s equations .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , in which the original paper @xcite of bianchi was discretized step by step , the following nonlinear vector equation @xmath16 was derived , in the context of asymptotic lattices , and identified as the proper integrable discrete analogue of the bianchi system . in equation ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are given functions , respectively , of the single arguments @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the subscripts in bracket denote shifts in the indexed variables , i.e. , for @xmath21 we write @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "it is remarkable that the same system had been already introduced , a bit earlier , in  @xcite , in the different geometric context of discrete isothermic nets , as an integrable discretization , instead , of the vectorial calapso equation .",
    "therefore the system can be viewed as a remarkable example in which discretization leads to a unification of different geometries and of different partial differential equations .",
    "equation can be obtained from the discrete moutard equation found in @xcite @xmath25 imposing the integrable quadratic constraint @xmath26 the integrability of the discrete bianchi system was proven in  @xcite and @xcite using different approaches , by showing the compatibility of the constraint with a suitable restriction of the darboux transformation of the discrete moutard equation .",
    "however the geometric meaning of the constraint was still unclear both in the context of discrete isothermic nets and in the context of discrete asymptotic nets .",
    "this situation seemed to be in contrast to the believe that geometry , and especially the discrete geometry , should help to understand integrability of the underlying systems .    in the present paper",
    "we obtain the integrable discrete analogue of the bianchi system in a geometric way . in order to keep track of integrability on each step of the construction",
    ", we make use of its geometric interpretation as the system describing _ conjugate nets with equal tangential invariants allowing for harmonic normal congruences _ @xcite .",
    "the main results of the paper can be stated as follows : i ) we have introduced the notion of _ dual koenigs lattice _ , the proper integrable discrete analogue of a conjugate net with equal tangential invariants ; ii ) we have introduced the notion of _ discrete normal congruence _ , the proper integrable discrete analogue of a normal congruence ; iii ) we have introduced the ( quadrilateral ) bianchi lattice as a _ dual koenigs lattice allowing for a harmonic congruence which is a discrete normal congruence_. because the simultaneous application of several integrable constraints preserves integrability , we obtain for free the integrability of the bianchi lattice . an additional result of the paper , relevant in deriving the above results , is the novel geometric characterization of the circular lattice as a quadrilateral lattice whose coordinate lines intersect orthogonally in the mean .",
    "it turns out that applying the above geometric constraints to the quadrilateral lattice one obtains @xmath27 which is simply related to equations - by @xmath28 in fact the system appeared first in a hidden form in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as a usefull tool to prove the integrability of equation .",
    "the program realized in this paper allows to embed yet another integrable discrete system into the general theory of lattices with planar quadrilaterals @xcite , which are the proper discrete analogues of conjugate nets .",
    "moreover , the paper confirms once more that , in the context of integrable geometries , the transition _ from differential to discrete _ , which is often highly nontrivial on the a level of the direct calculations , can be simplified and better understood on geometric level .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows .",
    "we start from section [ sec : omega ] , in which we present the integrable discrete analogues of nets with equal tangential invariants , combining the notion of dual lattice @xcite with the notion of koenigs lattice @xcite . in section [ sec : normal - cong ] we introduce and study the discrete normal congruences .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : bianchi ] we put all the above ingredients together to get the integrable discrete bianchi system .",
    "the appendix contains additional results of more algebraic nature stated in the language of partial difference equations . in its first part we present the algebraic version of the geometric characterization of circular lattices and normal congruences obtained in section  [ sec : normal - cong ] .",
    "the second part of the appendix contains the darboux transformation for the discrete bianchi system   written as a linear problem .",
    "we remark that , during the conference in which the geometric discretization described in this paper was presented , also the discretization of the notion of conjugate net invariant for deformation was presented @xcite .",
    "therefore two of the geometric meanings of the bianchi system seem to be now successfully discretized .",
    "as it was mentioned above , in the geometric derivation of the bianchi system   one combines the notion of the net with equal tangential invariants with the notion of the normal congruence .",
    "this section is devoted to the presentation of the integrable discrete analogue of the first component of the geometric definition of the bianchi system .",
    "we start with collecting some by now classical results from the theory of two dimensional quadrilateral lattices in three dimensional space @xcite , together with their tangential description @xcite , and from some recent results on the theory of koenigs lattices ( the discrete analogues of conjugate nets with equal point invariants )  @xcite .",
    "the integrable discrete analogues of conjugate nets are lattices made out of planar quadrilaterals @xcite , called in @xcite the quadrilateral lattices .",
    "given such a lattice @xmath29 , then , in terms of the homogeneous coordinates @xmath30 of the lattice , the planarity of the elementary quadrilaterals can be expressed as a linear relation between @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the generic situation , assumed in the sequel , in which three vertices of the elementary quadrilaterals are never collinear , the linear relation can be written down as the discrete laplace equation  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are real functions on @xmath39 .",
