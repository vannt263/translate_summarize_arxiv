    "this means that two states are linked by an off - diagonal matrix element of which the state with low number of excitations is _ higher _ in total energy than the state with a higher number of excitations .",
    "the increase of such a matrix element bears the risk that the unavoidable truncations imply a too severe approximation .",
    "the situation that the number of excitations is not correlated with the total energy can occur where the lower band edge of a continuum of more particles falls below the upper band edge of a continuum of less particles or below the dispersion of a single excitation , see , e.g. , ref .  .",

    "[ fig_sw]b , puts the presumption that such defects cause the peak at @xmath82 on a quantitative basis .",
