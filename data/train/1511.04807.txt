    "there is strong evidence that about 5 times more dark matter exists in the universe than ordinary matter . despite its prominence",
    ", we do not yet know what dark matter is @xcite . among many candidates for dark matter particles ,",
    "wimps are well motivated and have received the most attention to date .",
    "however , collider experiments at the lhc do not show any indication for such particles so far @xcite . and",
    "no experimental indication for a standard wimp was found in high sensitivity direct search experiments such as lux @xcite , xenon100 @xcite and supercdms @xcite either . on the other hand , that appears to contradict experiments that report signals interpreted as @xmath4 10 gev / c@xmath3 light wimp dark matter @xcite for many years . in this situation ,",
    "light mass wimps or other dark matter candidates are getting more attention .",
    "in fact , xmass , a high light yield and low background detector , probed this possibility and looked for signals not only from nuclear recoils but also from electrons and gamma rays emanating from interactions of other candidates such as axion - like particles , super - wimps and so on @xcite .",
    "the most significant result is that of the dama / libra experiment at the gran sasso national laboratory in italy which indicated an annual modulation signature @xcite .",
    "the earth s velocity relative to the dark matter distribution changes as the earth moves around the sun and produces such a modulation in the dark matter signal rate .",
    "this modulation can be observed with terrestrial detectors @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation can be changed from positive ( i.e. higher rate in june than in december ) to negative at cross - over energy @xcite and it is possible to observe this effect if the detector threshold is lower than that energy . for 100 gev / c@xmath3 wimp mass and a xe target ,",
    "this is about 20 kev nuclear recoil energy and it depends on the wimp mass and the target materials .",
    "the dama / libra experiment reported an observation of event rate annual modulation with a 9@xmath8 significance in 1.33 ton@xmath9year of data taken over 14 annual cycles with 100 to 250 kg of nai(tl ) detectors .",
    "their signal may be caused by light wimps , or other types of dark matter producing electrons or gamma rays .",
    "in such cases , the signal is not observable to direct search experiments if they remove electron events . in this situation ,",
    "dark matter models , for instance , with interaction via dark matter - electron scattering become well motivated which produce kev energy deposition in the detector because they provide a explanation for the dama / libra result while avoiding other direct detection constraints @xcite .",
    "recently , in addition to the wimp search result @xcite , an annual modulation search was carried out by the xenon group using only electronic recoil events in their two phase xe detector with the 34 kg fiducial volume in 224.6 live days data @xcite .",
    "the result disfavored the interpretation of the dama / libra as wimp - electron scattering through axial - vector coupling .",
    "xmass uses a single phase technology to observe only scintillation light by looking for both types of signals without any electric field .",
    "although xmass has a modest background rate like that of dama / libra , xmass has a larger mass of 832 kg of liquid xenon and , therefore , is able to reach the dama / libra exposure in short time .",
    "while the background in this recent modulation study by the xenon experiment is lower , xmass has a larger target mass and significantly longer exposure time . we will discuss the sensitivity later .",
    "note that xmass tests this modulation hypothesis with almost half the energy threshold ( @xmath4 1kev ) than theirs in a different environment and underground site .",
    "the xmass detector is located at the kamioka observatory ( overburden 2700 m.w.e ) in japan .",
    "the detailed design and performance are described in @xcite .",
    "the detector is immersed in a water tank , 10 m in diameter and 10.5 m in height , which is equipped with 72 hamamatsu h3600 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , and acts as an active muon veto and a passive radiation shield against neutrons and gamma rays from the surrounding rock .",
    "642 high quantum efficiency ( 28 - 40% at 175 nm ) hamamatsu r10789 pmts are mounted in the liquid xenon detector , an approximate sphere with an average radius of 40 cm .",
    "the gain of the pmts was monitored weekly with a blue led embedded in the inner surface of the detector .",
    "the scintillation light yield response was traced by inserting a @xmath10co source @xcite into the detector every one or two weeks .",
    "the number of events for each source position was about 20,000 . in november 2013 , after refurbishing the detector to reduce the radioactive background from the aluminum seal of the pmts window that was identified in the commissioning run @xcite , data taking was resumed with about one order of magnitude improved background by covering these seal parts with plates made of pure copper .",
    "the data accumulated between november 2013 and march 2015 were used for this analysis and we selected periods with stable temperature ( 172.6 - 173.0 k ) and pressure of xe ( 0.162 - 0.164 mpa absolute ) . after removing periods of operation with excessive pmt noise or data acquisition problems ,",
    "the total live time became 359.2 days .    in this paper ,",
    "two different energy scales were used : 1 ) kev@xmath11 represents an electron equivalent energy incorporating all the gamma - ray calibrations in the energy range between 5.9 kev and 122 kev from @xmath12fe , @xmath13cd , @xmath14am and @xmath10co sources by inserting sources into the sensitive volume of the detector .",
    "the non - linearity of energy scale was taken into account with those calibrations using a non - linearity model from doke et al .",
    "@xcite . below 5.9 kev , we extrapolated based on this model .",
    "we found about 15% energy scale difference from the noble element simulation technique ( nest ) @xcite at the threshold energy of 1.1 kev@xmath11 ( @xmath48 photoelectrons ) in this analysis .",
    "2 ) kev@xmath15 denotes the nuclear recoil energy which is estimated from the light yield at 122 kev by using non - linearity response measurement at zero electric field in @xcite .",
    "the energy threshold , in this case , corresponds to 4.8 kev@xmath15 .",
    "events with 4 or more pmt hits in a 200  ns coincidence timing window without a muon veto were initially selected . this resulted in 3.3@xmath16 events in the energy region between 1.1 and 15 kev@xmath17 . in order to avoid events caused by afterpulses of bright events induced by , for example , high energy gamma - rays or alpha particles , we rejected events occurring within 10 ms from the previous event and having a variance in their hit timings of greater than 100  ns ( this selection reduces the number of events to 2.8@xmath16 ) . a ` cherenkov cut ' removed events which produce light predominantly from cherenkov emission , in particular from the beta decays of @xmath18k in the pmt photocathode .",
    "events for which more than 60% of their pmt hits arrive in the first 20  ns were classified as cherenkov - like events @xcite ( this selection reduces the number of events to 1.9@xmath19 ) . finally , to remove background events that occurred in front of pmt window , we give upper limits on the values of ` max - photoelectron / total - photoelectron ' where max - photoelectron and total - photoelectron are the largest photoelectron counts in one pmt among all pmts and the total number of photoelectrons in the event , respectively ( this selection reduces the number of events to 3.6@xmath20 ) .",
    "these cut values varied as a function of photoelectron from about 0.2 at 8 photoelectrons to about 0.07 at 50 photoelectrons .",
    "the count rate for the data after all the cuts is 1.17 ( 0.028 ) events / day / kg / kev@xmath11 at 1.1 ( 5.0 ) kev@xmath11 .",
    "co 122 kev gamma ray source .",

    "the photoelectron yield during the data taking varied about 10% . the absorption and scattering length for the scintillation light as well as the intrinsic light yield of the liquid xenon scintillator",
    "are extracted from the @xmath10co calibration data the monte carlo simulation @xcite . with",
    "that we found that we can trace the observed photoelectron change in the calibration data as a change as the absorption length , while the scattering length remains stable at 52 cm with a standard deviation of @xmath24 .",
    "we then re - evaluate the absorption length and the relative intrinsic light yield to see the stability of the scintillation light response by fixing the scattering length at 52 cm . the absolute absorption length varied from about 4 m to 11 m , but",
    "the relative intrinsic light yield ( @xmath21 ) stayed within @xmath24 over the entire data taking period .",
    "the time dependence of the photoelectron yield affects the efficiency of the cuts .",
    "therefore , we evaluate the absorption length dependence of the relative cut efficiencies through monte carlo simulation . if we normalize the overall efficiency at an absorption length of 8 m , this efficiency changes from @xmath254% to + 2% over the relevant absorption range .",
    "the position dependence of the efficiency was taken into account as a correlated systematic error ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is the dominant systematic uncertainty in the present analysis .",
    "the second largest contribution comes from a gain instability of the waveform digitizers ( caen v1751 ) between april 2014 and september 2014 due to a different calibration method of the digitizers used in that period .",
    "this effect contributes an uncertainty of 0.3% to the energy scale .",

    "the data set was divided into 40 time - bins ( @xmath29 ) with roughly 10 days of live time each .",
    "the data in each time - bin were then further divided into energy - bins ( @xmath30 ) with a width of 0.5 kev@xmath11 .",
    "two fitting methods were performed independently .",
    "both of them fit all energy- and time - bins simultaneously .",

    "@xmath40 represents the 1@xmath8 correlated systematic error on the expected event rate based on the relative cut efficiency in that bin .",

    "hereafter we call the former case the wimp analysis and the latter a model independent analysis .    in the case of the wimp analysis , the expected modulation amplitudes become a function of the wimp mass @xmath47 as the wimp mass @xmath48 determines the recoil energy spectrum",
