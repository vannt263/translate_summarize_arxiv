    "rocked ratchets with massive particles exhibit strong inertial effects capable of reversing their current @xcite .",

    "the dynamics of a massive particle in a cosine potential was reproduced in terms of a `` climbing - sine map '' @xcite : running orbits , relevant to the rectification mechanism in a ratchet , can be either periodic or diffusive , depending on the value of the map control parameter ( viz . the amplitude of the sine term ) .",
    "the phase - space portrait of the actual damped - driven pendulum was computed by huberman _",
    "@xcite , who revealed the existence of _ delocalized _ strange attractors with an intricate structure on all scale , later recognized to be fractal objects @xcite .    in this article",

    "@xcite holds good , deep into the underdamped regime @xmath5 .",
    "the adiabatic condition @xmath6 imposed here , has not been addressed in the damped - driven pendulum literature , but is believed to maximize transport in biological systems @xcite and josephson junction arrays @xcite , among others . on decreasing @xmath7 we noticed that ( a ) the rectification efficiency of an inertial ratchet increases inversely proportional to @xmath7 according to a scaling current - amplitude @xmath8-@xmath9 curve ; ( b ) below a critical @xmath7 value , more @xmath8-@xmath9 curves coexist , thus signaling the appearance of regular trajectories with higher periodicity ; ( c ) on further decreasing @xmath7 , all trajectories develop a finite _ diffusion _ coefficient and the ratchet current drops monotonically toward zero .",

    "type @xmath60 trajectories with @xmath78 are hardly detectable ; moreover , these different behaviors turned out to be insensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "the onset of diffusive transport is a main feature of inertial ratchets @xcite .",
    "although an analytical estimate of the diffusion coefficient @xmath75 lies beyond the grasp of our theoretical tools a simple relationship between drift and diffusion of a ratchet ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) in the fully chaotic regime can be easily established .",
