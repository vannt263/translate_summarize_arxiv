    "the class of pulsating stars known as rr lyrae variables are located at the intersection of the instability strip and the horizontal branch in the hertzsprung russell diagram .",
    "their utility has been widely documented in the literature . as such",
    ", they can be referred to as the  swiss army knife \" of astronomy .    because of their low masses ( @xmath00.7 m@xmath1 , smith 1995 ) , the mere presence of rr lyrae stars in a stellar population suggests an old age ( @xmath210 gyr ) for the system . as such , one does not need to obtain deep photometry beyond the old main sequence turnoff in order to establish the presence of an old population . generally speaking , _ identifying _ rr lyrae stars",
    "does not require a substantial investment of telescope time .",
    "the periods of the ab - type rr lyrae stars are related to their metallicities .",
    "these variables pulsate in the fundamental mode and display a distinctive sawtooth appearance in their light curves . using data on field rr lyraes from layden ( 2005 , private communication ) , sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found @xmath3 = -3.43 - 7.82~log~p_{ab}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dispersion in this relation ( rms = 0.45 dex ) is significant making the determination of individual stellar metallicities unreliable , but the relation is useful for estimating the mean abundance of a population of rr lyraes .",
    "there is a more precise relation given by alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that requires knowledge of the periods _ and _ amplitudes ; with this relation , the error per star is reduced to @xmath00.31 dex and the precision of the resulting abundance distribution is narrower ( sarajedini et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "once the metallicities of the rr lyraes are determined , their absolute magnitudes can be calculated .",
    "the published equations typically take the form of a linear relation between [ fe / h ] and m@xmath4(rr ) .",
    "a number of different slopes and zeropoints have been derived for this equation , but there seems to be convergence on slope values of @xmath00.20 and zeropoints of @xmath00.90 ( chaboyer 1999 , gratton et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ; dotter et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the minimum light colors of ab - type rr lyraes are largely independent of their other properties as shown by guldenschuh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and kunder et al .",
    "this is based on a concept originally developed by sturch ( 1966 ) . as a result ,",
    "if the minimum light colors are well - determined , they can be compared with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    ", rr lyrae variables are powerful probes of the systems in which they reside - star clusters or among the field populations of galaxies .",
    "it is for this reason that studying them in the local group late - type spiral galaxy m33 provides valuable insights into the properties of this galaxy . ultimately , we would like to know how ` dwarf spirals ' like m33 fit into the process of galaxy formation in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) with a cosmological constant @xmath7 ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 )",
    ". comprehensive knowledge of m33 s most ancient stars will shed light on this question . in the remainder of this contribution",
    ", we will describe how rr lyrae stars have been used to this end .",
    "the history of rr lyrae studies in m33 is relatively short .",
    "the earliest study is that of pritchet ( 1988 ) , who presented preliminary results for a handful of such stars .",
    "no data or light curves were shown , but pritchet ( 1988 ) did estimate a distance of ( m  m)@xmath8 = 24.45 @xmath9 0.2 for m33 based on the rr lyrae variables .",
    "this value is somewhat smaller than the average of several different determinations from galleti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) of ( m  m)@xmath8 = 24.69 @xmath9 0.11 .",
    "the first study to unequivocally identify and characterize rr lyraes in m33 was that of sarajedini et al .",
    "they used time - series observations of two fields in m33 taken with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs / wfc ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the observations consisted of 8 epochs in the f606w ( @xmath0v ) filter and 16 epochs in the f814w ( @xmath0i ) filter .",
    "the data were analyzed using the template - fitting software developed by andrew layden and described in layden & sarajedini ( 2000 , see also mancone & sarajedini 2008 ) . based on these data , 64 ab - type rr lyraes were identified . however , very few c - type variables were uncovered because of their generally lower amplitude .",
    "the period distribution of the ab - type variables showed two peaks - one at longer periods which resembles the metal - poor rr lyraes in m3 and m31 ( brown et al .",
    "2004 ) and one at shorter periods which could be from metal - rich rr lyraes in m33 s disk .",
    "the presence of the latter population is somewhat uncertain given the recent work of pritzl et al .",
    "( private communication ) .",
    "sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found the mean metallicity of the metal - poor rr lyraes to be consistent with that of halo globular clusters in m33 which have @xmath10[fe / h]@xmath11 = 1.27 @xmath9 0.11 ( sarajedini et al . 2000 ) .",
    "figure 12 of sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) shows that the m33 rr lyraes are in their expected location in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ; in addition , their colors exhibit a dispersion that is consistent with being significantly affected by differential reddening .",
    "this suggests that some of the rr lyraes are on the near side of m33 while others are in the disk or on the far side of the galaxy .",
    "one way to further investigate this possibility is to examine the distribution of rr lyrae reddenings using the intrinsic minimum light color of the ab - types as mentioned in sec .",
    "this analysis was performed by sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and shows that the rr lyraes span the range from e(v ",
    "i)@xmath120.1 up to e(v  i)@xmath00.7 .",
    "given that the line - of - sight reddening to m33 is e(v  i)@xmath00.1 , this suggests that rr lyraes exist in the disk of m33 and in its halo ( on the near and far side ) .",
    "we return to this point later as we discuss the most recent results on rr lyraes in m33 .    the primary result from the work of sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) was that m33 does indeed contain rr lyrae variables in its halo .",
    "this suggests that the halo of m33 contains some fraction of stars with ages older than @xmath010 gyr . in this regard ,",
    "the halos of m33 , m31 , and the milky way are similar .",
    "it seems that they started forming stars at about the same time .",
    "building upon the work of sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , yang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) present an analysis of new hst / acs / wfc imaging that is part of program go-10190 .",
    "the primary aim of this program is to study the star formation of the disk of m33 ( williams et al .",
    "2009 ) . as such",
    ", fields were obtained at four different disk locations roughly equally spaced along the major axis of m33 .",
    "figure 1 of san roman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) shows the locations of the disk fields .",
    "here we report on the properties of the rr lyraes in the second closest field to the center of the m33 , which we designate disk2 .",
    "the observations are composed of 16 epochs in the f606w filter and 22 in the f814w filter spanning a time window of @xmath03 days .",
    "template - fitting analysis suggests the presence of 86 rr lyraes in this field - 65 ab - type , 18 c - type , and 3 d - type variables .",
    "figure 1 shows a montage of some of the light curves .",
    "the upper panel of figure 2 shows the cmd of disk2 along with the locations of the rr lyraes .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "2 displays the distribution in color of the ab - type rr lyraes revealing the presence of two peaks - a primary peak at ( v  i)@xmath00.5 and a secondary one at ( v  i)@xmath00.8 .",
    "we would like to know if this bimodality is due to reddening internal to m33 .",
    "as such , we determine the reddening of each rr lyrae using sturch s method as described in sec . 1 and then examine the distribution of reddenings to see if the fainter / redder rr lyraes , those with ( v  i)@xmath130.74 , do indeed suffer from higher reddening",
    ". the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 illustrates this effect .",
    "the thin solid histogram represents all ab - type rr lyraes while the dotted histogram shows only those with ( v  i)@xmath130.74 ( dashed line in the middle panel ) .",
    "our hypothesis seems to be correct - that the fainter / redder rr lyraes are being affected by extinction internal to m33 .",
    "this suggests that the variables near ( v  i)@xmath00.5 are on the near side of m33 while those with ( v  i)@xmath00.8 are in the disk or on the far side .",
    "we now seek to compare the properties of the low reddening and high reddening rr lyraes .",
    "in particular , how do they compare in the bailey diagram ?",
    "this is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "3 where we plot the periods and amplitudes of the disk2 rr lyraes ( open circles - ab - types , open triangles - c - types ; filled squares - d - types ; filled circles - higher reddening ab - types ) .",
    "these are compared with the oosterhoff i and ii loci from clement & rowe ( 2000 ) .",
    "we see that the ab - type rr lyraes in m33 ( both the low reddening and higher reddening samples ) are consistent with those in oosterhoff i galactic globular clusters .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 shows the period distribution of the rr lyraes - the thin solid line represents all of these stars while the dotted line shows the higher reddening rr lyraes . when compared to the period distribution of the low reddening variables , those with higher reddening exhibit no significant difference in their mean periods .",
    "this suggests that the mean metallicities of these samples are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "this reinforces the assertion that the low reddening rr lyraes as well as most of those that suffer from higher reddening are likely to be in the halo of m33 .",
    "studies of rr lyrae variables in the late - type spiral galaxy m33 are still in their infancy but there are a few points we can make with relative certainty .",
    "first , m33 does indeed harbor rr lyrae variables in its halo , which suggests that , similar to m31 and the milky way , there is an old component ( @xmath210 gyr ) to the halo of this galaxy .",
    "these variables have pulsational properties that are consistent with those in oosterhoff i galactic globular clusters .",
    "furthermore , their mean metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.4 , which is consistent with the mean abundance of halo globular clusters in m33 .",
    "much more work is left to be done .",
    "for example , wide - field time - domain surveys of m33 will reveal the spatial distribution of the rr lyraes .",
    "the capabilities of 30 m telescopes will likely allow us to obtain kinematic and abundance information for rr lyraes in m33 .",
    "we can then study the detailed properties of the earliest epochs of star formation in a late type spiral galaxy .",
    "this has implications for how such galaxies fit into the @xmath7cdm paradigm for structure formation in the early universe .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledges the work of a number of close collaborators that have contributed results to this review .",
    "the template - fitting code we use originated with andy layden and has been integrated into our fitlc software by university of florida graduate student conor mancone . this manuscript has benefited greatly from a careful reading by karen kinemuchi .",
    "much of this work has been supported by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
