    "a mesoscopic system has two distinctive characteristics :    * it contains many more particles than a microscopic system , but is small enough for us to manipulate in the laboratory . *",
    "it possesses a quantum phase that we can control .",
    "the term `` mesoscopic '' has been associated with `` quantum dots , '' in which the passage of electrons can be controlled singly .",
    "now we have new mesoscopic systems , with the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in a system of trapped atoms .",
    "these bose condensates typically contain the order of 10@xmath0 atoms , in a magnetic or optical trap , at a temperature of the order of 10@xmath1k .",
    "after a brief summary of known facts , we shall give examples of both aspects mentioned above .",
    "for more details and literature , we refer to recent review papers on experiments  @xcite and theory  @xcite .",
    "as we know , there are two types of elementary particles : fermions of half - integer spin , which can not occupy the same state , and boson of integer spin , which love to be in the same state",
    ". bound states of elementary particles , such as atoms and molecules , also fall into these categories .",
    "the bosonic atoms we are dealing with include @xmath2rb , @xmath3na , @xmath4li , and atomic hydrogen .    in the ground states all bosonic atoms",
    "occupy the same state ; forming the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "what makes this an identifiable entity is its stability , arising from the quantum - mechanical fact that atoms are indistinguishable . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we illustrate how this reduces the number of excited states .",
    "the situations illustrated would represent three different states , if the particles were distinguishable .",
    "but for indistinguishable particles they are one and same the same state . because of this , there are fewer ways to excite the condensate , and hence it has a high degree of stability .",
    "@xmath5    in fact , when the temperature is raised from absolute zero , there remains a finite fraction of particles in the condensate .",
    "the condensate fraction decreases with rising temperature , and disappears only above a finite temperature @xmath6 , the critical temperature of the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "in contrast , for `` boltzmann statistics '' , the ground state wave function is the same , but there will be a high density of excited states . in this case , no condensate exists at any finite temperature .",
    "that is , the transition temperature is at absolute zero .",
    "the process of bose - einstein condensation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .",
    "the process to achieve bec in the laboratory is illustrated in fig .",
    "an atomic beam was slowed down by laser cooling , and a magnetic trap was turned on .",
    "@xmath8    the spin up atoms are confined , while the spin down one are expelled .",
    "final cooling is achieved through evaporation and rethermalization . to evaporate the fast atoms , rf light of appropriate frequency is turned on to induce spin flip . in the final condensate",
    ", we have typically @xmath9 the density is some seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of air in the atmosphere .",
    "a brief history of bose - einstein condensation in trapped gases is given fig .",
    "[ f4 ] .",
    "long before trapped atoms , of course , bose - einstein condensation had been seen , though indirectly , in the superfluidity of liquid @xmath11he .",
    "andronikashvili performed the classic experiment on the superfluid fraction , by measuring the moment of inertia of a stack of rotating plates immersed in liquid helium , as a function of temperature .",
    "the idea was that the normal fluid would be dragged into rotation with the plates , but the superfluid component would not participate in the motion .",
    "the ultimate miniaturization of the andronikashvili experiment has now been done  @xcite in @xmath11he clusters of a few hundred atoms , with the rotating plates replaced by a rotating atom of @xmath12he .",
    "superfluidity was reported in a cluster with 60 atoms .",
    "this is a very interesting mesoscopic system , but beyond the scope of our discussion here .",
    "for an ideal bose gas , the condensate is made up of particles in the same single - particle quantum state .",
    "when there are interparticle interactions , single - particle states are no longer meaningful ; but we can define the condensate wave function as the quantum amplitude for removing a particle from the ground state : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the condensate density , and @xmath15 is the quantum phase of the condensate .    the quantum coherence of the condensate is a remarkable thing . in experimental traps , the condensate can have a spatial extension as large as @xmath16 mm , which is almost visible to the naked eye , and yet this glob of matter is characterized by a single wave function , with a single phase .",
    "this has been demonstrated experimentally by switching off the magnetic trap , cutting the condensate in half with a laser `` knife , '' and allowing the two halves to fall under gravity .",
    "the two condensates expand as they drop , and eventual overlap in space , creating a interference pattern , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . an actual photograph of the interference fringes in shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] .",
    "@xmath17    @xmath18    we can describe two non - overlapping free condensates by wave functions that are nearly plane waves : @xmath19 when they overlap , they become one condensate with wave function @xmath20 the density of the system is given by @xmath21\\ ] ] where the last term exhibits the interference fringes . from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , the fringe spacing gives a half wavelength @xmath2215 @xmath23 m , which corresponds to a relative wave number @xmath24 the relative velocity of the two condensates was therefore given by @xmath25    atoms in the condensate in a magnetic trap can be ejected by inducing spin flips , through application of rf light .",
    "the expelled atoms fall under gravity as pulses of coherent matter , as shown in fig .",
    "this is the first example of an atom laser  @xcite .",
    "the condensate wave function satisfies a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , also called the gross - pitaveskii equation , in a mean - field approximation that neglects the coupling to the thermal cloud : @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the s - wave scattering length . the normalization condition @xmath30 determines the number of particles in the condensate .",
    "this is a constant of the motion , but its value can not be changed by convention , contrary to that for an ordinary wave function , because the equation is nonlinear .",
    "the scattering length @xmath29 is illustrated in fig .",
    "the reduced relative wave function of two atoms , as a function of the separation @xmath31 , approaches a linear asymptote beyond the range of the potential .",
    "the scattering length is the the intercept of the asymptote on the @xmath31 axis .",
    "@xmath32    when the potential has no bound state , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , a repulsive potential give @xmath33 , and an attractive potential give @xmath34 .",
    "when there are bound states in a attractive potential , however , the scattering length can have either sign .",
    "as the potential gets more attractive , it changes sign whenever a bound state occurs .",
    "@xmath35    one of the exciting recent developments is that the scattering length can be tuned , from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , by changing an external magnetic field , through the feshbach resonance in atomic scattering , which is similar to a bound state  @xcite .",
    "this realizes the usual thought experiment of changing the coupling constant in the hamiltonian .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath29 is a parameter that describes scattering in 3d in the limit of zero energy , where the shape of the potential is irrelevant . at higher energies ,",
    "the shape of the potential does make a difference , and one must include other parameters , such as the effective range  @xcite .",
    "the trapped atoms that form a bose condensate at such low temperatures would have solidified in free space . in the trap ,",
    "the zero - point motion kept them apart . in the case of @xmath0li , which has negative scattering length , the condensate is metastable , and decays via quantum tunneling , if the total number of atoms @xmath38 is sufficiently small . if @xmath38 exceeded a critical number , however , the system collapses  @xcite .",
    "let us discuss each of these scenarios .    for negative scattering length , we have @xmath39 .",
    "let us denote @xmath40 we can see qualitatively that in free space the condensate collapses in spatial dimension @xmath41 .",
    "the energy density of system is @xmath42 suppose the system is confined to a region of dimension @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath44 , so @xmath45 thus @xmath46 when @xmath47 , if @xmath41 .",
    "if there is a confining potential , then collapse happens only if @xmath38 is sufficiently large , because there is a potential barrier against collapse . to see this ,",
    "consider the hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ nlse ] ) : @xmath48=\\int d^{3}r\\left [   -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\psi^{\\ast}\\nabla^{2 } \\psi+v(r)\\psi^{\\ast}\\psi-\\frac{g}{2}(\\psi^{\\ast}\\psi)^{2}\\right]\\ ] ] and choose a harmonic oscillator potential @xmath49    for qualitative arguments , let us consider a confined wave function of a gaussian shape @xmath50 where @xmath51 the parameter @xmath52 describes the width of the gaussian .",
    "a gaussian narrower than the harmonic oscillator wave function corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "we can then replace @xmath54 , where @xmath55\\ ] ] thus the hamiltonian can be represented in the form @xmath48=\\int d^{3}r\\omega_{r}(\\psi)\\ ] ] where the `` field potential '' @xmath56 is given by @xmath57   |\\psi|^{2}-\\frac{g}{2}|\\psi|^{4}\\ ] ] this potential is plotted as a function of @xmath58 for different @xmath59 in the right panel of fig .",
    "there is an energy barrier with height @xmath60   ^{2}\\ ] ] which is nonzero at @xmath61 , because @xmath62 . at large @xmath58",
    "the field potential tends to @xmath36 . in reality , of course , the nlse ceases to be valid somewhere along the drop , for other physical effects , such as solidification , come in .",
    "@xmath63    a typical initial wave function @xmath64 is shown on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f10 ] . at a given @xmath31",
    ", we can measure the wave function on the left panel , and transfer it to the horizontal axis on the right panel .",
    "if it lands to the left of the barrier maximum for the particular @xmath65 then the system at that point is classically stable , but can decay via quantum tunneling as indicated by the classically forbidden path @xmath66 . if it lands to the right , the system at that @xmath31 will rapidly collapse to a state of high density .",
    "since @xmath64 has a maximum at @xmath61 with value proportional to @xmath67 , the system will decays local tunneling , if it is classically stable at @xmath61 .",
    "otherwise , the system in a region about @xmath61 will rapidly collapse .",
    "the condition for stability against collapse is therefore @xmath68 within the gaussian assumption , this corresponds to @xmath69 , with @xmath70 in the experiments with @xmath4li at rice university  @xcite , the parameters are @xmath71 with the choice @xmath72 ( see later ) , we obtain @xmath73 from ( [ nc ] ) .    for @xmath69",
    ", the condensate decays slowly via quantum tunneling , as indicate by the path @xmath66 in fig .",
    "since the tunneling path depends on @xmath31 , the tunneling is a local phenomenon , proceeding at different rates at different distances from the center of the trap .",
    "it should be noted that quantum tunneling is a phenomenon not included in the nlse , which is a classical approximation .",
    "the tunneling probability can be calculated via a feynman path integral , and in a wkb - type approximation can be obtained by solving the nlse in imaginary time  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , we can describe the phenomenon as follows .",
    "the condensate locally makes a quantum transition from a low - density state @xmath74 to a high - density state @xmath75 .",
    "the time at which this happens is random , and follows a statistical distribution .",
    "since the total number of particles is conserved , what we see is that high - density droplets would `` ooze out '' of the condensate , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] . once form",
    ", the droplets will tend to contract to states of even higher density , and will leave the trap through effects not included in our hamiltonian , such as spin - flip scattering .",
    "@xmath76    a more rigorous treatment of the field potential , independent of the gaussian assumption , may be modeled after that of the `` effective potential '' in quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , unless @xmath77 , the tunneling probability is very small . in reality",
    ", it would be masked by the decay of the condensate through spin - flip scattering , an effect that we have not taken into account .",
    "when @xmath78 , the condensate with negative scattering length collapses . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ f10 ] , the collapse does not happen all at once over the entire condensate , but begins at the center of the condensate , where the density is highest .",
    "a black hole opens up at the center , in which , theoretically according to the nlse , the density fluctuations becomes infinite , and the pressure becomes negative  @xcite .",
    "numerical solutions of the nlse have been obtained  @xcite , with the perimeters ( [ param ] ) . after the condensate was created in some arbitrary state ,",
    "the wave function quickly adjusted itself to a gaussian - like quasi - stationary state , with a width corresponding to @xmath72 .",
    "this situation persists infinitely if @xmath38 is sufficiently small .",
    "@xmath79    if @xmath38 is larger than a critical value , then the quasi - stationary states lasts for a time , but then suddenly a finite volume about the center implodes , creating a black hole .",
    "thereafter , waves of implosion arrives from all over the condensate , whose density now appears to be turbulent .",
    "these features are summarized in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] , where @xmath80 is plotted as a function of @xmath31 in unit of @xmath81 , and @xmath82 in unit of 2@xmath83 , for a fixed @xmath38 . by decreasing @xmath38 until the time of collapse goes to infinity , it was found that @xmath84    in the experimental situation , the condensate in the trap can exchange atoms with an uncondensed thermal cloud , which contains far more atoms than the condensate .",
    "equilibrium is reached when the chemical potentials equalize .",
    "the atoms can be depleted through two and three - body spin - flip collisions , and the latter becomes especially important where the density becomes large .",
    "these gain and loss mechanisms can be simulated by adding extra pure - imaginary terms to the nlse , with a linear gain term , and a loss term proportional to @xmath85 with these additions , the system settles down to steady state in which @xmath38 oscillates in growth - collapse cycles , as shown in fig .",
    "again , we obtain @xmath73 .    @xmath86",
    "a spatial variation of the phase @xmath15 of the condensate wave function gives rise to a superfluid velocity @xmath87 and a supercurrent density @xmath88 thus , flow patterns in the condensate can be created by `` phase engineering . ''",
    "this has been done to create vortices  @xcite and solitons  @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional solitons have been used in optical fibers for signal transmission over thousands of kilometers , with minimal loss .",
    "the electromagnetic field in an optical fiber obeys a nlse of the same form as ( [ nlse ] )  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to wonder whether we can create solitons in a 1d condensate . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f14 ] , the nonlinear term @xmath89 represents an effective potential , which is attractive for @xmath39 , and repulsive for @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath39as we saw earlier , the case does not lead to collapse in 1d . in this case , a localized wave packet created a attractive well of the same shape , hence it would trap itself into a bright soliton . in the case @xmath90 , on the other hand , a `` kink '' configuration would self - trap , giving rise to a dark soliton .",
    "@xmath91    consider now a ring - shaped condensate .",
    "if the radius of the ring is much larger than the radius of the cross section , then we can regard the system as one - dimensional , in the sense that transverse excitations have a much high energy than the logitudinal ones , and may be ignored at low temperatures .",
    "however , the cross sectional radius may still be large compared to the scattering length , so that the system is still 3d with respect to interatomic scattering .",
    "we concentrate on the repulsive case with @xmath90 .",
    "the solution to the nlse must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the angle around the ring .",
    "let us write @xmath94 for a kink soliton , @xmath95 must have a zero , and so changes sign when @xmath93 increases by 2@xmath96 . to satisfy the boundary condition ,",
    "the phase must change by an odd multiple of @xmath96 in one complete revolution .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to a change of @xmath96 in the phase .",
    "this means that the lowest kink soliton has angular momentum per particle @xmath97 for the same mathematical reason that an electron has spin 1/2 .",
    "the solution can be obtained analytically  @xcite .",
    "the phase changes most rapidly at the location of the kink , and its slope there gives the kink a nonzero propagation velocity .",
    "thus , the soliton is manifested as a dark spot moving around the ring with a characteristic velocity .",
    "the width of the soliton turns out to be proportional to @xmath98 , where @xmath38 is the number of atoms in the condensate .",
    "the first atom laser illustrated in fig .  [ f7 ] consists of pulses of coherent atoms . however , the different pulses do not have definite phase with respect to each other .",
    "there is an advantage to have a mode - locked laser  one in which the output pulses are phase coherent . in more recent experiments , a steady stream of output pulses has been achieved  @xcite , but it is not clear whether the pulses are coherent with respect to each other .",
    "we can use of our kink soliton to make a mode - locked atom laser  @xcite .",
    "the physics is illustrated in fig .",
    "the ring of condensate is surround by a thermal cloud , which tends to maintain an equilibrium number of particles @xmath38 in the ring .",
    "now suppose we use some stroboscopic device to take particles out the soliton , by enlarging its width , which is proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "then particles will flow from the thermal cloud to the condensate to restore @xmath38 , and thus restoring the width .",
    "an important question is how to create the kink soliton , and whether it is robust against perturbations . in a simulation ,",
    "the soliton was created by applying a moving momentary repulsive potential , such as that created by a laser beam , to create a hole in the condensate that moves at the characteristic soliton speed .",
    "this hole develops into the kink soliton , plus all kinds of excitations such as sound waves . to clean up the configuration , a periodic loss mechanism was introduced , in the form of am imaginary stroboscopic potential that also acts as outcoupler . at the same time , a gain mechanism was put in to simulate the thermal cloud .",
    "all unwanted excitations rapidly disappeared , leaving the kink soliton in steady - state equilibrium .",
    "the stability of the soliton come from topology  the fact that it has half - integer angular momentum per particle .",
    "the creation and stabilization of the soliton is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f16 ] , where @xmath58 is plotted as a function of @xmath93 and @xmath82 , with a contour plot projected onto the @xmath93-@xmath82 plane .",
    "the fact that we have in fact a kink soliton is indicted in fig .",
    "[ f17 ] , where the angular momentum per particle is plotted as a function of time .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ f18 ] shows the oscillation of the number of particles in the ring .",
