    "characterizing the evolution of a crystal surface is a worthy goal given the importance of crystal films in many modern electronic devices ( e.g. mobile phone antennae ) . in this paper",
    "we explore the evolution of a family of very simple atomistic models of crystal evolution in certain macroscopic scaling limits .",
    "the family of atomistic models includes the well known solid - on - solid ( sos ) model @xcite and is remarkable , given its simplicity , for its close relation to models in widespread use in large scale simulations of crystal evolution ( see e.g. @xcite for recent studies ) .",
    "while the large scale and qualitative properties of mesoscopic , ordinary differential equation ( ode ) models for terraced crystal surfaces , have been studied by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) , similar investigations of microscopic , kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) models seem less common .",
    "a notable exception is the paper by krug , dobbs , and majaniemi , @xcite , on the continuum ( large crystal ) limit of the sos model in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the present work is motivated by that study . for a study of the relationship between kmc models and ode models of terraced surfaces",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite give informal arguments suggesting a partial differential equation ( pde ) governing the evolution of the sos model in the continuum limit .",
    "we provide a different informal ( if slightly less so ) argument justifying the same limiting equation as well as provide more extensive numerical supporting evidence .",
    "arguments in the last section of @xcite actually suggest an alternative , and very different , pde limit for the sos model .",
    "this pde has an unusual exponential nonlinearity .",
    "we show that a pde with a very similar ( but not the same ) exponential non - linearity can be derived in a particular , non - standard , macroscopic scaling limit .",
    "our informal argument in this scaling regime is similar to the argument in the standard regime and is again bolstered by numerical simulations .",
    "the two pde are roughly consistent in an appropriate asymptotic sense .",
    "in addition to the two pde identified in @xcite , haselwandter and vvedensky , in @xcite , suggest another pde for the macroscopic dynamics , albeit in a slightly different limit .",
    "the goal of this paper is to , through a careful numerical and theoretical investigation , clearly identify the correct pde limits and how they arise in different limiting regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : background ] and [ sec : micro ] , we describe in detail the family of atomistic models that we consider . in section [ sec : pdelimits ] we present the relevant pde limits along with their similarities and differences to results in the literature . in section [ s : numerics ] we give numerical evidence supporting our claims .",
    "lastly , we offer our ( informal ) derivation of the pde limits in section [ sec : pdeder ] .      the authors wish to thank robert v. kohn , dionisios margetis , peter smereka , and herbert spohn for helpful discussions throughout the preparation of this work as well as sandeep sarangi from unc computing for assistance with running simulations on the unc _ killdevil _ cluster .",
    "peter smereka brought reference @xcite to our attention and was particularly instrumental in the formulation of this project .",
    "was partially supported by an nsf postdoc and an ibm junior faculty development award .",
    "he in addition acknowledges the courant institute and the university of chicago for their gracious hosting during parts of this work .",
    "jw was supported by the nsf through award dms-1109731 .",
    "the evolution of a crystal is most naturally ( and most accurately ) captured by ab - initio molecular simulation , i.e. by resolving the fluctuations and bond breaking / formation events of the entire crystal .",
    "unfortunately such simulations are not practical at large scales . if we imagine that the evolution of the crystal surface proceeds by rare ( on the time scale of atomistic fluctuations ) `` hopping '' events in which an atom breaks the bonds with its neighbors and moves from one position on a crystal lattice to a nearby position then it is reasonable to attempt to resolve only the presence or absence of an atom at each lattice position .",
    "the family of microscopic models that we consider here takes this one step further , only describing the evolution of the surface of the crystal and ignoring important features such as vacancies , dislocations , and substrate interaction .    despite their deficiencies , versions of these so - called broken - bond models",
    "have found widespread use in large scale simulation and , as we will see , their relative simplicity makes them amenable to analysis . in @xcite",
    "the authors considered the macroscopic evolution of a model nearly identical to the one we will soon describe in detail .",
    "that paper serves as the motivation for the current work .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggest that , appropriately rescaled , the evolution of the surface height of a large crystal in @xmath0 dimensions ( one spatial and one time dimension ) can be described by the partial differential equation @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is an inverse temperature and @xmath3 is a free energy of the surface slope that will be defined precisely later . while they provide a direct informal argument to justify this conclusion , arguments at the end of @xcite",
    "also suggest that the pde @xmath4},\\ ] ] describes the surface evolution at large scales .",
    "as the authors of @xcite point out , equation is the small curvature limit of equation .    in @xcite",
    "the authors derive yet another pde limit . that pde has the form in but differs from the result in @xcite in the definition of the surface free energy term @xmath5 the difference is the result of an additional approximation in @xcite .",
    "those authors first consider the limiting behavior of the lattice model as the lattice constant becomes small and time is scaled accordingly .",
    "the resulting approximate microscopic model is an over - damped langevin diffusion for continuous valued height variables at each lattice site .",
    "the large lattice limit of such models have been studied extensively by funaki and co - workers in , for example , @xcite and , in the appropriate scaling , yields the pde limit reported in @xcite .",
    "this paper provides arguments and numerical evidence confirming as the correct large scale limit .",
    "we also provide arguments and numerical evidence establishing a pde similar to ( the pdes differ in the definition of @xmath6 ) as the correct large scale limit in an alternative scaling corresponding to large crystals with very rough surfaces .",
    "but before we state our conclusions more precisely we need to describe the family of microscopic models in detail .",
    "we will view the crystal surface as a function @xmath7 of time @xmath8 $ ] and position on the periodic lattice @xmath9 with values in @xmath10 the symbol @xmath11 without the @xmath12 argument will occasionally be used to refer to a generic crystal surface .",
    "let @xmath13 be a non - negative , strictly convex , symmetric function .",
    "the most common choice in the literature on the physics of crystal surfaces is @xmath14 which is referred to as the solid - on - solid or sos model .",
    "other choices of @xmath15 have been studied as well .",
    "for example , features of the discrete gaussian model , @xmath16 were examined in @xcite .",
    "define the vectors @xmath17 by @xmath18 and for any function @xmath19 define the symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 by @xmath22 the equilibrium probability for the surface gradients @xmath23 is @xmath24 note that our assumption that @xmath15 is symmetric obviates inclusion of terms in the sum involving @xmath25    the corresponding equilibrium probability measure for the actual surface is not well defined without constraining some additional feature of the surface such as its average height ( the total mass of the crystal ) . here",
    "we will be interested in the dynamics of crystal surfaces for which the total mass @xmath26 remains constant . restricting our attention to these surfaces we define the equilibrium measure , @xmath27    our dynamics will be specified by a continuous time markov jump process .",
    "the process evolves by jumps of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 note that the transition @xmath32 preserves the mass of the crystal , @xmath33 .    now that we have defined the transitions by which the crystal evolves we need to specify the rate at which those transitions occur . to that end",
    "we first define the _ generalized coordination number _ , @xmath34 for @xmath35 by @xmath36 one can think of @xmath34 as the ( symmetrized ) energy cost associated with removing a single atom from site @xmath37 on the crystal surface .",
    "we will assume that the atom at site @xmath37 breaks the bonds with its nearest neighbors at a rate that is exponential in the generalized coordination number .",
    "once those bonds are broken the atom chooses a neighboring site of @xmath38 for example @xmath39 with @xmath40 , uniformly and jumps there , i.e. @xmath41 since there are @xmath42 sites @xmath39 with @xmath43 the rate of a transition @xmath44 is @xmath45 as with @xmath46 we will occasionally omit the @xmath12 argument in @xmath47 and @xmath48    the above description of the evolution of the process @xmath46 is summarized by its generator @xmath49 knowledge of the generator allows us to characterize the evolution of any function @xmath50 of the crystal surface by , @xmath51(s,\\alpha ) + m_f(t,\\alpha)\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is a random process with @xmath53 and whose expectation at time @xmath12 ( over realizations of @xmath46 ) given the history of @xmath46 up to time @xmath54 is simply its value at time @xmath55 in particular @xmath56 = 0 $ ] for all @xmath12 and @xmath37 where @xmath57 is used to denote the expectation over many realizations of the surface evolution from a particular initial profile . for our process , @xmath58 one can check that @xmath59 i.e. that @xmath60 is self adjoint with respect to the @xmath61 weighted inner product .",
    "the jump process defined by the rates above is reversible and ergodic with respect to @xmath62    there are many possible choices for the rates ( and corresponding definitions of the generalized coordination number ) that would yield dynamics ergodic with respect to @xmath62 what distinguishes our particular choice ( besides consistency with established models ) is the fact that the generalized coordination numbers defined in are independent of the neighbor @xmath39 of @xmath37 to which the surface atom at site @xmath37 will move .",
    "this structure is motivated by our physical interpretation of the generalized coordination number as the cost of breaking all bonds holding the surface atom at lattice site @xmath63 once these bonds are all broken the atom is free to chose a neighbor of @xmath37 uniformly .",
    "this viewpoint is consistent with the classical description of chemical reaction rates in terms of energy barriers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we could define an alternative generalized coordination number by replacing @xmath64 in by @xmath65 this new coordination number would also be independent of the neighbor to which the surface atom at site @xmath37 will move .",
    "this generalized coordination number , however , would measure the cost to attach the atom previously at site @xmath37 at a neighboring site .",
    "such a choice does not appear to us to be physically motivated .",
    "suppose @xmath66 which is the example considered in @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath67 where @xmath68 in words , up to an additive constant ( which amounts to a time rescaling ) , the generalized coordination number is the number of neighbor bonds that need to be broken to free the atom at lattice site @xmath63    suppose @xmath69 then @xmath70 i.e. up to an additive constant , the generalized coordination number is the discrete laplacian of the surface at lattice site @xmath63    in both of the examples above , one can view the generalized coordination number as a measure of the curvature of the surface near site @xmath63 the resulting rates treat positive and negative curvature very differently and one might expect , therefore , that surface regions of a positive curvature will evolve very differently from surface regions of similar but negative curvature .",
    "one interesting conclusion that can be drawn from the results in the next section is that in the standard large crystal scaling limit this asymmetry vanishes while it is very apparent in the second scaling limit that we consider .",
    "before we can specify the pde limits that we consider , we need to define the relevant scaling limits .",
    "the first scaling regime is standard . for reasons that will be explained later we refer to this regime as the _ smooth _ scaling limit . for any function @xmath71",
    "we define the projections @xmath72^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] by @xmath73 in sections [ s : numerics ] and [ s : smoothkrug ] we argue that @xmath74 converges to the solution of the pde @xmath75\\ ] ] where , for @xmath76 the surface tension @xmath77 is the derivative of the surface free - energy , @xmath78 with @xmath79 notice that @xmath80 is the value of @xmath6 at which the optimum in is attained .",
    "the surface tension satisfies @xmath81(\\sigma(u ) ) =   \\frac{\\sum_{z\\in \\mathbb{z}^d } z\\ , e^{-k \\sum_{i\\leq d}v(z_i ) +    k\\sigma_d^\\text{\\tiny t } z } }   { \\sum_{z\\in \\mathbb{z}^d } e^{-k\\sum_{i\\leq d } v(z_i ) + k\\sigma_d^\\text{\\tiny t } z}}\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath77 is exactly the value of the external field @xmath6 that shifts the mean of the distribution @xmath82 to @xmath83    in one spatial dimension , with @xmath14 the pde with the @xmath84 just defined is exactly the pde suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , it differs in the definition of the surface tension from the pde identified in @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", the discrepancy with @xcite is due to an additional , small lattice constant approximation made in that work . in that approximation",
    "the height variable becomes continuous , @xmath85 and is governed by the over - damped langevin equation @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the discrete laplacian matrix on the lattice , @xmath88 @xmath89 is the square root of the positive semi - definite matrix @xmath90 and @xmath91 is an independent brownian motion for each @xmath63    the continuum limit of the diffusion in was studied rigorously by nishikawa in @xcite where it is shown that @xmath74 converges to the solution of the pde @xmath92\\ ] ] with surface tension @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95    clearly the surface tensions @xmath84 and @xmath96 are different and so , therefore , are the solutions of the corresponding pde and .",
    "we explore this difference numerically in the next section .",
    "that discussion has two primary outcomes .",
    "on the one hand , we are able to conclusively discern that the pde with @xmath84 is a better representation of the crystal surface evolution in this scaling regime . on the other hand ,",
    "that distinction is very difficult to diagnose as the solutions of the pde with @xmath84 and @xmath96 are extremely close . for more discussion of this issue see the next section .    before moving on to a description of our second scaling limit , we point out that one very interesting qualitative feature of the pde evolution in",
    "is that if the potential @xmath15 is symmetric and the initial condition is symmetric ( respectively skew - symmetric ) about @xmath97 then the solution of the pde is symmetric ( respectively skew - symmetric ) at all times .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the behavior of the kmc model itself where positive curvature and negative curvature have very different effects on the rates .",
    "it is however , consistent with the over - damped langevin microscopic model .",
    "our second scaling regime is less standard .",
    "we refer to it as the _ rough _ scaling limit .",
    "we will assume that for some @xmath98 the potential @xmath15 is homogenous of degree @xmath99 i.e. @xmath100 for all @xmath101 as before let @xmath102 where @xmath103 our second pde limit will require that we characterize the behavior of @xmath77 for very large @xmath83 more precisely we need to consider the limit @xmath104 as @xmath105 grows very large . as we will argue in section [ s : roughkrug ]",

    "in some respects this non - standard scaling limit is the more interesting regime .",
    "it retains many of the interesting features of the microscopic system that are lost in the more standard scaling regime defined by . for example , we have remarked above that if @xmath15 is symmetric about 0 and the initial surface is symmetric ( or antisymmetric ) about @xmath97 then the solution to is symmetric ( or antisymmetric ) about @xmath112 for all time .",
    "this does not hold for equation @xmath113 and certainly does not hold for the microscopic evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "a pde very similar to can be derived from by considering profiles with very small curvature .",
    "this explains our use of the terms smooth and rough to differentiate our scaling limits .",
    "indeed the rough regime can be thought of as describing very large , rapidly varying surfaces . in the next section",
    "we will numerically explore the features of the two scaling limits more carefully .",
    "we now provide a numerical comparison of our microscale and macroscale models .",
    "we will place particular emphasis on diagnosing the correct form of the surface tensions appearing in and in . in the smooth scaling limit giving rise to this means differentiating between @xmath84 and @xmath96 defined in and above .",
    "as we will show , straightforward comparisons of the corresponding numerical solutions of the pde does not clearly reveal the correct choice . in the second scaling limit giving rise to we will numerically explore the effect of the limit in defining @xmath114 the above comparisons will be performed in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we will conclude this section by showing the results of several simulations in @xmath115 ( 2 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension ) dimensions that demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the systems does not seem to be effected by the dimension . unless otherwise noted , the initial profile for both the pde simulation and the rescaled microscopic evolution is @xmath116 in 1 + 1 dimensions and @xmath117 in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
