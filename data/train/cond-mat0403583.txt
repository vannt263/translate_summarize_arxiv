    "bimodal transitions @xcite , stochastic resonance @xcite , noise induced spatial patterns and phase transitions @xcite , etc . in general case , considering a stochastic dynamics , one should deal with a problem to account for correlations between random sources . along this line",
    "several special methods were developed .",
    "most popular of them are as follows : ( i ) the cumulant expansion method @xcite ; ( ii ) the spectral width expansion method @xcite ; ( iii ) the unified colored noise approximation where evolution equations for both a stochastic variable and a random force are combined within unique equation of motion @xcite .",
    "the wide spectra of works are aimed to explore an effect of correlations of fluctuations in extended systems ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is appeared the interplay among noise correlations , nonlinearity and spatial coupling leads to a special type of noise induced phase transition known as reentrant transition @xcite . moreover ,",
    "such reentrance can be observed even in the limit of weakly correlated noise : if the noise self  correlation time @xmath0 , the system undergoes a single reentrant phase transition @xcite . in the opposite limit of the strong correlated noise ( @xmath1 ) a chain of reentrant phase transitions can take place @xcite .",
    "a kind of these transitions is continuous or discontinuous in dependence of the self ",
    "action part of a bare potential .",
    "quite peculiar picture is observed in the case of several noises whose cross  correlations can arrive at the remarkable and counterintuitive phenomena related to the problem of reconstruction of phase transitions .",
    "in such a case the stochastic system undergoes a chain of different phase transitions with appearance of a metastable phase in spite of the fact that bare potential does not assume such a phase @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , nowadays we have a scanty collection of works devoted to this phenomenon .",
    "perhaps , it can be explained by problems in realization of natural or computer experiments in extended systems , on the one hand , and by absence of theoretical tools and methods to perform the corresponding calculations , on the other hand .    above pointed phenomena force to reconsider before developed ideas concerning the theoretical approaches of noise induced phase transitions in extended systems .",
    "most articles concern the problem of above cross ",
    "correlations within framework of special models which are difficult to generalize for description of reconstruction of phase transitions .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation induced rebuilding in the system behavior is an open question that should be developed to find the unique role of stochastic environment influence .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the general situation to present the role of cross - correlation contribution of two noises into the picture of phase transitions .",
    "we explore an extended stochastic system which obeys the archetypal model of brownian particle . the adequate scheme which allows to specify statistical properties of the system with nonlinear kinetic coefficient in the overdamped limit",
    "is introduced . within a simplest model with nonlinear damping ,",
    "drift caused by landau  like potential and two colored ( multiplicative and additive ) noises , we show in what a way the system can undergo noise induced phase transitions .",
    "we find out phase transitions of both continuous and discontinuous character are realized as biased phase transitions .",
    "we obtain phase and bifurcation diagrams to elucidate the cross ",
    "correlation is one of reasons to appear the metastable states inherent in first order phase transitions .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "section ii is devoted to development of analytical approach to study noise induced phase transitions on the basis of kinetic equation for the probability density function and cumulant expansion method . in section iii",
    ", we apply the derived formalism to consider noise induced phase transitions in the simplest case of the ginzburg  landau model with both multiplicative and additive noises and kinetic coefficient dependent of the stochastic variable .",
    "on the basis of obtained drift and diffusion coefficients we build out an effective one  dimensional stochastic process being multiplicative but noncorrelated .",
    "related probability distribution function combined with self  consistency condition allow us to investigate the corresponding phase diagram and stationary behavior of the order parameter ( section iv ) .",
    "discussion in section v is based on representation of the effective stochastic process within framework of the mean field approach .",
    "such consideration allows us to study noise induced phase transitions by analogy with the standard landau scheme .",
    "it is appeared the noise cross  correlations and strengthening dispersion of damping coefficient arrive at transformation of the continuous phase transition into discontinuous one .",

    "in this paper we have considered the effect of the ordering of stochastic system with two correlated noises . in so doing , we have used a model of the system with landau  like potential @xmath11 , subject to both additive and multiplicative noises with amplitude of the last in the form of the power  law function @xmath202 , @xmath203 $ ] and affected by @xmath4dependent damping with coefficient @xmath204 , @xmath205 $ ] . within the framework of both the cumulant expansion method and mean field theory , the stationary picture of the ordered states is investigated in details .",
    "we have shown the fluctuation cross  correlations can lead to the symmetry breaking of the distribution function even in the case of the zero  dimensional system . with introducing the spatial coupling , noise cross  correlations can induce phase transitions where the order parameter @xmath206 varies discontinuously or in reentrant manner .",
    "we have studied the specified interval of magnitudes of system parameters where the ordered phase can be formed . with this aim ,",

    "above studied picture allows us to generalize the theory of the phase transitions to the system with set of stochastic forces of different nature .",
    "basing on the mean field approach we have shown the system can be described through the thermodynamic potential @xmath157 whose construction differs principally from the bare potential @xmath11 : so , if the latter has the simplest @xmath208form , the former is shown to be of the @xmath209form .",

    "correlation strengthening .",
    "this trend displays more strongly with growth of the index @xmath104 whose value determines the dispersion of the damping coefficient @xmath3 . on the other hand , transition from the ito calculus to the stratonovich one promotes to inverse transformation of the discontinuous transition into the continuous one .",
    "obtained results can be applied to a consideration of the complex systems which are far - off - equilibrium and hold several collective degrees of freedom . as shows consideration of three  dimensional lorenz  like system with noises being initially additive in nature , usage of the saving principle reduces two of these noises to multiplicative ones @xcite .",
    "the physical reason of such a picture is hierarchical subordination of different degrees of freedom . according to our previous considerations @xcite , @xcite a typical example of such type takes place in solid state physics where a reentrant metastable phase can appear if the matrix phase relates to random ensemble of defects of different dimensions subject to the field of plastic flow ( driven dislocation  vacancy ensemble ) . here , in the course of plastic flow different defect structures alternate one another according to picture of the first order phase transition . moreover , structural reorientation transitions take place where the sign of the order parameter is related to the resulting direction of the burgers vectors of dislocation cluster",
