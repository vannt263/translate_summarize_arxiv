    "dynamics of inhomogeneity plays an important role in many phenomena in general relativity .",
    "generality of inflation is one of such a problem . to explain the present our universe",
    ", we must have an inflationary phase in past .",
    "but as we do not know the initial condition of universe , we hope that universe can enter inflationary phase from wide range of initial condition . for homogeneous closed universe ,",
    "the universe can not enter inflationary phase if the initial curvature is too large@xcite . for inhomogeneous universe , the effect of strong(non - linear ) initial inhomogeneity",
    "is studied for space - time with symmetry by numerical method@xcite .",
    "these result indicate that sub - horizon scale inhomogeneity strongly prevent the onset of inflationary phase . but imposing symmetry to space - time may lose general feature of dynamics of inhomogeneity .",
    "we want to know about more general situation without symmetry using appropriate approximation that include non - linear effect .",
    "gradient expansion(ge)@xcite is one of such a method .",
    "this approximation scheme expands the einstein equation by the number of the spatial gradient . as the background solution",
    ", we have an inhomogeneous space - time that does not include the effect of a spatial curvature .",
    "we can include the curvature by calculating next order .",
    "this method describes a long - wave non - linear perturbation and it is suitable to applying to the inflationary universe .",
    "furthermore , we can treat non - linear effect without imposing any symmetry for a space - time .    in this paper",
    ", we treat einstein gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field by ge .",
    "our purpose is to observe the effect of large scale inhomogeneity on inflationary phase .",
    "especially , we are interested in how the onset of inflation is affected by the initial inhomogeneity .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "we shortly review ge approximation using hamilton - jacobi method .",
    "we derive the second order equation of motion that include the scalar field inhomogeneity . in sec.iii",
    ", we obtain the solution for the inflationary phase and discuss the effect of inhomogeneity on inflation .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to summary .",
    "we follow the method of salopek@xcite and derive the second order equation of motion of ge by hamilton - jacobi(h - j ) method .",
    "h - j equation is @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "these two equations are hamiltonian constraint and momentum constraint , respectively .",
    "we expand the generating functional @xmath2 by the number of spatial derivative @xmath3 the form of generating functional @xmath4 is assumed to be @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents spatial covariant derivative associated with @xmath7 .",
    "this form of generating functional satisfies momentum constraint strongly provided that parameter fields(integration constant of h - j equation ) are spatially constant .",

    "we have two equations for @xmath14 , but it can be shown that the second equation automatically satisfies the third one .",
    "so they are consistent .",
    "we derive the solution in the inflationary phase @xmath38 .",
    "we first evaluate the function @xmath39 : @xmath40 and we choose the integral constant so that the term proportional to @xmath41 vanishes . @xmath42 during inflation , we can neglect all but the first term in this expression because the condition @xmath43 is satisfied . to the leading order of this expansion",

    "therefore the expression of perturbation ( [ dphi ] ) , ( [ dh ] ) are correct in whole time of inflation .",
    "we investigate the effect of the curvature inhomogeneity . for this purpose ,",
    "let us consider a local hubble radius and a local scale factor that are defined by @xmath53 using eq.([evo1 ] ) , these quantity become @xmath54_{ti}^t               \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the co - moving hubble radius becomes @xmath55^{-1}.\\ ] ] this quantity decreases during inflation and grows in non - inflationary phase .",

    "the maximum value at @xmath57 for @xmath60 becomes smaller than one for @xmath61 and larger for @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that the negative @xmath63 enhances and the positive @xmath63 suppresses inflatinary phase .",
    "especially if @xmath63 becomes as large as @xmath64 , the co - moving hubble radius goes to infinity at @xmath57 and inflation may not occur .",
    "of course we can not apply ge to such a regime because the condition ( [ con ] ) is violated .",
    "but we extrapolate the behavior for small @xmath65 and predict the behavior for large @xmath65 . as the curvature radius is defined by @xmath66 , this critical value corresponds to the scale @xmath67 .",
    "if the scale of curvature inhomogeneity is larger than this scale , inflation may occur .",
    "but the scale is smaller than this value , we may not have inflation .",
    "this result is consistent with the result of the calculation of numerical relativity@xcite .    to see the effect of curvature from a different view point , we consider local e - folding time of inflation : @xmath68_{ti}^{tf }            \\approx n-\\frac{1}{24}(\\frac{\\r3}{h^2})_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the e - folding for @xmath61 .",
    "positive @xmath70 makes e - folding shorter and negative @xmath70 makes it longer than @xmath71 case .",
    "this also indicates that positive spatial curvature suppresses inflationary phase .",
    "we check the strong energy condition : @xmath72 at the onset of inflation , @xmath73 , so @xmath74 .",
    "positive @xmath75 or @xmath76 term make @xmath77 and the strong energy condition is satisfied .",
    "this means that inflation does not occur .",
    "negative @xmath75 can make @xmath78 if its value is larger than the @xmath76 term , and the strong energy condition is violated .      to check the result of the previous subsection",
    ", we solve eq.(13),(14 ) numerically .",
    "we prepare the initial condition at pre - inflationary phase . for simplicity , we consider only @xmath79 case .",

    "the zeroth order solution(@xmath85 ) has inflationary phase from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "for positive @xmath75 , the trajectory enters inflationary phase with smaller @xmath23 value(smaller @xmath90 ) . for negative @xmath75 ,",
    "the trajectory enters inflation with larger @xmath23 value(larger @xmath90 ) . after entering inflation , all trajectories",
    "approaches attractor solution .",
    "fig.2 is time evolution of the perturbation of scalar field @xmath91 . in hubble time scale ,",
    "its value approaches a constant value .",
    "fig.3 shows the co - moving hubble radius .",
    "@xmath85 curve has a maximum at @xmath92 and after this time , the system enters inflation .",
    "the positive @xmath75 makes the co - moving hubble radius larger and the negative @xmath75 makes smaller . these behavior is consistent with the analysis of the previous subsection .",
    "as we have shown , ge becomes good approximation in the inflationary phase because the perturbation goes to a constant value .",
    "if the initial inhomogeneity is not so large as to break the approximation , we can use ge as a model to construct an inhomogeneous inflationary space - time . as is well known ,",
    "a global structure of inflation is very complicated because of continuous creation of new inflationary domain via quantum fluctuation .",
    "we can grasp these feature by using a stochastic approach@xcite , but this method does not incorporate the information of geometry completely .",
    "ge can describe the space - time of inflation whose local hubble radius is different from place to place .",
    "the zeroth order solution has the form @xmath93 and choosing the time delay function @xmath94 appropriately , we can construct such a space - time as the solution of ge .",
    "we will discuss on this topics in a separated publication@xcite .",

    "after this work has completed , we noticed that the paper@xcite .",
    "they treat this subject in the same context as ours .",
