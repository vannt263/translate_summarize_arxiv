    "during the last couple of decades the exciting observational developments have enormously increased our knowledge about the history of the universe .",
    "a comparable progress has been made in our theoretical understanding of the main processes that govern the evolution of structure in the universe .",
    "a substantial part of this progress is due to the increasing possibilities to simulate the formation and evolution of structure on different scales using the new generation of massive parallel supercomputers .",
    "the standard model of cosmological structure formation is based on the idea of an early inflationary phase of the evolution of the universe . according to the simplest models of inflation during this phase fluctuations with a scale free power spectrum",
    "have been created . on large scales",
    "this power spectrum has been observed with high accuracy by the wmap satellite @xcite which measured the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the cosmological models are characterized by only five parameters : the current rate of universal expansion , @xmath2 , the mass density parameter , @xmath3 , the value of the cosmological constant , @xmath4 , the primordial baryon abundance , @xmath5 , and the overall normalization of the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations , typically characterized by @xmath6 , the present - day rms mass fluctuations on spheres of radius 8@xmath1 mpc .    since 85 % of the matter consists of dark matter particles the gravitational evolution of the structures in the universe",
    "is dominated by the dark matter .",
    "many codes follow only the dark matter clumping during cosmological evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but most of the information we get from the universe comes from the baryons ( either in the form of x - ray emitting gas , or from the stars ) . if one is interested in studying the distribution of baryons on large scales then gas dynamics must be added to the gravitational evolution in a cosmological simulation .",
    "this is not a trivial issue because gasdynamical processes are very costly to simulate once the gas is compressed to high densities when it falls into the potential wells of the dark matter distribution .",
    "thanks to the recent advances in massively parallel computing , and to the development of efficient mpi parallel codes that can use the total computing power of thousand of processors linked together , numerical simulations can treat more and more particles to describe the two main components of the universe ( collisionless dark matter and gas ) .",
    "this allows to simulate larger and larger computational volumes with enough resolution to identify typical galaxies like the milky way .    to compare the large scale distribution of dark matter and gas we have been able to perform one of the largest cosmological gasdynamical simulations",
    "ever done so far .",
    "we have followed the nonlinear evolution of both the dark matter and the gas component within an adiabatic , namely non - radiative and non - dissipative , cosmological smooth particle hydrodynamical ( sph ) simulation . in what follows",
    "we will describe the main features of the numerical simulation and will discuss some of the results of the analyses we are doing in the large simulated dataset .",
    "in our numerical simulation we have assumed the spatially flat concordance cosmological model with the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the normalization @xmath10 and the slope @xmath11 of the power spectrum . within a box of @xmath12 size the linear power spectrum at redshift",
    "@xmath13 has been represented by @xmath14 dm particles of mass @xmath15 and @xmath14 gas particles of mass @xmath16 .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of structures has been followed by the gadget ii code of v. springel @xcite . for the gravitational evolution",
    "we have used the treepm algorithm on a homogeneous eulerian grid to compute large scale forces by the particle - mesh algorithm . in this simulation",
    "we employed @xmath14 mesh points to compute the density field from particle positions and fft to derive gravitational forces .",
    "since the baryonic component is also discretized by the gas particles all hydrodynamical quantities have to be determined using interpolation from the gas particles .",
    "within gadget the equations of gas dynamics are solved by means of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method in its entropy conservation scheme . to follow structure formation until redshift @xmath17 we have restricted ourselves to the gas - dynamics without including dissipative or radiative processes or star formation .",
    "the spatial force resolution was set to an equivalent plummer gravitational softening of @xmath18 comoving kpc .",
    "the sph smoothing length was set to the distance to the 40@xmath19 nearest neighbor of each sph particle . in any case , we do not allow smoothing scales to be smaller than the gravitational softening of the gas particles .",
    "using for three weeks 512 processors of the marenostrum supercomputer at bsc barcelona ( this time corresponds to 29 cpu years ) we have finished the simulation and created the _",
    "marenostrum universe_.    .",
    "right : zoom - in on this cluster .",
    "the size of the box is 20 @xmath20 .",
    "substructures can be clearly seen.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "right : zoom - in on this cluster .",
    "the size of the box is 20 @xmath20 .",
    "substructures can be clearly seen.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "1 we show on the left a slice through the simulation showing the density distribution of the dark matter component . one can clearly see the large - scale filamentary structure . approximately in the center of the slice at the intersection of a few massive filaments one can see the second most massive cluster in the simulation .",
    "it s total virial mass ( baryons and dark matter ) is @xmath21 with a virial radius of @xmath22 . on the right hand side",
    "we show a zoom - in on this cluster where the substructures can be seen .     and sheth - tormen mass function ( dotted line ) at redshift @xmath17 .",
    "right : cumulative volume occupied by voids , title=\"fig : \" ]   and sheth - tormen mass function ( dotted line ) at redshift @xmath17 . right : cumulative volume occupied by voids , title=\"fig : \" ]      gravitationally bound halos of different mass form has been formed during the cosmological evolution .",
    "these halos consist of dark matter and gas . due to the hydrodynamical interaction of the gas in general the ration of gas to dark matter within",
    "the halos is different from the mean ratio of 0.15 assumed in the simulation .",
    "moreover , the spatial distribution of gas and dark matter differ inside the halos . even if one can see the halos my naked eye as white spots in fig . 1 it is a challenge to identify numerically all those halos within the distribution of two billion particles and to determine their properties .    for this purpose we have developed a parallel version of the hierarchical friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the fof algorithm bases on the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) of the particle distribution .",
    "the minimal spanning tree of any point distribution is a unique well defined quantity which describes the clustering properties of the point process completely @xcite .",
    "the minimal spanning tree of @xmath23 points contains @xmath24 connections .",
    "based on the minimum spanning tree we sort the particles in such a way that we get a cluster - ordered sequence @xmath25 .",
    "any particle cluster is a segment of the sequence @xmath26 , i.e. it consist of points @xmath27 for some indexes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "neighboring clusters , i.e. clusters which merged immediately after increasing @xmath30 , are neighboring segments on @xmath26 .",
    "let us denote the length at which clusters @xmath31 and @xmath32 merge , by @xmath33 .",
    "the sequences @xmath26 and @xmath34 are sufficient for deriving the complete list of clusters at any linking length @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the segment @xmath35 of the sequence @xmath26 is an @xmath30-cluster if and only if @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , if all points would be located on a line with distances @xmath39 between neighboring points , the line would break into the sequence of all @xmath30-clusters after cutting of all segments larger than @xmath30 . obviously , the sequences @xmath26 and @xmath34 ( each of length @xmath40 byte ) is the most compact form to store the information about the whole hierarchy of friends - of - friends clusters .",
    "after topological ordering we cut the mst using different linking lengths in order to extract catalogs of friends - of - friends particle halos .",
    "note , that cutting a given mst is also a very fast algorithm .",
    "typically we start with a linking length of 0.17 times the mean inter particle distance which corresponds roughly to objects with the virialization overdensity @xmath41 at @xmath17 . decreasing the linking length by a factor of @xmath42 ( @xmath431,2, ... )we get samples of objects with roughly @xmath44 times larger overdensities which correspond to the inner part of the objects of the first sample . with this hierarchical friends - of - friends algorithm we detect all substructures of halos .",
    "we are running the mst and fof analysis independently on the dark matter and gas particles to compare their properties . at redshift @xmath17",
    "we have detected 975500 objects with more than 50 dark matter particles .",
    "all of these objects contain also gas particles .",
    "running the mst and fof analysis only over the gas particles we have detected 630800 objects with more than 50 gas matter particles which reflects the smoother distribution of the gas particles .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the mass function of the fof - halos at different redshifts as total number of objects in the box . already at redshift @xmath45",
    "first few objects with masses larger than @xmath46 have been formed .     and",
    "the contouring is done by halo numbers per bin .",
    "right : the same for the corresponding gas halos.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath47 .",
    "the contouring is done by halo numbers per bin .",
    "right : the same for the corresponding gas halos.,title=\"fig : \" ]      it is well known that dark matter halos have triaxial shapes and tend do be prolate @xcite",
    ". their shape can be characterized by the three eigenvectors of their inertia tensor .",
    "thus the shape of the objects is described by the three main axes @xmath48 of a three - axial ellipsoid . in fig .",
    "3 we show the distribution of shapes of halos with more than 500 particles .",
    "the interval between 0 and 1 has been divided into 50 bins of length 0.02 .",
    "the contours show the number of halos per bin with the corresponding ratios of axes .",
    "note , that the position of the maximum is mainly determined by the large number of low mass halos .",
    "in fact , due to the power law of the mass function about 50 % of the halos in this plot have particle numbers between 500 and 1000 and more than 90 % between 500 and 5000 .",
    "the mean ratio of the axes of the dark matter and gas halos depends on mass @xcite .",
    "thus also the position of the maximum in the shape distribution shown in fig .",
    "3 will depend on the lower limit of mass assumed for the halos .",
    "however , the qualitative behavior does not depend on mass .",
    "the dark matter halos are triaxial and more prolate than oblate .",
    "the corresponding gas halos are only slightly triaxial with much higher axis ratios , i.e. they are more spherical .      in fig",
    ". 1 ( left panel ) one can clearly see the filamentary structure of the dark matter distribution with large empty regions between the filaments . in the following",
    "we define voids as regions which do not contain any halo more massive than @xmath49 .",
    "voids in the distribution of halos are found as described in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figtot ] ( right panel ) we show the cumulative volume occupied by those voids .",
    "the largest voids have radii of @xmath50 and thus occupy only about about 0.02% of the total volume .",
    "more than 14000 voids with radii larger than @xmath51 have been detected in the distribution of 505539 halos with masses larger than @xmath49 .",
    "they occupy a total volume of about 20 % of the simulation box .              due to the large number of gas particles that we have in this simulation , we are able to trace accurately the time evolution of the phase space ( @xmath52@xmath53 ) distribution of baryons .",
    "we can then study the redshift evolution of the amount of gas at different temperatures inside the computational volume . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ barion ] we plot this evolution for 3 different baryon components depending on the temperature : hot ( @xmath54 ) , cold ( @xmath55 ) and warm - hot ( @xmath56 ) . as can be seen in the figure , the amount of baryons in the warm - hot phase at present correspond to roughly 40 % of the total baryons in the simulation .",
    "they would represent a substantial fraction of the so - called missing baryons in the universe , as they would not be detected in x - rays due to their relatively low temperatures . in order to see",
    "how much of these warm - hot gas is located outside the dark matter halos , ( _ i.e. _ , populating the low density filamentary structures or in voids ) , we show in the right panel of the same figure the evolution with redshift of the warm - hot gas located inside different local baryon overdensity thresholds .",
    "a baryon overdensity of order 60 corresponds roughly with virial overdensities for an isothermal sphere in the @xmath57cdm model ( @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can see in the figure that the fraction of baryons above certain overdensity increase rapidly at early times and becomes stable once the universe is dominated by exponential expansion ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the assumption that the baryons follow a log - normal density probability distribution @xcite .",
    "we can also see from the figure that the amount of warm - hot baryons that live in overdensities lower than those inside virialized objects are of the order of 40% .",
    "one of the aims of performing this simulation was to obtain a large database of galaxy clusters from which to study different observational properties . in fig [ bfrac ]",
    "we plot the baryon fraction for 4000 clusters in the simulation which have virial masses larger than @xmath60 .",
    "the baryon fraction is normalized to the cosmic mean ( @xmath61 ) . as can be seen",
    ", the total content of baryons inside clusters is always smaller than the cosmic value for all clusters regardless of their mass .",
