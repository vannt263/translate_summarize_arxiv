    "the stability of the electroweak scale has driven the high energy physics community , both theorists and experimentalists alike , for nearly the past two decades . with the advent of the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    ", we can finally probe the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and possibly new physics at the tev scale that stabilizes the electroweak scale .",
    "however , as such new physics is still a mystery , we need to be prepared for all the possibilities .",
    "in addition , with the multitude of models of new physics and the possible associated experimental signatures , we are also faced with the ` inverse problem ' of distinguishing models of new physics using the experimental data .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate one of the possible scenarios at the lhc , and attempt to disentangle three generic models of new physics based on experimental measurements of a higgs boson .",
    "we suppose that , after the first few years of operation with an integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath2 , the lhc has only discovered a lone scalar boson with couplings to the @xmath3- and @xmath4-bosons that are of the same magnitude as predicted in the standard model ( sm ) . while discovering only a higgs boson at the lhc ( with an integrated luminosity of several 100 @xmath2 )",
    "has been dubbed a `` nightmare scenario @xcite , '' here we are only assuming no new physics , other than this higgs boson , is seen at this stage of operation of the lhc , and leave open the possibility that new physics may be uncovered with further operation time .",
    "indeed , one of the main goals of works of this type is to optimize further search strategies based on the information we have at hand from the discovered higgs boson .",
    "let us denote @xmath5 as the product of the higgs boson production cross section @xmath6 and the di - photon decay branching ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the main question that we attempt to answer in this work is : from the measurement of @xmath5 and its deviation from the sm prediction , can we identify this scalar boson as _ the _ higgs boson in the sm , minimal universal extra dimensions ( mued ) , littlest higgs with @xmath1-parity ( lht ) , or the lightest @xmath8-even boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ? if not , we investigate whether we can use this measurement as a hint or bias , and devise further search strategies of new physics based on its deviation from the sm , regardless whether such deviation is statistically significant",
    ". questions of this type are in spirit similar to the lhc inverse problem @xcite , but with an emphasis on distinguishing the models rather than mapping the regions of parameter spaces of a particular model from the data . while such lhc inverse problems have been studied in the literature , they attempt to distinguish models through properties , such as spin , of the new resonances discovered at the lhc .",
    "our work here is also of similar spirit to mantry et al .",
    "@xcite @xcite and randall  @xcite , where they discuss how the properties of the higgs boson can be modified due to states that are not directly observable at the lhc .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section [ sec",
    ": precision ] , we discuss the precision to which the signal @xmath5 can be measured at the lhc after 10 @xmath2 of data . in section [ sec : hgg - model ] , we discuss the general pattern of deviations of the signal @xmath5 in the parameter spaces of the models , and roughly map out regions in parameter spaces that such deviation can be significant .",
    "we also apply the results of lhc reaches in these models to map out regions of parameter spaces that can be consistent with the aforementioned lone higgs scenario . in section [ sec : hgg - lone ] , we apply the lone higgs scenario as constraints on the parameter spaces , and see how the signal is affected .",
    "in particular , we find that in the lone higgs scenario with a large deviation in @xmath5 , we can potentially rule out mued , and , in some cases , distinguish between the mssm and lht .",
    "also in section [ sec : hgg - lone ] , we propose some parameter - independent tests that can also be used to distinguish these models .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] with a summary of our results and offer outlook for projects of this type .",
    "in this section we present a brief overview of the detection of the higgs boson and the measurement of its properties at the lhc .",
    "more details can be found at the atlas technical design report ( tdr ) @xcite and cms tdr @xcite , and references therein . for reference",
    ", we show the production cross section of the higgs boson via gluon - gluon fusion at the lhc @xmath9 at the next - to - leading order in qcd , with the renormalization and factorization scales set to the mass of the higgs boson ( @xmath10 ) , using the latest parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , cteq 6.6 m @xcite , in the top plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : cteq66ggh ] .",
    "the uncertainties of this cross section , both the pdf - induced uncertainty as well as the relative difference with an earlier version of the pdf ( cteq6.1 ) , are of the order of a few percent as shown in the lower plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : cteq66ggh ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the luminosity will be on the order of 20% at the start of the lhc .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the measurements of the cross sections due to the uncertainty in the luminosity can be reduced partially by taking ratios of these cross sections to measured `` standard candle '' cross sections , such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .     at the lhc using the latest pdf , cteq6.6 m @xcite ( top plot ) and its pdf - induced uncertainty ( bottom plot , boxed points ) and relative difference with previous version of pdf , cteq6.1 ( triangle points ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=384 ]   at the lhc using the latest pdf , cteq6.6 m @xcite ( top plot ) and its pdf - induced uncertainty ( bottom plot , boxed points ) and relative difference with previous version of pdf , cteq6.1 ( triangle points ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=384 ]    the detection channels of the higgs boson depend significantly on its mass . although the higgs boson couples most strongly to the massive gauge bosons @xmath13 and the top quark , for higgs mass significantly lighter than the @xmath14 threshold ( @xmath15 gev ) , the decays @xmath16 are kinematically inaccessible , and the dominant decay channel of the higgs boson is @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , the di - jet background at the lhc is expected to overwhelm this signal , and the most promising channel of detecting the higgs boson is through its ( loop suppressed ) di - photon decay , @xmath18 , with a branching ratio of about 0.2% .",
    "the di - photon channel offers a very clean signature of higgs boson and enables a precise measurement of its mass . for @xmath19 gev ,",
    "the decay channels @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and ( for even heavier @xmath10 ) @xmath22 become dominant . at the same time , the di - photon branching ratio decreases significantly .",
    "as we are assuming that the discovered higgs boson is ( maybe only one of several higgs bosons ) responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking , the most general renormalizable operators involving this higgs boson would be those in the sm .",
    "the loop contributions to these couplings from new physics will typically be of the percent level that are too small to be probed at the early stages of the lhc , and we may ignore the loop corrections to these couplings . on the other hand , the couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 of dimension - five di - gluon and di - photon operators that characterize the gluon - fusion production rate and di - photon width of the higgs boson @xmath25 are one - loop at leading order in the sm , and loop contributions from new physics may be competitive . thus , to study this",
    "discovered boson in a bottom - up approach , we consider an effective lagrangian that includes all the renormalizable gauge and yukawa operators as in the sm , but with arbitrary coefficients , and only consider the leading - order effects of these operators .",
    "in addition , we include the two dimension - five operators with arbitrary coefficients that parameterizes the leading effects of the yet - undiscovered new physics on the higgs boson , and the measurement of @xmath5 essentially measures the product of @xmath26 ( which is proportional to the production cross section @xmath27 ) and the decay branching ratio @xmath7 . as the di - photon branching ratio is only significant for @xmath28 gev , we will only consider a higgs boson with a mass within this range .",
    "since the pdf - induced uncertainty is of the order of 5% , the precision to which these couplings can be measured depends crucially on the uncertainty in the luminosity at the lhc .",
    "the precision of which the couplings in our effective lagrangian can be measured at the lhc has been extensively studied @xcite @xcite . from zeppenfeld",
    "@xcite , we see that with 100 @xmath2 from both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite , the cross section @xmath5 can be measured to about 10% .",
    "this uncertainty is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of signal ( background ) events .",
    "we refer the readers to the reference for the numbers of events , backgrounds , and the significance of the signal .",
    "with only 10 @xmath2 of data , we naively scale our error by a factor of @xmath31 , and use 30% as the accuracy to which @xmath5 can be measured .",
    "thus , the measurement of @xmath5 with 10 @xmath2 at lhc can only distinguish models of new physics from the sm only if it deviates by more than 30% from the sm prediction , and we will see that this can often places stringent constraints on the parameter spaces of new physics models , independent of the lone higgs scenario .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the most widely - studied model of new physics both in theory and experiment  @xcite .",
    "it extends the sm with superpartners that differ in spin by 1/2 from their sm counterparts , and the electroweak scale is stabilized by the presence of these superpartners if they have masses of about 1 tev .",
    "it is remarkable that in the mssm the lightest @xmath8-even boson has a mass that is bounded by about 125 gev if the mssm is to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "as decay to @xmath32 and @xmath33 pairs are now kinematically suppressed , the di - photon channel is now the golden channel to search for the lightest @xmath8-even higgs boson .",
    "unfortunately , the mssm comes with 105 parameters @xcite and it is impossible to scan through such vast parameter space .",
    "we will make some simplifying assumptions that the first two generations of sfermions have mass matrices that are diagonal at the weak scale and the phases of all susy - breaking contributions are zero .",
    "these assumptions are consistent with the various flavor - changing experimental constraints , and leave us with a reduced parameter space . with this reduced parameter space , the signal @xmath5 can still vary greatly .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssmplot ] , we use ` hdecay ` @xcite ( which includes the ` feynhiggs ` package @xcite ) to show the deviation of @xmath5 from the sm values for various values of @xmath34 ( the mass of the @xmath8-odd higgs boson in the mssm ) , scanning over the s - top sector parameters @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the susy - breaking masses of the left- and right - handed s - tops ( the superpartners the top quark ) , and @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the top yukawa coupling ) is the coefficient of the trilinear interaction @xmath40 .",

    "this is presented in table [ tb : first - step ] . as noted earlier , decoupling the kk tops and gauge bosons in mued such that they are not directly accessible at the lhc after 10 @xmath2 necessarily implies that the resulting higgs boson would have a signal that is similar to the sm . in lht with @xmath147 gev ,",
    "the deviation of @xmath5 is only more than 30% in the limited ranges of @xmath148 560 gev and @xmath149 gev , and this region of parameter space leads to a viable lone higgs scenario only for @xmath150 .",
    "the mssm can also lead to a viable lone higgs scenario with large deviation in @xmath5 , for example , with @xmath151 gev and @xmath67 .",
    "although we noted earlier that , relative to the sm , the signal @xmath5 is always enhanced in mued and suppressed in lht , in a lone higgs scenario we would not expect mued to show a significant enhancement .",
    "if we see a suppression in the signal , we have to distinguish between lht and the mssm . before we attempt to distinguish between the lht and the mssm based on large deviations in @xmath5 alone , we first address what would happen if the lhc observes a higgs boson with a deviation in @xmath5 that is less than 30% .",
    "suppose that the lhc finds a higgs boson after 10 @xmath2 whose @xmath5 measurement deviates less than 30% from the expected sm value .",
    "though we can not directly distinguish between the three new models of physics from the sm , our results may nonetheless be useful in devising further tests to distinguish the models , for example , with consistency checks .",
    "broadly speaking , if the deviation of the signal is more than the eventual accuracy of 10% , then it may be worthwhile to pursue this deviation as both a lead for consistency checks and a bias for planning search strategies / signals that are more optimized to one particular model of new physics .",
    "that is , we are placing more confidence in the measurement than its uncertainty warrants , in the hope that subsequent measurements would improve the uncertainty without a great shift in the measured value .",
    "for example , suppose that with 10 @xmath2 of lhc data , the measured value of @xmath5 shows a positive 20% deviation from the sm with a 30% uncertainty . while this is not a significant deviation from the sm and this deviation is likely to fluctuate ( and may even change its sign ) with subsequent measurements",
    ", we can use this result to favor mued over lht and the mssm , since neither of these models can give an enhancement in @xmath5 .",
    "as such a deviation corresponds to @xmath152 in the range of 800 to 900 gev and the masses of the kk tops and kk gluons of about 1 tev , we may use this deviation as a consistency check to rule out the mued model if none of the heavy kk particle states is found , and seek other explanations for the enhancement in the higgs signal .    as another example , suppose that we see a 20% suppression of the signal from the sm with 10 @xmath2 of lhc data , we can then favor lht and the mssm over mued , and optimize our search strategies in order to both find additional expected resonances in these models as well as devise tests that may distinguish these two models when we find these resonances . to be more concrete ,",
    "let us also suppose that the higgs mass is measured to be 125 gev .",
    "such higgs mass is rather large in the scope of the mssm , and is consistent with heavy s - tops , with perhaps significant mixing that evade direct discovery . if we favor the assumption nature is supersymmetric , from fig .",
    "[ fig : mssmtplot ] , we see that a suppression of 20% in @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath153 gev . on the other hand , in the context of lht , from the fig .",
    "[ fig : lhtplot ] , we see that such deviation correspond to a rather low value of @xmath154 gev .",
    "these pieces of information ( @xmath153 gev or @xmath154 gev ) can then be used to devise search strategies that can differentiate mssm from lht .",
    "if the lhc finds a lone higgs boson with @xmath5 that deviates from the sm value by more than 30% , then the prospects are very exciting .",
    "first , in the case of an enhancement in the measurement , we can strongly disfavor all three models of new physics under considerations here , and seek alternative explanations for such an enhancement",
    ". neither the mssm nor the lht can give a enhancement in @xmath5 relative to the sm in a lone higgs scenario , and this large enhancement can not be consistent with mued because in that case some light kk resonances must be produced and detected at the lhc .",

    ", the higgs mass should be around @xmath155 gev to be consistent with both the mssm ( because the s - tops need to be heavy to evade discovery ) and lht ( because of the large deviation in @xmath5 ) .",

    "[ fig : mssmtplot ] .",

    "given a lone higgs scenario with a measured suppression in @xmath5 that is greater than 30% relative to the sm , we note in the previous subsection that    * if the suppression is greater than 40% relative to the sm , then mssm is strongly favored , and , * if the suppression in @xmath5 relative to the sm is between 30% and 40% , then both the mssm and the lht are viable .    in this subsection , we discuss how we may distinguish the mssm from the lht when the suppression in @xmath5 relative to the sm is between 30% and 40% with further lhc operations and seeking new resonances beyond 10 fb@xmath0 first we consider the case that the lht is responsible for the observed suppression in @xmath5 relative to the sm . in this case , a suppression of 30% or more in @xmath5 relative to the sm prediction corresponds to @xmath162 gev . for @xmath163 gev ,",

    ", we can obtain viable lone higgs scenarios by simply raising the masses of the new states large enough to evade discovery without affecting significantly the phenomenology of the discovered boson .",

    "( some of these tests have been stated in the literature . )    since the mssm is the most extensively studied model of new physics , and it has arguably the most complicated collider phenomenology of the three models that we study in this work , we present tests that may separate lht and mued from the mssm rather than identify mssm directly .      in the mssm ,",
    "the cancellation of quadratic divergence introduces new states that differ in spin and must be pair - produced due to @xmath94-parity . in lht ,",
    "the new physics that modifies the properties of the higgs boson come from the top - partners ( @xmath1-parity even or odd ) and the @xmath1-odd gauge bosons ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the discovery potentials of the @xmath1-odd gauge bosons and top - partners were summarized in section  [ sec : lht - lh ] , and it was pointed out that , while the masses of the top - partners depend on additional inputs @xmath185 ( with the top quark mass as one constraint ) , the top - partners contributions to @xmath5 is independent of these parameters .",
    "although we could raise the masses of both top - partners to evade lhc discovery at 10 @xmath2 , naturalness arguments favor light top - partners and it is not implausible that we discover the top - partners after 10 @xmath2 of operation . in naturalness arguments ,",
    "the role of @xmath183 in lht is played by the s - tops @xmath186 in the mssm to cancel the quadratic divergences in the higgs boson self energy , and , assuming we see new resonances related to an extended top - sector , we would like to distinguish @xmath183 and @xmath186 .",
    "one potential signature that can be used to distinguish lht model from both the mssm and mued is the single - production of the @xmath1-even top - partner ( @xmath183 ) @xcite .",
    "the production mechanism of such signature is similar to the sm single - top production , with the top quark replaced by @xmath183 . as new colored states in both the mssm and mued",
    "must be pair produced , this can be used to distinguish the lht from the mssm and mued .",
    "furthermore , in the lht the single - top production rate is suppressed as compared to the sm rate , and a precise measurement in single - top production rate can give us information about the top sector in lht @xcite .      as stated earlier , the additional particle content in the mued is very similar to that of the mssm : the kk - modes are partners to the sm particle content in mued just as the super - partners in the mssm .",
    "where as the gauginos obtain susy - breaking mass in the mssm , in mued models , the @xmath187 kk mode of the gauge bosons ( @xmath188 ) become massive through a ` geometric ' higgs mechanism : they eat linear combinations of ( dominantly ) the @xmath187 fifth - dimensional component of the gauge bosons ( @xmath189 ) and ( sub - dominantly ) the @xmath187 mode of the higgs boson @xmath190 . at the first kk level , there are then four physical scalar bosons from the un - eaten combinations that are dominantly the first kk mode of the higgs boson : @xmath191 , @xmath192 $ ] , and @xmath193 $ ] . furthermore , in the limit that @xmath194 and if we assume no significant radiative corrections to the higgs masses , these higgs bosons will have similar masses with fractional degeneracies of the order @xmath195 .",
    "effectively , the mued also contains a two higgs doublets just as the mssm : the zeroth and first kk - level higgs doublets .",
    "the higgs sector in the first kk level of mued models is similar to the mssm heavy higgs sector in many aspects :    * they both contain two electrically neutral ( one @xmath8-even and the other @xmath8-odd ) higgs bosons , and a @xmath196 charged higgs boson , * these states are nearly degenerate : the fractional degeneracies in the masses are of the order @xmath197 in the mssm , and @xmath195 in mued .",
    "however , there is one crucial difference : the heavy higgs bosons in mssm are @xmath94-even and can be singly produced at the lhc , whereas these kk higgs are @xmath198-odd and must be pair produced .",
    "unfortunately , as the lhc discovery potential for the singly - produced heavy higgs bosons in the mssm do not place stringent constraints on parameter space ( this allows us to have a lone higgs scenario with a large deviation in @xmath5 ) , discovering new physics through pair - produced higgs bosons is much more difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we point out this crucial difference in the higgs sector in the mssm and mued since , as far as we know , it had not been explicitly stated in the literature .",
    "furthermore , it could generate new signal event signatures outside the context of lone higgs scenario .",
    "in this work we attempt to distill traces of physics beyond the sm in the scenario that the lhc only discovers a higgs boson after its initial years of operation with 10 @xmath2 of data .",
    "we focus on the scenario of light higgs boson and used the signal @xmath5 to distinguish between lht , mued , and the mssm . for simplicity ,",
    "in the mssm we consider a limited lone higgs scenario where the s - top soft masses are large enough that , in addition to evade direct discovery at the lhc , the s - top contributions to the gluon - gluon fusion and di - photon decay amplitudes decouple regardless of the value of @xmath41 . given the expected accuracies of the measurement of the higgs - di - gluon and higgs - di - photon couplings at this stage of operation of lhc , and the implications of lone higgs scenario on the spectra of new physics , in mued it is difficult to have significant deviations from the sm . in the cases of the lht and the mssm , however ,",
    "it is possible to have a significant suppression in the signal while discovering a lone higgs boson , and such lone higgs scenario may give rise to a new resonance ( @xmath178 in the mssm , and @xmath199 or @xmath170 in the lht ) with more luminosity .",
    "in the case where the measured deviation is very large , we offer tests that may potentially separate lht from the mssm even before a new resonance is discovered . in case where the deviation is small",
    ", our work may nevertheless be useful and we point out that the deviations can be used to bias a class of model from another , and as such can be useful in devising search strategies of the favored new physics . although we have only worked out detailed strategies for 10 fb@xmath0 integrated luminosity in the case of lone higgs scenario , similar kinds of considerations could also apply to various stages of lhc running .",

    "<S> we address the possible scenario that the large hadron collider ( lhc ) discovers only a higgs boson after 10 fb@xmath0 of operation , and attempt to identify this higgs boson as that of the standard model ( sm ) , the minimal universal extra dimension model ( mued ) , the littlest higgs model with @xmath1-parity ( lht ) , or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , using only the measurement of the product of gluon - fusion production cross section and the di - photon branching ratio . in mued , by decoupling any new physics sufficiently to evade the discovery reach at the lhc , the deviation of the signal from the sm is not statistically significant . </S>",
    "<S> however , in lht and mssm , it is possible to have a significant deviation in the signal that is consistent with this `` lone higgs scenario '' , and , in the case of a very large suppression , we can distinguish mssm and lht before the discovery of any new resonances . starting with the lone higgs scenario and the deviation in this measurement from the standard model prediction ( whether or not statistically significant ) </S>",
    "<S> , we offer tests that may discriminate the models and search strategies of discovering new physics signatures with increasing integrated luminosity . </S>"
