    "nowadays , evolutionary game theory ( hereinafter egt )  @xcite represents an emerging field , whose interdisciplinarity makes it of interest for scientists coming from different communities , from biology to social sciences .",
    "the emergence of cooperation  @xcite in structured populations  @xcite , in particular in games characterized by a nash equilibrium of defection , is one of the main topics studied in this field .",
    "for instance , different mechanisms and strategies have been proposed to foster cooperation  @xcite in paradigmatic games representing pairwise interactions , such as the prisoner s dilemma  @xcite , and group interactions , namely the public goods game ( hereinafter pgg )  @xcite . since these models are mainly studied by means of numerical simulations , they often lack of an analytical description .",
    "however , the latter can be provided once some specific assumptions are introduced , as for instance considering memory - aware agents ( i.e. able to save their payoff over time )  @xcite . in the modern area of complex systems  @xcite , investigations driven by statistical physics  @xcite , trying to relate the macroscopic emergent behavior to the microscopic dynamics of the agents , are useful to get insights on a wide range of topics , from socio - economic systems to biological phenomena .",
    "therefore , in this work we aim to provide a description of the pgg by the lens of statistical physics , focusing in particular on the impact of noise in the population dynamics .",
    "notably , the noise is controlled by a parameter adopted in the strategy revision phase ( srp ) , i.e. , the process that allows agents to revise their strategy .",
    "the srp can be implemented in several ways , e.g. considering rational agents that aim to increase their payoff .",
    "usually , rational agents tend to imitate their richer neighbors , while irrational agents are those that randomly change their strategy .",
    "remarkably , the level of noise in the system strongly affects the macroscopic behavior of a population .",
    "although previous works ( e.g.  @xcite ) focused on this topic ( i.e. the role of noise ) in this game , a complete analysis is still missing .",
    "in particular , we study the effect of noise in two different scenarios .",
    "we first consider the case of a homogeneous population , where the intensity of noise in the system is controlled by tuning the level of stochasticity of all agents during the srp , by means of a global parameter .",
    "the latter is usually indicated by @xmath0 , and defined as temperature or as an inverse degree of rationality  @xcite .",
    "then , we consider a heterogeneous population , characterized by the two species : rational and irrational agents .",
    "while the former take their decision considering the payoff of their neighbors , the latter take decisions randomly . in both cases , we study the macroscopic dynamics of the population and the related equilibria , achieved for different amount of noise and values of the synergy factor .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the synergy factor , before mentioned , is a parameter of absolute relevance in the pgg , as it supports cooperative behaviors by enhancing the value of the total contributions provided by cooperators .",
    "eventually , we recall that the influence of rationality in the pgg has been studied , by a probabilist approach , in  @xcite where authors implemented agents able to select ( with a given probability ) between a rational and an irrational behavior .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] introduces the dynamics of the pgg , and the setup of our model .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows results of numerical simulations .",
    "eventually , section  [ sec : conclusions ] ends the paper .",
    "the pgg is a simple game involving @xmath1 agents that can adopt one of the following strategies : cooperation and defection .",
    "those playing as cooperators contribute with a coin @xmath2 ( representing the individual effort in favor of the collectivity ) to a common pool , while those playing as defectors do not contribute . then , the amount of coins in the pool is enhanced by a synergy factor @xmath3 , and",
    "eventually equally divided among all agents . the cooperators payoff ( i.e. @xmath4 ) and that of defectors ( i.e. @xmath5 ) read @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of cooperators among the @xmath8 agents involved in the game , @xmath3 synergy factor , and @xmath2 agents contribution . without loss of generality , we set @xmath9 for all agents .",
    "let us proceed focusing the attention on the synergy factor @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "in well - mixed populations of infinite size , where agents play in group of @xmath10 players , the two absorbing states appear separated at a critical point @xmath11 .",
    "notably , these populations fall into full defection for @xmath12 and into full cooperation for @xmath13 . when agents are placed in the nodes of a network , surprisingly",
    ", some cooperators can survive for values of @xmath3 lower than @xmath14 .",
    "this effect is known as _ network reciprocity _",
    "@xcite , since a cooperative behavior emerges as a result of the same mutualistic interactions taking place repeatedly over time .",
    "at the same time , the network structure allows a limited number of defectors to survive also beyond @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to the two critical values of @xmath3 at which cooperators first appear , and defectors eventually disappear from the population , respectively as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in a networked population , depending on the values of @xmath3 and on how agents are allowed to update their strategy , it is possible to observe different phases : two ordered equilibrium absorbing phases , where only one strategy survives ( either cooperation or defection ) , and an active but macroscopically stable disordered phase  @xcite corresponding to the coexistence between the two species ( i.e. cooperators and defectors ) .",
    "now , it is worth to introduce the mechanism that allows the population to evolve , i.e. the process previously mentioned and defined as strategy revision phase . in principle , the srp can be implemented in several ways , as agents may follow different rules or may be provided with particular behaviors .",
    "usually this process is payoff - driven , i.e. agents tend to imitate richer neighbors  @xcite . however , as shown in previous works social behaviors like conformity  @xcite can have a relevant impact on the way agents choose their next strategy . in this work",
    "we consider a payoff - driven srp , computing the probability that one agent imitates a neighbor according to the following fermi - like equation @xmath18\\right)^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the payoffs of two linked agents , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 indicate their strategy , i.e. , that of @xmath23 and of @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "notably , equation  [ eq : fermi_function ] is related to a srp performed by the @xmath24-th agent that evaluates whether to imitate the @xmath23-th one .",
    "a crucial parameter appearing in equation  [ eq : fermi_function ] is @xmath25 , which plays the role of noise and then parametrizes the uncertainty in adopting a strategy .",
    "notably , a low noise entails agents strongly consider the difference in payoff @xmath26 while deciding their next strategy , while increasing the noise the payoff difference plays a more marginal role . in the case of a homogeneous population @xmath0",
    "is equal for all individuals , so by tuning its value we are able to control the level of noise in the system . in the limit of @xmath27 ,",
    "the @xmath24-th agent will imitate the strategy of the @xmath23-th agent with probability @xmath28 if @xmath29 , and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "conversely , in the limit @xmath31 the srp becomes a coin flip , and the imitation occurs with probability @xmath32 no matter the value of the synergy factor . in the latter case the behavior of the pgg is analogous to that of a classical voter model  @xcite , where imitation between a pair of selected agents takes place with probability @xmath32 .",
    "our study aims to confirm computationally results reported in  @xcite , and to evaluate the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath0 , in order to provide a complete description of the pgg , from the microscopic dynamics to the global behavior of the population .    according to previous investigations , setting @xmath33",
    "is often considered as a good choice to describe a rational population , where a limited number of irrational updates may still occur . in the case of bidimensional lattices , it has been shown in  @xcite that for such @xmath0 the values of @xmath16 , at which cooperators emerge , and @xmath17 , where defectors completely disappears from the population , are respectively equal to @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is also possible to consider the case of heterogenous populations where the value of @xmath36 is an agent - dependent parameter . in such scenario ,",
    "the simplest way to control the noise is considering two different species of agents : those with @xmath37 and those with @xmath38 .",
    "thus , by varying the density @xmath39 of one species , with @xmath40 , it is possible to study the outcome of the model in different conditions .",
    "such second version is useful to analyze the behavior of a population whose agents have a different sensibility to their payoff and , from a social point of view , it allows to study the influence of rationality in driving the population towards an equilibrium ( or steady state ) .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath41 and @xmath42 , it is possible to evaluate the influence of a density @xmath39 of rational agents in driving the population towards a particular state . in the sociophysics literature",
    "@xcite , studying the effects of social behaviors in the dynamics of a population constitutes one of the major aims .",
    "just to cite few , investigations on nonconformity  @xcite , extremisms  @xcite and stubbornness  @xcite showed their relevant role in processes of opinion dynamics  @xcite .",
    "eventually , in a heterogeneous population , it would be interesting to consider more complicated cases where agents are characterized by a broad distribution of values of @xmath0 , and can possibly change their own degree of rationality , for instance by thermalization - like processes ( i.e. when two agents play , they modify their degree of rationality taking the average value of their current @xmath0 ) .    finally , we consider an asynchronous dynamics , where the agents sequentially update their strategy . in",
    "doing so , the population dynamics can be summarized as follows :    1 .   at @xmath43",
    "set a population with the same amount of cooperators and defectors ; 2 .",
    "select randomly two connected agents : @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; 3 .",
    "selected agents play the pgg with their communities of belonging ( accumulating a payoff ) ; 4 .",
    "@xmath24 performs the srp using @xmath23 as reference ( by equation  [ eq : fermi_function ] ) ; 5 .",
    "repeat from @xmath44 until the population reaches an ordered phase ( or up to a limited number of time steps elapsed ) .",
    "we indicate with @xmath45 the average number of updates per agents at which the dynamics has been stopped , either because the system reached an absorbing phase or because no significant macroscopic changes were observed in the system over time .",
    "the considered maximum length of the simulation is @xmath46 . since in the pgg",
    ", the strategy of the @xmath23-th agent can be described by a binary variable @xmath47 , with @xmath48 representing cooperation and @xmath49 defection the average magnetization  @xcite reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 corresponds to full cooperation , while @xmath52 to full defection .",
    "since we are not interested in the sign of the prevalent strategy , but only to which extent the system is ordered , we consider the absolute value of the magnetization @xmath53 . from equation  [ eq : magnetization ]",
    "it is straightforward to derive the density @xmath54 of cooperators in the population @xmath55 so that we can identify the two ( ordered ) absorbing states corresponding to @xmath56 ( i.e. full cooperation ) and @xmath57 ( i.e. full defection ) . in the following section ,",
    "the system is analyzed by reporting the average value of @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath45 over 100 simulations .",
    "at last , another interesting order parameter useful to detect fluctuations in the system s behavior is the standard deviation of the fraction of cooperator @xmath58 obtained over the different runs .",
    "we performed several numerical simulations of the pgg , for different values of the synergy factor @xmath3 and the noise ( measured either in terms of @xmath0 or density of irrational agents @xmath59 ) , in a population of @xmath60 agents distributed on a bidimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .    * homogeneous populations .",
    "* let us here show results for the homogeneous case , where the level of noise in the system is controlled by the global variable @xmath0 used in the srp .",
    "we first analyze the phase diagram of the average density of cooperators @xmath61 as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath0 figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] .        here , we observe that the pgg has a very rich behavior .",
    "for instance , plot * a * of figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] shows @xmath62 different regions ( below described ) of interest when studying the density of cooperators at equilibrium .",
    "notably , low values of @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) let emerge three phases as a function of @xmath3 in the considered range ( i.e. , from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ) : two ordered phases ( i.e. , full defection and full cooperation ) for low and high values of @xmath3 , and a mixed phase ( i.e. , coexistence ) for intermediate values of @xmath3 . therefore , at a first glance , an order - disorder phase transition of second kind emerges crossing the region labeled @xmath66 in the first phase diagram ( i.e. , * a * of figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] ) . for higher values of @xmath0 , next to @xmath67 , the active phase vanishes and the population always reaches an ordered phase .",
    "a more abrupt phase transition between the two ordered phases , separating region @xmath68 ( full defection ) and @xmath69 ( full cooperation ) , appears , resembling analytical results obtained for the well - mixed approximation , even if fluctuations are possible near the critical point @xmath70 . for greater values of @xmath0 , the region of @xmath3 around @xmath70 such that both ordered states are attainable increases .",
    "in such range of values the system behaves as a biased voter model , where the absorbing states of cooperation ( defection ) is favored for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) . in the limit @xmath31 , the behavior of the system approaches that of a classical unbiased voter model , no matter the value of the adopted synergy factor .",
    "plots * b * and * c * of figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] confirm the main differences among the five regions of plot * a*. the former shows that the number of time steps reaches the maximum value of @xmath45 for intermediate @xmath3 entered around @xmath70 with low @xmath0 , while @xmath45 is reduced when the population reaches an absorbing state ( i.e. , full defection or cooperation ) .",
    "instead , plot * c * shows that the variance reaches a maximum value ( as expected ) , @xmath73 , when the pgg behaves like a voter model , while smaller non - null values are also obtained for the active phase , due to the existence of fluctuations . in order to obtain a deeper characterization of the phase transitions occurring in the pgg",
    ", we study the average absolute value of the magnetization @xmath53 , as a function of the synergy factor for different @xmath0 values . as shown in plot * a * of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] , only for values of @xmath63 there are values of the synergy factors @xmath3 such that @xmath74 , since at @xmath75 a more abrupt phase transition between full defection and full cooperation emerges , resembling the first - order first transition predicted analytically in the case of well - mixed population of infinite size .",
    "then , we note that for all @xmath0 values in the range @xmath76 $ ] , it is possible to find a synergy factor @xmath3 such that @xmath77 .",
    "higher values of @xmath0 strongly affect the pgg .",
    "notably , the distance between the two thresholds of @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) reduces by increasing @xmath0 see plot * b * of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that these two values converge to the same point as @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , we also observe that the value of @xmath80 , for which cooperators and defectors coexist in equal number in the active phase , is always smaller than @xmath14 see plot * b * of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] .",
    "eventually , both plots * c * and * d * of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] clearly confirms the previous investigations . for instance , for @xmath81 the density of cooperators becomes almost flat as in a voter model ( see plot * c * of figure  [ fig : magnetization ] ) .    * heterogeneous populations .",
    "* we now consider the case of a heterogenous population , where a density of agents @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) with @xmath41 is inserted in a population of irrational individuals , performing coin flip to decide their strategy . in this configuration , the level of noise is controlled by the variable @xmath39 , and the lower its value the higher the stochasticity in the population .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : transition ] , the phase diagram obtained as a function of the different values of noise is qualitatively comparable to the previously considered case .",
    "as @xmath39 goes to @xmath82 the pgg turns its behavior to the expected one for a population composed of only rational individuals ( i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "remarkably , the outcomes shown in figure  [ fig : transition ] suggest that for values as small as @xmath85 , the pgg shows an active phase ( i.e. , the network reciprocity still holds ) .",
    "thus , very few rational agents are able to provide the population an overall rational behavior at equilibrium",
    ". see plot * b * of figure  [ fig : transition ] to observe the scaling for the critical values of the synergy factor : @xmath16 ( at which cooperators first appear ) , @xmath17 ( at which defectors disappears ) , and @xmath80 ( where cooperators and defectors coexist in equal proportion ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a detailed study of the role of noise in the pgg by the lens of statistical physics .",
    "notably , the proposed model allows to define a clear relation between the noise introduced at the microscopic level in the process named strategy revision phase , and the macroscopic behavior of a population . to achieve this goal",
    ", we start from the theoretical considerations presented in  @xcite , then considering a richer scenario and controlling the noise in two different cases : a homogeneous population ( i.e. all agents have the same degree of rationality ) and a heterogeneous one ( i.e. more degrees of rationality are considered ) .",
    "the phase diagram resulting from numerical simulations shows the influence of the synergy factor @xmath3 and of the noise in the macroscopic behavior of the population .",
    "so , beyond confirming results reported in works as  @xcite , our investigation extends to further insights .",
    "notably , the phase diagram ( see figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] ) shows many interesting regions . for a finite range of values of low noise , there exists a second order phase transition between two absorbing states as a function of @xmath3 , with the presence of a metastable regime between them ( region @xmath66 see plot * a * of figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] ) . for higher values of noise",
    "the active phase and network reciprocity disappears ( regions @xmath68 and @xmath69 see plot * a * of figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] ) and the system always reaches an ordered state . in particular , cooperation ( defection )",
    "is usually reached if @xmath3 is greater ( smaller ) than the group size @xmath10 , even if fluctuations are possible next to the critical point due to the finite size of the system . as the level of noise increases , the system approaches the behavior of a classical voter model ( region @xmath86 see plot * a * of figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] ) , where either one of the two ordered phase is reached",
    "no matter the value of the synergy factor . from the analysis of the heterogenous population case ,",
    "we note that even a very small density @xmath39 of rational agents , @xmath87 , allows to observe a network reciprocity effect . in such sense , beyond the physical interpretation of our results ,",
    "we deem important to highlight that , from the perspective of egt and from that of sociophysics , the pgg is a system that correctly works even in the presence of few rational players . here , saying that the system correctly works means that the equilibrium predicted for given a @xmath3 by the analysis of the nash equilibria of the system in the well - mixed approximation is achieved .",
    "finally , it might be interesting to investigate the behavior of the pgg for populations with greater heterogeneity in the rationality of the agents , and possibly change it over time . as a possible interesting case",
    ", we suggest that where agents modify their @xmath0 due to a contact process , in a thermalization - like process .",
    "even if the average value of @xmath0 in the population is constant , we reckon that differences might emerge with regard to the final steady state of the corresponding homogeneous population , due to the existence of a different initial transient where the distribution of @xmath0 is non - trivial . to conclude , our work extends results reported in previous analyses and , moreover , aims to define a statistical physics interpretation of the spatial public goods game . in particular as shown in  @xcite an analytical description , defined as the population",
    "were a classical spin system , may shed new light and even explain the behavior of those egt models studied only by a computational approach .",
    "the authors wish to thank matjaz perc for his helpful comments and suggestions ."
