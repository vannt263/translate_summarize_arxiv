    "in the standard model of the electro weak interactions , the lepton masses and the values of other parameters such as weak mixing angle , couplings , etc .",
    "are arbitrary and are therefore determined by experiments .",
    "these parameters are independent of each other and can not be determined uniquely , while the neutrino is taken to be massless because of maximal parity violation .",
    "the masslessness of the neutrino however does not follow from any other theoretical ground unlike the local gauge invariance for the photon @xcite .    in order to search for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ,",
    "light neutrino masses are incorporated in the extensions of the standard model .",
    "then , on quite general grounds one expects that neutrinos will also possess non - zero magnetic moments .",
    "experimentally , one places finite non - vanishing upper bounds on measurable neutrino masses and magnetic moments .",
    "presently , there is some indirect experimental evidence for the masslessness of the neutrino @xcite .",
    "massive neutrinos quite likely mix .",
    "the mixing of quarks is an established fact and because of quark - lepton symmetry , it is natural to assume that leptons exhibit mixing as well .",
    "an additional argument , in this sense , is provided by grand unification models , in which quarks and leptons are described in a unified manner .",
    "mixing means that @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , the states created in weak interactions , are different from the states @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 that have definite masses .",
    "the neutrinos @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are orthogonal combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with different phases between them .",
    "in addition , the sterile neutrinos may mix with these neutrinos .",
    "neutrino mixing has , as its consequence , neutrino oscillations , i.e. , the process of periodic ( complete or partial ) conversion of neutrinos of one type into another , for instance , @xmath6 .",
    "the components @xmath7 of a mixed neutrino have different masses and hence different phase velocities .",
    "it follows that the phase difference caused by the mass difference between the @xmath7 vary monotonically during the propagation .",
    "this phase change manifests itself as neutrino oscillations .",
    "if neutrino oscillations do occur in vacuum , matter can enhance their depth ( probability amplitude ) up to a maximal value @xcite .",
    "that is , a monotonic change of density may lead to resonant conversions between various neutrino flavors .",
    "this follows from the fact that when neutrinos propagate through a monotonically changing density medium , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) feel different potentials , because @xmath0 scatters off electrons via both neutral and charged currents , whereas @xmath8 scatters off electrons only via the neutral current .",
    "this induces a coherent effect in which maximal conversion of @xmath0 into @xmath1 take place ( even for a rather small intrinsic mixing angle in the vacuum ) , when the phase difference arising from the potential difference between the two neutrinos cancel the phase caused by the mass difference in the vacuum @xcite .    during nearly past half a century ,",
    "the empirical search for neutrinos has spanned roughly four orders of magnitude in neutrino energy @xmath9 , from @xmath10 mev up to @xmath11 mev .",
    "the lower energy edge corresponds to the solar neutrinos , whereas the upper energy edge corresponds to the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "a detailed early description of the solar neutrino search can be found in @xcite , whereas for recent status , see @xcite .",
    "the aspects of neutrino production in atmosphere of earth related to neutrino oscillation studies are recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the intermediate energy range corresponds to terrestrial neutrinos such as from reactors ( and accelerators ) and the supernova neutrinos .",
    "thus , obviously either going in energy range below these values or above are the available frontiers . for a general introduction of the possibility of having neutrinos with energy @xmath12 mev ,",
    "see @xcite , the upper energy edge for these high energy neutrinos is limited only by the concerned experiments .",
    "more detailed general discussions in the context of high energy neutrinos can be found in @xcite . despite the availability of the somewhat detailed discussion of progress cited in the last reference",
    ", the field of high energy neutrino astrophysics is still passing through its initial stage of development .",
    "the above mentioned empirical search has already given us quite useful insight into neutrino intrinsic properties such as mass and mixing .",
    "massive neutrinos and their associated properties such as dirac or majorana character of their mass , their mixings and magnetic moments can have important consequences in astrophysics . in these two lectures ,",
    "i elaborate some of the selected consequences and the constraints implied by these consequences on neutrino properties as well as the insight that one may gain about the nature of the astrophysical or / and cosmological sites and the interactions that produce these neutrinos .",
    "the explanation of observed solar @xmath0 deficit relative to its production value in the core of the sun , via @xmath13 conversion is an interesting example in this context @xcite .",
    "the general plan of the lectures is as follows . in the first lecture , i elaborate these aspects for the low energy neutrino flux ( @xmath14 mev ) emitted during the gravitational collapse of stars which may be accompanied by supernovae phenomenon . in the second lecture",
    ", i elaborate these for the expected high energy neutrino flux ( @xmath15 mev ) from some representative examples of remaining cosmos around us such as our galactic plane .",
    "this includes the one arising from the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic ray flux ( @xmath16 mev ) with the matter and radiation inside the sources ( such as center of our and other galaxies ) of as well as during propagation of ultra high energy cosmic ray flux to us .",
    "almost @xmath17 of the binding energy of a few solar mass collapsing core of a star is released in the form of neutrinos typically in an order of magnitude energy interval between 5 and 50 mev .",
    "in contrast , in the sun , the energy released from the core in the form of neutrinos is of the order of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , neutrinos from collapsing cores are expected to bring relatively more useful information about the mechanism of the collapse as well as information about the intrinsic properties of neutrinos itself , though still difficulties remain in obtaining a self consistent and a clear understanding of the exact mechanism of supernova phenomena",
    ". the rather optimistic frequency of occurrence of 1987 a like supernova is roughly once per thirty years .",
    "the last one occurred in 1987 implying that it is by now already half way . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimates of cumulative neutrino flux from all the supernovae that occurred in the past are also rather close to the present relevant detection threshold @xcite . for a more detailed introduction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "type ii supernovae are the most interesting from the point of view of neutrino flux studies .",
    "present theories of type ii supernovae assume that they are catastrophic endpoints in the evolution of massive stars with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 g is the solar mass .",
    "such stars form unstable iron cores ( or if the mass is closer to the lower limit , o , ne or mg cores ) supported mainly by degenerate electron gas pressure .",
    "partial photo dissociation of nuclei ( for instance , @xmath21 ) and electron capture by free protons ( @xmath22 ) as well as by nuclei [ @xmath23 , known as neutronization , causes the core to undergo a dynamic collapse when its mass exceeds the chandraseakhar mass @xmath24 ( which is function of @xmath25 ) , namely , when @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the number of electrons per baryon .",
    "it is estimated that most of the energy during this collapse is carried by the neutrinos . during the collapse ,",
    "the neutrinos are emitted not only by neutronization but also by the thermal emission .",
    "the significant thermal emission interactions include : pair annihilation ( @xmath28 ) , plasmon decay ( plasma excitation @xmath29 ) , photo annihilation ( @xmath30 ) and neutrino bremsstrahlung [ @xmath31 . in all these interactions ,",
    "the electron neutrino pair can be produced by @xmath32 or by the @xmath33 exchange , whereas the muon and tau neutrino pairs can be produced only by @xmath32 exchange .",
    "however , each neutrino emission interaction has an inverse interaction corresponding to absorption .",
    "both absorption and inelastic interactions impede the free escape of neutrinos from a collapsing core .",
    "the relevant important interactions include : free interactions ( @xmath34 ) , interactions of heavy nuclei with @xmath35 1 [ @xmath36 , nucleon absorption ( @xmath37 ) and electron neutrino interaction ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "similar interactions occur for anti neutrinos .",
    "the cross section for these interactions defines the depth of various neutrino spheres .",
    "these interactions tend to thermalize the various neutrinos and thus contribute to neutrino opacity .",
    "thus , the core of a collapsing star is the source of all neutrino and anti neutrino species .",
    "the fluxes change with time and are different for different species . during the initial stages of collapse , @xmath0 flux from the neutronization dominates . on the @xmath39 opacity stage ,",
    "comparable ( but not equal ) fluxes of all flavors are emitted . due to the difference in inelastic interactions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 )",
    "neutrino spheres lie deeper ( and consequently at higher temperatures ) than the @xmath0 neutrino sphere .",
    "this results in the higher energies of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) with respect to the @xmath0 energies . typically @xmath40",
    "but in the smaller flux of these neutrinos : @xmath41 . the energies as well as fluxes of non electron type neutrinos ( @xmath42 )",
    "are considered to be roughly equal .",
    "the spectra of various neutrinos being ( approximately ) fermi - dirac spectra with different temperatures and with high energy cut .",
    "summarizing , the neutrino radiation of a type ii supernova consists of two components : a @xmath10 10 ms electron neutrino burst from the neutronization of dense matter which is followed by @xmath10 10@xmath4320 s thermal radiation of @xmath44 pairs of all types ; @xmath0 , @xmath45 , @xmath1 , @xmath46 , @xmath2 , @xmath47 typically with the above characteristics .",
    "the thermal @xmath48 s are emitted via black body radiation from the surfaces of the corresponding neutrino spheres .",
    "their fluxes and spectra are therefore determined by the neutrino spheres , which in turn are essentially determined by the @xmath49 interaction cross section as mentioned earlier .",
    "the relevant feature of the above characteristics for present elaboration is that the neutrinos being produced in the central part of collapsing the star and crossing the matter layers with decreasing density ( from @xmath50 g/@xmath51 to approximately zero ) may undergo resonant conversions .",
    "there are in general two aspects of this phenomena .",
    "the resonant oscillations may change the properties of @xmath39 burst which is important for the burst detection .",
    "moreover , the change of the @xmath39 fluxes may influence the evolution of star : the dynamics of the collapse itself and of the expelling envelope .",
    "i intend to elaborate the former aspect in this lecture .",
    "the basic characteristic features of the neutrino fluxes , i.e. , the flux spectra of the various neutrino species , etc .",
    ", are the main testable ingredients of not only a stellar collapse theory but also of a possible occurrence of matter enhanced neutrino oscillations",
    ". these can be studied by existing and future detectors in some detail for neutrino bursts from nearby supernovae ( @xmath52 kpc , where 1 pc @xmath53 cm ) .      because the matter density inside a collapsing star is quite high so that a necessary condition for resonant neutrino conversions , namely the level crossing or resonance is satisfied ( see later ) .",
    "i , therefore , will elaborate only the effect of matter enhanced neutrino oscillations on the neutrino flux inside the matter and magnetic fields of collapsing stars .",
    "there are no matter enhanced spin flavor oscillation effects between a nearby supernova and the earth for downward going neutrinos .    a large range of neutrino mixing parameters determining the ( two",
    ", three and four ) flavor oscillations are presumably get measured in terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments with quite a good accuracy in near future perhaps before the next nearby supernova occurrence .",
    "this statement is further supported when one includes the already existing information on neutrino mixing parameters from solar and atmospheric neutrino flux measurements .",
    "the pure neutrino flavor oscillation effects may thus possibly be disentangled from for instance pure neutrino spin flavor oscillation effects for supernova neutrinos . in the possible presence of relatively strong magnetic fields in collapsing stars ,",
    "the role of neutrino spin flavor oscillations become relevant .",
    "therefore , i mainly elaborate here the effects of pure neutrino spin flavor oscillations of the type @xmath54 , @xmath55 in collapsing stars , assuming the smallness of neutrino flavor mixing for illustration only .",
    "the neutrino spin flavor oscillations can take place for majorana neutrinos for vanishing vacuum mixing also as the majorana type neutrino magnetic moment can mix both the helicity and flavor of the two neutrino states . a recent detailed discussion on pure flavor oscillation effects for neutrinos from collapsing stars is given in @xcite .",
    "at the end of this subsection , i will briefly compare the observational signatures of pure flavor and pure spin flavor oscillations ( in absence of flavor mixing ) for completeness .",
    "the general case of neutrino spin flavor oscillations in the presence of non vanishing vacuum mixing is briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "neutrino spin flavor oscillations are commonly studied by numerically solving a schrodinger like system of equations with an effective hamiltonian . using the notation of @xcite , i briefly outline the main steps to obtain it in a particular neutrino basis .",
    "i start from a most general lagrangian density , @xmath56 , describing the neutrino propagation in the presence of varying matter density and electromagnetic fields : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are matrices with lepton flavor and dirac indices .",
    "these matrices are in general space time dependent . in the dirac case ,",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are independent fields and thus @xmath56 conserves total lepton number .",
    "the equation of motions that follow from @xmath56 can be written as @xmath64 here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 the left and right - handedness is defined by @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 .",
    "a equation similar to eq . ( [ evolution ] ) can be obtained for majorana neutrinos .",
    "the total hamiltonian comprising both is @xmath72 where @xmath73 s are in general space time dependent potentials in matrix form in flavor basis .",
    "these describe the effects of neutrino interactions with the background particles and can be obtained using finite temperature and density field theory approach @xcite .",
    "the last term in above equation describes the effective neutrino electromagnetic interactions in usual notation .",
    "the flavor matrix @xmath74 contains both electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath76 are hermitian .",
    "the @xmath77 evolves a system of field equations that contain both negative and positive energy solutions . from implications point of view",
    ", it proved convenient to eliminate the negative energy solutions .",
    "this can be obtained by applying the following ( unitary ) foldy - wouthuysen transformation to @xmath77 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 the resulting one dimensional ( @xmath80 ) schrodinger like equations of motion including the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath81 where only magnetic dipole moment , @xmath82 connecting the same neutrino flavor in vacuum ( no neutrino interaction effects , namely @xmath83 ) is considered . in eq .",

    ", it can be shown that @xmath140 where @xmath141 is initial ( at production ) and @xmath142 is the final ( at detection ) mixing angles .",

    "the adiabatic approximation imply @xmath149 in the above eq ..    the details of application of above description for neutrinos from collapsing stars is given in @xcite . the reader is referred to these articles for further details .",
    "it was pointed out there that , the neutrino spin flavor conversions can occur for @xmath150 in a reasonable strength of magnetic field in the isotopically neutral region of a collapsing star for @xmath151 .",
    "this is because of the peculiar behavior of the effective matter potential , @xmath152 in the isotopically neutral region that a relatively small magnetic field strength is required to get an appreciable spin flavor conversion as compared to that in the sun at the same distance from the center of the star .",
    "the above feature is possible for spin flavor conversions between active neutrinos only @xcite .    briefly speaking , in the onion like structure of the progenitor of type ii supernovae , below the hydrogen envelope",
    ", the layers with mainly isotopically neutral nuclei ( @xmath153 ) follow such as @xmath154he , @xmath155c , @xmath156o , @xmath157si and @xmath158s .",
    "thus , the region between the hydrogen envelope and the core is almost isotopically neutral .",
    "the deviation from the neutrality is the small abundance of the elements with excess of neutrons ( @xmath159 ) such as in @xmath160ne , @xmath161na , @xmath162 mg and @xmath163fe .",
    "this region is referred to as isotopically neutral region , it extends typically for @xmath164 .",
    "the existence of this region follows from the fact that during the collapse , the core and inner region of the star is neutron rich ( @xmath165 ) , whereas the outer region is proton rich , essentially hydrogen envelope ( @xmath166 ) , for a typical type ii supernova .",
    "obviously , the neutron and proton densities are almost equal in between ( @xmath167 ) , which defines the isotopically neutral region . in terms of @xmath25 , where @xmath168 , the supernova phenomena imply @xmath169 in the outer parts , whereas @xmath170 in the inner parts ( as electric neutrality of the medium implies that @xmath171 ) .",

    "in other words , it is suppressed relative to @xmath174 up to three orders of magnitude and also changes sign in the isotopically neutral region .",
    "this is not the case for sun for the same distance from the center of the sun because of the entirely different physics associated with the inner parts of the sun relative to that in a collapsing star .",
    "the presence of the isotopically neutral region depends on the nuclear composition of the star just after the core collapse .",
    "it is independent of any external @xmath93 present in the expanding envelope of the collapsed star .",
    "its presence is also independent of the neutrino intrinsic properties such as @xmath175 , @xmath82 ( and @xmath176 ) .    in the case of a direct mass hierarchy ( @xmath177 ) and a small flavor mixing with @xmath178 ,",

    "adiabatic conversions , the above mentioned features are essentially absent in case of large mixing angle ( lma ) solution for solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "thus , the various features of future supernova neutrino data will possibly help to identify the role of magnetic field in the propagation of mixed system of neutrinos .",
    "the combination of the spin - flip effects with other ( flavor ) conversions may result in rather peculiar final spectra .",
    "for instance , @xmath0 may have the spectrum of the original @xmath45 , whereas @xmath45 may have the original @xmath1 spectrum .",

    ". more detailed discussion on prospects for future observations of supernova neutrinos can be found in @xcite .    in conclusion , all these detectors will in future , collectively provide the temporal , energetic , angular and flavor information for any stellar collapse in our as well as in a nearby galaxy .",
    "this information will in turn enable us to constrain the relevant astrophysical quantities such as role of supernova magnetic field strength in mixed neutrino propagation as elaborated in this lecture .",
    "the neutrinos with @xmath191 mev are expected to mainly arise from the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic rays considered to be protons ( @xmath192 ) here with the matter ( @xmath192 ) and/or radiation ( @xmath193 ) present in cosmos .",
    "examples of the astrophysical sites where these interaction can occur include the galactic plane , other sites within our galaxy as well as distant sites such as centers of nearby active galaxies ( agns ) and cites for gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",

    "i will elaborate the relative changes expected in the high energy neutrino flux because of these neutrino oscillations .",
    "i will also describe the basic crucial factors that determine the ( limited ) near future prospects for observations of these high energy neutrinos .",
    "though , so far there is no observation of neutrinos with energy greater than few thousand mev , whose origin can not be associated with the atmosphere of earth , nevertheless , somewhat optimistically speaking , given the current status of high energy neutrino detector developments and the absolute levels of predicted high energy neutrino fluxes , it is expected that possibly the first evidence of high energy neutrinos may come within this decade .",
    "a main motivation of high energy neutrino search is the quest of the microscopic understanding of the nature and origin of observed ultra high energy cosmic rays , namely the presently open questions such as whether they are protons , photons , neutrinos , heavy nuclei such as iron nuclei or some particles suggested beyond the standard model of particle physics , and where and how they are produced or accelerated .",
    "a positive observation of high energy neutrinos can raise the possibility of simultaneous explanation of observed high energy photons ( @xmath194 mev ) and ultra high energy cosmic rays as a result of hadron acceleration and interaction in the presently expanding universe .",
    "the neutrinos with energy @xmath12 mev can act as probes of the ultra high energy phenomena observed in the universe . unlike photons and charged particles such as protons and heavy nuclei , which can be absorbed or deflected by dust , other intervening matter or magnetic fields , neutrinos can more easily reach the earth because of their weak interactions with matter particles .",
    "it is therefore hoped that such neutrinos can provide information about the astrophysical ( or / and cosmological ) sources that will be complementary to inferences based on visual observations .",
    "a better understanding of the interactions involved in neutrino production and a more accurate estimate of resulting neutrino fluxes could entail important consequences .",
    "among these are insights into intrinsic properties of neutrinos such as mass and mixing @xcite , and the possible role of gravity on neutrino propagation in astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "however , it all depends on the existence of a sizable high energy neutrino flux . assuming an existence of a sizable high energy neutrino flux , several of the other neutrino intrinsic properties as well as the useful information about the source producing these neutrinos can be obtained , at least in principle .",
    "these include testing neutrino decay hypothesis @xcite , constraints on neutrino magnetic moment @xcite , quantum gravity effects on neutrino propagation @xcite , tests of possible violation of equivalence principle by neutrinos @xcite , as well as information on different properties of relic neutrinos @xcite . also possibly enhancement in neutrino nucleon interaction cross section because of various new physics effects",
    "may be constrained @xcite .",
    "an early attempt to constrain the neutrino nucleon interaction cross section is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the relevant average physical picture in agns is as follows .",
    "some galaxies have quite bright centers .",
    "the photon luminosity of these galaxies typically reach ( @xmath195 ) erg s@xmath196",
    ". these galaxies are typically several mpc away from us . in general",
    ", agns refer to these bright and compact central regions , which may extend up to several pc in the center .",
    "these central compact regions have the remarkable property of being much more luminous than the rest of the entire galaxy .",
    "it is hypothesized that the existence of a super massive black hole with mass , @xmath197 , may explain the observed brightness as this super massive black hole captures the matter around it through accretion .",
    "this super massive black hole is presently hypothesized to be formed by the collapse of a cluster of stars .",
    "some agns give off a jet of matter that stream out from the central compact region in a transverse plane and produce hot spots when the jet strikes the surrounding matter at its other ends . during and",
    "after accretion , the ( fermi ) accelerated protons may collide with other protons and/or with the ambient photons in the vicinity of an agn or / and in the associated jets / hot spots to produce unstable hadrons .",
    "these unstable hadrons decay mainly into neutral and charged pions .",
    "the neutral pions further decay dominantly into photons and thus may explain a large fraction of the observed brightness , whereas the charged pions mainly decay into neutrinos .",
    "agns , therefore , have been targeted as one likely source of high energy neutrinos . currently , the photohadronically ( @xmath198 ) produced flux of high energy neutrinos originating from agns dominate over the flux from other sources above the relevant atmospheric background typically for @xmath199 mev @xcite .",
    "for further reading on astrophysical super massive black holes , see @xcite .",
    "recently , fireballs are suggested as a possible production scenario for gamma ray bursts as well as high energy neutrinos at the site @xcite .",
    "though , the origin of these gamma ray burst fireballs is not yet understood , the observations suggest that generically a very compact source of linear scale @xmath200 cm through internal or / and external shock propagation produces these gamma ray bursts ( as well as burst of high energy neutrinos ) mainly in @xmath198 interactions . typically , this compact source is hypothesized to be formed possibly due to merging of binary neutron stars or due to collapse of a super massive star .",
    "thus , fireballs have also been suggested as a probable scenario for the observed gamma ray bursts , and they too are expected to emit neutrinos with energies in excess of hundreds of thousands of mev .",
    "for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "a nearby and more certain source of high energy neutrinos is our galactic plane .",
    "the incoming ultra high energy cosmic ray protons interact with the ionized hydrogen clouds there and can produce high energy neutrinos in @xmath201 interactions .",
    "present estimates indicate that the diffuse galactic plane muon neutrino flux can dominate over the atmospheric one for @xmath202 mev .",
    "a presently favorable astrophysical scenario for high energy neutrino production is that the    .comparison of the cross sections for the three high energy neutrino production interactions discussed in the text at @xmath203 . [",

    "the downward going high energy neutrinos of different flavors interact with the medium ( free nucleons ) of the detector , deep inelastically mainly through cc interactions .",
    "the three flavors on the average give rise to different event topologies based on these interactions and the behavior of the associated charged lepton .",
    "for instance , for @xmath205 mev , in proposed km@xmath209 volume ice or water neutrino detectors , typically the downward going high energy electron neutrinos produce a single shower , the muon neutrinos produce muon like tracks passing through the detector ( along with a single shower ) , whereas the tau neutrinos produce two hadronic showers connected by muon like track and is such that the amplitude of the second shower is essentially a factor of two larger as compared to the first . here , amplitude refers to maximum number of charged particles per unit length ( see right panel of fig .",
