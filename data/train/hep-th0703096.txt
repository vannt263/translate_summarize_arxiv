    "the theory of quantum mechanics is nearly one hundred years old and because there have been so many experimental verifications of its theoretical predictions , it has become an accepted component of modern science . in an introductory course on quantum physics",
    ", one learns the fundamental axioms that define and characterize the theory .",
    "all but one of these axioms are physical requirements .",
    "for example , the energy spectrum is required to be real because all measurements of the energy of a system yield real results .",
    "another axiom requires that the energy spectrum be bounded below so that the system has a stable lowest - energy state .",
    "yet another axiom requires that the time evolution of a quantum system be _ unitary _ ( probability - conserving ) because the expected result of a probability measurement of a state can not grow or decay in time .",
    "a quantum theory of elementary particles must also satisfy the physical axioms of lorentz covariance and causality .",
    "however , there is one axiom that stands out because it is mathematical rather than physical in character , and this is the requirement that the hamiltonian @xmath0 , which is the operator that expresses the dynamics of the quantum system , be hermitian .",
    "the requirement that @xmath0 be hermitian dates back to the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath0 is expressed by the equation @xmath5 where the dirac hermitian conjugation symbol @xmath6 represents the combined operations of matrix transposition and complex conjugation . the mathematical symmetry condition ( [ e1 ] )",
    "is physically obscure but very convenient because it implies that the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are real and that the time - evolution operator @xmath7 is unitary .",
    "hamiltonians that are non - hermitian have traditionally been used to describe dissipative processes , such as the phenomenon of radioactive decay .",
    "however , these non - hermitian hamiltonians are only approximate , phenomenological descriptions of physical processes .",
    "they can not be regarded as fundamental because they violate the requirement of unitarity .",
    "a non - hermitian hamiltonian whose purpose is to describe a particle that undergoes radioactive decay predicts that the probability of finding the particle gradually decreases in time . of course",
    ", a particle can not just disappear because this would violate the conservation of probability ; rather , the particle transforms into other particles .",
    "thus , a non - hermitian hamiltonian that describes radioactive decay can at best be a simplified , phenomenological , and _",
    "nonfundamental _ description of the decay process because it ignores the precise nature of the decay products . in his book on quantum field theory barton",
    "gives the standard reasons for why a non - hermitian hamiltonian can not provide a fundamental description of nature @xcite : `` a non - hermitian hamiltonian is unacceptable partly because it may lead to complex energy eigenvalues , but chiefly because it implies a non - unitary s matrix , which fails to conserve probability and makes a hash of the physical interpretation . ''",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe at an elementary level the breakthroughs that have been made in the past decade which show that while the symmetry condition ( [ e1 ] ) is sufficient to guarantee that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary , the condition of dirac hermiticity is _ not necessary_. it is possible to describe natural processes by means of non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "we will show that the hermiticity requirement ( [ e1 ] ) may be replaced by the analogous but physically transparent condition of space - time reflection symmetry ( @xmath1 symmetry ) @xmath8 without violating any of the physical axioms of quantum mechanics .",
    "if @xmath0 satisfies ( [ e2 ] ) , it is said to be @xmath1 _",
    "symmetric_.    the notation used in this paper is as follows : the space - reflection operator , or _ parity _",
    "operator , is represented by the symbol @xmath9 . the effect of @xmath9 on the quantum - mechanical coordinate operator @xmath10 and the momentum operator @xmath11 is to change their signs : @xmath12 note that @xmath9 is a linear operator and that it leaves invariant the fundamental commutation relation ( the heisenberg algebra ) of quantum mechanics , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the identity matrix .",
    "the time - reversal operator is represented by the symbol @xmath15 .",
    "this operator leaves @xmath10 invariant but changes the sign of @xmath11 : @xmath16 like the parity operator @xmath9 , the time - reversal operator @xmath15 leaves the commutation relation ( [ e4 ] ) invariant , but this requires that @xmath15 reverse the sign of the complex number @xmath17 : @xmath18 equation ( [ e6 ] ) demonstrates that @xmath15 is not a linear operator ; @xmath15 is said to be _",
    "antilinear_. also , since @xmath9 and @xmath15 are reflection operators , their squares are the unit operator : @xmath19 finally , the @xmath9 and @xmath15 operators commute : @xmath20 in terms of the @xmath9 and @xmath15 operators , we define the @xmath1-reflected hamiltonian @xmath21 in ( [ e2 ] ) as @xmath22 .",
    "thus , if a hamiltonian is @xmath1 symmetric [ that is , if it satisfies ( [ e2 ] ) ] , then the @xmath1 operator commutes with @xmath0 : @xmath23    a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian need not be hermitian ; that is , it need not satisfy the hermiticity symmetry condition ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "thus , it is possible to have a fully consistent quantum theory whose dynamics is described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "some examples of such non - hermitian @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians are @xmath24 and @xmath25 it is amazing indeed that the eigenvalues of these strange - looking hamiltonians are all real and positive and that these two hamiltonians specify a unitary time evolution even though they are non - hermitian .",
    "the hamiltonians in ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) are special cases of the general parametric family of @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians @xmath26 where the parameter @xmath27 is real .",
    "these hamiltonians are all @xmath1 symmetric because they satisfy the condition in ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "it was shown in 1998 that when @xmath28 all of the eigenvalues of these hamiltonians are entirely real and positive , but when @xmath29 there are complex eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath28 is the parametric region of _ unbroken _ @xmath1 symmetry and that @xmath29 is the parametric region of _ broken _ @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . )",
    "one can think of the non - hermitian hamiltonians in ( [ e12 ] ) as complex extensions of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the quantum theories defined by @xmath0 are complex extensions of the conventional quantum theory of the harmonic oscillator into the complex domain .",
    "the general constructive principle that we are using in ( [ e12 ] ) is to start with a hamiltonian that is _ both _ hermitian and @xmath1 symmetric .",
    "one then introduces a real parameter @xmath27 in such a way that as @xmath27 increases from @xmath31 the hamiltonian is no longer hermitian but its @xmath1 symmetry is maintained .",
    "one need not start with the harmonic oscillator .",
    "one can , for example , begin with any of the hermitian hamiltonians @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , and introduce the parameter @xmath27 as follows : @xmath34 .",
    "[ the hamiltonian in ( [ e12 ] ) is just the special case @xmath35 .",
    "] the properties of these hamiltonians are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that these new kinds of hamiltonians define valid and consistent quantum theories in which the mathematical condition of dirac hermiticity @xmath36 has been replaced by the physical condition of @xmath1 symmetry , @xmath37 .",
    "the condition in ( [ e2 ] ) that the hamiltonian is @xmath1 symmetric is a physical condition because @xmath9 and @xmath15 are elements of the homogeneous lorentz group of spatial rotations and lorentz boosts .",
    "the real lorentz group consists of four disconnected parts @xcite : ( i ) the first part , called the _ proper orthochronous lorentz group _ , is a subgroup of the lorentz group whose elements are continuously connected to the identity .",
    "( ii ) the second part consists of all of the elements of the proper orthochronous lorentz group multiplied by the parity operator @xmath9 .",
    "( iii ) the third part consists of all of the elements of the proper orthochronous lorentz group multiplied by the time - reversal operator @xmath15 .",
    "( iv ) the fourth part consists of all of the elements of the proper orthochronous lorentz group multiplied by @xmath1 .",
    "note that parts ( ii ) ",
    "( iv ) are not subgroups of the lorentz group because they do not contain the identity element .",
    "these four parts of the lorentz group are disconnected because there is no continuous path in group space from one part to another .",
    "when we say that lorentz invariance is a physical requirement of a theory , what we really mean is that the theory must be invariant under lorentz transformations belonging to the proper , orthochronous lorentz group . we know that the physical world is",
    "_ not _ invariant under the full homogeneous lorentz group because it has been demonstrated experimentally that there exist weak processes that do not respect parity symmetry and other weak processes that do not respect time - reversal symmetry .",
    "one can extend the real lorentz group to the _ complex _ lorentz group @xcite .",
    "( to perform this extension it is necessary to make the crucial assumption that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are real and bounded below . )",
    "the complex lorentz group consists of _ two _ and not four disconnected parts . in the complex lorentz group",
    "there exists a continuous path in group space from the elements of the real proper , orthochronous lorentz group to the elements of part ( iv ) of the real lorentz group .",
    "there also exists a continuous path in group space from the elements of part ( ii ) to the elements of part ( iii ) of the real lorentz group .",
    "thus , while we know that the world is not invariant under @xmath9 reflection or under @xmath15 reflection , we are proposing here to consider the possibility suggested by complex group analysis that a fundamental discrete symmetry of the world is @xmath1 symmetry , or space - time reflection symmetry .",
    "the most important consequence of the discovery that non - hermitian @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians can define acceptable theories of quantum mechanics is that we now can construct many new kinds of hamiltonians that only a decade ago would have been rejected as being unphysical because they violate the axiom of hermiticity . in this paper",
    "we will examine some of these new hamiltonians and discuss the properties and possible physical implications of the theories defined by these hamiltonians .",
    "so far , there have been no experiments that prove clearly and definitively that quantum systems defined by non - hermitian @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians do exist in nature .",
    "however , one should keep an open mind regarding the kinds of theories that one is willing to consider .",
    "indeed , gell - mann s `` totalitarian principle '' states that among all possible physical theories `` everything which is not forbidden is compulsory . ''",
    "like many research areas in science , the study of non - hermitian hamiltonians having real spectra began in a haphazard and diffuse fashion .",
    "there are numerous early examples of isolated and disconnected discoveries of such non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "for example , in 1980 caliceti _",
    "_ , who were studying borel summation of divergent perturbation series arising from classes of anharmonic oscillators , were astonished to find that the eigenvalues of an oscillator having an imaginary cubic selfinteraction term are real @xcite . in the summer of 1993 , when i was visiting cen saclay , i learned that bessis and zinn - justin had noticed on the basis of numerical work that some of the eigenvalues of the cubic hamiltonian in ( [ e10 ] ) seemed to be real , and they wondered if the spectrum might be entirely real @xcite .",
    "[ their interest in the hamiltonian ( [ e10 ] ) was piqued by the lee - yang edge singularity . ] in 1982 andrianov , who was doing perturbative studies of @xmath38 potentials , found evidence that such theories might have real eigenvalues @xcite . in 1992",
    "hollowood @xcite and scholtz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discovered in their own areas of research surprising examples of non - hermitian hamiltonians having real spectra .",
    "the field of @xmath1-symmetric quantum mechanics was established in 1998 with the discovery by bender and boettcher that the numerical conjectures of bessis and zinn - justin were not only valid , but were just one instance of a huge class of non - hermitian schrdinger eigenvalue problems whose spectra are entirely real and positive @xcite .",
    "bender and boettcher showed that the reality of the spectra was due to a symmetry principle , namely the condition of an unbroken space - time reflection symmetry , and they argued that this symmetry principle could replace the usual requirement of dirac hermiticity .",
    "this discovery by bender and boettcher relies on two essential mathematical ingredients .",
    "first , bender and boettcher used the techniques of analytic continuation of eigenvalue problems .",
    "these fundamental techniques were developed and used heavily in the early work of bender and wu on divergent perturbation series @xcite and were later used by bender and turbiner @xcite .",
    "these techniques are crucial because they show how to analytically continue the boundary conditions of an eigenvalue problem as a function of a parameter in the hamiltonian .",
    "second , bender and boettcher used the delta - expansion techniques that had been discovered and developed by bender _",
    "et al_. @xcite as a way to avoid divergent perturbation series .",
    "the delta expansion is a powerful perturbation - theory technique in which the small perturbation parameter is a measure of the nonlinearity of the problem . as a result ,",
    "many crucial properties of the problem are exactly preserved as this parameter varies . in the case of @xmath1-symmetric quantum mechanics ,",
    "it is the reality of the eigenvalues that is exactly maintained as the perturbation parameter @xmath27 in ( [ e12 ] ) is varied .",
    "many researchers have contributed immensely to the development of @xmath1-symmetric quantum mechanics by discovering new examples and models , proving theorems , and performing numerical and asymptotic analysis . in the past few years",
    "a large and active research community has developed and there have been half a dozen international conferences on the subject of @xmath1 symmetry , pseudo - hermiticity , and non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "the proceedings of these conferences provide a complete source of references @xcite . by now , there have been so many contributions to the field that it is impossible to describe them all in this one paper .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an elementary introduction to this exciting and active field of research . in writing this paper",

    "[ s9 ] we make some brief concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we show how to calculate the eigenvalues of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "we begin by pointing out that the hamiltonian operator defines and determines the physical properties of a quantum theory in three important ways :    * _ the hamiltonian determines the energy levels of the quantum theory_. to find these energy levels one must solve the time - independent schrdinger eigenvalue problem @xmath40 this equation usually takes the form of a differential equation that must be solved subject to boundary conditions on the eigenfunction @xmath41 . in the case of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian",
    "it is crucial that the boundary conditions be imposed properly .",
    "we emphasize that for a quantum theory to be physically acceptable the energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian must be real and bounded below . * _ the hamiltonian specifies the time evolution of the states and operators of the quantum theory_. to determine the time evolution of a state @xmath42 in the schrdinger picture we must solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath43 the solution to this first - order differential equation is straightforward because @xmath0 is assumed to be independent of time : @xmath44 we call @xmath7 the _ time - evolution operator_. in conventional quantum mechanics the time - evolution operator is unitary because the hamiltonian @xmath0 is hermitian . as a result , the norm of the state @xmath42 remains constant in time .",
    "the constancy of the norm is an essential feature of a quantum system because the norm of a state is a probability , and this probability must remain constant in time .",
    "if this probability were to grow or decay in time , we would say that the theory violates unitarity . in @xmath1-symmetric quantum mechanics",
    "@xmath0 is not dirac hermitian , but the norms of states are still time independent . * _ the hamiltonian incorporates the symmetries of the theory_. as an example , suppose that the hamiltonian @xmath0 commutes with the parity operator @xmath9 .",
    "we then say that the hamiltonian is _",
    "parity invariant_. since @xmath9 is a linear operator , we know that the eigenstates of the hamiltonian [ the solutions to ( [ e13 ] ) ] will also be eigenstates of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the eigenstates of @xmath0 will have a definite parity ; they will be either even or odd under space reflection .",
    "( of course , a general state , which is a linear combination of the eigenstates of @xmath0 , need not have definite parity . )      for the case of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian , the @xmath1 operator commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath0 [ see ( [ e9 ] ) ] . however , @xmath1 symmetry is more subtle than parity symmetry because the @xmath1 operator is not linear .",
    "because @xmath1 is not linear , the eigenstates of @xmath0 may or may not be eigenstates of @xmath1 .",
    "let us see what may go wrong if we assume that an eigenstate @xmath41 of the hamiltonian @xmath0 is also an eigenstate of the @xmath1 operator .",
    "call the eigenvalue @xmath45 and express the eigenvalue condition as @xmath46 multiply ( [ e16 ] ) by @xmath1 on the left and use the property that @xmath47 [ see ( [ e7 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) ] : @xmath48 since @xmath15 is antilinear [ see ( [ e6 ] ) ] , we get @xmath49 thus , @xmath50 and the eigenvalue @xmath45 of the @xmath1 operator is a pure phase : @xmath51    next , multiply the eigenvalue equation ( [ e13 ] ) by @xmath1 on the left and again use the property that @xmath47 : @xmath52 using the eigenvalue equation ( [ e16 ] ) and recalling that @xmath1 commutes with @xmath0 , we get @xmath53 finally , we again use the property that @xmath15 is antilinear to obtain @xmath54 since @xmath45 is nonzero [ see ( [ e19 ] ) ] , we conclude that the eigenvalue @xmath55 is real : @xmath56 .    in general , this conclusion is false , as fig .",
    "[ f1 ] clearly demonstrates .",
    "when @xmath29 , some of the eigenvalues have disappeared because they are complex . on the other hand , for the restricted region @xmath28 this conclusion is correct ; all of the eigenvalues are indeed real . we are then led to make the following definition : if every eigenfunction of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian is also an eigenfunction of the @xmath1 operator , we say that the @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath0 is _",
    "unbroken_. conversely , if some of the eigenfunctions of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian are not simultaneously eigenfunctions of the @xmath1 operator , we say that the @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath0 is _",
    "broken_.    the correct way to interpret ( [ e22 ] ) is that if a hamiltonian has an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry , then all of its eigenvalues are real .",
    "thus , to establish that the eigenvalues of a particular @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian are real , it is necessary to prove that the @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath0 is unbroken .",
    "this is difficult to show , and it took several years after the discovery of the family of @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians in ( [ e12 ] ) before a complete and rigorous proof was finally constructed by dorey _",
    "_ in 2001 @xcite.-@xmath57 relation , the monodromy group , and an array of techniques used in conformal quantum field theory .",
    "this proof is too technical to be described in this paper , but it was a significant advance because it establishes a correspondence between ordinary differential equations and integrable models .",
    "this correspondence is known as the _ ode - im correspondence _",
    "many others have contributed to the rigorous mathematical development of the theory of @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "these include shin @xcite , pham @xcite , delabaere @xcite , trinh @xcite , weigert @xcite , and scholtz and geyer @xcite .",

    "our objective in this section is to show how to calculate the eigenvalues of the schrdinger eigenvalue problem ( [ e13 ] ) .",
    "the most direct approach is to write ( [ e13 ] ) as a differential equation in coordinate space .",
    "the principal conceptual difficulty that we face in solving this differential equation is in identifying and understanding the boundary conditions on the coordinate - space eigenfunctions .",
    "to write ( [ e13 ] ) in coordinate space , we make the standard transcriptions @xmath58 except that we treat the variable @xmath59 as complex . the schrdinger eigenvalue problem ( [ e13 ] ) then takes the form @xmath60    although we can not solve this equation exactly for arbitrary @xmath27 , we can easily find the possible asymptotic behaviors of its solutions by using the wkb approximation .",
    "in general , for any differential equation of the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a function that grows as @xmath63 , we know that the exponential component of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath64 for large @xmath65 has the form @xmath66 . \\label{e25}\\ ] ]    to identify the appropriate boundary conditions to impose on @xmath67 , we consider first the hermitian case @xmath68 ( the harmonic oscillator ) . from ( [ e25 ] )",
    "we can see immediately that the possible asymptotic behaviors of solutions are @xmath69 .",
    "the usual requirement that the eigenfunction be square - integrable implies that we must choose the negative sign in the exponent , and therefore the eigenfunctions are gaussian - like for large @xmath65 .",
    "this result extends into the complex-@xmath59 plane : if the eigenfunctions vanish exponentially on the real-@xmath59 axis for large @xmath65 , they must also vanish in two wedges of opening angle @xmath70 in the complex plane centered about the positive - real and negative - real axes .",
    "these wedges are called _ stokes wedges _ @xcite .    what happens as @xmath27 increases from @xmath31 ?",
    "as soon as @xmath71 ( @xmath27 noninteger ) , a logarithmic branch point appears at the origin @xmath72 . without loss of generality",

    "in this cut plane the solutions to the differential equation ( [ e24 ] ) are single - valued . from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath67 in ( [ e25 ] )",
    ", we deduce that the stokes wedges rotate downward into the complex-@xmath59 plane and that the opening angles of the wedges decrease as @xmath27 increases .",
    "there are many wedges in which @xmath74 as @xmath63 .",
    "thus , there are many eigenvalue problems associated with the differential equation ( [ e24 ] ) .",
    "we choose to continue the eigenvalue differential equation ( [ e24 ] ) smoothly away from the location of the harmonic oscillator wedges at @xmath68 .",
    "( a detailed description of how to extend eigenvalue equations into the complex plane may be found in ref .  @xcite . ) for @xmath71 the center lines of the left and right wedges lie at the angles @xmath75 the opening angle of each of these wedges is @xmath76 .",
    "the differential equation ( [ e24 ] ) may be integrated along any path in the complex-@xmath59 plane as long as the ends of the path approach complex infinity inside the left wedge and the right wedge .",
    "note that these wedges contain the real-@xmath59 axis when @xmath77 .",

    "the notion of analytically continuing a hamiltonian into the complex plane was first discussed in 1952 by dyson , who argued heuristically that perturbation theory for quantum electrodynamics diverges @xcite .",

    "[ f1 ] .",
    "how can the hamiltonian ( [ e11 ] ) possess two such astonishingly different spectra ?",

    "one possible procedure for generating new nonlinear equations from the kdv equation is to introduce the real parameter @xmath27 as follows : @xmath791 various members of this family of equations have been studied in ref .",
    "of course , there are other ways to extend the kdv equation into the complex domain while preserving @xmath1 symmetry ; see , for example ref .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to extend physical theories into the complex domain .",
    "the complex domain is huge compared with the real domain , and therefore there are many exciting new theories to explore .",
    "the obvious potential problem with extending a real theory into complex space is that one may lose some of the characteristics that a valid physical theory must possess .",
    "thus , it is necessary that this complex extension be tightly constrained .",
    "we have shown that the essential physical axioms of a quantum theory are maintained if the complex extension is done in such a way as to preserve @xmath1 symmetry .",

    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath0 specifies the energy levels and time evolution of a quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> a standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that @xmath0 be hermitian because hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary ( probability - preserving ) . </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of hermiticity ( transpose + complex conjugate ) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space - time reflection ( @xmath1 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 has an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry , then the spectrum is real . </S>",
    "<S> examples of @xmath1-symmetric non - hermitian quantum - mechanical hamiltonians are @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> amazingly , the energy levels of these hamiltonians are all real and positive !    </S>",
    "<S> does a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath0 specify a physical quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time evolution is unitary ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is that if @xmath0 has an unbroken @xmath1 symmetry , then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator @xmath4 . in terms of @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , one can construct a time - independent inner product with a positive - definite norm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the lee model provides an excellent example of a @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized lee - model hamiltonian has a negative - norm `` ghost '' state because renormalization causes the hamiltonian to become non - hermitian . </S>",
    "<S> for the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost , but all such attempts failed . </S>",
    "<S> the correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non - hermitian lee model hamiltonian is @xmath1-symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 operator for the lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm . </S>",
    "<S> the ideas of @xmath1 symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum - mechanical and quantum - field - theoretic models .    </S>",
