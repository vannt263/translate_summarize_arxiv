    "the parton model , according to which hadrons consist of quarks antiquarks and gluons ( partons ) , bound together in different ways , has been very successful in reproducing experiment .",
    "this provides a relatively explicit and transparent technique for the description of high energy particle interactions .",
    "the distributions of partons inside hadrons are characterized by the structure functions satisfying the dokshitzer ",
    "gribov  lipatov ",
    "altarelli  parisi ( dglap ) equations  @xcite or ones that are basically similar .",
    "such a function is the probability density of finding a parton in a hadron carrying a fraction of the total hadron s momentum .",
    "numerical solutions of the equations are in a remarkable agreement with experimental measurements , especially for the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "photons being involved in high energy interactions are also able to manifest hadronic structure .",
    "one can intuitively comprehend this since the photon directly couples to quarks and therefore may split into quark ",
    "antiquark pairs .",
    "the parton contributions in two - photon processes and some crucial peculiarities of the kinematic behavior of the photon structure function have been described by walsh and zerwas  @xcite . the first work in studying quantum - chromodynamics corrections to the naive pointlike structure of the photon belongs to witten @xcite .",
    "this problem was also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . introducing the evolution equations , similar to the dglap ones , for photons as well as the properties of the corresponding solutions",
    "were under scrutiny , for instance , in a series of papers by glk , reya , grassie and vogt  @xcite .",
    "a formulation of high energy @xmath2 interactions taking into account the hadronic properties of the photon was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    today",
    ", we possess convincing experimental evidence for the fact that the real photon has non - trivial parton structure @xcite .    on the other hand , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons may play an important role in the formation of cosmic rays ( cr ) .",
    "one of the brightest representatives is the greisen  zatsepin  kuzmin ( gzk ) limit on the energy of cr  @xcite .",
    "for example , protons of energies of over about @xmath3 ev would be decelerated by interaction with the cmb photons , mostly due to resonant pion production , @xmath4 .",
    "other interesting processes , the @xmath5 reactions and their possible astrophysical implications , were extensively discussed in the literature ( see ,  _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein ) . in this context , to invoke the parton content of the real photon could be convenient for calculations of the probabilities of such processes . here , we attempt to show the example of @xmath0 boson production in the @xmath5 scattering which may have important consequences for astrophysics  @xcite . studying this reaction",
    "could also provide a test of the universality of the parton distribution functions of the photon .",
    "let us first consider inclusive on - shell @xmath0 boson production in the reaction @xmath6 at the resonance region using the parton language",
    ". we will view it from the center - of - mass ( cms ) frame of the @xmath7 system . here , for example , a substantial fraction of the cmb photons will be of energies of about @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the neutrino energy in the laboratory frame defined as the frame in which the cmb is isotropic , @xmath10 is the cmb photon energy ( typical value @xmath11 ev  @xcite ) .",
    "this reaction is standardly factorized into two subprocesses : the emission of a positron by the photon and annihilation of the neutrino with the positron into @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "then the corresponding cross section may be written as      here @xmath13 is the total cms energy squared ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is the probability density function to find the positron in the photon carrying the fraction @xmath16 of the total photon s momentum , and @xmath17 is the cross section of the annihilation subprocess .",
    "note that we explicitly write the @xmath13  dependence of the function instead of the more traditional @xmath18 one ( 4-momentum transfer squared ) since we deal with an @xmath13-channel subprocess .        where @xmath20 is the mass of the @xmath0 boson",
    ", @xmath21 is the partial width of the initial channel ( the partial width for the decay @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 is the total decay width of @xmath0 . in the leading order one can find that @xcite        to determine the function @xmath15 , we adopt the formalism given in ref .",
    "it is fair to expect @xmath15 to satisfy , up to factors associated with the quark colors and fractional electric charges , the same evolution equation as the quark distributions in the photon do , provided the gluons are excluded and one takes into account only the electromagnetic interaction . then ,",
    "in the leading order we write the following equation for the positron distribution  @xcite :                  the dependence of the cross section on @xmath13 is displayed in fig .",
    "2a in comparison with calculations of the closely related process @xmath32 carried out by seckel  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath33 gev , @xmath34 gev@xmath35 , @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the values given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) are about two times higher than those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us turn now to the charged current interaction of the neutrino with the quark content of the photon ( see fig .",
    "the corresponding cross section can be obtained in the same way as it is done for neutrino  proton scattering  @xcite :          where @xmath39 is the probability density to find a quark @xmath40 ( antiquark @xmath41 ) in the photon carrying the fraction @xmath16 of the total photon s momentum .",
    "taking into account only the densities of the lightest quarks @xmath42 and @xmath43 from ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that      here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the electric charge and mass of the quark @xmath40 respectively ( for antiquarks the equation is analogous ) .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) is valid in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "we set @xmath48  gev and @xmath49 .",
    "the dependence of the cross section thus determined on @xmath13 in the range 20 gev@xmath50 @xmath51 1000 gev@xmath50 at some values of @xmath18 is shown in fig .",
    "this reaction may have interesting astrophysical implications because the struck quark may fragment into hadrons .",
    "the latter can be highly boosted and on decaying ( if unstable ) may produce particles with energies exceeding their gzk limit . if it occurs in the vicinity of the earth the decay products may reach us without significant energy loss , provided the incident quark momentum pointed in the direction of the earth .",
    "a similar idea has been proposed , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , when photons would appear beyond the gzk limit from decays of highly boosted @xmath52 , which , in turn , were the decay products of real @xmath53 bosons excited in @xmath54 annihilation ( the so - called `` @xmath55-burst '' mechanism ) .",
    "but there are problems here , mainly associated with the origin of such high energy neutrinos , @xmath56 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our case ,",
    "the minimal neutrino energy required to produce hadrons is smaller than the latter one by about a factor of 400 , and the corresponding cross section is also suppressed by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "anyway , one may expect that these processes were important for high energy neutrino absorption in the early universe .    throughout this paper we implicitly used the assumption that the parton distributions are process ",
    "independent , which has been experimentally justified for the nucleon .",
    "for example , the functions phenomenologically derived from electron  nucleon and neutrino  nucleon deep inelastic scattering data are close to each other . using them",
    "one can correctly predict the probabilities of inclusive production of @xmath58  pairs in @xmath59  collisions ( drell  yan process ) @xcite .",
    "we have discussed only the @xmath7 interactions . meanwhile ,",
    "all the things we said above may be straightforwardly applied to the reactions involving the antineutrino . likewise ,",
    "heavier charged leptons can be considered .",
    "one may also include neutral current interactions in the neutrino ",
    "quark scattering .",
    "other processes involving the cmb photons can be treated in similar way .",
