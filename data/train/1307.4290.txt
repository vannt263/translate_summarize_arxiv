    "the observation of young open clusters in the galaxy is the best tool to examine two issues of interest . first , whether there are differences in the star formation products observed at different locations in the galactic disk .",
    "these differences are best checked in objects where the star formation is recent .",
    "young clusters of ages around 10 myr are best suited for the analysis , since star formation is no longer intensely active and they are reliably observable at both optical and infrared wavelengths . on the other hand , they are still young enough that the observed properties are expected to fairly reflect the main properties of the star formation process , such as initial mass function , presence of massive stars , mass segregation , and spatial distribution of cluster members .",
    "second , the star cluster observation is commonly accepted as the most adequate way to check models of stellar evolution .",
    "young clusters in particular allow us to improve the evolutionary models of pre - main sequence stars ( pms stars in the following ) .",
    "in our project we concentrate on the observation with @xmath6 photometry of clusters in the mentioned age range , with the aim of obtaining pms member samples , mass distributions reasonably complete down to 1m@xmath5 , and an estimate of possible members for lower masses , ( delgado , alfaro & yun 2011 , and their references ) .",
    "this project connects with the aims of the currently ongoing gaia - eso survey ( gilmore et al .",
    "2012 ) , where several of our southern objects of interest are included .",
    "our observations furthermore should enable us to extend the analysis to objects whose membership estimates are expected to highly improve from gaia data , but would not be accessible to spectroscopic observation with the present observational capabilities .",
    "this refers in particular to the clusters berkeley94 and berkeley96 , abbreviated in the following as ber94 and ber96 .",
    "these objects are of particular interest in the context mentioned above , since they have been poorly observed up to now , and are located at relatively far galactocentric distances , in the direction towards the perseus spiral arm of the milky way . ber94 and",
    "ber96 appear to be physically connected to a clusters concentration in the perseus arm , whose more conspicuous object is the star forming and associated hii region sh2 - 132 ( saurin , bica & bonatto 2010 ) .",

    "the calibration in the @xmath15 colors were performed through zero - point shifts , plus a significant colour term , calculated from the stars in common with published photoelectric photometry for both clusters , as given in webda ( wramdemark 1976 , 1978 ; del rio 1984 ) . for the calibration of ber96 colours the stars 7 and 8 in webda were excluded .",
    "they exhibit largely deviating values in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 indices , probably originating in variability or blending errors in the photoelectric values .",

    "the available webda indices , and the location of these stars in the three available colour - magnitude ( cm ) diagrams , @xmath16 vs @xmath23 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , suggests their cluster membership .",
    "the @xmath25 images were obtained with notcam at the not , la palma , using the wide field camera ( 0.234``/pixel , field of view 4 @xmath14 4 ) on 2 september 2007 .",

    "aperture photometry with a radius of 4 pixels was made on all detected sources , and aperture corrections derived from a set of isolated , bright stars was applied .",
    "the 2mass catalogue ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) was used to calibrate photometry and astrometry .",
    "positions are accurate to 0.08 `` in right ascension and declination for ber94 and 0.11 '' for ber96 . we found a systematic shift in offset magnitudes with position on the array",
    ". in the lack of a proper illumination correction model ,",
    "the photometry was calibrated with the empirical slope ( 2@xmath1410@xmath26mag / pixel in y - direction ) plus a median offset found from comparing with 2mass sources of quality flag aaa .",
    "a total of about 30 - 40 calibration stars were used after dismissing doubles unresolved by 2mass . the scatter between notcam and 2mass magnitudes after calibration is 0.06mag in @xmath27 and 0.07mag in @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "the membership of stars located in the upper part of the cm diagram is assigned through fitting the diagrams to the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) . in the calculations we assume that the interstellar reddening in the direction of the clusters is described by an average extinction law ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) with an absorption coefficient @xmath31 , and a reddening slope @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure has been explained in detail by delgado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and applied systematically to several clusters ( delgado , alfaro & yun 2007 , 2011 , referred to in the following as dayi and dayii , respectively ) . this same procedure provides membership estimates for the most luminous stars in the cm diagram , and select those most adequate to measure the cluster age with respect to postms isochrones .",
    "figure[acto96 ] shows as example the procedure for main sequence ( ms ) and post - main sequence ( postms ) members selection applied to ber96 .",
    "stars plotted as grey dots and blue circles in both panels show the first broad selection of ms members , first performed in the @xmath16,@xmath20 cm diagram , and checked afterwards in the remaining cm and colour - colour ( cc ) diagrams to avoid clearly deviating stars in any colour index .",
    "the blue circles and magenta crosses in fig.[acto96 ] are , respectively , the selected unevolved ms cluster members , and the postms members used to calculate cluster age , according to their location in these plots , and also in the other cm diagrams .",
    "the average values of colour excess and distance modulus for the unevolved ms members are adopted for the cluster .",
    "they amount to @xmath33=12.97@xmath10.14 , @xmath2=0.62@xmath10.05 for ber94 and @xmath33=13.16@xmath10.14 , @xmath2=0.58@xmath10.06 for ber96 .",

    "magenta crosses are the stars selected as postms members , used to calculate the cluster age.,width=340,height=396 ]      the procedure to assign membership to pms candidates is the same as for ms stars , but using pms isochrones of ages 1 to 10 myr , instead of the zams , to measure distances of the candidate members . here",
    "we use models by siess , dufour & forestini ( 2000 ) , tognelli , prada - moroni & deglinnocenti ( 2011 ) and yi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in the following",
    "we refer to them as s00 , t11 , and y01 , respectively .",
    "membership is assigned when one or more of these calculated distances coincide with the average distance estimated for ms members .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath20 cc relation is the same as the one for zams , which is a valid assumption for pms stars of class iii and older ( delgado et al .",
    "the median color excess value of all the stars with valid @xmath36-band detection and membership assignment is used as reddening value to calculate the distance modulus of stars without valid @xmath36 measurement .",
    "the membership is checked in all four cm diagrams , available with our @xmath37 photometry .",
    "the final candidate pms members are those stars with assignment in at least 3 cm diagrams , and with photometric error in @xmath16 and in all colour indices smaller than 0.05 mag .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure is given in dayi , and exemplified in figs.4 and 5 of this paper .",
    "as explained above , the standard calibration in the @xmath15 colour indices is based on zero point shift plus colour term from the comparison to published photoelectric photometry for the brightest stars in the field .",
    "the extrapolation to higher magnitudes introduces a higher uncertainty of the member selection for fainter selected members .",
    "this would mainly affect the lower part of our calculated mass distributions . to minimize this uncertainty",
    ", we may consider a reduced pms members sample , which includes only those members with the same age from every cm diagram with assignment , inside 1 myr difference .",
    "we recall that ten pms isochrones are used , with 1myr spacing between them .",
    "we refer to this reduced members sample as pmsr members .",
    "the procedure of pms membership assignment provides ages for the candidate members , and an indication of age dispersion , from the median and mean deviation of all individual age values . these median and deviation amount to 7.0@xmath12.4myr and 6.5@xmath12.2myr for pmsr candidates in ber94 and ber96 , respectively .",
    "two more comments are needed on the pms members selection .",
    "several stars , located at the position of the cm diagram where pms and ms sequences should merge , have membership assignments both as ms members and as pms members around the highest pms ages considered , 8 to 10myr .",
    "we keep as pms candidates those among them fainter than an a0v star at the calculated distance and reddening , whereas those brighter than this limit are adopted as ms candidate members . on the other hand ,",
    "some bright stars are assigned as highly reddened pms members in the youngest isochrones considered , around 3 to 1myr . in the cm diagrams they are located at similar @xmath16 as the ms candidates .",
    "some unquantifiable contamination might be present here , by binary stars , highly reddened ms members , or even foreground stars of later spectral type .",
    "we finally mention here the absence of any @xmath38 excess in the proposed pms sequences of both clusters .",
    "a single exception is star 83 in ber96 , which we comment later , in sect.3.5 below .",
    "the index @xmath38 can be used as indicator of @xmath39 emission , thus helping in the identification of possible pms cluster members ( sung , chun & bessell 2000 ) . in the present case ,",
    "no sign of an excess in this index is found .",
    "this indicates the practical absence of any remainings of disk or envelope material around the pms candidates , as compared to the results found in younger clusters ( yun et al .",
    "this absence , together with the lack of other possible pms features , such as @xmath4 near infrared ( nir ) excess , strongly depends on the age of the pms candidates , and is actually expected in clusters of ages similar to those obtained for ber94 and ber96 .",
    "the optical catalogue is matched with 2mass data , to obtain astrometry with precission of 0.08 arcsec in both coordinates .",
    "together with the matching of the nir photometric catalogue ( see sect.2.2 above ) a complete catalogue of @xmath37 and @xmath40 colours is obtained .",

    "this supports the reliability of the method of membership assignment .",
    "even the spatial distribution of the nir - excess sources appears concentrated in this location , which suggests that an important fraction of these sources could be low mass cluster members , highly reddened and not visible at optical wavelengths . on the other hand , the maps in fig.[spatial ]",
    "show different distributions for candidate members in different mass ranges .",
    "average masses amount to 7.92 @xmath53 , 2.30 @xmath53 , for the ms+postms , and pms members in ber94 , and 7.46 @xmath53 and 2.05 @xmath53 for the same members in ber96 .",
    "average masses of the nir excess sources plotted in the respective rightmost plots in fig.[nircccm ] are not quantitativeley determined .",
    "as commented above , those cluster members among these sources would have masses around 0.5 @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 , based on the so - called minimum spanning tree ( mst ) , allows us to quantify the degree of mass segregation in a cluster and to examine how mass segregation changes for different ranges of stellar masses ( allison et al .",
    "the details of the spatial structure are described with the parameter q ( cartwright & whitworth 2004 ) for several subsets of cluster members .",
    "values of q and @xmath54 have been calculated for different mass intervals , starting with the 5 most massive stars , and adding three members in order of decreasing mass in each new calculation .",

    "the limiting value q@xmath560.80 would separate radial from fractal spatial distributions ( cartwright & whitworth 2004 ) . in this context",
    "we recall the important bias that spatial outliers could introduce on the estimation of q. in our clusters this effect is however negligible .",
    "the calculation of q values with rejection of the outmost 2 percent of stars ( parker & meyer 2012 ) leads to the same results as those shown in the lower panel of fig.[lambdaq ] .",

    "ascenso et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have suggested that crowding could lead to undetection of relatively faint members , thereby biasing the results towards and overestimate of mass segregation of the most massive and bright members .",
    "their conclusions mainly apply to the effects of important crowding in massive clusters , and can be considered to affect little to our clusters , which are one order of magnitude less massive and clearly less crowded ( fig.[mapas ] ) than those simulated by these authors .",
    "however , @xmath54 parameter is very sensitive to the presence of outliers , in the sense that just one single star well separated from a high concentration of objects with similar masses could hide the mass - segregation effect , moving the @xmath54 parameter to values close to 1 .",

    "( 2011 ) discuss how the methodology proposed by allison et al .",
    "( 2009 ) works well under some specific conditions but fails when dealing with samples including a few outliers .",
    "the solution proposed by these authors is to use the median instead the mean when determining the central value of the mst `` edge length '' distribution .",
    "we have analyzed both clusters with this procedure by calculating @xmath57 within a sequence of different mass ranges ( instead of calculating a measure for all stars from the most massive down to the i - th most massive candidate members ) and representing them versus the mass average in each interval .",
    "we have repeated the the @xmath54 and q calculations with 25 stars per bin , the number of stars per bin also selected for the study of the mass function .",
    "the results are shown in figure[l25 ] , where error bars represent the edge length dispersion divided by the edge length mean of the 25 random stars for each mass interval .",
    "the presence of a weak but statistically significant mass segregation in both clusters for stars more massive than 6 m@xmath5 solar masses can be inferred from these plots , a result which supports the conclusions from fig.[lambdaq ] .    in the calculation of q for different mass intervals , using this same procedure , we must consider the dependence that the results might have on the inclusion of certain stars in any of two adjacent mass bins .",
    "the calculation in moving mass bins , with 25 stars per bin and steps of 5 stars , produces the results shown in figure[q25 ] .",
    "they show that ber96 is radially distributed , with q values above 0.9 for the massive stars , whereas the opposite is observed for the most massive candidate members in ber94 , which exhibit a significant degree of structure .",

    "horizontal lines mark the separation of spherically symmetric and substructured distribution ( q=0.8).,width=377,height=453 ]    the differences in geometry can be interpreted on the basis of the results from theoretical simulations ( parker & meyer 2012 ) .",
    "the initial energy balance at the start of cluster formation can be characterized by the ratio q@xmath58 = t/@xmath59| , where t and @xmath60 are the total kinetic and potential energy of the stars , respectively .",
    "a fractal cluster initially supervirial ( q@xmath61 0.5 ) would evolve expanding , but also keeping a high degree of substructure , visualized by the variation of q , which remains well below the cut - off value of 0.8 up to 10 myr ( warm collapse ) . on the other hand , a similar cluster which starts with subvirial energetic balance ( q@xmath62 0.5 ) would undergo a `` cold '' collapse , where the initial structure is rapidly erased , and massive stars are concentrated towards the cluster center .",
    "ber94 and ber96 could be representatives of these two different dynamical evolutive paths .",
    "as it can be seen in fig.[lambdaq ] , ber94 shows a distribution of the massive component with a high degree of structure ( q@xmath55 0.70 ) and is at the same time centrally concentrated .",
    "this could be explained by an early dynamical evolution under a supervirial regime . in the case of ber96",
    ", its main characteristics suggest that the cluster has undergone a `` cold '' collapse instead .",
    "we remark that the present data do not allow us to make any inference about whether some primordial mass segregation was present in the clusters .      a thorough analysis of the mass distribution in a cluster , and",
    "its completeness must take into account the influence of biases affecting the member selection and the mass assignments to them .",
    "furthermore , even if the obtained mass distribution can be considered reasonably complete in the pertinent mass range , its interpretation in terms of a mass function established by the physics of the formation process needs consideration of several sources of bias of different qualities and importance ( kroupa et al .",
    "2011 , k11 in the following ) .    among the biases described in k11 , those biases that influence the actual calculation of a mass distribution from observed quantities are meant to be alleviated by our procedure .",
    "the restriction in age , colour excess and location in the galaxy used to select our clusters are expected to minimize biases that arise from high and differential reddening , or crowding .",
    "a more persistent source of bias would indeed be the presence of unresolved multiple stars among the cluster members .",
    "on the other hand , the application of restrictions in the members selection , considering masses above an approximated completeness limit , and the use of equally populated bins in the calculation ( maz - apellniz & beda 2005 ) are aimed at obtaining results as representative as possible of the actual mass distributions of the clusters .        with the calculated distance and colour excess , an approximate degree of completeness can be estimated .",
    "for each cluster , we estimate this level to be at the star whose absolute magnitude in the 5myr pms isochrone , added to the apparent distance modulus of the cluster ( 3.1@xmath63 ) , equals the faintest magnitude of all observed stars with photometric errors in @xmath16 and in all four colour indices below 0.05 mag . the corresponding limiting mass amounts to 1.30m@xmath46 and 1.35m@xmath46 in ber94 and ber96 , respectively . in practice , this includes all assigned member stars which also have detection in all bands ( see sect .",
    "3.2 above ) .    in figure[massdist ]",
    "we plot the obtained mass distributions for both clusters , with use of g02 and s00 models .",
    "the slopes and uncertainties are quoted .",
    "the slopes are to be compared with the one of the salpeter function in linear form , _ dn@xmath64/dm@xmath65m@xmath66 _",
    "( maz - apellniz & beda 2005 ) .",
    "a marginal overnumber of detected lower mass members could be present in ber96 , leading to a relatively steeper distribution .",
    "a general agreement inside the uncertainties is found between the slopes of the mass distributions from s00 models and the salpeter ( 1955 ) mass function slope .",
    "the total masses of the proposed candidate members amount to 654@xmath118 and 685@xmath153 m@xmath5 for ber94 and ber96 , respectively .",
    "an estimate of the total mass , from our approximate limit , 1.3 m@xmath5 down to 0.01 m@xmath5 , requires the assumption of a mass function . the kroupa ( 2002 )",
    "mass function leads to respective values for ber94 and ber96 of 2786 and 3455 m@xmath5 .",
    "lower and upper limits , calculated with consideration of the uncertainties given for the slopes , amount to 1535 , 6622 m@xmath5 for ber94 , and 1934 , 8151 m@xmath5 for ber96 , which leave the total masses practically undetermined .",
    "we note however that the central total values calculated with the slopes proposed by weidner , kroupa & pflamm - altenburg ( 2013 ) are sensibly smaller , with respective values of 1612 and 1897 m@xmath5 for ber94 and ber96 .",
    "1 .   photometric magnitudes and colours in the @xmath37 and @xmath25 systems",
    "are presented for 6150 stars in the fields of the galactic open clusters berkeley94 and berkeley96 .",

    "berkeley96 is found to be significantly younger than berkeley94 , with respective ages , logage(yr)=7.0@xmath10.07 and logage(yr)=7.5@xmath10.07 .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the respective numbers of assigned pms members , and follows the trend between pms member number and cluster age found previously ( dayii ) .",
    "3 .   a population of sources with nir excess in the @xmath4 index is found in both fields . from their location in the @xmath16,@xmath19 cm diagram , for the fraction that is optically visible , and mainly from the spatial distribution that they exhibit , we suggest that some of them could represent the lowest mass end of the cluster member sequence .",
    "the suggestion is particularly strong in the case of the younger berkeley96 , where the number of nir - excess sources found is correspondingly higher .",
    "this would imply the presence in the cluster of member stars of age around 10 myr , covering a mass range of 2 orders of magnitude , from around 27 to 0.2m@xmath5 .",
    "the spatial distributions of candidate members in various mass ranges suggest different initial conditions and formation processes in these clusters . a quantitative analysis of the features observed in the obtained spatial distribution ,",
    "is performed according to published numerical simulations of cluster evolution .",
    "the results suggest the presence of mass segregation in both clusters . on the other hand we could be witnessing results of the so - called `` warm '' and `` cold '' collapse models , which would be represented in the respective formation and dynamical evolution of berkeley94 and berkeley96 .",
