    "similarly , one can use ghouila - houri s theorem to deduce that every digraph on @xmath10 vertices with minimum semidegree greater than @xmath1 is pancyclic . in both cases , the complete bipartite ( di-)graph whose vertex class sizes are as equal as possible shows that the bound is best possible .",

    "these perfect matchings ( for all clusters @xmath111 ) together with all the edges of @xmath2 fixed so far form a @xmath54-factor @xmath326 of @xmath2 .",
    "it remains to transform @xmath326 into a hamilton cycle .",
    "we claim that for any cluster @xmath111 , we can find a perfect matching @xmath327 in @xmath322 so that if we replace @xmath325 in @xmath326 with @xmath327 , then all vertices of @xmath322 will lie on a common cycle in the new @xmath54-factor  @xmath326 .",
    "to prove this claim we proceed as follows .",
    "for every @xmath328 , we move along the cycle @xmath329 of @xmath326 containing @xmath35 ( starting at @xmath35 ) and let @xmath330 be the first vertex on @xmath329 in @xmath331 .",
    "define an auxiliary digraph @xmath332 on @xmath333 such that @xmath334 .",
    "so @xmath332 is obtained by identifying each pair @xmath335 into one vertex with an edge from @xmath335 to @xmath336 if @xmath322 has an edge from @xmath330 to @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath322 is super - regular , it follows that @xmath332 is also super - regular . by lemma  [ fk ]",
    ", @xmath332 has a hamilton cycle , which clearly corresponds to a perfect matching @xmath327 in  @xmath322 with the desired property .",
    "we now repeatedly apply the above claim to every cluster . since @xmath321 for each cluster",
    "@xmath111 , this ensures that all vertices which lie in clusters on the same cycle of @xmath46 will lie on the same cycle of the new @xmath54-factor @xmath326 .",
    "since by  ( a ) @xmath293 visits all clusters , this in turn implies that all the non - exceptional vertices will lie in the same cycle of @xmath326 .",
    "since the exceptional vertices form an independent set in  @xmath337 , it follows that @xmath337 is actually a hamilton cycle .",
    "here we give proofs of theorems  [ cover ] and  [ regularii ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ cover ] uses theorems  [ kellythm ] and  [ expanderthm ] .    *",
    "proof of theorem  [ cover ] . *",
    "choose new constants @xmath338 such that @xmath339 .",
    "consider any regular tournament @xmath2 on @xmath195 vertices .",
    "apply theorem  [ kellythm ] to @xmath2 in order to obtain a collection @xmath340 of at least @xmath143 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles .",
    "let @xmath46 be the undirected graph consisting of all those edges of @xmath2 which are not covered by the hamilton cycles in  @xmath340 .",
    "note that @xmath46 is @xmath17-regular for some @xmath341 . by vizing s theorem",
    "the edges of @xmath46 can be coloured with at most @xmath342 colours and thus @xmath46 can be decomposed into at most @xmath343 matchings .",
    "split each of these matchings into at most @xmath344 edge - disjoint matchings , each containing at most @xmath345 edges .",
    "so altogether this yields a collection @xmath346 of at most @xmath347 matchings covering all edges of  @xmath46 .",
    "it is enough to show that for each @xmath348 there exists a hamilton cycle of @xmath2 which contains all the edges in  @xmath349 .",
    "so consider any @xmath348 .",
    "as observed in  @xcite ( see the proof of corollary  16 there ) , any regular tournament is a robust @xmath249-outexpander .",
    "let @xmath114 be the digraph obtained from @xmath2 by ` contracting ' all the edges in  @xmath349 , i.e.  by successively replacing each edge @xmath350 with a vertex @xmath351 whose inneighbourhood is the inneighbourhood of @xmath38 and whose outneighbourhood is the outneighbourhood of @xmath42 . using that @xmath349 consists of at most @xmath345 edges and that @xmath352 , it is not hard to check that @xmath114 is still a robust @xmath282-outexpander and @xmath353 .",
    "so theorem  [ expanderthm ] implies that @xmath114 contains a hamilton cycle , which corresponds to a hamilton cycle in  @xmath2 containing all edges of  @xmath349 , as required .",
    "note that we can not simply apply theorem  [ main ] instead of theorem  [ expanderthm ] at the end of the proof , because @xmath114 may not been an oriented graph .",
    "however , instead of using theorem  [ expanderthm ] , one can also use the following result of thomassen  @xcite : for every set @xmath232 of @xmath354 independent edges in a regular tournament on @xmath10 vertices , there is a hamilton cycle which contains all edges in @xmath232 .",
    "theorem  [ regularii ] can be proved in a similar way , using ghouila - houri s theorem instead of theorem  [ expanderthm ] .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ regularii ] .",
    "* choose a new constant @xmath355 such that @xmath356 and apply theorem  [ regular ] to find a collection of at least @xmath357 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the subgraph of @xmath2 consisting of all edges not lying in these hamilton cycles .",
    "then @xmath46 is @xmath17-regular for some @xmath358 .",
    "choose a collection @xmath346 of matchings covering all edges of @xmath46 as in the the proof of theorem  [ cover ] .",
    "so each matching consists of at most @xmath359 edges .",
    "as before , for each @xmath360 it suffices to find a hamilton cycle of @xmath2 containing all edges of @xmath349 .",
    "let @xmath361 be the digraph obtained from @xmath2 by orienting each edge in @xmath349 and replacing each edge in @xmath362 with two edges , one in each direction .",
    "let @xmath114 be the digraph obtained from @xmath361 by ` contracting ' the edges in @xmath349 as in the the proof of theorem  [ cover ] .",
    "then @xmath361 has minimum semidegree at least @xmath1 and thus contains a hamilton cycle by ghouila - houri s theorem ( theorem  [ hamgh ] ) .",
    "this hamilton cycle corresponds to a hamilton cycle in  @xmath2 containing all edges of  @xmath349 , as required .",
