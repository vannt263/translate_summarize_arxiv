    "spintronics is a rapidly developing research area of modern solid state physics .",
    "in contrast to traditional electronics , where the electric charge of electrons is in focus , the field of spintronics relies on another fundamental property of electrons , _ viz . _ their magnetic moment , which is associated with their spin degree of freedom .",
    "issues related to the electrical control of spin currents as well as to spin control of charge currents are at the heart of spintronics research today , both from a fundamental and an applied perspective @xcite .",
    "recently it has been suggested that such controls may be effectively implemented in nanodevices containing an electric weak link with strong spin - orbit interactions ( soi ) that bridges bulk electrodes @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that a spin - orbit coupling results in a  splitting \" of the spin of electrons passing through such a weak link ( rashba spin splitting ) , which under certain conditions may generate a spin current .",
    "this was shown to occur if an imbalance of the population of spin states in the electrodes is established by spin - flip assisted electronic transitions due to the absorption ( or emission ) of circularly polarized photons created by microwave pumping @xcite .",
    "the soi - induced spin generation inside the weak link makes it a point - like source of a spin current due to a photo - spintronic effect on the nanometer length scale .",
    "estimations show , however , that if the soi is caused by an external electric field , as implicitly assumed in @xcite , that field has to be quite strong for the induced rashba spin splitting to be significant .",
    "the aim of the present work is to demonstrate that a much stronger photo - spintronic transduction effect can be achieved if a material with an intrinsic soi , here assumed to be induced by stresses , is used for the weak link .",
    "the precise form of the stress - induced soi depends on the material used for the electric weak link and the type of strains involved . in a single - wall carbon nanotube , which will be considered here",
    ", the strain can be thought of as occurring when a graphene ribbon is rolled up to form a tube .",
    "the strain - induced soi in a simple one - dimensional model of such a nanotube is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fermi velocity , @xmath2 is a phenomenological parameter that gives the strength of the soi in units of inverse length , @xmath3 is a vector whose components are the pauli matrices @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a unit vector pointing along the longitudinal axis of the nanotube in the direction of electron propagation ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "equation ( [ hamstrain ] ) , which was used in ref . , is a simplified form of the soi hamiltonian previously derived for a realistic model of such a nanotube @xcite .",
    "the soi active weak - link device shown in fig .  1 comprises a nanowire that bridges two bulk electronic reservoirs .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction described by eq .",
    "( [ hamstrain ] ) is restricted to the nanowire and has the effect of scattering the spins of electrons that pass through the wire . following the approach developed in refs .",
    "we will describe the transfer of electrons through the nanowire - based weak link with the help of a spin - dependent tunnel hamiltonian .",
    "hence , the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as a sum of three parts , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are hamiltonians that describe the electrons in the left and right leads .",
    "these electrons are characterized by the momentum quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and by the spin projection on the @xmath11axis .",
    "we label the latter by @xmath12 , so that the spin projections are @xmath13 .",
    "the tunnel hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the probability amplitudes @xmath14^{}_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}$ ] for electron transmission through the wire , @xmath15^{}_{\\sigma',\\sigma}c^{}_{{\\bf k}\\sigma}+{\\rm h.c.})\\ . \\label{ht}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these amplitudes have to be calculated taking the spin dynamics given by hamiltonian ( [ hamstrain ] ) into account .     and @xmath16 with the @xmath17axis , respectively , while the plane that contains the nanowire is tilted by an angle @xmath18 away from the @xmath19axis towards the @xmath11axis",
    ". the device is irradiated by circularly - polarized microwave radiation ( wavy arrows ) that creates a difference in the population of spin - up and spin - down electrons ( thick vertical arrows ) corresponding to a  spin biasing \" of the device .",
    "spin - flip transitions induced by the spin - orbit interaction in the nanowire create a spin current @xmath20 traveling out from the wire with a magnitude that depends on the angles @xmath21 and @xmath18 .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "electronic transport through the weak link shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] can be induced in a number of different ways .",
    "the standard method would be to apply a voltage bias @xmath22 across the link , so that the chemical potentials for electrons in the left and right reservoirs are shifted by a small amount @xmath23 with respect to each other .",
    "the result of such _ charge biasing _ is that excess charge of opposite polarity is accumulated on either side of the link , which leads to an electrical current through the link in a direction that counters the bias - induced charge imbalance .",
    "another method , which will be in focus here and which is illustrated in fig .  1 , is to arrange for the chemical potential to be different for the two possible projections of the electron spin along a certain axis .",
    "spin biasing _ can be achieved by illuminating the entire device with circularly - polarized microwave radiation of a frequency that enables electron spin - flip assisted photon absorption .",
    "this photonic pumping of the electronic spin creates an imbalance between the number of electrons with opposite spin projections on an axis defined by the direction of the radiation and leads to a spin - dependent shift in the chemical potentials for electrons with opposite spin projections .",
    "the magnitude of the shift , which extends throughout the device , depends on the intensity of the radiation and on the spin relaxation rate .",
    "if we assume that the soi , which is restricted to the weak link , is the dominant spin relaxation mechanism the soi becomes a source of a spin current , which flows out of the weak link into the two reservoirs and which counteracts the spin pumping . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we note that both the orientation of the plane that contains the weak link with respect to the pumped spin orientation and the bending angle of the link can be used to tune the generated spin current .",
    "the spin bias @xmath24 can be defined by noting that for @xmath25 the electron spin reservoirs are described by fermi - dirac distributions with different chemical potentials , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the chemical potential of both leads at equilibrium .",
    "the spin current generated by electrons tunneling out of the soi - active weak link can be obtained as the time derivative of the total spin , @xmath29 , of the electrons , @xmath30 where @xmath31 a straightforward calculation of the spin current ( [ spincurrent ] ) can be done using the tunnel hamiltonian ( [ hamstrain ] ) to lowest order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "then , one finds for the spin conductance @xmath32 ( defined in analogy with the electrical conductance @xmath33 ) the relation @xmath34",
    "in order to calculate the spin current given by eq .",
    "( [ spincurrent ] ) one needs to evaluate the electronic transmission amplitudes @xmath14^{}_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}$ ] , which appear in the tunnel hamiltonian ( [ ht ] ) , and specifically their dependence on the spin - orbit interaction as given by eq .",
    "( [ hamstrain ] ) . in our simple model",
    "the weak link consists of two straight parts of equal length @xmath35 joined by a bend . neglecting the momentum ( but not the spin ) dependence ,",
    "the probability amplitude for an electron of energy @xmath36 to pass from , say , the left to the right lead can be written as a product of five factors , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a 2@xmath392 matrix in spin space , @xmath40 is the probability amplitude to tunnel from the wire to the left ( right ) lead and @xmath41 is the transfer matrix through the bend in the wire . in ref .",
    "the green s function @xmath42 for the straight segments of the wire , in which the soi interaction takes place , was evaluated for a hamiltonian of the form @xmath43 a comparison with eq .",
    "( [ hamstrain ] ) shows that in the present case @xmath44 .",
    "hence , from eqs .",
    "( a12 ) and ( a13 ) of ref .",

    "it follows that we can factor out the dependence on the soi and write the amplitude given by eq .",
    "( [ 5factors ] ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the soi - independent part and @xmath51 [ \\cos(\\alpha ) -i \\sin(\\alpha ) \\hat{\\bf   n}^{}_l \\cdot \\sig ] \\label{calw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contains the effect of the soi .    in our geometry",
    "the @xmath11axis is the spin quantization axis , and the bent wire lies in a plane that ( i ) contains the @xmath17axis and ( ii ) is rotated by an angle @xmath18 away from the @xmath19axis towards the @xmath11axis . in the plane of the wire , the left ( right ) straight leg of the wire forms an angle @xmath21 ( -@xmath21 ) with the @xmath17axis . in other words , @xmath52\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ \\hat { \\bf n}^{}_r & = \\cos(\\theta ) \\hat { \\bf x } - \\sin(\\theta ) [ \\cos(\\gamma ) \\hat{\\bf   y } + \\sin(\\gamma ) \\hat { \\bf z } ] \\ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which means that we can write eq .",

    "the strength of the soi , characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath59 , determines the amount of photo - spintronic transduction that can be achieved by the studied rashba spin - splitter device .",
