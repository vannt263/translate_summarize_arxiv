    "to date , luminous extragalactic h@xmath7o masers can be grouped into three classes : those tracing accretion disks ( e.g.  ngc  4258 ) ; those in which the emission is either the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching molecular cloud or an accidental overlap , along the line - of - sight , between a warm dense molecular cloud and the radio continuum of the jet ( e.g.  ngc  1052 and mrk  348 ) ; those related to prominent sites of star formation , such as the ones observed in m  33 ( the earliest known extragalactic h@xmath7o masers ) , and later also in ic  10 .",
    "extragalactic h@xmath7o masers are preferentially detected in nearby galaxies that are bright in the infrared ( @xcite ) .",
    "while nuclear masers are of obvious interest , non - nuclear masers are also important for a number of reasons : these sources allow us to pinpoint sites of massive star formation , to measure the velocity vectors of these regions through vlbi proper motion studies , and to determine true distances through complementary measurements of proper motion and radial velocity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have therefore observed the nearby spiral galaxies ic  342 and maffei  2 , both of which exhibit prominent nuclear bars and strong molecular , infrared , and radio continuum emission . in the following we report the results of our observations .",
    "the @xmath8 line of h@xmath7o ( rest frequency : 22.23508ghz ) was observed with the 100-m telescope of the mpifr at effelsberg toward maffei  2 and ic  342 .",
    "the full width to half power beamwidth was 40 .",
    "the observations were carried out in a dual beam switching mode with a beam throw of 2  and a switching frequency of @xmath01hz .",
    "the pointing accuracy was always better than 10 .    on may 12 , 2001 , ic  342",
    "was observed with the very large array ( vla ) in its b configuration .",
    "the 103 channels used , out of the 128 observed , cover a range in velocity of @xmath08kms@xmath1 centered at 16kms@xmath1 lsr ( the velocity of the line detected at effelsberg ) .",
    "no continuum subtraction was needed .",
    "the data were deconvolved using the clean algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the restoring beam is @xmath9 and the rms noise per channel is @xmath010mjy , consistent with the expected thermal noise .",
    "our single - dish observations towards maffei  2 yielded no detection , with a 5@xmath10 upper limit of 25mjy ( channel spacing : 1.05kms@xmath1 ; velocity range : 250kms@xmath1 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 + 230kms@xmath1 ; epoch : apr 3 , 2001 ; position : @xmath13 = 02@xmath14 41@xmath15 55@xmath162 , @xmath17 = + 59@xmath18 36@xmath19 11@xmath20 ) .    o maser feature observed with high velocity resolution ( channel spacings after smoothing four contiguous channels are 0.26kms@xmath1 ) on * a ) * april 3 , * b ) * april 22 , * c ) * may 7 , and * d ) * june 22 .",
    "the first spectrum has been taken at the ( 0,0 ) position , the others at ( 10,0 ) relative to the position given in footnote ` a ' of table 1 .",

    "positions are offsets relative to and .",
    "note that the spacing between two individual spectra ( 20 ) is approximately half of the size of the 100-m effelsberg telescope beam at 22ghz ( 40 ) . averaging four contiguous channels ,",
    "the spectra have been smoothed to a spacing of 0.26  kms@xmath1 .",
    "[ map],width=453 ]    on april 2 , 2001 , we obtained the first definite detection of water vapor emission in ic  342 . during the next night",
    "the detection was confirmed with a velocity resolution sufficient to resolve the line profile ( fig.[flare]a ) .",
    "the detected feature lies at @xmath21 = 16kms@xmath1 and has a linewidth of @xmath00.5kms@xmath1 ; on april 2 , no other component was seen at velocities 175kms@xmath1 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 + 310kms@xmath1 ( channel spacing : 1.05kms@xmath1 ; 5@xmath10 noise level : 16mjy ) . a high line intensity ( @xmath0100mjy ) and good weather conditions allowed us to map the emitting region ( fig.[map ] ) .",
    "further measurements were performed on april 22 and may 7 ( fig.[flare]b&[flare]c ) .",
    "it is noticeable a fading in the peak and integrated intensities and a blue - shift in the velocity of the line by @xmath01kms@xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , no emission above @xmath030mjy ( 3@xmath10 level ; 0.08kms@xmath1 channel spacing ) was detected in the 22  ghz vla b - array data taken on may 12 .",
    "this fading by at least a factor of 3 within 5 days implies a size scale of @xmath22@xmath23 cm ( @xmath22900au ) or @xmath220.5mas at a distance of 1.8mpc ( @xcite ; see also sect.4.3 ) ; the corresponding brightness temperature is @xmath2410@xmath25k .",
    "the most recent spectrum was obtained on june 22 at effelsberg ( fig.[flare]d ) . confirming the vla result ,",
    "no maser signal was seen above 30mjy ( 3@xmath10 ; channel spacing : 1.05kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "fitting a synthetic gaussian to the data taken on april 3 ( see fig.[map ] ) , i.e. minimizing the sum of the difference squared between calculated and observed peak and integrated flux densities , we can obtain an accurate position of the emitting region : @xmath13 = 03@xmath14 46@xmath15 463 , @xmath17 = + 68@xmath18 0546 .",
    "this is 13  to the west of our center position that coincides with the optical nucleus and the 2@xmath26 m peak @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the derived maser position has been estimated to be @xmath0 5 .",

    "[ mappadss ] shows an optical b - band image of the central region of ic  342 , taken from the xdss .",
    "the maser emitting region ( white circle ) coincides with an arc - like structure extending e - s and is associated with a chain of sources that appear to be hii regions .",
    "occasionally , prominent galactic star forming regions show narrow ( @xmath00.5 kms@xmath1 ) flaring components that are exceptionally bright .",
    "such flares were observed in w31a and w49 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the prototype of these flares is the 8kms@xmath1 super maser in orion - kl ( e.g.  @xcite ) . during several months ,",
    "the narrow highly linearly polarized maser reached flux densities in excess of 5mjy . surpassing the flux of any other velocity component by more than an order of magnitude and reaching a peak luminosity of @xmath27 @xmath0 10@xmath2l@xmath3 , the feature seems to be similar to that seen in ic  342 . while luminosity , linewidth , and flux variations",
    "are reminiscent of the 8kms@xmath1 super maser in orion - kl , our h@xmath7o profiles show a significant velocity shift between april 22 and may 7 ( figs .",
    "[ flare]b and c ) that has not been seen in the orion - kl flaring component . a simple model for explaining both the flare and the shift is , in our opinion , that the latter has a kinematic origin . adopting a scenario of a chance alignment of two masing clouds along the line - of - sight , motion of the foreground relative to the background cloud along the plane of the sky and velocity structure in the foreground cloud",
    "could explain the observed data .",
    "a velocity gradient in the foreground cloud would then first shift the line velocity ; once velocities are reached that are not matched within the background cloud , the flux density of the maser rapidly drops . assuming that the distance between these clouds is @xmath281.8mpc and that their relative velocity in the plane of the sky is at the order of 100kms@xmath1 , this implies a cloud velocity gradient of up to 1kms@xmath1/au during the time the source was monitored .",
    "an almost identical scenario was proposed by @xcite to account for the velocity shift of the flaring water maser component at 66kms@xmath1 in w49n .",
    "the similarity in velocity shift ( @xmath0 0.5kms@xmath1 ) and time scale ( 58 days ) of the event in w49n w.r.t the one in ic  342 , indicates a common origin .",
    "while typical searches for extragalactic maser sources have only yielded detection rates between zero ( e.g.  @xcite ) and a few percent ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , there exists one sample with detection rates @xmath610% : these are the northern ( @xmath29 @xmath6 30@xmath18 ) extragalactic iras ( infrared astronomy satellite ) point sources with 100@xmath26 m fluxes in excess of 50jy ( for a source list , see @xcite ; maffei 2 with @xmath5 @xmath0 200jy should be added to the list ) .",
    "there is a total of 44 galaxies , two ultraluminous galaxies at intermediate distances ( ngc3690 and arp220 ) and 42 nearby sources ( @xmath12 @xmath11 3000kms@xmath1 ) . among these ,",
    "seven ( 16% ) are known to contain h@xmath7o masers in their nuclear region .",
    "two of these contain megamasers ( ngc  1068 and ngc  3079 ) , two are possibly nuclear kilomasers ( ngc  253 and m  51 ; for details , see sect.1 ) , and three are associated with prominent sites of star formation ( ic  10 , ic  342 , m  82 ) . among the subsample of 19 sources with 100@xmath26 m fluxes in excess of 100jy , five",
    "were so far detected in h@xmath7o , yielding a detection rate in excess of 20% . since",
    "few deep integrations have been obtained toward these sources , more h@xmath7o detections can be expected from this promising sample in the near future .    we wish to thank nikolaus neininger for useful discussion .",
    "we are also endebted to the operators at the 100-m telescope , and to michael rupen and the nrao analysts , for their cheerful assistance with the observations ."
