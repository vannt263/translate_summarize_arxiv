    "the value @xmath258 ergs - cm@xmath21-s@xmath1 used above is a characteristic value for the coronal energy loss .",
    "the value of this loss varies over the surface of the sun .",

    "( [ 200 ] ) gives values for @xmath270 , and 82 times larger than the value inferred from judge & carlsson ( 2010 ) .",
    "given observational and model uncertainties , this suggests type 2 spicules may make a significant contribution to coronal energy input in quiet sun regions , possibly also in coronal holes , but not in active regions .      for this solution @xmath271 g and @xmath272 km .",
    "then @xmath273 g. the increase in @xmath90 by a factor of 2 requires that @xmath45 be reduced by a factor of 4 to keep @xmath44 . for the bg state @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "plots for solution 2 are not included because they are similar in shape to those for solution 1 .",
    "the flow is localized within a diameter @xmath276 km .",
    "the maximum of @xmath49 is 77.5 km - s@xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath277 , the maximum of @xmath49 is 397.2 km - s@xmath1 .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath278 , and @xmath211 during the main phase of the acceleration are roughly 4 , 30 - 40 , 10 , and 4 - 5 times their values for solution 1 .    here",
    "@xmath279 ergs .",
    "then @xmath280 of the magnetic energy of @xmath281 ergs that is expended in accelerating the plasma and heating it by resistive dissipation is converted into bulk flow kinetic energy .",
    "about 97% of @xmath194 is due to pedersen current dissipation .",
    "the total thermal energy generated by joule and viscous dissipation is @xmath282 greater than the net cooling due to rarefaction .",
    "the estimated mass and energy fluxes into the corona are @xmath283 @xmath284 @xmath285 , and @xmath286 for @xmath258 ergs - cm@xmath21-s@xmath1 .",
    "the energy injected into the corona is @xmath287 times less than for solution 1 , and the required value of @xmath254 is correspondingly @xmath288 times larger .",
    "the larger contribution of solution 1 to the coronal energy input is due to the larger diameter of the region where the acceleration and heating are concentrated .",
    "an important unknown quantity is the occurrence frequency of spicules as a function of their diameter and energy content .",
    "the hi viscous force can have a strong braking effect on type 2 spicule acceleration if it is driven by lorentz forces associated with current densities localized within diameters @xmath289 km , corresponding to @xmath290 for the values of @xmath45 used here .",
    "if the actual characteristic radii within which the current density is localized are much larger , then the effect of viscous braking is expected to be significantly smaller .",
    "this follows from a dimensionless form of the momentum eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , which shows that the lorentz force is @xmath291 , while the viscous force is @xmath292 , where @xmath293 is a reynold s number , and @xmath294 is a characteristic density .",
    "then if all other input parameters are held constant , the ratio of the lorentz force to the viscous force is @xmath295 .",
    "the maximum vertical speeds of @xmath68 and 77 km - s@xmath1 for the solutions presented here are at the lower end of type 2 spicule speeds .",
    "significantly higher speeds might be possible in models not restricted to using values of @xmath45 sufficiently small so the effects of @xmath42 in the momentum equation can be neglected .",
    "joule and compressive heating dominate during the early stage of acceleration .",
    "viscous heating dominates at later times when velocity gradients are largest , but the cooling rate due to rarefaction , corresponding to @xmath296 , more than cancels this heating rate .",
    "the total thermal energy generated by viscous dissipation during the acceleration process is an order of magnitude larger than that due to joule dissipation , but the total cooling due to rarefaction can be comparable to or larger in magnitude than this energy . these are crude estimates since the model does not include an energy equation .",
    "if all the upward spicule energy flux in the upper chromosphere contributes to coronal energy input , the energy injected by type 2 spicules into the corona may provide a significant fraction of the coronal energy input in quiet regions , possibly also in coronal holes , but not in active regions .",
    "magnetic flux emergence through the photosphere in inter - granular lanes is a likely source of non - force free current systems that accelerate type 2 spicules through the associated lorentz force .",
    "this conclusion is based on the following complementary sets of observations , and on the mhd simulations cited in  2.2 .",
    "( 1 ) type 2 spicules are localized on scales @xmath106 km perpendicular to their direction , consistent with inter - granular lane spatial scales .",
    "( 2 ) magnetic flux continually emerges through the photosphere in inter - granular lanes , with quiet sun field strengths up to several hundred gauss in internetwork , @xmath227 g in network , and with the emergence first appearing as a region of mixed polarity , nearly horizontal flux ( lites et al .",
    "1996 ; orozco surez et al . 2007 ;",
    "lites et al .",
    "2008 ; lites 2009 ) .",
    "the emerging magnetic structures become more vertical and quasi - cylindrical as they rise , similar to the geometry of type 2 spicules .",
    "( 3 ) on the orders of magnitude larger scales of emerging sunspots , pores , and active regions , @xmath107 emerges carrying currents generated below the photosphere ( leka et al . 1996 ; lites et al . 1998 ; burnette et al . 2004 ; sun et al .",
    "flaring phenomena in these regions include acceleration of plasma up to speeds @xmath297 times greater than those of type 2 spicules .",
    "the field emerges as mixed polarity , nearly horizontal flux ropes with bipolar geometries , and field strengths @xmath298 g. the topology becomes more complex as the field rises into the chromosphere .",
    "lites et al .",
    "( 1998 ) emphasize that sections of these flux ropes can attain kilo - gauss strength after they become nearly vertical as they flow out of the flux emergence region and rise into the chromosphere .",
    "this vertical , quasi - cylindrical geometry is similar to type 2 spicule geometry on smaller scales . by analogy ,",
    "the observations of flux emergence with plasma acceleration on these relatively larger , better resolved scales support the proposition that emerging non - potential inter - granular flux is a source of current systems that drive type 2 spicules . at present there",
    "do not appear to be any other type 2 spicule acceleration mechanisms that are as strongly supported by observations .",
    "the chromosphere is a highly resistive medium with respect to the pedersen current density @xmath299 ( @xmath300 in the chromosphere ) due to the combination of weak ionization and strong magnetization , which distinguishes the chromosphere from the weakly ionized , weakly magnetized photosphere , and the strongly ionized , strongly magnetized corona ( goodman 2000 , 2004 ) . here",
    "`` highly resistive '' means the pedersen resistivity @xmath301 is orders of magnitude larger than @xmath125 .",
    "this raises the following questions : ( 1 ) if emerging magnetic flux is considered as a driver of type 2 spicules , are the associated currents strong enough to cause type 2 spicule acceleration ? ( 2 ) if the answer is yes , is the @xmath126 associated with emerging flux sufficiently dissipated by pedersen current dissipation below the height at which spicules form so that the lorentz force can not be a major component of the force that accelerates type 2 spicules ?",
    "at present these questions can not be answered for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the formation heights of type 2 spicules are not known , other than that they form somewhere in the chromosphere . ( 2 ) an approximate , meaningful answer to these questions can be obtained from simulations of instances of the flux emergence process that include the essential physics , and use spatial and temporal resolutions sufficient to accurately compute @xmath126 , and the associated lorentz force and @xmath302 .",
    "such simulations do not yet exist .",
    "the 3d simulations of flux emergence by arber et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are a step towards developing such a simulation , and suggest that as flux rises into the chromosphere , there is strong dissipation of @xmath299 , consistent with general results in goodman ( 2000 , 2004 ) , and the expectation that the atmosphere becomes increasingly force free with increasing height .",
