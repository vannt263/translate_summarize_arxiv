    "impressive progress has been achieved within the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formulation of quantum transport using the simple ground - state density - functional exchange - correlation potential in a self - consistent formulation  @xcite ( negf - dft ) .",
    "however , limitations of the latter approximation were recently identified  @xcite . for instance , negf - dft s omission of the derivative - discontinuity in the exchange - correlation energy functional was found responsible for serious errors in transport calculation through localized resonant levels  @xcite .",
    "improvements through an ( spin- ) unrestricted negf - dft formulation have been argued to describe properly some aspects of the coulomb blockade in quantum junctions  @xcite . at this level of the theory the exchange - correlation potential of the equilibrium system , @xmath0 ,",

    "@xcite identified a dynamical correction to the resistance of a quantum junction stemming from the contribution of the exchange - correlation electric field to the overall drop in the total potential .",
    "they estimated the correction within time - dependent current - density functional theory  @xcite ( tdcdft ) and showed that it has its origin in the non - local density - dependence of the functional .",
    "the very applicability of time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) to the problem of quantum transport in the long - time limit has been discussed in depth by stefanucci and almbladh  @xcite and by di ventra and todorov  @xcite .",
    "several authors have proposed alternative treatments that avoid the complexities of the exchange - correlation kernels of td(c)dft , either by treating the central region with the configuration integration method  @xcite while approximating the non - equilibrium distribution of the electrons , or by using the usual negf - dft approach in combination with a model self - energy within the central region  @xcite .",
    "more systematic approach to the self - energy can be obtained through well tested approximations like the @xmath1 method  @xcite . due to the large computational demand",
    "so far only very small systems with restricted size of the basis set could be studied .",
    "however , the results are encouraging , e.g. the kondo effect phenomenology seems to be well described within the self - consistent @xmath1 method  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a systematic approach for addressing the conductance of a fully interacting system at the _ ab - initio _ level is not available .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the very formulation of the negf formalism  @xcite is based on the concept of noninteracting electrodes and demands partitioning of the system and the electron - electron interaction  @xcite .",
    "stefanucci and almbladh  @xcite showed that the partitioning can be avoided in principle but practical inclusion of the many - body interactions into the formalism seems to be extremely cumbersome .",
    "fortunately , partitioning is not necessary within the linear response formulation .",
    "several authors have addressed the conductance of interacting system of electrons within the framework of the kubo formalism arriving at a 2-point landauer - like formula for the conductance  @xcite by making certain assumptions about the steady - state total electric field .",
    "there is , however , a problem with this derivation since it ignores the charge redistribution in the conducting system when the steady state is forming .",
    "in fact , ignoring these aspects one quickly arrives at various unphysical corrections to the conductance  @xcite .",
    "the problem of charge redistributions has been first pointed out by thouless  @xcite .",
    "later kamenev and kohn  @xcite cast it into a self - consistent framework for many - terminal conductance .    in our work",
    "we further develop the formalism that treats the charge redistribution correctly , find its physical interpretation in terms of a time - dependent transient process that leads to the establishment of a current - carrying steady state , and derive a closed formula for the 4-point conductance that is well - defined formally as well as physically .    to describe quantum transport it is necessary to consider the production of a steady state with nonzero current in a generic quantum junction , starting from the ground state ( or more generally , from an equilibrium ensemble at finite temperature ) .",
    "physically , we expect to achieve a steady state that has a uniform average current @xmath2 flowing through the system , accompanied by a total potential exhibiting a drop @xmath3 across it .",
    "as was advocated many years ago by landauer  @xcite , @xmath3 arises from the resistivity dipole , a local charge imbalance of a piled - up charge in the front and depleted charge behind a quantum junction .",
    "physically such a state is reached by attaching a macroscopic battery to the circuit that pumps electrons from one electrode to the other until a certain potential difference between these two is established . for modeling purposes this mechanism can not be used directly  . here",
    "we will use a construct based on an auxiliary homogeneous vector potential @xmath4 , pointing in the direction of the eventual flow of current , giving a momentum transfer to all the electrons in the infinite system within a finite interval of time .",
    "( this auxiliary vector potential is similar in spirit to the one used by r. gebauer and r. car to model a nanojunction using periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "there , in contrast to our work , the vector potential grows linearly in time for all @xmath5 and the work exerted on the system must be dissipated via auxiliary phonons located in the electrodes . )",
    "the infinite extent of the system is formally essential to our treatment .",
    "it is necessary for a continuous spectrum and for giving a momentum transfer at @xmath6 to infinitely many electrons present in the system so that the current will flow for all times @xmath5 .",
    "however , we would like to mention already at this point that in practical calculations the necessity of the infinite extension can be relaxed so that the formulation can be used for practical _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "the response of the current density to a general external electric field is given within the linear response theory by  @xcite @xmath7 for simplicity we introduce a symbolic notation for the above equation in the form @xmath8 . in our work ,",
    "the role of the external field is taken by the auxiliary field @xmath9 that is homogeneous and has only a finite duration , i.e. it is absent for large times and it bears no information about the drop in potential in the long - time limit .",
    "the latter is contained within the _ induced _ field @xmath10 , which appears explicitly when considering the irreducible ( or proper ) conductivity  @xcite , @xmath11 the induced field accounts for the electron - electron interaction at the hartree level , which is usually referred to as the long - range effects of the coulomb interaction , whereas the rest of the interactions between electrons , the short range part , is included within the irreducible conductivity .",
    "the quantity in which we are primarily interested in is the conductance , defined as @xmath12 where @xmath3 is a voltage drop . for @xmath13 , the detailed spatial and time dependence of the current density and the induced field",
    "while the steady current is being established are of no relevance .",
    "we define the voltage drop as the overall drop in potential of the induced field @xmath14 along the current flow ( along the @xmath15 axis ) between far left and far right , @xmath16 which will be indicated by a superscript @xmath17 in the associated 4-point conductance , @xmath18 .",
    "this definition is most suitable    .",
    "measuring the voltage drop inside the simulation box ( supercell ) , where the current density is nonzero , gives the four - point conductance @xmath19 .",
    "increasing the supercell the two quantities approach each other ( see sec .",
    "[ sec-5]).,width=302 ]    for _ ab - initio _ modeling and does not suffer from ambiguities present when one considers two chemical potentials .",
    "in mesoscopic physics , the above definition of conductance is referred to as the 4-point conductance ( hence the superscript ) since it represents measurement of the voltage drop using contacts different from those acting as a source and drain of the current . in the extreme case of a 1d conducting channel of non - interacting , but locally neutral electrons it reduces to the well - known expression @xmath20 .",
    "this is in contrast with the most frequently encountered 2-point conductance , @xmath21 , where the voltage drop is understood to be the difference in electro - chemical potentials of the two macroscopic electrodes , @xmath22 ( see fig .  [ fig-0 ] ) .",
    "since the electrodes are not part of the quantum - mechanical model of the conducting channel , the familiar landauer result @xmath23 is believed not to be derivable from the kubo formalism  @xcite and its plausible derivations are always accompanied with steps motivated by physical insight and arguments about phase - incoherent adiabatically widening electrodes  @xcite .",
    "here we show that for a nanocontact between massive electrodes the 4-point conductance approaches the 2-point landauer formula .",
    "however we never make a reference to @xmath22 and we consistently work with the drop in the induced electrostatic potential only . our claims for its applicability for the experimental 2-point conductance follow from the fact that for massive electrodes connected with a nanojunction the current density in the electrodes goes to zero and thereby the drop in the induced ( hartree ) potential is an excellent indicator of the phenomenological quantity @xmath22 .",
    "the latter argument serves as a motivation to use the @xmath18 as conceptually and formally well defined quantity to characterize systems of fully interacting electrons in any geometry of the junction .",
    "an essential property of the conductivity response function of extended systems capable of coherent transport is their singular long range character for large times or  equivalently  as the frequency approaches zero  @xcite . to show this behavior explicitly we need to introduce a few geometrical details of the studied nanojunction which do not restrict the generality of our argument .",
    "we consider a geometry where @xmath15 is a direction of the current flow , @xmath24 a reciprocal vector in that direction , and for clarity we assume that the system can be put into a periodic supercell along the @xmath25 directions .",
    "the conductance @xmath18 is then a conductance for the area of the supercell @xmath26 . to find the current flowing through @xmath26",
    ", we integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq-2 ] ) across the cross - sectional area .",

    "the eq .  ( [ eq-5 ] ) can now be analyzed in the light of the above observations .",
    "first , let us consider a distant part of one of the electrodes , @xmath38 , for times such that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fermi energy and fermi speed respectively . in this regime ,",
    "the response in the electrodes ( @xmath42 ) is determined by the electrode itself , independently of the nanojunction .",
    "after a short relaxation time ( @xmath43 ) the auxiliary field establishes a uniform ( i.e. @xmath15-independent ) current inside the electrode @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the irreducible conductivity of the electrode only .",
    "generalization for an electrode with atomic structure is straightforward : the induced field @xmath14 is split into the local field induced inside the electrode , @xmath46 ( which has an average value zero over the electrode s unit cell ) , and the difference @xmath47 .",

    "[ eq-3 ] and the former needs to be included into the response entering the functional @xmath48 $ ] where @xmath49 with @xmath50 . ] while preserving the local charge neutrality within the electrode .",
    "we are free to choose any time - dependence of the field as long as it delivers finite change of momentum for each electron and thus establishes the eventual steady current ; the most convenient choice is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the magnitude of the change in the homogeneous vector potential at @xmath6 .",
    "this picture is not valid as one approaches the region of the nanojunction , i.e. for @xmath53 .",
    "still , since the current will keep coming from the left electrode and disappearing into the right electrode ( there is always such @xmath54 that for any time @xmath55 we have @xmath56 and hence the above analysis can be applied ) , the charge will have to pile up in front of the junction and similarly deplete behind the junction , creating a resistivity dipole  @xcite .",
    "the incoming current can not be decreased by some form of reflected front / disturbance from the junction since this would break the local charge neutrality within the electrode , leading to strong opposing fields .",
    "hence the dipole around the junction and therefore the drop in the induced potential @xmath3 will grow , increasing the current in the junction region until it becomes equal to the current , @xmath2 , deep inside the electrode , as described in the preceding paragraph .",

    "this implies that the local charge neutrality is not enforced ( since only the irreducible response enters @xmath65 ) and as a result most of the electrons coming from one electrode will be reflected from the nanojunction and decrease the current .",

    "this formally justifies landauer s arguments in favor of the expression @xmath80 as the conductance of a nanojunction between two phase - randomizing and adiabatically widening reservoirs . as we can clearly see , it is only the widening that is really needed to have the conductance of the junction as a whole be given by eq .",

    "some doubt about the applicability of the latter might arise from the dynamics deep in the electrode described in section  [ sec-4 ] .",
    "there , the induced current is dominated by a divergenceless component that can not be related to a time - dependent density , which is the only physically relevant quantity within the tddft . however , at the level of fermi - liquid theory , this divergenceless current is identical to that of a non - interacting system due to the backflow of quasiparticles  @xcite .",
