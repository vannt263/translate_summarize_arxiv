    "this transport mechanism , known as quantum pumping , is intimately related to the properties of the instantaneous eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the system hamiltonian .",
    "pumping is adiabatic if the variation of the parameters is slow as compared to the characteristic time scales of the system .",
    "since the pioneering work of thouless in 1983  @xcite pumping has been attracting an intense theoretical interest  @xcite and experimental interest  @xcite . in the scattering approach to quantum transport  @xcite ,",
    "the pumped charge in an adiabatic cycle can be expressed in terms of an integral in parameter space which does not depend on the evolution period @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , adiabatic quantum pumping appears to possess an intrinsic geometric character which allows us to relate it with the berry phase accumulated by the system wave function during the cyclic evolution  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , under proper conditions , the quantum pumping can acquire also a topological nature which yields to a quantization of the pumped charge / spin per cycle .",
    "this effect is connected to the appearance , in the hamiltonian spectrum , of gapless points enclosed by the adiabatic loop in parameter space  @xcite .",
    "conditions for the quantization of the pumped charge have been discussed in ref .  , while , for the case of spin transport , a classification of topological non - interacting pumps has been given in ref .  .",
    "the study of quantum pumping has been extended also to interacting systems  @xcite . here",
    "the hamiltonian gapless points responsible for topological pumping stem from many - body effects and are typically associated to quantum phase transitions .",
    "this suggests that quantized adiabatic transport can be achieved by evolving the system around a loop in parameter space enclosing a critical point .",
    "recently it has been suggested , with the support of an analysis based on bosonization , that quantized pumping occurs in systems of interacting lattice bosons at integer filling in one dimension  @xcite . when both on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions are taken into account ,",

    "we tackle this problem by means of numerical time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "we compute the number of pumped particles per cycle as a function of the system size and show that the scaling is consistent with unit quantized pumping when the adiabatic loop encloses the critical point , while it otherwise vanishes .",
    "we show that the evolution period @xmath1 does not affect the pumping properties of the system , provided it is chosen so that the system remains adiabatic with respect to the minimum instantaneous gap .",
    "the topological character of the pumping mechanism is tested by considering different loops and assessing the independence of the number of pumped particles on the specific trajectory in parameter space .",
    "a quantitative analysis of finite - size and non - adiabatic effects is a necessary and important step towards a possible experimental observation of topological pumps .",
    "pumping in the bose - hubbard model can be analyzed in two different configurations .",

    ", we will provide results about the simulation of a pure interacting system in an open - ended geometry , showing that the ultimate effect of the pumping mechanism after one loop is to drag particles from one edge to the opposite edge of the chain , leaving the bulk unaffected .",

    "we define the model and summarize the salient features of its phase diagram which are of relevance for the topological pumping .",

    "there is a direct superfluid ( sf ) to mott - insulator ( mi ) transition . for sufficiently large values of @xmath13 , before entering a density - wave ( dw ) phase characterized by a non - uniform boson density with staggered ordering  @xcite , the model defined by eq .",

    "( [ eq : fullh ] ) ( such as the energy and the relevant correlation functions ) , we impose a mps trial wave function , and perform a variational minimization of the energy cost function site by site .",
    "subsequently , in order to follow the evolution of the vector in eq .",
    "( [ neweq111 ] ) , we adopt the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) procedure  @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we were able to keep track of the globally conserved number of bosons , thus always working in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we fixed the number of particles in order to have unit filling ( @xmath49 ) , and distributed them over lattices of up to @xmath50 sites  @xcite .",
    "the choice of the boundary conditions of the chain requires a special attention : as a matter of fact , most of the time - dependent simulations presented in this paper ( except those in sec .",
    "[ sec : obc ] ) have been carried out for a ring geometry , _ i.e. _ , under pbc .",
    "it turns out that the standard t - dmrg algorithm is not optimized for these boundary configurations .",
    "indeed , on one hand this choice imposes a cyclic structure to the mps ansatz  @xcite , thus resulting in a considerable slowdown of the static optimization algorithm , unless some clever strategies are adopted  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inability to construct an orthonormal basis , starting from the leftmost and from the rightmost mps sites and requiring the proper unitary conditions on the defining matrices , prevents from the possibility to write any bipartition of the system in two contiguous blocks of sites as a schmidt decomposition .",
    "this causes a failure in the standard tebd scheme and leads to an uncontrollable truncation error , which demands for a substantial increase of the required mps bond - link dimension @xmath51 and a drastic slowdown of the computational performances .     sites . ]    instead of directly imposing pbc , we found it more convenient to implement a standard t - dmrg scheme with obc , where the 1d physical system with a ring geometry has been `` flattened '' as a narrow string and therefore mapped into an open ended chain . as pictorially shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg_pbc ] , we associate to each computational site two distant physical sites .",
    "this trick enables us to use a conventional t - dmrg code for open boundaries and to take advantage of all the above mentioned methods for standard obc .",
    "in particular we are able to easily implement the conservation of abelian symmetries and to control the truncation error within the tebd scheme .",
    "the price we have to pay is that of doubling the local hilbert space of each computational site , and using a larger @xmath51 value in order to get accuracies comparable to the obc situation  @xcite .",
    "our code dynamically updates the bond - link dimension used at each link , both in the static algorithm and during a single step of time evolution , according to a given threshold value in the sum of the discarded weights @xmath52 .",
    "we found that , in order to keep it below @xmath53 , a number of states @xmath54 is generally sufficient  @xcite .",
    "we checked that a further reduction of @xmath52 does not significantly affect our results .",
    "in the tebd dynamics , we employed a fourth - order trotter expansion of the time - evolution operator , thus minimizing the error due to a finite time step ( but still admitting time steps of the order @xmath55 ) .",
    "as we are dealing with finite - size systems characterized by the hamiltonian in eq .  , the behavior of the ground - state energy gap is important , especially at the critical point and along the loop in parameter space . in order to enter the adiabatic regime ,",
    "ideally one would like to complete the loop in a time @xmath1 which is much larger than the inverse of @xmath56 that is the smallest of the gaps @xmath57 of the hamiltonians @xmath58 $ ] evaluated along the selected loop  @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , for a finite - size system , the gap @xmath59 of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : fullh ] ) at the critical point @xmath60 is never exactly zero .",
    "therefore , on decreasing the amplitude of the loop enclosing the singularity , one should start to observe deviations from the quantized value for the smallest loops for which the finiteness of the critical gap starts to be resolved .",
    "an additional constraint on the amplitude of the pumping path raises due to the emergence of the dw phase close to the haldane insulator .",
    "all these requirements lead us to consider the loops shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] , where we depict four paths in the @xmath40 parameter space along which we have computed the evolution governed by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath61 $ ] with period @xmath1 : @xmath62 .",
    "three of them ( black , red , and green set ) encircle the critical point @xmath28 , while the last one ( blue set ) is trivial , meaning that the gap is never vanishing inside it .",
    "the asymmetric shape of the loops with respect to the critical point is a trade off between the need to avoid the influence of the nearby dw phase , and at the same time to have a contour sufficiently far from the critical point in order to minimize the effects of the finiteness of the critical gap @xmath59 .    in order to define the time scales on a more quantitative basis , in the following we are going to analyze the scaling of the gaps @xmath59 and @xmath57 as a function of the system size @xmath2 .",
    "to do so , we focus on the ground - state charge gap , that is the difference in the energy needed to add ( @xmath63 ) or to remove ( @xmath64 ) a single boson in the system : @xmath65 . in the whole mi , as well as in the hi phase far from the transition with the dw phase  @xcite , the lowest energy excitations of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : fullh ] ) are indeed charge excitations , therefore the values of @xmath66 ( evaluated for the proper @xmath14 and @xmath38 values ) can be used to derive @xmath59 and @xmath57 .     at @xmath67 ,",
    "close to the critical point and for @xmath20 . at the phase transition , @xmath68",
    ", the gap scales to zero as @xmath69 ( see the inset , where we plot the minimum reached value @xmath59 as a function of @xmath2the dashed line indicates a behavior @xmath70 and is plotted as a guide to the eye ) .",
    "away from criticality , the gap is almost independent on the length , as long as @xmath71 .",
    "as detailed in text , the values of @xmath72 and @xmath59 reported here have been computed by evaluating the charge gap @xmath66 of the system . ]",
    "let us first discuss the gap close to the critical point , @xmath59 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : critgap ] we plot the size dependence of the charge gap , and show that , in the thermodynamic limit , it vanishes as @xmath73 . for our convenience",
    "we computed the gaps in a chain with obc .",
    "the differences are not relevant for our purposes ( _ i.e. _ , to determine the relevant time - scales for the pumping period ) . on the other hand in this way we could easily analyze the critical gap for chains up to few hundred sites  @xcite .",
    "now the interesting point which permits us to address the regime of topological pumping is that , already for @xmath74 , the gap @xmath59 turns out to be almost one order of magnitude smaller than the typical gap @xmath57 encountered along the loops @xmath33 of fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] . a quantitative analysis of the value of the gap along one particular loop is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopgap ] , where we took data directly in the case with pbc ( specifically , here we analyzed _ `` loop  1 '' _ ) . in accordance with the fact that along the loop the system remains distant from criticality , the gap barely depends on the size .",
    "we notice that the value of @xmath57 is not uniform along the loop and can significantly diminish at some points .",
    "this imposes strict conditions on the evolution period @xmath1 necessary to observe quantized pumping and calls for a careful analysis of the role of non - adiabatic corrections .",
    "along _ `` loop  1 '' _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : loops ] ) for three different system sizes , @xmath75 [ as in fig .",
    "[ fig : critgap ] , the values of @xmath57 have been obtained by computing the charge gap @xmath76 .",
    "the minimum value of the gap @xmath77 ( indicated by an arrow in the figure ) is the bottleneck to define the adiabatic dynamics . ]      roughly speaking , one could expect that the adiabatic regime is achieved for periods @xmath78 . a good estimator of the quality of the adiabatic approximation along the performed loop is given by the excess energy @xmath79 .",
    "this is quantified by the difference between the energy of the wavefunction during the evolution , @xmath80 , and the energy @xmath81 corresponding to the instantaneous ground state @xmath82 of @xmath83 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_t ] we analyzed the value @xmath85 at the end of the loop , as a function of the total evolution time @xmath1 .",
    "the excess energy is generally decreasing with @xmath1 , thus meaning that the adiabaticity condition along the loop can be progressively approached by slowing down the variation of the system parameters @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , we note that @xmath85 is not strongly affected by the system size @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the instantaneous gap barely depends on @xmath2 , provided this is sufficiently large ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : loopgap ] ) .",
    "we finally point out that , far from the adiabaticity condition , such energy is not guaranteed to be monotonic in @xmath1 .",

    "let us now introduce the quantity of interest , the pumped charge , to be evaluated by means of direct tebd numerical approach for the time evolution of 1d many - body systems .",

    "as we will show below , it turns out that the pumping mechanism tends to deplete the particle density on one side , and to increase it on the opposite one .",

    "]        finally we note that , once the adiabatic condition along the loop is satisfied , the total pumped charge does not depend on the initial point along the loop , as explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_pos ] .",
    "we conclude this section by observing that the plateaus emerging in the time - resolved pumped charge are adiabatic , but of a non topological nature , and depend on the fine details of the instantaneous low - lying energy spectrum .",
    "they can change according to the specific shape of the loop around the critical point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_t ] ) , as well as on the initial condition along the loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_pos ] ) .",
    "quantum pumping can also be studied in an open - ended chain . in this case , differently from the ring geometry , the system no longer exhibits translational invariance and all the quantities defined in sec  [ sec : pump ] become site - dependent . in sec .  [",
    "sec : obc_results ] we display numerical evidence of the fact that this configuration leads to a pumping mechanism which , after one loop , produces the transport of a quantized bosonic charge from one end to the opposite end of the chain .",
    "we remark that , in order to guarantee unit filling everywhere in the chain [ modelled by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullh ] ) ] during the whole cycle , it would be necessary to couple the system to two ( non - interacting ) reservoirs attached at the two ends . in the absence of any direct bias between the electrodes , the charge would be transferred by a uniform modulation of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath14 in the middle ( interacting ) part of the system , along the loops like those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] . on the other hand , in order to prevent a depletion of particles in the interacting region in favor of the non - interacting leads , it would be necessary to consider a regime of weak system - reservoir coupling , thus finding a trade - off between depletion and relaxation of pumped particles into the leads . for interacting bosonic systems , this regime is actually very difficult to achieve , not only in simulations , but even conceptually .",
    "for this reason , and owing to the fact that experimentally it would be much easier to realize an open - ended chain , we have focused on a system with obc .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_obc ] , one immediately recognizes that , during the time evolution ruled by the adiabatic variation of the parameters @xmath131 along a closed loop ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : loops ] ) , the average on - site density changes with time .",
    "in particular , following _ `` loop  1 '' _ in the anti - clockwise direction , we are able to progressively detect a net imbalance of bosonic particles from the right end , where we observe a depletion from the average unit filling , to the left end , where a bump in the density profile eventually appears . in order to probe the quantization of particle transport ,",
    "one then has to investigate the charge @xmath132 pumped along one cycle , according to eq .  .",
    "before discussing our results , it is important to stress that , for obc , the charge transport from one edge to the opposite edge of the chain unavoidably drives the system out of equilibrium , so that , for any @xmath133 , the many - body wavefunction @xmath134 can not be in the instantaneous ground state ( ultimately this is due to the fact that , when passing through the hi phase , the system faces a four - fold degenerate ground - state ) .",
    "this contrasts with the translationally invariant pbc setup , where the adiabatic approximation can be satisfied for sufficiently slow time variations of the hamiltonian parameters ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : gaps ] ) , and is associated to the geometric nature of the pumping mechanism .",
    "interestingly enough however , despite adiabaticity can not be fulfilled as a global condition , it can be still satisfied `` locally '' .",
    "more precisely , this means that , even though the global state of the bosons might depart from the corresponding instantaneous ground - state of the driving hamiltonian , the reduced density matrix associated with a specific collection of sites remains sufficiently close to its adiabatic counterpart .",
    "clearly , any deviation of the density profiles from unit filling indicates the loss of local adiabaticity .",
    "therefore , in order to satisfy such condition , the instantaneous current @xmath135 has to be computed in the bulk of the system , where the particle density is still commensurate and the depletion / accumulation mechanism has not spoiled the insulating properties of the bosonic system .",
    "this requirement forces one to consider quite large sizes , since the region of deviation from the unit filling is proportional to the period @xmath1 and involves a non negligible part of the whole system , in all the simulatable cases .",

    ", we also computed the total number of particles on the left and on the right of the insulating region , finding that deviations from half filling correspond , at the end of the cycle , to having respectively one particle more and one particle less .",

    "adiabatic pumping in interacting systems is still a rather unexplored field , especially in the case of bosonic particles .",
