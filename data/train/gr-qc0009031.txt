    "the large scale homogeneity of the universe has been recently questioned in an increasing number of works .",
    "for instance , the controversy over whether the universe is smooth on large scale or presents an unbounded fractal hierarchy is not yet ended , and its final resolution requires the next generation of galaxy catalogs ( martinez , 1999 ) . from another point of view ,",
    "a direct test of the cosmological principle on our past light cone , up to redshifts approaching unity , has been recently proposed , using type ia supernovae as standard candles ( clrier , 2000 ) .",
    "if such tests were to exclude the universe homogeneity assumption up to such large scales , and even beyond , we would need alternative inhomogeneous models to describe its evolution . +",
    "this article is the third in a series dedicated to the study of a new cosmological application of the inhomogeneous lematre - tolman - bondi ( lematre , 1933 ; tolman , 1934 ; bondi , 1947 ) spherically symmetrical dust models . + in a first work ( clrier & schneider , 1998 , hereafter refered to as cs ) ,",
    "a subclass of these models which solves the standard horizon problem without need for any inflationary phase has been identified .",
    "this subclass exhibits spatial flatness and a conic big - bang singularity of `` delayed '' type . in this preliminary approach ,",
    "the observer has been assumed located sufficiently near the symmetry center of the model as to justify the `` centered earth '' approximation .",
    "the horizon problem has thus been solved using the properties of the null - geodesics issued from the last - scattering surface and propagating in a matter dominated region of the universe , as seen from a centered observer .",
    "+ however , we stressed in cs a potential difficulty , namely the observer at the center .",
    "although such a location is not forbidden by scientific principles , it does not account for the observed large scale temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "+ the dipole moment in the cmbr anisotropy is usually considered to result from a doppler effect produced by our motion with respect to the cmbr rest - frame ( partridge,1988 ) . in the second work of the series ( schneider & clrier , 1999 , hereafter refered to as sc ) , we assumed that the measured cmbr dipole and quadrupole moments can have , totally or partially , a cosmological origin , and we studied to which extent they can be reproduced , in a peculiar example of our delayed big - bang ( dbb ) class of models , with no _ a priori _ assumption of the observer s location .",
    "we have shown that this implies a relation between this location and the model parameter value , namely the increasing rate @xmath0 of the big - bang function .",
    "the farther the observer is from the symmetry center , the smaller is the value of @xmath0 .",
    "+ the purpose of this present work is therefore to prove that the geometry of the dbb model is such that the horizon problem can be solved , in principle , with no _ a priori _ constraint on the location of the observer . by `` in principle '' , we mean : provided the null - geodesics are not too distorted in the radiation dominated area , such as to prevent them from reconnecting before the big - bang surface .",
    "were this not the case , it would yield a constraint on the model parameters , as discussed in cs .",
    "this allows us to generalize the previous results of cs to a model with an off - center observer , thus improving the consistency of the assumption of a possible cosmological origin of the large scale features of the cmbr temperature anisotropies .",
    "+ the above property will have however to be interpreted with care , as regards the ehlers - geren - sachs ( 1968 ) and almost ehlers - geren - sachs ( stoegger et al .",
    "1995 ) theorems , which are usually considered as robust supports for the cosmological principle . as was stressed in the preceding works , this principle is not mandatory and does not apply to the dbb model .",

    "the region between the big - bang surface @xmath12 and the shell - crossing one is thus excluded from the part of the model retained to describe the matter dominated region of the universe , which we discuss here . + the optical depth of the universe to thomson scattering is approximated by a step function ( see sc ) .",

    "+    the light - like character of the shell - crossing surface forces all matter to be causally connected at @xmath56 , and any finite region to have been in causal contact at some @xmath57 .",
    "+ the horizon problem is thus solved permanently in this model , _ a priori _ , for any location of the observer .",
    "+ it is worth emphasizing that if the inflationary assumption also solves the horizon problem , it does so only temporarily . in effect , if one considers the horizon problem in a standard flrw universe , as sketched in fig.4 , the big - bang surface is space - like .",
    "it thus implies the existence of a limiting point @xmath58 , in the history of the observer @xmath24 , beyond which the observer sees , on the last - scattering surface , some no causally connected points .",

    "@xmath58 is thus the limiting time beyond which the observer @xmath24 experiences the horizon problem .",
    "the solution proposed by the inflationary assumption is presented in fig.5 .",
    "adding an inflationary phase in the early history of the universe amounts to adding a slice of de sitter space - time betwen the big - bang and the last - scattering , thus postponing the limit @xmath58 when the observer can see non - causally connected points in the cmbr .",

    "@xmath58 is thus postponed , allowing the current observer @xmath24 to see a causally connected cmbr .",
    "when time elapses and the observer reaches the above @xmath58 region , the horizon problem returns .",
    "in cs we identified a subclass of the ltb models with a big - bang of `` delayed '' type which solves the standard horizon problem without need for any inflationary phase . in this preliminary approach ,",
    "the observer was assumed located sufficiently near the symmetry center of the model as to justify the `` centered earth '' approximation . + here ,",
    "we report a further analysis of the properties of the dbb model to show that this model solves the horizon problem even with an off - center observer . the model is thus relieved of a prescription that could be considered as `` unnatural '' .",
    "+ the model is also provided with a new free parameter , the spatial location @xmath59 of the earth in the universe , which accounts for the large scale inhomogeneities observed in the cmbr temperature anisotropies .",
    "the measured dipole and quadrupole moments of these anisotropies set bounds on the correlated values of this @xmath59 parameter and of the local deviation of the model from homogeneity , accounted for by the slope of the big - bang function . a possible cosmological part of these large scale features seen in the cmbr , if once observationally identified , would select an even narrower curve in the parameter space of the model , as shown in sc .",
    "+ it is of the utmost importance to stress that , as was the case with a centered observer , these results hold for any universe arbitrarily _ locally _ close to the flrw @xmath60 asymptotic model .",
    "the only requirements to be fulfilled are conditions ( [ eq:3 ] ) which are obviously compatible with an almost `` flatness '' of the big - bang function up to comoving shells arbitrarily far out the @xmath59 shell where the observer is located .",
    "the properties of the light - cones are preserved as long as this function does not reduce to a mere constant .",
    "for instance , the subclass retained in sc , with @xmath61 , reduces to a flrw model for @xmath0 equal to zero , but fulfills the conditions ( [ eq:3 ] ) for @xmath0 as small as one wishes , provided @xmath0 does not vanish",
    ". no bound can therefore be _ a priori _ inferred on the observer location , as , according to sc , an arbitrarily small value of @xmath0 corresponds to an arbitrarily large value of @xmath59 , and conversely .",
    "+ a point worth discussing here is the validity of this claim as regards the almost ehlers - geren - sachs ( aegs ) theorem ( stoegger et al .",
    "this theorem states that `` if all fundamental observers measure the cosmic background radiation to be almost isotropic in an expanding universe region , then that univere is locally almost spatially homogeneous and isotropic in that region . ''",
    "the u region considered by the aegs authors is `` the region within and near our past light cone from decoupling to the present day '' .",
    "it is easy to see that small @xmath0 dbb models fulfills the aegs prescription , as they can remain `` close '' to flrw models for shells located between the center and an arbitrarily large value of the comoving radial coordinate , including the aegs region .",
    "but the further away part of these small @xmath0 dbb models infinitely diverges from homogeneity . on the contrary",
    ", the aegs theorem does not apply to large @xmath0 dbb models , implying an observer close to the center .",
    "the founding assumption of this theorem , namely the local copernican principle applied to the u region , is not retained in this case . as was discussed in cs ,",
    "such a choice is perfectly compatible with all available observational data and scientifically grounded principles .",
    "+ it is also interesting to note that , contrary to the inflationary assumption which restores causality between the different points seen in the cmbr , but only temporarily , the dbb model provides a permanent solution to the horizon problem , whatever the position of the observer on his world line .",
    "+ in the prospect of future observational tests of the large scale ( in)homogeneity of the universe , the development of other interesting inhomogeneous models must be regarded as an important issue . however",
    ", this presented result is only a first improvement in the release of the simplifying assumptions ( retained in cs ) for a preliminary study of the properties induced by a `` delayed big - bang '' .",
    "other analyses are still needed , among which the release of the spatial spherical symmetry of the model and of the dust approximation should be considered as priorities .",
    "+ _ aknowledgements . _",
