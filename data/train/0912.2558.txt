    "undergraduate students in science face a fascinating and challenging future , particularly in physics .",
    "scientists have proposed very interesting theories , which describe fairly well the microscopic world as well the macroscopic one , trying to match the quantum regime with cosmological scales ; the complexity which governs the biological phenomena has been the following target addressed by scientists , led by the productive studies on the matter behaviour . more and",
    "more accurate experiments have been planned and are now going to test the bases of the physics paradigms , such as the large hadronic collider ( lhc ) , which is going to shed light on the physics of the standard model of particles and its extensions , the planck - herschel satellites , which target a very precise measurement of the properties of our universe , and the free electron lasers facilities , which produce high - brilliance , ultrafast x - ray pulses , thus allowing to investigate the fundamental processes of solid state physics , chemistry , and biology .",
    "these projects are the result of intense collaborations spread across the world , involving people belonging to different and complementary fields : physicists , chemists , biologists and other scientists , keen to make the best of these extraordinary laboratories .    in this context ,",
    "in which each branch of science becomes more and more focused on the details , it is very important to keep an eye on the global picture , being aware of the possible interconnections between inherent fields .",
    "this is even more crucial for students , who are approaching the research .    with this in mind , ph .",
    "d. students and young post - docs connected to the roman area have felt the need for an event able to establish the background and the network , necessary for interactions and collaborations .",
    "this resulted in the 1@xmath0 roman young researchers meeting  , a one day conference aimed primarily at graduate students and post - docs , working in physics . in its first edition , the meeting has been held at the university of roma `` tor vergata '' , and organised in three sections dedicated to up - to - date topics spanning broad research fields : astrophysics - cosmology , soft - condensed matter physics and theoretical - particle physics .",
    "our journey through the realm of physics started with the astrophysics and cosmology session , which opened the meeting with the description of two experiments , cochise and pilot , the former dedicated to the measurements of the sz signal on the cosmic microwave background radiation , the latter focused on the polarised light emitted from interstellar dust .",
    "a very important study in cosmology is related to the high redshift universe , and the amount of information we can extract from quasars and galaxy formation : this has been discussed from the point of view of the power spectra we measure from distant quasars and the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "the universe displays a variety of objects , which are very interesting _ per se _ , in addition to the useful information they bring on cosmogony , and represent indeed a genuine laboratory where we can observe processes at very high energy , unachievable elsewhere .",
    "an overview of the properties of blazars detected by the agile experiment , the bl lacs and the active galactic nuclei observed by swift and xmm has been presented .",
    "the second session covered an extremely rich and vast topic , condensed matter , whose research is fed and propulsed also by its applications to different fields .",
    "an example has been discussed focusing on the study of surgical infections , and how this process is modelled and simulated in order to guarantee the safety of the patient .",
    "two other challenging topics have been addressed , in particular the simulations of gels and nanocrystals and the application of spectroscopical tools to the study of nanomaterials .",
    "the last session shed light on theoretical and particle physics , starting from a description of a section of the atlas experiment built at lhc , followed by an overview of a possible anomaly - free supersymmetric extension of the standard model of particles and its signature at the lhc .",
    "the last talk discussed one of the most outstanding problem in cosmology , the so - called _ cosmological constant _",
    "one , from a new interesting prospective which finds its root in the neutrino flavour mixing mechanism .",
    "the 1@xmath0 roman young researchers meeting has been a great success mainly thanks to the high quality of the scientists who participated and gave rise to interesting discussions , stimulated by excellent presentations . encouraged by this result",
    ", the next appointment has already been set : the 2@xmath1 young researchers meeting in rome will take place in february 2010 at the university `` la sapienza '' in roma .",
    "further details will appear soon on the website of the meeting , where the presentations of the talks and more detailed information are already available .",
    "the contributions of each speaker who attended the meeting follow , organised in sessions which resemble the schedule of the meeting .",
