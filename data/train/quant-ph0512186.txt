    "helium 3 atoms in their ground state possess a purely nuclear spin @xmath1 .",

    "longitudinal coherence times @xmath2 of several days are measured in room temperature samples @xcite .",
    "the transverse coherence time @xmath3 , which would be as long as @xmath2 in zero magnetic field , is usually limited by magnetic field inhomogeneity if no special precaution is taken .",
    "transverse coherence times of several hours are observed in a very low field @xcite .",
    "these very long coherence times originate from the weakness of magnetic coupling on the one hand , and from the absence of electrical coupling on the other hand , as there is no electric quadrupole coupling within the ground state for spins 1/2 .",
    "it is tempting to exploit such long - lived coherence for quantum information purposes . in a previous letter",
    "@xcite we studied the possibility to transfer the squeezing of a cavity mode to @xmath0he nuclear spins .",
    "we showed that the squeezeing could be stored and retrieved from the atoms , thus realizing a quantum memory @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we presented in our letter a simplified model involving only two sublevels in the metastable state and gave numerical results for the more complicated case of @xmath0he . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on @xmath0he and treat in detail this more realistic case .",
    "section [ sec : exchange ] is devoted to metastability exchange collisions .",
    "we derive linearized heisenberg - langevin equations describing the exchange collisions from the standpoint of quantum fluctuations . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the model for squeezing transfer from a squeezed vacuum mode of the electromagnetic field to the atoms .",

    "section [ sec : lecture ] is devoted to the readout scheme of the quantum memory . in section [ sec:2cells ] , as a straightforward application of our scheme , we consider the possibility of creating long - lived quantum correlations between two macroscopic spins , in the move of the successful experiment in copenhagen @xcite , in which two macroscopic spins were entangled for @xmath4 ms , but on a completely different timescale .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : pdiff1 ] , we use a toy model to explore the consequences of an imperfect polarization of the atoms on our squeezing transfer scheme .",
    "over forty years ago , colegrove , schearer and walters @xcite demonstrated a technique to polarize @xmath0he relying on @xmath5 an optical interaction on an infrared transition from the metastable @xmath6s triplet state to the @xmath6p triplet state , and @xmath7 _ metastability exchange collisions _ between atoms in the ground state and in the metastable state .",
    "during such a collision , two atoms exchange their electronic degrees of freedom so that the metastable atom , oriented by optical pumping and with a nuclear polarization due to hyperfine coupling in the metastable state , becomes a polarized ground state atom @xcite .",
    "this technique called _ metastability exchange optical pumping _ is currently used to prepare polarized samples for nuclear physics experiments as well as in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging applications @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we suggest that metastability exchange collisions can also be used to transfer quantum correlations to the ground state nuclear spin of @xmath0he .",

    "the calculation of @xmath31 is performed by expressing @xmath21 in the decoupled spin basis of the nuclear spin @xmath32 and the total electronic spin @xmath33 in the metastable state , followed by a projection onto the hyperfine states ( eigenstates of the total momentum operator @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) which we name from @xmath36 to @xmath37 as in figure [ fig : schemamec ] .",

    "otherwise , the non - hamiltonian character of the exchange terms leads to a violation of the heisenberg uncertainty relations .",

    "in order to have a better physical insight it is possible to find simple analytical results within some reasonable approximation . by adiabatic elimination of the polarization @xmath157 and the cavity field assuming @xmath158 , one obtains @xmath159 in deriving ( [ eq : adiabs43 ] ) we assumed a raman configuration @xmath160 , @xmath161 and that the cavity detuning exactly compensates the cavity field dephasing due to the atoms : @xmath162 . from equation ( [ eq : adiabs43 ] )",

    "physically , if a significant dephasing between the squeezed field and the ground state coherence builds up during the squeezing transfer time , the atoms will see an average between the squeezed and the anti - squeezed quadrature of the field noise .",

    "[ fig : bhomo ] we calculated the variance of the ground state spin as a function of @xmath133 for an increasing inhomogeneity @xmath193 from zero ( thick line ) to @xmath194 . in practice a homogeneity of 100 ppm should be sufficient for the chosen parameters to guarantee that all atoms will be squeezed .",
    "as briefly stressed in @xcite the squeezed fluctuations which are stored into the nuclear spins can be retrieved optically in the field exiting the cavity by using the reverse transfer process .",
    "indeed , once the write sequence of the quantum memory has been completed , both the fields and the discharge can be switched off , leaving the atoms in the fundamental state in a spin - squeezed state . after a variable storage time , switching back on the discharge and only the control field in the same configuration as for the writing phase ( @xmath195 ) , will rapidly put a small fraction of atoms in the metastable state and start the reverse transfer process from the fundamental atoms to the field .",
    "the correlations in the ground state will slowly transfer via the metastable state to the intracavity field .",
    "this will then result in squeezed fluctuations for the field exiting the cavity , which can be measured by homodyne detection .",
    "more quantitatively , if we still assume that the metastable spin observables and the intra - cavity field adiabatically follow the ground state spin observables and the evolution equations for the fluctuations of the squeezed component are in the resonant situation , we have @xmath196 with @xmath197 + \\frac{f_{09}-f_{90}}{2i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] denoting by @xmath198 the start of the readout sequence and by @xmath199 the initial squeezing of the ground state nuclear spin , the two - time correlation function of the outgoing field amplitude quadrature can be obtained via ( [ eq : xoutt ] ) after integration of ( [ eq : iyt ] ) @xmath200e^{-\\gamma_f(t+t')}\\label{eq : correl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath89-correlated term corresponds to the vacuum fluctuations contribution , whereas the second term corresponds to a transient squeezing for the outgoing field which is proportional to the initial atomic squeezing . in ( [ eq : correl ] ) , @xmath179 designates the optimal quantum transfer efficiency in the ground state @xmath201 the ground state squeezing can be adequately measured by homodyne detection using a temporally matched local oscillator as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . using a local oscillator with envelope",
    "@xmath202 the normalized power measured by a fourier - limited spectrum analyzer integrating over a time @xmath203 is given by @xmath204 in order to measure the atomic squeezing one has to maximize the temporal overlap between the local oscillator and the field radiated by the atoms : @xmath205 .",
    "for such a local oscillator and for an integration time longer than the readout time @xmath206 the measured power can be written as the sum of a shot - noise term @xmath207 and a time - dependent signal term @xmath208 proportional to the initial squeezing : @xmath209e^{-2\\gamma_ft}\\ ] ] with @xmath210 .",
    "the ground state nuclear spin fluctuations can therefore be measured optically with the same efficiency @xmath179 as in the write sequence . however , because of the slow character of the correlation transfer process in the ground state the readout time is as long as the write time . as expected",
    "it is not possible to access the quantum memory faster during the readout than during the write phase .",
    "one could think of a faster readout method by transferring the fundamental atoms fluctuations to the metastable atoms and perform the optical readout in the regime @xmath211 .",
    "however , as we showed in section [ sec : exchange ] , starting with a squeezed fundamental spin and first switching on the discharge ( without the fields ) will transfer very few correlations from the fundamental to the metastable atoms and almost no squeezing will be retrieved in the field .",
    "a direct and important extension of the previous results is that it is possible to transfer quantum correlations between different light beams to two spatially separated nuclear spins .",
