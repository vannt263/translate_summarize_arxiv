    "mannheim @xcite ( henceforth m6 ) has developed a cosmological model ( mm ) based on conformal invariance .",
    "this model has a number of attractive features , but has not so far been accepted as a viable candidate for the correct theory of gravitation , in large part because it predicts , apparently unambiguously , a negative value for the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 . from this",
    "follows a thermal history markedly different from the usual one , and consequent difficulties in addressing questions such as primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we point out a mathematical problem in the formulation of the model , and present a new approach that yields a positive @xmath0 , so that the model closely resembles the conventional one .",
    "the mm involves a scalar field , @xmath1 , in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background metric .",
    "it is this field @xmath1 that we will be concentrating on in this paper .",
    "the treatment of both @xmath1 and the gravitational field in m6 is classical .",
    "important subsequent work has been done on the quantization of the fourth - order equations for the gravitational field that result from the conformal lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the scalar field , @xmath1 , however , has always been treated classically , a procedure that we will question in this paper .",
    "there are several things that are required of @xmath1 in a viable model :    @xmath2    an equation of motion that is conformally invariant .",
    "an energy - momentum tensor whose 00 component ( hamiltonian ) has an energy spectrum that is bounded below .    a constant vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 , derived from the equation of motion .",
    "the @xmath4 in the action generates the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 .    a @xmath5 term in the action that gives the correct sign for the cosmological constant .",
    "let us see whether these criteria are met in the mm . using ( as mannheim does ) a metric signature @xmath6 , and neglecting the coupling to the fermion field , the terms in mannheim s lagrangian involving @xmath1 are ( m6 ( 61 ) ) : @xmath7    this results in an equation of motion ( m6 ( 63 ) ) : @xmath8 this equation , as required ,",
    "is conformally invariant .",
    "@xmath1 is assumed to acquire a non - zero vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 , found by setting the derivative term in ( [ eq : s ] ) equal to zero .",
    "this gives @xmath9 as in @xcite ( 13 ) , with @xmath10 .",
    "further development of the model ( m6 , section 10 ) shows that , in order to meet observational criteria at the present time , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are both negative , so that @xmath4 is real and positive .",
    "the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 , in the mm turns out to be negative ( m6 ( 224 ) ) : @xmath13 choosing units with @xmath14 .",
    "the stress tensor in the mm model is obtained by taking the variation of the action with respect to the metric , in the usual way ( m6 ( 64 ) ; a similar expression is given in @xcite ) . retaining just the terms involving @xmath1 we get @xmath15    the lagrangian ( [ eq : l ] ) is analogous to the minkowski space lagrangian for a @xmath16 field theory ( @xcite ( 7.2.14 ) , with @xmath17 ) : @xmath18    the @xmath19 term in ( [ eq : l ] ) has the `` right '' sign for an @xmath20 term . but",
    "with @xmath21 , the @xmath22 term has the `` wrong '' sign , and , in a conventional treatment , will lead to a spectrum that is not bounded below .",
    "a theory of this sort has to be treated by methods appropriate to non - hermitean hamiltonians @xcite . at the level of quantum mechanics ,",
    "`` wrong sign '' @xmath16 theory is well developed .",
    "nevertheless , even in minkowski space , constructing a corresponding quantum field theory is a difficult problem , still incompletely understood @xcite .",
    "conformal cosmology will remain flawed until we can make progress in understanding the scalar field .",
    "a conformally invariant theory with a single scalar field has a unique action , m6 ( 61 ) , provided we use the familiar techniques appropriate for hermitean lagrangians .",
    "once we recognize that our theory involves a non - hermitean lagrangian , however , a new approach is suggested , that we introduce in this section .",
    "we begin by working in minkowski space , but retain @xmath23 and @xmath24 in formulae to simplify the transition to a frw space .",
    "a @xmath16 theory with a `` wrong sign '' @xmath16 term is non - hermitean but is nevertheless @xmath25 symmetric , and can be treated by the methods outlined in @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of this approach is the use of the @xmath26 norm in place of the usual dirac norm ; for a quantized field , @xmath27 , we write this norm as @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the usual parity and time - reversal operations , while @xmath31 represents a special operation designed to ensure the norm is real and positive definite and the theory is unitary .",
    "the @xmath31 operator has to be specifically calculated for each hamiltonian .",
    "our cosmological model is written in terms of classical fields ( expectation values , @xmath32 ) , which we take to be real .",
    "we assume @xmath33 can then be expressed as @xmath34_{\\forall \\rho : z^{\\rho } = -y^{\\rho } }   \\label{eq : cptdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( compare @xcite ( 78 ) ) , so that @xmath35_{\\forall \\rho : z^{\\rho } = -y^{\\rho } } s ( x ) \\label{eq : normex2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in an expression of this sort , @xmath36 and @xmath37 describe the field @xmath1 at the same physical point , but use different coordinate systems to refer to that point .",

    "mannheim points out ( m6 , section 10 ) that because the frw space is conformally flat , the cosmological equation of motion ( cem ) reduces to @xmath64    @xmath65 is just the sum of ( [ eq : t_mann3 ] ) and @xmath66 , the contribution from ordinary matter ( fermion fields , electromagnetic radiation , etc . ) .",

    "the equation analogous to m6 ( 226 ) is ( with @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 since @xmath75 for the open geometry of the mm , all three terms in ( [ eq : omega ] ) are positive , in contrast to m6 , where @xmath76 is negative .",
    "write the solution as in m6 ( 230 ) , with @xmath77 : @xmath78 @xmath79    the first term on the right of ( [ eq : r ] ) is negative , not positive as in the mm .",
    "this means that @xmath80 must start from zero , as in the standard cosmology , not from some finite value , as in the mm .",

    "part of the curve now lies below the horizontal axis , and is non - physical .",
    "the origin of @xmath83 is conventionally shifted to b , where @xmath85 . ]",
    "the present model has two features that are not present in conventional cosmology based on einstein s equations .",
    "first , the model includes a scalar field that is essentially massless .",
    "the non - zero vacuum expectation value of this field is essential , but we have ignored any excitations .",
    "this may be permissible because the field couples very weakly to normal matter , and is difficult to observe , or it may undergo a spontaneous transition that renders it massive .    second , mannheim uses ( [ eq : motion3 ] ) for his basic cosmological equation , rather than the more complete one that results from the conformal action , m6 ( 188 ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the weyl tensor , defined in m6 ( 107 ) , ( 108 ) and ( 185 ) .",
    "mannheim justifies the neglect of @xmath91 by observing that a frw metric is conformally flat , and in such a space @xmath92 .",
    "this is true , but if we are to include perturbations to the metric ( as , for example , in the study of anisotropies of the cmb ) then this neglected term may become important .",
    "we have pointed out two flaws in mannheim s conformal cosmological model .",
    "@xmath2    the model predicts , apparently unambiguously , a negative value for the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 .",
    "the model involves a scalar field , @xmath36 , that satisfies a conformally invariant equation of motion and develops a vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 .",
    "the values of the parameters that are needed to satisfy observations lead to a `` wrong sign @xmath22 theory '' , with a hamiltonian that has a spectrum that is unbounded below .",
    "we have attempted to apply the techniques appropriate for such hamiltonians to this cosmological problem , restricting ourselves to the classical limit of field equations that are still imperfectly understood . in this limit , using assumptions that appear reasonable , we find both a positive value for @xmath0 and a positive definite spectrum for the hamiltonian .",
    "our derivation depends on one simple observation , the change of sign as we go from ( [ eq : deltaika ] ) to ( [ eq : deltaikb ] ) .",
    "the derivation presented here will remain conjectural until progress is made in two main directions :    @xmath2    the techniques that have been successfully applied to @xmath16 quantum mechanics will have to be developed to cover the corresponding quantum field theory ; this seems not to have been achieved at this time @xcite .",
    "in particular , the form ( [ eq : cptdef ] ) for @xmath33 must be shown to be appropriate at the classical level .",
    "the various manipulations we have employed are suitable for minkowski space , but more detailed investigations are needed to show whether they can legitimately be extended to a frw space .    if , on the other hand , we can accept the present model as viable , without first filling in these important gaps in our understanding , then we have to face the difficult question : how can we conclusively distinguish this model from the conventional one ?    the department of physics at washington university , in particular carl bender , have given invaluable support to this retired colleague .",
    "the action is defined in ( [ eq : imink ] ) .",
