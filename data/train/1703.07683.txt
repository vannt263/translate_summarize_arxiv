    "quantum technologies are becoming reality , with huge efforts being devoted to developing scalable quantum computers and robust quantum communications , e.g. , for building a future quantum internet  @xcite . in this global scenario , quantum key distribution ( qkd )  @xcite is certainly one of the most advanced areas , with intense research activities directed towards practical implementations .",
    "qkd represents a set of strategies that , integrating both quantum and classical communication , allow two authorized remote users ( alice and bob ) to generate a random sequence of bits ; this is then used as an encryption key in a one - time pad protocol  @xcite , therefore providing an unconditionally secure ( information - theoretic  @xcite ) private communication between the remote users .",
    "the effectiveness of qkd relies on the ground rule of encoding classical information in non - orthogonal quantum states  @xcite , that are then transmitted through a noisy quantum channel controlled by the eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "this is also equivalent to sending the non - orthogonal part  of discordant quantum states  @xcite . in this way , eve s attack is bounded by fundamental laws of quantum physics  @xcite : any information gained by eve creates loss and noise on the quantum channel .",
    "thanks to this trade - off , alice and bob can accurately quantify the amount of classical error correction and privacy amplification needed to reduce eve s stolen information to a negligible amount  @xcite .    since the first proposals to implement quantum information and computational tasks , continuous variable ( cv ) systems have attracted increasing attention  @xcite .",
    "the fact of using quantum systems with continuous spectra ( infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces ) has several advantages with respect to the traditional approach based on discrete variables ( qubits ) .",
    "in particular , one can implement qkd at _ high rates _ by using highly - modulated coherent states and homodyne detections , not only in one - way schemes  @xcite , but also in two - way protocols  @xcite and  cv  strategies based on measurement - device independence ( mdi )  @xcite    ideal implementations of cv - qkd provide the highest key rates , not so far from the ultimate repeaterless bound recently established in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a lossy channel with transmissivity @xmath0 , the maximum rate achievable by any qkd  protocol ( secret - key capacity ) is equal to  @xcite @xmath1 , with a fundamental rate - loss scaling of @xmath2 bits per channel use for long distances , i.e. , at high loss @xmath3 .",
    "the most practical one - way cv - qkd protocols , i.e. , the switching  @xcite and no - switching  @xcite protocols , can potentially reach an asymptotic long - distance rate of @xmath4 bits per use , which is half the secret key capacity . similar performance for cv - mdi - qkd in the most asymmetric configuration  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we deepen the study of the secret key rates of the most known one - way cv - qkd protocols  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we explicitly study their security in the presence of gaussian two - mode attacks , representing the residual eavesdropping strategy after the de finetti symmetrization  @xcite over two - mode blocks . under these attacks",
    ", we derive the analytical expressions of the asymptotic key rates  @xcite . with these in hands",
    ", we show that eavesdropping strategies based on correlated ancillas turn out to be _ strictly _ less effective than gaussian attacks based on uncorrelated ancillas ( single - mode attacks ) .",
    "in other words , any two - mode gaussian attack with strictly non - zero correlations improves alice and bob s key rate .",
    "coherent states @xmath5 in an independent and identical fashion .",
    "these are sent through a quantum channel ( eve ) and received by bob , whose measurements provide the classical variables @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "eve s general eavesdropping is based on a global unitary operation , @xmath8 , applied to the @xmath9 instances of the one - way communication . * ( b ) *  after random permutations , the coherence of the general attack is confined within each two - mode block . * ( c ) *  within an arbitrary block , we show a gaussian two - mode attack against the protocol ( in eb representation ) .",
    "a realistic gaussian attack is simulated by two beam splitters , with transmissivity @xmath10 , mixing alice s signals , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with eve s ancillary modes , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , belonging to a larger set of modes @xmath15 in her hands .",

    "after @xmath9 uses of the channel , the parties share two correlated random sequences of symbols given by the sets @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    for the sake of clarity , we consider reverse reconciliation ( rr ) , so that the key is obtained by alice inferring bob s variables . now , when bob  applies homodyne _",

    "the security analysis considering this general scenario is not a practically solvable problem but , in the limit of @xmath27 , it has been proved @xcite that one can get rid of the cross - correlations between different uses of the channel .",
    "more specifically , with no loss of generality , the security analysis can be simplified by applying symmetric random permutations on the input ( @xmath22 ) and output ( @xmath28 )  classical data - sets .",
