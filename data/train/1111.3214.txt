    "the application of memory effects to the discrete systems signifies that their dynamics at time @xmath5 will depend only not on time @xmath6 , but on former times @xmath7 and so on . here",
    "time is equivalent to the number of step .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 can be substituted for @xmath5 as well as @xmath4 can be @xmath6 , and @xmath9 can be replaced by @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the introduction of a retardation of the linear term in the logistic equation modifies the feigenbaum scenario @xcite . in this case",
    "the periodic orbits are shifted .",
    "several forms of nonlinear maps with memory were also considered by a formal way in @xcite .",
    "last time the interest to the study of long - term memory effects and fractional kinetics in physical systems increased too much @xcite .",
    "the fractional operator with respect to time is characterized by long - term memory effects , whereas one with respect to coordinates possesses non - local ( long - range ) effects @xcite .",
    "the direct relationship among the long - term memory effects , fractional calculus and the stable distributions from the theory of probability has been established in @xcite . then it was shown @xcite that perturbed by a periodic force , the nonlinear oscillator with fractional derivative exhibits a chaotic motion called the fractional chaotic attractor .",
    "although the fractional nonlinear oscillator behaves like the stochastic attractor in phase space , being periodically perturbed , the role of the polynomial dissipation leads to a degradation of the attractor structure .",
    "the aim of this work is to present the analysis of the influence of long - term memory effects on the behavior of discrete systems .",
    "the paper starts with a discrete conception of long - term memory effects ( section  [ par2 ] ) .",
    "they are characterized by the parameter similar to the order index of fractional integral . by means of the computer simulation of bifurcation diagrams for the quadratic and triangular maps (",
    "section  [ par3 ] ) with the memory contribution , we demonstrates how the memory effects strangle the chaotic motion of discrete dynamical systems .",
    "the mapping @xmath11 does not have any memory , as the value @xmath12 only depends on @xmath13 .",
    "the introduction of memory means that the discrete value @xmath12 is connected with the previous values @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "particularly , any discrete system will have a full memory , if each state of the system is a simple sum of all previous states : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary function suitable for the discrete map .",
    "however , the above expression may tend to infinity because of the sum accumulating all the values . in order to have a fixed point in this mapping ,",
    "the expression should be normalized as @xmath20 when @xmath21 is a fixed point , the map ( [ eq1 ] ) gives @xmath22 the starting conjection is that the map under long - term memory is expressed in terms of @xmath23 where the weights @xmath24 and the parameter @xmath0 characterize the non - ideal memory effects .",
    "let the weights take the form @xmath25 in this connection it should be pointed out that the similar representation is used for the robast algorithm of numerical fractional integration @xcite .",
    "it has found an interesting application for the analysis of the nonlinear reaction with fractional dynamics @xcite as well as for the study of fractional oscillations @xcite .",
    "then the normalized mapping is written as @xmath26 here the sum starts with @xmath27 ( though it could be realized from @xmath28 ) by reason of the simplicity in writing the weights @xmath29 . to calculate the normalization factor presents no difficulty , namely @xmath30 it turns out that the factor is a power function just as one in our foregoing conjection .",
    "now consider the following limit cases .",
    "if @xmath31 , the memory is absent . really , in this case all the weights are equal to zero with the exception of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we come to an ordinary map @xmath11 . for @xmath33",
    "the memory effects will be full , namely @xmath34 then this map becomes @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the full memory is ideal because each new state of the discrete system sticks to the system s memory and has the same action upon next states as all the others in memory .",
    "when @xmath1 , the memory effects have a long - term dependence so that @xmath36 certainly the memory is not ideal , as the contribution of more early states is noticeably less than the contribution of following ones on the present state of such systems .",
    "this is something like a part of system states being lost .",
    "recall that if a system does not remember any previous state except for the present , it has no memory effects .    in the next section",
    "we will show the results of numerical simulations for the triangular and quadratic maps under the long - term memory effects .",
    "this allows us to estimate their influence on the evolution of the discrete systems .",
    "the memory effects are governed by means of the parameter @xmath0 , whereas the parameter of type @xmath37 serves as an order parameter for the onset of chaos .",
    "the triangular map is expressed in terms of the function @xmath38 and the quadratic map is written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are constants .",
    "these logistic maps are very popular in the theory of deterministic chaos .",
    "they help easily to understand main features of discrete dynamical systems . in particular , the quadratic map is the simplest nonlinear difference equation , appears in many contexts , for example , a strongly damped kicked rotator or the growth model of a population in a closed area @xcite . for the triangular map with @xmath41 the origin",
    "@xmath42 is the only stable fixed point to which all points in the interval @xmath43 $ ] are attracted .",
    "the value @xmath37 plays a role of `` order parameter '' , which indicates the onset of chaos . for @xmath44",
    "two unstable fixed points emerge .",
    "if the magnitude of the parameter @xmath37 increases still more , then the information about the position of a point in @xmath43 $ ] is lost .",
    "this may result in chaos .",
    "the function @xmath45 is a simple model which for @xmath44 generates chaotic sequences @xmath46 , \\dots$ ] , and due to its simple form , all quantities in this chaotic state can be calculated explicitly .",
    "we go the same way for the maps taking into account the long - term memory effects .    the bifurcation diagrams for the triangular logistic map with long - term memory effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 accounts for the memory contribution , the constant @xmath37 relates to the onset of chaos for this map ( all details in the text).,width=12 ]    the long - term memory distinguishes itself by a slow decay contribution of former values for discrete maps .",
    "the procedure of calculating the string of system states requires to evaluate in the coefficients @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the duration of calculations notably increases with the growth of @xmath4 . to remember `` the simple dynamical systems do not necessarily lead to simple dynamical behavior '' @xcite",
    ", we guess that a weak memory effects with @xmath47 almost will not influence on the complicated behavior of such discrete systems . by means of numerical simulation",
    "we establish the evolution of the simple logistic maps under long - term memory , when the parameter @xmath0 tends to one . for this purpose",
    "the bifurcation diagram is constructed .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a set of bifurcation diagrams to the triangular map with various values @xmath0 . a number of diagrams , represented in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , corresponds to the quadratic case . the number of iterations @xmath4 equals to 3500 . in these figures it is seen that the memory effects step - by - step in the growth of @xmath0 block up the development of chaotic behavior in the logistic maps .",
    "after @xmath48 the evolution of the given maps tends to a regular stable fixed point .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams for the quadratic logistic map with long - term memory effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 characterizes the memory influence , the value @xmath49 is the constant of the map ( see details in the text).,width=12 ]    what can we say about a sequence of iterates if there are unstable fixed points ?",
    "the @xmath4th iterate @xmath50 is piecewise linear and has the slope @xmath51 , except for the countable set of points @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the liapunov exponent measures the average loss of information about the position of a point in @xmath43 $ ] after one iteration .",
    "for the general triangular map under long - term memory effects the liapunov exponent becomes @xmath54 the equality @xmath55 holds true for @xmath31 , when any memory effects are missing . if @xmath1 , then the liapunov exponent decreases .",
    "therefore , the chaotic states typical for the ordinary triangular map die out with the growth of memory effects , i.  e.  when the parameter @xmath0 tends to one .",
    "we have shown that if a discrete dynamical system is exposed to the long - term memory effects , then the chaotic sequences which are presented in the system without any memory are squeezed out . as the memory mounts , chaos and",
    "its traces disappear .",
    "the magnitude @xmath56 looks like a `` critical point '' that indicates a transition from chaos to order .",
    "it should be noticed that the fine structure in the iterates for the maps is just washed out because of the memory effects .",
    "nevertheless , for sufficiently small values of @xmath0 there is still a remarkable transition to chaos .",
