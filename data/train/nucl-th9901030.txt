    "the study of the properties of strangeness - rich systems is of fundamental importance in understanding relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite and some astrophysical problems  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative features of such systems and their possible detection in the universe and in relativistic heavy - ion collisions were first discussed by bodmer  @xcite in 1971 . within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , it was suggested that the strangeness - rich systems could be strange quark systems consisting of up ( @xmath8 ) , down ( @xmath9 ) , and strange ( @xmath10 ) quarks . these exotic systems could be either metastable states  @xcite against the decays into hadrons , or absolute bound states with energies much lower than normal nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical calculations for strange quark systems are still in the developing stage . for example , within the mit bag model it is found  @xcite that the stability of the bag strongly depends on the rather uncertain bag constant @xmath11 .",
    "the strange quark matter is absolutely stable for @xmath12 mev , metastable for @xmath13@xmath14 mev , and unstable for @xmath15 mev .",
    "therefore , one can not rule out the possibility that the strangeness - rich systems could be strange hadron systems made of nucleons and hyperons ; as studied , for example , in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the production and detection of strangeness - rich matter from relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been studied in recent years  @xcite .",
    "two scenarios have been discussed .",
    "the first one is the coalescent mechanism  @xcite , which assumes that the produced hyperons are captured by the nearby nuclear fragments in the freeze - out region to form multi - hyperon clusters .",
    "the second mechanism is the distillation process  @xcite associated with the production of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the baryon - rich region .",
    "the essential idea is that the @xmath16 quarks in a qgp , in which @xmath17 pairs are abundant , are captured by the surrounding @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks , liberated from the initial heavy ions , to form @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the emission of these kaons and other mesons causes cooling of the qgp into a strange quark system .",
    "the interesting question to ask is whether this system will be absolutely stable or metastable against the collapse into a hadron system .",
    "this question can be answered by comparing the energy of such a system with the energy of a strange hadron system with the same strangeness quantum number .",
    "it is therefore important to develop theoretical approaches to calculate the energies of strange hadron systems . in this paper",
    ", we report on the first results of our efforts in this direction .",
    "the calculation for the strange quark systems with similar sophistication is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "most of the recent investigations of strange hadron systems have been done by using the relativistic mean - field model  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual @xmath20 and @xmath21 mesons , these models also contain @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons , introduced in order to have strong attractive hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "the vector coupling constants are chosen according to su(6 ) symmetry , while the scalar coupling constants are fixed to hypernuclear data .",
    "extensive calculations for the systems consisting of @xmath24 mixtures have been performed .",
    "clearly , these calculations are not completely consistent with the su(3 ) symmetry , since @xmath2 s are not included ( for reasons which will be discussed below ) .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear that the values for the coupling constants employed in these models are consistent with the very extensive data on nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath25 ) and hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath26 ) reactions .",
    "a rigorous prediction should be consistent with both the two - body data and the data of hypernuclei .",
    "an alternative approach is based on the many - body theory with baryon - baryon potential models .",
    "this was first pursued by pandharipande  @xcite using a variational method and rather crude baryon - baryon potentials .",
    "this approach has recently be revived in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation and the nijmegen soft - core @xmath26 potential  @xcite of 1989 . there",
    ", the authors only consider an infinite system consisting of @xmath1 s and nucleons .",
    "it was found that for a given total baryon density @xmath27 the binding energy per baryon , @xmath28 , decreases as the fraction of strangeness , @xmath29 , increases .",
    "the most stable system in their approach has @xmath30 mev , at @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 . comparing with the calculations using relativistic mean - field models",
    "as described above , this investigation is rather incomplete since the role of @xmath3 is not explored , owing to the restriction of the employed nijmegen potential .",
    "the importance of @xmath3 was pointed out in ref .",
    "it is needed to stabilize the system against the strong @xmath34 process , which can occur at relatively low density of @xmath1 since the threshold energy for this reaction to occur is only about 28 mev .",
    "the presence of @xmath3 will pauli block this reaction .",
    "furthermore , their calculations do not include hyperon - hyperon interactions and hence the effects of additional hyperons on the hyperon mean field are neglected in solving the self - consistent @xmath35-matrix equation .",
    "in this paper we try to be as complete as possible in that we include all possible interaction channels that are allowed for the baryon octet .",
    "we use the recently constructed nsc97 baryon - baryon potential models  @xcite to describe all these channels .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly highlight some of the features of the employed baryon - baryon potential models . in sec .  [",

    "in this paper , we report on the first results from an investigation of strange hadron matter using the most recently developed baryon - baryon potentials  @xcite .",
    "these potentials are constructed within the dynamics defined by the su(3 ) symmetry , and the data of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath25 ) and hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath26 ) reactions .",
    "we follow a similar brueckner - hartree - fock formulation as recently employed by schulze _",
    "et al . _",

    "the presence of @xmath3 then also enforces us to consider the @xmath42 and @xmath43 channels of strangeness @xmath44 , and the @xmath45 channel of strangeness @xmath46 .",
    "the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry allows us to unambiguously define the baryon - baryon interactions for the @xmath47 systems from the previously constructed @xmath25 and @xmath26 interactions .",
    "however , because of the lack of sufficiently accurate @xmath26 data and some uncertainties in su(3 ) coupling constants , the constructed baryon - baryon potentials have some model dependence . in ref .",
    "@xcite , six @xmath26 models have been constructed , based on different choices for the vector - magnetic @xmath48 ratio , @xmath49 .",
    "values range from @xmath50 for model nsc97a to @xmath51 for model nsc97f .",
    "the different choices for @xmath49 ( consistent with static or relativistic su(6 ) predictions ) are chosen such that the models encompass a range of scattering lengths in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 channels , but all models describe the @xmath26 scattering data equally well .",
    "differences show up in more elaborate applications such as hypernuclear calculations ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion . in this paper",
    "we will only consider models nsc97e and nsc97f , which seem to be the most consistent with the existing hypernuclear data  @xcite .",
    "another important assumption in the construction of the baryon - baryon potentials is that the su(3 ) symmetry is applied to the full range of the interaction ; i.e. , to the long - range as well as to the short - range part .",
    "although there is no empirical evidence that the short - range part indeed satisfies the su(3 ) symmetry ( there are no @xmath54 scattering data to test this assumption , for example , with these potential models ) , we have chosen for this approach since it allows us to extend the @xmath25 and @xmath26 interactions to all @xmath54 interactions describing the @xmath47 systems , without having to introduce any new parameters . to illustrate the differences between the various interactions , we show in fig .",
    "[ strange : phs1s0 ] the @xmath55 elastic phase shifts for the two models in the @xmath25 , @xmath37 , @xmath56 , and @xmath45 channels .",
    "the differences between nsc97e and nsc97f are fairly small and , at this scale , will only show up in the @xmath37 channel .",
    "a more detailed description of the nsc97 potential models in the @xmath54 channels will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in the next section we will present the results of several brueckner - hartree - fock calculations using the baryon - baryon potentials for the @xmath58 systems , and so here we review some of the aspects of the @xmath35 matrix and define the relevant quantities . in each case , the ( strange ) nuclear matter is characterized by a total density @xmath59 , which is broken up into the contributions from the four baryon species according to @xmath60 this also defines the fermi momentum @xmath61 for a baryon @xmath62 with density fraction @xmath63 . as standard , we define the @xmath35 matrix @xmath64 for incoming ( unprimed ) and outgoing ( primed ) momenta . defining mass fractions @xmath65 ,",

    "the single - particle potentials @xmath74 are defined by @xmath75 .",
    "\\label{sppot}\\ ] ] hence , we have two equations , eqs .",
    "( [ bgequ ] ) and ( [ sppot ] ) , which have to be solved self - consistently .    in our calculations",
    "we have made several approximations .",
    "first of all , the energies are treated in the nonrelativistic expansion , as is obvious from the @xmath76 expansion in eq .",
    "( [ spener ] ) .",
    "the same @xmath76 expansion was used in the derivation of the nsc97 potentials  @xcite .",
    "brockmann and machleidt  @xcite have demonstrated the effect on nuclear - matter results when one uses instead the relativistic energies and the dirac equation for the single - particle motion ; these type of calculations have become known as dirac - brueckner calculations . for purely nuclear matter they find that the saturation point shifts to lower density and has a smaller binding energy per nucleon . in analogy with their result",
    ", we expect that a proper dirac - brueckner calculation for strange nuclear matter will also show a shift of saturation points as compared to what we find in our present brueckner - hartree - fock calculations",
    ". however , we believe that the calculations presented here suffice for our purpose , which is to study the general features of strange nuclear matter .",
    "any shift of saturation points is only expected to be relevant in those cases where the matter under consideration is on the boundary of being bound or unbound . in those cases ,",
    "the dirac - brueckner result might show that matter which we find to be just bound is actually unbound , or vice versa .",
    "a second approximation is that the single - particle potential is radically put to zero for momenta @xmath77 above the fermi sea : the so - called `` standard '' choice .",
    "this causes a discontinuous jump in @xmath78 at @xmath79 , and so it is also known as the `` gap '' choice .",
    "an alternative choice is to retain a nonzero value for momenta above the fermi sea : the so - called `` continuous '' choice  @xcite .",
    "there are various physical arguments which favor this latter choice  @xcite , but its main effect is to merely shift the saturation curve to give more binding , without changing the overall density dependence very much ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the effect in ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "however , these differences are only of relevance on a quantitative level ( e.g. , when a comparison is made with the experimental saturation point ) , and so we argue that for this first study of the general features of strange nuclear matter it suffices to use the gap choice .",
    "another motivation is that the continuous choice considerably complicates the propagator in the bethe - goldstone equation , which makes the calculations much more cumbersome and computer intensive .",
    "a further simplification in the self - consistency calculation is that we assume a quadratic momentum dependence for the single - particle potential @xmath80 .",
    "this means that we can define an effective baryon mass @xmath81 in terms of which the single - particle energy can be written as    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is easily obtained from eq .",

    "( [ starb ] ) is that the self - consistency condition only needs to be calculated at @xmath86 and @xmath87 , rather than at a range of momentum values @xmath88 , as required when using eq .",
    "( [ stara ] ) . also , the binding energy does not require a numerical integration , but is easily done analytically .",
    "we checked for various cases that the parameterization of eq .",

    "the results for the two nsc97 models are practically indistinguishable , which , in fact , is true for all six nsc97 models .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that these models all describe the @xmath25 scattering data equally well .",
    "we see that the pure @xmath1 system is not bound at all for both models .",
    "the pure @xmath1 system was calculated including the coupling to the @xmath40 and @xmath39 channels .",
    "if this coupling is switched off ( and so only elastic @xmath37 scattering is possible ) , the curves shift to slightly higher values : about 10% higher for nsc97e and about 5% higher for nsc97f .",
    "the pure @xmath3 system is more bound and saturates at higher densities than the nucleon system .",
    "the difference in the results for nsc97e and nsc97f is due to the fact that the @xmath126 partial - wave contribution to the single - particle potential ( which is large and positive ) for nsc97f is almost 40% larger than for nsc97e .",
    "in addition , the @xmath127 partial - wave contribution ( which is also large , but negative ) for nsc97f is about 10% less attractive and largely compensates for an increased attraction in the @xmath55 partial - wave contribution .",
    "an important part of the attraction is due to the scalar - exchange part of the potential . since the existence of a nonet of scalar mesons with masses below 1 gev/@xmath128 is still highly controversial ( especially the low - mass isoscalar @xmath20 meson ) , a comment is in order .",
    "we first note that within a one - boson - exchange model for the @xmath25 interaction , the scalar - exchange contribution plays a crucial role in providing the required attraction . whether this contribution represents a true exchange of scalar mesons or just an effective parameterization of two - pion exchange and more complicated interactions is a question which goes beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we only want to mention that arbitrarily removing the @xmath20 ( or , in our case  @xcite , the broad @xmath129 ) contribution renders purely nuclear matter unbound at all densities . however , the pure @xmath3 system still remains bound , although it saturates at a smaller density .",

    "[ strange : purebb ] represents the result without the coulomb interaction and is included for illustrative purposes only .",
    "the difference in the results for nsc97e and nsc97f is due to the fact that the single - particle potential for nsc97f is slightly more attractive for almost all partial - wave contributions , which adds up to a substantial difference in the total single - particle potential .",
    "the results of these calculations show that for the employed baryon - baryon models of ref .  @xcite the only possible long - lived strange pure system within su(3 ) is the @xmath3 system , which is stable against strong decays .",

    "first of all , the larger binding energy found in ref .",
    "@xcite is due to the fact that they use the continuous choice for the single - particle energy , whereas we use the gap choice . the smaller density at which their saturation occurs is due to the different @xmath25 potential that is employed : they use the parameterized paris @xmath25 potential  @xcite , whereas here we use the @xmath25 potential as given by the nsc97 models .",
    "furthermore , the results of ref .",

    "we _ do _ include the @xmath37 interaction and , although we find that the contribution of @xmath147 to the total single - particle potential is rather small , its influence starts to become noticeable as the @xmath1 density increases . at low @xmath1 density the individual partial - wave contributions to @xmath147",
    "are almost all negative , but as the @xmath1 density increases some of them start to give ( relatively important ) positive contributions . as a consequence ,",
    "the effect of the inclusion of the @xmath37 interaction for increasing @xmath148 is to shift the density at which saturation occurs to lower values .",

    "this suggests that a charge - neutral strangeness - rich system is unlikely to be seen in nature or to be created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we now turn to investigating the dependence of the binding energy of the @xmath157 system on the strangeness per baryon .",
    "as discussed in previous works  @xcite , this dependence is most relevant to the investigation of relativistic heavy - ion collisions . for this purpose , it is useful to define the fractions @xmath158 for the different species @xmath159 , as in eq .",

    "but it is more likely that the difference is due to the differences in dynamical content of the calculations .",
    "this can be understood by observing that the mean - field calculation within the brueckner - hartree - fock approach amounts to neglecting the residual baryon - baryon interaction terms in calculating @xmath177 .",
    "namely , the mean - field results can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ bind ] ) by making the change @xmath178 in eq .",
    "( [ bind ] ) . in all of the cases , @xmath179 is comparable to kinetic energies and , hence , the finite - size mean - field results can be radically different from our full calculations .",
    "although the @xmath2 particles can be easily annihilated , as stated before , their presence largely increases the binding of the system , which might be of relevance in the formation and stability of such a system . to demonstrate the effect of adding @xmath2 s we first consider a charge - neutral @xmath5 system with @xmath181 , and so @xmath182 . for each choice of @xmath181",
    "we can add different fractions of @xmath2 s as long as @xmath183 .",
    "note that these systems all still have @xmath182 . in order to prevent having to show numerous figures or tables ,",
    "we will here only consider the systems with @xmath184 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ strange : sigma ] .",
    "they should be compared with the saturation minima in fig .",
    "[ strange : lfracnx ] .",
    "we clearly see that adding also @xmath2 s drastically improves the binding of the system compared to adding only @xmath1 s .    the increase in binding due to adding @xmath2 s allows us to further explore the @xmath6 dependence in the region beyond @xmath185 . again , numerous choices for the different particle fractions are possible , but here we will only restrict ourselves to systems with equal fractions for the strange particles , i.e. , @xmath186 .",
    "we find that these systems are bound for any value of @xmath187 .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of this mixed system is shown in fig .",
    "[ strange : sperb ] .",
    "we see that as @xmath6 increases , the system becomes more bound , except in the low @xmath6 region .",
    "note that at the highest @xmath188 , the system is the pure @xmath3 system as in fig .",
    "[ strange : purebb ] .",
    "of course , our special choice for @xmath187 means that the strangeness per baryon can only go up to @xmath189 , and so the result for @xmath190 in fig .",
    "[ strange : sperb ] is not calculated , but is rather obtained by simply extrapolating to the pure @xmath3 result which has @xmath188 .",
    "comparing with the results of fig .",
    "[ strange : nlxmix ] for the @xmath5 system , it is clear that the addition of the @xmath2 component drastically changes the @xmath6 dependence , but it is important to remember here that the system containing @xmath2 is highly unstable against strong decays , as discussed above .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ strange : sperb ] perhaps can not be verified in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , it could represent the situation in the core of neutron stars in which the presence of high density @xmath191 can produce a lot of @xmath133 , initiated by the reaction @xmath192 .",
    "we have investigated strange hadron matter in the context of a baryon - baryon potential model based on su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the parameters of the potential model were fitted to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 scattering data , and the assumption of ( broken ) su(3 ) symmetry allows us to extend the model to also describe the other interaction channels that are allowed for the baryon octet ; i.e. , the @xmath54 , @xmath40 , @xmath193 , and @xmath45 interactions .",
    "the potential for these interactions is defined without the necessity of having to introduce new free parameters .",
    "the calculations have been carried out by using the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation . within the framework that we use to define the potential model for the baryon - baryon interactions , we find that the pure @xmath1 system is unbound , whereas the pure @xmath3 system is more strongly bound and saturates at higher densities than the pure @xmath0 system . adding @xmath1 s to pure nuclear matter slightly increases binding , as long as the @xmath1 fraction is less than about 10% .",
    "larger fractions cause a decrease in binding . adding @xmath3 s , of importance due to the reaction @xmath155 ,",
    "drastically reduces binding , and so @xmath5 systems are only ( weakly ) bound for nucleon fractions larger than 40% .",
    "our results represent a step forward , since the previous brueckner - hartree - fock calculation  @xcite did not include the @xmath3 s .    by carrying out extensive calculations for the @xmath5 and @xmath7 systems ,",
    "we have predicted the dependence of the binding energy on the strangeness per baryon , a quantity that is needed to be determined as precisely as possible for identifying the strange quark matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "our results are significantly different from previous calculations based on relativistic mean - field models .",
    "we argue that the differences are mainly due to the two - body correlations , which are neglected in relativistic mean - field models .    to close",
    ", we would like to point out that the present work is merely a first step towards a rigorous many - body calculation . in the future",
    ", we need to investigate the three - body terms in the brueckner - hartree - fock approach .",
    "this is particularly important if one is to give more precise predictions in the higher - density regions .",
    "another reason is that perhaps it is only at that order that the issue of using the gap choice or the continuous choice for the single - particle energies in solving the self - consistent eqs .",
    "( [ bgequ ] ) and ( [ sppot ] ) becomes irrelevant , as was shown in a recent work on ordinary nuclear matter  @xcite .",
