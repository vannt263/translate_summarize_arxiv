    "the fact that the time evolution of position and momentum expectation values follows hamilton s equations of motion , if the potential is at most quadratic , turns up in any quantum mechanics course .",
    "in contrast the characteristics of the corresponding dynamics of quantal uncertainties are in general not presented in courses and textbooks - apart from the folk theorem about the spreading of the wave packet for the free particle which only holds under certain conditions .    therefore a self - contained derivation and discussion of the behavior of quantal uncertainties for this special class of potentials seems to be useful for the student to complete his or her basic knowledge of quantum mechanics as well as for the researcher who wants to start work in some area of quantum dynamics .",
    "this article contains a complete analysis of the dynamics of position and momentum uncertainties of wave packets moving in at most quadratic potentials according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "some of the results we produce are already given in @xcite .",
    "but we obtain them without restricting to certain wave packets and we consider the whole range of initial values , identifying all possible kinds of dynamic behavior . we especially investigate which initial values lead to spreading and which to narrowing of wave packets .    we find that for potentials which allow unbounded motion all wave packets will spread after a certain time .",
    "it turns out that the initial values of position and momentum uncertainties are not enough to prescribe the time evolution of these two quantities , but together with the initial value of the so - called mixed uncertainty the dynamics of all three quantities is determined .",
    "we explain the relation of the mixed uncertainty and the chirp , which is defined for gaussian wave packets , and also investigate the time evolution of both quantities .",
    "this article is structured as follows : section  [ equ ] contains the derivation of the differential equations which govern the uncertainty dynamics .",
    "we further introduce the mixed uncertainty and the chirp and identify the constants of motion . in section",
    "[ free ] the reader will find the uncertainty analysis for at most linear potentials .",
    "section  [ ho ] covers the case of the harmonic oscillator , and finally the unstable harmonic oscillator is treated in section  [ uho ] .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of wave packets subject to a hamiltonian @xmath0 where the potential v(x ) has the form @xmath1 the evolution of the expectation value of any time - independent operator @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 \\right\\rangle \\quad.\\ ] ] therefore the position and momentum expectation values evolve according to newton s equations @xmath4 for the first and second time derivative of the position and momentum uncertainties @xmath5 we find in an arbitrary potential , using the abbreviations @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,    [ deltapa ] @xmath8    equation ( [ deltaxpa ] ) does not require any information about the potential .",
    "we will call the quantity on the right hand side , which characterizes the first derivative of the position uncertainty , the mixed uncertainty :    @xmath9    the mixed uncertainty is always real , but not necessarily positive , which distinguishes it from the position and momentum uncertainty . in accordance with ( [ deltaxpa ] )",
    "the sign of the mixed uncertainty determines if the wave packet is going to spread or narrow at a given time .",
    "this particular statement is true for an arbitrary potential since we have not used the special form of the potential ( [ quadratisch ] ) for the calculation of ( [ deltapa ] ) .",
    "moreover @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy the inequality @xmath12 which is stronger than heisenberg s uncertainty inequality @xcite . for gaussian wave packets the inequality ( [ genu ] ) becomes an equality ( for more about gauss functions see below ) .",
    "if we insert the expression of the mixed uncertainty ( [ mixed ] ) and use the special form of the potential ( [ quadratisch ] ) the equations ( [ deltapa ] ) become    [ deltap ] @xmath13    the equations ( [ deltaxpp ] ) and ( [ deltappp ] ) represent a system of two linear second order differential equations which has a unique solution for fixed initial values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in order to fulfill equation ( [ deltaxp ] )",
    "the initial value of @xmath16 has to be chosen in accordance with the initial mixed uncertainty .",
    "but if finally equation ( [ deltapp ] ) should also be satisfied , the relation @xmath17 must hold for all times . since a closer look at the system ( [ deltaxpp],[deltappp ] ) reveals @xmath18 we see that the constraint equation([constraint ] ) is fulfilled during the time evolution of the system ( [ deltaxpp],[deltappp ] ) if it is only satisfied at @xmath19 .",
    "so we get a unique solution for ( [ deltap ] ) if we solve ( [ deltaxpp],[deltappp ] ) and choose the initial values according to ( [ deltaxp ] , [ deltapp ] ) .",
    "the system ( [ deltap ] ) has two constants of motions , namely @xmath20    the conservation of @xmath21 is equivalent to the constraint equation ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "@xmath22 is just the left side of the inequality ( [ genu ] ) .",
    "the conservation of @xmath22 can be derived carrying out the time derivative of @xmath22 and using ( [ deltaxp],[deltapp],[deltaxpp ] ) .",
    "if the mixed uncertainty takes the value zero , which is in particular the case when @xmath23 or @xmath24 have an extreme value ( see ( [ deltaxp],[deltapp ] ) ) , the uncertainty product p takes the value of its global minimum @xmath25    the initial values for the three uncertainties can in general be chosen arbitrarily , as long as the generalized uncertainty relation ( [ genu ] ) is satisfied .",
    "but of course all three quantities are determined , if a certain wave packet is given .",
    "in particular , a gaussian wave packet of the shape    @xmath26    has the properties @xmath27 so we see that the mixed uncertainty is proportional to the parameter a , which is also called chirp since its effect on the wavefunction looks like the modulation of the frequency of a signal characterized by @xmath28 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath29 the wave packet fulfills heisenberg s uncertainty relation exactly so that @xmath24 is determined by @xmath23 .",
    "the freedom to choose @xmath30 in the range @xmath31 implies the freedom to choose @xmath24 independently of @xmath23 as long as heisenberg s uncertainty is not violated .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 determine the mixed uncertainty according to ( [ properties ] ) , which finally leads to : @xmath32 so we see that the inequality ( [ genu ] ) becomes an equality for gaussian wave packets .",
    "this property will be preserved if the gaussian wave packet is subject to a time evolution governed by an at most quadratic hamiltonian , since @xmath22 ( [ konstante ] ) is a constant of motion .",
    "this result is in accordance with the often used fact that a gaussian wave packet of the form ( [ gaussian ] ) evolves as a gaussian if the potential is at most quadratic ( for a proof see for instance @xcite )",
    ". therefore the time evolution of a gaussian wave packet ( [ gaussian ] ) subject to an at most quadratic hamiltonian is described by the functions @xmath33 which represent the time evolution of the characteristic parameters .",
    "the results for @xmath34 can be determined by ( [ properties ] ) , if the solutions of ( [ deltap ] ) are given .",
    "all gaussian wave packets with the property @xmath35 fulfill heisenberg s uncertainty relation exactly and are therefore called minimum uncertainty states .",
    "since the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not appear in the equations ( [ deltap ] ) , the dynamics of uncertainties is the same for all potentials of the form @xmath38 in this case the momentum uncertainty is a constant of motion , @xmath39 with the initial values @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( [ deltaxpp ] ) and ( [ deltaxp ] ) yield    [ deltaf ] @xmath42    the mixed uncertainty is a monotonically increasing function in time .",

    "if @xmath44 , @xmath23 is monotonically decreasing until it reaches its minimum at @xmath45    when the mixed uncertainty is zero . at @xmath46",
    "the uncertainty product also has its minimum value and the minimum value of the position uncertainty reads in accordance with ( [ result ] )    @xmath47    a wave packet that starts with a negative mixed uncertainty is going to narrow until @xmath46 .",
    "if we insert @xmath48 in ( [ tmin ] ) , we find @xmath49 this means that for any @xmath50 and for any initial uncertainty product @xmath51 , @xmath52 can take any given value in the interval @xmath53 .",
    "so it may take arbitrary long time until the wave packet stops narrowing and starts to spread which is the behavior commonly expected from a free particle wave packet .",

    "furthermore the mixed uncertainty always goes from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . if the initial wavefunction is a gaussian wave packet ( @xmath67 ) , the equations ( [ properties ] , [ gaussianu ] ) and ( [ orbitsf ] ) yield for the chirp",
