    "thanks to the recent progress made in atom and ion cooling and trapping , laser stabilization and high - resolution optical spectroscopy , narrow optical transitions are considered as a basis for frequency standards . at this time , two kinds of experiments are under study in various groups : one uses an ensemble of laser - cooled neutral atoms in a fountain , an optical lattice or a bec , the other one uses a single trapped laser - cooled ion ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . the present work is motivated by strong progress in storing , cooling and coherently manipulating single ions in paul traps . together with the ultra - precise optical frequency measurements achieved by frequency chains and frequency combs , these progress lead to the realization of single - ion frequency standards , as for hg@xmath6@xcite , sr@xmath6@xcite , yb@xmath6@xcite and in@xmath6@xcite , and proposed for ca@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our experimental project aims to build an optical frequency standard using the electric quadrupole transition @xmath7 of a single calcium ion at 729 nm . among the frequency standard candidates , ca@xmath3 possesses the major advantage that the required radiations for cooling and exciting the clock transition can be produced directly by solid state or diode lasers .",
    "in addition , the existence of an isotope having semi - integer nuclear spin ( @xmath8 ) allows to eliminate the first order zeeman shift , canceling a major source of line shift and broadening .",
    "the performances of a frequency standard are defined by the stability of its local oscillator ( a laser in the optical case ) and the precision achieved in the observation of an atomic transition .",
    "frequency instability is due to deviations from a mean frequency throughout varying probe time intervals , while frequency uncertainty is caused by the atomic frequency fluctuations induced by environmental conditions and by the experimental conditions for observation .",
    "the quality factor of optical atomic transitions can reach 10@xmath9 , which is 5 orders of magnitude higher than for microwave frequency standards and thus let hope better ultimate performances than the existing standards .    the interrogation scheme used to probe",
    "the atomic transition influences the frequency stability of the proposed standard via the variation of the duration of the probe cycle . in the first part of this paper",
    "we discuss the choice of this scheme , by using numerical simulations to compare single - pulse spectroscopy with time - domain ramsey interferometry .",
    "systematic effects expected for a standard based on @xmath2ca@xmath6 may reduce its accuracy and precision , they are discussed in the second part . for this evaluation , we employ the specific parameters of the ca@xmath6-ion trap experiment in marseille @xcite as an example , but the discussion is kept as general as possible to remain applicable to other atomic species .",
    "frequency stability is one of the major characteristics of a frequency standard .",
    "it can be quantified by the allan deviation @xmath10 measured for an average time @xmath1 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the quality factor defined by the ratio of the clock frequency over its observed linewidth , @xmath13 the signal to noise ratio and @xmath14 the cycle time required for the interrogation of the ion .    the schemes to probe an optical transition of a single ion consist of a preparation stage , an excitation of the clock transition , and a final detection stage .",
    "the cycle time @xmath14 is the sum of the corresponding time durations @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . during the preparation stage , the ion is laser cooled and optically pumped into the internal state chosen to be the ground state ( see figure [ fig_lasers ] ) .",
    "is of the order of 20 mhz whereas @xmath18 is of the order of 1 hz . ]",
    "the light scattered by the cooling transition is also used for detection of the ion .",
    "the probing of the clock transition by the local oscillator ( a laser ) is done by direct laser excitation . during this stage ,",
    "all the preparation lasers are shut off .",
    "after excitation of the clock transition , the cooling lasers are switched on again . the quantum jump method @xcite allows then to know if the atom is excited or not : the absence of fluorescence during the detection stage proves that the ion is `` shelved '' in the metastable upper state whereas the presence of fluorescence signal means that the ion is still in the cooling cycle .",
    "repetition of this measurement as a function of the clock laser frequency allows to measure the transition probability distribution . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the laser characteristics and the maximum duration required for these various stages .",
    "the choice of the suited interrogation scheme is essential to minimize the allan deviation .",
    "we suppose the ion cooled to the doppler limit in an rf - trap and located at the center of the trap , where the rf - trapping field is minimum and has little influence on the ion motion . since the trap creates a quasi - harmonic potential , the motion of the ion is a superposition of oscillations at different frequencies due to the spatial anisotropy of the trapping device .",
    "if we suppose , for simplicity s sake , that there is only one frequency of motion @xmath19 in the trap , the resulting atomic absorption spectrum is composed of a central frequency corresponding to the atomic transition @xmath20 and sidebands separated by multiples of the motional frequency @xmath21 , ( @xmath22 integer ) .",
    "the sidebands are resolved if the width of each band is smaller than their mutual separation ( the strong confinement condition @xcite ) .",
    "this can be achieved in miniature traps with high motional frequencies ( @xmath23 mhz ) for all the narrow transitions considered as potential basis for frequency standards ( @xmath24 , see figure [ fig_lasers ] ) .",
    "the intensity of each band @xmath22 in the spectrum depends on the oscillation amplitude @xmath25 of the ion in the trap like @xmath26 @xcite where @xmath27 is the laser wavevector of the probed transition and @xmath28 the bessel function of order @xmath22 . as the functions @xmath26 have negligeable values when @xmath29 , the smaller is @xmath30 , the less sidebands are visible .",
    "laser - cooling the ion reduces its oscillation amplitude @xmath25 and thus the number of observable sidebands .",
    "a major step in the preparation of the ion is to access the lamb - dicke regime which is characterized by the reduction of the spectrum to few sidebands with a preponderant weight on the central frequency , this regime is reached if @xmath31 .",
    "the motion of the ion can be described by the occupation rate of the vibrational quantum levels , characterised by the mean vibrational quantum number @xmath32 .",
    "this vibrational state can also be characterized from the classical point of view by an oscillation amplitude @xmath33 , where the length @xmath34 measures the size of the fundamental harmonic oscillator eigenstate @xmath35 .",
    "this length depends on the atomic mass by @xmath36 and , as an example , is equal to 11 nm for a calcium ion with @xmath37 mhz .",
    "the lamb - dicke condition @xmath31 can also be expressed by @xmath38 .",
    "the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath39 quantifies the ability for a system \\{ion+trap } to reach the lamb - dicke regime for a given transition .",
    "it is of the order of 0.1 for optical transitions ( _ e.g. _ 0.095 for calcium s clock transition in the trap taken as example ) .    in most cases ,",
    "the frequency of motion in the trap is of the order of 1 mhz , whereas the atomic dipole transition used for laser cooling has a width @xmath40 close to @xmath41 mhz . on such broad transition ( @xmath42 )",
    "the doppler limit for laser cooling can be approximated by the one of a free atom @xcite .",
    "this leads to a thermal population of the harmonic trap vibrational levels characterized by @xmath43 .",
    "the lamb - dicke condition @xmath44 is then fulfilled by the vibrational state reached by doppler cooling ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this fulfillment sets the transition free of first order doppler effect , while the second order doppler effect is very small ( see section [ s - doppler2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore the residual distribution of occupied vibrational levels still allows to drive coherent dynamics on the clock transition , as required for the interrogation schemes and confirmed numerically in the following .",
    "since the time needed to reach the doppler cooling limit is of the order of milliseconds while the optical pumping is faster than the millisecond , we can estimate @xmath15 to 5 ms .",
    "the duration required for the detection stage depends on the fluorescence signal collected on the strong dipole transition . for such transitions with a width of @xmath46 20 mhz",
    ", one can expect at least 10@xmath47 counts per second ( cps ) over a stray light level of less than 100 cps . in these conditions ,",
    "10 ms - periods are sufficient to acquire enough signal to decide if the atom has been excited into the metastable state . as a consequence , 15",
    "ms is a realistic estimation for the sum of the preparation and detection contributions to the cycle duration . to this minimum cycle duration",
    "must be added the excitation duration time @xmath16 . in the following subsection",
    ", we theoretically study the minimization of this probe time for different excitation schemes , assuming that the total cycle time @xmath48 ms .",
    "the width @xmath49 of the observed transition and its signal to noise ratio depends on the laser excitation scheme .",
    "the choice of a high - frequency clock transition ( in the optical domain ) allows to reach smaller allan deviations than the ones obtained on frequency standards in the microwave domain . until now",
    ", the narrowest optical transition linewidth has been observed on a hg@xmath3 ion @xcite and has allowed to reach a relative frequency stability of @xmath50 over 1 s averaging . in this article , we discuss possible excitation schemes independently of the ion implied .",
    "we introduce a reduced allan deviation @xmath51 to quantify the expected frequency stability of the standard , keeping in mind that reduced allan deviations between 1 and 10 have already been measured by several groups on lasers locked on atomic optical transitions .",
    "let @xmath52 be the probability for the ion to be in the metastable state once excited by the clock laser .",
    "the frequency of the transition , to which the clock laser will be locked , is deduced from the probability @xmath52 measured several times on the low and high frequency sides of the transition .",
    "this method of frequency discrimination requires the excitation probability @xmath52 to be around 0.5 , where the slope of the probability distribution is the steepest and the frequency sensitivity is the highest .",
    "several sources of noise can limit the signal to noise ratio . among these",
    "is the quantum projection noise @xcite which is dominant once the technical noise has been reduced .",
    "the laser excitation creates a linear superposition of the ground ( @xmath53 ) and metastable ( @xmath54 ) states : @xmath55 . during the detection stage ,",
    "the atomic state is projected on one of these two atomic states .",
    "the variance of such a measurement is @xmath56 and causes a minimum noise @xmath57 on the transition probability .",
    "this can be overcome by using squeezed states @xcite , which we do not consider here .",
    "the maximum signal to noise ratio which can then be observed is @xmath58 which is maximum at resonance ( @xmath59 ) , where the frequency descrimination is unefficient .",
    "thus , maximum frequency sensitivity and maximum signal to noise ratio are not compatible .",
    "additionally , the finite upper - state lifetime leads to spontaneous decay which , for long excitation time , can reduce the maximum excitation probability . as a consequence , finding a compromise between all these incompatible requirements deserve precise studies of the excitation scheme .",
    "two excitation schemes have been experimentally tested by several groups : a single rabi pulse or two temporally separated ramsey pulses .",
    "the first one has been performed on hg@xmath3 @xcite , in@xmath3 @xcite , sr@xmath3 and yb@xmath3@xcite , and the second one on hg@xmath3 @xcite and sr@xmath3 @xcite . in the following",
    "we discuss the principal features of each method and then compare them . to quantify the relative stability allowed by the discussed methods , we evaluate the reduced allan deviation by @xmath60    for a high frequency sensitivity",
    ", we assume that the laser probes the transition on each side of the line , on the two frequencies corresponding to an excitation probability @xmath52 which is half of the maximum probability measured for zero detuning ( @xmath52 can never exceed 1/2 ) .",
    "the deduced @xmath49 when these probabilities are equal is then the fwhm of the experimental linewidth .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix of the two levels @xmath61 and @xmath62 is computed numerically .",
    "the atomic system is defined by the metastable lifetime @xmath63 fixed to 1 second ( @xmath64 ) , and it is driven by a rabi pulsation @xmath65 .",
    "the motion of the ion is taken into account by a distribution of thermal vibrational levels , characterised by the mean vibration number @xmath32 and defined by @xmath66 .",
    "the excitation probability @xmath52 is then an incoherent weighted sum of the probability for each vibrational level to be excited in the metastable state . for a given laser intensity ,",
    "the rabi pulsation from vibrational level @xmath67 is proportional to @xmath68 whereas it is proportional to @xmath69 for a @xmath70 transition .",
    "we choose for @xmath71 the value of 0.095 calculated for a calcium ion in the trap described above .",
    "as the doppler cooling leads to @xmath72 , the excitation probability on the @xmath67 band is higher than the @xmath73 bands so these last ones were neglected . if @xmath65 is the rabi pulsation for the @xmath74 transition , @xmath75 is the one for the @xmath76 transition , @xmath77 being the laguerre polynomial @xcite .",
    "the linewidth @xmath78 of the laser spectrum ( fwhm ) is taken into account by adding a source of decoherence equal to this width in the operator controlling the evolution of the density matrix @xcite . for a laser detuning @xmath79 and in the rotating wave approximation the density matrix evolves according to @xmath80      to avoid power broadening , the narrow transition can be experimentally observed if the rabi pulsation @xmath65 is smaller than the linewidth and the interrogation time longer than the lifetime .",
    "but because of the finite lifetime of the excited state , the maximum excitation probability is low and requires several seconds to be reached , reducing the relative stability even if the observed linewidth is close to the natural width . in an ideal context where the experiment is not limited by the laser stability ,",
    "the calculations show that the smallest reduced allan variance is reached with a single pulse which should last at least 1 s and drive the transition with @xmath65 of the order of @xmath81 . with today s laser stability a cycle time of a few secondes for a single measure",
    "seems not realistic .",
    "we rather consider excitation schemes with durations inferior to 1 second , since a cycle has to be repeated several times before a signal can be built up to counteract on the frequency of the local oscillator .     *",

    "these curves reflect rabi oscillations , which show maximum excitation probability for @xmath92 ( @xmath93 integer ) . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the excitation probability is minimum on resonance and shows some maximum for other detunings .",
    "the computed fwhm has then no physical significance , which is not relevant here as a clock is never operated with this excitation duration .",
    "the interesting feature is the minimum of the reduced allan variance observable for the shortest @xmath16 .",
    "two cases with different rabi pulsation @xmath65 ( @xmath95 and @xmath90 ) are compared in figure [ fig_rabi ] . for both cases ,",
    "excitation probability and full width at half maximum are computed for an ion whose oscillatory motion corresponds to the doppler cooling limit ( @xmath87 ) or to the fundamental vibrational state ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the first result to mention is that the first minima of the reduced allan variance are identical for these two vibrational states , for the chosen rabi pulsation .",
    "it confirms that doppler cooling is sufficient for state preparation .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig_rabi ] suggest that the discrepancy between the @xmath87 and the @xmath86 vibrational state increases with the pulse duration .",
    "we have checked that in the case of the short pulses we consider in the following , the results are nearly the same for these two vibrational distributions and thus , from now on , only the cases concerning @xmath86 are dealt with .    to illustrate the influence of the strength of the rabi pulsation in figure [ fig_rabi ] , the excitation is driven by @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in the first case , the minimum reduced allan deviation is close to 1 but requires an excitation of more than 300 ms . in the second case",
    ", the first minimum is reached for a cycle duration of 50 ms , but this shortening of the cycle duration is paid by an increase of @xmath98 equal to 4.5 .",
    "this trend is general and a further increase of the rabi pulsation leads to an increase of the minimum allan deviation as well as a decrease of the required cycle time .",
    "we now take into account the effect of a finite laser linewidth on the minimum reduced allan deviation and compare the value computed for a laser as broad as the atomic transition ( @xmath99 hz ) to the one computed with a 20 hz broad laser ( fwhm ) . in this latter case ,",
    "the performances of the clock are greatly reduced first by the reduction of the excitation probability and second by the broadening of the observed transition .",
    "the first drawback can be overcome by the increase of the rabi pulsation but this is paid by a further increase of the transition broadening . as a consequence , for a given laser linewidth and a given metastable lifetime",
    ", there is an optimal rabi pulsation which results in a minimum reduced allan deviation .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig_rabi_broad ] where for @xmath100 hz , @xmath98 is minimum ( @xmath98=12.4 ) for @xmath101 and a cycle time of 40 ms , whereas for @xmath99 hz , @xmath98 is minimum for @xmath102 and is then equal to 1.7 but for a cycle time of 625 ms . in the case of the broadest laser linewidth , these results confirm the intuitive idea that for optimum stability , the pulse length @xmath16 is limited by the laser linewidth @xmath103 and that the rabi pulsation is then approximately set by the resonant @xmath104-pulse condition @xmath105 . when the laser linewidth is comparable to the transition natural width ( @xmath106 s@xmath107 ) , the optimum stability is reached for a shorter excitation time @xmath108 and a rabi pulsation under the resonant @xmath104-pulse condition @xmath109 , which could not be dedeuced from the intuitive concept .     required to reach this minimum versus the rabi pulsation .",
    "computation done for a metastable lifetime @xmath83 s and a single rabi pulse by a laser of width @xmath78 ( fwhm ) , with an ion in the vibrational ground state ( @xmath110 ) . broken line : @xmath99 hz and solid line : @xmath100 hz . [ fig_rabi_broad ] ]      the introduction of the separated fields method or ramsey interferometry @xcite",
    "was soon followed by breakthroughs in high resolution spectroscopy and is expected to overcome the limitations met with single pulse excitation . with this method",
    "the line profile is recorded after two pulses of duration @xmath111 such as @xmath112 , separated by a free evolution time @xmath113 .",
    "when the laser detuning is scanned , the profile shows ramsey fringes resulting from an interference pattern and for short enough pulse duration ( or a high enough rabi pulsation ) , the width of the central fringe is equal to @xmath114 and is then independent from the rabi pulsation . for a chosen pulsation @xmath65 , the evolution of @xmath52 , @xmath115 and @xmath98 does not show oscillations with @xmath14 , like for a single rabi pulse .",
    "@xmath98 takes very high values for short @xmath14 and decreases toward a limit for longer @xmath14 .",
    "this limit depends on the choice of the pulsation @xmath65 .    when the width of the laser is taken into account by the relaxation it causes on the coherence , for a given rabi pulsation , the reduced allan deviation decreases for increasing free evolution time until it reaches critical time where the width of the laser broadens the line .",
    "this behaviour results in a minimum of the reduced allan deviation reached for this critical cycle time and depending on the laser linewidth and the rabi pulsation . for increasing rabi pulsation",
    "@xmath65 , this minimum allan deviation decreases towards a limit which depends very few on the laser linewidth as it varies by less than a factor of 2 over the whole range of the considered linewidth ( @xmath116 hz ) .",
    "this is made possible by the short interaction time with the laser , allowed by a strong rabi pulsation @xmath65 . in the case",
    "where the experiment is not limited by the available laser power , @xmath65 must be chosen to reach a minimum allan deviation close to the limit but also to cause a negligeable light - shift on the atomic levels .",
    "this light - shift is evaluated in section [ ac ] and our calculations and numerical computations show that a rabi pulsation @xmath117 s@xmath107 allows to reach the allan deviation limit to better than 1% and to cause a negligeable light - shift .",

    "these values are very close to each - other but their evolution with the width of the laser is very different in the two cases .",
