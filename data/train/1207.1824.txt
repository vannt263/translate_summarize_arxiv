    "we consider the following problem of two - coloring the @xmath3-dimensional lattice @xmath4 .",
    "the _ sensitivity _ of a point in a two - coloring of @xmath4 is the number of differently - colored neighbors of that point , and the sensitivity of the coloring is the maximum sensitivity of all points on the lattice .",
    "we say that a coloring is _ non - trivial _ if the origin is colored red and there is at least one blue point on each axis .",
    "the conjecture is that for any non - trivial coloring , the number of dimensions is always at most some polynomial of the sensitivity .",
    "while this problem is of mathematical interest in itself , aaronson showed that it implies the sensitivity conjecture .",
    "the sensitivity conjecture was first posed in 1994 by nisan and szegedy .",
    "the _ sensitivity _ of a boolean function is the number of bits in the input that , when flipped individually , change the output of the function .",
    "the _ block sensitivity _ is analogous , except that it is the largest number of disjoint subsets of bits such that flipping all the bits in a subset changes the output .",
    "the sensitivity conjecture states that the sensitivity and block sensitivity of a boolean function are _ polynomially related_each is at most a polynomial function of the other .",
    "in other words , the conjecture is that the separation between sensitivity and block sensitivity can not be too large .",
    "nisan and szegedy further conjectured that block sensitivity is at most a quadratic function of sensitivity , and the largest separation known to date is quadratic .",
    "the best known upper bound on the separation , however , is exponential .",
    "the block sensitivity of a function @xmath0 is known to be polynomially related to other important measures in computer science , such as the decision - tree complexity , certificate complexity , polynomial degree , and quantum oracle complexity of @xmath0 .",
    "nisan @xcite originally introduced block sensitivity to find the time needed to compute a boolean function on a parallel random access machine ( pram ) , and used block sensitivity to show that the pram complexity is polynomially related to the decision tree complexity . the sensitivity conjecture ,",
    "if true , would imply that the natural notion of sensitivity is related to this plethora of other measures , and would make it easier to show that new measures are polynomially related to block sensitivity .    in section 2 , we set up aaronson s lattice variant as well as the sensitivity conjecture , and summarize previous progress . in section 3",
    ", we construct a non - trivial coloring with a quadratic separation between the sensitivity and the number of dimensions , the largest known . in section 4 , we extend aaronson s reduction of the sensitivity conjecture to the lattice variant by providing a reduction in the other direction , mapping every coloring to a boolean function . in section 5 ,",
    "we use the reverse reduction to establish the first non - constant lower bound on the sensitivity of non - trivial colorings in terms of the _ min - width _ of the coloring . finally in section 6",
    ", we show that our coloring from section 3 achieves the optimal separation for the class of _ repeated _ colorings , and describe a result by palvolgyi that the coloring is optimal for all _ sliced _ colorings .",
    "consider a two - coloring of the @xmath3-dimensional lattice @xmath4 , which is the set of all points @xmath7 in @xmath3 dimensions such that @xmath7 has all integer coordinates .",
    "every point on the lattice is colored either red or blue .",
    "a two - coloring @xmath8 of a @xmath3-dimensional lattice satisfies the _ non - triviality condition _ if the origin is colored red and there exists at least one blue point on each of the @xmath3 axes .",
    "we call such a coloring a _ non - trivial coloring_.    for ease of notation , a non - trivial coloring is assumed to be in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "neighbor _ of a point @xmath7 in a coloring be a point @xmath9 also on the lattice such that @xmath10 .",
    "in other words , the neighbors of @xmath7 are the points which are 1 away from @xmath7 in a direction along an axis .",
    "the _ sensitivity of a point @xmath7 _ in a coloring @xmath8 , denoted @xmath11 , is the number of neighbors of @xmath7 which are colored differently from @xmath7 .",
    "the _ sensitivity of a coloring @xmath8 _ , denoted @xmath5 , is the maximum of @xmath11 over all @xmath7 .",
    "the non - triviality condition guarantees that for colorings @xmath8 with @xmath12 , there are an infinite number of red and blue points .",
    "this is because for any red point with sensitivity less than @xmath3 , there must be another red point in one of the positive @xmath13 directions , so one can move arbitrarily far away from the origin .",
    "the same holds for blue points .",
    "( aaronson @xcite ) there exist constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that for all non - trivial colorings @xmath8 , @xmath16    we now present a slightly modified version of the sensitivity of a coloring , which we show is almost equivalent to the original definition .",
    "the _ axis - sensitivity _ of a point @xmath7 in a coloring @xmath8 , denoted @xmath17 , is the number of axes from @xmath7 along which there lies a differently - colored neighbor .",

    "furthermore , we show that any non - trivial coloring with @xmath20 can be transformed into a non - trivial coloring @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "consider the coloring @xmath21 constructed by replacing each point in the coloring @xmath8 with a hypercube of @xmath23 points all having the same color .",
    "so every point @xmath24 is replaced with the points of the form @xmath25 , where for all @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in this case for all points @xmath7 , @xmath28 , since there is at most one neighbor along each axis from @xmath7 .",
