    "tracking down the nature of dark matter could be described as the astronomical obsession of the twentieth century .",
    "the concept emerged through oort s comparison of the census of luminous material ( stars , gas , dust ) in the solar neighbourhood with dynamical estimates of the local mass density derived from the motions of k giants , high in the galactic disk ( oort , 1932 ) . like",
    "zwicky s ( 1933 ) near - contemporary suggestion that cluster - galaxy kinematics required dark mass on much larger scales , the problem of the local ` missing mass ' was not taken up immediately .",
    "however , the discrepancy in mass densities , a factor of @xmath1 , prompted a flurry of survey activity in the 1960s and 70s , largely centred on what proved to be substantial overestimates of the number density of m dwarfs ( see reid & hawley , 2000 , ch .",
    "debate continues over the significance of the oort limit discrepancy ( bahcall _ et al . _ , 1992 ; crz _ et al . _ , 1998 ) .    in a cosmological context ,",
    "dark matter came to prominence with the realisation that rotation curves of many galaxies were not keplerian at radii beyond the visible extent of the disk ( e.g. rubin , ford & thonnard , 1978 ) .",
    "some were flat , implying that the enclosed mass increases linearly with radius ( ostriker , peebles & yahil , 1974 ) .",
    "extrapolating to the holmberg radius , the total mass approaches @xmath2 , with mass - to - light ratios more than an order of magnitude higher than expected for an old stellar population .",
    "_ suggested that the additional material could be distributed in a near - spherical structure ( a ` heavy halo ' ) , thereby dynamically stabilising the disk in spiral galaxies ( ostriker & peebles , 1973 ) .",
    "the implied radial density law is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the distance from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this is substantially flatter than the @xmath5 density distribution of the @xmath6 traditional ( population ii ) stellar halo ( schmidt , 1975 ) .",
    "subsequent developments in the field have been reviewed by trimble ( 1987 ) , fich & tremaine ( 1991 ) and ashman ( 1992 ) .",
    "the most recent estimates , based on satellite galaxy motions , place the mass of the milky way at @xmath7 for @xmath8 kpc .",
    "( wilkinson & evans , 1999 ) .",
    "approximately 10% of this mass can be accounted for by stars , gas and dust in the galactic disk and the stellar halo ( alcock _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "dark matter candidates for the remaining 90% include exotic particles , cold molecular gas , and compact objects , ranging from 10@xmath9 black holes through brown dwarfs to space rocks . of these categories",
    ", the last is potentially most accessible to direct astronomical observation through gravitational microlensing ( paczynski , 1986 )",
    ". a number of extended photometric monitoring campaigns have been conducted , directed towards the high star - density regions of the lmc , smc and the galactic bulge , and a substantial number of lensing events detected .",
    "the contribution made by machos to the dark halo is still uncertain . from their most recent analysis of data taken in the central regions of the lmc ,",
    "the macho group have detected 17 - 19 events , from which they estimate the contribution of machos to dark matter to be about 20% , @xmath10 ( alcock et al .",
    "on the other hand , data from the eros group cover a wider region of the lmc , within which they have detected at most 2 events . based on those detections",
    ", they estimate that machos contribute between 0 and 20% of the heavy halo ( lassere et al .",
    "while the exact locations of the lenses remain controversial , mainly because the simple microlensing light curve is inadequate to provide information on the lens locations , there are two binary events  macho 98-smc-1 and macho lmc-9  for which the lens locations have been determined with reasonable certainty ( albrow et al .",
    "1999 , alcock et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) . in both these cases",
    ", the caustic crossing timescales suggest that the lenses are most likely in the magellanic clouds , and this has been used to argue that most of the lenses may be magellanic cloud members ( e.g. graff , 2000 ; sahu and sahu , 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , the very different time scales of the events observed towards the lmc and the smc seem to be inconsistent with machos located in the halo ( sahu , 1994 ; 2001 ) .    whether machos are galactic or members of the magellanic clouds , it is clear that they are a minority constituent of the heavy halo .",
    "moreover , the best estimate of the mass of the foreground lensing objects , based on the distribution of event timescales and the assumed kinematics , proves to be surprisingly high , @xmath11 . indeed , probably the most significant result from the microlensing projects is the stringent limit set on possible dark matter contributions from lower - mass objects such as brown dwarfs .",
    "the set of compact astronomical objects with @xmath12 , and luminosities sufficiently low to escape detection , is small ; white dwarfs are the obvious candidate , presumably fossil remnants of a primordial stellar population ( population iii ) .",
    "such an hypothesis has significant implications , particularly for star formation theory : the corresponding mass function , @xmath13 , must peak strongly at intermediate masses , avoiding over - enrichment of population ii by supernovae , and matching the number of long - lived low - mass dwarfs to the stringent constraints set by general starcounts ( graff & freese , 1996 ; reid _ et al . _ , 1996 ) . while there is only weak evidence for radical changes in @xmath13 in the abundance range spanned by disk and halo ,",
    "a number of theoretical models have been devised which accomodate those requirements at primordial abundances ( chabrier _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; chabrier , 1999 ) .",
    "even those models , however , produce sufficient ejecta that they have difficulty matching the observed abundance ratios of light elements in population ii stars ( gibson & mould , 1998 ; fields _ et al . _ , 2000 ) .    accepting these caveats ,",
    "it is possible to search for the white dwarf members of the purported population iii heavy halo using their unusual colours .",
    "recent theoretical models ( bergeron _ et al . _ , 1995 ; hansen , 1999 ) predict that old , cool , hydrogen - atmosphere white dwarfs have flux distributions which depart significantly from blackbody curves , due mainly to h@xmath14 absorption ( mould & liebert , 1978 ) .",
    "a small number of examples have been found in the field ( e.g. lhs 3250 , harris _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) , although none have the low luminosities ( m@xmath15 ) expected for 12 - 14 gyr - old degenerates .",
    "such objects might have escaped attention in previous large - scale surveys .    almost contemporaneously with the theoretical work , analysis by ibata _",
    "( 1999 ) of second - epoch images of the hubble deep field , taken two years after the first - epoch data , led to the tentative identification of two to five very faint , blue , point - like sources which appeared to exhibit measureable proper motion .",
    "if those sources were heavy - halo white dwarfs , the mass density would be sufficient to account for all of the heavy - halo dark matter .",
    "however , the proper motions have recently been withdrawn based on third epoch hst observations , taken three years after the second - epoch observations ( richer , 2001 ) .",
    "the local mass density of the heavy halo is @xmath16 ( for an @xmath17 mass dependence ) .",
    "if 0.5@xmath18 objects contribute 20% of the dark halo , the solar neighbourhood density is 0.004 machos pc@xmath19 .",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) identify two nearby cool white dwarfs , which they suggest are potential examples of this type of object .",
    "( 2001 ) , however , failed to identify any likely counterparts amongst published proper motion surveys , while monet _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) identified only a single candidate halo white dwarf in a proper motion survey combining accepted and rejected poss ii plate material in 35 fields ( @xmath20 square degrees ) .",
    "although the latter object is spectral type dc , the spectrophotometric properties are consistent with a cooling - age significantly younger than 12 gyrs , making it likely to be a member of the stellar halo .",
    "finally , harris _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) report the detection of an extremely cool white dwarf , sdssp j133739.40 + 000142.8 , from sdss commissioning data .",
    "however , the system has a low space motion , and is probably a low - mass disk star with a helium core .",
    "most recently , oppenheimer _",
    "( 2001 ; o2001 ) have completed a deep proper - motion survey towards the south galactic cap and have identified 38 cool white dwarfs . based on kinematics",
    ", they assign those stars to a halo - like population , and argue that most are members of the heavy halo . if confirmed , this would be a result of considerable significance .",
    "however , we argue that the o2001 analysis fails to meet the burden of proof required for such a radical hypothesis .",
    "we present an alternative scenario , explaining the observations in terms of conventional stellar populations . in the following section we discuss the oppenheimer _",
    "observations in the broader context of stellar population kinematics ; the final section summarises our conclusions .",
    "oppenheimer _ et al.s_ sample is drawn from 196 schmidt fields , covering 4165 square degrees towards the south galactic cap .",
    "they derive bri magnitudes and proper motions for their sample by combining measurements of iiiaj , iiiaf and ivn plate material from the uk / aao schmidt .",
    "the ( b - r ) colours are used to estimate photometric parallaxes from a linear colour - magnitude relation , with uncertainties of @xmath21 .",
    "radial velocities have not been measured for any of the white dwarfs ; indeed , most have featureless dc - type spectra . however , towards the galactic poles , transverse motion depends most strongly on the u and v velocity components , motion towards the galactic centre and in the direction of galactic rotation respectively .",
    "thus , while the available data do not permit a reliable estimate of w , the velocity perpendicular to the galactic plane , planar ( u , v ) velocities can be estimated from the astrometric data .",
    "oppenheimer _ et al .",
    "_ derive u and v velocities for each target , allowing for solar motion ( _ via _ secular parallax ) , and setting w=0 kms@xmath22 for each star . systems with @xmath23 fall outwith the limits of a velocity ellipsoid defined by the 2@xmath24 motions of disk stars ( from chiba & beers , 2000 ; cb ) , and are identified as having halo - like kinematics . using the @xmath25 method , and limiting the sample to r@xmath26 , they derive a density of @xmath27 this is a factor of ten higher than the expected density of white dwarfs in the stellar halo , and oppenheimer _ et al . _",
    "argue that these degenerates are local representatives of dark matter in the milky way s heavy halo .",
    "we note that the faintest white dwarf is wd0351 - 564 , with m@xmath28 , almost 1 magnitude brighter than predicted for 12 - 14 gyr - old degenerates ( hansen , 1999 ) .",
    "we have computed motions for the o2001 dataset using a slightly different assumption ; we adopt the o2001 photometric distance estimate ( and associated uncertainty ) and proper motion measurements , but set v@xmath29 kms@xmath22 rather than setting w=0 kms@xmath22 .",
    "since we have no information on either w or v@xmath30 , both assumptions are equally valid . moreover , if the o2001 interpretation of these results is correct , it should be sufficiently robust to survive either assumption .",
    "we note that the mean w velocity for the sample under our assumption is @xmath31 kms@xmath22 , giving no indication of our having introduced a significant bias .",
    "we also allow for the solar motion , adopting u@xmath32=10.0 kms@xmath22 , v@xmath32=5.3 kms@xmath22 and w@xmath32=7.2 kms@xmath22 , from dehnen & binney s ( 1998 ) analysis of hipparcos data .",
    "figure 1 plots the resulting ( u , v ) distribution , where we also show cb - disk 1@xmath24 and 2@xmath24 ellipsoids used by o2001 , and those appropriate to a non - rotating halo population with dispersion 120 kms@xmath22 . the most striking feature , in both figure 1 and oppenheimer _ et al.s_ figure 3 , is the concentration of stars near the boundaries of the cb - disk 2@xmath24 ellipsoid .",
    "moreover , there is a significant excess of prograde rotators , 34 of 38 stars in our figure 1 , 30 of 38 in figure 3 of o2001 .",
    "this is exactly the behaviour expected if a sizeable fraction of the stars are drawn from the high - velocity tail of a rotating population , rather than a non - rotating , pressure - supported halo .",
    "oppenheimer _ et al .",
    "_ argue that the observed distribution is skewed by difficulties in detecting white dwarfs with high proper motions .",
    "in particular , they note that the probability of detecting stars with @xmath33 arcsec yr@xmath22 is less than 10% .",
    "such objects , however , should make only a limited contribution to this survey , since with an average distance of 73 parsecs , @xmath34 arcsec yr@xmath22 corresponds to a transverse motion of 1040 kms@xmath22 .",
    "this is a factor of two higher than the highest velocity plotted in figure 1 , and , indeed , exceeds the local escape velocity .",
    "we can assess completeness at lower motions by plotting the cumulative distribution of proper motions . in a proper - motion limited rgime ,",
    "one expects the number of stars @xmath35 to vary with @xmath36 .",
    "figure 2 shows that the o2001 halo candidates are broadly consistent with that distribution .",
    "stars at 73 parsecs with mildly retrograde orbits ( v@xmath37 between 200 and 350 kms@xmath22 ) have @xmath38 .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that significant numbers of missing high-@xmath39 stars could account for the scarcity of white dwarfs with retrograde motion .",
    "is there an alternative explanation of the nature of these stars ?",
    "as noted above , the concentration at high rotational velocities clearly suggests an origin in the disk .",
    "indeed , oppenheimer _ et al s _ choice of 2@xmath24 velocity ellipsoids to differentiate disk and halo should lead to significant contamination - 2@xmath24 selection applied to two uncorrelated parameters excludes only 86% of a sample .",
    "in fact , disk contamination does not reach that level since chiba & beers kinematics are derived from a sample of metal - poor disk dwarfs ( @xmath40 \\rangle \\approx -0.6 $ ] ) , and are therefore characteristic of an older , higher velocity - dispersion sub - population . assessing the likely proportion of high - velocity disk white dwarfs demands kinematics for a volume - limited sample of disk stars ; local m dwarfs can supply that demand .",
    "reid , hawley & gizis ( 1995 ; rhg ) have used spectroscopy and astrometry of almost 2000 m dwarfs to construct a volume - limited sample of 514 m - dwarf systems with @xmath41 .",
    "all of those stars have space motions determined to an accuracy of 10 - 20 kms@xmath22 in each co - ordinate , allowing analysis of the the kinematics of the local disk",
    ". comparisons with spectroscopic surveys suggest that the data are 95% complete , with the missing stars predominantly at low velocities .",
    "we can use these data to derive an estimate of the parameter @xmath42 , the fraction of stars in an unbiased sample of the galactic disk which have velocities exceeding the cd - disk 2@xmath24 ellipsoid .",
    "the overall velocity distributions are matched poorly by the single gaussian velocity dispersions implicit in the schwarzschild ellipsoid model , particularly the rotational component , v , where there is evidence for multiple components ( rhg , figure 11 ) .",
    "the distributions in u and w are simpler ; the main body of data can be represented as the sum of two distinct gaussian components , with dispersions of @xmath43=[35 , 52 ] and @xmath44=[20 , 32 ] kms@xmath22 respectively . even in this model",
    ", there are indications of departures from gaussian distributions at high velocities - the rgime sampled by o2001 .",
    "rhg suggested that 15 - 20% of local stars might reside in the higher velocity - dispersion component , but more detailed analysis shows that the latter stars comprise no more than 12% of the total .",
    "allowing for incompleteness at low velocities , the likely ratio of low-@xmath24:high-@xmath24 stars is @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the high - velocity component has a local density comparable to that inferred for the ` thick disk ' in recent star - count analyses ( ohja _ et al . _ , 1999 ; siegel _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep . ) .",
    "the origins of that component , originally identified by gilmore & reid ( 1983 ) , remain a subject of debate , but , since velocity dispersion is a function of age ( wielen , 1977 ) , the thick disk is likely to include the oldest stars in the galactic disk .    given the complex kinematics shown by the m - dwarf sample , we do not attempt to model the ( u , v ) velocity distribution . instead , we conduct a simple empirical comparison .",
    "figure 3 plots ( u , v ) data for the rhg m - dwarf sample .",
    "twenty systems lie beyond the 2@xmath24 cb - disk contours , and would be classed as candidate halo stars by oppenheimer _",
    "_ if we assume 95% completeness in the rhg sample , this corresponds to a fractional contribution of @xmath46% .",
    "this fraction exceeds the expected frequency of subdwarfs in the solar neighbourhood , @xmath47 .",
    "since the stars plotted in figure 3 are m dwarfs , we can check whether the high - velocity objects have metallicities are consistent with halo membership .",
    "population ii stars have [ fe / h]@xmath48 - 1 ; members of a population iii heavy halo should be significantly more metal - poor , with near - primordial abundances .",
    "m subdwarfs are recogniseable in having weaker tio absorption than solar - abundance disk dwarfs with the same cah absorption ( gizis , 1997 ) , but all of the outliers in figure 3 have near - solar cah / tio bandstrength ratios ( figure 4 ) .",
    "thus , the high - velocity m dwarfs are members of a disk population , probably the thick disk",
    ". it would be surprising if these main - sequence stars were to lack degenerate counterparts , and as the oldest disk stars , the cooling times can be sufficiently long to achieve temperatures of less than 3000k , similar halo white dwarfs .",
    "we have argued that the morphological similarities between figures 1 and 3 indicate that a sizeable fraction of the o2001 white dwarf sample are members of the galactic disk .",
    "those similarities are emphasised in figure 5 , where we superimpose the two distributions .",
    "at least half of the o2001 white dwarfs are aligned in u with the m - dwarf distribution ( at 7 oclock and 11 oclock , relative to the centre of the disk ellipsoid ) .    in order to estimate the likely number of high - velocity white dwarfs contributed by the disk",
    ", we need to estimate the density of the parent population , comprising not only white dwarfs , but also their main - sequence progenitors . the latter are included in the calculation since @xmath42 gives the fraction of high - velocity stars within a particular mass range , summed over all ages .",
    "we assume that all stars , regardless of mass , undergo the same statistical dynamical evolution over the history of the galactic disk .",
    "white dwarfs are the older members of the subset of stars with masses in the range @xmath49 to 8 m@xmath32 , just as chromospherically inactive dm dwarfs are the older members of the @xmath50 to 0.5 m@xmath32 stars plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the main - sequence progenitors need to be included in the intermediate - mass analysis , just as dme dwarfs are included in the sample plotted in figure 2 .",
    "thus , the expected density of high - velocity disk white dwarfs is given by @xmath51    the simplest method of making this calculation is to use statistics for nearby stars .",
    "twelve white dwarfs within 8 parsecs are currently known : seven single stars , two wide companions of low - mass red dwarfs ( 40 eri b and stein 2051b ) , two companions of massive stars ( sirius and procyon ) and one unresolved companion of an m - dwarf ( g203 - 47b ; see reid & hawley , 2000 ) . excluding the binaries , the local number density is @xmath52 where the cited uncertainty reflects only poisson statistics . in comparison , liebert _ et al . _",
    "( 1988 ) derive @xmath53 from analysis of white dwarfs found in proper motion surveys .",
    "a recent study by mendez & ruiz ( 2001 ) , based on a more extensive sample , gives @xmath54 both are broadly consistent with the density estimate derived from the nearest stars .",
    "the 8-parsec sample includes ten main - sequence stars ( including sirius and procyon ) with masses exceeding 1 m@xmath32 and main - sequence lifetimes less than 10 gyrs , giving an effective local number density of @xmath55 applying the appropriate correction factor of @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 again , the uncertainty reflects counting statistics .",
    "white dwarfs in the stellar halo are also expected in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "assuming that the initial mass function , @xmath13 , is similar to that of the disk , as suggested by observations of globular clusters ( piotto & zoccali , 1999 ) , then these stars contribute an additional @xmath58 stars pc@xmath19 ( gould _ et al . _ , 1998 ) .",
    "thus , based on the properties of the known stellar populations in the solar neighbourhood , we expect a total density of high - velocity white dwarfs of @xmath59 this is entirely consistent with @xmath60 , the space density of high - velocity white dwarfs derived by oppenheimer _",
    "_ for their sample of 38 cool white dwarfs .",
    "these calculations can be taken a step further .",
    "while the majority of the white dwarfs in figure 1 can be accomodated in the galactic disk , a minority have substantial heliocentric velocities and are more likely to originate in a pressure - supported halo population . in a non - rotating system",
    "we expect equal numbers of prograde and retrograde rotators , so we can use the number of retrograde - rotating white dwarfs to estimate the local density of that population .",
    "we measure v@xmath61 kms@xmath22 for four white dwarfs : f351 - 50 , lhs 147 , wd0135 - 039 and wd0300 - 044 .",
    "all four are brighter than the r59f=19.7 completeness limit cited by oppenheimer _",
    "et al . _ for their survey .",
    "summing @xmath62 , allowing for 10% sky coverage , gives a density of @xmath63 stars pc@xmath22 .",
    "doubling that value to take prograde rotators into account gives @xmath64 if we adopt the o2001 prescription for deriving ( u , v ) , four additional white dwarfs have retrograde motion : wd0153 - 014 , lhs 542 , wd0351 - 564 and lp586 - 51 .",
    "including the contribution of the three stars which satisfy the completeness limit ( wd0351 - 564 has r59f=19.72 ) increases the derived density by less than 40% giving @xmath65 either value is consistent with that expected for white dwarfs in the population ii halo ( gould _ et al . _ , 1998 ) .    in summary ,",
    "high - velocity disk stars can account for @xmath66 of the white dwarfs discovered by oppenheimer _",
    "the remaining stars , particularly the retrograde rotators , are explained as members of the classical halo .",
    "given these results , we do not believe it necessary to invoke any contribution from hypothetical white dwarf members of a dark - matter , heavy halo .    despite our disagreement over the interpretation of these results ,",
    "it is clear that the stars discovered in oppenheimer _",
    "et al.s_ south galactic cap survey represent a significant addition to the catalogue of cool white dwarfs .",
    "besides providing further insight on cooling processes during the final stages of evolution of degenerate dwarfs , statistical analysis of the sample can provide important information on the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , if we are correct in our conjecture that the bulk of these stars are members of the thick disk , then their luminosity function can be used to probe the age of that sub - population , calibrating the first epoch of star formation within the galactic disk .",
    "the authors thank ben oppenheimer for providing additional data for the white dwarfs .",
    "we also thank neal dalal and geza gyuk for their comments , notably pointing out the difference between one - dimensional and two - dimensional statistics ."
