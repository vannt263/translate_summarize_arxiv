    "<S> in this work we present a formalism to describe non equilibrium conditions in systems with a discretized energy spectrum , such as quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a formalism based on a combination of gibbs - shannon entropy and information thermodynamics that arrives to a generalization of the de - brujin identity applicable to discrete and non - symmetric distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to define the concept of a thermodynamic temperature with a different , albeit complementary meaning to the equilibrium kinetic temperature of a system . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applied to bosonic and fermionic cases represented by an harmonic oscillator and a single energy state , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the formalism correctly recovers known results at equilibrium , then we demonstrate an application to a genuine non equilibrium state : a coherent quantum oscillator .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : :    may be entered using the ` \\pacs{#1 } ` command .    </S>",
    "<S> non equilibrium thermodynamics is intimately linked to the concept of non - equilibrium temperature which in turn tights to the concept of non - equilibrium entropy . </S>",
    "<S> several attempts have been made in the past in order to provide a consistent definition of all these concepts @xcite and the field is still reach of fruitful debates . </S>",
    "<S> one of such attempts can be called informational thermodynamics , resting on the extension of the gibbs - shannon entropy to non - equilibrium conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this encounters the difficulty of assigning probabilities to microstates which is solved , for instance , using the debated postulate of maximal entropy or maximal entropy production rate . </S>",
    "<S> however , for many non - equilibrium systems , maximal entropy principle fails , signifying that fast evolving dynamics prevent any meaningful definition of such probabilities . nonetheless , in non - equilibrium systems under steady - state conditions </S>",
    "<S> the concept of a probability distribution is meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> such systems are characterized by steady - state fluxes of energy , mass or charges driven by non - equilibrium distributions of phase - space degrees of freedom . to this class </S>",
    "<S> belong a broad range of interesting physical systems ranging from electronic devices , electrochemical cells , catalytic systems , photochemical steady state reactions . </S>",
    "<S> especially brought under attention by the advent of nanotechnology are extremely miniaturized devices comprising a small number of atoms or molecules , usually kept under strong non - equilibrium steady - state conditions . </S>",
    "<S> many examples can be easily found in the literature , such as nano - mosfets or , at the extreme , molecular electronic devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many assumptions widely used in the simulation of macroscopic or mesoscopic scales often assume local quasi - equilibrium , with a well defined local electrochemical potential controlling state occupancy and densities and a local equilibrium temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approximation fails when the perturbation can not be considered small with respect to the characteristic length scale . on the other hand , in a non - equilibrium theory </S>",
    "<S> , it would be useful to retain as much as possible those concepts that have provided so deep insights in systems close to equilibrium , such as the concept of temperature , that can be viewed as a parameter controlling thermodynamics heat fluxes .    </S>",
    "<S> a central quantity in statistical mechanics is the shannon - gibbs classical entropy , defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath2 the probability of the system to occupy the @xmath3 microstate of the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the microstate can be expressed in terms of generalized coordinates representing the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the system . under gibbs definition </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 is a special way of measuring the phase - space available to the system . </S>",
    "<S> we note that equation ( [ ent1 ] ) is well - defined when the integration is actually interpreted as a dense sum .    in information theory ( shannon entropy ) , the state @xmath3 represents a set of symbols ( word ) emitted by an information source and @xmath5 . despite this formal identity , </S>",
    "<S> the connection between thermodynamics and information theory is not obvious but it has been established @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theorems and formalisms derived in the context of information theory can be readapted to statistical mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> entropy and average energy , @xmath6 = @xmath7 , define two concepts of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic temperature is defined as @xmath8 and it is related to the statistics in the phase space . the kinetic temperature , on the other hand , is connected to the energy stored in the dynamical dofs . in equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> it is directly connected to the equipartition theorem , giving for a classical gas of @xmath9 particles , @xmath10    finally , for systems in contact with a bath , it is possible to define the temperature of the external environment reservoir , @xmath11 .    under equilibrium conditions @xmath12 = @xmath11 = @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> for systems under non - equilibrium these three temperatures assume different values with different meaning . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a formalism that extends thermodynamics and temperature to non equilibrium conditions , at least under steady state , making extensive use of informational theory concepts . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is first introduced and applied to an ensemble of quantum harmonic oscillators following bosonic statistics ( bs ) and a single state ensemble following fermi statistics ( fs ) , for which the equilibrium probability distributions ( pd ) are well known . </S>",
    "<S> then , we consider the non - equilibrium distribution represented by the coherent states of a bosonic oscillator , for which we demonstrate that the thermodynamic , kinetik and bath temperatures departs from each others with different meanings @xcite .    before moving forward </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the quantum extension of ( [ ent1 ] ) is the von neuman entropy based on the density matrix ( dm ) , @xmath14 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the theory we discuss here is valid for systems in a mixed state with diagonal dm , reducing the von neuman entropy to a classical sum over the probability distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> an incoherent ensamble of harmonic oscillators in equilibrium follow the geometric distribution , @xmath15 similarly , we can define the equilibrium occupation probability of a single energy state following fermi statistics , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . from these expressions of @xmath18 , we can easily verify that in equilibrium in both cases @xmath19 .    in a recent work </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have made an extensive discussion concerning the generalization of entropy for system under steady - state non equilibrium conditions . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , the dof of a system driven out of equilibrium correlate to external variables , @xmath20 . as an example we can think of an external field that induces fluxes of particles or energy , inducing correlations between particle motions . </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium form of the energy spectrum and the pd will also be different from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the from of the gibbs - shannon entropy still applicable , non equilibrium ( ne ) entropy is actually a conditional entropy , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the equilibrium entropy and the last term is the mutual information @xcite , @xmath23 equation ( [ eq1 ] ) shows that a system out of equilibrium can be mapped into a system in equilibrium with additional information @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same equation also implies a reduction of the available phase space , associated with a reduction of entropy and increase of available free energy , according to : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average non - equilibrium energy ( depending on the ne pd ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now our attention to discrete pds , @xmath18 , defined on a generally finite support , @xmath26 $ ] , that may represent a discrete energy spectrum . for discrete distributions </S>",
    "<S> the integrals of equations ( [ ent1 ] ) and ( [ mutual ] ) become summation over the index @xmath27 . in order to evaluate ( [ thermo ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we need to construct a functional perturbation to the pd , @xmath18 , that induces an infinitesimal increase of entropy , @xmath28 , and mean energy , @xmath29 . in making such a mathematical construction </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the energies of the microstates , @xmath30 , are left unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with taking the derivative of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ thermo ] ) at constant volume and particle number . in a way that resembles the original de brujin scheme for continuous pd </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a perturbation obtained as a discrete convolution @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is generally defined in the interval @xmath33 as @xcite , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> however the perturbation needs to be modified at the two boundaries such that for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the perturbed pd , @xmath46 , is @xmath47 the modifications at the boundaries are just needed for preserving the normalization of the pd to unity . for a fermi statistics the perturbed probability reduces to @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the original de brujin identity is demonstrated for continuous pds defined on a infinite support . in this contex @xmath50 </S>",

    "<S> leads to the well - known de brujin identity @xcite , usually derived in the context of continuous and differentiable pds . </S>",
    "<S> in such a context @xmath13 is also known as the fisher temperature of the system . </S>",

    "<S> the generality of _ theorem 1 _ makes it valid to any arbitrary pd , including non equilibrium conditions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , no specific assumptions have been made . in the case of distributions defined on semi - infinite supports , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath64 , the form ( [ p2 ] ) need to be corrected only at the lowest boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> an obvious sanity check is to show that under an equilibrium pd the relationship ( [ temp123 ] ) leads to the correct equilibrium temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this can be shown for the bose - einstein and fermi statistics using the detailed - balance relationships , @xmath65 . substituting in eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ temp123 ] ) , @xmath67 , therefore @xmath68 . a similar proof can also be carried out for the equilibrium fermionic pd of eq . ( [ p0f ] ) .    under non equilibrium conditions the three temperatures ( @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 ) are generally different . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic temperature is in fact obtained from @xmath25 alone , while the thermodynamic temperature is related to the statistics of the pd . </S>",
    "<S> the meaning of these temperatures is still debated but could be generally linked to the heat and mechanical work exchanged between reservoir and system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> limited to the assumption of langivin dynamics , sanistrava and coworkers demonstrate the relationships , @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , the net heat and mechanical work exchanged . </S>",
    "<S> a positive sign corresponds to a system absorbing energy ( heat or work ) from the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant result of the relations above is that @xmath13 and @xmath12 could be used to understand fluxes of work and heat in non - equilibrium systems , simply based on the non - equilibrium pd .    </S>",

    "<S> this shows that the intuitive concept of temperature is related to @xmath12 , whereas @xmath13 measures in fact something quite different , related to the statistics of the pd . for a laser field , even if the average energy is increasing with @xmath82 , the disorder associated with the distribution decreases and with it the thermodynamic temperature . as shown in figure [ fig : entropy ] , the non - equilibrium entropy is strictly lower than the entropy in equilibrium , as expected from the relationships ( [ eq1]-[fne ] ) , for the same average energy or average occupation , @xmath83 . </S>",
