    "the silk fibroin is a protein extracted from cocoons of _ bombyx mori _ silkworm .",
    "it has been widely used in biomedical applications due to its high capacity to suture tissues , to regenerate bones and its biocompatibility with several types of human cells used in prosthesis  @xcite . in the last years",
    ", researchers have proposed to improve the nanoscale features of silk fibroin by adding glycerol  @xcite .",
    "though the presence of glycerol can provide better material properties , it also can alter the silk fibroin molecules interactions , damaging the result in its surface .",
    "therefore , texture analysis methods emerge as a powerful tool for determining the suitable concentration of glycerol .    many methods for texture description have been proposed in the literature .",
    "these methods are based on _ statistical analysis _ of the spatial distribution ( e.g. , co - occurrence matrices  @xcite , local binary pattern  @xcite and entropy  @xcite ) , _ stochastic models _",
    "( e.g. , markov random fields  @xcite ) , _ spectral analysis _ ( e.g. , fourier descriptors  @xcite , gabor filters  @xcite and wavelets transform  @xcite ) , _ complexity analysis _ ( e.g. , fractal dimension  @xcite ) , _ agent - based model _ ( e.g. , deterministic tourist walk  @xcite ) .",
    "although there are effective texture methods , they do not capture the richness of patterns of the silk fibroin scaffolds .    in this paper",
    ", we present a methodology for classifying surface properties of silk fibroin by means of texture analysis .",
    "the texture description approach proposed here is based on the artificial crawler model  @xcite .",
    "we propose a new rule of movement that not only moves artificial crawler agents toward higher intensity , as well as to lower ones .",
    "we confirm that this strategy increases the discriminatory power and outperforms the state - of - the - art method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : acrawler ] details the original artificial crawler model .",
    "section [ sec : approach ] presents our approach to characterize textured images .",
    "section [ sec : exps ] discusses the results of the experiments .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the first artificial crawler ( acrawler ) model was developed in @xcite .",
    "let us consider that an image is a pair @xmath0 , consisting of a finite set @xmath1 of pixels , and a mapping @xmath2 that assigns to each pixel @xmath3 an intensity @xmath4 ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "a pixel of the intensity map @xmath2 holds a neighborhood set @xmath7 of pixels @xmath8 , which @xmath9 is the euclidean distance between pixels @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "thereby , we assume the eight - connected neighbors .",
    "the original artificial crawler model assumes that each agent lives on one pixel of the image . at each time @xmath11 ,",
    "an agent @xmath12 is characterized by two attributes : ( 1 ) @xmath13 holds a level of energy and ( 2 ) @xmath14 occupies a spatial position in the image .",
    "first , @xmath15 agents are born with identical energy @xmath16 .",
    "such energy can either wax or wane their lifespan according to energy consumption and influence of the environment . on images ,",
    "the environment is treated as a 3d surface with different altitudes that correspond to grey values in z - axis of the images .",
    "higher intensities supply nutrients to the agents , while lower altitudes correspond to the land .",
    "figure [ pic : environment ] shows a textured image and the peaks and valleys where the agents can live .",
    "the algorithm consists of a set of rules that comprises the evolution process :    1 .   *",
    "born * : each agent @xmath12 is born with the same energy @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 2 .   * survival threshold * : an agent @xmath12 dies if its energy is below the threshold .",
    "@xmath18 3 .",
    "* movement * : @xmath19 + @xmath20 + @xmath21 agents settle down if the grey level of its 8-neighbors are lower than itself .",
    "+ @xmath22 agents move to a specific pixel if there exist one of its 8-neighbors ( @xmath23 ) with higher intensity + @xmath24 if there exist more than one neighbor with higher intensity , an agent moves to the pixel that already was occupied ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "* energy consumption * : each time @xmath11 consumes one unity of energy .",
    "@xmath26 5 .",
    "* law of the jungle * : an agent with higher energy eats up another with lower one .",
    "@xmath27 6 .",
    "* gain of energy * : it up to dates the energy absorption from the environment , where @xmath28 is a rate of absorption over the pixel @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 7 .",
    "* limit of energy * : it bounds the maximum energy @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32    agents that were born in lower altitudes areas can die in the evolution process , while individuals that reached to settle down in areas of higher altitudes have higher likelihood to remain alive . to quantify the multi - agent system ,",
    "a curve of live agents at each time is obtained :    @xmath33\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the number of live agents at time @xmath11 and @xmath35 is maximum iteration .",
    "the artificial crawler model described above consists of moving agents to a neighbor pixel with the highest intensity . despite the promising results , this idea does not extract all the richness of textural pattern .",
    "our approach differs from the original acrawler model in terms of movement : each agent is not only able to move to the higher altitudes as well as to lower ones .",
    "it allows the model to extract the details present in peaks and valleys of the images .",
    "first , the agents move to higher intensities as the original artificial crawler method .",
    "thus , the artificial crawlers are performed using this rule and the curve @xmath36 is obtained . throughout the paper ,",
    "this rule of movement will be referred as @xmath37 .",
    "we can observe that the original artificial crawler method only models the peaks of a textured image . to obtain a robust and effective texture representation ,",
    "we propose to move artificial crawlers toward lower intensities @xmath38 this rule of movement will be referred throughout the paper as to @xmath39 . in our approach , artificial crawlers",
    "are randomly placed in the image with initial energy @xmath16 .",
    "then , the movement step is modified as follows :    @xmath19    @xmath40 + @xmath21 agents settle down if the grey level of its 8-neighbors are higher than itself .",
    "+ @xmath22 agents move to a specific pixel if there exist one of its 8-neighbors ( @xmath41 ) with lower intensity + @xmath24 if there exist more than one neighbor with lower intensity , an agent moves to the pixel that already was occupied ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the multi - agent systems using the rule of movement @xmath39 is characterized as the original method by using the number of live agents at each time .",
    "considering that now we have two rules of movement , the final feature vector of our approach is composed by the concatenation of @xmath36 and @xmath42 according to : @xmath43 \\label{eq : finalvector}\\ ] ]    figure [ pic : curve1 ] shows the curves of the evolution process .",
    "we took two classes of textures ( on the top right - hand corner in figure [ pic : curve1 ] ) from the album the brodatz @xcite to illustrate the separability . on the left , figure [ pic : curve1 ]",
    "shows the number of live agents using the rule of movement @xmath39 , while the curve for the rule of movement @xmath37 is shown on the right of figure [ pic : curve1 ] .",
    "the experimental results below corroborate the importance of both rules of movement in the texture modeling .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .",
    "we first outline details of the experimental setup , and then , experiments carried out on two datasets are discussed : brodatz and silk fibroin . here",
    "is described the whole process for image acquisition of silk fibroin scaffolds .",
    "besides , we show comparative results with different texture methods .",
    "the proposed method was first evaluated over texture classification experiments by using images extracted from brodatz album @xcite .",
    "this album is considered a well - known benchmark for evaluating texture recognition methods . each class",
    "is composed by one image divided into nine sub - images non - overlapped .",
    "a total of 440 images grouped into 40 classes was considered .",
    "each image has @xmath44 of size and 256 grey levels .",
    "one example of each class is shown in figure [ pic : brodatz ] .",
    "example of 40 brodatz texture classes used in the experiment .",
    "each image has @xmath44 pixels and 256 gray levels.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the texture classification was carried out for ten - fold cross validation to avoid bias . at each round",
    ", we randomly divide the samples of each class into ten subsets of the same size , i.e. , nine for training and the remaining for testing .",
    "the results are reported as the average value over the ten runs . for classification",
    ", we adopted the model linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) .",
    "the underlying idea is to maximize the euclidian distance between the means of the classes , while minimizing the within - class variance . for further information",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) @xcite was selected since it is well founded in statistical learning theory and has been successfully applied to various object detection tasks in computer vision .",
    "lda , originally proposed by fisher , computes a linear transformation @xmath45 of @xmath46 , which @xmath47 is a matrix and @xmath48 denotes the number of features and @xmath15 number of samples .",
    "we optimized two parameters of the artificial crawler model : the number of agents and the way that agents move in the evolution process .",
    "the number of agents placed on the pixels of the image was inital set to @xmath49 with a coverage rate of @xmath50 , varying from @xmath49 to @xmath51 . in our experiments ,",
    "all agent was born with an initial energy @xmath16 of 10 units and the loss for each iteration consumes 1 unit of energy . the absorption rate was set to @xmath52 in terms of the current pixel . for the survival threshold and the upper bound of energy",
    "were set to @xmath53 and @xmath54 units , respectively .",
    "* experiment 1 : * first , we perform an analysis of our method on the brodatz dataset .",
    "figure [ pic : ccr - vc - numberagents](a ) presents the correct classification rate versus the number of iterations .",
    "the results for the original artificial crawler is shown as curve @xmath37 while the results for our method is shown as curve @xmath55 . for a complete comparison",
    ", we also provide the results for an method which agents move to pixels with lower intensity @xmath38 curve @xmath39 . as can be seen , the proposed method provided the highest correct classification rates for all values of iterations .",
    "these experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves performance over the traditional methods .",
    "we can also observe that the rule @xmath39 provided higher rates than the rule @xmath37 , given the idea that valleys are more discriminative than peaks in the brodatz dataset .",
    "another important parameter of the artificial crawler methods is the number of agents .",
    "figure [ pic : ccr - vc - numberagents](b ) shows the correct classification rates versus the number of agents . as in the previous experiment ,",
    "our method achieved the highest rates compared to the other two strategies .",
    "again , the rule @xmath39 provided higher rates than the rule @xmath37 .",
    "another important observation from figure [ pic : ccr - vc - numberagents](b ) is that using a few agents , the methods achieved good classification results , which makes the artificial crawler methods suitable for real time applications . using these two plots",
    ", we can determine the best parameters of our method to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the results of the proposed method are compared with existing texture analysis methods in table [ tab : comparisonbrodatz ] .",
    "it is observed that the our method outperforms the state - of - the - art .",
    "the highest classification rate of @xmath58 was obtained by our method , which is followed by a classification rate of @xmath59 obtained by the gabor filter , one of the most traditional texture analysis method .",

    "in this paper we presented a novel approach based on artificial crawler for texture classification .",
    "we have demonstrated how the feature vector can be improved by combining _ min _ and _ max _ curves , instead of using only the strategy for the maximum of intensity of the pixels .",
    "although traditional methods of texture analysis have provided satisfactory results , the approach proposed here has proved to be superior for characterizing textures .",
    "we have tested our proposal on the most popular benchmark for texture analysis and find that it produces good classification results . furthermore , we tested our approach on the silk fibroin scaffolds analysis and results indicate that our method is consistent and can be applied in real - world applications .",
    "the results support the idea that our approach can be used as a feasible step for many analysis not only applications on tissue engineering .",
    "in addition , our results can be improved by studying the setting of our method .",
