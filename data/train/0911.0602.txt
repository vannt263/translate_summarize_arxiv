    "in a wide range of plasma processes operating in laboratories or astrophysical phenomena , interactions between relativistic particles and electromagnetic fields play vital roles .",
    "for instance , recent laser experiments revealed that a high intensity laser can accelerate particles to ultra - relativistic speed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "non - thermal components found in spectra of active astrophysical objects , e.g. , supernova remnants , gamma - ray bursts , and jets from active galactic nuclei , are interpreted as synchrotron radiation emitted by charged , relativistic particles gyrating about magnetic field lines .",
    "there are two approaches in order to model such plasmas .",
    "one is the fluid approach based on the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics(rmhd ) and the other is the kinetic approach based on the boltzmann equation coupled with the maxwell equations . because the fluid approach implicitly assumes that the distribution of particles in the momentum space is the maxwell - jttner distribution , which is the relativistic extension of the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution , the kinetic approach is indispensable for dealing with the momentum distribution deviating from the thermal equilibrium .",
    "especially , dilute plasmas in which collisions between particles composing the plasmas are absent , often called collisionless plasmas , are known to be modeled by the so - called vlasov - maxwell system @xcite .    at present , the most reliable and reasonable method to simulate dynamical behaviors of collisionless plasmas is the particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which calculates the orbits of charged particles by solving the equation of motion and the configuration of electromagnetic fields by solving the maxwell equations . in this method , the momentum distribution of plasmas is approximated by an ensemble of the momentum of each particle placed in the physical space . although the number of particles in virtual plasmas produced by a pic simulation is much smaller than that in real plasmas , it is known that behaviors of plasmas are well reproduced by the method",
    ". nevertheless , we can not avoid significant numerical noises due to the shortage of particles when we focus on the high momentum tail of the distribution function of plasma particles .    on the other hand , the direct numerical integration of the vlasov - maxwell system ( referred to as `` vlasov simulation '' ) , which discretizes the momentum space as well as the physical space , does not suffer from such noises .",
    "therefore , some methods to perform the vlasov simulation have been developed @xcite .",
    "while vlasov simulations require higher computational performance than pic simulations do , recent developments of computational technology allow us to study plasma processes by using vlasov simulations .",
    "for example , @xcite presented a scheme to numerically integrate the 2d3v vlasov - maxwell system ( the term `` 2d3v '' means the two dimensional space associated with the three dimensional velocity space ) and demonstrated that the scheme could simulate the weibel instability with high accuracy .",
    "@xcite provided a scheme for the integration of the electrostatic 1d2v vlasov - poisson system in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "they adopted the polar coordinates in the velocity space , which allows them to perform simulations with a good energy conservation .",
    "the scheme presented by @xcite integrates the vlasov - maxwell system in the hybrid approximation , i.e. , they solve the 2d3v electromagnetic vlasov equation for ions and fluid equations for electrons , based on the current advance method introduced by @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated non - linear behavior of the weibel instability in detail by using a scheme similar to that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a series of simulations for the magnetic reconnection and confirmed that their results are consistent with those of some pic simulations .",
    "however , the attempts stated above treated only non - relativistic plasmas .",
    "investigations into the numerical integration of the relativistic vlasov - maxwell system are still rare .",
    "although @xcite presented a scheme for the 1d2v relativistic vlasov - maxwell system , they assumed that particles have no dispersion in the transverse momentum space .",
    "furthermore , there exists another problem that the mass and energy conservations are not always guaranteed unlike pic simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new conservative scheme for the numerical integration of the 1d2v relativistic vlasov - maxwell system that allows particles to have dispersions in the momentum space .",
    "the scheme is based on the semi - lagrangian approach , which is extensively used to solve the vlasov - maxwell system @xcite . in sec .",

    "[ 5:conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we present a scheme for the numerical integration of the 1d2v relativistic vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "we consider a plasma whose spatial distribution varies along one direction , which implies that only two components of the momenta of particles , the longitudinal and the lateral components , need to be calculated .",
    "thus , the 1d2v vlasov equation for species @xmath0 describes the kinetic evolution of the distribution function @xmath1 ( @xmath2 for electrons and @xmath3 for ions ) in the phase space @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the coordinate in the physical space , @xmath6 is the corresponding coordinate in the momentum space , and @xmath7 is the coordinate labeling the lateral momentum . in this case , the relativistic vlasov equation takes the following form , @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the lorentz factor . the constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the mass and the charge of a species @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath12 is the speed of light .",
    "the electric field appearing here has two components parallel @xmath13 and normal @xmath14 to the @xmath5-axis , while the magnetic field has only one component @xmath15 normal to the @xmath5-axis . here",
    "the normal component of the electric field points to the direction of the lateral momentum and the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other .",
    "thus , they are expressed as vector forms @xmath16 and @xmath17 when the momentum vector is expressed as @xmath18 .",
    "their time evolutions are governed by the maxwell equations , @xmath19 where the electric current densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 are expressed in terms of @xmath1 as @xmath22      for the numerical integration of the equations introduced above , we define the characteristic value for each physical quantity : @xmath23 as the time scale , @xmath24 as the length scale , @xmath25 as the momentum , @xmath26 as the electromagnetic field , and @xmath27 as the electric current density . here",
    "@xmath28 is the electron plasma frequency defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the elementary charge and @xmath31 is the number density . normalizing physical variables with these quantities and using the same notations for normalized quantities ,",
    "one can obtain the dimensionless vlasov equation , @xmath32\\frac{\\partial f^s}{\\partial p } + r_q^s\\left[e^\\perp-\\frac{p}{\\gamma^s}b^\\perp\\right]\\frac{\\partial f^s}{\\partial q}=0 , \\label{5:vlasov}\\ ] ] where the lorentz factor is modified to @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are dimensionless constants defined by @xmath36 respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the maxwell equations lead to the following dimensionless form , @xmath37 where the dimensionless electric current densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 are expressed in terms of @xmath1 as @xmath38 these two relations close the system .      for convenience of the following sections , we transform equation ( [ 5:vlasov ] ) into the conservative form and equation ( [ 5:maxwell ] ) into the advection form .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ 5:vlasov ] ) by @xmath39 and some algebraic manipulations lead to the following equation , @xmath40 the l.h.s of this equation represents the advection of the rest and kinetic energy of particles along the characteristics of the vlasov equation ( [ 5:vlasov ] ) , while the r.h.s is interpreted as the exchange of energy between particles and electromagnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , introducing the following variables , @xmath41 one can rewrite the maxwell equations for the perpendicular components @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath42 in the following , we integrate the above equations instead of the equations for the components @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in this section , we describe a method for numerical integration of the dimensionless vlasov - maxwell system ( [ 5:vlasov])-([5:energy ] ) introduced in the previous section .",
    "first , we divide the phase space with the range of @xmath43\\times[p_\\mathrm{min},p_\\mathrm{max}]\\times[q_\\mathrm{min},q_\\mathrm{max}]$ ] into @xmath44 small cells each of which has the volume @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are @xmath49 the center of a cell labeled by integers @xmath50 is located at @xmath51 , where @xmath52 next , we define the number of particles of a species @xmath0 in the cell at time @xmath53 as , @xmath54 and the energy of particles contained in the cell at @xmath53 ; @xmath55 on the other hand , we discretize electromagnetic fields by defining them only at the positions @xmath56 , @xmath57      applying the operator splitting method , equation ( [ 5:energy ] ) is numerically integrated by two steps .",
    "one is the step for the advection of particles and electromagnetic fields and the other is the step for the exchange of energy between particles and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the vlasov equation ( [ 5:vlasov ] ) is an advection equation with no source term , while the energy equation ( [ 5:energy ] ) contains advection terms and a source term .",
    "we split the energy equation ( [ 5:energy ] ) into the two parts as follows , @xmath58 one can see that the advection part of the energy equation ( [ 5:energya ] ) takes the same form as the vlasov equation ( [ 5:vlasov ] ) . therefore , we introduce an operator @xmath59 $ ] that evolves the variables @xmath60 or @xmath61 by a time interval @xmath62 according to equations ( [ 5:vlasov ] ) or ( [ 5:energya ] ) for given @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) . for the interaction part , we introduce another operator @xmath68 $ ] that evolves the variable @xmath61 by a time interval @xmath62 according to equation ( [ 5:energyb ] ) with given @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "we present a method to calculate the time evolution of the quantities defined by equations ( [ 5:number])-([5:field ] ) . as is the case for the energy equation ,",
    "the maxwell equations contain advection terms and source terms .",
    "thus , we split them into the two parts as follows , @xmath69 here we introduce two operators that evolve the variables @xmath70 and @xmath71 by a time interval @xmath62 according to equations ( [ 5:maxwella ] ) as @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] . in addition , for the interaction part , we introduce three operators that evolve the variables @xmath74 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 by a time interval @xmath62 according to equation ( [ 5:maxwellb ] ) as @xmath75 $ ] , @xmath76 $ ] , and @xmath77 $ ]",

    "[ 5:interpolation ] .      for the integration of the advection part ,",
    "we make use of the characteristics of the vlasov equation ( [ 5:vlasov ] ) , @xmath79 which are equivalent to the equation of motion of a relativistic charged particle , because there exists a reliable scheme for the integration of these equations widely used in pic simulations @xcite , the buneman - boris method .    at first , using the buneman - boris method , we obtain the orbit of a particle located at the center of each cell @xmath80 at time @xmath53 .",
    "we thus calculate the coordinates @xmath81 of the particle at @xmath82 as @xmath83 we then assume that the other particles in the same cell move with the same velocity as the particle having been located at the center , which should be a good approximation for a sufficiently small cell .",
    "the relation between the size of the cell and the accuracy of the above treatment is discussed in  3.7 and examined in  4.1 .",
    "the intuitive explanation for the scheme is shown in figure [ figure1 ] . in each panel",
    ", the horizontal axis represents the @xmath5-axis and the vertical axis represents the @xmath6- and @xmath7-axes . although we draw the phase space as two dimensional , actual calculations are performed in the three dimensional phase space @xmath4 .",
    "the procedure to calculate the number of particles in the cell ( cell 5 ) located at the center of the surrounding nine cells at @xmath82 is as follows ; ( 1 ) calculate the orbit of a particle located at the center of each cell ( the left panel ) using the buneman - boris method .",
    "( 2 ) count the number of particles entering the original position of cell 5 under the assumption for a uniform distribution of particles inside each cell . in other words",
    ", the number of particles in cell 5 at @xmath82 is defined as that of particles located in the gray zones in the right panel of figure [ figure1 ] .",

    "we evolve the energy contained in a cell @xmath86 in the same way . in this method ,",
    "the number ( or the mass ) and the kinetic energy of particles are conserved for each step .",
    "the advection part of the maxwell equations ( [ 5:maxwella ] ) consists of two linear advection equations with a constant velocity that have exact solutions in the form of @xmath87 therefore , assuming @xmath88 , one finds that the relations @xmath89 hold .",
    "we use these relations for the integration of the advection part of the maxwell equation . because this method is based on the exact solution of a linear advection equation , no numerical diffusion occurs .",
    "as we noted in section [ 5:splitting ] , the electric current density needs to be evaluated for integration of the interaction part . in the following ,",
    "we discuss a method to evaluate the electric current density .",
    "the key ingredient for the method is interpolation of the distribution function @xmath1 .",
    "we know the number @xmath60 of particles and the energy @xmath61 contained in each cell . from the definition of the two variables , the distribution function @xmath1 must satisfy equations ( [ 5:number ] ) and ( [ 5:ene ] ) for given @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , we have two constraints .",
    "so the interpolation function , which is defined as @xmath90 , generally have the form with two unknown coefficients , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a function and the coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94 are determined from the constraints ( [ 5:number ] ) and ( [ 5:ene ] ) . here , to determine the form of the function @xmath92 , we consider the meaning of the constraints . the constraints , ( [ 5:number ] ) and ( [ 5:ene ] ) , are the zero - order and the first - order moment of the lorentz factor .",
    "then , we assume the interpolation function @xmath90 to take the form of @xmath95 we should note that there are many other candidates for the form of the interpolation function .",
    "if we calculate time evolutions of other macroscopic variable for each cell , e.g. , momenta of particles , second - order moment of the lorentz factor , and so on , or use the number @xmath96 and the energy @xmath97 of particles in neighboring cells , we can construct an interpolation function including more correction terms , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a function corresponding to the additional macroscopic variable .",
    "in this study , we use the interpolation function ( [ 5:f_cell ] ) , which is a linear function of the energy of particles , to reduce the computational cost .",
    "substitution of the interpolation function ( [ 5:f_cell ] ) into the constraints and some algebraic manipulations lead to @xmath100},\\\\ b_{ijk}&=&\\frac{e^s_{ijk}(t)-\\langle\\gamma^s\\rangle_{jk } n^s_{ijk}(t ) } { \\delta x\\delta p\\delta q[\\langle(\\gamma^s)^2\\rangle_{jk}-\\langle\\gamma^s\\rangle_{jk}^2]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bracket represents the following integral , @xmath101 appendix [ appendixd ] gives the expressions of the variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus the distribution function @xmath104 takes a uniform value in each spatial cell @xmath105 . using this interpolation function , the electric current densities due to a particle species @xmath0 are evaluated as @xmath106 in non - dimensional forms",
    "however , the thus constructed function @xmath104 is not guaranteed to take positive values at all points in the region @xmath107\\times[q_k-\\delta",
    "q/2,q_k+\\delta q/2]$ ] for each @xmath105 .",
    "because the distribution function of real plasmas must be positive at any point in the phase space , the interpolation is modified if @xmath104 takes a negative value .",
    "we use the following simple expressions for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 instead of the expressions ( [ 5:int_current ] ) in cells with negative @xmath90 .",
    "one can evaluate the electric current density by summing up these variables as @xmath111      in this subsection , we propose a method to integrate the interaction part with respect to time .",
    "this method conserves the sum of the kinetic energy of particles and the electromagnetic energy",
    ".    equations ( [ 5:maxwellb ] ) are discretized as @xmath112 where the electric current densities are evaluated beforehand according to the procedure described in the previous subsection .",
    "these equations give expressions for the operators @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . on the other hand , to obtain the energy @xmath86 of particles in a cell evolved by the interaction part of the energy equation ( [ 5:energyb ] ) , equation ( [ 5:energyb ] ) is integrated with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath116 which means that the total energy of particles in a cell is changed by interactions between particles and electric fields .",
    "discretizing this equation , we then propose the following scheme for the integration : @xmath117 which gives an expression for the operator @xmath118 .    in the following",
    ", we will show that this procedure conserves the total energy .",
    "summing up the above equation with respect to @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath0 , and then substituting the relations ( [ 5:relj ] ) and ( [ egh ] ) into the result , one obtains @xmath121j^\\parallel_i(t)\\delta t\\label{5:energy1}\\\\ & & + \\left[g_i(t)+h_i(t)-\\frac{j^\\perp_i(t)}{2}\\delta t\\right]j^\\perp_i(t)\\delta t,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents the change of kinetic energy of particles after a time step in this scheme .",
    "the change of the electromagnetic energy is obtained by summing the square of each of ( [ egh ] ) , @xmath122 ^ 2}{2}+[g_i(t+\\delta t)]^2+[h_i(t+\\delta t)]^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{2em}= \\frac{[e^\\parallel_i(t)]^2}{2}+[g_i(t)]^2+[h_i(t)]^2 -\\left[e^\\parallel_i(t)-\\frac{j^\\parallel_i(t)}{2}\\delta t\\right]j^\\parallel_i(t)\\delta t\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{4em } -\\left[g_i(t)+h_i(t)-\\frac{j^\\perp_i(t)}{2}\\delta t\\right]j^\\perp_i(t)\\delta t \\label{5:energy2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by summing up both sides of equations ( [ 5:energy1 ] ) and ( [ 5:energy2 ] ) with respect to @xmath105 , one can easily check that the total energy in a region @xmath123\\times[p_\\mathrm{min},p_\\mathrm{max}]\\times[q_\\mathrm{min},q_\\mathrm{max}]$ ] is conserved : @xmath124 ^ 2}{2}+[g_i(t)]^2+[h_i(t)]^2=\\mathrm{const}.\\ ] ] in other words , the procedures @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath118 expressed by ( [ egh ] ) and ( [ 5:ip ] ) give a conservative scheme for the integration of the interaction part of the relativistic vlasov - maxwell system .      in sections [ 5:splitting ] , [ 5:advection ] , [ 5:interpolation ] , and [ 5:interaction ] , we present procedures that evolve the number and the energy of particles in a cell and electromagnetic fields . in order for the procedures to work ,",
    "the time interval @xmath62 is required to satisfy some conditions .    as we noted in section [ 5:advection ] , the scheme ( [ 5:adv_gh ] ) requires that the time interval @xmath62 must be equal to @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , the scheme for integration of the advection part of the vlasov equation ( [ 5:adv_p ] ) requires that the displacement of a particle by integration of equations ( [ 5:characteristics ] ) along the @xmath5- , @xmath6- , and @xmath7-axes must not exceed the intervals @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . in short , particles must not jump over a cell .",
    "these conditions impose the value of the time interval to satisfy @xmath125 where @xmath126 represents the maximum of the variable @xmath127 for all @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we mention the accuracy of our scheme proposed in this section .",
    "as explained above , our scheme is based on various procedures , such as splitting of equations , the advection part , the interaction part , and the evaluation of the current density , which makes the mathematical proof of the accuracy of our scheme very difficult .",
    "then , we estimate the accuracy of the advection of particles , which is likely to be the most inaccurate compared to the other procedure .    in the procedure solving the advection part of the vlasov equation , all particles in a given cell in the phase space",
    "are assumed to move with the same orbit as that of the particle located at the center of the cell .",
    "however , this treatment obviously involves errors to a certain extent , because particles located at the different position from the center must be integrated under different initial conditions . in particular , the difference is most significant for particles located at the vertex of the cell .",
    "since the difference of the position between particles at the vertex and the center is of the order of @xmath128 , and @xmath48 , the estimated positions of particles at the vertex contain errors of the order of @xmath128 , and @xmath48 , which indicates the number of particles in the cell at the next step contains errors of the order of @xmath128 , and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the procedure solving the advection part of the vlasov equation have first order accuracy in the physical and the momentum spaces .",
    "in this section , we show results of simulations performed by using the scheme proposed in the previous section . for the purpose , we solve three test problems , the gyration of particles , the weibel instability , and the wakefield acceleration .",
    "the gyration of particles is solved to investigate into the accuracy of our scheme . the weibel instability and the wakefield acceleration",
    "are well - known plasma processes and important in both experimental and astrophysical contexts .",
    "we assume that electrons are uniformly distributed in the physical space with a gaussian distribution in the momentum spaces , @xmath129 where @xmath130 represents the dispersion in the momentum spaces , and an uniform magnetic field , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a constant .",
    "one can easily check that the above configuration is a stationary solution of the vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "however , since our scheme suffers from a numerical diffusion as expected in the previous section , the distribution function @xmath133 at @xmath53 must be different slightly from the initial one @xmath134 .",
    "then , we adopt the following value @xmath135 as a measure of the accuracy of our scheme ,",

    "the value @xmath135 is expected to depend strongly on @xmath47 and @xmath48 rather than @xmath46 in this test problem where particles rotate in the momentum space @xmath152 . in other words , the dependence of @xmath135 on @xmath46 have uncertainty because of the insensitiveness .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the dependence derived above must be @xmath153 essentially",
    ". however , this does not mean second order accuracy in the physical space . because of the condition @xmath88 mentioned in  3.6 , when we double the number of zones @xmath143 in the physical space , the time interval @xmath62 must be half of the previous value . therefore , the value @xmath135 scales as @xmath154 , which indicates that our scheme has first order accuracy in time and the physical space . on the other hand , the dashed line shows that the value @xmath135 scales as @xmath47 , which confirms the estimation in  3.7 .      the weibel instability is a kind of plasma instabilities caused by anisotropic momentum distributions of collisionless plasma . the formulation and dispersion relation of the weibel instability operating in a relativistic one - dimensional plasma",
