    "amorphous solids are obtained when a glass - former is cooled below the glass transition @xcite to a state which on the one hand is amorphous , exhibiting liquid like organization of the constituents ( atoms , molecules or polymers ) , and on the other hand is a solid , reacting elastically ( reversibly ) to small strains .",
    "there is a large variety of experimental examples of such glassy systems , and theoretically there are many well studied models @xcite based on point particles with a variety of inter - particle potentials that exhibit stable supercooled liquids phases which then solidify to an amorphous solid when cooled below the glass transition .",
    "typically all these materials , both in the lab and on the computer , exhibit a so - called yield - stress above which the material fails to a plastic flow . in previous research @xcite it was pointed out that depending on the protocol of cooling to the glass state , the plastic response of the system can be either via homogeneous flow or via shear bands .",
    "the former obtains typically when the quenching to the glass state is  fast \" , whereas the latter when the quench is  slow \" . in the latter case when the stress exceeds some yield stress , the sample , rather than flowing homogeneously in a plastic flow , localizes",
    "all the shear in a plane that is at 45 degrees to the compressive stress axis , and then breaks along this plane @xcite .    in recent work",
    "@xcite it was argued that the fundamental instability that gives rise to shear bands is the appearance of highly correlated lines of eshelby quadrupoles ( and see below for precise definition ) which organize the non - affine displacement field of an amorphous solid such that the shear is highly localized along a narrow band .",
    "how this fundamental instability results in macroscopic shear bands , why these appear in 45 degrees to the principal stress axis , and what determines the difference in plastic response between fastly and slowly quenched glasses are all subjects of this paper .",
    "we will also present an ab - initio calculation of the yield stress at which an amorphous solid is expected to response plastically with shear localization .    in sect .",
    "[ plastic ] we review briefly the type of numerical simulations that we do and explain the basic facts about plasticity of amorphous solids . section [ inclusion ] exhibits the fundamental solution of an eshelby quadrupolar plastic event .",
    "this section is not particularly new but is important for our purposes in setting the stage and the notation for the next sect .",
    "[ energy ] in which we compute the energy of @xmath4 such eshelby quadrupoles in the elastic medium .",
    "we show explicitly that as a function of the external strain ( or the resulting stress ) there is a threshold value at which a bifurcation occurs . below this value",
    "only isolated eshelby quadrupoles can appear in the system , leading to localized plastic events . above this threshold",
    "a density of such quadrupoles can appear , and when they do appear they are highly correlated , preferring to organize on a line at 45 degrees to the principal shear direction . in sect .",
    "[ estimate ] we present the analytic estimate of the yield strain , and demonstrate a satisfactory agreement with the numerical simulations . finally , in sect .",
    "[ summary ] we provide a summary of the most important results of the paper and offer a discussion of the road ahead .",
    "as a background to the calculations in this paper we need to briefly review recent progress in understanding plasticity in amorphous solids @xcite . below we deal with 2-dimensional systems composed of @xmath5 point particles in an area @xmath6 , characterized by a total energy @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position of the @xmath9th particle . generalization to 3-dimensional systems is straightforward if somewhat technical .",
    "the fundamental plastic instability is most cleanly described in athermal ( @xmath10 ) and quasi - static ( aqs ) conditions when an amorphous solid is subjected to quasi - static strain , allowing the system to regain mechanical equilibrium after every differential strain increase .",
    "higher temperatures and finite strain rates introduce fluctuations and lack of mechanical equilibrium which cloud the fundamental physics of plastic instabilities with unnecessary details @xcite .    in our aqs numerical simulations we use a @xmath11 binary lennard - jones mixture to simulate the shear localization discussed in this work .",
    "the potential energy for a pair of particles labeled @xmath9 and @xmath12 has the form @xmath13 \\ , \\label{uij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are added to smooth the potential at a scaled cut - off of @xmath17 ( up to the second derivative ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 were chosen to be @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively and @xmath24(see @xcite )",
    ". the particle masses were taken to be equal .",
    "the samples were prepared using high - temperature equilibration followed by a quench to zero temperature ( @xmath25 ) ( see @xcite ) . for shearing ,",
    "the usual athermal - quasistatic shear protocol was followed where each step comprises of an affine shift followed by an non - affine displacement using conjugate gradient minimization .",
    "the simulations were conducted in two dimensions ( 2d ) and employed lees - edwards periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this implies that a square sample of size @xmath26 remains so also after strain .",
    "samples were generated with quench rates ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ( in lj units ) , and were strained to greater than @xmath29 percent .",
    "simulations were performed on system - sizes ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 particles with a fixed density of @xmath32 ( in lj units ) .",
    "the simulations reported in the paper have @xmath33 particles and a quench - rate of @xmath34 ( in lj units ) .",
    "we choose to develop the theory for the case of external simple shear since then the strain tensor is traceless , simplifying some of the theoretical expressions . applying an external shear , one discovers that the response of an amorphous solids to a small increase in the external shear strain @xmath35 ( we drop tensorial indices for simplicity ) is composed of two contributions .",
    "the first is the affine response which simply follows the imposed shear , such that the particles positions @xmath36 change via @xmath37 this affine response results in nonzero forces between the particles ( in an amorphous solid ) and these are relaxed by the non - affine response @xmath38 which returns the system to mechanical equilibrium .",
    "thus in total @xmath39 .",
    "the nonaffine response @xmath38 solves an exact ( and model independent ) differential equation of the form @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the so - called hessian matrix and @xmath42 is known as the non - affine force .",
    "the inverse of the hessian matrix is evaluated after the removal of any goldstone modes ( if they exist ) .",
    "a plastic event occurs when a nonzero eigenvalue @xmath43 of @xmath44 tends to zero at some strain value @xmath45 .",
    "it was proven that this occurs universally via a saddle node bifurcation such that @xmath43 tends to zero like @xmath46 @xcite . for values of the stress which are below the yield stress the plastic instability",
    "is seen @xcite as a localization of the eigenfunction of @xmath44 denoted as @xmath47 which is associated with the eigenvalue @xmath43 , ( see fig .",
    "[ loc ] left panel ) .",
    "while at @xmath48 all the eigenfunctions associated with low - lying eigenvalues are delocalized , @xmath47 localizes as @xmath49 ( when @xmath50 ) on a quadrupolar structure as seen in fig .",
    "[ loc ] left panel for the non - affine displacement field when the plastic instability is approached .",
    "these simple plastic instabilities involve the motion of a relatively small number of particles ( say 20 to 30 particles ) but the stress field that is released has a long tail .",
    "when the strain increases beyond some yield strain , the nature of the plastic instabilities can change in a fundamental way @xcite . the main analytic calculation that is reported in sect .",
    "[ energy ] shows that _ when the stress built in the system is sufficiently large _ , instead of the eigenfunction localizing on a single quadrupolar structure ,",
    "* it can now localize on a series of @xmath4 such structures , which are organized on a line that is at @xmath51 degrees to the principal stress axis , with the quadrupolar structures having a fixed orientation relative to the applied shear*. fig .",
    "[ result ] shows the non - affine field that is identical to the eigenfunction which is associated with this instability , clearly demonstrating the series of quadrupolar structures that are now organizing the flow such as to localize the shear in a narrow strip around them .",
    "this is the fundamental shear banding instability .",
    "note that this instability is reminiscent of some chainlike structure seen in liquid crystals , arising from the orientational elastic energy of the anisotropic host fluid @xcite , and ferromagnetic chains of particles in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the reader should note that the event shown in fig . [ result ]",
    "will move the particles only a tiny amount , and it is the repeated instability where many such event hit at the same region which results in the catastrophic event that is seen as a shear band in experiments .",
    "nevertheless this is the fundamental shear localization instability and in the sequel we will have to understand why repeated instabilities hit again and again in the same region .",
    "we should stress that this is not inevitable , for samples that are prepared by a fast quench these instabilities appear at random places adding up to what seems to be a homogeneous flow .",
    "for further discussion of this point see sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "as said above , the shear localizing instability appears only when the stress exceeds a threshold . to explain why , we turn now to analysis . as a first step we model the quadrupolar stress field which is associated with the simple plastic instability as a circular eshelby inclusion @xcite .      we consider a 2d circular inclusion that has been strained into an ellipse using an eigenstrain or a stress - free strain @xmath52 which we take to be traceless ie @xmath53 @xcite . here and below repeated indices imply a summation in 2-dimensions .",
    "a general expression for such a traceless tensor can be written in terms of a unit vector @xmath54 and a scalar @xmath55 as @xmath56 we also assume that a homogenous strain @xmath57 acts globally ( which in our case also triggers the local transformation of the inclusion ) .",
    "this strained ellipsoidal inclusion both feels a traction exerted by the surrounding elastic medium resulting in a constrained strain @xmath58 in the inclusion , and itself exerts a traction at the inclusion - elastic medium interface resulting in the originally unstrained surroundings developing a constrained strain field @xmath59 . here and below @xmath60 stands for an arbitrary cartesian point in the material which for this purpose is approximated as a continuum .",
    "a fourth - order eshelby tensor @xmath61 can be defined which relates the constrained strain _ in _ the inclusion @xmath58 to the eigenstrain @xmath52 viz .",
    "@xmath62 now for an inclusion of arbitrary shape the constrained strain @xmath58 , stress @xmath63 , and displacement field @xmath64 inside the inclusion are in general functions of space . for ellipsoidal inclusions , however , it was shown by eshelby @xcite that the eshelby tensor and the constrained stress and strain fields _ inside _ the inclusion become independent of space .",
    "we work here with a circular inclusion which is a special case of an ellipse and hence for such an inclusion , the eshelby tensor is @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the poisson s ratio .",
    "note that this is the eshelby tensor for an inclusion in 2-dimensions .",

    "one can either choose the two lame s coefficients or @xmath76 and @xmath66 as the two independent material parameters .",
    "the relations between them are given by @xmath77 these relations are correct in 3-dimensions with plane strain conditions and therefore also in 2-dimensions @xcite .",

    "the reader should note that this is an approximation when there are multiple quadrupoles in the system , since they influence each other and the solution leading to eq .",
    "( [ uc ] ) should be repeated in the presence of many quadrupoles .",

    "the minimum is obtained at @xmath110 , or @xmath111 .",
    "we thus conclude that when the line of correlated quadrupole forms under shear , this line is in 45 degrees to the compressive axis , as is indeed seen in experiments . of",
    "course there are two solutions for this , perpendicular to each other .",
    "note that for other external strains which are not consistent with a traceless strain tensor ( or in 3-dimensions ) this conclusion may change .",
    "the physical meaning of this analytic result is that it is cheaper ( in energy ) for the material to organize @xmath4 quadrupolar structures on a line of 45 degrees with the compressive stress , all having the same orientation , than any other arrangement of these @xmath4 quadrupoles , including any random distribution .",
    "this explains why such a highly correlated distribution appears in the strained amorphous solid , and why it can only appear when the external strain ( or the built - up stress ) are high enough .",
    "this fact , in addition to the observation that such an arrangement of eshelby quadrupoles organizes the displacement field into a localized shear , explains the origin of this fundamental instability .",
    "in this section we turn to estimate the yield stress and the associated density of eshelby quadrupoles . to this aim",

    "we find that the latter exhibit the fundamental shear localization instability again and again along approximately the same line , accumulating displacement that develops into a shear band . on the other hand",
