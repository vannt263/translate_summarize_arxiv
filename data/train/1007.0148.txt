    "the quasi two - dimensional molecular series @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath5 exemplifies the complex interplay of collective phenomena that occur in correlated electron systems@xcite . in particular ,",
    "the proximity of superconducting @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br to a mott transition , along with possible pseudogap physics and molecular disorder effects , has led to this material being extensively studied in recent years@xcite .",
    "despite this intense interest , several experimental observations in this system lack a conclusive explanation @xcite and more experimental study is warranted . in this paper",
    "we present a muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) investigation of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br .",

    "[ picture](a ) .",
    "the bedt - ttf molecules dimerize , forming molecular units which stack on a triangular lattice in two - dimensional planes .",
    "the removal of one electron from each bedt - ttf dimer causes the tight - binding band to be half filled and in order to balance the charge layers of anion , x , are located between the partially oxidized bedt - ttf sheets .",
    "the properties of the system are strongly dependent on the transfer integral @xmath8 which is controlled by the dimer separation and may be manipulated by applying pressure or by changing the identity of the anion@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the family [ fig .",
    "[ picture](b ) ] shows that the system may be tuned from mott insulator through superconductivity into a normal metallic state as a function of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the on - site coulomb repulsion ( which is a property of the dimer and is almost independent of the anion or pressure ) .",
    "importantly , this tuning is achieved without the need for chemical doping ( in contrast to the cuprates ) and therefore minimizes structural disorder effects . at small @xmath9",

    "these may be broadly grouped three temperature regions . in region",
    "i ( @xmath14  k ) there are sharp changes in the temperature dependence of the lattice constants@xcite [ fig .",
    "[ master](d ) ] and , above 70  k , a rapid increase in the thermal expansion coefficient perpendicular to the planes@xcite @xmath15 [ fig .",
    "[ master](e ) ] .",
    "these coincide with a rounded maximum in the resistivity@xcite @xmath16 [ fig .",
    "[ master](b ) ] .",
    "the properties of this region have been linked to a glass - like freezing of terminal ethylene groups on the bedt - ttf molecules@xcite around @xmath17  k , although is has been suggested @xcite that this freezing alone can not account for the observed structural changes . in region",
    "ii ( @xmath18  k ) nmr measurements @xcite yield a maximum in @xmath19 around @xmath20  k [ fig .  [ master](c ) ] .",
    "upon cooling through this region there is a crossover in transport properties from `` bad metal '' behavior to a more conventional fermi - liquid regime@xcite and a plateau in @xmath15 is also seen [ fig .  [ master](e ) ] .",
    "these phenomena have been linked to pseudogap physics although the details remain unclear@xcite . in region",
    "iii ( @xmath21  k ) a vortex nernst signal is observed @xcite .",
    "it was argued@xcite that the proximity of the @xmath11cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br material to the mott state in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ picture](b ) , results in vortex fluctuations persisting above @xmath4 and , furthermore , this remnant of fluctuating superconductivity may be consistent with the occurrence of phase fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter close to the mott boundary .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : after discussing experimental details in section  ii we present the results of transverse field muon - spin relaxation measurements of the superconducting penetration depth of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br in section  iii .",
    "section  iv describes the use of longitudinal field measurements to investigate spin fluctuations in the normal state of the material and our conclusions are presented in section  v.",
    "muon - spin spectroscopy@xcite is a sensitive means of probing the superconductivity and local magnetism of molecular materials of this sort@xcite .",
    "transverse - field ( tf ) and longitudinal - field ( lf ) muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) measurements were made on a mosaic sample of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2br ] at the isis facility , rutherford appleton laboratory , uk and the swiss muon source ( s@xmath22s ) , paul scherrer institut , ch .",

    "these were arranged on a piece of ag foil to cover an area of @xmath25  @xmath26 so that the conducting layers are parallel to the plane of the mosaic .",
    "tf measurements were made using the musr spectrometer at isis where the sample was mounted on a hematite backing plate in a helium cryostat with the sample oriented at @xmath27 to both the applied magnetic field and the initial muon spin . in order to reduce any effect of ethylene disorder on the superconducting properties ,",
    "the sample was slow cooled at a rate of @xmath28  k / hour .",
    "tf measurements were also made using the gps instrument at s@xmath22s where the sample plane was oriented at @xmath29 to the applied magnetic field and no slow cooling procedure was followed .",
    "lf measurements were made on the argus spectrometer ( isis ) in the latter @xmath29 geometry .",

    "are implanted in the bulk of a material in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath30 , which is applied perpendicular to the initial muon spin direction .",

    "the observed property of the experiment is the time evolution of the muon - spin polarization @xmath35 , which allows the determination of the distribution @xmath36 of local magnetic fields across the sample volume via @xmath37 where the phase @xmath38 results from the detector geometry .    above @xmath4",
    "some broadening of the spectrum is caused by randomly directed nuclear moments relaxing the muon spins .",
    "below @xmath4 the spectrum broadens considerably due to the contribution from the vl , but this component was found to be only @xmath39% of the total signal for @xmath7 . allowing for part of the non - superconducting signal to come from the cryostat and sample mounting material , we estimate that at most 50% of the sample is giving a superconducting signal .",
    "this is significant since it suggests that the majority of muons are not stopped in regions where there is a well defined vl and may indicate the coexistence of a competing phase in this material .",
    "in fact , there is evidence for a phase separation between superconducting and insulating regions in this material@xcite which is strongly dependent on disorder , such as that introduced through rapid cooling . the non - superconducting contribution to our signal for @xmath7 decreases weakly and linearly with increasing temperature .",
    "rapid cooling of the sample was found to reduce the superconducting volume fraction still further .",
    "with such a small superconducting fraction it is difficult to accurately extract detailed lineshape information from our data , however the rms width of the vl field distribution @xmath40 can be straightforwardly obtained by fitting the data to the sum of two gaussian relaxation components , reflecting the superconducting vl and non - superconducting contributions .",
    "these are easily separated below @xmath41 since the contribution from the vl has a much larger relaxation rate .",
    "the field dependence of the vl component is shown in fig .",

    "the low field data ( 40 mt and below ) fit well to the width expected from the solution of a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model of the triangular vl field distribution @xcite with an in - plane penetration depth of 0.47(1 ) @xmath22 m .",
    "@xmath40 is not very sensitive to @xmath42 in this field range , so we assume the reported value @xcite @xmath42=10(2 )  t ; the gl parameter @xmath1 is then estimated to be 80(10 ) .",

    "this field - independent expression is valid at intermediate fields @xmath46 and the @xmath40 value obtained from eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) for @xmath47 = 0.47 @xmath22 m is shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ tffig](a ) ; this is seen to be reasonably close to the field - dependent gl width in a field region centred around 10  mt .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our value of @xmath47 is rather smaller than previous reports , e.g.  the range @xmath48 m obtained from reversible high field magnetization measurements@xcite , and it is significantly lower than the value @xmath49 m estimated from a previous @xmath0sr measurement @xcite in a field of 300  mt .",
    "these differences can be understood by noting that the measured linewidth decreases sharply for @xmath50  mt ( fig .",
    "[ tffig](a ) ) . if this suppressed linewidth were taken to represent a full 3d vl , a penetration depth of order @xmath51 m would also be obtained from our data using eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) , in good agreement with the previous @xmath0sr result .",
    "the decrease in @xmath40 with applied field that we observe is not surprising , given the vortex phase diagram in ( bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu(scn)@xmath2@xcite . in that material the ideal 3d triangular vl which exists at low temperatures and low fields",
    "@xcite is destroyed by the application of fields above a disorder - dependent threshold , that can be as low as 6  mt , causing a transition to a decoupled - layer vortex glass phase , accompanied by a sharp decrease in the measured linewidth @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that a similar transition to a decoupled - layer vortex glass phase occurs in the @xmath11cu[n(cn)@xmath2br material above a theshold field in the 4080  mt region .",
    "the effect on the width of the field distribution in the limit of losing all inter - layer correlation has been calculated@xcite , giving @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the inter - layer spacing and @xmath54 is vortex spacing within the layers .",
    "this limit is shown as the dot - dash line in fig .",
    "[ tffig](a ) and it can be concluded that some residual interlayer correlations remain here since the data points lie significantly above this limit .",
    "a further feature of our data in the decoupled vortex phase is that the superconducting fraction recovers to the larger value obtained in measuremants made under slow - cooling conditions , suggesting that the disorder - induced phase separation is becoming significantly reduced once the layers are decoupled .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath40 has been measured in a field of 3 mt applied in a 45@xmath55 geometry and this is shown in fig .  [ tffig](b ) .",
    "this can be fitted to an empirical power law @xmath56 , % $ \\label{one}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the zero temperature contribution from the vl .",
    "the vl here therefore appears to thermally stable , in contrast to the case of ( bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu(scn)@xmath2 where a clear melting of the vl is seen @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath57=0.31(1 )  mt and @xmath41=11.3(4 )  k are obtained from the fit .",
    "the penetration depth in the highly conducting planes could be obtained by taking @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) , however the absolute accuracy is reduced compared to 90@xmath55 measurements for two reasons : firstly the width measured at @xmath27 is particularly sensitive to any angular misalignment between the sample and field and secondly the angular scaling in highly anisotropic superconductors can be much more complex than the simple form implied by eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) @xcite . returning to the 90@xmath55 data , we note that a marginally better fit is obtained by allowing for an asymmetric lineshape @xcite parameterized using the skewness parameter @xmath59 .",
    "the optimum fit is achieved with @xmath60 , which is reasonably close to the ideal triangular lattice value of 0.60 , that was observed in more detailed studies of the vortex phases of the x = cu(ncs)@xmath2 compound @xcite .",
    "this fit also yields 0.47(1 )  @xmath22 m for @xmath47 .",
    "the values obtained here and in previous muon studies for 90@xmath55 geometry are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we may compare our values of @xmath47 and @xmath4 for the x = cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br material to values obtained previously for the x = cu(scn)@xmath2 material .",
    "this is shown as the inset to fig .",
    "[ tffig](b ) and suggests that there is a scaling relation between these two parameters .",
    "although this pair of @xmath1-phase points lie rather close , a simple linear scaling @xcite would be reasonably consistent with the data .",
    "more generally , a @xmath61 scaling has been suggested to apply when a broader range of molecular superconductors is considered @xcite , but more data would be required to test whether this holds or not within the subset of @xmath1-phase bedt - ttf compounds .",
    "we now turn to the local magnetic fluctuations in the normal state of this system , which we probe with lf @xmath0sr measurements made in a field of @xmath62  mt . in these measurements",
    "the initial muon spin is directed parallel to the applied field and we measure the polarization @xmath63 along the same direction via the muon asymmetry function @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "dynamics in the local magnetic field distribution will cause muon spins to flip leading to a depolarization with relaxation rate @xmath65 .",
    "the small applied longitudinal field was intended to quench the contribution to the spectra of background from nuclear moments allowing the contribution due to electron spin dynamics to be discerned .    a typical lf @xmath0sr spectrum measured at 20  k is shown in fig .  [ lambdat](a ) .",
    "the relaxing amplitude is quite small , but this is not unexpected given previous zero field muon results measured on a related bedt - ttf material @xcite . in that study , muons were shown to be sensitive to magnetic order within the organic layers but only a small relaxing asymmetry was observed .",
    "we therefore expect that our results will reflect magnetic fluctuations within the organic layers of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath5 . above 100",
    "k our spectra are best described with a single exponential function with relaxation rate @xmath65 characteristic of dynamic fluctuations in the local magnetic field at the muon sites in the material . for @xmath66",
    "k , there is a single , highly damped , temperature dependent oscillation visible for times @xmath67s . in this context ,",
    "spectra of this form suggest a contribution from quasistatic disordered magnetic moments which is typically described by a kubo - toyabe ( kt ) function@xcite @xmath68 where the data are best fitted with a constant field width @xmath69  mhz for all @xmath66  k. we note that this is quite large for randomized nuclear fields ( where typically @xmath70  mhz ) and given the small size of the electronic moments observed with muons in bedt - ttf layers previously @xcite it may be that this signal results from a population of static disordered electronic moments .",
    "the origin of such quasistatic electronic moments is unclear although we note that there is no decrease in @xmath71 with increasing @xmath72 as would occur in the presence of magnetic order .",
    "we note that it is possible that this signal arises from those portions of the sample not contributing to the superconducting vl in tf measurements .",
    "the dynamic contribution to the spectra for @xmath73  k was found to be best modelled by multiplying the kt function by an exponential factor @xmath74 and the data were fitted to the resulting functional form @xmath75 the extracted relaxation rates @xmath65 are shown in fig .",
    "[ master](a ) and inset in fig .",
    "[ lambdat](b ) .",
    "other parameterizations are possible but lead to less successful fits . however , for comparison , a fit across the measured temperature regime of a single exponential with relaxation rate @xmath65 is shown in fig .",
    "[ master](a ) , where we see that both track the same behavior .    at temperatures",
    "@xmath66  k , the dominant trend is a roughly linear increase in relaxation rate with @xmath72 up to around 100  k , above which it drops precipitously [ inset fig .  [ lambdat](b ) ] .",
    "the linear regime observed for @xmath66  k is typical of a korringa law relaxation @xcite , resulting from flip - flop transitions of electronic and muon spins , and which is expected to lead to a relaxation rate @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the imaginary part of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility and @xmath78 is the hyperfine coupling .",
    "for the case of a @xmath79-independent coupling , we obtain @xmath80^{2}$ ] , showing that the muon relaxation rate probes the local spin susceptibility @xmath81 . the sharp decrease in relaxation rate around 100  k",
    "broadly coincides with region i , which may suggest a link with the ethylene disorder effects and glass - like transition in this region .",
    "given the korringa law behavior observed at low temperatures , it is likely that the crossover to nonmetallic behavior of the system near region i [ fig .",
    "[ master](b ) ] changes the nature of the muons coupling to the material and that at these elevated temperatures a different , dominant relaxation channel presumably opens up .",
    "to further investigate the temperature evolution of the local susceptibility from the korringa relaxation we plot @xmath82 against @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ lambdat](b ) .",
    "we see that on warming above @xmath4 the quantity @xmath83 peaks at around 15  k before decreasing sharply around region  iii ( @xmath84  k ) indicating a significant decrease of the local magnetic susceptibility in this region . above 30",
    "k @xmath83 decreases only gradually throughout region ii until dropping off suddenly in region i.    our muon @xmath83 results are quite different to the nmr @xmath19 results [ fig.[master ] ] where a parger peak is seen in region ii .",
    "we do not see any dramatic change of behavior in region ii in the @xmath0sr results , while there is no suggestion of any anomaly in the nmr behavior in regions  i and iii .",
    "in fact , the nmr results for @xmath85  k@xmath86  k are well described by a model of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite based on the mmp model@xcite , which predicts @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath31 are constants that depend on the correlation length of the spin fluctuations whose energy scale is determined by the temperature parameter @xmath89 . as shown fig .  [",
    "lambdat](b ) the model fits the muon @xmath65 only passably well for @xmath66  k becomes gradually worse as region  iii approached from above . however , given that the muon sites in this material are likely to be different to the @xmath90c site where the nuclear resonance is achieved@xcite , it is possible that the muon will probe a quite different field distribution to that probed in nmr .",
    "we note further that our muon results are also quite different to the lf @xmath0sr behavior observed in molecular superconductors such as the alkali - fullerides @xcite where @xmath83 is quite featureless above @xmath4 .",
    "in conclusion , our investigation of the superconducting and normal state properties of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br using implanted muons has allowed us to identify a number of experimental features of this system . in the superconducting phase",
    "two important effects are seen : firstly , a reduced superconducting signal fraction that is affected by sample cooling rate and is consistent with the phase separation suggested by earlier studies and secondly , a vortex transition taking place between 40  mt and 80  mt , that reduces the width of the magnetic field distribution for higher measurement fields . by taking these two effects carefully into account",
    "we have obtained an improved and more reliable estimate for the @xmath91 in - plane penetration depth @xmath47=0.47(1 ) @xmath22 m and find that the trend of @xmath41 increasing with superfluid stiffness @xmath92 for @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath93x superconductors is consistent with the overall trend for molecular superconductors , whereas previous data had suggested that @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br was anomalous in this regard . in the normal state",
    "we find a large peak in the longitudinal muon spin relaxation rate around 100  k , coinciding with the region where ethylene disorder effects are prevalent .",
    "we also observe an enhancement of the local magnetic spin susceptibility above @xmath4 where vortex fluctuations occur in nernst measurements .",
    "it would be desirable in future to extend @xmath0sr studies of the normal state magnetic properties to the other members of this series in order to follow how these features evolve across the phase diagram .",
