    "do gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) accelerate cosmic rays ( crs ) ?",
    "there are arguments in favor of such an idea @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that crs are accelerated via the fermi mechanism in which a particle crosses the shock many times and gradually gains its energy . for an ultra - relativistic shock ,",
    "a steady - state universal power - law energy distribution of particles shall form @xcite .",
    "the shock shall accelerate all particle species , but the electrons being much lighter than protons and ions will also loose their energy via synchrotron cooling . this radiation is thought to be observed as the delayed afterglow emission of grb sources .",
    "a problem immediately arises here from a simple estimate : if the x - ray afterglow observed on a day timescale after the prompt burst is indeed the synchrotron radiation from the shock - accelerated electrons , then the pre - shock medium has to be highly magnetized with the fields of milligauss strengths @xcite .",
    "thus , either the magnetic field is somehow generated in the shock upstream , or the conventional paradigm of the grb afterglow needs revision .    in this paper , we present a self - similar model of the large region in front of a relativistic shock  the foreshock .",
    "this region is populated with the shock - accelerated particles , which stream away from the shock into the collisionless ambient medium and generate magnetic field via a streaming ( weibel - type ) instability .",
    "the model predicts the generation of strong , sub - gauss , magnetic fields in the entire foreshock whose thickness is @xmath0 and is comparable to the shock radius , @xmath3 , in the afterglow phase a day or more after the explosion , when the shock is weakly relativistic or non - relativistic .",
    "the fields are sustained against dissipation by the anisotropy of newly accelerated particles .",
    "moreover , these fields are relatively large - scale , with the coherence length being as large as a fraction of the foreshock size , @xmath4 , which makes them effectively decoupled from dissipation .",
    "we speculate , that these mesoscale magnetic fields being ultimately advected into the shock downstream can significantly increase the radiative efficiency of grb afterglows and , perhaps , explain the origin of the magnetic field in an external shock of a grb .",
    "we remark here , however , that our study is analytical and can not account for a number of nonlinear feedback effects of the generated fields and pre - conditioned external medium onto the shock structure and particle acceleration .",
    "kinetic and hybrid computer modeling is essential for better and more accurate understanding of the foreshock structure .",
    "overall , our model is as follows .",
    "a shock is a source of crs which move away from it , thus forming a stream of particles through the ambient medium , say , the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "if the ism magnetic fields are negligible , i.e. , their energy density is small compared to that of crs , the streaming instability ( either the pure magnetostatic weibel or the mixed - mode electromagnetic oblique weibel - type instability , depending on conditions ) is excited and stronger magnetic fields are quickly generated .",
    "these fields further isotropize ( thermalize ) the cr stream .",
    "since less energetic particles , having a greater number density and carrying more energy overall , are thermalized closer to the shock , the generated b - field will be stronger closer to the shock and fall off away from it , whereas its correlation length will increase with the increasing distance from the shock .",
    "more energetic particles keep streaming because of their larger larmor radii and produce the magnetic field further away from the shock",
    ". this process stops at distances where either the cr flux starts to decrease ( because of the finite distance the cr particles can get away from a relativistic shock or because of the shock curvature causing cr density to decrease as @xmath5 if the shock is sub- or non - relativistic ) or where the generated magnetic fields become comparable to the ism field and the instability ceases .",
    "thus , a large upstream region  the foreshock  is populated with magnetic fields .",
    "we now derive its self - similar structure .",
    "we work in the shock co - moving frame unless stated otherwise .",
    "let s consider a relativistic shock moving along @xmath6-direction with the bulk lorentz factor @xmath7 ; the shock is plane - parallel and lies in the @xmath8-plane , and @xmath9 denotes the shock position .",
    "the shock continuously accelerates cosmic rays , which then propagate away from it into the upstream region .",
    "we conventionally assume that the cr distribution over the particle lorentz factor is described by a power - law : n_cr = n_0(/_0)^-s [ ncr ] for @xmath10 and zero otherwise . here",
    "the index @xmath11 is approximately equal to 1.2 for ultrarelativistic shocks and @xmath12 is the normalization . with @xmath13 being @xmath14 for relativistic shocks ; hence the density of particles of energy @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "] we assume that the above energy distribution is the same everywhere in the upstream , that is , we neglect the nonlinear feedback of magnetic fields onto the particle distribution .",
    "the cr momentum distribution exhibits strong anisotropy : the parallel ( @xmath6 ) components of cr momenta are much greater than their thermal spread in the perpendicular ( @xmath8 ) plane . indeed , for a particle to move away from the shock , it should have the @xmath6-component of the velocity exceeding the shock velocity . since both the shock and the particle move nearly at the speed of light , this puts a constraint on their relative angle of propagation to be less then @xmath17 in the lab ( observer ) frame .",
    "hence , the transverse spread of the cr particle s momenta is @xmath18 .",
    "this is also seen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the cr particles propagate through the self - generated foreshock fields and scatter off them .",
    "lower energy particles are deflected in the fields more strongly and , therefore , izotropize faster than the higher energy ones , as having larger larmor radii . at a position @xmath19 the cr distribution",
    "can roughly be divided into isotropic ( themalized ) component with @xmath20 and streaming component with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the minimum lorentz factor of the streaming particles at a location @xmath6 ; it is also the maximum lorentz factor of the randomized component at this location .",
    "the streaming component is weibel - unstable with a very short @xmath23-folding time @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the relativistic plasma frequency , @xmath26 is the density of streaming particles of the lorentz factor @xmath27 ( tilde denotes streaming particles ) .",
    "note that the weibel instability growth rate depends on @xmath28 of the lower density component  cosmic rays , in our case  measured in the center of mass frame of the streaming plasmas .",
    "for the lower - energy part of the cr distribution , the center of mass frame is approximately the shock co - moving frame , hence we evaluate the instability on the shock frame .",
    "this approximation is less accurate for the high - energy cr tail ; however , the growth rate and the scale length are weak functions of the the shock lorentz factor ( @xmath29 ) , so the result will be accurate within an order of magnitude for all reasonable values of @xmath7 for grb afterglows . here",
    "we use the proton plasma frequency because the cr electron lorentz factors are about @xmath30 times larger , so they behave almost like protons @xcite .",
    "the instability is very fast : it rapidly saturates ( the fields cease to grow ) in a few tens of @xmath23-folding times @xmath31 , that is in few tens of inertial lengths ( also referred to as the ion skin length ) @xmath32 in front of the shock .",
    "thereafter the particles keep streaming in current filaments and the field around them amounts to @xmath33 or so of the kinetic energy of this group of particles : b^2()/8~_bm_pc^2n ( ) , [ b - gamma ] where @xmath34 is the efficiency factor obtained from particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations ; @xmath34 has the same meaning as the conventional @xmath35 parameter reserved here for the ratio of the total magnetic energy to the total kinetic energy of the shock and which , as is seen in pic simulations , is larger than @xmath34 near the shock because of the nonlinear evolution and filament mergers .",
    "the correlation length of the field is of the order of the ion inertial length ( ) ~c/_p , rel=(m_pc^2 /4e^2 n())^1/2 .",
    "[ lambda - gamma ]    these random fields deflect cr particles and ultimately lead to their isotropization .",
    "the deflection angle of the particle on a field coherence length scale in the self - generated field is ~p_/p~(/c)_b , [ theta - gamma ] where @xmath36 , @xmath13 is the particle momentum and @xmath37 is it s transverse change . using eqs .",
    "( [ b - gamma ] ) , ( [ lambda - gamma ] ) , we obtain : ~eb()()/(m_pc^2)~. note that the deflection angle is independent of the particle s energy , as long as the field is produced by the particles of the same energy @xmath27 .",
    "the particles diffuse in the field and their rms deflection angle after transiting through a distance @xmath6 is @xmath38 .",
    "the group of particles thermalizes when @xmath39 , i.e. , at the distance from the shock : x_r~/^2~()/(2_b ) .",
    "[ x - gamma ] at this point , @xmath40 , one has @xmath41 by definition ; no field of the strength @xmath42 and the scale @xmath43 can be produced at @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , one can estimate the randomization of the higher energy particles with @xmath45 : @xmath46 , which means that these particles keep streaming through much larger distances @xmath47 and will produce the magnetic field further away from the shock",
    ". this field will be weaker and larger scale because of the lower density of the streaming particles @xmath48 , according to eqs .",
    "( [ ncr])([lambda - gamma ] ) .    finally , the number density of streaming cr particles at @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , ( _ r ) ~(m_pc^2 _ 0/4e^2 n_0)^1/2(_r/_0)^(1+s)/2 _ 0(_r/_0)^(1+s)/2 , where @xmath51 is the inertial length of the lowest energy cr  plasma \" . inverting this expression yields : _",
    "r~_0[(_r)/_0]^2/(1+s ) ~_0(2_bx_r/_0)^2/(1+s ) . [ gamma_r ]",
    "hereafter , the subscript `` @xmath52 '' can be omitted without loss of clarity .    in a steady state , this field is continuously advected toward the shock ( in the shock co - moving frame since the center of mass frame of the foreshock plasma differs from the shock frame ) and may affect the onset and the saturation level of the weibel instability .",
    "in addition , the current filaments producing the fields merge with time , so that @xmath53 and @xmath54 change while being advected .",
    "these nonlinear feed - back effects are difficult to properly account for in a theoretical model ; hence they are omitted in the current study .",
    "pic simulations can help us to quantify the effects as well as to confirm or disprove our assumption that the shock and the foreshock do form a self - sustained , steady state structure .",
    "the self - similar structure of the foreshock immediately follows from eqs .",

    "we neglected the advected fields @xmath57 as sub - dominant compared to @xmath42 for @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath35 parameter expresses the field energy normalized to the shock kinetic energy .",
    "the energy of cosmic rays is @xmath59 and constitutes a fraction @xmath60 of the total shock energy , @xmath61",
    ". the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration , @xmath60 , can be as high as several tens percent , perhaps , up to @xmath62 , as follows from the nonlinear shock modeling @xcite .",
    "the scaling of @xmath35 is : _",
    "b~_cr_b  ( x / x_0)^-2 . [ epsilonb - x ]    these scalings hold while the shock can be treated as planar and while the ism magnetic fields are negligible compared to the weibel - generated fields .",
    "if the shock is relativistic , cr particles can occupy a narrow region in front of it . assuming cr to propagate nearly at the speed of light , their front is ahead of she shock at the distance @xmath63 $ ] measured in the lab ( observer ) frame , that is at the distance @xmath64 in the shock frame .",
    "also , when the radial distance in the lab frame @xmath65 becomes comparable to the shock radius @xmath66 the curvature of the shock can no longer be neglected : the density of cr particles , which was assumed to be constant in our model , starts to fall as @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to a steeper decline of @xmath53 with distance . obviously , the first constraint is more stringent for a relativistic shock , whereas both are very similar ( within a factor of two ) for a non - relativistic shock .",
    "hence we use the first constraint hereafter . meanwhile , at some distance @xmath67 , the weibel - generated fields can become comparable to the ambient magnetic field , @xmath68 and the weibel instability ceases ; here we used that the ambient field in the shock frame is @xmath69 .",
    "pic simulations @xcite indicate that for low magnetizations @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 , the shock behaves as unmagnetized and the weibel instability dominates .",
    "although there is no a sharp threshold , one sees the weibel instability to be suppressed for lower values of @xmath72 . to the order of magnitude",

    "here we presented a model of a self - similar foreshock produced by protons scattered by a relativistic shock into the unmagnetized or weakly magnetized external medium .",
    "it is immediately applicable to the external shock producing a grb afterglow .",
    "the model predicts that a large region in front of the shock , of thickness of order the shock radius , shall be filled with relatively strong and large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the upstream magnetic field strength and correlation length depend on the distance from the shock and the power - law index of accelerated protons ( cosmic rays ) and are given by eqs .",
    "( [ lambda - x ] ) , ( [ b - x ] ) , ( [ x0b0 ] ) in the shock co - moving frame .",
    "the overall energetics of the field is dominated by large distances ; hence the average foreshock b - field is of sub - milligauss strength and is increasing toward the shock while its typical coherence length is of order of few percent of the shock radius and is decreasing toward the shock .",
    "the result is interesting , especially in the light of observational constraints on the particle acceleration in grb afterglows .",
    "it has been shown that a few - milligauss magnetic fields are needed in front of the shock in order to efficiently fermi - accelerate the electrons to the energies required to produce the observed x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "our model provides a possible and rather natural mechanism for generation of such fields in the far upstream medium .",
    "we also make a prediction that the shock - accelerated electrons will be radiating in the foreshock fields at a characteristic synchrotron frequency given by eqs .",
    "( [ nu - obs ] ) . for reference , @xmath113 at about a day after the burst .",
    "it is possible that nonlinear effects omitted in this analysis ( see discussion below ) may limit the field strength to lower values compared to the present analysis , so the synchrotron peak can move to cm / mm - wave band .",
    "we can speculate that the emission from the foreshock can form an emission region separate from the afterglow shock and show up in the x - ray / optical band in the early afterglow phase and in the radio at the very late times .",
    "the presented results can have interesting implications for the radiative efficiency of external shocks . unlike internal shocks , where electron cooling is extremely fast and a thin shock layer of thickness of a hundred ion inertial lengths may be enough to produce the observed prompt emission @xcite",
    ", the weibel shock model @xcite seems to face the efficiency problem when it is applied to an external shock . in such a shock , magnetic fields shall occupy a much larger region , perhaps the entire downstream region , in order for the shock to produce enough photons that will be observed as a delayed afterglow emission .",
    "this is not very likely ( though not proved to be impossible , yet ) provided that the small - scale fields generated _ at _ the shock can be subject to rapid dissipation .",
    "however , dissipation shall be of much lesser importance for the foreshock fields , which have a ( much ) larger coherence length , eq .",
    "( [ lambda - x ] ) . in the steady state ,",
    "the fields generated in the upstream are advected to the shock and their strength is maintained against dissipation by the anisotropy of the continuously `` refreshed '' cr distribution .",
    "hence , one can expect that the magnetic field near the shock will have the spectrum given in eq .",
    "( [ bspec ] ) .",
    "once these fields pass though the shock into the downstream , they are enhanced by the shock compression and begin to decay . commonly , dissipation is proportional to the inverse gradient scale squared @xmath114 , so that the skin - length - scale fields may eventually disappear .",
    "however , the fields above a certain coherence length , @xmath115 , shall survive and fill up the post - shock medium .",
    "the mechanism of dissipation is not yet understood in detail , so it is premature to make any quantitative conclusions about @xmath115 , but it will certainly be much smaller than @xmath116 , see eq .",
    "( [ lambda - xmax ] ) .",
    "since @xmath117 is a weak function of @xmath54 one can speculate that relatively strong fields , perhaps of order tens or hundreds milligauss , to occupy the post - shock medium .",
    "we want to note that a number of simplifying assumptions has been made in our analysis .",
    "in particular , _ nonlinear feedback _ effects of the upstream magnetic field on the particle distribution , on the shock structure and on fermi acceleration were omitted .",
    "the inclusion of these effects is hardly possible in any analytical model .",
    "we also assumed that a steady state exists for the shock - foreshock system at hand .",
    "apparently , it is not at all clear whether the steady state is at all possible or the system exhibits an intermittent behavior .",
    "one can envision a scenario in which the crs overproduce upstream magnetic fields leading to enhanced particle scattering and the overall preheating of the ambient medium , which , in turn , can cause the shock to weaken , disappear and then re - appear in a different place further upstream .",
    "presently available 2d pic simulations of an electron - position shock do show the upstream field amplification and no steady state has been achieved : both upstream and downstream fields continue to grow for the duration of the simulations @xcite .",
    "we argue that extensive pic or / and hybrid simulations of a shock are imperative for further study .",
    "finally , we mention that our model compliments other models of the magnetic field generation .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the field can be amplified by vortical motions produced by the richtmeyer - meshkov instability , if the ambient medium is clumpy or if the shock velocity is not perfectly uniform @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> radiation from accelerated electrons in the foreshock fields can constitute a separate emission region radiating in the uv / optical through radio band , depending on time and shock parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also speculate that these fields being eventually transported into the shock downstream can greatly increase radiative efficiency of a gamma - ray burst afterglow shock .    </S>",
