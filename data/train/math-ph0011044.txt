    "in the present year 2000 we are celebrating the 100th birthday of quantum theory and the 75th birthday of quantum mechanics .",
    "thus it took only 25 years from the first inception of the new theory until its final consolidation .",
    "quantum field theory is almost as old as quantum mechanics .",
    "but the formulation of a fully consistent synthesis of the principles of quantum theory and classical relativisitic field theory has been a long and agonizing process and , as a matter of fact , has not yet come to a satisfactory end , in spite of many successes .    the best approximation to nature in the microscopic and relativistic regime of elementary particle physics which we presently have , the so called _ standard model _",
    ", does not yet have the status of a mathematically consistent theory .",
    "it may be regarded as an efficient algorithm for the theoretical treatment of certain specific problems in high energy physics , such as the perturbative calculation of collision cross sections , the numerical analysis of particle spectra etc .",
    "yet nobody has been able so far to prove or disprove that the model complies with _ all _ fundamental principles of relativistic quantum physics .",
    "this somewhat embarassing situation is not so widely known .",
    "it is therefore gratifying that the clay mathematics institute has recently drawn attention to it by endowing a price of 1.000.000 $ for the mathematical consolidation of an important piece of the standard model , the yang  mills  theory .",
    "so the mathematical and conceptual problems of relativistic quantum field theory are in many respects a rewarding field of activity for mathematical physicists .",
    "there are two strategies to make further progress .",
    "either one tries to improve the existing mathematical methods for the treatment of models of physical interest .",
    "this is the approach of constructive quantum field theory @xcite . or one proceeds from a sufficiently rigid mathematical framework , consistent with all basic principles of quantum field theory , and aims at new conceptual insights and constructive ideas by structural analysis .    such a general framework which is useful for the solution of both , conceptual puzzles and constructive problems , is _ algebraic quantum field theory _",
    "( aqft ) , frequently also called _ local quantum physics_.",
    "it was invented by rudolf haag and daniel kastler @xcite and has proven to be consistent with the developments in elementary particle physics for several decades .",
    "it is the aim of this contribution to recall the physical ideas and mathematical structures underlying aqft and to outline some recent interesting results which reveal its flexibility for the treatment of a variety of problems .",
    "more systematic recent reviews of this approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the conventional approach to quantum field theory , based on the lagrangian formalism , and algebraic quantum field theory may be compared with the concrete and abstract approaches to differential geometry .",
    "if one is dealing with concrete ( computational ) problems in geometry , it is natural to use coordinates , tensor fields , christoffel symbols etc , whereas in the general structural analysis one relies on intrinsic concepts such as the notions of manifold , fiber bundle , connection etc .",
    "both points of view have their virtues and full insight is only gained by combining them .",
    "the situation is similar in relativistic quantum field theory . in the concrete lagrangian approach ,",
    "one specifies the field content of the theory acting on the given space ",
    "time manifold @xmath0 as well as a corresponding lagrangian .",
    "the difficult step is `` quantization '' which is accomplished either by appealing to the correspondence principle ( canonical quantization ) or to general structural results according to which the problem can be reformulated in terms of classical statistical field theory ( euclidean approach ) . if everything has been said and done , one obtains the vacuum correlation functions of the fields . from them",
    "one can reconstruct a hilbert space on which the observables , such as the stress energy tensor , the currents etc .",
    "act as operators .",
    "the lagrangian approach is well suited for the computational treatment of concrete models , but it is not intrinsic . for different lagrangians with different field content may describe the same physics .",
    "this phenomenon of `` quantum equivalence '' of classical field theories has been observed in many examples @xcite .",
    "one may therefore ask whether there is a more intrinsic way of describing relativistic quantum field theories .    a fully satisfactory answer to this question",
    "is provided by aqft . in this approach",
    "the basic objects are the algebras generated by the observables localized in given space ",
    "time regions ; fields are not mentioned in this setting and are regarded as a kind of coordinates of the algebras .",
    "the passage from the field theoretic setting to the algebraic one requires the following steps :    * determine the set @xmath1 of observables of the underlying theory for each space  time point @xmath2 * construct for each relatively compact space ",
    "time region @xmath3 a corresponding _ local algebra of observables _ , @xmath4 i.e.  the von neumann algebra ( double commutant ) generated by the respective observables in the underlying hilbert space .    in view of the fact that the observables @xmath5 are only defined in the sense of sesquilinear forms ( or as operator valued distributions ) , the latter step is somewhat subtle .",
    "but it has been shown to be meaningful in the models which have been constructed so far @xcite and also in the general wightman setting of quantum field theory under some very general conditions @xcite .",
    "the resulting structure is an assignment of algebras to spacetime regions , @xmath6 which is called a _",
    "local net _ in view of its order preserving properties .",
    "any such net inherits some fundamental properties from the underlying field theory .",
    "these are @xcite    * locality : operators localized in causally disjoint regions commute * covariance : the space  time symmetries act by automorphisms on the net * stability : there exist distinguished states ( expectation functionals ) on the net , describing stable elementary systems such as the vacuum .    whereas the first two points are well understood and have an obvious physical interpretation , the mathematical characterization of elementary states on arbitrary space  time manifolds is a more difficult issue which is still under discussion , cf .",
    "@xcite and references quoted there . for the class of maximally symmetric spaces",
    "there are no such problems , however .    according to the deep insights of haag and kastler , the full physical information of a theory is already contained in the net structure , i.e.  the respective map from space  time regions to algebras .",
    "phrased differently , equivalent quantum field theories can be identified by the fact that they generate isomorphic local nets .",
    "this assertion may be somewhat surprising at first sight since the passage from the observables , which normally have a specific physical interpretation , to the local algebras seems to be a rather forgetful operation .",
    "that no information is lost in this step has been confirmed by now by numerous results @xcite .",
    "a direct way of seeing this has been established by fredenhagen and hertel @xcite who proved for the class of minkowski space theories that the set of basic observables can be recovered from the local net by the formula @xmath7 the somewhat tricky point in this reconstruction is the need to proceed from the algebras @xmath8 of bounded operators to unbounded sesquilinear forms .",
    "it is accomplished by completing these algebras in a suitable locally convex topology , indicated by the bar",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the algebraic framework is in some respect more flexible than the field theoretic setting . for the local algebras may also accommodate extended objects , such as wilson loops or finite mandelstam strings , which are not built from point like observable fields .",
    "aqft is thus compatible with the structures found in the quantum field theories of present physical interest and complements them by putting emphasis on their intrinsic features .",
    "it may thus be regarded as a minimal setting for the description of the systems appearing in high energy physics .",
    "we discuss in the following some issues where the virtues of this approach become manifest .",
    "guided by insights gained from algebraic quantum field theory , brunetti and fredenhagen @xcite have recently established a perturbative construction of local nets on arbitrary globally hyperbolic space ",
    "times @xmath0 .",
    "they propose to treat this problem in two steps : first one constructs the nets of local algebras in some convenient hilbert space representation , thereby fixing the theory .",
    "this step requires control of the notorious ultraviolet divergences ( renormalization ) and can be handled by configuration space methods and microlocal techniques .",
    "infrared problems , related to the so  called adiabatic or infinite volume limit , do not appear in this construction . in a second step",
    "one may then turn to the determination of the states of physical interest on this net and to their analysis .",
    "this requires the passage to new hilbert space representations of the algebraic structures and may thus be regarded as a problem in the representation theory of local nets .    in minkowski space theories both problems",
    "are frequently treated simultaneously because of the possibility of characterizing the vacuum state directly by momentum space properties ( spectrum condition ) .",
    "but , as indicated above , this strategy does not work for arbitrary space  time manifolds .",
    "thus the brunetti ",
    "fredenhagen approach is a very natural way of circumventing these difficulties .",
    "following @xcite , we outline this method by discussing the theory of a self - interacting scalar field on a given space - time @xmath0 .",
    "the perturbative construction of the net requires the following steps :    * consider the free scalar field @xmath9 on the space  time @xmath0 , @xmath10 = -i \\ , \\delta(x , y ) \\ , 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the dalembertian and @xmath12 the causal commutator function on @xmath0 , in a regular hilbert space representation induced by some hadamard state @xcite . *",
    "construct _ wick powers _ of the free field for @xmath13 , @xmath14    the existence of these operator  valued distributions was first established in @xcite by methods of microlocal analysis and shown in @xcite to be largely independent of the chosen regular hilbert space representation .",
    "these wick powers are the building blocks for the construction of interacting fields .",
    "* define the time ordered exponentials ( local s  operators ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is any test function and @xmath17 is the volume form on @xmath0 .",
    "( more generally , one considers such exponentials for finite sums of wick powers . )",
    "the proof that these exponentials are meaningful expressions is the most difficult step in the construction .",
    "it has been established in @xcite in perturbation theory by defining @xmath18 as formal power series in @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficients in this series suffer from ambiguities due to short distance singularities which require renormalization .",
    "this problem is solved by generalizing methods of epstein and glaser ( causal perturbation theory ) .",
    "if @xmath19 , there does not appear a proliferation of these ambiguities with increasing order of perturbation theory ( renormalizability ) .",
    "* use bogolubov s formula @xmath20 to define , for given interaction density @xmath21 , local operators for the cutoff density @xmath22 .    up to this point",
    "the construction is akin to the treatment of minkowski space theories , although the technical details are more involved in view of the absence of space  time symmetries . the adiabatic limit of @xmath23 for @xmath24 may not exist , however , due to infrared problems caused by the _ ad hoc _ choice of a defining representation of the interacting theory .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented by the following important observation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 and let @xmath25 .",
    "there exists a unitary operator @xmath26 such that @xmath27    in view of this result it is meaningful to define local algebras , setting for @xmath3 and any @xmath16 with @xmath28 @xmath29 according to the preceding proposition , these algebras are unique up to isomorphisms @xmath30 , which do not change the physical interpretation .",
    "one may thus proceed to an algebraic adiabatic limit by considering the algebras @xmath31 the inclusion ( net ) structure of this family of algebras is given by their natural embeddings and the algebraic operations of addition , multiplication as well as the * operation in @xmath32 are pointwise defined for each @xmath16 . in this way",
    "one arrives at a ( perturbative ) net @xmath33 for the given interaction .",
    "thus the algebraic point of view leads to a natural perturbative construction of nets of local algebras in any space ",
    "time @xmath0 .",
    "similar methods have also been applied to the construction of local nets of observables in gauge theories in minkowski space @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite and references quoted there .",
    "we turn next to a conceptual problem in minkowski space quantum field theories , namely the asymptotic particle interpretation . in the gauge theories of physical interest , the basic fields are in general unphysical and not related to stable particles .",
    "one has therefore to develop methods to determine the particle features of these theories from the vacuum correlation functions of the local observables .",
    "the confinement problem in quantum chromodynamics and the infraparticle problem in quantum electrodynamics are two well known examples illustrating this issue . here",
    "the algebraic point of view led recently to some interesting progress .",
    "the following steps are necessary in the particle analysis of any theory :    * introduce some meaningful particle concept * establish methods to determine the particle content of the theory * analyze the properties of these particles * develop a scattering ( collision ) theory .",
    "one has a quite satisfactory understanding of these points in theories with short range forces ( mass gap ) .",
    "there the natural starting point is wigner s particle concept , according to which the possible states of a particle are described by vectors in some irreducible representation of the poincar group or its two  fold covering , respectively .",
    "it is well known , however , that this approach does not work , for example , in theories with electrically charged particles , cf .",
    "for example @xcite .",
    "so it seems desirable to develop a universal particle concept which applies also in those cases .",
    "such a more flexible particle concept was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the notion of _ particle weight _ which is a generalization of dirac s idea of an improper momentum eigenstate of a particle .",
    "there are two possibilities of looking at these improper states .    *",
    "traditional : improper momentum eigenstates are regarded as vector valued distributions , i.e.  maps from a space of wave functions into the physical hilbert space , @xmath34 it is anticipated in this approach that the improper states become normalizable by superposition ( interference effects ) .",
    "* alternative : improper states of _ fixed _ momentum are regarded as linear maps from a space @xmath35 of localizing operators into the physical hilbert space , @xmath36 here the improper states become normalizable by localization .",
    "it is important to notice that the second approach is more general than the first one .",
    "it is expected to be applicable even if the superposition principle fails for the improper states .",
    "this happens , for example , if the process of localization is inevitably accompanied by particle production ( such as in quantum electrodynamics , where infinite clouds of soft photons are produced ) .    in quantum mechanics , suitable localizing operators",
    "would be rapidly decreasing functions of the position operator ; but the notion of position operator is not meaningful in a field theoretic setting .",
    "nevertheless , localizing operators @xmath37 exist in aqft in abundance and are easily constructed .",
    "simple examples are all operators of the form @xmath38 here @xmath39 is any test function whose fourier transform vanishes in the forward light cone and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the unitaries inducing the space  time translations @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath42 is any local observable .",
    "the operators @xmath37 can be shown to annihilate all states ( disregarding vectors of arbitrarily small norm ) which do not describe excitations of the vacuum in some ( sufficiently large but finite ) space  time region @xmath43 .",
    "so , roughly speaking , they `` project '' onto states which differ from the vacuum in @xmath43 . in this sense",
    "they are localizing operators .",
    "it is technically important that these localizing operators form a left ideal @xmath44 in the c@xmath45algebra @xmath46 generated by all local observables .",
    "it is convenient to proceed from the improper states to corresponding positive , linear and non ",
    "normalizable functionals on the domain @xmath47 , @xmath48 called particle weights",
    ". these functionals can be characterized in an intrinsic manner . in particular",
    "they are extremal and invariant under space ",
    "time translations .",
    "as @xmath49 is a @xmath50algebra , one can recover by the gns reconstruction theorem the improper particle states from these particle weights .    after having introduced in aqft a general particle concept",
    ", one has to develop methods to determine the particle content of a theory ( described by particle weights ) .",
    "this is accomplished by analyzing the timelike asymptotic properties of the physical states in the vacuum sector @xmath51 of the theory .",
    "so let @xmath52 be any expectation functional induced by vectors in the subspace @xmath53 of the physical hilbert space @xmath54 .",
    "one then considers the functionals @xmath55 these expressions are mathematically meaningful as a consequence of locality and the shape of the energy momentum spectrum @xcite .",
    "moreover , the family of functionals @xmath56 is equibounded .",
    "so this family has limit points @xmath57 the functionals @xmath58 are , by their very construction , invariant under translations , but highly mixed .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether they can be decomposed into particle weights .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question was recently given by porrmann @xcite .",
    "more specifically , there holds the following statement .",
    "@xmath59 where each @xmath60 is a particle weight of momentum @xmath61 and `` internal index '' @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a measure depending on the initial state @xmath64 .",
    "( the internal index @xmath62 describes the intrinsic features of a particle , such as its charge quantum numbers and spin . )",
    "thus the preceding asymptotic construction and subsequent decomposition of functionals provides a general method to determine the stable particle content of any theory , including the charged particles ( which appear in the vacuum sector only as pairs of opposite charge , but asymptotically give rise to particle weights contributing to the mixtures @xmath58 ) .",
    "this result is a substantial generalization of work of araki and haag for massive theories with a complete particle interpretation @xcite .",
    "no _ a priori _ input about particles is necessary for its derivation ; this shows that the concept of particle weight is sufficient for the description of the asymptotic particle features of any theory .",
    "the next step in the analysis is the determination of the possible properties of particle weights . to this end",
    "one first constructs for each particle weight the corresponding sector of the physical hilbert space , @xmath65 one can then establish the following general results @xcite .",
    "* mass : the energy  momentum @xmath61 of the underlying improper state @xmath66 and therefore its mass @xmath67 can be sharply defined in the sector @xmath68 by the formula @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the unitary representation of the translations on @xmath68 ( which can be shown to exist ) . *",
    "spin : if , for given @xmath61 , there is a _",
    "finite _ multiplet of particle weights , there exists a unitary representation @xmath71 of the ( covering group of the ) stability group @xmath72 of @xmath61 such that for @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 are matrix representations of @xmath72 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus if @xmath77 , the particle weights can have spin @xmath78 , in accordance with the results found by wigner .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of wigner particles , there may appear for particle weights with mass @xmath79 representations with arbitrary helicity .",
    "* coherence : let @xmath80 be the decomposition of @xmath68 with respect to the spatial momentum and consider the restrictions @xmath81 of the generator @xmath82 of the time translations to the respective subspaces . for the point spectrum of these restrictions there appear the possibilities @xmath83    the former case corresponds to the familiar situation of wigner particles , where the improper states @xmath84 are affiliated with the same sector and thus can coherently be superimposed . in the latter case , where @xmath85 has purely continuous spectrum for @xmath86 , the superposition principle fails for particle weights of different momenta .",
    "this situation is expected to prevail in theories with long range forces .    in view of the latter result it seems a rewarding experimental challenge to test the status of the superposition principle for electrically charged particle weights .",
    "the theory predicts that there ought to be a substantial difference in the asymptotic coherence properties of electrically neutral and charged particles .    in a final step",
    "one has to establish a collision theory for particles described by weights .",
    "in general one may not expect that a scattering matrix exists for these entities , but it is always possible to define and compute collision cross sections .",
    "a general method to this effect has been outlined in @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section with the remark that , in contrast to the case of many particle quantum mechanics , the completeness of the particle interpretation in quantum field theory is still an open problem , even in the case of short range forces .",
    "a survey of the state of the art can be found in @xcite .",
    "triggered by developments in string theory , known under the catchwords of holography or ads / cft correspondence ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references quoted there ) , there has recently emerged interest in the relation between quantum field theories on different space ",
    "time manifolds .",
    "one speaks of _ holography _ if there is a correspondence between a quantum field theory on a space ",
    "time @xmath87 and a theory on its boundary @xmath88 .",
    "in other words , given the theory on @xmath87 , one can unambiguously determine the theory on @xmath89 and _ vice versa_. a related notion is _ transplantation _",
    ", where such a correspondence exists between theories on space ",
    "times @xmath87 , @xmath89 of equal dimension .",
    "in the conventional field theoretic setting a satisfactory understanding of these issues seems impossible .",
    "it is clear from the outset that one can not identify point fields on @xmath87 and @xmath89 in a meaningful way , @xmath90 with regard to holography ,",
    "the best one can do is to proceed from a field theory on @xmath87 by restriction to a corresponding theory on @xmath89 , cf .  @xcite .",
    "but it is in general impossible to recover from the latter data the original fields .",
    "similar problems hamper also the idea of transplanting fields .",
    "here the algebraic point of view provides a solution : bearing in mind that a theory is fixed by the underlying net , one realizes that it is sufficient ( and frequently possible ) to identify local algebras for certain sufficiently rich families of regions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 thereby establishing a rigid link between the two theories in question .",
    "this insight was first used by rehren in his analysis of the issue of holography @xcite .",
    "similar ideas were applied to the problem of transplantation in @xcite .",
    "we outline in the following the underlying simple geometrical facts .",
    "holography : + the simplest example , where the idea of holography can be illustrated , is the correspondence between quantum field theories on anti  de sitter space ( ads ) and on its minkowskian boundary . in proper coordinates ,",
    "ads can be envisaged as a full cylinder whose tube like boundary is conformal minkowski space .    as indicated above",
    ", one has to identify suitable regions in the given space",
    " times in order to establish a correspondence between the respective theories . for the case at hand , rehren proposed to consider a family of causally complete wedge  shaped regions @xmath94 . their intersections with the boundary of ads",
    "are diamond shaped regions , @xmath95 , cf .",
    "figure 1 .",
    "it is crucial that with this choice there exists a bijection @xmath96 between these regions which is    * causal : @xmath97 , where the prime indicates causal complementation * symmetric : @xmath98 for @xmath99 , where iso and conf indicate the isometry and conformal group of the respective spaces * order preserving : @xmath100 if @xmath101 .    after these geometrical preparations it is straightforward to establish the desired correspondence between nets on ads and @xmath102ads as well as the corresponding unitary representations of the respective symmetry groups and the vacuum states , setting    * @xmath103  for  @xmath104 * @xmath105 * @xmath106 .    starting from a local , covariant and stable net on ads one obtains in this way a local , conformally covariant and stable net on minkowski space and _ vice versa _",
    "( by reading the defining relations from right to left ) .",
    "so one arrives at @xcite    there is a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between local , covariant and stable qft s on ads and on @xmath102ads = conformal minkowski space .",
    "it seems plausible that the general idea of holography can also be applied to other space  time manifolds with suitable boundaries .",
    "+ transplantation : + the possibility of identifying quantum field theories on space  times of equal dimension ( transplantation ) has been exemplified in @xcite for a special class of robertson  walker space  times ( rw ) . in this approach",
    "one makes use of the fact that these space  times can be conformally embedded into de sitter space ( ds ) .",
    "given this embedding , one chooses a certain specific family @xmath107 of diamond shaped regions in ds and , taking the intersection with rw of those regions @xmath108 whose edge lies completely in rw , one obtains a corresponding family of regions @xmath109 in rw , @xmath110 this construction is indicated in figure 2 .",
    "we mention as an aside that the respective regions can also be characterized in an intrinsic coordinate independent manner .",
    "given these regions , there exists a unique bijection @xmath111 : @xmath112 with the property of being    * causal :   @xmath113 * symmetric : @xmath114 , @xmath115    here @xmath116 denotes the induced action of the elements @xmath16 of the isometry group of de sitter space , iso ds , on the family of regions @xmath109 .",
    "this action can in general not be described by a point transformation on rw .",
    "but if @xmath117 one has @xmath118 .    on the basis of these geometrical facts it is straightforward to establish a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between theories on ds and rw , setting    * @xmath119  iff @xmath120 * @xmath121 ,  @xmath122    an immediate consequence of the geometrical properties of @xmath111 is @xcite    each local , covariant _ ds_theory can be mapped to a local , covariant ( ultra symmetric ) _",
    "rw_theory and _ vice versa_.    here the term `` ultra symmetric '' means that the resulting rw theory exhibits , besides the familiar space ",
    "time isometries , an aditional geometrical symmetry which is _ not _ induced by point transformations .",
    "this situation differs from the ads / cft correspondence , where the minkowskian theory on the boundary of ads is conformally invariant .",
    "an intriguing recent result in algebraic quantum field theory is the insight that local nets can be constructed from a few local algebras in suitable `` relative positions '' @xcite .",
    "it is of interest in this context that the local von neumann algebras are universal ( model independent ) objects : they are generically to the _ unique _ hyperfinite type iii@xmath123 factor @xcite .",
    "so the starting point of this novel construction is a concrete and well  studied algebra , denoted by @xmath0 in the following ; the second ingredient is a standard ( cyclic and separating ) vector @xmath124 for @xmath0 in the underlying hilbert space .",
    "given these quantities , one can consistently define a conjugation @xmath125 it is an anti  linear closable operator whose closure is denoted by the same symbol and whose polar decomposition has the form @xmath126 here @xmath127 is an anti  unitary operator , called _ modular conjugation _ , and the positive selfadjoint operator @xmath128 is the _ modular operator_. the corresponding unitary group @xmath129 is called _",
    "modular group_. irrespective of the choice of @xmath0 and @xmath124 within the above limitations , there hold the following basic relations established by tomita and takesaki :    * @xmath130 * @xmath131    based on these facts , wiesbrock introduced in @xcite the notion of _ half  sided modular inclusion _ of a von neumann algebra @xmath132 , where @xmath133 likewise has @xmath124 as standard vector , by posing the condition @xmath134 the unitary group @xmath135 , obtained by the trotter product formula @xmath136 then has the following properties @xcite .",
    "let @xmath132 be a half  sided modular inclusion .",
    "the corresponding modular groups generate a unitary representation of @xmath137 such that    * @xmath138 * @xmath139 * the spectrum of the generator of @xmath135 is contained in @xmath140 * @xmath141 .",
    "an analogous result holds if @xmath140 is replaced by @xmath142 in @xmath143 .",
    "another useful concept , characterizing the relative position of von neumann algebras , is the notion of _ modular intersection _ @xcite : two von neumann algebras @xmath0 , @xmath133 are said to have modular intersection if @xmath144 is half  sided modular in @xmath0 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "similarly to the situation discussed in the preceding proposition , the modular groups can be shown to generate a unitary representations of a lie group in the latter case as well .",
    "these general mathematical facts have immediate applications in algebraic quantum field theory .",
    "local nets on @xmath145  @xcite + any modular inclusion fixes a local , covariant and stable net of local algebras on the light ray @xmath145 .",
    "one first assigns algebras to half lines , setting @xmath146 the algebras corresponding to arbitrary intervals @xmath147 \\subset \\rr$ ] are given by @xmath148 it then follows from the preceding proposition and the basic relations of tomita  takesaki  theory that the net @xmath149 on @xmath145 is local ( operators localized in disjoint intervals commute ) , @xmath150covariant and stable ( @xmath124 being a ground state for @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus , given two algebras in suitable relative position , one can construct a full chiral quantum field theory .",
    "( in a similar way one sees that any modular intersection fixes a conformally invariant quantum field theory on the compactified light ray s@xmath151 . )",
    "local nets on @xmath152  @xcite + in order to obtain in a similar manner local nets on higher dimensional space  times , one has to proceed from a larger set of algebras in appropriate relative positions . in the case of two  dimensional minkowski space , one starts from three algebras , forming two half  sided modular inclusions @xmath153 . by the preceding proposition one",
    "then has two unitary groups @xmath154 , where @xmath155 are interpreted as light cone coordinates of @xmath156 .",
    "these groups are assumed to commute , @xmath157 in this way one obtains a unitary positive energy representation @xmath135 of the translations @xmath152 on which the modular group of @xmath0 acts like a lorentz transformation , @xmath158 one then can proceed as in the preceding case and define algebras for wedge shaped regions of the form @xmath159 , setting @xmath160 the algebras associated with diamonds @xmath161 , cf .",
    "figure 3 , are obtained by setting @xmath162 in this way one arrives at a local , poincar  covariant net on @xmath152 where @xmath124 describes the vacuum vector .",
    "local nets on @xmath163 , @xmath164  @xcite + the construction of local nets from a few algebras was recently extended to three and four  dimensional minkowski space in @xcite .",
    "the crucial and difficult step in this approach is the formulation of conditions which guarantee that the modular groups affiliated with the algebras and the underlying vector @xmath124 generate representations of the poincar group @xmath165 .",
    "any family of algebras @xmath166 in suitable modular positions fixes a local , @xmath165covariant net on @xmath163 with vacuum state @xmath124 .",
    "we refrain from giving here the precise conditions on the algebras and only note that , in analogy to the cases discussed before , the corresponding modular groups generate representation of @xmath165 with positive energy .",
    "the algebras @xmath167 can consistently be assigned to wedge regions in @xmath163 and the local algebras associated with diamonds are defined by taking intersections .",
    "the converse of this statement is a well  known theorem by bisognano and wichmann @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "these intriguing results should admit a generalization to other space  time manifolds , cf .",
    "also @xcite for a related approach .",
    "moreover , they seem to be of relevance for the classification of local nets and are possibly a step towards a novel , completely algebraic approach to the construction of local nets .",
    "the preceding account of recent results in aqft illustrates the role of this approach in relativistic quantum field theory : it is a concise framework which is suitable for the development of new constructive schemes , the mathematical implementation of physical concepts and ideas , the elaboration of general computational methods and the clarification of the relation between different theories as well as their structural analysis and classification .",
    "so this framework complements the more concrete approaches to relativistic quantum field theory and thereby contributes to the understanding and mathematical consolidation of this important area of mathematical physics .",
