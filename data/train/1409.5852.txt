    "to address the effects of anharmonicity , we consider the model potential @xmath95 for a 1d optical lattice , which is a good approximation near the trap center .",
    "this potential introduces three leading - order anharmonic corrections to ( 3 ) , which are the quartic potentials @xmath96 for the initial and likewise for the final lattice , where @xmath97 .",
    "far from the axial trap center , a finite rayleigh length introduces additional ( e.g. , cubic ) leading - order corrections .    for a transition between a pair of known trap states in the initial and final lattices",
    "we may approximate the light shift of each @xmath98 by its first - order perturbation , @xmath99 where primes denote final - lattice values .",
    "these shifts introduce the corrections @xmath100 to the total light shift @xmath51 of ( 7 ) , where the brackets denote a thermal average over the allowed pairs of initial and final trap states .",
    "for axial sideband ( sb ) transitions , the effects of @xmath66-dependent excitation rates must be included in this average , as described in the next section . in the lamb - dicke ( ld ) and resolved - sideband regimes with suppressed transverse sb transitions , the trap state pairs satisfy @xmath101 where the integer @xmath102 is introduced to distinguish between axial carrier ( @xmath103 ) and first - order axial sb transitions ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "surprisingly , carrier transitions are nearly unchanged by the leading - order corrections ( [ vxx][vrr ] ) , because the first - order light shifts ( [ deij],[wij ] ) are zero : @xmath105 before evaluating these quantities explicitly in the next section , we can explain this general result as follows .",
    "first , note that any form for @xmath106 must be proportional to the polarizability @xmath107 .",
    "thus , any anharmonic corrections to ( 3 ) , such as ( [ vxx][vrr ] ) , must also be proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "next , note that the expectations @xmath108 and @xmath109 for harmonic oscillator states .",
    "the matrix elements in ( [ deij ] ) for the @xmath110 of ( [ vxx]-[vrr ] ) are therefore independent of @xmath111 and @xmath107 , respectively , and must be equal , thus producing no differential shift .",
    "this general insensitivity of the carrier light shift to quartic anharmonicities also applies to the model potentials @xmath112 and @xmath113 for 2d and 3d optical lattices .      for axial",
    "sb transitions with @xmath114 , the total light shift @xmath51 of ( 7 ) due to the harmonic potential ( 3 ) must be modified as follows .",
    "first , there is an `` axial - sb shift '' from the final lattice , @xmath115 which must be added as a fourth part to @xmath51 .",
    "next , if @xmath116 , the populations of the initial lattice with @xmath117 will not participate in the transition , so the expectation @xmath118 must be computed accordingly .",
    "this asymmetry also leads to the relation ( 2 ) between temperature and the ratio of sb areas .    additionally , for sb transitions the excitation rates depend on @xmath66 .",
    "the expectation @xmath118 is no longer solely thermal , but must account for this inhomogeneous excitation by weighting each value of @xmath66 with the square of its rabi frequency for the transition , @xmath119 where the ld parameter @xmath120 and the axial wavenumber @xmath121 . as before , we assume the trap states are approximately orthonormal , @xmath122 , which may need to be modified if @xmath1 is far from unity . after normalizing the probabilities for each @xmath66 , the weighted expectations are @xmath123/2   & d = 0 \\\\ \\text{coth}\\left [ \\delta_x/2 \\right]+1/2     & d = -1 \\\\ \\text{coth}\\left [ \\delta_x/2 \\right]-1/2     & d = + 1 \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as before @xmath124 .    hence ,",
    "although the form of @xmath125 given by ( 10 ) , @xmath126 will be unchanged for sbs , the value of @xmath53 will depend on @xmath102 following ( [ nxwithd ] ) .",
    "note that the form and value of @xmath127 given by ( 11 ) , @xmath128 is the same for sbs as for carriers .",
    "the anharmonic corrections ( [ vxx][vrr ] ) are important for sbs , unlike carriers , especially for state - insensitive ` magic ' traps with @xmath14 . the contributions ( [ wij ] ) to the shift @xmath51 from these corrections are @xmath129 for both carrier and sb transitions , as derived below .",
    "importantly , note that all these contributions are zero for carriers as argued above , since @xmath130 if @xmath103 .",
    "the expression ( [ wxx ] ) for @xmath131 follows from the expectation @xmath132 @xcite , which gives the matrix elements @xmath133 and from noting that @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the expression for @xmath136 follows from expectations of the form @xmath137 , which give the matrix elements @xmath138 and from noting that @xmath139 .",
    "the shift @xmath140 of ( [ wrr ] ) is then zero because the condition ( [ ortho ] ) includes only radial carrier transitions .",
    "that is , @xmath141 of ( [ vrr ] ) contributes no shift for the same reasons that @xmath142 if @xmath143 .    to demonstrate the effects of anharmonicity on the lineshape of sb transitions ,",
    "let us treat the case of a magic lattice with @xmath14 where there is no thermal broadening of the carrier . in this case",

    "note that ( [ wxx],[wxr ] ) are related to ( [ dexx],[dexr ] ) via ( [ wij ] ) with @xmath14 .",
    "together , the shifts ( [ dexr],[dexx ] ) lead to similar lineshapes as derived for carrier transitions . as before ,",
