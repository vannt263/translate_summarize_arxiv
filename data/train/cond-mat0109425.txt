    "non - stationary phenomena in type - ii superconductors have attracted attention since the middle sixties . varying the dc magnetic field results in an increase of the ac losses in the mixed state @xcite . moreover , while sweeping a dc magnetic field between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , a second harmonic signal appears in the response to the ac field excitation @xcite .",
    "h. j. fink @xcite showed that the second harmonic signal reaches maximum at a sweep rate @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the frequency and amplitude of ac field respectively , and disappears when @xmath9 .    using high quality single crystal niobium ,",
    "we have shown recently that nonlinear response to small external ac excitation field under stationary conditions , appears only in the surface superconducting state @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that in non - stationary conditions even non - linear effects appear also for @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of this nonlinear non - stationary response is orders of magnitude higher than the response observed under stationary conditions @xcite and , therefore , it will be referred to as `` a giant response '' .",
    "a rectangular sample , @xmath11 mm@xmath12 , was cut out high purity single crystalline nb ( @xmath13 k and resistance ratio @xmath14 ) .",
    "the results of magnetization measurements of our sample were published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the sample was exposed to dc @xmath15 and ac @xmath16 magnetic fields applied parallel to the [ 100 ] crystalline direction which coincides with the longest dimension of the rectangular sample .",
    "the amplitude modulated ac field @xmath17 , where : @xmath18 oe , @xmath19 , @xmath20 mhz , and @xmath21 hz , was obtained by feeding the small primary copper coil from a high frequency generator operating in a constant current regime .",
    "the detailed description of the experimental setup was given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "sweeping the dc magnetic field was achieved by a normal metal solenoid of a commercial squid magnetometer system .",
    "the maximum available amplitude of the field sweep was @xmath22 oe and sweep rate @xmath23 up to 24 oe / s .",
    "after reaching the maximum field at a given sweep rate , the field was decreased at the same sweep rate .",
    "the nonlinear response has been measured inductively by means of a secondary pick - up copper coil wound on the primary coil .",
    "nonlinearity of a superconducting specimen immersed in an amplitude modulated ac field results in oscillations of the magnetic moment at the frequencies of the harmonics of the fundamental frequency @xmath24 , and at the frequencies @xmath25 , as well as at the modulation frequency @xmath26 , and its harmonics .",
    "the pick - up coil transforms the oscillations of the magnetic moment into ac voltage signals .",
    "the signal was processed by a lock - in amplifier as a function of the experimental parameters such as : temperature , @xmath1 , dc , @xmath27 , and ac field amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "the nonlinear response to a dc magnetic field sweep , i.e. the amplitude of the rectified signal @xmath28 at the frequency @xmath26 , has been measured as follows .",
    "the sample was first cooled down to the required temperature at zero magnetic field .",
    "next , @xmath1 was raised to @xmath29 , the actual sweep of @xmath1 was ramped - up , and eventually @xmath28 was measured as a function of time . in the following we shall discuss only the phenomena associated with the increasing magnetic field sweep .",
    "the hysteretic behavior observed when the field was swept down will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "figure 1 shows the field dependence of the rectified signal @xmath30 measured at t=8.5 k for various @xmath29 values .",
    "both sweep rate and ac amplitude @xmath8 are constant .",
    "it is readily observed that for @xmath31 the response is negligible .",
    "however , for @xmath3 a slight increase in the signal appears . for @xmath15 close to @xmath5",
    "the magnitude of the response grows significantly , and exceeds the stationary response measured in the same setup with the same sample by two orders of magnitude@xcite .",
    "this result contradicts previous experimental observation @xcite and theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that in our experiments @xmath32 and therefore , in accordance with fink @xcite , @xmath33 should be zero .",
    "further increase of @xmath29 towards @xmath5 leads to a new phenomenon . rapidly increasing @xmath36 with a the maximum at @xmath37 sharply drops at @xmath38 . for @xmath39 @xmath36",
    "remains almost constant for any @xmath29 and then the signal gradually decreases to zero with @xmath1 approaching @xmath40 oe . at the same time",
    "all hysteretic phenomena disappear when @xmath41 .    the value of @xmath42 at which @xmath36 abruptly drops turned out to be strongly dependent on the experimental parameters such as @xmath29 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we have found that with decreasing the sweep rate and/or with increasing the excitation amplitude and starting field , the characteristic field @xmath42 asymptotically approaches @xmath5 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "2 shows the dependence of @xmath42 on sweep rate @xmath44 .",
    "the solid line is a best fit to @xmath45 .",
    "the experiments revealed that the amplitude of the rectified signal increases with @xmath27 .",
    "this dependence , determined for three different values of the @xmath1 , is presented in fig .",
    "the power law fit to the data shows that @xmath33 @xmath46 with the exponent @xmath47 .",
    "the exponent @xmath48 does not depend on temperature , @xmath8 and @xmath29 .",
    "however as @xmath15 approaches the field at which @xmath36 goes through a maximum , the exponent @xmath48 goes down , as illustrated in fig .  3 for @xmath49 oe , very close to the response maximum , fig .  1 .",
    "the discrepancy between the observed phenomena and previously reported results can be understood considering a sand pile analogue of a critical vortex state @xcite .",
    "slow increase of the dc field leads to an avalanche like vortex array redistribution .",
    "all previous experiments were performed at low frequencies at which any modifications of the nonlinear response due to vortex avalanches can not be observed since at low frequencies @xmath50 . at high frequencies",
    "vortex avalanches become effective .",
    "namely at high frequencies @xmath51 is possible .",
    "moreover , vortex avalanches occur in the entire volume of the sample and not only in the surface layer .",
    "the increase of the active volume may result in a significant enhancement of the nonlinear response .",
    "the proposed model may qualitatively explain the appearance near @xmath5 of a sharp drop of the rectified signal at @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear , that only a quantative theory will be able explain features observed experimentally in the present work .",
    "however , to the best our knowledge this theory does not exist as yet .",
