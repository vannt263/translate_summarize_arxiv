    "ss433 is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of @xmath17 days .",
    "the occultation of the relativistic component by the donor star occurs at the orbital phase @xmath18 .",
    "the structure of supercritical accretion discs was first described by @xcite . according to their concepts ,",
    "if the matter inflow rate at the outer boundary of the disc exceeds a critical value , the disc should have a typical size - scale @xmath19 , below which the supercritical properties of the disc begin to manifest themselves .",
    "this size is called the spherization radius and depends only on the accretion rate . for ss433 , @xmath20 cm . below the spherization radius ,",
    "the energy release in the disc reaches values at which the radiation pressure exceeds the gravity . a powerful outflow of matter in the form of jets and optically thick wind takes place in the supercritical region of the disc .",
    "this pattern is well confirmed by radiation - hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .    within the framework of the @xcite model , where the wind is formed below the spherization radius",
    ", we can assume that the wind in ss433 has the shape of a hollow cone and forms a wind funnel ( hereafter we refer to it as funnel ) .",
    "the study of eclipse depths in different energy ranges @xcite showed that the size of the outer boundary of the funnel ( or thick disc ) is approximately equal to the size of the donor - star and amounts to @xmath21 cm .",
    "depending on the precession phase @xmath22 an observer can see different depths inside the funnel . at the phase",
    "@xmath23 the disc is most open to the observer , and the angle between the funnel axis ( and jet ) and the line of sight reaches the maximum value @xmath24 @xcite . at those moments the optical spectrum is described by a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath25k @xcite . at the phases @xmath26",
    ", the disc is oriented edge - on , and the observer should not be able to see the funnel at all .",
    "+ the x - ray luminosity of ss433 is @xmath27erg / s @xcite , which is several orders of magnitude lower than its bolometric ( mostly uv ) luminosity @xmath28erg / s @xcite .",
    "the brightest object in the system is the supercritical accretion disc .",
    "obviously , all the energy is initially released in the x - ray range .",
    "however , it thermalizes in the powerful wind of the supercritical disc and emerges as uv radiation",
    ". it was assumed for a long time that all the observed x - ray radiation originates in the jets . in the papers by @xcite ( exosat ) , @xcite ( asca ) , @xcite ( chandra ) , and @xcite ( rxte ) , the authors developed a ` standard ' cooling jet model and found the jet parameters . in particular",
    ", @xcite obtained the following parameters : jet base temperature @xmath29k and opening angle @xmath30 .",
    "the opening of the x - ray jets is equal to that of the optical jets  @xcite .",
    "the typical radiative time - scale of x - ray jets is about one hundred seconds , whereas the radiative time for optical jets is 13 days @xcite .",
    "the opening angle of the x - ray jets is determined by the speed of sound in the place where they emerge from the funnel and begin to cool , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the jet temperature subsequently drops , and the jet opening freezes and changes no longer .",
    "an analysis of the new data from the xmm - newton observatory showed that the standard jet model can not explain the observed x - ray spectrum , and that an additional hard component in required @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed the xmm - newton spectra ( in the 0.212kev range ) in more detail and isolated three components .",
    "( i )  jet emission .",
    "the jet continuum emission dominates in the 1.55kev range ; there is also a significant contribution in the iron and nickel lines in the vicinity of 78kev .",
    "( ii )  reflected emission .",
    "it is assumed that the funnel walls can see directly the bottom of the funnel and the hard radiation of the central engine .",
    "they reflect this radiation outwards .",
    "the reflected radiation dominates in the range of @xmath32kev .",
    "( iii )  the soft ( @xmath33 kev ) thermal component   presumably the inherent radiation of the funnel walls .",
    "@xcite proposed an idea that if different emission components of ss433 originate in different spatially separated regions , the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) should exhibit a shift caused by the time lag between these components . @xcite and @xcite investigated the correlations between x - rays ( 320kev ) and the optical range .",
    "they suggested that the x - ray emission is formed in the jets , whereas optical emission is formed at the outer parts of the funnel s wall due to the thermal reprocessing of hard radiation , which is formed in the inner parts of the supercritical accretion disc and ends up on the funnel walls .",
    "if this is the case , one can expect a shift to exist between the x - ray emission of the jet ( 25kev ) and the funnel ( @xmath32kev ) .",
    "the correlation between different x - ray ranges has not been studied so far , although , presently , a lot of new data are emerging , allowing such a study to be carried out .    another approach to",
    "the study of funnel parameters is investigating the aperiodic variability of ss433 .",
    "@xcite constructed broad - band power density spectra ( pds ) in the @xmath34@xmath35hz frequency range based on the data of optical , x - ray ( exosat / me and rxte / asm ) and radio observations .",
    "these authors suggested the idea that at the frequencies higher than @xmath36hz , pds should become steeper due to the smearing out of variability in the funnel , and the position of the break in the power spectrum can be used to estimate the funnel size .",
    "pds of ss433 in the visible were studied in the frequency range of @xmath37  hz and higher @xcite .",
    "thus , the nature of rapid variability , as well as the form of the observed ccfs and pds should depend on the properties of the funnel and relativistic jets . at present",
    ", there are enough optical and x - ray ( from the rxte observatory ) data accumulated to perform a more detailed and complete analysis of these unique structures in the accretion disc of ss433 .",
    "the available data cover a full range of precession phases and have high signal - to - noise ratios , which allows to study the dependence of the form of the ccfs and pds on disc orientation , model the observed pds in detail , and estimate the funnel parameters .",

    "the observations were reduced using the heasoft6.11 package .",
    "we used the data of ` good xenon ' mode .",
    "we tried to obtain the longest and most homogeneous light curves for each data set . in earlier observations",
    ", all 5 pca detectors would usually operate . during the later observations , pcu1 , pcu3 and pcu4",
    "were periodically turned on and off due to a high voltage breakdowns .",
    "that is why we selected the good - time - intervals ( gti ) so as to use only the detectors that operated for a maximum length of time during the observations ( table  [ tab : data_xray ] , column 3 ) .",
    "in addition , the pcu0 detector that had lost the propane veto layer was excluded from consideration when reducing the observations made after the year 2000 .",

    "the difference between the two systems was equal to 64.184 seconds .",
    "this difference has been taken into account ( see `` time tutorial '' ) .",
    "the study of the power spectra of ss433 shows that its aperiodic variability is similar to the variability of the majority of galactic x - ray sources and has a red noise nature @xcite , i.e. , its amplitude increases with increasing characteristic time - scales .",
    "the pds averaged over the precession phases are well fitted by a power law @xmath52 with the exponent @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "however , a more detailed investigation of the power spectra , and in particular , their variation with the precession phase , allows one to find out more about the structure of the supercritical accretion disc of ss433 .",
    "from the characteristic time - scales and the pds slopes , we can estimate the size and opening angle of the wind funnel of the accretion disc .        to compute the pds we extracted light curves with a 10-second temporal resolution . because the number of used detectors is varied , the light curves were normalized to this number .",
    "the light curves were then divided into intervals .",
    "each interval was used to compute separate pds , which were then averaged .",
    "rxte operates in low orbit with a period of about 1.5 hours , and all observations have significant gaps caused by the occultation of the object by the earth , and also by the passage of rxte through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "unfortunately , even in the best - case scenario , the total fraction of the gaps amounts to no less than 40% .",
    "it was important to us to keep the low frequencies in the pds , and therefore , we could not limit the length of the interval only to the unocculted ( @xmath54s ) parts of the light curves .",
    "we used then the 1024 bin ( @xmath55ks ) intervals and omitted those where the fraction of gaps exceeds 50% . to compute the pds",

    "they are marked in table  [ tab : data_xray ] by the `` @xmath56 '' sign .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds_data ] we show the 220kev x - ray pds for the first , second , and fourth precession phase groups .",
    "the third group does not have observations long enough to compute the pds .",
    "the pds corresponding to the maximum opening of the funnel ( group i ) has an obvious break in the vicinity of @xmath57hz .",
    "as the funnel visibility conditions deteriorate for the observer ( group ii ) , the break becomes less conspicuous   the pds gradually changes its slope in the vicinity of the break .",

    "the spectral index asymptotically tends to @xmath63 at @xmath64 , and to @xmath65 at @xmath66 . at frequencies less than the break frequency @xmath67",
    ", the pds is almost flat .",
    "this result does not agree with the index 1.5 found earlier by @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the slope of the pds may be distorted by the so - called power leakage ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect 6.1.3 and 7.5 ) , which may arise due to occasional gaps in the observations . to check whether the flat region of the pds is due to the influence of the gaps , we used the following monte carlo method",
    ". @xcite describe an algorithm of generating synthetic light curves with a given power spectrum using the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the measured power values @xmath68 are scattered around the real @xmath69 , and obey the @xmath70 distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , by assigning to each harmonic a random phase , we can generate synthetic light curves , i.e. , realizations of a random process with the required statistical characteristics and pds .         using this algorithm",
    ", we specified a reference pds , generated a large number ( @xmath71 ) of synthetic light curves , superimposed a gap pattern present in the real observations , applied identical breaking into intervals and computed the synthetic light curves . by comparing the discrepancies between the reference pds and the synthetic one computed using the monte carlo method",
    ", we can estimate the degree of distortion due to the gaps . as reference power spectra we used the one described by formula ( [ eq : pds_knee ] ) and a single power - law pds with the index 1.67 , which well approximates the @xmath72 frequency range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pds_flatnessproff ] ) .    as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : pds_flatnessproff ] , the presence of gaps does not lead to the appearance of a flat region in the single power - law pds . in the broken power - law model a systematic underestimation of power",
    "is observed only at the frequency @xmath73hz .",
    "otherwise there are no differences between the reference and synthetic pds .",
    "thus , the flat region at low frequencies in the pds is not an artifact , and corresponds to the real processes in the ss433 accretion disc .    for the maximum opening of the funnel and edge - on phases ,",
    "we separately show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds_data_g1g4 ] pds in the 25kev ( the maximum jet emission ) and 820kev ( the maximum funnel emission ) ranges . as is evident from the figure ,",
    "there are no essential differences between the pds in these two ranges .",
    "they both have the same shape typical of their groups",
    ". however , the pds in the soft range is systematically lower .",
    "this indicates that the variability of emission in the soft and hard ranges has the same nature , but the amplitude of variability ( in percent ) is smaller in the soft range .",
    "we found that the power spectrum corresponding to the open disc is practically flat at the low frequencies , and has a break at the frequency @xmath74hz , above which the slope is substantially steep ( 1.67 ) .",
    "the presence of a break in the pds can be explained by the smearing out of variability in the funnel @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the variable hard x - ray emission is generated in the innermost parts of the accretion disc , inaccessible for direct observations .",
    "an observer can see only the reflected emission .",
    "the signals reflected from the outer and inner parts of the funnel walls should be delayed relative to each other by the typical time @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the size of the funnel and @xmath77 is the speed of light .",
    "a superposition of these signals should result in the effective suppression of variability at times shorter than @xmath78 and the appearance of a break in the power spectrum .",
    "the particular shape of the observed pds   the position of the break and the slope at high frequencies   should depend on the geometry of the funnel .",
    "we modeled the pds shape depending on the funnel s geometry . in our model ,",
    "the funnel of the supercritical accretion disc is represented by an opaque cone with an opening angle @xmath79 ( the angle between the wall and the axis ) and a funnel wall length @xmath76 .",
    "the source of emission is point - like and located at the apex of the cone .",
    "we defined a coordinate system @xmath80 at the surface of the cone .",
    "we assumed that the illumination in each point of the cone is inversely proportional to the squared distance from the point source , and that the albedo is the same in all points .",
    "then the radiation flux reflected in the direction of the observer by the surface element @xmath81 with radius vector @xmath82 is : @xmath83 where a is the surface albedo and @xmath84 is the angle between the normal to the surface and the direction towards the observer .",
    "the smearing out of variability is described by the response function @xmath85 , which shows how the funnel with the given parameters reacts to an instant flare that occurred in the center of the accretion disc at time @xmath86 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the function @xmath89 describes the lag of the beam reflected by the element with the coordinates @xmath80 .",
    "integration is done over the inner cone surface visible to the observer .",
    "the delay function @xmath90 and the visible surface area @xmath91 depend not only on the parameters of the cone , but also on its orientation with respect to the observer ( on the angle @xmath42 between the line of sight and the funnel axis ) . in all our computations we adopted @xmath92 , which corresponds to the most long observation , which contributed the most to the power spectrum of group  i ( table  [ tab : data_xray ] ) .",
    "the normalization @xmath93 was chosen in such a way so that the area underneath the response function would be equal to one .",
    "we computed the response functions for different values of the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath79 and found that the length of the funnel affects mainly the duration of the response , whereas the opening angle influences both the duration and steepness of the decline . in fig .",
    "[ fig : funnel_response ] we show the response functions for different opening angles .",
    "all the functions have a characteristic shape with a sharp rise in the beginning and a long decline in the end .",
    "this is due to the fact that light reaches the deeper and , therefore , brighter regions of the funnel with the least delay .",
    "these deeper regions contribute the most to the response functions and correspond to the fast rise in the beginning .",
    "the peripheral areas of the funnel are reached by light after a longer delay .",

    "that is why the maximum of the response functions is higher for large angles , and the decline is steeper . in the opening angle limit",
    "@xmath98 , degeneration occurs and the response function turns into a @xmath88-function , because the central source , which is much brighter than the funnel walls , becomes visible to the observer .",
    "using the response functions we modeled the pds . since the effect of smearing out of variability in the funnel manifests itself at frequencies higher than the break frequency , we adopted that in the @xmath99 frequency range the slope of the pds is @xmath100 as it was found from observations .",
    "we suppose that the flat pds is an intrinsic property of the innermost parts of ss433 accretion disc ( see sec .",

    "the slight influence of the angle on the position of the break is due to the change in the path difference between the beams reflected by the central and peripheral regions of the funnel .    as the opening angle increases ,",
    "the power spectrum becomes flatter , and the sensitivity to the value of the angle increases . in the @xmath98 limit , the slope of the power spectrum at high and low frequencies evens out , because the central source becomes visible . in this case",

    "this angle is very close to @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "that is why the reflected emission flux becomes inversely proportional to the cube of the distance to the source @xmath108 .",
    "substituting the second power by the third influences the form of the response functions .",

    "the funnel length increases , whereas the opening decreases .",
    "taking into account the other effects , e.g. , the scattering of the radiation in the semi - transparent gas filling the funnel , should yield the same result ( the cubic dependence ) .    in the case of multiple scattering inside the funnel ,",
    "the time of the propagation of variability is determined mostly by the last scattering in the outer parts of the funnel . this will not strongly change the result of our estimation of the opening and size of the funnel .",

    "good rxte sensitivity in the 220kev range allows studying both the variability of the jets and of the harder emission .",

    "gaussian analysis of the group  i ccf for these two intervals shows that there are three characteristic time - scales at @xmath129 , @xmath133 and @xmath134  s having the fwhm of 20 , 50 and 150  s , respectively .",
    "the soft emission lags are possibly related to the fact that it originates mainly in the jets moving with the velocity of @xmath135 , whereas the hard component is the emission reflected by the funnel wall .",
    "the idea that a lag should exist between the jet component and the reflected emission was first proposed by @xcite .",

    "such a behaviour is consistent with the idea of @xcite that the optical emission is generated due to the thermal reprocessing on the funnel walls .",
    "apparently , the hard emission formed in deepest regions of the funnel is partly reflected and partly reprocessed into the optical range in the outer regions of the funnel .",
    "so it could be possible that the hard x - ray and the optical emissions are formed in the same place and therefore reach the observer about simultaneously .",
    "that is why the correlation functions between the soft and hard x - rays and between soft x - rays and the optical appear practically identical ( fig .",

    "the 300 sec delay of optical emission might be related to the heating effects of the funnel wall by the hard emission which appears at these time - scales .",

    "[ fig : xray+xray2 ] .                  in this section",
    "we discuss an additional ( or alternative ) explanation of the ccfs which is based on the cooling of the relativistic jets .",
    "spectral studies of the jets show that the temperature at the visible jet base is @xmath142  kev @xcite .",
    "the gas of the jets cools due to expansion and radiative losses .",
    "the 25  kev range contains most of the jet emission , but a certain portion should also be emitted in the 820  kev range . in this case , both in the hard and soft range , we should see the emission of the same clouds ( blobs ) , which make up the jets .",
    "a jet moving towards us is much brighter than the one moving away and contributes more to the total flux ; in addition , the receding jet may be partially obscured from the observer by the wind @xcite .",
    "therefore , the light curves in the two ranges should be similar and well correlated with each other .",
    "the ccf asymmetry in this case is related to the fact that as the jet cools , the hard - range flux should weaken faster than in the soft range .",
    "having modeled the cooling of the jet gas , one can try to reproduce the shape of the ccfs .",
    "in our model we assumed that the jet consists of spherical blobs , which are shot out from the inner parts of the accretion disc with a given time - scale .",
    "the blobs are optically thin , and are dominated by bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the volume emission coefficient may be written in the following form ( * ? ? ?",

    "depending on the conditions in the jet , different cooling mechanisms may be realized .",

    "they therefore could have approximately constant sizes , because the pressure of the external medium would prevent their expansion . in this case",
    ", the cooling occurs due to radiative losses . if the external medium is absent or its pressure is not enough to constrain the expansion , the cooling is possible both due to radiative losses and expansion .",
    "depending on the density of the blob , one or other mechanism prevails .",

    "[ fig : jetmodel_temp ] shows the time dependences of temperature for these two models .",

    "we can introduce the typical cooling times @xmath163 ( [ eq : te_rad ] ) and @xmath164 ( [ eq : te_ad ] ) .",
    "they are e - fold times which depend on the initial temperature and density of the blob .",

    "the flux shows a steeper decline in the hard range compared to the soft range , both in the radiative and adiabatic cases .",
    "moreover , in the radiative model , the flux profiles in the hard and soft ranges differ significantly from each other .",
    "while the temperature is sufficiently hot , the soft range flux remains practically unchanged .",

    "we were able to reproduce the asymmetry of the observed ccfs .",
    "the asymmetry is more conspicuous in the radiative cooling model than in the adiabatic model .",
    "this is due , mainly , to the difference between the flux decrease rates in the soft and hard ranges in the radiative model mentioned above .",

    "the jet model can explain even the amplitude difference between the hard and soft x - ray pds ( fig .",

    "the optical jet luminosity is comparable to x - ray one but it is emitted in the lines of hydrogen @xcite , and this emission is generated at considerably greater distances from the system ( @xmath185  cm ) .",
    "the jet optical lines are appeared due to the dynamic interaction of the jet clouds with the gas of the surrounding wind .",
    "the optical pds @xcite are very similar to those in x - rays obtained by us , they also exhibit a break .",
    "this task is well handled by the funnel model @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the optical pds found by @xcite and averaged over all observations ( precession phases ) are the following : the power - law index at low frequencies @xmath186 , at high frequencies @xmath187 , the break frequency @xmath188  hz ( equation  [ eq : pds_knee ] ) .",
    "our modelling of this pds from @xcite yields the funnel wall length @xmath189  cm and opening angle @xmath190 .",
    "optical power spectra are steeper than those in x - rays , and therefore the accuracy of the determination of angle @xmath79 is lower , @xmath191 .",

    "their parameters are : @xmath192 and @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , @xmath196  hz and @xmath197  hz , respectively .",
    "the break frequency for these two individual pds is 1.5 times higher than the mean value .",
    "accordingly , individual observations yield smaller funnel sizes",
    ". we may estimate that in the jet direction the funnel size is @xmath198  cm which is comparable with donor star and the thick disc size @xcite .",
    "we can conclude from the above that both mechanisms contribute to the observed fast variability of ss433 .",
    "whereas in the optical range variability must be determined only by the funnel , in the x - rays we see both the manifestation of the funnel and the jets .",
    "the x - ray light curves are a sum of two varying signals : the light curve of the jets and the light curve of the funnel .",
    "moreover , each of these signals has its own nature of variability and power spectrum .",
    "the smearing out of variability in the funnel is determined by its geometry and has to be the same in x - rays and optical .",
    "we can therefore expect that in the x - rays the intrinsic power spectrum of the funnel is a roughly similar to the observed optical pds .",
    "it follows from a comparison of the x - ray and optical power spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pds_data ] here and fig.6 in @xcite ) that the variability amplitude in the optical is lower than that in the x - rays . at the frequencies",
    "@xmath199  hz , the amplitude in the optical is lower by one order of magnitude .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the funnel itself is a less variable source than the x - ray jets .",
    "we conclude that the observed x - ray pds is , for the most part , the pds of the jets , since the funnel should contribute considerably less to the x - ray variability .",
    "nonetheless , we have seen that the contribution from the funnel shows up in the ccfs between the x - rays and optical ( figs .",
    "[ fig : xray+optics],[fig : xray+bta ] ) .",
    "thus , the observed variability of ss433 can be explained only by the combined effect of two mechanisms : the cooling of the x - ray jets and the smearing out of variability in the inner parts of the funnel in the wind of the supercritical accretion disc .      in the precession phases",
    "when the disc is observed edge - on , we see a fundamentally different picture . the pds ( fig .",

    ", even the least dense fraction manages to cool down to @xmath204  kev . at such temperature",
    ", the flux from the jets should be 10 times weaker in the 25  kev range and 60 times weaker in the 820  kev range than during the phase when the observer can see the funnel to maximum depth .",
    "the contribution of the jets to the observed x - ray flux should therefore be negligibly small for the edge - on disc. the fact that the observer does not see the jets during this precession phase is confirmed by the absence of a correlation between the soft and hard emission ( figs .",

    "@xcite , based on the rxte / asm and ginga data , and also @xcite , based on the rxte / pca data , found that during the ` edge - on ' precession phase the flux in the standard x - ray range is only 2 times smaller than at the phase of maximal opening of the funnel .",

    "their power spectra were constructed based on the exosat / me data , which are more noisy than the rxte / pca data used by us .",
    "the formation of a power - law spectrum in ss433 is related to the fluctuations of viscosity in the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the formation of power - law pds due to random fluctuations of the viscosity parameter @xmath241 was described in detail by  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the fluctuations are small and occur independently at different disc radii .",
    "their typical time - scale should be of the order of the viscous time , or a time of matter propagation through the disc @xcite : @xmath242^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath243 is the thickness of the disc at a given radius , and @xmath244 is the keplerian angular velocity . at a larger time - scales the fluctuations of @xmath241 become independent at each radius .",
    "the further from the disc center , the greater the typical time - scale of the fluctuations .",
    "viscosity fluctuations in a ring of radius @xmath245 should in turn lead to perturbations of the accretion rate in the given ring . as matter passes through the disc ,",
    "these perturbations accumulate , i.e. , at every radius , the disc remembers all the fluctuations that occurred in the outer parts of the disc .",
    "therefore , when matter reaches the inner disc radius , where the maximum energy release takes place , it bears information about the perturbations that occurred at every radius and time - scale",
    ". @xcite showed that in this case , a power - law pds should be observed , the slope of which should be determined by the amplitude of the variations of @xmath241 at different radii .",
    "in particular , if the variation amplitude is the same at all radii , the power spectrum should be @xmath246 .",
    "a continuous power - law power spectrum should be observed only if all the terms in equation  ( [ eq : time_visc ] ) vary smoothly with radius . in the case of a supercritical accretion disc ,",
    "this is not so .",
    "according to @xcite , a supercritical disc should possess a special radius @xmath19   the spherization radius , below which the supercritical - disc properties begin to manifest themselves , and the structure of the disc changes abruptly .",
    "@xmath247 where @xmath14 is the eddington accretion rate and @xmath248 is the inner disc radius . at distances @xmath249 ,",
    "the radiation pressure is greater than gravity .",
    "the disc becomes geometrically thick with @xmath10 .",

    "in addition , the viscosity ( @xmath241 ) in the supercritical region may differ from that in the standard disc .",
    "direct numerical simulations could answer this question .",

    "the flat region in fig .  [ fig : pds_data ] ( @xmath271  hz ) falls within that frequency range .",
    "we do not have observations long enough to study the pds at the frequencies below @xmath37  hz .",

    "the observer sees the emission reflected from the funnel walls , and the intrinsic jet emission .",
    "these processes distort the original pds of ss433 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : funnel_model ] ) .",
    "in particular , due to both the scattering in the funnel and the jet cooling , a break appears at @xmath232  hz ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pds_data],[fig : pds_results ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to study the shape , slope , and breaks at @xmath274  hz in an undistorted pds of the supercritical disc of ss433 .",
    "however , we believe that the power spectra of other objects with supercritical accretion ( ulxs   ultraluminous x - ray sources are the most likely candidates ) , where the observer sees the innermost regions of the funnel @xcite , should have extensive flat regions , spreading over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "we analyzed a rapid x - ray variability of ss433 based on the rxte data in the @xmath0hz frequency range .",
    "the shape of the cross - correlation functions and power spectra depends drastically on the system s precession phase . at the phase corresponding to the maximal opening of the funnel of the supercritical disc , the pds has a quasi - flat region with a power - law index of @xmath275 ; at the frequency @xmath1  hz , a break appears , above which the pds has an index of @xmath276 . the pds corresponding to the ` edge - on ' phase , when the observer can not see the funnel , exhibits neither a flat region nor a break .",
    "a single power - law with the index @xmath200 is observed at all frequencies .",
    "the ccfs of the x - ray emission in the 25kev and 820kev ranges have a complex profile with a pronounced asymmetry indicating a lag of the soft emission behind the hard emission at times ranging from several to 250 seconds .",
    "gaussian analysis allows to distinguish three components in the profile , with fwhm of 20 , 50 , and 150  s and typical delays of 5 , 25 , and 45 s , respectively .",
    "this effect is most conspicuous at maximal opening of the funnel , and it disappears at the ` edge - on ' orientations .",
    "the data of simultaneous rxte and optical observations has shown that the soft x - rays also lag behind the optical , but the hard x - rays reach the observer simultaneously with the optical .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray and optical variability of ss433 is fully determined by the visibility of the funnel in the supercritical accretion disc .",
    "the delay of soft x - ray emission relative to the hard and optical emission is consistent with the idea @xcite that the soft emission is generated mostly in the jets but the hard emission is reflected at the outer funnel walls and the optical emission is a result of reprocession of the hard x - rays .",
    "we investigated two mechanisms that may explain the observed variability of ss433 , 1 ) reflection and scattering of emission in the wind funnel of the supercritical disc ( the funnel model , applicable both to x - ray and optical emission ) and 2 ) the cooling of the jet gas ( jet model , applicable only to x - ray emission ) .",
    "both models well reproduce the position of the break and the slope at high frequencies in the x - ray power spectrum corresponding to the phase of maximal opening of the funnel .",
    "optical emission of ss433 can not be formed in the jets , and therefore optical variability is determined fully by the funnel .",
    "modelling of optical pds yields the following estimates of the funnel parameters : the funnel wall length @xmath277  cm , and opening angle @xmath5 . modelling of x - ray power spectra results in similar quantities .",
    "we believe that unlike the optical , the x - ray variability is determined by the contribution of both mechanisms ( funnel and jet ) ; moreover , the contribution of the jets to the x - ray variability is significantly greater .",
    "it also follows from a comparison of the variability amplitudes of x - rays and optical pds that the jets are a more variable source than the funnel .",
    "our modelling of x - ray ccfs and pds in the cooling x - ray jet model showed that the jets may consist of three fractions of clouds with different densities : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 , and most of the jet mass is concentrated in the last fraction .    in the ` edge - on ' precession phase , when both the jets and the funnel are obscured by the wind",
    ", the observer sees a significant x - ray flux .",
    "the unobscured , cooled outer parts of the jets can not provide the observed x - ray flux .",
    "it was suggested that the clouds of the jet and the wind , which ` see ' the funnel directly , should scatter a part of the funnel s emission .",
    "we have found that the pds observed at the ` edge - on ' can indeed be reproduced if the emission is scattered on the extensive gaseous structures located above the funnel at distances up to @xmath278  cm .    at the precession phase when the funnel is maximally open to the observer , the pds of ss433 exhibit a flat part in the @xmath279hz frequency range .",
    "we argue that the presence of such a part is related to the abrupt change in the disc structure and the viscous time at the spherization radius . in this place",
    "the accretion disc becomes thick @xmath10 , which reduces drastically the time of passage of matter through the disc .",
    "the position of the flat part in the pds depends on the mass of the black hole , accretion rate and viscosity in the disc , however , its extent ( 2 - 3 orders of magnitude in frequency ) depends only on the change in viscosity between subcritical and supercritical regions .",
    "simple estimates of the position of the flat part in ss433 yield a @xmath280  hz interval .",
    "the observed flat portion in ss433 really is located within this interval .",
    "however , as we have seen , the funnel and the cooling jets smooth out the variability at high frequencies ; a break at @xmath1  hz is observed in the pds . at the frequencies",
    "@xmath281  hz , the power spectrum should again become power - law - like ( this was shown by @xcite ) .",
    "we can not see the whole flat part in ss433 , and therefore , can not analyze the higher frequencies which would be determined by the flow of matter below the spherization radius .",
    "however one may expect that flat parts should be observed in other supercritical accretion discs , and in particular , in ultraluminous x - ray sources .",
