    "in a small and highly urbanized nation like singapore dengue outbreaks or epidemics are identified as `` clusters '' .",
    "a dengue * cluster * or focus of transmission is defined as at least two confirmed cases , with no recent travel history , that are located within 200 m of each other ( taken as the flight range of the _ aedes aegypti _ ) and whose dates of the onset of symptoms are within three weeks of each other  @xcite .",
    "some efforts have been directed towards the characterization of sis models of infections , or epidemics without immunization  @xcite , that is the state of the particles are healthy or infected , and are susceptible to re - infection after healing , thus the name of the model ( sis : susceptible - infected - susceptible ) .",
    "analytical and numerical expressions describe the dynamics of the @xmath0 model in terms of the rate of spreading @xmath1 , the evolution of the survival probability of infection @xmath2 , the mean number of infected agents @xmath3 and the mean square distance of spreading @xmath4 in time , which are quantities difficult to compare with real data of epidemics .",
    "this work suggests an application of potential comparison with public health data , analyzing a scaling function for * clusters numbers * on a @xmath5 model of infection .",
    "+ the second important ingredient of this work is the mobility of agents , contrasted to most of the models of epidemy where the population is modeled by static networks  @xcite . in a previous work  @xcite",
    "we showed that the @xmath5 model of infection on a system of mobile agents has critical exponents which depends on the density of the system , i.e spatial correlations and mobility of the agents play an important role .",
    "we obtained a crossover from mean field behavior for low densities to static @xmath6-lattices for higher densities .",
    "here we use our model of mobile agents to define clusters of infections and analyze its dependency on the rate of infection @xmath1 ( defined in detail bellow ) and on the mobility of the agents .",
    "+ we propose a time - evolving network model : a link between two moving agents is created when they collide with each other and there is transmission of the infection among them ( i.e through infected - susceptible interactions ) , the link lasts a characteristic time of infection .",
    "+ we find that the network of clusters of infections remains disconnected and no matter how large the rate of infection , no giant cluster is formed .",
    "we show that in the transition to spreading , the moments of the cluster size distribution are described by an exponent @xmath7 , which is the exponent that characterizes the fraction of infected mass @xmath8 , defined as the ratio of the number of infected agents ( @xmath9 ) and the total amount of population ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus the number of clusters depends on @xmath1 , and mobility and spatial correlation of the agents influence its dependency .",
    "@xmath10 soft disks , with radius @xmath11 , represent agents which move in a two dimensional cell of linear size @xmath12 , with density @xmath13 .",
    "the system has periodic boundary conditions and is initialized as follows : the agents are placed in the cell with the same velocity modulus @xmath14 and randomly distributed directions , positions and states : infected or susceptible. if a susceptible agent @xmath15 collides with an infected agent @xmath16 ( i.e @xmath17 ) , then @xmath15 becomes infected .",
    "each infected agent heals and becomes susceptible again after a fixed number of time steps , called the time of infection ( @xmath18 ) , which is a free parameter of the model .",
    "+ the physical interaction of the agents is modeled by molecular dynamic with a leap - frog integration method @xcite , the interaction potential is a @xmath19 lennard - jones truncated potential ( see more details in @xcite ) .",
    "+ the resulting model is a contact process  @xcite , where the infected species become extinct unless the infection spreads rapidly enough .",
    "the transition between survival and extinction depends on a critical rate of spreading @xmath20 that marks the transition into an absorbing state . the infection rate @xmath1 is defined as the number of agents one agent infects before healing . for this system ,",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is the characteristic time of flight between two collisions , which is determined by the density ( @xmath23 ) and the mean velocity of agents ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the critical exponents of the transition to spreading were presented by us for the same kind of system  @xcite , where the study was done in terms of the fraction of infected individuals ( @xmath25 ) . here",
    "we go further and characterize the behavior of the clusters of infected individuals .",
    "when agent @xmath16 infects agent @xmath15 a link is created among them , the link lasts until one of them heals , meanwhile each of them continues making links with other susceptible agents through the same rule .",
    "a cluster is thus defined as a group of infected agents connected by links .",
    "note that in contrast to percolation , where clusters are given by occupied lattice sites connected by nearest - neighbor distances , for this model each cluster gives a group of agents infected in a given period of time linked by a relation of contagion .",
    "isolated infected agents are regarded as clusters of size unity and any cluster consisting of @xmath26 connected agents is an @xmath27 .",
    "we borrow the notation from stauffer s book on percolation theory  @xcite and define here @xmath28 as the number of @xmath26-clusters per agent , where @xmath29 is the number of clusters of size @xmath26 and @xmath10 the total number of agents in the system . for different values of @xmath1 , in the next section we present the results of the calculation of the first three moments of the cluster size distribution .",
    "namely : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "those quantities give us , respectively , information about : the total number of clusters , the fraction of infected agents and the mean size of clusters . in order to keep the analogy with the calculation on percolation , we sum over all values of @xmath26 excluding the largest cluster ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we also present , the calculations of @xmath34 , the fraction of agents that belong to the largest cluster and @xmath35 , the fraction of agents that are infected .",
    "for a fixed density , we vary @xmath1 ( eq .  [ eq : lambda ] ) changing the time of infection ( @xmath18 ) . starting with half of the population infected , for rate of infections near @xmath20 , a given trial may end into the absorbing state after a few time steps or it may _ survive _ fluctuating with a quasi - stationary fraction of infected agents , marked with windows in the left - side of fig  [ fig1 ] . the calculations are made averaging on time at the _ quasi - stationary state _ , which is described by the surviving trials following an initial transient .",
    "the number of time steps of this transient depends on @xmath1 and on the system size @xmath12 ( see left side of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the data here illustrate how the mean fraction of infected agents @xmath36 ( the superscript denotes an average restricted to surviving trials ) approaches its stationary value @xmath37 ( in the following , we write @xmath37 just like @xmath38 . in the right side of the same figure we see the graph of @xmath39 , which becomes sharper increasing the system size .",
    "we analyze in detail the number of clusters for the two density values @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which have critical rate of spreading @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "note that at the critical density @xmath44 , surviving trials tend to stationary values only in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "+ the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is only for pedagogical reasons , in order to illustrate how the number of clusters looks in the quasi - stationary state , we see snapshots of the clusters of infections for _ different _ systems densities and the _ same _ rate of infection @xmath46 , here @xmath47 . +    for @xmath40 and @xmath48 $ ] , the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the variation of @xmath39 and @xmath49 averaged over @xmath50 different realizations .",
    "the insets show the change in time of @xmath51 and @xmath30 , for only one realization with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast to percolation results , in this model there is no significant variation of @xmath51 with @xmath1 , and the relation @xmath55 remains .",
    "moreover , the number of clusters @xmath30 grows considerably only near @xmath20 .    .",
    "[ fig3 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we plot the behavior of the cluster numbers near their respective @xmath20 .",
    "as the largest cluster remains small compared to the total number of agents ( @xmath56 ) , we have @xmath57.additionally one can see that @xmath31 and @xmath58 show the same critical behavior as @xmath39 , plotted in detail in fig .",
    "we observe that all the moments of the cluster size distribution present exactly the same critical behavior than @xmath25 , namely @xmath59 , where @xmath7 depends on the density of the system .",
    "this work showed that the cluster size distribution of infected individuals is described in terms of the spreading rate ( @xmath1 ) and the same exponents ( @xmath7 ) previously known for the total mass of infection .",
    "although the agents are free to move there is a homogeneous size distribution of infected clusters at the critical rate of infection , and we did not find any critical exponent associated with the cluster sizes . comparing with the traditional @xmath5 model on a static network",
    "we confirm that mobility and spatial correlations change the value of the critical exponent @xmath7 of the fraction of infected population , and to the same extent the cluster size distribution of infection .",
