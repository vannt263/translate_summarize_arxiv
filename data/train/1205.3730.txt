    "<S> we use polarized inelastic neutron scattering to study low - energy spin excitations and their spatial anisotropy in electron - overdoped superconducting bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 ( @xmath3 k ) . in the normal state , the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility , @xmath4 , at the antiferromagnetic ( af ) wave vector @xmath5 increases linearly with energy for @xmath6 mev . upon entering the superconducting state </S>",
    "<S> , a spin gap opens below @xmath7 mev and a broad neutron spin resonance appears at @xmath8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> our careful neutron polarization analysis reveals that @xmath4 is isotropic for the in - plane and out - of - plane components in both the normal and superconducting states . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of these results with those of undoped bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 and optimally electron - doped bafe@xmath10ni@xmath11as@xmath2 ( @xmath12 k ) suggests that the spin anisotropy observed in bafe@xmath10ni@xmath11as@xmath2 is likely due to its proximity to the undoped bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the neutron spin resonance is isotropic in the overdoped regime , consistent with a singlet to triplet excitation . </S>"
