    "hybrid systems consisting of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) inside optical cavities exhibit by themselves optomechanical proprties @xcite .",
    "the excitation of a collective mode of bec couples to the radiation pressure of the cavity optical field just like what happens for the moving mirror in a bare optomechanical system @xcite .",
    "one of the most important features of such systems is their nonlinear proprties like the kerr effect @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite that a cross - kerr ( ck ) type of coupling between the moving mirror and the optical field can be realized in a bare optomechanical cavity which is coupled to a josephson junction .",
    "the ck nonlinearity leads to a frequency shift in both the mechanical and optical modes@xcite and also affects the stability of the optomechanical system @xcite .",
    "in addition , it can change the optical bistability of the optomechanical system into a tristable behavior @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "a hybrid system consisting of a bec traped inside an optical cavity exhibits an intrinsic ck nonlinearity if the cavity is driven by a laser pump which is far detuned from the atomic resonance . in spite of bare optomechanical systems , in such hybrid systems",
    "there is no need to use any aditional component ( like the josephson junction ) to generate the ck coupling because here the ck nonlinearity emerges naturally due to the direct interaction between the atoms and the optical field of the cavity .",
    "in fact , there exist two kinds of coupling between the bogoliubov mode of the bec and the optical field : the radiation pressure and the ck coupling .",
    "however , the ratio of the ck to the optomechanical coupling is of the order of @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of atoms .",
    "therefore , in many cases @xcite one can neglect the ck term in comparison to the radiation pressure interaction .",
    "that is why we have also not considered the effect of this term on the dynamics of the system in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "in addition to the radiation pressure and ck nonlinearities , there is another kind of nonlinearity which is due to the atom - atom interaction in the bec which may lead to some interesting phenomena such as the quantum phase transition @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we are going to investigate under which conditions and in which regimes the effect of ck nonlinearity manifest itself in a hybrid system consisting of a bec traped inside an optical cavity .",
    "we show that it can change the optical bistability behavior of the system specially when the driving rate of the optical cavity is increased .",
    "it is also shown that the effective frequency of the bogoliubov mode of the bec depends on the mean value of the optical mode through the ck coupling so that the bogoliubov mode frequency gets larger by increasing the number of intracavity photons .",
    "this is one of the main results of our investigation .",
    "moreover , we show that the ck effects get very small in the dispersive interaction regime where the effective cavity detunig is much larger than the damping rate of the cavity",
    ". however , it increases the quantum fluctuations near the bistability region and can also strengthen the atom - field entanglement in a wide range of the cavity detuning . on the other hand , we investigate the nonlinear effect of atom - atom interaction against the ck nonlinearity and show how it neutralizes the ck effects .",
    "more importantly , it is shown that in the dispersive regime where the ck effect disappears , a steady - state quadrature squeezing in the bogoliubov mode of the bec can be generated by increasing the _ s_-wave scattering frequency of the atom - atom interaction .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the hamiltonian of the system consisting of a bec inside an optical cavity , and in sec .",
    "iii the dynamics of the system is described . in sec .",
    "iv we study the ck effect on the optical bistability , and in sec.v we investigate the ck effect on the entanglement and squeezing . finally , our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "as depicted in fig.[fig : fig1 ] , the system we are going to investigate is an optical cavity with length @xmath2 consisting of a cigar - shaped bec of @xmath3 two - level atoms with mass @xmath4 and transition frequency @xmath5 confined in a cylindrically symmetric trap with a transverse trapping frequency @xmath6 and negligible longitudinal confinement along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "an external laser with frequency @xmath8 and wave number @xmath9 drives the cavity at rate @xmath10 through one of its mirrors ( @xmath11 is the laser power and @xmath12 is the cavity decay rate ) .",
    "if the laser pump is far detuned from the atomic resonance ( @xmath13 exceeds the atomic linewidth @xmath14 by orders of magnitude ) , the excited electronic state of the atoms can be adiabatically eliminated and the atomic spontaneous emission can be neglected @xcite . in this way , the dynamics of the system can be described within an effective one - dimensional model by quantizing the atomic motional degree of freedom along just the @xmath7 axis . in the frame rotating at the pump frequency",
    ", the many - body hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath15 \\psi(x)-\\hbar\\delta_{c } a^{\\dagger } a + i\\hbar\\eta(a - a^{\\dagger}),\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the annihilation operators of the atomic field and the cavity mode . in addition , @xmath18 is the cavity - pump detuning where @xmath19 is the resonance frequency of the cavity .",
    "@xmath20 is the optical lattice barrier height per photon which represents the atomic backaction on the field , @xmath21 is the vacuum rabi frequency , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the two - body _",
    "s_-wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "if the intracavity photon number is so low that the condition @xmath24 is satisfied where @xmath25 is the recoil frequency of the condensate atoms , and under the bogoliubov approximation @xcite , the atomic field operator can be expanded as the following single - mode quantum field @xmath26     and the cavity decay rate is @xmath12.,width=288 ]    where the first term is the condensate mode which is considered as a c - number and the operator @xmath27 in the second term ( the so - called bogoliubov mode ) corresponds to the quantum fluctuations of the atomic field about the classical condensate mode . by substituting the atomic field operator of eq.([opaf ] ) into eq.([h1 ] ) , we can find the hamiltonian of the system in the following form @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the stark - shifted cavity frequency due to the presence of the bec , @xmath30 is the frequency of the bogoliubov mode , @xmath31 is the optomechanical coupling between the bogoliubov and the optical modes , @xmath32 is the _",
    "s_-wave scattering frequency of the atomic collisions ( @xmath33 is the waist radius of the optical mode ) , and @xmath34 is the ck coupling .    as is seen from eq.([subh ] ) there are three kinds of nonlinearity in the hamiltonian of the system : the radiation pressure interaction between the bogoliubov mode and the optical field ( the fourth term ) , the nonlinear atom - atom interaction ( the fifth term ) , and the ck nonlinearity ( the sixth term ) .",
    "the important point is that the manifestation of the nonlinear ck term in the hamiltonian of the system is due to the direct atom - photon interaction .",
    "in other words , it is an intrinsic property of the system .",
    "a comparison between the above - mentioned three nonlinear terms show that the radiation pressure interaction is the most important term in the system because of the large value of the optomechanical coupling parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the strength of the atom - atom interaction is determined by the _ s_-wave scattering frequency @xmath36 whose value can be increased from zero up to several tens of @xmath37 by manipulating the transverse trapping frequency @xmath6 which can change the waist radius of the optical mode @xmath33 @xcite.the ck term whose strength is determined by the ck coupling parameter @xmath38 has the weakest effect among the others .",
    "in fact the ratio of the ck coupling to the optomechanical coupling is of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "so , for very large values of @xmath1 the ck term is negligible in comparison to the radiation pressure and atom - atom interactions . that is why in the previous works @xcite this term has been disregarded .",
    "the dynamics of the system described by the hamiltonian in eq.([subh ] ) is fully characterized by the following set of nonlinear heisenberg - langevin equations @xmath39 here @xmath40 characterizes the dissipation of the bogoliubov mode of the bec . the optical field quantum vacuum fluctuation @xmath41 satisfies the markovian correlation functions , i.e. , @xmath42 , @xmath43 with the average thermal photon number @xmath44 which is nearly zero at optical frequencies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath45 is the quantum noise input for the bogoliubov mode of the bec which also satisfies the same markovian correlation functions as those of the optical noise @xcite .",
    "the noise sources are assumed uncorrelated for the different modes of both the matter and light fields .    in order to linearize the nonlinear set of equations ( [ nhl ] )",
    "one can expand the quantum operators around their respective classical mean values as @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are small quantum fluctuations around the mean fields @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this way",
    ", a set of nonlinear algebraic equations for the mean - field values and another set of linear ordinary differential equations for the quantum fluctuations will be obtained .",
    "the steady - state mean - field values are obtained as follows    @xmath52    where @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the real part of the complex mean field @xmath51 , and @xmath55 .    on the other hand , by introducing the optical field and the bogoliubov mode quadratures as    [ quadratures ] @xmath56    the following linearized set of ordinary differential equations",

    "since the quadrature squeezing occurs in the dispersive regime , it is not affected by the ck nonlinearity which manifests itself jut in the nondispersive regime .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a driven optical cavity containing a cigar - shaped bec . in the weakly interacting regime , where just the first two symmetric momentum side modes are excited by the fluctuations resulting from the atom - light interaction , the bec can be considered as a single mode quantun field in the bogoliubov approximation . in this way , the bogoliubov mode of the bec is coupled to the optical field in two ways : the radiation pressure interaction and the ck coupling .",
    "although the ck coupling is much weaker than those of the radiation pressure and the atom - atom interactions , it manifests its effect when the intracavity optical field is strong enough ( when the driving rate of the cavity is increased ) .",
    "the most important outcome of the ck nonlinearity is that the bogoliubov frequency of the bec is dependent on the mean value of the optical field which leads to a change of bistability behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonlinear effect of atom - atom interaction neutralizes the ck effect when the _ s_-wave scattering frequency is increased .",
    "furthermore , the ck nonlinearity causes the quantum fluctuations of the system to be increased more rapidly near the bistability region .",
    "however , in the dispersive regime where the ck effect disappears , a steady - state quadrature squeezing in the bogoliubov mode of the bec can be generated by increasing the _ s_-wave scattering frequency of the atom - atom interaction .",

    "<S> an interacting cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) inside a driven optical cavity exhibits an intrinsic cross - kerr ( ck ) nonlinearity due to the interaction with the optical mode of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> although the ck coupling is much weaker than those of the radiation pressure and the atom - atom interactions , it can affect the bistability behavior of the system when the intensity of the laser pump is strong enough . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , there is a competition between the ck nonlinearity and the atom - atom interaction so that the latter can neutralize the effect of the former . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ck nonlinearity causes the effective frequency of the bogoliubov mode of the bec as well as the quantum fluctuations of the system to be increased by increasing the cavity driving rate . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the dispersive interaction regime the effect of the ck nonlinearity is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that by increasing the _ </S>",
    "<S> s_-wave scattering frequency of atomic collisions one can generate a strong stationary quadrature squeezing in the bogoliubov mode of the bec . </S>"
