    "the paper concerns the asympototic theory of wave propagation in networks @xmath0 of thin fibers when the thickness of fibers @xmath1 goes to zero .",
    "an approximation of a wave or heat proceses in such a network by a one - dimensional problem on the limiting metric ( quantum ) graph has been discussed in physical literature for at least three decades . in recent years",
    "it was the subject of several mathematical conferences .",
    "the central point of the asymptotic theory is the structure of the physical field near junctions ( branching points of the network ) . in the majority of publications on quantum graphs the gluing conditions on the vertices of the graph ( they correspond to the junctions )",
    "have the simplest kirchhoff s form .",
    "this form can be justified in some cases ( say , for the heat transport in a network with insulated walls , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we discussed some possible applications of the quantum graph approximations to the study of periodic optical systems : structure of the spectrum , scattering , slowing down of the light , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we assumed there that the kirchoff s gc at vertices were imposed .",
    "however , our recent study leads us to the conclusion that the kirchoff s gc are an exception in optical applications where the spectral parameter @xmath2 is greater than the threshold @xmath3 the latter is equivalent to the condition that the propagation of waves in the waveguides ( cylindrical parts of the network ) is possible .",
    "if @xmath4 is unbounded , this also means that @xmath2 belongs to the absolutely continuous spectrum of the problem . while many particular cases of that problem with @xmath5 or @xmath6 were considered ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , the publications @xcite-@xcite were the first ones dealing with the case @xmath7 and the first ones where the significance of the scattering solutions for asymptotic analysis was established .",
    "papers @xcite-@xcite contain asymptotic analysis of the spectrum , resolvent and solutions of the problem in a network @xmath0 when @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown there that the gc in those cases have general symplectic structure and can be expressed in terms of the scattering matrices defined by individual junctions .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to describe the wave propagation through networks of thin fibers of necklace type resulting in general gc at the vertices of the limiting graph .",
    "we say that a network is of necklace type if it is periodic in one direction and is bounded in the orthogonal plane .",
    "the transition from the networks of thin fibers to the one - dimensional problem on the graph will be recalled in the next section ( see details in @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the necklace type graphs will be considered in section 3 .",
    "we will calculate the propagator through one period , find the dispersion relation , describe the band - gap structure of the spectrum and find reflection and transmission coefficients for the truncated graph .",
    "the main feature which distinguishes the graph theory from the bloch theory of 1d periodic schrodinger ( hill ) operators is that the propagator through one period is not an analytic function of the frequency anymore , but a meromorphic one .",
    "the corresponding poles ( resonances ) play an important role in applications . in the last section",
    ", we consider a specific necklace device and show how the earlier results allow one to find parameters which provide slowing down of the wave packets ( slowing down of the light ) accompanied by the transparency ( almost zero reflection ) .",
    "consider the stationary wave ( helmholtz ) equation @xmath9 in a domain @xmath10 @xmath11 with infinitely smooth boundary ( for simplicity ) , which has the following structure : @xmath0 is a union of a finite number of cylinders @xmath12 ( which will be called channels ) of lengths @xmath13 @xmath14 with diameters of cross - sections of order @xmath15 and domains ( which will be called junctions ) connecting the channels into a network .",
    "it is assumed that the junctions have diameters of the same order @xmath16 .",
    "the boundary condition has the form : @xmath17 ( the dirichlet bc ) or @xmath18 ( the neumann bc ) or @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the exterior normal and  the function @xmath21 is real valued and does not depend on the longitudinal ( parallel to the axis ) coordinate on the boundary of the channels .",
    "one also can impose one type of bc on the lateral boundary of @xmath0 and another bc on the free ends ( which are not adjacent to a junction ) of the channels .     with four junctions , four unbounded channels and four bounded channels .",
    "]    the domain @xmath0 shrinks to a one - dimensional metric graph @xmath22 as @xmath8 .",
    "the axes of the channels form edges @xmath23 @xmath14 of @xmath24 , and the distances between points of @xmath25 are defined by the distances between the corresponding points of the channels .",
    "the junctions shrink to vertices of the graph @xmath24 .",
    "we denote the set of vertices @xmath26 by @xmath27 .    , network of a necklace type which will be studied in more detail later . ]    for the sake of simplicity , we impose the following two geometrical conditions .",
    "first , we assume that all the channels @xmath12 have the same cross - section @xmath28 ( the general case is studied in @xcite ) .",
    "the second condition concerns the junctions .",
    "we assume that they are self - similar .",
    "the latter means that there exist an @xmath29- independent domain @xmath30 and a point @xmath31 such that @xmath32    from the self - similarity assumption it follows that @xmath33is an @xmath1-homothety of a bounded domain @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the eigenvalues of the negative laplacian @xmath36 in @xmath37 with orthonormal eigenfunctions @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the boundary operator on the channels defined in ( [ h0 ] ) . then @xmath41 are eigenvalues of @xmath36 in @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the corresponding orthonormal eigenfunctions , @xmath44 we will call the point @xmath45 the threshold , since it is the bottom of the absolutely continuous spectrum of operator ( [ h0 ] ) if @xmath46 has an infinite channel .",
    "we introduce euclidean coordinates @xmath47 in channels @xmath12 chosen in such a way that the @xmath48-axis is parallel to the axis of the        channel , hyperplane @xmath49 is orthogonal to the axis , and @xmath12 has the following form in the new coordinates : @xmath50 if a channel @xmath12 is bounded ( @xmath51 ) , the direction of the @xmath48 axis can be chosen arbitrarily ( at least for now ) .",
    "if a channel is unbounded , then @xmath52 corresponds to its cross - section which is adjacent to the junction .",
    "we will impose the condition @xmath53 ( see @xcite for the general case ) .",
    "note that waves governed by ( [ h0 ] ) do not propagate through the channels if @xmath54 .",
    "there exists only one propagating mode @xmath55 if @xmath53 , and there are many similar modes @xmath56 if @xmath57 .    while many particular cases of problem ( [ h0 ] ) with @xmath58 or @xmath59 were considered ( see references in @xcite ) , the publications @xcite-@xcite were the first ones dealing with the case @xmath60 and the first ones where the significance of the scattering solutions for asymptotic analysis of @xmath61 was established .",
    "in particular , it was shown there that in both cases @xmath62 and @xmath63 the scattering solutions for equation ( [ h0 ] ) and the resolvent of the operator @xmath61 can be approximated by the corresponding solutions of the one - dimensional problem on the limiting graph @xmath24 with the gc expressed in terms of the scattering matrices of the individual extended junctions .",

    "usually some type of a periodic structure is suggested for these devices with a band - gap structure of the spectrum . if a narrow band is created , then the dispersion relation for the corresponding frequency is flat and the group velocity @xmath240 is small .",
    "the main feature which distinguishes a necklace waveguide from other one - dimensional ( or quasi one - dimensional ) periodic problem is the following . while the hill discriminant for a standard periodic schrodinger operator is an analytic function of frequency , it is meromorphic for the necklace waveguides .",
    "we will show that one can easily find parameters when the hill discriminant has two close poles ( as close as one pleases ) with a zero in between .",
    "thus the band will be as narrow as we please around a chosen value @xmath241 of the frequency .",
    "therefore , the group velocity will be small if the support of the wave packets belongs to a small neighborhood of @xmath242 .",
    "the second feature concerns the truncated necklace graph ( waveguide ) @xmath243 which consists of @xmath244 cells of periodicity confined between points @xmath215 and @xmath245 and the rays @xmath246 when propagation of a narrow in frequency wave packet through a finite device is considered , it could happen that the waves , which are slowing down in the device , can not enter the device . in other words , one needs to know that the reflection coefficient @xmath247 for the truncated necklace waveguide is not too big ( better if it is small ) for the frequencies where the slowing down occurs . it will be shown that for a given frequency @xmath241 one can choose the parameters @xmath248 such that @xmath249 at @xmath241 , and therefore they are small for @xmath250 close enough to @xmath242 .    _",

    "we find that @xmath308    finally , we fix small @xmath309 and choose @xmath310 then we solve ( [ rnrn ] ) for @xmath311 in a neighborhood of the point @xmath312 .",
    "this implies @xmath313 where the exact value of @xmath314 can be easily found from ( [ rnrn ] ) .",
    "we put @xmath241 in ( [ ttt ] ) and determine @xmath305 from ( [ xx ] ) , ( [ yy ] ) .",
    "this choice of @xmath305 implies ( [ mo ] ) .    by solving ( [ f ] )",
    "asymptotically , we find that its solution also has the form ( [ xx ] ) , ( [ yy ] ) with a different value of @xmath314 .",
    "this justifies the existence of a pole of the hill discriminant at the distance o@xmath315 from the point @xmath316 in fact , let us omit the cubic term in ( [ yy ] )",
    ". then equations ( [ xx ] ) , ( [ yy ] ) with two different values of @xmath314 define two parabolas @xmath317 and @xmath318 with the same vertex and tangent line at the vertex . if we put @xmath241 in ( [ ttt ] ) and fix @xmath309 , we get a point on @xmath317 at the distance of order @xmath309 from the vertex which defines @xmath319 .",
    "this choice implies ( [ mo ] ) .",
    "when @xmath250 changes : @xmath320 , point @xmath281 moves in the direction of the vector @xmath321 or in the opposite direction ( see [ ttt ] ) .",
    "we may change the sign of @xmath322 , if needed , to guarantee that the point moves toward the second parabola where @xmath272 .",
    "the only unacceptable situation is when the vector @xmath321 is tangent to @xmath317 .",
    "it will not happen in a generic case .",
    "besides one can always avoid it by changing @xmath323 or @xmath324 , since they are defined up to an integer multiple of @xmath325 .",
    "the arguments above prove that wave packet with frequencies in o@xmath315-semi - neighborhood of @xmath242 will propagate with the group velocity @xmath326o@xmath315 and the reflection coefficient will have order o@xmath315 .",
    "we conclude this subsection by the following remark .",
    "let the geometry of the junctions be chosen .",
    "after that , we must choose specific @xmath319 satisfying ( [ xx ] ) , ( [ yy ] ) .",
    "it is easy to choose one of these parameters ( for example , @xmath323 ) by changing the distance between two neighboring junctions , but @xmath324 will be defined after that by the geometry of the network .",
    "in fact it is not the geometrical , but only the optical length which plays role here .",
    "one can preserve the geometry of the network and change the refraction index in some of the channels to satisfy the relations ( [ xx ] ) , ( [ yy ] ) .",
    "this produces the same effect as changing the lengths of the corresponding channels .",
