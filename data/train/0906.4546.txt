    "supersymmetric particles have been so far elusive . nor we have seen any indirect signal of them in flavour physics , giving rise to the so - called _ supersymmetric flavour problem_. assuming that s - particles at the fermi scale indeed exist , is there any message in this ?",
    "on one side , the discovery potential of the lhc in its full strength appears large enough to render this question not so urgent : if s - particles are there , they will be seen . on the other side ,",
    "any orientation towards a specifically motivated configuration of s - particle masses and , possibly , of corresponding signals would clearly be valuable .",
    "this would be especially true in the case of particular configurations that appear to have received relatively little attention in the otherwise vast literature on phenomenological supersymmetry .",
    "we argue in the following that there is one such case , based on naturalness and on the supersymmetric flavour problem .",
    "as we shall see , it is also simple to characterize some of its features , useful to define a strategy for its discovery .",
    "since naturalness is the main motivation for supersymmetry at the fermi scale , it makes sense to ask which are the parameters affecting the s - particle spectrum that are mostly constrained by naturalness itself .",
    "we have in mind a generic minimal supersymmetric standard model , unconstrained by specific supersymmetry breaking mechanisms or specific unification conditions .",
    "the answer is well known :    * the @xmath2-parameter , which affects the electroweak scale already at tree level and gives , in absence of mixing with the gauginos , the higgsino masses ; * the masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the third generation of squarks , which are coupled through the large top yukawa coupling , @xmath5 , to the higgs system and define , together with the stop - mixing term , the physical masses , @xmath6 , of the two _ stops _ , @xmath7 , and of the left - handed _ sbottom _",
    ", @xmath8 , in absence of mixing with the right - handed one .",
    "these can be the lightest s - particle masses , whereas all the other s - partner masses , allowed to go to their naturalness limits , can be heavier or be phenomenologically ( almost ) irrelevant for lhc .",
    "we find this possibility - to be made more precise in a while - motivated by two main considerations . if these are the s - particle masses , the supersymmetric flavour problem gets definitely alleviated , if not solved completely , depending on the assumptions one is willing to make on the ( approximate ) flavour symmetries .",
    "we have in mind , at least as an example , an approximate @xmath9 symmetry which enforces ckm - like angles in the extra supersymmetric interactions and some amount of degeneracy between the s - fermions of the first two generations@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is also true - without any bias from specific models - that both the @xmath2-parameter and the masses of the squarks coupled to the higgs system via @xmath5 are sufficiently singled out from the other mass parameters that one may conceive for them a somewhat special role .",
    "here it suffices to mention the much discussed @xmath2-problem and , e.g. , the effect of @xmath5 on the running of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "let us be more specific on our choice of the mass parameters . a relevant range for the @xmath2-parameter is between 100 and 200 gev , to evade the lep2 bound on charginos but otherwise not significantly above the fermi scale itself , @xmath10 gev .",
    "the masses of @xmath7 and @xmath11 should just be sufficiently heavy to allow a higgs boson mass again consistent with the lep2 bounds : depending on the mixing term between the stops , their typical range is in the hundreds of gevs ( see below ) .",
    "the gluino mass , @xmath12 , is also constrained by naturalness and flavour considerations . on the upper side ,",
    "@xmath13 drives a one loop effect on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that wants to make them too heavy , depending on the messenger scale . on the low side , gluino - sbottom exchanges in @xmath14 @xcite@xcite and @xmath15 @xcite@xcite amplitudes with",
    "ckm - like angles point to a not too light gluino .",
    "an interesting range for the gluino mass is between 500 gev and 1 tev .",
    "naturalness allows the remaining s - particles to be heavy enough to play little role in the lhc phenomenology , at least in a first stage .",
    "this is the case for all the s - fermions with small coupling to the higgs system , that can go in the @xmath16 tev range and @xmath17 but all the third generation s - fermions be relatively lighter than those ones of the first two generations .",
    "this could still be consistent with current flavor constraints , although bringing the focus also on the @xmath18 transition , mediated by stau - gaugino exchanges , and on the ongoing experiment at psi@xcite . from the point of view of the lhc signals discussed below nothing would change as long as the right sbottom mass is comparable or heavier than @xmath13 and both @xmath19 s and the third generation s - neutrino(s ) are heavier than @xmath2 . in turn the heaviness of @xmath20",
    "relative to @xmath17 could be due to the smallness of the bottom yukawa coupling relative to the top one in their running effects on the squark masses.]@xcite , and for the electroweak gauginos , that can safely be taken at about 500 gev or even higher .",
    "as we are going to see , an advantage of considering this configuration of s - particle masses is that its main lhc phenomenology is fully determined by a few physical parameters , irrespective of the underlying theoretical model .",
    "fig . [ spettro ] shows a particular representation of the generic s - particle spectrum that we are led to consider below 1 tev .",
    "the lightest s - fermions are mostly higgsino - like , have an average mass @xmath2 , a small splitting among them , in the 10 gev range , and a definite order , @xmath21 .",
    "the decay among them of the heavier into the lighter ones via virtual @xmath22 and @xmath23 produces also leptons , whose possible detection has been analyzed in ref .",
    "the softness of these leptons , however , make us consider other signals of this configuration of s - particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the splitting among the light higgsinos can be safely neglected .",
    "furthermore , as anticipated , the heavier ( mostly ) electroweak gauginos play no relevant role .",
    "although they can occur in two body decays of some squarks , the corresponding branching ratios are negligibly small , at the relative _ per cent _ level , because of the stronger coupling of the squarks to the higgsinos and because of phase space .",
    "the most significant signals in the relatively earlier stages of the lhc come from gluino pair production , followed , when allowed by phase space , by two - body gluino decays : @xmath24 and the corresponding conjugate modes , each with equal branching ratios .",
    "all these branching ratios , given in appendix a , are determined by @xmath25 and by the stop mixing angle @xmath26 , defined in terms of the left and right stops by @xmath27 the mass of the single relevant sbottom is . ]",
    "@xmath28 by definition @xmath29 .    in a synthetic notation ,",
    "all the two - body decays of the three squarks , when allowed by phase space and charge conservation , are @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 other than @xmath6 and @xmath34 , the branching ratios for these decays involve @xmath2 and @xmath35 , as is the case for the mass of the lightest scalar , @xmath36 .",
    "all of these quantities are given in appendix a. a relevant range for @xmath37 is between 5 and 10 . at @xmath38",
    "the lep bound on @xmath39 is problematic . on the contrary",
    ", the higgsino - stop contribution to @xmath40 grows like @xmath37 and , with mixing angles analogous to the ckm ones , becomes exceedingly large . as an example , this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bsgamma ] , which is well representative of the generic situation . while this is uncertain , also in view of possible cancellations with other contributions to the @xmath40 amplitude coming from charged higgs or gluino exchanges , we find it better to stick to @xmath41 .",
    "in fact the specific value taken by @xmath37 between 5 and 10 constrains @xmath6 and @xmath34 through @xmath42 gev but is otherwise practically irrelevant in the branching ratios for the modes ( [ sqchi ] , [ sqv ] , [ sqs ] )",
    ". incidentally notice also from fig.[bsgamma ] that @xmath40 disfavours highly asymmetric stop masses because of the correspondingly growing stop - mixing parameter for fixed values of @xmath34 . in the same @xmath43-plane , on the contrary",
    ", there is no significant constraint from the @xmath44-parameter .",
    "[ bsgamma ]   from its measured value @xmath45 , in the illustrative case that the susy amplitude is _ only _ given by the higgsino - stop exchange with _ exactly _ ckm mixing angles .",
    "the lep bound on the higgs boson mass ( see eq .",
    "( [ higgsmass ] ) in the appendix ) is satisfied above the red dashed line.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    from its measured value @xmath45 , in the illustrative case that the susy amplitude is _ only _ given by the higgsino - stop exchange with _ exactly _ ckm mixing angles .",
    "the lep bound on the higgs boson mass ( see eq .",
    "( [ higgsmass ] ) in the appendix ) is satisfied above the red dashed line.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    largely dominant among the squark decays are the higgsino decays ( [ sqchi ] ) .",
    "this is a cumulative effect of phase space and of suppression factors of the decay amplitudes into the vector bosons and into scalars .",
    "furthermore , among the same higgsino decays , one of them , @xmath46 also has a suppressed amplitude , relative to the other ones , by a factor @xmath47 .",
    "this is because the coupling between @xmath48 and @xmath49 only occurs in the down yukawa coupling . a good approximation for a general discussion , therefore , is provided by sticking to the following relevant decay modes : @xmath50 and the corresponding conjugate ones .",
    "as already mentioned , the decays @xmath51 are meant to be summed over the two neutral almost degenerate higgsinos . in turn , the possible final states in the gluino chain decay are limited to : @xmath52 with the last two conjugate decays having an identical branching ratio , @xmath53 we find it a remarkable simplification that a single inclusive branching ratio may end up characterizing the main features of the phenomenology of this configuration of s - particle masses , as we are going to discuss .",
    "this remains true even if one wants to include in the gluino decay chain the subdominant modes @xmath54 , @xmath55 . to this end",
    "one needs to generalize @xmath56 to @xmath57 where @xmath58 or @xmath59 or @xmath60 . in any given point of the parameter space",
    "the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath61 is small .",
    "furthermore @xmath61 is equally useful to characterize the features of the events we study in the next section .",
    "as it is clear from the previous considerations , the most characteristic feature of the lhc signals from this configuration of s - particle masses is an overproduction of top quarks from gluino decays .",
    "starting from gluino pair production , there will in fact be four types of semi - inclusive final states : @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where , as before , @xmath66 stands for a charged or any one of the two neutral higgsinos .",
    "their rates will depend in good approximation , up to the overall gluino - pair production rate , only on @xmath56 , @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath56 is therefore the crucial quantity to study .",
    "whenever @xmath71 is negligible in phase space factors , it is @xmath72 .",
    "this follows from the form of the top yukawa coupling , which , as already mentioned , dominates over the bottom one and dictates the couplings of the left and right squarks to the higgsinos @xmath73 where both the charged @xmath74 and the neutral @xmath66 , in the limit of degenerate @xmath75 , can be considered as dirac spinors of the same mass @xmath2 .",
    "neglect first @xmath76 mixing . then from ( [ yukawa - stops ] ) and @xmath77 ( up to @xmath71 corrections ) @xmath78 and @xmath79 with the same branching ratios for the charge conjugate modes .",
    "hence indeed @xmath80 , either from ( [ gluino_tl ] ) or from ( [ gluino_tr ] ) , which does not change by @xmath76 mixing since @xmath56 is inclusive . on the other hand ,",
    "whenever @xmath71 becomes important in phase space factors , @xmath56 increases since the @xmath81-reach modes are favoured over the @xmath82-reach ones .",

    "yet it is useful to concentrate one s attention on it - we believe - as a particularly interesting case , for the reasons also given in sect . 1 .",
    "the most characteristic signal to be expected at the lhc is due to the relative abundance of multi - top events .",
    "there may be several ways to attack the detection of this signal .",
    "most significantly , however , the top decays will produce a number of hard @xmath98 same - sign di - leptons or tri - lepton events with rates , for any given gluino mass , that can be easily read from fig.s [ btb ] and [ rates ] in any point of the parameter space . what counts most is the inclusive branching ratio @xmath56 defined in eq .",

    ". we would not be too surprised if this turned out to be the first signal of manifest supersymmetry .",
    "how generic are these considerations from the point of view of the lhc signals ?",
    "while they are certainly not completely generic , they can apply with little or even no modifications at all also to some other configurations of s - particle masses , more or less theoretically motivated but certainly possible .",
    "the important thing is that no squarks other than @xmath7 and @xmath11 are introduced below 1 tev .",
    "sleptons , on the contrary , can be anywhere above @xmath2 . these modifications alone would introduce essentially no change of the picture described above .",
    "some change would on the contrary occur by bringing down the electroweak gaugino masses relative to fig .",
    "[ spettro ] .",
    "this would make the full chargino - neutralino sector enter into the gluino decay chain , with the net result , however , of increasing the number of high @xmath98 multi - lepton events .",
    "other than those ones coming from the semi - leptonic top decays , one would also have the leptons from the cascade decays inside the chargino - neutralino sector .",

    "[ spettro ] would in fact be insufficient to make the observed amount of dark matter .",
    "finally one can ask what happens on the low side of the gluino mass range that we have considered , or even below it , for the same configuration of the other s - particles .",
    "the answer is clear .",
