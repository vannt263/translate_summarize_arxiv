    "<S> introduction. _ the sensitive measurement of signals , such as force , pressure , electric field , temperature , with high spatial resolution possesses a wide range of applications in physics , engineering and the life sciences . </S>",
    "<S> conventional methods , e.g. for pressure detection can usually operate at length scales down to the micron scale . going beyond this regime whilst retaining highest sensitivity </S>",
    "<S> represents a significant challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond @xcite has been established as a highly sensitive room - temperature nanoscale probe for magnetic @xcite and electric fields @xcite as well as temperature @xcite building on the strength of the excellent coherence properties of an nv - center electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> the operational principle of such kind of diamond quantum sensor is based on the fact that a magnetic / electric field or temperature change will directly affect the spin properties of the nv center which can then be detected by optical means . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of pressure acting on a diamond lattice for example leads to the coupling between the orbital and spin dynamics of the nv center . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a method to measure very high pressure with a sensitivity better than existing techniques @xcite . at room temperature , </S>",
    "<S> however , the coupling between the strain of diamond lattice and the ground state manifold of the nv - center spin is not sufficient for measuring a low pressure or force .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a hybrid device that combines a nv - center quantum sensor in diamond with a surface layer of piezomagnetic material as a signal transducer . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of ultrapure isotopically modified diamond and subsequent nitrogen implantation make it possible to engineer nv centers close to the diamond surface @xcite and therefore in close proximity to the piezomagnetic material layer . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for the detection of changes in the stray magnetic field @xcite generated by the piezomagnetic material due to an external stress . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effect of pressure on the nv - center spin can be enhanced by three orders of magnitude when compared to the effect of the direct application of stress on the diamond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the nv center lies close to the magnetic material , the magnetic noise is also expected to become more significant and deteriorate the measurement sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the sensitivity of such a hybrid diamond - piezomagnetic device for the measurement of stress ( force ) with detailed numerical studies , and show that a sensitivity of sub - kpa/@xmath0 ( tens of fn/@xmath0 ) can be achieved for the measurement of pressure ( force ) under ambient conditions with state - of - the - art experimental capabilities by choosing appropriate control parameters .    in combination with piezoelectric and thermally sensitive elements </S>",
    "<S> , our proposed hybrid piezomagentic - nv approach also provides a new method for the measurement of electric field and temperature with a sensitivity improved by orders of magnitude as compared to standard diamond nv sensor . </S>",
    "<S> the high spatial resolution is achieved thanks to the atomic size of the nv center and the ability for positioning it with high accuracy @xcite in nanoscale diamond . besides its application in signal transduction and precision measurement , </S>",
    "<S> the proposed hybrid system can be exploited to couple the nv - center spin to mechanical oscillations , and significantly enhance the coherent coupling between these two degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this would allow fast mechanical control of spin qubits , large phonon induced spin - spin interaction , and efficient phonon cooling by an nv center @xcite .         _ </S>",
    "<S> the model. _ we consider a system ( see fig.[fig : setup](a ) ) made up of a diamond layer grown on the surface of a thin piezomagnetic film such as @xmath1 ( terfenol - d ) which exhibits a high magnetostrictive effect . </S>",
    "<S> the surface area of the piezomagnetic film can be reduced to a designed size by subsequent selective etching . </S>",
    "<S> the nv center is implanted in the diamond layer with a depth denoted as @xmath2 from the interface between the magnetic film and diamond . </S>",
    "<S> the ground @xmath3 level of the nv - center spin exhibits a zero field splitting of @xmath4 between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 spin sub - levels . </S>",
    "<S> the spin hamiltonian , including the strain effect of the diamond lattice and the zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field , is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the magnetic field component in parallel and perpendicular to the nv axis arising from both the applied external magnetic field and the stray magnetic field generated by the piezomagnetic film . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of strain on the nv center , as quantified by @xmath11 , induces ground state spin sub - level mixing and is usually much smaller ( on the order of @xmath12 ) than the energy splitting along the nv axis . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - field splitting @xmath13 is slightly affected by the stress due to pressure @xmath14 , with a gradient of about @xmath15 at room temperature @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we will be mostly interested in the case of a weak ( sub @xmath16 ) pressure , and therefore such a direct effect of stress in the diamond lattice on the nv spin is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling strength between an electric field and the nv ground state spin is also negligible in the present model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - dependent fluorescence of an nv center , see fig.[fig : setup](b ) , provides an efficient mechanism to optically initialize and readout the ground state spin , and to perform optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) measurements in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance frequencies @xmath17 in the odmr spectra correspond to the electronic transitions from the spin sub - level @xmath5 to @xmath6 respectively , which depend on the magnetic field acting on the nv center .    </S>",

    "<S> the response of the piezomagnetic materials that have large magnetostriction , such as terfenol - d , lead to a change of the magnetization directions of domains , and in turn of the stray magnetic field @xcite that affects the spin properties of nv centers .         </S>",

    "<S> the enhancement would be more significant for shallower nv , e.g. we find @xmath35 for @xmath36 nm . we remark that the stress - induced frequency shift of the nv center can be further improved by optimizing the dimension of the piezomagnetic film and the depth of the nv center . </S>",

    "<S> the sensitivity for the measurement of temperature can reach @xmath92 , and does not require an interrogation time of millisecond @xcite .    _ discussion and outlook. _ the proposed diamond - piezomagnetic hybrid sensor combines high sensitivity under ambient conditions with nanometer scale dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> such a device can find a wide range of applications for measuring weak forces and pressures , tiny electric field and temperature changes in many areas at ambient conditions , such as protein folding and dna stretching in life science @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has implications for the study of fundamental quantum physics phenomena such as the casimir effect @xcite or non - newtonian forces where forces have to be measured at smallest distances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it may also find applications in spin and mechanical oscillator hybrid systems . </S>",
    "<S> a hybrid diamond - piezomagnetic ( film ) mechanical nanoresonator can significantly enhance the coupling between its vibrational mode and nv electronic spins in diamond @xcite , and thereby boost the phonon - mediated effective spin - spin interactions . </S>",
