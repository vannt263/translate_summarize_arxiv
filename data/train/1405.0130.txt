    "we now have a clear and consistent picture of the observed linewidths ( damping rates ) associated with @xmath3 and @xmath0 modes @xcite .",
    "the most notable feature of the observed damping rates is the ` plateau ' between @xmath6 and @xmath7 mhz followed by a gradual rise .",
    "damping rates indicate a global observational signature of the energy loss experienced by the @xmath0 modes while a local signature of this energy loss is characterised by absorption coefficient which is a measure of the difference between the incoming and outgoing @xmath0-mode power around a magnetic region .",

    "they found that tube mode excitation on fibril magnetic fields may be a dominant source of low - frequency @xmath0-mode damping rates .",
    "further work on this mechanism of @xmath0-mode damping by @xcite found that the damping rates are very sensitive to the upper boundary condition .",
    "they also demonstrated that @xmath0 modes efficiently generate tube waves and that an energy flux in excess of @xmath11 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath13 can be driven upward through photospheric levels .",

    "in this section we describe the equilibrium model of a slender magnetic fibril as an axisymmetric magnetic flux tube embedded in a plane - parallel , gravitationally stratified two - region atmosphere .",
    "the lower and upper layers of the model represent the subsurface and the upper atmosphere respectively .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to consider polytropic and isothermal atmospheres for the interior and the upper photosphere respectively .",
    "a schematic representation of the excitation of tube waves along a thin magnetic fibril due to @xmath0-mode buffeting in our two - region model is shown in figure [ fig : atmos ] .",

    "the pressure and density decrease exponentially with height at the same rate , thus the sound speed ( and the temperature ) is constant . +   + the characteristic physical scales for our model photosphere ( @xmath5 )",

    "we assume the magnetic fibril is a thin , untwisted , axisymmetric and vertically aligned magnetic flux tube which lacks internal lateral structure .",
    "for such a thin magnetic flux tube to be in thermal equilibrium and hydrostatic balance requires that temperature and the total pressure is uniform across the tube and is equal to the external pressure and temperature .",
    "thus the magnetic pressure has the same scale height as the gas pressure which results in a constant plasma-@xmath35 ( ratio of gas to magnetic pressure ) with height within the tube .",
    "since the gas pressure decreases rapidly with height in the solar atmosphere so does the magnetic pressure ; this then results in significant flaring of field lines which inevitably will break the thin flux tube approximation .",
    "however , if the skin depth of the wave solutions are sufficiently small , the waves will not sense the uppermost portion of the atmosphere where the approximation becomes invalid . therefore , we can safely ignore this problem if we restrict our attention to frequencies below the cut - off frequency for the isothermal atmosphere .",
    "the lateral variation of the magnetic field is ignored ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see for details ) .",
    "thus the tube s internal pressure @xmath36 , density @xmath37 , magnetic field @xmath38 , and cross - sectional area @xmath39 can be described as follows , @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the constant magnetic flux",

    "for the polytrope , the temperature varies linearly with depth ( @xmath48 ) thus the vertical eigenfunction is represented by the whittaker function @xmath49 ( see equation ( [ wave : sol : poly ] ) ) . whereas , for the isothermal region the temperature is constant and so we also fourier analyse the governing equation ( equation ( [ iso : gov ] ) ) in height .",

    "the upper and lower boundary conditions we require are that the wave energy density is finite as @xmath55 . the details are given in appendix [ ge : sausage ] .",
    "the aim is to understand how mhd tube waves can transport energy from @xmath0 modes in the convection zone down into the deep interior and up into the upper photosphere / lower chromosphere . in appendix [ ef : sausage ]",

    "the @xmath35 dependence of both the damping and of absorption vary non - linearly , with a peak at around @xmath80 and decreasing in magnitude with increasing and decreasing @xmath35 from this peak .",
    "the upward and downward wave energy flux are calculated as @xmath19 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "no wave energy escapes the upper domain into the overlying atmosphere since the sausage waves are evanescent in the frequency regime we are restricted to ( see figure [ fig : disp ] below dot - dashed line ) .",
    "therefore all wave energy which escapes the acoustic cavity in the model is through the lower domain .",
    "this property is similar to that of a model with a stress - free condition imposed at the photosphere , except that additional driving can occur above the photosphere and the phase shift of the reflected wave may differ .",
    "+   + the low frequency portion of the damping rates and absorption coefficients are in very good agreement to previous studies where a stress - free boundary condition was applied at the model photosphere ( @xmath5 ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this frequency regime the upper turning point of both sausage waves and @xmath0 modes",
    "are well below the interface , thus , the isothermal region behaves very similar to a stress - free boundary at @xmath5 ( see figure [ fig : dampcz0392 ] ) .",
    "this also implies that for low frequencies most of the @xmath0-mode energy lost to the tube escapes down the tube and very little escapes into the isothermal atmosphere , which is apparent when the energy fluxes @xmath82 and @xmath83 are investigated in detail ( see  [ ef : sausage ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : eued ] we plot the upward sausage wave energy flux , @xmath82 , ( equation ( [ ef : u : iso ] ) ) as a function of height and the corresponding value of @xmath83 as a reference for how large the upward energy flux is .",
    "the solid curve in figure [ fig : eued ] shows that the upward wave energy flux decays with height , but , the rate of decay decreases with frequency . for frequencies above @xmath8 mhz a significant amount of energy flux remains in the tube , even a few scale heights above the interface , this energy flux eventually decays to zero and does not leave the domain i.e. , does not contribute to the damping and absorption of @xmath0 modes .",
    "the sausage waves are evanescent in the isothermal region thus their wave energy flux is not being carried by free oscillations .",
    "the flux is the result of driven oscillations from below and the flux decreases with height because the @xmath0-mode driver ( also evanescent ) acts as a sink in the isothermal region removing energy form the tube . although caution must be taken for frequencies too close to the cut - off frequency , since very close to this frequency the @xmath0-mode eigenfunction and , hence the wave driver , has a skin depth that is insufficiently short to ensure that the excitation remains finite with height",
    "this manifests as divergent behaviour in @xmath82 in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "explicitly , the term @xmath85 in equation ( [ ef : u : iso ] ) diverges with height because of its dependence on @xmath86)$ ] .",
    "this divergent behaviour is clearly unphysical and can be avoided if we ensure that @xmath87 , or for the parameters used here , if we restrict our attention to frequencies below @xmath88 mhz .",
    "+     + the inclusion of an upper isothermal atmosphere allows us to take into account the coupling of all waves between the two regions which is an arduous procedure but required in order to model the reflective properties of the upper atmosphere with even minimal fidelity . in figure",
    "[ fig : dampcz0392 ] we compare damping rates for our two - region ( infinite domain ) model with truncated polytrope models with stress - free and maximal - flux boundary conditions applied at the interface ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "as noted earlier the low frequency behaviour of the two - region model is similar to that of the stress - free case ; the isothermal atmosphere reflects all waves back down the tube in a similar manner as in the stress - free case . for higher frequencies",
    "the damping of @xmath0 modes decrease compared to the stress - free case , this is due to the mechanism discussed earlier , that the @xmath0 modes act as a sink in the isothermal atmosphere extracting energy out of sausage waves . in the stress - free model the upward propagating wave is forced to reflect at the interface and thus propagates down the tube and this energy loss is measured at the lower boundary as a combination of downward and upward reflected propagating waves . in the present two - region case , this upward propagating wave in the polytrope is no longer reflecting in the same manner at the interface and instead becomes evanescent very close to the interface and a portion of its wave energy is transported into the isothermal region .",
    "this energy flux then decreases to zero with height and thus we measure a zero contribution to the escaping wave energy flux , reducing the damping rate at higher frequencies where this effect becomes more and more dominant .",
    "the maximal - flux condition ( introduced in @xcite ) is vital in providing an upper limit on the amount of energy lost from @xmath3 and @xmath0 modes to magnetic tube waves .",
    "however it does not provide insight into the nature of the interaction of tube waves with a realistic overlying atmosphere ( figure [ fig : dampcz0392 ] dashed lines ) .      in this paper",
    "we have presented a calculation for damping rates and absorption coefficients of solar @xmath0 modes due to the excitation of sausage tube waves in a two - region ( isothermal - polytropic ) atmosphere . by including an isothermal region above the @xmath0-mode cavity we have shown that the linewidths ( or damping rates ) of solar @xmath3 and @xmath0 modes are sensitive to a change in the reflective properties of the surface . +   + our two - region atmosphere model demonstrates the importance of coupling between the interior to the upper atmosphere for the near surface behaviour of the solar acoustic oscillations and the magnetic sausage tube waves .",
    "the comparison of damping rates and absorption coefficients with previous such studies demonstrates that a stress - free boundary condition applied at the photosphere gives a good approximation , at low frequencies , but should be considered with caution as one approaches closer to the acoustic cut - off frequency .",
    "+   + for the absorption coefficients , it has also been previously noted that at low frequencies below @xmath8 mhz the theoretical estimates are qualitatively similar to the observations @xcite which is consistent with the results presented here . above @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 mhz the observations underestimate the absorption of @xmath0-mode energy and show a rapid fall - off of the absorption coefficient which is likely to be due to the existence of high - frequency halos surrounding active regions @xcite and due to acoustic jacket modes in the @xmath3- and @xmath0-mode wavefields @xcite .",
