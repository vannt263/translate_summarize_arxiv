    "mass loss due to stellar winds is one of the governing factors that determine the evolution of massive stars .",
    "great improvements in our understanding of line - driven winds from massive hot stars ( i.e. , o - type stars or wolf - rayet stars ) have been achieved over the last three decades , and they are well reflected in recent stellar evolution models ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "however , the driving mechanism for cool - star winds remains elusive .",
    "note that many of the authors still rely on the empirical mass - loss rate given by @xcite ( hereafter , jnh88 ) , which is more than 20 years old , for modeling cool giant stars , while some alternative prescriptions have been considered by some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "late stages of massive star evolution during and after core helium burning are therefore relatively difficult to study , which is a major obstacle to theoretical investigation on supernova progenitors and their environments .",
    "one of the key factors that should be taken into account for the study of the red supergiant ( rsg ) evolution is pulsation .",
    "it is well known that rsgs are unstable to radial pulsations driven by partial ionization of hydrogen in the outermost layers of the envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and pulsation is one of the most commonly invoked mechanisms for driving winds from cool stars ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the detailed mechanisms for driving mass loss by pulsations are not well understood , simple arguments based on the gain of pulsation energy suggest that rsgs might experience a stronger mass loss for a higher growth rate of the pulsational instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite found that rsg pulsations can achieve large amplitudes that may be comparable to those in agb stars when the pulsation periods become close to the thermal time scale of the envelope .",
    "they therefore suggested that such strong pulsations might lead to a `` superwind '' if the luminosity to mass ratio in a rsg were sufficiently high .",
    "this idea might be supported by observations .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the dust - enshrouded rsgs in the large magellanic cloud have a very high mass loss rate , which appears to be related to strong rsg pulsation  @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "we explore possible consequences of such a superwind in the evolution of supernova progenitors .",
    "our approach to this topic is as follows .",
    "first , we investigate the properties of rsg pulsations using our new stellar evolution models that follow the non - linear evolution of pulsation ( sect .",
    "[ sect : properties ] ) .",
    "this allows us to derive a relation between the pulsation growth rate and the structure of rsgs .",
    "second , we assume that the mass loss rate due to rsg winds should be significantly enhanced compared to that of jnh88 , when the growth rate of pulsation becomes sufficiently large",
    ". the consequent evolution of massive stars can be very different from the standard picture given in previous work ( sect .",
    "[ sect : evol ] ) . note that here we apply the modified mass loss prescription only to very unstable rsgs , while @xcite and @xcite considered overall enhancement of rsg mass loss rate for all types of rsgs .",
    "also , our mass loss prescription is more directly related to the pulsational properties of rsgs than the others that rely on surface luminosity and temperature .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper by discussing implications for supernova progenitors ( sect .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] ) .",
    "rsg pulsations are not usually found in stellar evolution models even if one uses a hydrodynamic code , for two reasons .",
    "first , in most stellar evolution calculations , the evolutionary time steps are much larger than the pulsation periods in rsgs , which are comparable to the dynamical time scale of the envelope .",
    "second , pulsations tend to be numerically damped out with the implicit method adopted in stellar evolution codes . however , the study by @xcite shows that the predictions of linear stability analysis for basic pulsational properties ( i.e. , pulsation period and growth rate ) can be accurately reproduced in non - linear evolutionary calculations of rsgs by a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code , if the growth rate is sufficiently large and if the adopted time steps are sufficiently small . on the other hand , non - linear evolutionary calculations do not require the condition of complete thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium of the star , in contrast to the case of linear stability analysis .",
    "we therefore decide to use an existing hydrodynamic stellar evolution code for our analysis of rsg pulsations .",
    "details of our implicit hydrodynamic code are described in @xcite and references therein .    to start with ,",
    "we construct non - rotating hydrostatic models at solar metallicity for 11 different initial masses ( 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 30 , 40  @xmath0 ) .",
    "since the hydrodynamic term in the momentum equation is switched off , pulsations do not appear in these model sequences .",
    "the hr diagrams for some model sequences are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] .",
    "then , we turn on the hydrodynamic term and restart the calculation from the reference models chosen at various evolutionary epochs during the supergiant phase for each model sequence . in total , 71 reference models are selected as starting points . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] , some of the starting points are shown , marked by filled circles and open diamonds . to guarantee enough time resolution for describing pulsations in the hydrodynamic calculations , we limit the time steps such that @xmath1 ^ 2[(15\\mathrm{m_\\odot})/m]~\\mathrm{yr}$ ] .",
    "this choice is based on the fact that pulsations of a rsg with @xmath2 have a period of the order of 1000 days ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and obey the relation of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pulsation period , @xmath5 the radius and @xmath6 the total mass of a rsg @xcite .",
    "an example of such calculations is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity ] .",
    "as the pulsation amplitude grows gradually , the surface velocity eventually reaches the sound speed .",
    "since our code can not describe shock waves , we investigate the pulsation properties only with the sub - sonic results .",
    "[ fig : hr ] shows the pulsation period @xmath4 and the growth rate @xmath7 of the fundamental mode at different reference points on the hr diagram . here",
    ", the growth rate is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes a local maximum of the surface velocity located at a certain time @xmath10 . according to this definition , pulsational instability means @xmath11 .",
    "the growth rate obtained here should be considered only indicative , given the limitations of our adopted numerical method .",
    "for example , in our calculations , no pulsation is detected from some reference points .",
    "this does not mean that the considered rsgs are stable against the pulsational instability , but that the growth rate is too small for our code to follow .",
    "also , in our calculations , instant adjustment of convective flux during pulsation is assumed , which is not physical given the similar time scales of convection and pulsation . despite these uncertainties , our results are qualitatively in good agreement with those of previous studies : the growth rate is generally higher for a larger luminosity to mass ratio ( @xmath12 ) , and/or for a smaller thermal time scale of the envelope . specifically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] , we find the following relation between the pulsation growth rate and the stellar structure from our results with the hydrodynamic model sequences : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) denotes the kelvin - helmoltz time scale of the hydrogen - rich envelope , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we confirm that rsgs are generally more susceptible to the pulsation instability for larger initial masses .",
    "[ fig : hr ] indicates that for @xmath18 , pulsations can become strong enough to be detected with our code even before the star reaches the hayashi line , while pulsations are only found after neon burning for @xmath19  @xmath0 .",
    "we do not find any signature of pulsation for @xmath20  @xmath0 than in our non - rotating models . ] .",
    "therefore , if a super - wind could be induced by strong pulsations , it would occur in an earlier evolutionary epoch for a higher mass star .",
    "if the mass loss rate were dramatically enhanced due to strong pulsations , how would it affect the evolution of supergiants , and what would be the observational consequences ?    to address this issue in more detail , we perform an experiment as the following .",
    "we assume that the mass loss rate of a supergaint is significantly enhanced compared to the rate of jnh88 , if pulsations are strong enough to be detected with our hydrodynamic stellar evolution code , i.e. if @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass loss rate of jnh88 , and @xmath23 a free parameter .",
    "new evolutionary model sequences are constructed , with this modified mass loss rate . here , the hydrodynamic term is switched off again , and normal evolutionary time steps are used .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the empirical mass loss rate of rsgs of jnh88 might already reflect the role of pulsations . however , as implied by the growth rates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] , only very unstable massive stars with @xmath24  @xmath0 are significantly affected by this modification .",
    "given the paucity of rsgs with @xmath2520 ",
    "25  @xmath0 in our galaxy and nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our assumption that the mass loss history of such very unstable rsgs can be qualitatively different from that of most rsgs in the sample of jnh88 does not necessarily cause an inconsistency .",
    "[ fig : evol ] shows the evolutionary tracks and the mass loss rates of model sequences with @xmath26 ( this choice for @xmath23 is rather arbitrary ) , compared to the corresponding ones with @xmath27 , for two different masses ( @xmath28 20 and 25  @xmath0 ) .",
    "two important points are worthy of notice here .",
    "first , as the star gradually loses mass , the @xmath12 ratio and the pulsation growth rate increase accordingly .",
    "if the value of @xmath23 is large enough ( as adopted here ) , this leads to a runaway increase in the mass loss rate as shown in the lower panel of the figure .",
    "second , the mass loss rate decreases very rapidly when the star moves away from the pulsationally unstable regime on the hr diagram .",
    "the peak of the mass loss rate is reached when the helium mass fraction at the centre decreases to 0.54 ( 0.031 ) , and the total mass to 9.35  @xmath0 ( 6.50  @xmath0 ) , for 25  @xmath0 ( 20  @xmath0 ) model sequence .",
    "as shown for the 20  @xmath0 sequence , such a mass loss history of runaway increase followed by sudden decrease can be repeated as the star moves in and out the unstable regime .",
    "the 20 @xmath0 star finally ends its life as a yellow supergiant of @xmath29  @xmath0 , with only a small amount of hydrogen of about 0.5  @xmath0 .",
    "the most likely outcome of the death of such a star would be a type iib supernova .",
    "the 25  @xmath0 star has a hydrogen envelope of 0.22  @xmath0 at core helium exhaustion , and would produce either a type ib or a iib supernova depending on the subsequent history of mass loss .    when the mass loss rate reaches the maximum , the growth rate given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) becomes as high as 11.3 and 10.6 for 25 and 20  @xmath0 models , respectively .",
    "we checked if non - linear evolutionary calculations also give such high growth rates , given that the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is only based on the result with @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] ) .",
    "we find that , at the reference points marked by the filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] , the hydrodynamic calculations give @xmath31 9.9 and 9.0 for 25 and 20 @xmath0 models respectively , which are comparable to the values given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "if a pulsationally - driven super - wind ( pdsw ) phase could be induced by strong pulsations , this would have very important implications for supernova progenitors . as implied by our model sequences presented above",
    ", such a pdsw can significantly reduce the critical zams mass ( @xmath32 ) above which a huge fraction of the stellar envelope is removed before core collapse , thus producing no type ii - p supernova . based on our results",
    ", we suggest @xmath33 19 ... 20@xmath0 with a pdsw ( see figs .  [ fig : hr ] and [ fig : evol ] ) , while the models with the jnh88 mass loss rate predict sn ii - p progenitors up to @xmath34 25@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , this value of @xmath32 is comparable to what other alternative prescriptions of rsg winds mass loss predict @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath32 could be even further reduced by rotation , as implied by the result of @xcite  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this might provide a plausible solution to the so - called rsg problem , i.e. the observed lack of type ii - p progenitors with @xmath35@xmath0@xcite .",
    "such observation could also result from the presence of dusty circumstellar material around the stars , as an obscured progenitor would be estimated to have a lower initial mass in pre - sn images .",
    "however @xcite also noted that the number of sne type",
    "ii - p in their sample is consistent with the expected number of stars in the range 8.5 - 16.5  @xmath0 assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "this could be a possible indication of the fact that stars with higher initial mass do actually lose most of their hydrogen envelope , which can not be easily understood with the canonical mass loss rate of jnh88 .",
    "the pdsw is expected to significantly affect the circumstellar medium around a rsg ( van veelen , in prep . ) .",
    "when the star dies , the shock produced by the collision between the sn ejecta and the circumstellar material transforms kinetic energy into thermal energy .",
    "this energy can be radiated away at different wavelengths , resulting in brightnening the supernova remnant for long times @xcite .",
    "if the collision occurs directly after the sn explosion , the emission can even alter the spectrum and light curve of the sn .",
    "this scenario is usually invoked to explain the sub - class of type iin supernovae @xcite . to reproduce the light curve of the most luminous type iin supernovae ( sne iin ) like sn 2006gy and sn 2006tf ,",
    "very massive shells are required , which need to be ejected in eruptive events a few years before core collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "pulsational pair instability @xcite and lbv - like eruptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been discussed to explain the presence of shells of 10 - 25@xmath0 around the progenitors of luminous sne iin .",
    "a pdsw phase is an unlikely explanation for such extreme environments",
    ". however it might be interesting for those type iin where the required mass in the stellar vicinity is of the order of a few solar masses or less .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to consider the circumstellar medium around the rsg vy cma .",
    "the stellar surrounding appears shaped by episodic mass ejections which occurred about 500 - 1000 yr ago @xcite .",
    "the complex morphology of the csm is suggestive of a possible interaction between convection and pulsation ( see fig .  13 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which for these stars are predicted to occur on similar timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mass loss rate of @xmath36 derived by @xcite is comparable to the one expected during the pdsw phase ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : evol ] ) .",
    "even if the mass loss prescription for pdsw we used is somewhat arbitrary , we want to stress that the energy available from the growth of pulsation is enough to drive mass loss rates up to @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite state that an extreme rsg like vy cma would produce a type iin event like sn 1988z if it were to explode in its current state .",
    "therefore the occurrence of pulsation - driven super - winds in rsg might explain moderately luminous sn iin if the enhanced mass loss takes place less than about @xmath38 years before core collapse . with the mass loss prescription of eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] with a sufficiently large @xmath23 ( @xmath39 ) , this would occur in a narrow range around @xmath3419@xmath0 for non - rotating stars .",
    "an accurate determination of the expected rate of type iin due to pdsw requires a more realistic mass loss prescription .    to conclude ,",
    "if a pulsationally - driven super - wind phase could be induced by strong pulsations , we would expect a substantial change in the late evolution of single massive stars .",
    "the mass loss rate during the rsg phase would increase dramatically for stars with @xmath40 compared to the jnh88 rate , and the pdsw phase should start earlier in the evolution of more massive stars .",
    "the resulting pre - supernova structure of these stars is affected , as well as their csm .",
    "for single stars , this suggests the following sequence in supernova types as function of increasing initial mass : ii - p  @xmath41  ii - l  @xmath41  iin  @xmath41  iib  @xmath41  ib  @xmath41  ic .",
    "detailed estimate for the mass range of each supernova requires a better prescription for the pulsationally enhanced mass loss , which deserves further study ."
