    "measuring the surface composition of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) may provide clues about the composition and environment of the primordial solar nebula as well as the important evolutionary processes occurring in the outer solar system over the last 4.5 gyr .",
    "unfortunately , there are only a handful of kbos that are known to exhibit ice absorption bands in their spectra .",
    "h@xmath2o - ice bands are seen in spectra of 1996 to66 @xcite , varuna @xcite , quaoar @xcite , and orcus @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath0-ice bands are seen in spectra of pluto @xcite , neptune s satellite triton , which may be a captured kbo @xcite , eris @xcite , and 2005 fy9 @xcite .",
    "there are perhaps a dozen objects that exhibit spectra with no ice absorption bands @xcite    the recent discovery of extraordinarily bright and large kbos opens up a new opportunity for the physical and chemical studies of kbo surfaces with high signal precision optical reflectance spectroscopy .",
    "bright objects make it possible to either carry out in - depth physical modeling of ice and mineralogical absorption bands or set stringent upper limits on the presence of such bands .    here",
    "we present high signal precision optical reflectance spectra of kbos 2005 fy9 and 2003 el61 .",
    "both objects are candidates for membership in the newly defined class `` dwarf planet . ''",
    "the diameter of 2005 fy9 is estimated at 1600 km @xcite while 2003 el61 appears to be a highly elongated ellipsoid with axes of 1950 @xmath3 2500 km @xcite .",
    "for comparison , pluto has a diameter of 2350 km .",
    "2005 fy9 and 2003 el61 are among `` scattered - near '' objects ( i.e. non - resonant , non - planet - crossing objects with tisserand parameters less than 3 , relative to neptune ) in the deep ecliptic survey classification system @xcite . 2005 fy9 has a perihelion distance , q , of 38.6 au , an aphelion distance , q , of 52 au , a semi - major axis , a , of 45.3 au , an inclination angle to the ecliptic , i , of 29@xmath4 , and an eccentricity of 0.15 .",
    "2003 el61 has q @xmath5 35.1 au , q @xmath5 51 au , a @xmath5 43.1 au , i @xmath5 28@xmath4 , and e @xmath5 0.18 for comparison , pluto has q @xmath5 29.7 au , q @xmath5 49 au , a @xmath5 39.5 au , i @xmath5 17@xmath4 , and e @xmath5 0.25 . at the time of observation ,",
    "2005 fy9 and 2003 el61 were both near aphelion .",
    "we obtained spectra of 2005 fy9 and 2003 el61 on 2006 march 5 ut with the 6.5-meter mmt telescope on mt .",
    "hopkins , az , the red channel spectrograph , and a 1200 @xmath3 800 ccd . a 150 g mm@xmath6 grating and a 1 arc sec slit width provided wavelength coverage of 5000 to 9500    in first order , a dispersion of 6.38   pixel@xmath6 , and a fwhm resolution of 20.0  .",
    "a lp495 blocking filter eliminated contamination from the second order .",
    "there were high , thin cirrus clouds through most of the night and the seeing was @xmath7 0.8 arc sec .",
    "the kbos were placed at the center of the slit and tracked at kbo rates .",
    "we used the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) and standard procedures @xcite to calibrate and extract one - dimensional spectra from the two - dimensional spectral images .",
    "specifically , the electronic bias of each image was removed by subtracting its overscan as well as a bias picture .",
    "pixel to pixel sensitivity variations were removed from each image by dividing by a normalized twilight flatfield image .",
    "extraction of one - dimensional spectra from the images was done with the apall task in iraf .",
    "henear spectra were used to correct for flexure and obtain an accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "our wavelengths are accurate to @xmath7 one - tenth of a pixel or @xmath7 0.7  .",
    "we removed telluric bands and fraunhofer lines from the kbo spectra by observing the solar analog hd 112257 @xcite at airmasses very close to 2005 fy9 and 2003 el61 , and then then dividing the kbo spectra by the normalized solar analog spectra . typically , the airmass difference between the kbos and the solar analog was @xmath8 0.05 .",
    "the 2005 fy9 and 2003 el61 spectra in the analysis below are an average of four 10-minute and five 10-minute exposures , respectively .",
    "we plot our reflectance spectrum of 2005 fy9 in figure 1 ( bottom ) .",
    "the tick marks correspond to previously reported absorption maxima of ch@xmath0-ice ( table 1 ) .",
    "the middle and top spectra in figure 1 are of 2005 fy9 @xcite and pluto @xcite .",
    "all spectra are normalized to 1 at 6500  . for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "the @xcite 2005 fy9 and pluto spectra are offset by 0.4 and 0.8 , respectively . clearly , 2005 fy9 exhibits much deeper ch@xmath0-ice bands than pluto .",
    "our spectrum differs from the @xcite spectrum in two ways .",
    "first , our spectrum exhibits additional subtle absorption bands at 5400 , 5800 , and 6000  .",
    "these bands have not been seen before in astronomical or laboratory spectra of ch@xmath0-ice .",
    "because the bands are close to the wavelengths of gas phase ch@xmath0 bands and because there are strong ch@xmath0-ice bands at longer wavelengths in the spectrum of 2005 fy9 , we think the new bands are due to ch@xmath0-ice .",
    "in addition , it appears the band at 6200   is ch@xmath0-ice as well .",
    "it is in the @xcite spectrum , but they do not identify it as ch@xmath0-ice .",
    "second , we find a continuum slope between 5500 and 6500   of 10%/1000  while @xcite find a slope of 13%/1000 , with both spectra normalized to 1 at 6500  .",
    "we used hd 112257 , a g2v star , for our solar analog star whereas @xcite used bs 4486 , a g0v star , for their solar analog star .",
    "an examination of the v@xmath9r colors for g0v and g2v stars suggests the slope difference is due to the use of different solar analog stars .    in order to place constraints on the ch@xmath0 grain size as well as the presence of any additional ice components on the surface of 2005 fy9 , we calculated model ch@xmath0-ice spectra .",
    "our models use laboratory optical constants for pure ch@xmath0-ice at 30 k @xcite and arbitrary optical constants that absorb more at blue than red wavelengths , and thereby reproduce the observed reddish slope for the 2005 fy9 continuum .",
    "the ice and reddening agent were mixed in the model at the molecular level ( i.e. by means of a weighted average of the ice and reddening agent optical constants ) .",
    "we used hapke theory @xcite to transform the optical constants into reflectance spectra .",
    "we used hapke parameters h @xmath100.1 , b@xmath11 @xmath5 0.8 , @xmath12 @xmath5 30@xmath4 , and p(g ) @xmath5 a two component henyey - greenstein function with 80% in the forward scattering lobe and 20 % in the back scattering lobe and both lobes having asymmetry parameter 0.63 .",
    "these values are comparable to numbers used previously to model the surface of pluto @xcite .",
    "figure 2 compares the spectrum of 2005 fy9 ( black line ) and a hapke model with a grain size of 0.55 cm ( red line ) .",
    "although the model fits the core of the 8897   band , it has too little absorption at all the other bands .",
    "next , we fit the core of the weaker 7296   band with a 1.8 cm grain size .",
    "then , we fit the core of the even weaker 8000   complex with a 2.5 cm grain size .",
    "these models illustrate a trend , weaker bands ( which see deeper into the surface ) aways seem to need bigger grain sizes , or equivalently , greater optical path lengths in ch@xmath0-ice .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear a single grain size will not fit the observations . in figure 3 , we present a hapke model that uses two grain sizes , 6 cm ( 97 % by volume ) and 0.1 cm ( 0.03 % by volume ) , in an intimate mixture . the inability of the two - grain size model to fit the ch@xmath0-ice band at wavelengths less than 7000   in figure 3 is due to the lack of laboratory optical constants .",
    "we note that our two - grain size model is not a unique solution .",
    "although this model fits the data , other models ( such as courser grains underneath a coating of finer grains ) would probably fit the data just as well .",
    "in addition , it is important to realize that grain sizes larger than 1 cm are probably a measure of the spacing of fractures or voids in the solid surface rather than indicating a surface covered by golf - ball sized particles .",
    "although we can fit the shape and depth of the absorptions , there is a small but significant difference between our models and the telescope data .",
    "specifically , the maxima of the ch@xmath0 absorption bands in the spectrum of 2005 fy9 reside blueward of the maxima in the pure ch@xmath0 hapke models . in figure 4",
    ", we present a small portion of figure 3 centered on the 7296   band to illustrate the shift .",
    "such a shift is important because laboratory experiments show that the 8897 , 8968 , and 9019   bands in spectra of pure ch@xmath0-ice are shifted blueward by 27   in a ch@xmath0/n@xmath2 @xmath5 0.8 % mixture @xcite .",
    "another experiment finds the 8897   band shifts @xmath7 17   in a ch@xmath0/n@xmath2 @xmath5 20 % ice mixture @xcite .",
    "a cross correlation experiment provides a way to quantify the apparent shift in figure 3 .",
    "specifically , we wrote a fortran program to shift the model spectrum from @xmath9 25 to @xmath1325   in 1   steps . for each shift , the program finds the difference between the data and model , i.e. it calculates @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the ordinate values of the data and the model spectra at wavelength i. then , the program sums the squares of the difference over all n wavelength points between 7000 and 9300  . in other words",
    ", we calculate    @xmath17    in figure 5 , we present a plot of the sums of the squares of the differences , i.e. @xmath18 , as function of shift .",
    "we find a well defined minimum at 3.25  .",
    "what is the uncertainty in the 3.25   measurement ?",
    "we note that henear spectra enable us to calibrate the wavelengths in the 2005 fy9 spectrum to an uncertainty of @xmath7 1/10 of a pixel or @xmath7 0.7  . specifically , we find the average difference between the centroids of airglow lines in our data and the corresponding laboratory values is 0.7  . a larger source of uncertainty comes from the noise in the spectra and the broadness of the cross correlation minimum in figure 5 .",
    "propagation of the noise in the data and model spectra for the 3   shift through equation ( 1 ) gives an ordinate error bar for the minimum point ( 3.25 , 2.218 ) in figure 5 of 0.042 . as a result",
    ", the uncertainty in our shift measurement is defined by @xmath18 @xmath19 2.218 @xmath13 0.042 @xmath5 2.260 ( i.e. the section of the curve below the dashed line in figure 5 ) , corresponding to shifts between 1 and 5.5  . in short ,",
    "we find the ch@xmath0-ice bands in the spectrum of 2005 fy9 are blueshifted relative to the model hapke spectrum by 3.25 @xmath1 2.25  .",
    "@xcite gave blueshifts of 2 - 6   for ch@xmath0 bands in their table 1 , but they questioned the reality of the shifts because they are so small .",
    "our independent measurement of shifts with similar magnitude bolsters the case for the reality of the small shifts .",
    "in fact , when we take the @xcite data and do a cross correlation experiment between our spectrum and their spectrum , we find no measurable shift between the spectra ; but when we perform a cross correlation experiment between their spectrum and the hapke model , we find their ch@xmath0-ice bands are blue shifted 2   relative to the model . our spectrum and the @xcite spectrum are consistent .",
    "we plot our reflectance spectrum of 2003 el61 in figure 6 .",
    "the continuum has a slope of essentially zero , consistent with b@xmath9v @xmath5 0.63 @xmath1 0.03 and v@xmath9r @xmath5 0.34 @xmath1 0.02 @xcite .",
    "evidently , tholins are not present on the surface of 2003 el61 at an abundance seen on 2005 fy9 .",
    "( recall that both objects were observed on the same night and compared against the same solar analog spectrum . )",
    "we find no evidence of ch@xmath0-ice bands , but we can set an upper limit on the thickness of a global glaze of ch@xmath0-ice by applying beer s law ,    @xmath20    to the continuum near the 8897   band . in the above equation , t is the thickness of the glaze , a@xmath21 are the lambert absorption coefficients for ch@xmath0-ice @xcite , the factor of two comes about because light passes through the glaze once on the way in and once on the way back out , ( i / i@xmath11)@xmath21 is the ratio of light leaving the glaze to the light incident on the glaze . for ( i / i@xmath11)@xmath22 @xmath5 0.97 , we find t @xmath19 0.3 mm .",
    "h@xmath2o - ice bands are seen in near - infrared spectra of 2003 el61 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to look for evidence of solid - state photolytic or radiolytic chemistry @xcite by seeing if o@xmath2-ice is present on the surface of 2003 el61 . in figure 6 , we superimpose the 5773 and 6275   o@xmath2-ice bands in spectra of ganymede @xcite on top of our 2003 el61 spectrum .",
    "there is a tantalizing dip at 5773   in the spectrum of 2003 el61 , but no dip at the weaker 6275   band .",
    "the continuum signal precision at the position of these bands is about 150 and so if the 5773   band is real , it would take a continuum signal precision of about 300 to detect the 6275 band .",
    "we estimate an upper limit to the thickness of a global glaze of o@xmath2-ice by assuming the possible feature at 5773   is real and then applying beer s law as we did for ch@xmath0-ice . for ( i / i@xmath11)@xmath23 @xmath5 0.99 and a@xmath24 @xmath5 5.5 cm@xmath6 , we find t @xmath19 0.01 mm .",
    "our value for a@xmath24 comes from an integrated absorption coefficient of 1.1 @xmath3 10@xmath26 @xmath27 and a band fwhm of @xmath7 200 cm@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our spectrum of 2005 fy9 exhibits strong ch@xmath0-ice bands in agreement with the spectrum of @xcite . from a comparison of our spectrum and a hapke model , we find the 2005 fy9 ch@xmath0-ice bands are shifted 3.25 @xmath1 2.25   blueward relative to the positions of pure ch@xmath0-ice bands .",
    "the shift could be due to the presence of another ice - component , possibly n@xmath2-ice , co - ice , or ar .",
    "future higher resolution spectra of the individual ch@xmath0 bands should determine if the weaker bands which penetrate deeper into the surface exhibit different shifts than the stronger bands which do not penetrate as deep into the surface .",
    "such observations could provide a technique to measure the ch@xmath0 concentration relative to the other ice component as a function of depth below the surface of 2005 fy9 .",
    "in addition , it is highly desirable to obtain a measure of the shift as a function of rotational longitude on 2005 fy9 for a particular ch@xmath0-ice band .",
    "such a technique could provide a measure of inhomogeneity on the surface of 2005 fy9 .",
    "@xcite made such measurements for the 8897   band on pluto and found that the blueshift varied from 0 to 10   over the surface .    on pluto",
    ", it appears n@xmath2 is sufficiently mobile to form textures that allow incoming photons to travel several centimeters through the very transparent , polycrystalline n@xmath2-ice before the photons are scattered off inclusions or grain boundaries .",
    "the long pathlengths make it possible for a small amount of ch@xmath0 relative to n@xmath2 to give deep ch@xmath0 absorption bands .",
    "the mobility of co is only a little less than n@xmath2 , and the mobility of ar is only a little less than co. therefore , it is possible that co - ice or ar - ice could provide the host matrix for long optical pathlengths .",
    "it is also possible the host matrix is a combination of n@xmath2 , co , and ar .",
    "a suite of laboratory experiments that measure the shifts of ch@xmath0 absorption maxima for different concentrations of ch@xmath0 relative to n@xmath2 , co , and ar would be highly valuable for the future interpretation of observational data .",
    "our spectrum of 2003 el61 is remarkably featureless .",
    "there is a hint of a band at 5773   possibly due to o@xmath2-ice .",
    "future work will attempt to double the signal precision of the continuum to at least 300 , which is the level that appears to be required for any possible detection of the weaker o@xmath2-ice band at 6275  .",
    "the detection of o@xmath2-ice in significant quantities on kbos could be of considerable interest in the distant future as a source of spacecraft fuel .",
