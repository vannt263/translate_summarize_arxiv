    "the old open cluster ngc6791 is a critically important object for the study of stellar evolution , the galactic age - metallicity relation , and population synthesis .",
    "it is one of the two or three oldest of the known open clusters ( phelps , janes , & montgomery 1994 ) , yet it has the highest metallicity ( friel & janes 1993 ; garnavich _ et al . _  1994 ; peterson & green 1998 ) , making it a unique local example of the kind of old , metal - rich population expected in the centers of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges .",
    "it is also one of the most populous of all the open clusters ( kauny & udalski 1992 ) . as a result",
    ", ngc6791 has been more intensively studied than any other old disk cluster except m67 .",
    "numerous color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) investigations ( kinman 1965 ; anthony - twarog & twarog 1985 ; kauny 1990 ; kauny & udalski 1992 ; kauny & rucinski 1993 ; montgomery , janes , & phelps 1994 ; garnavich _ et al . _  1994 ; kauny & rucinski 1995 ) , isochrone studies ( demarque , green , & guenther 1992 ; meynet _ et al . _  1993",
    "; carraro _ et al . _  1994",
    "; tripicco _ et al._1995 ) and other photometric and spectroscopic investigations _",
    "e.g. _  ( harris & canterna 1981 ; liebert , saffer , & green 1994 ; twarog , ashman , & anthony - twarog 1997 ; eggen 1998 ) have attempted to constrain the reddening , distance modulus , and age , with often contradictory results .",
    "derived ages have ranged as low as 5.5 and as high as 12.5 gyr , given the uncertainties in the reddening ( @xmath10 ) and the composition ( both the metallicity and the assumed helium abundance ) .",
    "equally important , the use of a wide variety of theoretical isochrones and different transformations from theoretical  and  to observed cmd s have made it very difficult to compare the results obtained by various investigators ( friel 1995 ) .",
    "reliable ages , extinction and distances from isochrone fitting depend on several factors .",
    "first , the observational cmd s must be of very high quality : deep , photometrically accurate , well populated along the major sequences , and reasonably free of confusion from field stars or binaries .",
    "second , the stellar composition must be known fairly precisely , since any errors will result in compensating variations in , , and age .",
    "third , the effects of uncertainties in the isochrone input physics should be small compared to the desired accuracy of the cluster parameters to be fit . while this is now believed to be an achievable goal",
    ", it is difficult to estimate the true uncertainties in the isochrone input physics .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that even relatively large uncertainties , such as the accuracy of the opacity tables and the choice of mixing length , have only small effects on the derived ages , reddenings and distance moduli , as long as the isochrone fits are made to the main sequence and turnoff regions , and the models are properly calibrated to a standard solar model ( demarque , green , & guenther 1992 ) .",
    "finally , the theoretical quantities must be accurately transformed into the observational plane .",
    "this is especially important for high @xmath11 models , since metal - rich stars have high line blanketing which must be correctly included in the synthetic stellar atmospheres .",
    "the observational data are very good for ngc6791 .",
    "multiple , very precise cmd s are available in several colors ( see the references above ) .",
    "preliminary proper motion membership probabilities from cudworth s ( 1994 ) ongoing survey show a high degree of separation between cluster and field stars . as discussed in ",
    "[ composition ] , the metallicity question is now much closer to resolution following the first high dispersion abundance analysis of a cluster member ( peterson & green 1998 ) . we have chosen to further constrain the possible range of isochrone solutions by doing simultaneous fits in @xmath12 _ vs. _  and @xmath12 _ vs. _  , requiring that the distance modulus and reddening be the same in both cmd s .",
    "new theoretical isochrones have been computed (  [ sectmodel ] ) to match the observational data .",
    "recent improvements include the use of opal opacities , diffusion , and color transformations based on kurucz s new models . in a major advance , kurucz ( 1993 ) has published a new grid of synthetic model atmospheres with stellar abundances as high as six times solar metallicity , based on a comprehensive compilation of new atomic lines and molecular data .",
    "bessell , castelli , & plez ( 1998 ) have tested colors based on these atmospheres ( and other similar grids now being completed ) against fundamental color - temperature relations derived from several sources .",
    "they conclude that kurucz s new models fit stars hotter than 4250k very well for all ubvrijkl indices , at least for solar abundances .",
    "as we will demonstrate in  [ previous ] , the color transformation is undoubtedly one of the most important , and least discussed , uncertainties involved in isochrone fitting .    in  [ sectfits ]",
    ", we examine our isochrone fits to ngc6791 for a range of , , and age .",
    "we investigate the validity of our results (  [ compare ] ) by comparing our isochrones with 1 ) those used in previous investigations of ngc6791 , 2 ) hipparcos data for the moderately metal - rich hyades zams , and 3 ) bv and vi cmd s for the canonical solar metallicity cluster m67 .",
    "composition is one of the most crucial isochrone input parameters .",
    "unfortunately , the brightest stars in ngc6791 are all very cool , heavily - blanketed giants .",
    "though there is widespread agreement that their metallicity must be greater than solar , until recently there were only two spectroscopic determinations of [ fe / h ] , both from moderate resolution spectra .",

    "_  found @xmath13 \\approx + 0.22 $ ] from the ca  ii infrared triplet lines in eight giants .",
    "other investigators based their conclusions on calibrated photometric indices or isochrone fits to the color magnitude diagram .    a much more accurate metallicity",
    "has now been derived from a high resolution echelle spectrum of a probable blue horizontal branch star in ngc6791 , 2 - 17 ( peterson & green 1998 ) .",
    "this star is undoubtedly a cluster member , as it has a very strong - lined spectrum , 93% proper motion membership probability ( cudworth 1994 ) , a radial velocity within 2  of the cluster mean , and a surface gravity appropriate to its position in the cmd . the combination of high temperature ( @xmath14 ) and high metallicity in 2 - 17 lead to line strengths that are close to solar , reducing several sources of systematic bias .",
    "peterson & green find @xmath13 = + 0.4\\pm \\,0.1 $ ] , with nearly solar ratios of c , o , ca , and al , but enhancements of 0.20.3 dex in mg , si , and na , and + 0.5 in n.    a very important question is whether such high abundances should be considered representative of the cluster as a whole .",
    "peterson & green considered 2 - 17 to be a horizontal branch star , but could not rule out its being a very luminous , slowly rotating blue straggler . in either case , the values for iron and other heavy elements should reflect the primordial abundances , though c , n , and o , and possibly also na , mg , and al ( _ e.g. _  kraft 1994 ) , may have been altered by mixing .",
    "the  of 2 - 17 is not likely to be unusual for ngc6791 , given the evidence for star - to - star uniformity among the heavy element abundances found by hufnagel , smith , & janes ( 1995 ) .",
    "their spectroscopic indices for 29 red horizontal branch and giant branch members of ngc6791 showed no indication of significant variations in fe or ca , though there was evidence for some variation in cn band strengths .",
    "in fact , friel & janes results support a red giant metallicity somewhat higher than their published value .",
    "friel & janes [ fe / h ] values for individual stars are plotted against  in fig .",
    "( [ figfeh ] ) , which shows that their sample naturally divides into two groups .",
    "( kauny & rucinski s ( 1995 ) photometry was used for this plot , though montgomery _",
    "s ( 1994 ) photometry is nearly identical ) .",
    "the four coolest and most blanketed giants give consistently lower abundances than those in the hotter group .",
    "friel & janes were keenly aware of the problems associated with such cool stars : they noted that they could nt use three of their six indices for stars with ( ) @xmath15 1.45 , due to a non - linear dependence on color .",
    "similar problems might affect the remaining three indices for the coolest stars in a cluster as uniquely metal rich as ngc6791 , particularly since calibration standards did not exist for [ fe / h ] @xmath16 0 at ( ) @xmath15 1.3 ( see figs .",
    "1012 and 15 in friel 1987 ) .",
    "in contrast , the five hotter giants require little or no color extrapolation from the available high metallicity calibrators , and thus are likely to be more accurate .",
    "friel & janes values of [ fe / h ] for the hotter stars are fairly tightly clustered between + 0.25 and + 0.40 , with a weighted mean of @xmath17 .",
    "= + 0.4 , as shown in  [ sectmodel ] . ]",
    "this completely overlaps the range of [ fe / h ] found in 2 - 17 by peterson & green .",
    "the presence of molecular bands might also affect garnavich _",
    "s result , obtained by measuring equivalent widths of the ca  ii infrared triplet lines in very cool giants ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 , equivalent to @xmath20 ) .",
    "they determined @xmath0}$}}\\approx + 0.22 $ ] by extrapolating armandroff & dacosta s ( 1991 ) calibration to metallicities above solar . though they were careful to use only stars with no tio bands to avoid continuum problems ( olszewski _ et al . _",
    "1991 ) , cn bands in the same spectral region might cause a similar , though smaller , nonlinear effect .",
    "ngc6791 giants obviously have much less cn than the carbon star shown in olszewski _",
    "_ s fig .  5 , but",
    "carbon and especially nitrogen are observed to have high abundances in 2 - 17 . also , blanketing is not the only concern when using the ca  ii triplet lines to derive metallicity . as emphasized by rutledge , hesser , & stetson ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the dependence of the ca  ii equivalent widths on log  _ g _ and  for clusters of different  and ages is not well understood .",
    "furthermore , since it is not clear that the @xmath21}$ ] enrichment histories were the same for metal - poor _ v.s .",
    "_  metal - rich globulars ( carney 1996 ; rutledge _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , a linear extrapolation from halo to greater than solar metallicities is even more speculative .",
    "finally , we suggest that extremely high blanketing might also be responsible for the fact that ddo and washington photometric indices ( geisler , clari , & minniti 1991 ; piatti , clari , & abadi 1995 ; twarog , ashman , & anthony - twarog 1997 ) give consistently lower abundance estimates for ngc6791 than do spectroscopic techniques , although that lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "clearly , the safest course of action in this unusually high metallicity cluster is to concentrate on the hottest possible stars , to avoid as much as possible the effects of blanketing .    in the following section ,",
    "we take the high dispersion result , @xmath0}$}}= + 0.4 $ ] , as our starting point .",
    "at least some of the light elements seem to be even further enhanced , but adopting a specific heavy element distribution is not straightforward .",
    "peterson & green s results are somewhat ambiguous in the crucial oxygen abundance , and also the likely distribution depends on the origin of the heavy element enrichment . mixing on the giant branch",
    "is expected to be much less efficient at higher metallicities , but this is very uncertain without understanding the exact mechanism(s ) by which mixing occurs .",
    "finally , given the substantial age of this cluster , it is possible that type i supernovae did not have time to play as large a relative role as for younger , enriched clusters such as the hyades .",
    "due to these uncertainties , and the lack of suitable color transformation tables for enhanced [ @xmath22/fe ] values , we were limited to using scaled solar abundance ratios for all our isochrones .",
    "we will discuss the probable effects of this input assumption in  [ alpha ] .",
    "this leaves only the question of the assumed helium abundance , normally not considered to be a source of uncertainty for most open clusters , because near - solar values of  imply near - solar @xmath23 .",
    "observations of galactic and extragalactic h  ii regions have found @xmath24 ( pagel _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) and @xmath1 ( izotov , thuan & lipovetsky 1997 ) .",
    "an analysis of the spread in the main sequence for stars of different metallicities lead pagel & portinari ( 1998 ) to conclude that @xmath25 .",
    "the large majority of both the stellar and h  ii observations are in metal - poor systems , and so it is not clear what value of  is appropriate for metallicities as high as in ngc6791 .",
    "theoretical determinations of  depend strongly on the lowest initial mass limit needed for the formation of a black hole ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "for example , maeder ( 1992 ) found @xmath27 for @xmath26 in the range @xmath28 .",
    "our calibrated solar models imply @xmath29 ( see  [ sectmodel ] ) .",
    "there is little hope of obtaining a reliable independent helium measurement from the cluster itself .",
    "ngc6791 contains several hot , evolved stars , but these have such high  and log  _ g _ that their atmospheric helium abundances must have been significantly altered from the primordial value by diffusion and/or radiation pressure , as well as possible mixing on the red giant branch .",
    "in addition , most of the hot stars are probable binaries ( green _ et al._1999 ) , with the possibility of altered abundances through prior mass transfer or collisional mixing .",
    "an alternate technique for determining the helium abundance , the well - known r method ( iben 1968 ) , has only been calibrated for low metallicities appropriate for globular clusters ( buzzoni _ et al . _  1983",
    "; caputo _ et al . _  1987",
    "; bono _ et al . _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) have recently demonstrated that the value of y derived from such calibrations depends significantly on the details of the physics included in the theoretical models , and that the best currently available input physics imply unrealistic helium abundances for observed globular cluster r ratios .",
    "one could sidestep the problem of obtaining the true y , and simply use existing calibrations ( based on earlier input physics ) in order to rank different populations by their helium abundance , but there are further problems associated with metal - rich stars in old open clusters .",
    "for example , renzini ( 1994 ) constructed a modified r@xmath30 parameter using photometric data from the ogle microlensing survey for galactic bulge stars in baade s window ( paczynski _ et al . _",
    "r@xmath30 must be @xmath31 for the bulge stars , depending on the nature of the field star contamination . given @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the globular cluster m3",
    ", renzini determined that the helium abundance of the metal - rich bulge stars had to lie in the range 0.300.35 , corresponding to  between 2 and 3 .",
    "we can construct the same r@xmath30 for ngc6791 , using cudworth s proper motion sample and montgomery , janes & phelps ( 1994 ) vi photometry .",
    "the ` clump ' box contains 30 stars , all known radial velocity members ( peterson & green 1999 ) , while the fainter ` rgb ' box contains 34 stars whose radial velocity status is unknown . thus r@xmath30 could be as low as 0.88 , but could only be as high as 1.2 (= 2 ) in the unlikely event that more than 25% of the high probability rgb members turn out to be field stars .",
    "further difficulties include possible differences in the central concentrations of stars in the clump and rgb boxes ( the proper motion sample only includes stars relatively near the center of ngc6791 ) , and whether nine blue horizontal branch stars ( green _ et al . _  1998 ) should be added to the clump group for ngc6791 ( corresponding stars in the bulge were not considered , and paczynski _ et al .",
    "_ s fig .",
    "1 is not quite deep enough to show if they exist ) .",
    "even if the calculation of r@xmath30 for ngc6791 were straightforward , there is the contrasting case of m67 .",
    "the data for m67 are much less ambiguous , since proper motions and radial velocities exist for all of the relevant stars out to very large distances from the cluster center ( see  [ sectm67 ] ) , and all the horizontal branch stars are in the red giant clump .",
    "the resulting r@xmath30 ratio for m67 is surprisingly high , @xmath34 .",
    "this contradicts any reasonable scenario in which m67 s solar metallicity and ( presumably ) solar helium abundance ought to produce a value for r@xmath30 intermediate between m3 on the one hand , and ngc6791 and the bulge on the other hand .    it does nt help to consider a more classical definition of the r parameter , specifically r@xmath35 = the number of clump stars divided by the number of rgb+agb stars with luminosities brighter than the clump .",
    "minniti ( 1995 ) found r@xmath35 to be approximately 1.6 for both his sample of bulge stars and for several metal - rich disk globular clusters , whereas r@xmath35 for a typical metal - poor globular is 1.1 .",
    "for ngc6791 , r@xmath35 = 1.37 based on peterson & green s ( 1999 ) complete sample containing 26 clump stars and 19 rgb+agb stars .",
    "( or , r@xmath35 = 1.84 if the blue horizontal branch stars are included with the clump stars .",
    ") m67 has 7 clump and 9 rgb+agb stars for a corresponding r@xmath35 = 0.78 .",
    "the relative rankings of ngc6791 and m67 are reversed from the previous case with r@xmath30 .",
    "clearly , small number statistics and/or the underlying metallicity and age dependences make it very difficult to determine even relative helium abundances in metal - rich old open clusters using the r method .    other methods for estimating y in clusters , _",
    "e.g. _  the difference in magnitude between the turnoff and horizontal branch ( caputo _ et al._1983 ) , are even more poorly suited for use in very metal - rich clusters or are more model dependent than the r method . given the uncertainty in the true value of the helium abundance in ngc6791 , we have elected to consider a range of values from @xmath9 to 3 .",
    "stellar evolution tracks for masses in the range @xmath36 ( in @xmath37 increments ) were calculated using the yale stellar evolution code ( guenther _ et al . _",
    "these models incorporate the latest available input physics : high temperature opacities from iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) ; low temperature opacities from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) ; nuclear reaction rates from bahcall & pinsonneault ( 1992 ) and bahcall ( 1989 ) ; helium diffusion coefficients from michaud & proffitt ( 1993 ) ; and an equation of state which includes the debye - hckel correction ( guenther _ et al . _",
    "note that this equation of state yields stellar models which are in good agreement with those derived using the opal equation of state ( rogers 1994 ; chaboyer & kim 1995 ) .",
    "the stellar models employ a solar calibrated mixing length .",
    "the models were typically evolved from the zero age main sequence to the upper giant branch in @xmath38 time steps . in each time step , the stellar evolution equations were solved with a numerical accuracy exceeding 0.01% .",
    "the models did not include any overshooting beyond the formal edge of the convection zones .",
    "main sequence and turnoff stars in clusters as old as ngc6791 do not have convective cores , and therefore identical ages are obtained with or without convective overshooting .",

    "the simplest explanation would be a calibration problem involving mjp s fainter stars , although we ca nt see why this should be the case .",

    "the fact that some isochrones are unable to simultaneously match the  and  data demonstrates the power of using multi - color photometry in performing these fits .",
    "it is interesting to note that the isochrones predict giant branches that are too blue compared to the  data and too red compared to the  data .    the excellent agreement between our metal - rich isochrones and the kr95 and ku data at all points along the major sequences leads us to conclude that colors and magnitudes derived using opal opacities and kurucz s ( 1993 ) model atmospheres are very good indeed .",
    "in addition , the derived cluster parameters are fairly robust to the above variations in composition .",
    "all of the acceptable fits indicate that @xmath60 , @xmath6 and that the age of ngc6791 is @xmath7gyr .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the derived reddening and distance modulus , with the larger reddening solutions requiring larger distance moduli .",
    "the heavy element abundance is consistent with both peterson & green s value for 2 - 17 and friel & janes value for red horizontal branch stars , with a probable @xmath8 between 1 and 3 .",

    "this suggestion has been confirmed by other authors ( chaboyer sarajedini & demarque 1992 ; salaris & weiss 1998 ) .",
    "if comparable @xmath22 enhancements are present in ngc6791 , our fits might overestimate the metallicity by this amount .",

    "3 ) , while the main sequence and turnoff continue to be shifted dimmer and cooler .",
    "it is important to note that the vandenberg & irwin ( 1997 ) comparison was done in the theoretical plane , while salaris & weiss ( 1998 ) used the same ( scaled solar ) color transformations for their scaled solar and @xmath22-enhanced isochrones .",
    "thus , these studies are unable to determine how enhancing the @xmath22 elements affects the appearance of the isochrones in the observational plane .",
    "it was the lack of a suitable color transformation for @xmath22 element enhanced mixtures which led us to consider only scaled solar compositions .",
    "it is likely that adopting a non - scaled solar mixture would have an impact on the calculated isochrones , and the parameters derived from them ( such as the reddening and age of ngc6791 ) .",
    "however , we note that the elemental abundance analysis of peterson & green ( 1998 ) found nearly solar ratios of o and ca ( two of the @xmath22 elements ) , while other @xmath22 elements ( mg and si ) were enhanced by @xmath61 dex .",
    "although it can be argued that the presently observed abundance of o in the evolved star observed by peterson & green ( 1998 ) has been affected by mixing in earlier evolution stages , the same is not true for ca .",
    "thus , the observational evidence for stellar compositions which are enhanced in the @xmath22 elements is not clear cut in ngc6791 .",
    "enhancing the @xmath22 elements by a modest 0.2 dex is unlikely to change the isochrones dramatically .",
    "the robustness of the above fits to variations in  of @xmath62 dex implies a similar robustness to @xmath63 $ ] enhancements of order of 0.2 dex .",
    "detailed models and more complete observational data will be required to investigate this further .",
    "having concluded that our models fit ( most of ) the data very well , it is worth examining the differences between our results and those of previous investigators .",
    "table  1 lists recent age determinations for ngc6791 .",
    "most of the ages were determined by fitting isochrones to the main sequence and turnoff regions in @xmath12 _ vs. _  , except for carraro _ et al . _",

    "the effects of different compositions were considered in the previous section and are clearly too small to be the cause of this difference .",
    "therefore , we now consider the effects of different opacity and color transformation tables .",

    "this is due to the difference between laol and opal opacities and the fact that our models , unlike tripicco _",
    "_ s , include helium diffusion .",
    "the differences are quite small , as would be expected whenever different sets of stellar evolutionary models are properly calibrated to the sun ( demarque _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) .",
    "in contrast , the differences in  and  between the new kurucz - based colors and those based on the older marcs atmospheres are substantial for all parts of the color magnitude diagram ( fig.[tripicco ] ) .",
    "this illustrates the profound effect of using synthetic model atmospheres that reproduce real stellar flux distributions .",
    "we expect that previous isochrone fits to other clusters using the older synthetic colors will be similarly affected , although the differences appear to be a function of metallicity .",
    "reid ( 1998 ) points out the the corresponding consequences for globular cluster main sequences and turnoffs , comparing dantona , caloi , & mazzitelli s ( 1997 ) isochrones , which also used kurucz ( 1993 ) color transformations , with those of vandenberg ( 1985 ) , based on vandenberg & bell s ( 1985 ) colors . as discussed by bessell _",
