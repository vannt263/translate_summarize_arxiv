    "in the past decade , the problem of swimming in a low reynolds number environment has attracted much attention from biology , physics , applied mathematics , computer science , chemistry , and mechanical engineering .",
    "many kinds of motile unicellular micro - organisms living in the world of low reynolds number @xcite use a variety of strategies to propel themselves in liquids .",
    "so far most of the studies have been directed towards organisms employing flagellum and cilium activity .",
    "some typical examples are spermatozoa  @xcite , bacteria such as _ e. coli _  @xcite and _ bacillus subtilis _  @xcite ( examples of the so - called pusher ) , algae like _ chlamydomonas reinhardtii _ ( an example of puller )  @xcite , _ volvox _  @xcite and _ paramecium _  @xcite ( examples of neutral swimmers ) .",
    "there has also been great interest in designing artificial microswimmers driven by different external fields , such as a rotating magnetic field  @xcite , a catalytic reaction field  @xcite , and so on .",
    "another category of swimmers , much less studied until now , employ amoeboid swimming ( as ) .",
    "amoeboid movement is the most common mode of locomotion in eukaryotic cells ( monocytes , neutrophils , macrophages , cancerous cells , etc . ) .",
    "the denomination _ amoeboid motion _ generically refers to motility due to shape deformation , and can be performed in a solution ( like swimming ) or on a substratum ( crawling ) . _",
    "eutreptiella gymnastica _",
    "@xcite , a common representative of euglenids of marine phytoplankton , is a prototypical example of an amoeboid swimmer . on the other hand , many eukaryotic cells , such as leucocytes , fibroblasts , etc .",
    ", which use ample membrane deformation for motility have been categorized as crawlers , that is , as micro - organisms which use focal adhesion on a substratum to move forward . crawling has been extensively studied in the biological and biophysical literatures  @xcite for it plays an essential role in many physiological and pathological processes including embryonic development , wound healing , immune response and cancer metastasis .",
    "it must be emphasized that there is yet no general consensus about the _amoeboid_ denomination for crawling cells .",
    "some authors make a distinction between amoeboid cells and mesenchymal cells , where in the latter category the adhesion is so strong that the shape change may be minor and not appearing as a predominant factor for motion ( see references @xcite ) .",
    "it has been seen that sometimes a cell may switch from mesenchymal to amoeboid motion under confinement @xcite . in the present study amoeboid motion",
    "refers to any motion that requires a shape change to move forward .",
    "several recent studies have been directed toward elucidating the role of focal adhesion in the migration process .",
    "one such study revealed that adhesion - based crawling is not necessarily a pre - requisite for cell locomotion once leukocytes transmigrate across the endothelium @xcite .",
    "adhesion molecules would then serve only to stop moving leucocytes in the blood stream , making them adhere to the endothelium before transmigration .",
    "studies _ in vitro _ have shown that integrins ( the principal cell adhesion molecules ) do not contribute to migration in three - dimensional environments ( in suspension with fibrous material , mimicking extracellular matrix of tissues)@xcite .",
    "instead these cells migrate using actin polymerization , which leads to membrane protrusion on the leading front .",
    "it is debated@xcite as to whether or not cell contact with fibrous material , without any specific adhesion , is necessary in order to assist locomotion .",
    "a more recent study supports the idea of pure swimming in cells of the immune system ( neutrophils ) , and in dictyostelium @xcite ; it has been found that these cells , when far from the substrate , move toward a chemo - attractant .",
    "a remarkable result shows that they can swim @xcite with speeds of comparable magnitude to those on a solid substrate ( crawling ) .",
    "other recent experimental studies focused @xcite on cell motion in a confined geometry showed that a blebbing cell can undergo movement through nonspecific adhesion , but only thanks to a solid - like friction from the substrate . in other words",
    ", this corresponds to a situation where the cell is in `` physical '' contact with the substrate on which the cell might lean , in a fashion similar to the case of a cell leaning on a fibrous ( or extracellular ) material , but with no specific adhesion needed .",
    "the above studies strongly support the idea that adhesion is not necessary for migration . in some reported cases @xcite cells",
    "may even bypass contact with the substrate and perform pure swimming in a fluid .",
    "there seems thus to be a whole spectrum of possibilities relevant for cell migration , ranging from specific - adhesion assisted crawling , through pure non - specific friction with an elastic substratum , up to pure swimming in a solution .",
    "thus an important task in research concerns bridging the gaps between pure swimming and motion by physical contact ( solid - like friction ) , up to crawling .",
    "our goal is to first isolate different effects and then progressively increase the degree of complexity to reveal the imbricated nature of cell motility . to this end , we have systematically analyzed amoeboid motion in the pure swimming case and studied the effect of bounding walls . though there is no direct friction ( no contact ) with walls , the fluid between the swimmer and the walls serves as a support for transmitting frictional forces between the swimmer and the walls .",
    "it must be noted , however , that while confinement ( if not too strong in our case ) promotes migration , the presence of bounding walls is not required ; motility can take place in a completely unbounded medium , provided that the shape change is not reversible in time , as required by the purcell s scallop theorem @xcite .",
    "several models of directed self - propulsion by large shape deformation have been explored in the literature  @xcite . in two recent studies we introduced a model in which @xcite the swimmer",
    "is considered as made of an inextensible membrane enclosing a constant volume of liquid and exerting a set of normal forces leading to deformations of the swimmer and to propulsion . the first study @xcite dealt with purely unconfined three dimensional ( 3d ) geometry ; the more recent work was dedicated to a confined swimmer in two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite , a situation revealing several puzzling phenomena which we will look at later .",
    "here we report on several new issues emerging for a confined amoeboid swimmer .",
    "for example , we show that the velocity of migration has a nontrivial scaling with the force and address the notion of efficiency by testing two definitions .",
    "we shall see , for example , that for certain confinement , the efficiency attains an optimal value .",
    "we will discuss the space - scanning capability of the swimmer , where we find that generally the swimmer can scan about @xmath5 of the available space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ intromodel ] , we present a minimal model for as . in section [ method ] the two numerical methods used in this study",
    "are briefly detailed : the boundary integral method ( bim )  @xcite and the immersed boundary method ( ibm )  @xcite . in section [ axialswim ] , we present the main results regarding an axially moving swimmer . in section [ vnomono ]",
    "we discuss both the peculiar behavior of the velocity as a function of confinement and the power consumption problem .",
    "section [ effic ] analyzes the swimmer efficiency .",
    "section [ various ] is devoted to different dynamical motions .",
    "conclusions and perspectives constitute the subject of section [ conclusion ] .",
    "some technical details are given in an appendix .",
    "for simplicity , and due to the high computational cost , we consider a 2d geometry . an amoeboid swimmer ( as ) is modeled as a membrane immersed in a newtonian fluid domain of a given viscosity @xmath3 .",
    "the encapsulated fluid is taken to have the same viscosity , for simplicity .",
    "we consider the pure stokes regime ( no inertia ) . an effective radius of the swimmer is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the enclosed area .",
    "we define an excess perimeter ( excess counted from a circular shape ) @xmath8 to describe the degree of deflation of swimmer shape .",
    "@xmath9 represents a circular shape , whereas a large @xmath10 refers to a swimmer with ample shape deformations .",
    "the perimeter @xmath11 of the swimmer membrane is taken to be constant due to the inextensibility of the membrane .",
    "extensible membranes can be dealt with as well , but our goal is to consider a minimal model from which to capture basic features before refinement .",
    "the swimmer is confined between two rigid walls separated by a distance @xmath12 .",
    "we impose the no - slip boundary condition at the walls . a schematic representation of the studied system with some useful notations is shown in fig . [ scheme ] .",
    "( color online ) a schematic representation of the system and some useful notations .",
    "the swimmer has internal area @xmath7 and perimeter @xmath11 . ]",
    "we consider certain forces deployed by the swimmer s internal machinery , with a certain distribution at the membrane . these are called the active forces and denoted as @xmath13 , and",
    "depend on the position of a material point of the membrane and on time ( see below ) .",
    "the active forces have a natural tendency to expand ( or compress ) the membrane which will resist thanks to its intrinsic cohesive forces , resulting in a tension - like reaction .",
    "since we are considering a purely incompressible membrane , the tension is such that the local arclength should remain constant in the course of time .",
    "the total force density ( force per unit area ) at the membrane is thus composed of an active part and a passive part , and can be written as @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the active force specified below and which we take to be directed along the normal direction , with @xmath16 denoting the unit normal vector .",
    "@xmath17 is a lagrange multiplier that enforces local membrane inextensibility , @xmath18 is the curvature , @xmath19 is the unit tangent vector , and @xmath20 is the arclength . stresses ( due to flow and active forces ) vary , in general , from one membrane point to another , so the membrane deploys a local opposing tension that tends to keep the local membrane length @xmath21 constant in the course of time . in a vectorial form",
    "the tension is given by @xmath22 .",
    "consider two neighboring membrane points at positions @xmath20 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the resultant tension felt by the membrane element @xmath21 is given by @xmath24 ds + o(ds^2)$ ] .",
    "the force per unit length is obtained by dividing the above result by @xmath21 . using the geometrical result @xmath25 and taking the limit @xmath26",
    ", we obtain the tension force in eqn ( [ ftotal ] ) .",
    "since the boundary of the swimmer is a closed curve , it is convenient to decompose the active force into fourier series @xmath27 where we have defined the normalized arc length @xmath28 .",
    "we must impose that the total force and the total torque equal zero : @xmath29 the integrals are performed over the swimmer perimeter .",
    "this leads to three equations which are linear in terms of the active forces .",
    "the coefficients of the system depend on the actual shape , which is unknown _",
    "a priori_. conditions given by eqn ( [ forcetorque ] ) impose linear relations between the amplitudes @xmath30 .",
    "however , these relations did not allow us to easily reduce the number of independent force amplitudes because the resulting system was occasionally ill - conditioned .",
    "we solved this problem by adding an extra term to the active force , @xmath31 the first contribution is constant , and the second is purely tangential .",
    "we then use eqn ( [ forcetorque ] ) to express @xmath32 and @xmath33 in terms of @xmath34 .",
    "the virtue of this approach is the following : using the force and torque balance equations we easily see that in the linear system the coefficient in front of @xmath35 is proportional to the swimmer perimeter , whereas the coefficient in front of @xmath36 is proportional to the swimmer area , so that the matrix of the system of equations which multiplies the vector @xmath37 , is non - singular whatever the swimmer evolution , since the perimeter and area are definite positive quantities .",
    "our strategy is to keep the model as simple as possible , and therefore we will limit the expansion ( [ fourier ] ) to @xmath38 .",
    "the mode with @xmath39 does not play a role because the fluid is incompressible ( @xmath39 corresponds to a homogeneous pressure jump across the membrane ) . for simplicity we set @xmath40 .",
    "we are thus left with two complex amplitudes @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "once more for simplicity , the imaginary parts of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are set to zero , so the active force used in this work is taken to be @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 are time - dependent quantities expressing the cell s execution of a cyclic motion in order to move forwards . according to purcell s theorem @xcite , this cyclic motion should not be reversible in time owing to the invariance of the stokes equations upon time reversal . based on our first study on amoeboid motion",
    "@xcite we shall make a simple choice for time dependence @xmath46 where for simplicity @xmath47 and @xmath48 are taken to be equal ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we are thus left with four parameters characterizing the force distribution , @xmath1 , the scalar @xmath50 and the two components of @xmath33 .",
    "use of condition ( [ forcetorque ] ) allows one to express the three force components @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath50 as functions of @xmath1 for a given shape of the swimmer .",
    "we are thus left with a single parameter monitoring the force , namely , the amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "note that the total force and the total torque of our passive force related to @xmath53 ( eqn ( [ ftotal ] ) ) vanish automatically .",
    "indeed , the passive force can be written as a functional derivative of an energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the functional derivative .",
    "since this energy is intrinsic to the membrane , any rigid translation or rotation leaves it invariant .",
    "let @xmath56 be the displacement of a given point on the membrane during a time interval @xmath57 , corresponding to a rigid translation or rotation . in both cases",
    "the energy @xmath58 is unchanged and we have    @xmath59 d s = 0 .",
    "\\label{ft}\\ ] ]    for a translation , @xmath56 is constant and is denoted as @xmath60 , whereas for a rotation we have @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the angular velocity . applying condition ( [ ft ] ) to both cases one obtains    @xmath63 d s=0 & ( \\delta{\\mathbf r}=\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0\\times { \\mathbf r } ) . \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{force_torque}\\ ] ]    an explicit proof of the fact that the passive forces do not contribute to the total force is given in the appendix .      to quantify confined amoeboid dynamics",
    ", we define a set of dimensionless parameters .",
    "the set of physical parameters are the swimmer area @xmath7 and perimeter @xmath11 ( recall that the area defines a length scale @xmath6 ) , the channel width @xmath12 , the viscosity of the fluid ( taken to be the same outside and inside the swimmer ) @xmath3 , and two time scales @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 reflects the time needed for the swimmer to adapt to a static distribution of active forces of characteristic amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "the larger the active force , the faster the shape adapts .",
    "@xmath67 is the stroke period .",
    "all together , we obtain a set of three dimensionless parameters ( @xmath10 was already introduced above , but is regrouped here with other dimensionless numbers for the reader s convenience ) @xmath68 the first parameter defines confinement strength , the second measures the ratio between the stroke period and the adaption time .",
    "a large @xmath69 means that the stroke is so slow that the shape has ample time to adapt to the applied force , whereas a small @xmath69 means that the stroke is so fast that the shape does not have enough time to fully adapt to the applied force .",
    "finally , recall that the third parameter is the excess length ; large @xmath10 indicates a very deflated swimmer .",
    "we make use here of two methods : the boundary integral formulation  @xcite associated with the stokes flow , and the immersed boundary method  @xcite , which incorporates inertial effects , as well as arbitrary shape of the boundaries and their compliance , for future studies .",
    "we shall briefly recall below the two methods .",
    "the general discussion of the bim can be found in  @xcite and application to the present problem in @xcite . due to the linearity of the stokes equations we can convert the bulk equations into a boundary integral equation which relates the velocity on the membrane to the forces exerted on the membrane @xmath70 where the integral",
    "is performed over the membrane , with @xmath71 the membrane instantaneous position , @xmath72 is the instantaneous velocity of a membrane point , @xmath73 is the total force from the membrane ( eqn ( [ ftotal ] ) ) .",
    "the unknown lagrange multiplier @xmath53 entering the total force ( eqn ( [ ftotal ] ) ) is determined by requiring the divergence of velocity field along the membrane to be zero ( membrane incompressibility condition ) .",
    "@xmath74 is the green s function which vanishes at the bounding walls ( i.e. at @xmath75 ) @xcite . in an unbounded domain",
    "the green s function is nothing but the oseen tensor , which reads in 2d @xmath76 where @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ( einstein convention is adopted ) .",
    "however , this function does not vanish at the wall .",
    "therefore two alternatives are possible : ( i ) either use this function , and in which case we have to add to ( [ greenw ] ) an extra integral term ( the integrand contains the product of the green function and the hydrodynamic force on the boundaries ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite , or ( ii ) find a green function that vanishes at the walls .",
    "no explicit green s function vanishing at the walls is available , but it can be expressed in terms of a fourier integral  @xcite . the advantage of the latter alternative is the absence of integral terms on the walls ( the integral is performed on the swimmer membrane only ) , and therefore the system size along the wall ( @xmath79 direction ) can be taken as infinite , thus avoiding any potential numerical problem ( like dependence of the results on system size ) related to boundary condition along @xmath79 .",
    "some of the technical details of how the problem is numerically solved can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we present now the other method which can allow , in principle , to have arbitrary bounding geometry as well as deformable walls , a work which is planned in the future .",
    "therefore , it is essential to compare the two methods in this paper , before exploring the versatility of the immersed boundary method .",
    "the immersed boundary formulation is an eulerian - lagrangian framework in which fluid variables are defined in eulerian manner , while the membrane related variables are defined in lagrangian manner .",
    "the swimmer membrane as a moving inextensible interface , immersed in a @xmath80d fluid domain @xmath81 , is represented in a lagrangian parametric form as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 $ ] is a parameter of the initial configuration of the membrane .",
    "thus , the governing equations of the navier - stokes fluid system are    @xmath84    where @xmath85 represents the mass density , and the eulerian fluid and lagrangian immersed variables are linked by the @xmath80d dirac delta function @xmath86 .",
    "the total membrane force @xmath87 consists of the same active force as in bim and the tension force . for this numerical method",
    ", we adopt the spring - like elastic force to approximate the membrane inextensibility , that is , taking @xmath88 with a large stiffness constant @xmath89 . in other words",
    ", the spring relaxes to its equilibrium length on a very short time scale as compared to any physical time scale ( e.g. shape deformation time scale ) .",
    "details of numerical procedure can be found in references @xcite .",
    "we perform the time - stepping scheme as follows : the governing equations are discretized by the ibm .",
    "we consider the computational domain as a rectangle @xmath90\\times[c , d]$ ] ; the no - slip boundary condition for the velocity is imposed on the two walls @xmath91 and no - flux condition is applied on @xmath92 . within this domain , a uniform cartesian grid with mesh width @xmath93 in both @xmath94 and @xmath95 directions is employed .",
    "all simulations are performed by using an aspect ratio ( length of the channel divided by the width ) of a value 8 .",
    "comparison with bim method  with a literally infinite extent along @xmath79  shows good agreement .",
    "smaller values of the aspect ratios lead to deviations from bim where the swimming velocity is found to be higher , whereas the qualitative features remain unaffected .",
    "the fluid variables are defined on the standard staggered marker - and - cell ( mac ) manner  @xcite .",
    "that is , the velocity components @xmath96 and @xmath97 are defined at the cell - normal edges @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively , while the pressure @xmath100 is defined at the cell center @xmath101 . for the membrane interface , we use @xmath102 with @xmath103 to represent the lagrangian markers @xmath104 so that any spatial derivatives can be performed spectrally accurate by using fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical algorithm can be found in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "we first consider an amoeboid swimmer ( as ) initially located in the center of the channel , that is , its initial center of mass is @xmath105 .",
    "although this axial motion is generally found to be an unstable position ( see section [ various ] ) , it gives useful insights into the dynamics of the confined amoeboid swimmer .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a typical snapshot over @xmath106 deformation cycles .",
    "for quite a long period of time ( in our simulation this solution survives for a few hundred cycles ) , the swimmer moves along the channel ( @xmath79 direction ) .",
    "( color online ) snapshots of an axially moving swimmer over time ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "we will define the dimensionless instantaneous velocity as @xmath112 .",
    "its average over one swimming cycle is defined as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the center of mass of the swimmer , @xmath115 , undergoing a periodic oscillation in the axial direction as shown in ( a ) .",
    "a first observation is that for @xmath116 not too large ( from @xmath117 up to @xmath118 ) , the amplitude of the oscillation increases with confinement .",
    "the slope of the curves @xmath115 also increase with @xmath116 , indicating an enhancement of migration speed upon increased confinement .",
    "the increase of oscillation amplitude with @xmath116 ( for not too large @xmath116 ) is already an interesting indication that the swimmer takes advantage of the walls to enhance its migration speed .",

    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) shows that the instantaneous velocity changes during three deformation stroke periods .",
    "the negative velocity is induced by the confining walls ; in the unconfined case the velocity always remains positive  @xcite .      due to the linearity of the stokes equations",
    ", one may expect that the velocity of the swimmer scales linearly with the force .",
    "this has been adopted as a hypothesis in several studies where the swimmer is modeled as rigid body .",
    "typical examples are the medeling of _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite , _ bacillus subtilis",
    "_  @xcite ( examples of the so - called pushers ) , and _ chlamydomonas _ ( an example of puller )  @xcite . in the present study",
    "the relation between the velocity and the force is extracted a posteriori .",
    "we find that the velocity is a nonlinear function of the force amplitude .",
    "we have defined in equation ( [ dimension ] ) a set of three dimensionless parameters .",
    "our goal in this section being to discuss the effect of the force amplitude , we set @xmath10 and @xmath116 to constant values . the physical ( i.e. not the dimensionless ) average velocity over a swimming cycle is given , from dimensional analysis , by the relation @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a scaling function , unknown for the moment .",
    "let us first provide some bases for the behavior of @xmath126 using physical intuition .",
    "an obvious guess is that for a large @xmath69 , @xmath127 should be independent of the force amplitude .",
    "indeed , recall that @xmath69 can be written as @xmath128 .",
    "this is the ratio between the stroke period and the shape adaptation time .",
    "a large @xmath69 ( i.e. a large force ) implies that the swimmer attains its saturated shape ( in response to applied forces ) in a shorter time than the stroke time interval . in other words , further increasing the force amplitude will hardly change the sequence of shapes explored by the swimmer during one stroke cycle .",
    "this increase of @xmath1 does not promote faster swimming , only a faster adaptation time . indeed , in the stokes regime time does not matter - only the configuration is important .",
    "therefore , the speed should attain a plateau at large @xmath69 .",
    "our numerical simulation clearly shows this behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we can thus conclude that for large @xmath69 , @xmath129 .",
    "the velocity is thus solely determined by the stroke frequency .",
    "the situation is less obvious for small @xmath69 , the limit in which the force configuration changes in time faster than the shape adaptation .",
    "increasing @xmath69 ( but remaining in the small range limit ) means the shape has more time to adapt ( though not yet fully ) , resulting in a faster and faster motion since the shape , for each increase of @xmath69 , will be deformed more and more until saturation ( when the force is large enough ) .",
    "the first natural expectation would have been that we would see a linear relationship between velocity and force , but this naive expectation does not comply with the numerical finding .",
    "our results show a quadratic behavior . a qualitative argument in favor of this behavior is the following : if @xmath1 is small , it is legitimate to perform a perturbation theory in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "the swimmer deformation ( due to active force @xmath130 given by equation ( [ fact ] ) ) is proportional to leading order to @xmath131 , as is the swimmer velocity .",
    "averaging the velocity over a cycle gives zero , since @xmath130 is proportional to a superposition of @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "therefore the first non - vanishing contribution is quadratic in @xmath131 , leading to a quadratic dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "quadratic behavior was also recently reported for the three - bead swimmer @xcite . however , no saturation regime was shown in that paper .    in summary , the velocity of the swimmer behaves as @xmath134 figure [ fig8 ] shows the full nonlinear behavior obtained from the numerical solution which is in agreement with the above scalings .",
    "note that the velocity behaves for small force as @xmath135 , which is distinct from the classical stokes result where the velocity is @xmath136 .",
    "this behavior is amenable to experimental testability ( provided that the swimmer operates at a fixed given force when viscosity is varied ) .",
    "it is not however clear if the condition of @xmath137 is abundant or not in the amoeboid swimming world .",
    "it is thus of great importance to conceive of artificial amoeboid swimmers that could be monitored in order to scan the whole range of @xmath69 so as to permit tests of the above scaling relations .",
    "we have determined the velocity as a function of the deflation of the swimmer , a deflation characterized by the excess length @xmath10 .",
    "quasi - linear and nonlinear relations between the center of mass velocity magnitude @xmath122 and the excess length @xmath10 are found depending on confinement , as shown in fig .",
    "we expect that the more the swimmer is deflated the larger its velocity .",
    "indeed , the deformation amplitude of the swimmer increases with @xmath10 , which thus implies a higher speed . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , it is found that the exponent for weak confinement is almost @xmath138 ( shown by a cyan line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , and agrees with the study for a completely unbounded swimmer  @xcite",
    ". however , as confinement increases the picture is more complex : we have , at small @xmath10 , a power law with exponent lower than @xmath138 ( green line ) in the intermediate confinement regime , and an exponent higher than 1 in the case of strong confinement ( shown by a purple line in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",

    "@xcite we confirm that the nature ( pusher or puller ) of the swimmer is not an intrinsic property .",
    "several swimmers may have an instantaneous nature which changes over time .",
    "for example , _ chlamydomonas reinhardtii _",
    "@xcite is on the average ( average over one swimming cycle ) a puller , albeit it has two temporal phases where it behaves like a puller or a pusher .",
    "we also found here that the amoeboid swimmer can exhibit a pusher or a puller behavior at a given time ; however , the stresslet , averaged over one cycle , can change under the influence of external factors such as confinement , unlike other swimmers studied so far .",
    "for example , by changing the environment ( like confinement ) an amoeboid swimmer which is a pusher on the average , becomes a puller ( or vice versa ) when external parameters are changed .",
    "* the straight trajectory of the swimmer can become unstable in favor of navigation .",
    "navigation has been reported for other swimmers in two different studies @xcite . however , in the study using a three - bead model @xcite there is no conclusion about the final amplitude of navigation ( it increases monotonously with time ) , while in the study using a squirmer as a model @xcite navigation was found for a neutral swimmer only , and the navigation amplitude depended on initial conditions .",
    "here , in contrast , we found that navigation can occur for pushers ( a weak enough pusher ) as well as for neutral swimmers .",
    "for pushers we find that the amplitude is fixed , in that it does not depend on initial conditions . *",
    "the confinement was found to enhance the swimming speed in several previous studies @xcite . here",
    "also we reach the same conclusion , but with the specification that monotonous behavior ( even in the weak confinement regime ) is not a general tendency , so the reverse can also sometimes occur ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this points to the fact that this question should be more carefully considered . * in a previous study @xcite it was reported that a pusher crashes into the wall and a puller settles into a straight trajectory .",
    "here we have reported that this is not a general result : a pusher can also undergo navigation with a well - defined amplitude . *",
    "the swimming speed is found to be quadratic with the force amplitude and then tends towards a plateau at large enough amplitude .",
    "the quadratic behavior is shared with that of a three - bead swimmer @xcite , but no regime with a plateau was reported there .",
    "we believe that a modified three - bead model having a nonlinear spring with saturation ( like with the so - called fene model ) should capture the plateau behavior .",
    "although the present study provides a first route for the modeling of amoeboid swimming , several other questions deserve future consideration in order to capture a more realistic picture of swimming cells . in the present work",
    ", we assumed the membrane to be a simple phospholipid envelope whereas real cells are endowed with a cytoskeleton and a nucleus making the deformations more difficult . from equation ( [ scalinsmallf ] )",
    ", one can extract an order of magnitude of the active force of about @xmath204 pn ( using typical quantities @xcite for a @xmath205 m cell diameter , a migration velocity of @xmath205m / min , a water - like medium viscosity and a swimming cycle of characteristic time @xmath138 min ) .",
    "this force is smaller than the available force in a real cell .",
    "it will be of great importance to include the cell cytoskeleton in modeling for better comparison with experimental systems .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we have also considered a simple periodic function for the active forces .",
    "real observations of cell motion @xcite point to more complex shape dynamics .",
    "similar complex motions could be reproduced by assigning a complex time - dependent force distribution ( including higher harmonics )",
    ". it will be interesting in the future to use experimental data and , by solving an inverse problem , extract the active forces ( both in space and time ) to be used in our model for a more realistic analysis .",
    "another future issue is the study of the wall compliance effect @xcite . indeed , many eukaryotic cells _ in vivo _",
    "( e.g. cells of the immune system , cancerous cells ... ) move in soft tissues where cells are often in interstices , in between other cells and extracellular matrix .",
    "therefore , the confinement is not fixed in time but varies in response to stresses created by the cells . a basic representation of this effect",
    "could be had by considering bounding walls of a certain compliance .",
    "flexible walls can promote swimming in the strong confinement regime by allowing larger amplitude of deformation of the swimmer than rigid walls do .",
    "another important issue is to study the collective behaviors .",
    "for example , during wound healing and cancer spreading ( to name but a few examples ) cells move in a concerted fashion . it would be thus important to analyze if collective behaviors could emerge from the study of multiple swimmers , such as special patterns , synchronization , and so on . finally , _ in vivo",
    "_ cells move in complex visco - elastic materials , and it will be an important issue in the future to analyze as in a complex medium . an interesting issue will be to analyze the motion of a cell surrounded by other cells representing tissues .",

    "<S> the nature of the swimmer is also found to be affected by confinement : the swimmer can behave , on the average over one swimming cycle , as a pusher at low confinement , and becomes a puller at higher confinement , or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the swimmer s nature is thus not an intrinsic property . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the swimmer velocity @xmath0 with the force amplitude @xmath1 is analyzed in detail showing that at small enough @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the viscosity of the ambient fluid ) , whereas at large enough @xmath1 , @xmath0 is independent of the force and is determined solely by the stroke cycle frequency and swimmer size . </S>",
    "<S> this finding starkly contrasts with currently known results found from swimming models where motion is based on ciliary and flagellar activity , where @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , two definitions of efficiency as put forward in the literature are analyzed with distinct outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that one type of efficiency has an optimum as a function of confinement while the other does not . </S>",
    "<S> future perspectives are outlined . </S>"
