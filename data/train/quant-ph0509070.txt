    "quantum entanglement in the ground - state of strongly correlated systems @xcite has been intensively studied in recent years .",
    "its non - trivial behavior in these system at quantum phase transition point @xcite attracted many physicists interest .",
    "most of previous works focused on the spin models . and",
    "the concurrence , a measure of entanglement of two qubits @xcite , has been widely used in studying these systems .",
    "for example , osterloh _",
    "@xcite studied the concurrence between two spins located on a pair of nearest - neighbor sites in the transverse - field ising model @xcite .",
    "they found that this quantity shows singularity and obeys the scaling law in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition point of the system . on the other hand , for the xxz model",
    ", the concurrence is a continuous function of the anisotropic parameter and reaches its maximum at the critical point @xcite .",
    "however , the concurrence is very short - ranged .",
    "it vanishes quickly as the distance between two sites increases . for a substitution , verstraete _",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed the concept of localizable entanglement .",
    "they showed that it is long - ranged in quantum spin systems @xcite .",
    "alternatively , studies on the block - block entanglement between two parts of the system have established a connection between conformal field theory and the critical phenomena in the condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since real systems consist of itinerant electrons , some authors generalized this concept to the entanglement in lattice fermion systems @xcite .",
    "for example , for the extended hubbard model , we showed that its global phase diagram can be identified by the local entanglement @xcite .",
    "therefore , one is convinced that the entanglement of the ground state , like the conductivity in the mott - insulator transition and quantum hall effect , and magnetization in the external - field - induced phase transition , plays also a crucial role in quantum phase transitions .",
    "in classical optics , by recording interference pattern of two laser reflected from one object , its global information can be recovered from a piece of holograph due to the classical interference .",
    "similarly , the reduced density matrix of a quantum system contains not only information on its subset , but also the correlation between this subset and the rest part of the system .",
    "this fact allows us to study some global properties of the system by investigating a part of it , as we can see from the nontrivial behavior of block - block entanglement @xcite in the quantum spin models , as well as the local entanglement in extended hubbard model @xcite .",
    "however , for the block - block entanglement , the size of the reduced density matrix , which is required for calculation , grows exponentially as diameter of the block increases .",
    "obviously , it is impossible and , also , unnecessary to consider the case in which the size of block is comparable to macroscopic length . on the contrary , we would like to derive some properties of the system in a simple way .",
    "therefore , we shall consider the block which contains sufficient information to reveal some global information of the system . _ local entanglement , as a limiting case of block - block entanglement , plays such a role_.    the main purpose of this paper is to study the entanglement between a local part and the rest part of the system in the ground - state of quantum spin models for both spin @xmath2 and 1 . technically , to show the change of symmetry in the ground state of the system , we need to investigate the entanglement between a pair of neighboring spins and the rest part of the system .",
    "it is due to the fact that the ground states of these models are usually spin singlet state .",
    "our intention is to show that the global properties of the system can be also well understood from the behavior of local part due to the quantum coherence .",
    "although the local part consists only of two spins , we find that it is sufficient to describe the quantum phase transition in these systems .",
    "furthermore , we show that the change of symmetry in the ground state at the isotropic antiferromagnetic transition point yields a maximum value of local entanglement . on the other hand , at the ferromagnetic transition point ,",
    "the singular behavior of the local entanglement can be clarified from the point view of infinite degeneracy and level - crossing . in the two - dimensional case ,",
    "the cusp - like behavior of the local entanglement at the transition points implies the existence of long - range correlation in the thermodynamic system , which is absent in the one - dimensional case .",
    "first , we consider the spin-1/2 system .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian of the antiferromagnetic xxz model reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are spin-1/2 operators at site @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the anisotropy of the model .",
    "the sum is over all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "we impose the periodic boundary condition on the system .",
    "thus , the choice the neighboring spin pairs is independent of site index .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the hamiltonian commutes with the @xmath9-component of total spins @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the eigenstate of the hamiltonian is also the eigenstate of the @xmath9-component of total spin operator @xmath11 . as a result ,",
    "the reduced density matrix of the neighboring spins has the following form @xmath12 with respect to the standard basis @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the correlation functions .",
    "we have @xmath14    it is well known that , when @xmath15 , the global ground - state of the xxz model on the cubic lattice is nondegenerate and is a spin singlet @xcite .",
    "it implies that @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elementofmatrix ] ) .",
    "therefore , entanglement of the two spins and the rest part of the system can be characterized by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ( [ eq : reduceddensitymatrix ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "obviously , the local entanglement combines all three correlation functions @xmath19 ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "they behave differently as symmetry of the system changes . in the following ,",
    "we study how the local entanglement is affected by them .",
    "we start with the one - dimensional xxz model , which can be solved exactly by the quantum inverse scattering method@xcite .",
    "its bethe ansatz solution reads@xcite @xmath22 where the parameter @xmath23 arises from the anisotropic scale @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are spin rapidities , which describe the kinetic behavior of a state with @xmath27 down spins .",
    "the regime @xmath28 is characterized by real positive @xmath23 while the regime @xmath29 by pure imaginary @xmath23 with positive imaginary part . from the bethe ansatz equation , the energy spectra and the thermodynamics of the system can be obtained from the solution of @xmath27 spin rapidities@xcite . in particular",
    ", we find the ground - state energy as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the correlation functions can be calculated by the hellman - feynman theorem .",
    "it yields @xmath30     the local entanglement ( left ) of one - dimensional xxz model and its first derivative ( right ) as a function of the anisotropic term @xmath24.,width=264 ]     the concurrence ( solid line ) and the entanglement of formation ( dashed line ) between two nearest neighbors in one - dimensional xxz model as a function of the anisotropic term @xmath24.,width=264 ]    for one - dimensional spin-1/2 xxz model , two critical points separate the whole region of @xmath24 into three different phases .",
    "these are the ferromagnetic phase for @xmath31 , the metallic phase for @xmath32 and the antiferromagnetic insulating phase for @xmath33 . in the ferromagnetic region",
    ", the ground state is doubly degenerate and the local entanglement is zero .",
    "it means that there is no quantum correlation between two parts of the system .",
    "therefore , we shall concentrate on the region of @xmath15 . in the ising limit @xmath34 , the ground state is approximately a superposition of two nel states .",
    "therefore , the quantum fluctuation is zero , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , the longitudinal antiferromagnetic correlation @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the local entanglement tends to unit , i.e. @xmath37 , in this limit .",
    "it is due to the fact that , as @xmath24 decreases , the effect of hoping process become more and more important .",
    "thus the fluctuation term @xmath38 is undrawn from zero , while the ordering term is suppressed .",
    "therefore , the quantum correlation between the local part and the rest part of the system will be enhanced .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath39 , the hamiltonian can be transformed into a free spinless fermion model through the jordan - wigner transformation . in this case , the nearest - neighbor correlation functions of the system are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath42 . obviously , the fluctuation term is dominant , as we can see from the two eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix : @xmath43 and @xmath44 . by eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy ] ) , it produces a relatively smaller entropy . in this situation ,",
    "both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings are expected to weaken the dominant @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , when the antiferromagnetic coupling is turned on , the competition between ordering and fluctuation will lead to a maximum local entanglement at a certain point . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ figure_lev1d ] , it is just the critical point @xmath46 where the quantum phase transition undergoes . by the bethe - ansatz result@xcite ,",
    "the correlation functions at @xmath46 take on values @xmath47 .",
    "then , the local entanglement becomes @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the local entanglement is a continuous function around the transition point . as @xmath24 becomes negative , the antiferromagnetic order is obviously suppressed and the elements @xmath49 in @xmath50 tends to @xmath51 .",
    "this will also result in a larger value of @xmath52 .",
    "another interesting result is the singular behavior of @xmath52 at @xmath53 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_lev1d ] .",
    "it is due to the infinite - degeneracy at the critical point .",
    "thus , in one - dimensional xxz model , the quantum phase transitions can be well described by the local entanglement .",
    "however , these properties can not be identified by the ground - state energy , which is usually used in analyzing the quantum phase transitions .",
    "for instance , at @xmath46 , the ground - state energy is actually a continuous function and shows no sign of singularities @xcite .    clearly , the concept of the local entanglements is quite different from the one of the pairwise entanglement , usually measured by the concurrence@xcite .",
    "they describe the quantum correlation between different part of the system . however , they are closely to each other . to make this point more clear , we show both the concurrence and the local entanglement of the present model as a function of @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ figure_entoff ] . in the region of @xmath54 , as we explained above , the competition between ordering and fluctuation leads to a maximal value for both the local entanglement and the concurrence .",
    "as @xmath55 , however , the concurrence is dropped down to zero and the local entanglement is pulled up dramatically . this fact is consistent with the monogamy properties of the quantum entanglement@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the concurrence is only valid for the description of entanglement between two qubits .",
    "therefore , for fermionic models and spin models with spin larger than 1 , it is not a well defined measurement for pairwise entanglement , although the negativity@xcite may partially characterize it to a certain extent . in order to study the role of quantum correlation played in the quantum phase transition , the local entanglement , as the simplest and computable measurement of the block - block entanglement is a good replacement , as we showed for the extended hubbard model@xcite .",
    "next , we extend our study to two - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 xxz model .",
    "since there is no exact solution for higher dimensional xxz model , some approximate approaches such as the spin - wave theory@xcite or numerical calculations on finite lattice@xcite , have to be applied .",
    "in fact , with the help of scaling analysis , the results of the exact diagonalization are fully consistent with those obtained by the quantum monte carlo@xcite and other analytical method@xcite . by the exact diagonalization technique",
    ", we calculate the local entanglement of the two - dimensional model as a function of @xmath24 on both @xmath56 and @xmath57 square lattices with periodic boundary condition and show the results in fig .",
    "[ figure_len36 ] . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the local entanglement is a decreasing function of @xmath24 .",
    "it is due to the fact that enhancement of the antiferromagnetic order suppresses the quantum correlation between a local part and the rest part of the system . on the other hand , for @xmath59",
    ", it is an increasing function of @xmath24 , as we explained above for the one - dimensional case .",
    "furthermore , the local entanglement reaches its maximum at the isotropic point @xmath46 .",
    "however , unlike its one - dimensional counterpart , the local entanglement of the two - dimensional xxz model shows a cusp - like behavior around the critical point .",
    "such singular behavior implies the existence of long - range - order , which is absent in the one - dimensional case .",
    "it is consistent with our previous result for the two - dimensional xxz model@xcite .",

    "one of our main results on the one - dimensional xxz model is that the local entanglement is a smooth continuous function of @xmath24 around the critical point . in the meantime ,",
    "the correlation functions decays by power - law in the antiferromagnetic region .",
    "therefore , the local quantities of the system , such as energy density and the nearest - neighbor correlation functions , are not effected by the those spins , which are far away from the local pair . as a result , the finite degree of freedom in small system guarantees the analyticity of these quantities @xcite . in particular , the concurrence is continuous @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , the local entanglement should be also continuous .",
    "furthermore , in fig . [ figure_slent ] , we show the scaling behavior of the local entanglement for @xmath61 .",
    "we find that the local entanglement does not obey a length scaling law .",
    "it is rather different from behavior of other quantities , such as the spin stiffness in the xxz model @xcite .",
    "however , in two - dimensional xxz model , the maximum of local entanglement at the critical point is sharpened , as the size of the system increases ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_len36 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the existence of long - range correlation , which leads to a strong dependence of local entanglement on the system size . in other words , it is the infinitely large degree of freedoms in the infinite system which introduce the singular behavior of the local entanglement .",
    "these results are also consistent with the previous conclusions on the concurrence of the two - dimensional xxz model @xcite .",

    ", the ground - state of spin-1 chain contains fascinating surprise which originates from the haldane gap . for the isotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with integer spin",
    ", the existence of this gap in the excitation spectrum of the system was first conjectured by haldane @xcite .",
    "then , it was confirmed by the quantum monte carlo simulation@xcite and scaling analysis from the exact diagonalization@xcite .",
    "however , as @xmath24 increases , this gap will vanishes around @xmath67 .",
    "to study the role of the local entanglement in connection to the critical behavior of this system , we use the exact diagonalization method to compute the two - site entanglement in its ground state .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_leone ] .",
    "obviously , the behavior of the local entanglement is quite similar to the one of spin-1/2 model .",
    "in particular , the local entanglement has a maximum at the isotropic point , although it is not a quantum transition point .",
    "a careful scrutiny reveals that the transition occurring in spin-1 chain is of the kosterlitz - thouless type , which is quite different from the one for the heisenberg model of spin-@xmath0 . in the latter case ,",
    "the spin excitation spectrum of the system is gapless on both sides of the transition point .",
    "however , for the system with spin-@xmath1 , the spectrum becomes gapful on one side of the transition point .",
    "this situation is very similar to the one observed for the transverse field ising model@xcite .",
    "since the first derivative of the concurrence is singular and obeys scaling law around the transition point of this model@xcite , we speculate that the same behavior may be seen for the local entanglement around the transition point for the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg chain . indeed , by taking the first derivative of the local entanglement of hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_2 ] ) with respect to @xmath24 , we find a minimum point around @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ figure_dleone ] .",
    "moreover , its value varies as the size of the system increases . by fitting data with respect to the sample size",
    ", we see that it tends to @xmath69 in the thermodynamic limit .    to explore the effect of parameter @xmath66 , we set @xmath46 and rewrite hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_2 ] ) as @xmath70 by introducing trigonometric functions , we are also able to take the effect of coupling sign into our consideration .",
    "this hamiltonian has a rich phase diagram at zero temperature .",
    "it consists of the haldane phase , trimerized phase , and dimerized phase@xcite .",
    "we now study the role of local entanglement around critical points .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ biqu6_entang ] . from the figure",
    ", we find that the local entanglement reaches a local minimum at @xmath71 , which separates the haldane phase and trimerized phase . at @xmath72 ,",
    "the ground state is ferromagnetic and degenerate . in this case , the local entanglement can not be well defined because the thermal ground state comprises all states of lowest energy with equal weight . indeed , a fully polarized state is separable .",
    "therefore , if the ground state is spin polarized one , its entanglement is zero . as a result",
    ", sudden changes in the local entanglement occur at both @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "they are caused by the ground - state level - crossing .",
    "however , we do not find any discernible structure around the critical point @xmath75 , which separates the dimerized phase from the haldane phase .",
    "since we consider only the sample with @xmath76 sites , whose ground state has both of trimerized and dimerized orderings , the rapid increasing size imposes further limit on scaling analysis . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that an extremum will appear in its derivatives around @xmath75 when the system size becomes large , just like the case of @xmath69 in xxz model .",
    "we also find a local minimum at @xmath77 . around this point , @xmath78 and the hamiltonian",
    "is reduced to @xmath79 .",
    "its ground state is nondegenerate , while its first excited state is @xmath80-fold degenerate on one side of the transition point and @xmath81-fold on the other side , the degeneracy is exactly @xmath82-fold at the transition point .",
    "moreover , in the previous works @xcite , it has been shown that the dimerized phase in the region @xmath83 is gapless .",
    "therefore , a level - crossing between the lowest excited states must occur , as the one observed for the xxz model of spin-@xmath0 at the transition point @xmath46 .",
    "since the minimum in local entanglement is intrinsically related to the symmetry of the hamiltonian , we believe that the point @xmath77 is also a critical point at which two ordered phases are separated .",
    "in the present paper , we study the global phase diagram of the quantum spin models with either spin-@xmath0 or @xmath1 by investigating the local entanglement .",
    "we show that , indeed , many global properties of the system can be derived from such a local measurement . in fact , one has observed a long time ago that the original three - dimensional image can be recovered from a small piece of holograph , though its resolution is reduced .",
    "it is caused by the classical interference .",
    "similarly , our findings can be understood on the basis of the quantum superposition principle .",
    "we see that , for one - dimensional spin-1/2 xxz model , the local entanglement shows singular behavior around one critical point @xmath53 and takes on its maximum at another critical point @xmath46 . for the two - dimensional spin-1/2 xxz model , we find that the maximal point of local entanglement around @xmath46 is sharpened .",
    "it is due to the existence of long - range order , which is absent in one - dimensional case . for the spin-1 xxz system",
    ", the local entanglement also has maximum at the isotropic point .",
    "moreover , the scaling analysis manifests that its first derivative will tend to the critical point @xmath84 as the system size becomes infinite .",
    "the rich phase diagram for the bilinear - biquadratic model can be almost mapped out from the behavior of the local entanglement .",
    "furthermore , from the singular behavior the local entanglement , we find that the point @xmath77 may be also a transition point of this model .",
    "this issue deserves definitely further investigation ."
