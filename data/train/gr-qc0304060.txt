    "first generation large - scale laser interferometric gravitational - wave antennae @xcite are being placed into operation nowadays @xcite .",
    "the second generation of laser gravitational - wave antennae development is under way concurrently @xcite .",
    "sensitivity of these second generation antennae will be close to the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite that is characteristic sensitivity level where the measurement noise ( _ i.e. _ the shot noise in the laser interferometric devices ) and the back - action noise ( _ i.e. _ the radiation pressure noise ) contribute equal parts to the measurement error :    @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the double - sided spectral density of the equivalent noise for the dimensionless amplitude of the metrics perturbation @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the mean frequency of the gravitational - wave signal , @xmath4 is the mass of the interferometer mirrors , and @xmath5 is the length of the interferometer arms .",
    "further improvement of the sensitivity will require to use the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement methods @xcite which allow to eliminate the part produced by the back - action noise from the meter output .",
    "several possible design of qnd laser gravitational - wave antennae have been proposed already .",
    "they can be divided into three main groups .",
    "the first group is based on the fact that the value of the sql depends on the nature of the test object .",
    "in particular , a harmonic oscillator provides better sensitivity in the narrow band close to its resonance frequency than a free mass does , even if the same sql - limited meter is used in both cases @xcite .",
    "it was shown in articles @xcite that in the signal - recycling configuration of the interferometric gravitational - wave antennae an optical rigidity can be created rather easily that will turn test masses into mechanical oscillators .",
    "moreover , this optical rigidity has specific spectral dependence which allows to obtain sensitivity better than the sql for both free mass and ordinary harmonic oscillator . using this method it is possible to obtain sensitivity a few times better than the sql for a free mass in a relatively wide band @xcite or `` dive '' deep below the sql in a narrow band @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to note that both regimes require about the same optical pumping energy as standard sql - limited schemes .",
    "it is the author s opinion that these relatively simple methods could ( and should ) be implemented already in the second generation of laser gravitational - wave antennae .",
    "the second group of methods requires more substantial modifications of the laser gravitational - wave antenna topology which convert it into a qnd device .",
    "examples of this approach are : interferometer with modified input and/or output optics , which implements the spectral variational measurement @xcite and different implementations of the _ quantum speedmeter _ scheme @xcite . in principle , they allow to obtain arbitrarily high sensitivity . in practice , however , they `` suffer '' from very high optical power circulating in the interferometer arms , which also depends sharply on the required sensitivity",
    ".    it can be shown ( see @xcite ) that the optical energy has not to be smaller than the value of    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the ratio of the signal amplitude which can be detected to the amplitude corresponding to the standard quantum limit ( the smaller is @xmath7 the better is the sensitivity ) , and @xmath8 is the squeezing factor ( @xmath9 for the optical field coherent quantum state and @xmath10 for the squeezed state ) ,    @xmath11    is the optimal energy for the sql - limited interferometric antenna , @xmath12 is the pumping frequency , and @xmath5 is the length of the interferometer arms . , [ e_eql ] , [ e_sql ] ) correspond to the case of the standard michelson  fabry - perot topology with four mirrors having equal masses @xmath4 , which was analyzed in detail in article @xcite .",
    "note also the factor @xmath13 in formula ( [ e_eql ] ) , which arises for the back - action noise that makes up half of the net noise in the sql - limited detectors , is eliminated from the output signal of the qnd detectors .",
    "it allows to obtain sensitivity equal to the sql ( @xmath14 ) using two times smaller energy or , put it otherwise , to obtain sensitivity @xmath15 times better than the sql ( @xmath16 ) using @xmath17 . ]",
    "formula ( [ e_sql ] ) is valid in the wide - band regime where the bandwidth @xmath18 . in the narrow - band regime",
    "the energy can be reduced by the factor of @xmath19 .    if , for example , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( these values correspond to the proposed gravitation - wave antenna ligo - ii @xcite ) then @xmath24 .",
    "corresponding circulating optical pumping power is equal to    @xmath25    it is possible to conclude that the feasibility of these second group methods depends crucially on the experimental progress in preparation of highly squeezed quantum states ( with @xmath26 ) .",
    "the third and the most radical approach , _ intracavity readout scheme _ , was proposed in the article @xcite .",
    "it was proposed to measure directly the redistribution of the optical energy _ inside _ the antenna in a qnd way ( without absorption of the optical quanta ) instead of monitoring output light beam _ outside _ the antenna using photodetectors . in this case",
    "the necessary non - classical quantum state of the optical field [ factor @xmath8 in the formula ( [ e_eql ] ) ] is generated automatically and therefore the pumping energy does not depend directly on the required sensitivity .        in the article @xcite a possible implementation of the gravitational - wave antenna with intracavity detection ,",
    "so - called `` optical bars '' scheme , was proposed ( see fig.[fig : optbar ] ) . in this",
    "scheme end mirrors a , b , and an additional local mirror c form two fabry - perot cavities coupled by means of the mirror c amplitude transmittance @xmath27 . relatively weak",
    "external pumping ( not shown in the picture ) is necessary in order to compensate internal losses in the optical elements and to support steady value of the optical energy in the cavities .",
    "the optical field acts here as a two rigid springs with one located between the mirrors a and c , while the second one ( l - shaped ) located between the mirrors b and c. the rigidity of these springs is equal to    @xmath28    where    @xmath29    is the sloshing frequency of the system of two coupled cavities ac and bc [ strictly speaking , @xmath30 is equal to the asymptotic value of the rigidity at @xmath31 ; see formula ( [ cal_k ] ) ] .",
    "due to these springs displacement of the end mirrors a and b caused by the gravitational wave produces displacement of the local mirror c , which can be detected , for example , by a small - scale optical interferometric meter which monitors position of the mirror c relative to reference mass placed outside the optical pumping field .",
    "it was shown in the article @xcite that if optical energy exceeds some threshold value of @xmath32 then these springs are rigid enough to provide the signal displacement of the local mirror c equal to the displacement of the end mirrors . in this case",
    "the sensitivity does not depend on the optical energy and is defined by the sensitivity of the local meter only ( compare with formula ( [ e_eql ] ) which contains the factor @xmath33 ) .",
    "however , it was concluded in the article @xcite that the threshold energy have to be rather large and close to @xmath34 .        in the article",
    "@xcite an improved version of the `` optical bars '' scheme was considered .",
    "it differs from the original `` optical bar '' scheme by two additional mirrors a and b ( see fig.[fig : optlever ] ) which turn the antenna arms into two fabry - perot cavities aa and bb similar to the standard fabry - perot  michelson topology of the contemporary gravitational - wave antennae .",
    "this scheme was called the `` optical lever '' because it can provide significant gain in the signal displacement of the local mirror similar to the gain which can be obtained using ordinary mechanical lever with unequal arms .",
    "the value of this gain is equal to    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the finesse of the fabry - perot cavities aa and bb. it was shown in the article @xcite that in all other aspects the `` optical lever '' scheme is identical to the `` optical bars '' one but in the former one the local mirror @xmath37 transmittance @xmath27 have to be @xmath38 times larger , and its mass have to be @xmath39 times smaller . due to this scaling of mass the gain in the signal displacement by itself",
    "does not allow to overcome the sql as the sql value increases exactly in the same proportion .",
    "but it allows to use less sensitive local position meter and increases the signal - to - noise ratio for miscellaneous noises of non - quantum origin .",
    "no means of reducing the optical power below the level of @xmath40 were discussed in the article @xcite .    at the same time",
    "different regimes of the `` optical bars '' scheme were considered in brief in the article @xcite , and it was mentioned that if a local meter with cross - correlated measurement noise and back - action noise is used then the threshold energy can be substantially lower than the @xmath40 ( see subsection 4.2 of that article ) .",
    "it is evident that this conclusion is also valid for the `` optical lever '' scheme .    in the current article",
    "this cross - correlation regime is analyzed in detail . in the section [ sec : mechmodel ]",
    "the simple mechanical model is considered , which shows how the cross - correlation of the meter noises allows to reduce the pumping energy . in the section",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] sensitivity limits are considered and numerical estimates are provided .",
    "most of the calculations are done for the more simple `` optical bars '' scheme ; applicability for the `` optical lever '' version is considered in the subsection [ sec : optlever ] .",
    "[ cb]@xmath41        consider the mechanical model shown in fig.[fig : mechmodel ] . here",
    "masses @xmath4 correspond to the end mirrors of the gravitational - wave antenna ( compare with fig.[fig : optbar ] ) , mass @xmath42 corresponds to the local mirror , and springs @xmath43 correspond to the optical rigidity .",
    "equal signal forces    @xmath44    acts on both end masses @xmath4 , and the goal is to detect the signal by monitoring the local mass @xmath42 state .",
    "suppose that conditions for the `` intermediate case '' of the article @xcite are fulfilled , namely , the local mass @xmath42 is small ,    @xmath45    where @xmath3 is the signal frequency and the rigidity @xmath30 is also relatively small :    @xmath46    due to condition ( [ small_m ] ) the signal displacement of the local mass will be equal to the signal displacement of the end ones .",
    "however , due to condition ( [ smallk ] ) the standard quantum limit for the position of the local test mass @xmath47 will be much larger than the standard quantum limit for the positions of the heavy end masses    @xmath48    really , let @xmath49 be the measurement precision provided by the local meter .",
    "due to the uncertainty relation perturbation of the mass @xmath42 momentum in this case will be equal to    @xmath50    it corresponds to the random force with the uncertainty equal to    @xmath51    which produces the additional random displacement of the local test mass    @xmath52    therefore , the sum error will be equal to    @xmath53    minimum of this expression is equal to    @xmath54    and this value is @xmath55 times larger than the standard quantum limit ( [ sql_x ] ) . due to this consideration",
    "it was concluded in the article @xcite that in order to obtain sensitivity close to the @xmath56 it is necessary to use strong rigidity :    @xmath57    and therefore , large pumping energy .",
    "consider , however , the situation more precisely .",
    "if condition ( [ small_m ] ) is fulfilled then equations of motion ( in the spectral representation ) of the system shown in fig.[fig : mechmodel ] looks like :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the back - action force of the local meter .",
    "it follows from these equations that the output signal of the meter is equal to :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the measurement noise which determines the measurement error @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to see that if the measurement noise contains the part proportional to the back - action force :    @xmath63    then the main back - action term @xmath64 in the equation ( [ tilde_y_1 ] ) vanishes :    @xmath65    of course strong perturbation @xmath64 still exists in this case but the meter does not `` see '' it as it is masked by the correlated with @xmath66 part of @xmath67 .",
    "equation ( [ correl_out_1 ] ) corresponds exactly to the output signal of the position meter with the measurement noise @xmath68 attached directly to a test mass @xmath69 . in particular , if an ordinary interferometric position meter with constant pumping power and time- and frequency - independent phase is used , then sensitivity of such a scheme will be limited by the sql ( [ sql_x ] ) even if the rigidities are much smaller than @xmath70 , as long as condition ( [ small_m ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "we will consider here only two main factors which limit the sensitivity of the scheme being considered : optical losses and noises of the local meter putting aside numerous sensitivity limits which are common for all topologies of the laser gravitational - wave antennae ( in particular , miscellaneous internal noises in the mirrors and mirror suspensions ) . in this case output signal of this scheme normalized as an equivalent gravitational - wave signal",
    "can be presented as    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the actual gravitational - wave signal , @xmath73 is the noise which arises due to the optical losses , and @xmath74 is the one created by the local meter fluctuations .",
    "these noises are calculated in appendix [ app : noises ] .",
    "taking into account formulae ( [ h_loss ] ) , ( [ s_loss_raw ] ) , and approximations which have been made in the appendix [ app : noises ] , spectral density of the noise @xmath73 can be presented as    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the fabry - perot cavities damping rate .",
    "ratio of this spectral density to the spectral density ( [ sql ] ) which corresponds to the sql is equal to ) looks a bit misleading because it seems that the smaller is @xmath3 the worse is sensitivity . it is easy to see that it is not the case because @xmath34 also depends on @xmath3 and the worst case takes place at the highest signal frequency .",
    "therefore , it is for this frequency all estimates should be done . ]",
    "@xmath77    this formula resembles formula ( [ e_sql ] ) because in both these formulae the larger is ratio @xmath78 the better is the sensitivity . at the same time formula ( [ xi2_loss ] )",
    "contains the factor @xmath79 which in principle can be made very small .",
    "in particular , modern achievements in fabrication of high - quality mirrors permits to obtain @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , even , say , for @xmath81 sensitivity of about one order of magnitude better than the sql , @xmath82 could be achieved .",
    ": 1  asymptotic curve for @xmath83 ; 2  the optimal energy ; 3  the energy is too small . ]",
    "suppose that a sql - limited position meter with frequency - independent measurement noise @xmath67 and back - action noise @xmath66 are used as the local meter .",
    "for example , a small - scale optical interferometer with the length @xmath84 can be used as such a meter .",
    "suppose also that these noises are cross - correlated [ compare with formula ( [ correl_simple ] ) ] :    @xmath85    this simple frequency - independent cross - correlation can be created rather easily by using a homodine detector with the fixed local oscillator phase . and",
    "@xmath66 can also be made cross - correlated by this method .",
    "it can be shown , however , that this additional cross - correlation does not provide any significant advantages so we do not consider this possibility here . ]",
    "spectral densities of the measurement noise @xmath86 and the back - action noise @xmath87 satisfy the uncertainty relation    @xmath88    and their ratio depends on the optical pumping energy @xmath89 in the meter :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the quality factor of the local meter cavity .",
    "the spectral density @xmath92 of the noise @xmath74 for this meter has rather sophisticated spectral dependence [ see formulae ( [ s_meter ] ) , ( [ spectra ] ) ] which allows in principle to obtain sensitivity better than the sql in some narrow band . in this paper , however , wide - band optimization only will be considered .    it is easy to see that if the pumping energy @xmath93 is very large ( @xmath94 ) then the local meter output is close to the output of the meter attached directly to the test mass @xmath95 with the signal force @xmath96 acting on this mass .",
    "spectral density of the local meter noise @xmath74 in this case is equal to    @xmath97    \\ge \\frac{2m+m}{m}\\,\\frac{\\hbar}{m\\omega^2l^2 } \\,.\\ ] ]    ( see curve 1 in fig.[s_total ] ) .",
    "the rightmost part of this formula corresponds to the sql for the considered scheme which , as well as the sql ( [ sql ] ) , is reached at some specific frequency @xmath98 only . in the case",
    "considered here this frequency is equal to    @xmath99{\\frac{1}{(2m+m)^2}\\,\\frac{s_f}{s_x } }    = \\sqrt{\\frac{8q{\\cal e}_{\\rm local}}{(2m+m)l^2 } } \\,.\\ ] ]    it should be noted that if @xmath100 then the sql ( [ s_meter_sql ] ) corresponds to @xmath15 times better sensitivity than the sql for traditional schemes ( [ sql ] ) .",
    "this gain is obtained because two mirrors @xmath4 are required for this scheme instead of four ones as in traditional schemes .    at the same time",
    "if @xmath93 is too small then spectral density ( [ spectra_a ] ) of back - action noise increases sharply at high frequencies ; however , some narrow - band gain in sensitivity can be obtained in this regime ( see curve 3 in fig.[s_total ] ) .",
    "reasonable intermediate value of @xmath93 can be chosen using , for example , the following algorithm : ( i ) require that @xmath92 does not exceeds @xmath101 all over the spectral range of interest , up to some given frequency @xmath102 ( see curve 2 ) ; ( ii ) with respect to this requirement set @xmath93 as small as possible ; in any case it have to be much smaller than @xmath40 . in addition condition ( [ stability ] ) which is necessary for the system dynamic stability ( see appendix d of the article @xcite ) is also should be taken into account .",
    "it is easy to show that these requirement can be satisfied only if the sloshing frequency is large ,    @xmath103    and in this case the optimal values are equal to    @xmath104    suppose , for example , that @xmath105 , @xmath21 , and therefore @xmath106 . in this case if @xmath107 , then @xmath108 and @xmath109 .    in principle , more transparent mirror c can be used , which allows further decrease of @xmath93 .",
    "however , @xmath93 depends on @xmath110 as @xmath111 only , while @xmath112 depends as @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the smaller values of @xmath93 correspond to very small ( sub - gram ) values of the mass @xmath42 .",
    "it is unclear , if such a small mirror could tolerate tens of the kilowatts of the optical power reflecting from it and hundreds of watts passing through it .",
    "the small - scale optical interferometer discussed in the previous subsection can be converted into a qnd meter by using , for example , so - called stroboscopic - variation measurement ( svm ) technique ( see articles @xcite ) .",
    "this method permits to filter out the back - action noise by using periodic modulation of the local oscillator phase and/or the pumping energy @xmath89 with frequency which has to be higher than the upper frequency of the gravitational - wave signal . for small - scale interferometers this modulation",
    "can be implemented rather easily .",
    "the residual noise spectral density will be proportional to the spectral density @xmath86 of the meter measurement noise @xmath114 and in principle can be made arbitrarily small [ see formulae ( [ spectra_b ] , [ qnd_meter ] ) ] by reducing @xmath86 ( _ i.e. _ by increasing the local meter sensitivity ) .",
    "however , for technological reasons it is useful to provide the value of the local mirror signal displacement @xmath115 as large as possible [ see formula ( [ y_grav ] ) ] .",
    "an optimization algorithm similar to one considered in the previous section can be used here .",
    "start with the simple quasi - static ( low - frequency ) case , when @xmath116 . in this case",
    "the signal displacement is equal to    @xmath117    and corresponding measurement noise is equal to    @xmath118    require now that @xmath119 does not exceeds @xmath120 for all frequencies within the range @xmath121 .",
    "it is shown in the appendix [ qnd_opt ] that in this case the pumping energy has to satisfy the following inequality :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is a numerical factor which varies from @xmath124 when @xmath125 to @xmath13 when @xmath126 [ see formula ( [ opt_k ] ) ] .",
    "this inequality together with the stability condition ( [ stability ] ) can be rewritten as the following condition for the mass @xmath112 :    @xmath127    values of @xmath112 and @xmath110 in formula ( [ e_qnd ] ) can vary in wide range and should be chosen considering technological reasons . in principle , heavy local mirror c with low transmittance @xmath27 ( _ i.e _ low sloshing frequency ) as well as relatively small one with high transmittance @xmath27 ( _ i.e _ high sloshing frequency ) can be used .",
    "suppose that @xmath128 .",
    "this value looks like the reasonable one due to limitation caused by the internal losses , see subsection ( [ opt_losses ] ) .",
    "suppose also that @xmath20 and @xmath129 .",
    "in this case typical numerical examples are the following .",
    "heavy local mirror :    @xmath130    small local mirror :    @xmath131    of course all intermediate values between these two examples are also possible .      in principle , the same idea of the local meter with cross - correlated noise can be used in order to reduce optical pumping energy in the `` optical lever '' scheme too . however , due to technological limitations in the case of sql - limited local meter only modest advantages can be obtained .",
    "really , the sloshing frequency in the `` optical lever '' scheme is equal to    @xmath132    ( it is supposed that @xmath133 ) . at the same time it follows from the formula ( [ e_sqlmeter ] ) that the sloshing frequency have to be equal to    @xmath134    ( it is supposed that @xmath135 ) . due to these limitations",
    "it is impossible to obtain significant gain @xmath38 in the signal displacement using the pumping energy @xmath136 .    on the other hand , in the case of a",
    "qnd local meter low sloshing frequency @xmath137 can be used [ see formulae ( [ heavyc ] ) ] which makes it possible obtain the gain up to    @xmath138    the local mirror mass in the case of the `` optical lever '' scheme have to be @xmath39 time smaller than the figures of formula ( [ heavyc ] ) .",
    "it follows from the estimates ( [ heavyc ] ) that it has to be equal to about @xmath139 .",
    "this value does not seems unrealistic one as the optical power falling on it will be reduced by the factor of @xmath38 and for the case of @xmath140 will be equal to about few hundred watts .",
    "in the authors opinion , regime of the optical bars / optical lever intracavity topologies considered in this paper looks rather promising for implementing in the third generation of gravitational - wave antennae .",
    "it allows to obtain sensitivity better than the sql and it can do it using rather moderate value of the optical pumping energy : just tens of kilowatts of circulating power , instead of megawatts or tens of megawatts .    at the same time , before the implementation of this method , several issues of a technological origin have to be solved .",
    "some of them are common for all proposed topologies of the laser gravitational - wave antennae : the problem of an internal noises of different origin in the test masses ( see , for example , papers @xcite ) is the most notable one , and some are specific for the intracavity topologies .",
    "it seems that the most important of them is the design of the local meter , and it is evident that this device has to be explored intensively , both experimentally and theoretically before the decisions about the design of the third generation laser gravitational - wave antennae will be made .",
