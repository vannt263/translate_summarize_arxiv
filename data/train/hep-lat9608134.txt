    "lattice qcd determination of the kaon @xmath0 parameter with the quenched kogut - susskind quark action has been pursued over a number of years .",
    "last year we initiated a renewed effort toward this goal using vpp500/80 at kek , improving upon a number of points of calculation of the previous pioneering studies@xcite .",
    "in particular , with a systematic scaling study over a wide range of lattice spacing carried out with improved statistics , we attempted to achieve a verification of the @xmath7 scaling violation theoretically suggested@xcite and then a precision determination of the continuum value of @xmath4 .",
    "our initial results taken at @xmath9 gev ( @xmath5 ) , reported at lattice 95@xcite , however , did not exhibit the expected @xmath7 behavior but were apparently more consistent with an @xmath10 behavior . in order to understand this result ,",
    "we have since extended our study by a new calculation both at a larger and a smaller value of @xmath11 .",
    "we have also carefully examined the question of finite - size effects in @xmath4 , which could jeopardize the correct scaling behavior .",
    "in addition a reexamination of the theoretical argument for the @xmath7 behavior has been made .",
    "here we present results of these analyses .    in this article",
    "we mostly concentrate on data taken with an equal mass for @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks . toward the end",
    "we briefly touch upon the question of quenched chiral logarithms that could affect the case of unequal quark masses .",

    "we estimate errors by a single elimination jackknife procedure .",
    "in fig .  [ bkmro ]",
    "we present @xmath4(ndr , 2 gev ) from our main sequence of runs as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the left and rightmost points are the new data taken at @xmath32 on a @xmath45 lattice and at @xmath2 on a @xmath46 lattice .    as we observed at the time of lattice 95 , the middle four points are consistent with a linear @xmath3 dependence .",
    "viewed more closely , the fourth point on the right lies below , while the other three are on a straight line .",
    "this suggests a convex shape of the curve of @xmath4 toward larger lattice spacings , which is confirmed by the new data at @xmath2 ( the rightmost point in fig .",
    "[ bkmro ] ) .    on the other hand , the new data at @xmath32 at the leftmost lies higher than the straight line , which is suggestive of an onset of an @xmath7 behavior for smaller lattice spacings .",
    "the solid line shows a fit of form @xmath47 to the four points , excluding the two points on the right at @xmath48 and 5.7 .",
    "we note , however , that the data by themselves still do not allow a distinction between an @xmath10 and @xmath7 dependence ; five points for @xmath49 can also be fitted with the form @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "let us also note that the discrepancy of values between gauge invariant and non - invariant operators , even in the continuum limit , represents a systematic uncertainty of @xmath51 arising from the renormalization factors which are correctly incorporated only to the order of one loop .",
    "we should emphasize that a distinction between an @xmath10 or @xmath7 dependence rests on a very tiny effect in the range of lattice spacing being examined ; a 2% decrease of the point at @xmath32 would render the @xmath10 behavior strongly favored .",
    "clearly a reexamination of finite - size effects is needed , especially since our physical spatial size decreases by about 10% from @xmath52fm to 2.3fm between @xmath33 and 6.4 .    in fig .",
    "[ bkla ] we summarize results of our finite - size study at @xmath33 and 6.4 , plotting @xmath4(ndr , 2gev ) as a function of physical spatial size @xmath25 . for @xmath53fm , we do not observe a size - dependent shift of @xmath4 beyond the statistical error of at most 1% .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the data in fig .",
    "[ bkmro ] , taken with @xmath25=2.3 - 2.9 fm , are not affected by finite size effects .",
    "in particular , the rise of @xmath4 at @xmath32 is not a finite size effect .    an unexpected feature in fig .",
    "[ bkla ] is that finite - size effects below @xmath54fm is markedly enhanced at a weaker coupling of @xmath32 than at 6.0 .",
    "origin of this behavior is not clear to us .",
    "a subtle point in the theoretical analysis of @xmath3 dependence of @xmath4 is that numerical simulations employ 4-component hypercubic fields @xmath55 defined on a coarse lattice of lattice spacing @xmath56 , in terms of which the kogut - susskind quark action has an apparent @xmath10 term : @xmath57 q(y ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , a redefinition of fields given by @xmath58 with @xmath59 removes the @xmath10 terms at tree - level so that the action becomes @xmath60 q(y)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + o(a^2 ) .",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore @xmath4 evaluated with @xmath62 s with @xmath63 has no @xmath10 corrections at tree level .",
    "the rest of the argument essentially follow that of ref .  @xcite . in the presence of interactions the action expressed in terms of @xmath64 fields may contain @xmath10 terms .",
    "however , using symmetry of the original action under translation , @xmath65 , rotation , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 symmetry , @xmath68 performed simultaneously with a mass rotation , @xmath69 , one can show that there are no dimension five operators giving rise to an @xmath10 term .",
    "therefore , the original action is itself improved up to @xmath7 .",
    "one can also check that the @xmath4 operator is similarly improved to @xmath7 since there are no dimension seven operators with the same symmetry properties as the original one .",
    "our theoretical reexamination supports the original assertion@xcite that there should be no @xmath10 corrections in @xmath4 including gauge interactions .",
    "this leads us to attempt a continuum extrapolation of our data assuming the @xmath7 dependence .",
    "fitting data in fig .",
    "[ bkmro ] to the purely quadratic form @xmath47 , excluding the two points on the right at @xmath48 and 5.7 , we find @xmath70 where the first error is statistical and the second is the systematic error of @xmath51 estimated from the difference of extrapolated values for gauge non - invariant and invariant operators .",
    "changing the number of points and/or including higher order terms in @xmath44 , we find that the extrapolated values stay consistent with the above value .",
    "we measure @xmath4 also for unequal quark masses for @xmath12 and @xmath13 quark in our simulation . in this case",
    ", a potential problem of quenched chiral logarithm may arise in the extrapolation to the chiral limit in @xmath71 .",
    "we examine this problem through fits of our data for @xmath72 to the form predicted by quenched chiral perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "generally we find very good fits .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath73 multiplying the quenched chiral logarithms turns out negative albeit with a large error , @xmath74 ( we note that the sign of the @xmath75 term in ref .  @xcite is incorrect@xcite ) .",
    "also fits excluding the logarithm are quite acceptable , only slightly worse than those with it .",
    "thus we can not conclusively conclude the presence of quenched chiral logarithms .",
    "let us add the remark that the mass inside the quenched chiral logarithm should theoretically be that of the non - nambu - goldstone pion@xcite",
    ". fits in this case differ from those with the nambu - goldstone pion mass only very close to @xmath76 , however , so that the conclusion above does not change .",
    "our new data for @xmath4 extending the results of last year to smaller and larger lattice spacings suggest that the curve of @xmath4 changes curvature from convex to concave as the lattice spacing is reduced from @xmath77 to 0.2 .",
    "this behavior explains an apparently linear dependence we observed in our previous data , and is also consistent with an @xmath7 dependence theoretically expected toward the continuum limit . to confirm",
    "if @xmath4 stays on an @xmath7 curve , we plan to carry out one more run on a @xmath78 lattice at @xmath1=6.65 with yet smaller lattice spacing of @xmath79 .    9 g. kilcup",
