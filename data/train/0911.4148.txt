    "over the last quarter of a century , _ expander _ graphs have played a vital role in a remarkable variety of areas , ranging from combinatorics to discrete geometry to theoretical computer science , while exhibiting deep connections to algebra and number theory .",
    "notable applications of expanders , to name just a few , include the design of efficient communication networks , explicit error - correcting codes with efficient encoding and decoding schemes , derandomization of randomized algorithms , compressed sensing and the study of metric embeddings . see the expository article of sarnak  @xcite on these intriguing objects , as well as the comprehensive survey of hoory , linial and wigderson  @xcite demonstrating their many applications .",
    "informally , an expander is a graph where every small subset of the vertices has a relatively large edge boundary ( see section  [ sec : intro - exp ] for a formal definition ) .",
    "most applications utilize @xmath12-regular sparse expanders ( @xmath20 fixed ) , where it is well - known that expansion is related to the ratio between @xmath12 and @xmath17 , the second largest eigenvalue in absolute value of the adjacency matrix .",
    "the smaller @xmath17 is , the better the graph expansion becomes . as a consequence of the alon - boppana bound  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath21 where the @xmath22-term tends to @xmath23 as the graph size tends to @xmath24 .",
    "graphs for which @xmath25 are in that respect optimal expanders and are called _ ramanujan _ graphs .    a proof that @xmath12-regular expanders exist for any @xmath26",
    "was given by pinsker  @xcite in the early 70 s via a simple probabilistic argument .",
    "however , constructing good expanders _",
    "explicitly _ is far more challenging and particularly important in applications ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , a task that was first achieved by margulis  @xcite .",
    "thereafter ramanujan graphs were constructed explicitly in the seminal works of lubotzky - phillips - sarnak  @xcite and margulis  @xcite , relying on deep number theoretic facts . till this date",
    "ramanujan graphs remain mysterious : not only are there very few constructions for such graphs , but for instance it is not even known whether they exist for any @xmath26 .",
    "a striking result of friedman  @xcite shows that almost every @xmath12-regular graph on @xmath0 vertices is _ nearly _ ramanujan  it has @xmath27 ( the @xmath22-term tends to @xmath23 as @xmath28 ) .",
    "what proportion of these graphs satisfy @xmath25 remains an intriguing open problem .    the useful connection between expanders and the topological notion of _ covering maps _ was extensively studied by many authors over the last decade .",
    "various properties of random covers of a given graph were thoroughly examined ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , motivated in part by the problem of generating good ( large ) expanders from a given one .    given two simple graphs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a _ covering map _ @xmath29 is a homomorphism that for every @xmath30 induces a bijection between the edges incident to @xmath31 and those incident to @xmath32 . in the presence of such a covering map",
    "we say that @xmath2 is a _ lift _",
    "( or a cover ) of @xmath1 , or alternatively that @xmath1 is a _ quotient _ of @xmath2 .",
    "the _ fiber _ of @xmath33 is the set @xmath34 , and if @xmath1 is connected then all fibers are of the same cardinality , the _ covering number_.    one well - known connection between covers and expansion is the fact that the universal cover of any @xmath12-regular graph is the infinite @xmath12-regular tree @xmath35 , whose spectral radius is @xmath14 , the eigenvalue threshold in ramanujan graphs .",
    "in fact , greenberg and lubotzky  @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite*chapter 4 ) extended the alon - boppana bound to any family of general graphs in terms of the spectral radius of its universal cover ( also see @xcite*theorem  4.1 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that any lift of a @xmath12-regular base graph @xmath1 is itself @xmath12-regular and inherits all the original eigenvalues of @xmath1 .",
    "one hopes that the lift would also inherit the expansion properties of its base graph , and in particular that almost every cover of a ( small ) ramanujan graph will also be ramanujan .",
    "since our focus here is on lifts of ramanujan graphs ( regular by definition ) we restrict our attention to base graphs that are @xmath12-regular for @xmath26 .",
    "a random uniform @xmath0-lift of a base graph @xmath1 ( a uniform cover of @xmath1 with covering number @xmath0 ) has the following convenient description : it is the graph @xmath2 on the vertices @xmath3\\times v(g)$ ] , where for each edge @xmath4 in @xmath1 there is an independent uniform bijection @xmath5 , and @xmath2 has all edges of the form @xmath6 .",
    "the random lift of a complicated base - graph is thus a hybrid between the complex geometry of the quotient and the randomness due to the bijections .    in an important development in the study of the spectrum of random lifts friedman  @xcite showed in 2003 that with high probability ( w.h.p . )",
    "every `` new '' eigenvalue of an @xmath0-lift ( one that is not inherited from the base graph ) is at most @xmath36 , where @xmath7 is the largest eigenvalue of the base - graph and @xmath8 is the spectral - radius of its universal cover .",
    "when the base - graph @xmath1 is @xmath12-regular , @xmath14 and friedman s result implies that in its random @xmath0-lift @xmath2 the largest absolute value of all nontrivial eigenvalues is w.h.p .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes @xmath39 .",
    "conversely , @xmath40 and by alon - boppana it is also at least @xmath41 .",
    "this lower bound was conjectured by friedman  @xcite to be tight ( for general graphs he conjectured that all new eigenvalues are at most @xmath10 as in the greenberg - lubotzky bound ) .    in a recent paper  @xcite , linial and puder",
    "were able to significantly improve friedman s bound and show that w.h.p .",
    "all the new eigenvalues of @xmath2 are at most @xmath42 . consequently , an @xmath0-lift @xmath2 of a @xmath12-regular @xmath1 w.h.p .",
    "satisfies @xmath43 when @xmath1 is a @xmath12-regular expander with nontrivial eigenvalues of @xmath44 as is the case for ramanujan graphs , this translates to @xmath45 .",
    "our main result in this work is the new near optimal upper bound of @xmath46 when @xmath1 is @xmath12-regular with all nontrivial eigenvalues at most @xmath17 in absolute value .",
    "for @xmath47 it substantially improves the known bounds , , and when @xmath48 as in ramanujan graphs it is tight up to a logarithmic factor , giving @xmath49 .",
    "[ thm-1 ] let @xmath1 be a @xmath12-regular graph with all nontrivial eigenvalues at most @xmath17 in absolute value and let @xmath14 be the spectral radius of its universal cover . let @xmath2 be a random @xmath0-lift of @xmath1 . for some explicit absolute constant @xmath50 ,",
    "every nontrivial eigenvalue of @xmath2 is at most @xmath51 in absolute value except with probability @xmath52 .",
    "[ cor-2 ] let @xmath1 be a @xmath12-regular ramanujan graph vertices and let @xmath2 be a random @xmath0-lift of @xmath1 . with probability @xmath53",
    "every nontrivial eigenvalue of @xmath2 is at most @xmath54 in absolute value , where @xmath50 is an explicit absolute constant .",
    "note that the above corollary implies that typical random @xmath0-lifts of ramanujan graphs are nearly ramanujan .",
    "no attempt was made to optimize the explicit constant in theorem  [ thm-1 ] .",
    "finally , the statement of theorem  [ thm-1 ] holds even when the size of the base - graph @xmath55 is allowed to grow with @xmath0 provided that @xmath0 is large enough in comparison ( e.g. , @xmath56 ) .",
    "the previous bounds on the spectra of random @xmath0-lifts of a fixed graph @xmath1 due to friedman  @xcite and linial and puder  @xcite were both obtained via wigner s trace method .",
    "the fact that the universal cover @xmath57 of a connected graph @xmath1 is the infinite tree of non - backtracking walks from an arbitrarily chosen vertex makes the trace method particularly useful for relating the new eigenvalues of the lift with @xmath8 , the spectral - radius of @xmath57 .",
    "even when the geometry of a graph is very well understood , bounding its nontrivial eigenvalues can be extremely challenging .",
    "for instance , a line of papers ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) established various bounds for the second eigenvalue of certain random regular graphs , culminating in the optimal bound @xmath58 for a uniformly chosen @xmath12-regular graph on @xmath0 vertices , proved by friedman  @xcite using highly sophisticated arguments .",
    "it turns out that this model is essentially the special case of an @xmath0-lift of a graph comprising a single vertex with self - loops : it is easy to see that for @xmath12 even , the random @xmath12-regular graph obtained by @xmath59 independent uniform permutations in @xmath60 is equivalent to an @xmath0-lift of the base - graph @xmath1 that has a single vertex with @xmath59 loops ( this model is in fact contiguous to the uniform random @xmath12-regular graph for @xmath61 , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) . unfortunately ,",
    "when the base - graph features a complex and rich structure ( e.g.  the lps - expanders , whose expansion properties hinge on a deep theorem of selberg ) it becomes significantly harder to control the spectrum of its lifts .",
    "indeed , there are many examples of geometric properties that have been pinpointed precisely for the random regular graph yet remain unknown for arbitrary expanders ( see @xcite for a recent such example ) .",
    "estimating the number of closed walks in lifts of arbitrary ramanujan graphs thus appears to be a formidable task .    in this work ,",
    "the bounds obtained for the spectra of lifts of arbitrary expanders rely on an approach introduced by kahn and szemerdi  @xcite , which is quite different from wigner s trace method .",
    "this approach was originally used to control the spectrum of a random regular graph , and several new ideas are required to adapt it to the more complicated geometry of the lifts considered here .    another related problem in the study of spectra of lifts , yet of a rather different nature , considers the @xmath62-lift of a base - graph ( rather than @xmath0-lifts of a small fixed graph ) .",
    "bilu and linial  @xcite showed that for any @xmath12-regular graph @xmath1 there _ exists _ a @xmath62-lift with all new eigenvalues at most @xmath63 .",
    "this was shown by means of the lovsz local lemma , combined with the crucial observation of  @xcite whereby the new eigenvalues correspond precisely to the eigenvalues of a _ signing _ of the adjacency matrix of @xmath1 ( the matrix obtained by replacing a subset of its @xmath64 entries by @xmath65 ) . in the absence of such a characterization when the covering number @xmath0 is large ,",
    "different tools are needed for the problem studied here , where we seek a bound that holds for almost every @xmath0-lift with @xmath0 sufficiently large .      as stated above , while a random @xmath12-regular graph @xmath1 has second eigenvalue @xmath66 w.h.p .",
    "( the @xmath22-term tending to @xmath23 as @xmath67 ) , the probability that @xmath1 is ramanujan is unknown . see  @xcite for some experimental results suggesting that this probability is bounded away from @xmath23 and @xmath64 . as this is essentially the simplest special case of a random lift ( the quotient being a single vertex with self - loops ) ,",
    "it is natural to conjecture the following :    [ conj-3 ] for any ramanujan graph @xmath1 there exist some @xmath68 such that its random @xmath0-lift @xmath2 satisfies @xmath69 , where the @xmath22-term tends to @xmath23 as @xmath28 .",
    "note that the limiting constant in the above conjecture depends on the base - graph @xmath1 , as it is plausible that its structure may affect the probability of being ramanujan .",
    "for instance , a random cover of a complete graph on @xmath70 vertices might behave quite differently compared to lifts of a sparse @xmath12-regular ramanujan graph .",
    "however , as we next elaborate , experimental results lead us to suspect that up to normalization this is not the case .",
    "figure  [ fig : lifts : a ] shows the cumulative distribution function ( c.d.f . ) of @xmath71 where @xmath2 is the @xmath72-lift of 3 different @xmath73-regular ramanujan base - graphs : @xmath74 ( complete graph on @xmath75 vertices ) , the @xmath76-vertex petersen graph and the @xmath77-vertex dodecahedral graph .",
    "each curve was evaluated from @xmath78 random lifts . in these simulations ,",
    "the probability of a random lift being ramanujan for each of these three base - graphs was bounded between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , aligning the number of vertices of the graph cover @xmath2 to be the same ( via @xmath72-lifts of the dodecahedral graph , @xmath81-lifts of the petersen graph and @xmath82-lifts of @xmath74 , giving @xmath83-vertex covers for each graph ) resulted in the curves of the individual c.d.f.s coinciding fairly accurately .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : lifts : b ] , in light of which we speculate that the following stronger version of the statement of conjecture  [ conj-3 ] holds .",
    "first , it seems plausible that for any integer @xmath20 the limiting distribution of the second eigenvalue of the random cover is independent of the base - graph .",
    "namely , there exists a distribution @xmath84 on @xmath85 $ ] such that for any @xmath12-regular ramanujan graph @xmath1 on @xmath55 vertices , the distribution of @xmath71 for its random @xmath0-lift @xmath2 converges to @xmath84 as @xmath28 .",
    "second , the strong fit between the curves after aligning the total graph sizes suggests that even the rate of convergence to @xmath84 depends on @xmath86 rather than on the geometry of the base - graph or even its relative size ( in case @xmath55 is allowed to depend to @xmath0 ) .",
    "of - course , one clearly needs some level of `` burn - in '' for the covering number @xmath0 compared to @xmath55 since the cover @xmath2 starts as ramanujan at @xmath87 .",
    "for example , it may be that for any @xmath88 the total - variation distance between the distribution of @xmath71 and @xmath84 decays as a function of @xmath89 alone , namely that @xmath90 where @xmath91 depends only on @xmath92 and tends to @xmath23 as @xmath93 .",
    "the base - graph @xmath1 from theorem  [ thm-1 ] corresponds to the algebraic definition of an expander known as an @xmath94-graph . an alternative closely - related criterion is the traditional definition of an expander graph in terms of its combinatorial edge or vertex expansion .",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath12-regular graph on @xmath55 vertices .",
    "the cheeger constant of @xmath1 ( also referred to as the edge isoperimetric constant ) is defined as @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in @xmath99 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is a @xmath100-edge - expander for some fixed @xmath101 if it satisfies @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , one defines a @xmath100-vertex - expander by replacing @xmath98 with the vertex boundary .    for @xmath1 as above the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix",
    "are @xmath103 by perron - frobenius .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is an @xmath94-graph if @xmath104 for all @xmath105 .",
    "this notion was introduced by alon in the 1980 s , motivated by the fact that when @xmath17 is much smaller than @xmath12 such graphs exhibit strong pseudo - random properties , resembling a random graph with edge density @xmath106 .",
    "a notable example of this is captured by the _ expander mixing lemma _ : if @xmath107 are ( not necessarily disjoint ) subsets of vertices of an @xmath94-graph then @xmath108 where @xmath109 ( @xcite*chapter 9 ) .",
    "relating the above two notions of expansion is the following well - known discrete analogue of cheeger s inequality bounding the first eigenvalue of a riemannian manifold ( alon  @xcite , alon - milman  @xcite , dodziuk  @xcite , jerrum - sinclair  @xcite ) : @xmath110 see the survey @xcite for further information on expanders .",

    "2 .   _ light pairs _ : the remaining pairs @xmath116 . here",
    "it was shown that two fixed vectors @xmath121 are unlikely to contribute more than @xmath44 to the bilinear form , and an @xmath122-net argument was used to extend this result to any unit vectors @xmath123 .    adapting this method to lifts of general graphs requires several additional ingredients . even in the simpler",
    "setting of @xcite , some of the arguments are only sketched and might prove difficult to complete in detail . more crucially ,",
    "in our case we have little knowledge of the base - graph @xmath1 , hence the study of both the `` heavy '' and `` light '' parts becomes significantly more involved .",
    "first , our only input on @xmath1 is the magnitude of its second eigenvalue , which turns the analysis of the heavy part into a delicate optimization problem , requiring two levels of dyadic expansions of the potential contributions to the final bilinear form .",
    "second , the consideration of the light part relies on a non - trivial martingale argument which may be useful in other applications : in the absence of sufficient control over the expectation ( due to the unknown contribution of the heavy part ) we resort to an @xmath124 analysis of the increments in the corresponding doob s martingale and apply a bernstein - kolmogorov type large deviation inequality due to freedman .      throughout the paper we use @xmath1 to denote the base - graph , a @xmath12-regular graph on @xmath55 vertices , and",
    "let @xmath2 denote its random @xmath0-lift .",

    "whenever @xmath131 are vertices in some graph whose identity is clear from the context , the abbreviation @xmath132 will denote that these two vertices are adjacent . for example , @xmath133 will usually stand for @xmath134 , which in turn implies that @xmath135 in @xmath1 by the definition of the lift .",
    "unless stated otherwise , all logarithms are using base @xmath62 and @xmath136 denotes the @xmath124 norm in the appropriate euclidean space .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : heavy ] deals with the contribution of the heavy pairs to the bilinear form @xmath119 . section  [ sec : light ] deals with the contribution of the light pairs . in the final section ,",
