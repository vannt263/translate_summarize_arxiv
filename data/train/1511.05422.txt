    "let @xmath0 be a simple graph and let @xmath3 be a proper coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "if a vertex @xmath4 in a color class @xmath5 of @xmath3 has no neighbors in another color class @xmath6 , then another proper coloring of @xmath0 can be obtained by simply changing the color of @xmath4 to @xmath6 . therefore ,",
    "if this holds for every vertex of color class @xmath5 , then we can obtain a proper coloring that uses fewer colors . because finding the chromatic number of a graph is @xmath2-hard , one can not expect to always get a good result by iteratively applying this method .",
    "on the basis of this idea , irving and manlove introduced the notion of b - coloring @xcite . intuitively , a b - coloring is a proper coloring that can not be improved by the described heuristic , and the b - chromatic number @xmath1 measures the worst possible such coloring .",
    "finding @xmath1 was proved to be @xmath2-hard in general graphs @xcite , and remains so even when restricted to bipartite graphs @xcite , chordal graphs @xcite , or line graphs @xcite .",
    "in the same article , irving and manlove also introduced a simple upper bound for @xmath1 , defined as follows .",
    "@xmath7-degree of @xmath0 _ is the maximum integer @xmath8 for which there are at least @xmath8 edges of degree at least @xmath9 ; we denote it by @xmath10 . because the existence of a b - coloring with @xmath8 colors forces the existence of @xmath8 vertices of degree @xmath11",
    ", we get : @xmath12    they then proved that @xmath13 whenever @xmath0 is a tree . since then , it has been discovered that the graph needs only to be `` locally acyclic '' in order to have this property , in other words , it is known that @xmath13 whenever @xmath0 has girth at least  7 @xcite .",
    "a number of other results investigate graphs with high b - chromatic number when compared to @xmath10 ; for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "a natural question is whether this property carries on to the edge version of the problem , that is , whether the b - chromatic number of the line graph @xmath0 of a tree is also at least @xmath14 .",
    "the answer to this question is `` yes '' , if @xmath0 is the line graph of a caterpillar @xcite , but it is `` no '' for general trees , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , here we show that deciding whether the b - chromatic number of @xmath0 is at least @xmath8 can be done in polynomial time , when @xmath0 is the line graph of a tree .",
    "this , together with the result on caterpillars , are the only positive results on a subclass of chordal graphs , up to our knowledge .",
    "we believe that our algorithm can be adapted to work on any block graph .",
    "however , the generalization to bigger subclasses of chordal graphs , for instance interval graphs , poses much harder difficulties .",
    "our algorithm was inspired on a previous fixed - parameter algorithm for block graphs presented in  @xcite ( we mention that the fixed - parameter decision problem is open for general graphs ) .",
    "consider @xmath15 with cardinality @xmath8 , and , for each @xmath16 , consider a subset @xmath17 of size @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the graph obtained from @xmath0 by turning each subset @xmath17 into a clique ; also , let @xmath3 be the precoloring of @xmath18 where each @xmath16 is colored with a distinct color , and no other vertex is colored .",
    "note that if @xmath3 can be extended to the whole graph @xmath18 , then the same extension is a b - coloring of @xmath0 having @xmath19 as basis . in  @xcite",
    ", marx proves that if @xmath18 is a chordal graph , then deciding whether the precoloring can be extended to @xmath18 can be done in polynomial time .",
    "sampaio and silva observed that if @xmath0 is a block graph , then the obtained graph @xmath18 is chordal .",
    "they presented their result separatedly in  @xcite and @xcite , and in @xcite it is observed that this leads to a fixed - parameter - algorithm for block graphs : it suffices to test whether the extension exists , for every possible subset @xmath19 , and for every family of subsets @xmath20 .    here",
    ", we consider line graphs of trees ( which equals claw - free block graphs ) and use a flow network representation of a b - coloring of @xmath0 ( this is similar to the one used by marx in  @xcite ) ; then , we use a dynamic programming algorithm to eliminate the need for an exponential number of tests .",
    "we believe that our algorithm can be made to work on general block graphs , and maybe even on larger classes , provided that the auxiliary graph constructed as in the previous paragraph is still chordal . however ,",
    "we do not believe that this class is much larger ; for instance , if @xmath16 has a @xmath21 , ( @xmath22 ) , in its neighborhood and @xmath23 , then already we get a @xmath24 in the auxiliary graph .    before we start , we need some formal definitions .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph .",
    "a @xmath8-coloring of @xmath0 is a function @xmath25 , and it is said to be _ proper _ if @xmath26 , whenever @xmath27 . consider @xmath3 to be a proper @xmath8-coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "the _ color class @xmath5 ( of @xmath3 ) _ is the subset of vertices @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath19 realizes distinct colors _ if each vertex of @xmath19 realizes a color , and the set of realized colors equals @xmath32 . if @xmath3 is such that every color is realized by some vertex , then we say that @xmath3 is a _ b - coloring of @xmath0_. also , a subset containing exactly one vertex that realizes @xmath5 , for each color class @xmath5 , is called a _",
    "basis of @xmath3_. a vertex @xmath33 is said to be _ @xmath8-dense _",
    "if @xmath34 , and the set of all @xmath8-dense vertices of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath35 . clearly , if @xmath3 is a b - coloring of @xmath0 with @xmath8 colors with basis @xmath19 , then @xmath15 .",
    "the _ b - chromatic number of @xmath0 _ , denoted by @xmath1 , is the maximum integer @xmath8 for which @xmath0 has a b - coloring with @xmath8 colors .",
    "a graph is called a _ block graph _ if its 2-connected components are cliques , and it is _ claw - free _ if it does not have an induced subgraph isomorphic to @xmath36 ( the complete bipartite graph with parts of size 1 and 3 , also known as `` claw '' ) .",
    "it is well known , and not hard to verify , that the class of claw - free block graphs equals the class of line graphs of trees . in the remainder of the text",
    ", we refer only to claw - free block graphs , and consider the graph to be rooted at some block .    here , we want to decide , given a claw - free block graph @xmath0 and an integer @xmath8 , whether @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the size of a largest clique in @xmath0 . clearly , the answer is always `` no '' when @xmath39 , and , because @xmath0 is a chordal graph ( which means that @xmath40 ) , the answer is `` yes '' when @xmath41 .",
    "thus , from now on we suppose that @xmath42 . to solve the problem , we compute the maximum size of a subset @xmath19 that realizes distinct colors on a @xmath8-coloring of @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , we will get @xmath37 if and only if the maximum size of such a set is @xmath8 .",
    "the idea is then to compute this value for smaller subgraphs of @xmath0 and then try to combine these solutions . for this , we need a more convenient way to represent a solution . in the next section ,",
    "given a subset @xmath19 that can realize distinct colors in a @xmath8-coloring , we show another representation of such a @xmath8-coloring related to @xmath19 .",
    "then , in the following section , we show how to combine the partial solutions .",
    "before we start , we need some further definitions . consider a claw - free block graph @xmath0 rooted at some block @xmath43 , an integer @xmath42 , and a subset @xmath15 .",
