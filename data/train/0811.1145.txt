    "@xcite and @xcite presented an assessment of the ability of lte modeling performed with the atlas9 code @xcite to fit the near uv band of the sun and the k1.5 - 2 iii giant arcturus ( @xmath3 boo , hr5430 , hd124897 ) , respectively .",
    "the former paper included an assessment of the quality of various input line lists , and found that the line list that provided the best match to the detailed high resolution near uv solar spectrum allowed too much flux to escape in the near uv band , making the model too bright compared to absolute spectrophotometric measurements in the near uv .",
    "the latter paper made the case for a hitherto undiscovered source of continuum thermal extinction in the near uv band of early k giants on the grounds that lte models and synthetic spectra computed with _",
    "any _ line lists , including the most complete ones , predicted significantly more flux in the near uv band than was observed . in the same year as the latter paper , @xcite also examined the ability of various line lists to provide a fit to the near uv band solar spectrum , and concluded that there may still be missing near uv extinction in models of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the lte studies of @xcite and @xcite were improved by non - lte ( nlte ) modeling of arcturus @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) and the sun @xcite ( hereafter paper ii ) carried out with the phoenix multi - purpose atmospheric modeling and spectrum synthesis code @xcite .",
    "the results of paper i and paper ii were that more realistic nlte modeling only made the near uv band discrepancies found with lte models by @xcite and @xcite even worse as a result of nlte over - ionization of partially lifting the `` iron curtain '' of near uv line extinction , thus making models even brighter in the near uv . that suffers nlte over - ionization ( or , more properly ,",
    "lte _ under_-ionization ! ) in late type stars is not a new result ( for , example , see @xcite ) , but paper i and ii presented the first quantitative assessment of the effect on solar near uv @xmath1 levels with atomic models of and containing over 1000 atomic @xmath4 levels combined , and accounting for non - local multi - species coupling due to over - lapping transitions ( shared radiation fields ) among dozens of relatively abundant chemical species .    in this paper",
    "we investigate two ways of addressing the problem of atmospheric models of late - type stars being too bright in the near uv band : 1 ) we revisit the suggestion of @xcite that there may be missing continuum thermal extinction in the near uv , but on the basis of nlte modeling rather than lte modeling , and 2 ) we attempt to construct semi - empirical models of the atmospheric temperature structure @xmath5 that more closely match the observed near uv flux levels .",
    "we also attempt to map out the dependence of a possible source of missing continuum extinction by investigating its dependence on stellar parameters among an ( admittedly ) small set of stars for which there is both high quality spectrophotometry that extends into the near uv band , and high quality high resolution near uv band spectra : namely , the sun ( g2 v ) , arcturus ( k2 iii ) , and procyon ( f5 iv - v , @xmath3 cmi , hr 2943 , hd 61421 ) .",
    "we have assembled four relatively recent independent measurements of the solar irradiance spectrum in the visible and near uv bands , which are presented in fig .",
    "[ sun_flxcmpuv ] .",
    "the four data sets are most discrepant with each other in the near uv band , as described is greater detail below , and , in the case of the data sets of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , this may be because the correction for air mass extinction is more difficult in the near uv than in the visible band .",
    "the four data gets were re - sampled at the sampling interval of the highest resolution data set , @xmath7    @xcite , and then each was convolved to the resolution of the most coarsely sampled data - set , @xmath8 at 3500    ( @xmath9 )    @xcite .",
    "for this aspect of our investigation , we are concerned with the fit of models to the overall @xmath1 level on the intermediate - band scale , rather than to finer spectral features .",
    "@xcite presents a heavily cited construction of the irradiance based on measurements of the disk center intensity spectrum , @xmath10 , combined with fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) spectra and center - to - limb variation data obtained with the mcmath solar telescope at kitt peak , and is the data set to which we compared phoenix models in paper ii .",
    "their short wavelength data set spans the 3300 to 6300    range in intervals of 10  .    like @xcite",
    ", @xcite also constructed the irradiance in bands of @xmath9    from @xmath10 measurements made in the 3100 to 6850    range with the 0.23 m solar telescope at peak terskol .",
    "they estimate the uncertainty in their measured @xmath1 values to be @xmath11 in the near uv band .",
    "they note that their irradiance values are @xmath12 higher in the 3100 to 4000    range than those measured by @xcite ( notwithstanding high frequency oscillations in the comparison at the wavelengths of the fraunhofer lines ) as seen in their fig . 11 , and they conclude that the values of @xcite are too low .",
    "@xcite measured the irradiance in the 3295 to 8000    range in @xmath13    bands with the 0.6 m morgan telescope at lowell observatory using pinhole optics to reproduce a stellar - like image of the sun , and calibrating their measurements against similar measurements of the standard star vega .",
    "they estimate the internal error of their @xmath1 values to be @xmath14 .",
    "they also find that their values on wavelength scales wider than that of fraunhofer lines in the 3500 to 4500    range are as much as @xmath15 larger than those of @xcite , and this discrepancy can clearly be seen in their fig . 6 .",
    "@xcite report space based measurements of the near uv and visible band irradiance made with the uv and vis spectrometers of the solspec instrument that was part of the atlas payloads and the sosp instrument on board the eureca satellite .",
    "the uv spectra span the 2000 to 3600    range in 4    @xmath16 intervals , and in the 3400 to 8500    range in 10    intervals .",
    "their study includes comparisons between the solspec and sosp instruments and other space - based measurements that were made at about the same time , and finds agreement among them at the level of less than @xmath17 .",
    "a special advantage of this data set in the near uv band compared to the others compiled here is that the correction for air mass extinction is obviated for space - based observations .",
    "@xcite reports a comparison between the visible band data described in @xcite and the data of @xcite , and panel _ e ) _ of their fig .",
    "2 and their table v also show that their values are @xmath18 larger than @xcite in the 3500 to 4000    region .",
    "@xcite presents a compilation of @xmath1 distributions of a large sample of stars , including 1 ) their own measurements made at the crimean astrophysical observatory , 2 ) measurements from the `` sternberg spectrophotometric catalogue '' ( see @xcite and references therein ) consisting of data taken from 1970 to 1984 with the 40 cm and 60 cm telescopes of the crimean station of the sternberg astronomical institute and the 50 cm telescope of the fessenkov astrophysical institute , and 3 ) measurements of @xcite taken with the 50 cm cassegrain telescope and spectrum scanner with a photo - multiplier tube taken at the fessenkov astrophysical institute from 1968 to 1986 .",
    "these data sets all generally cover the @xmath19 range 3200 to 8000    with @xmath20    or @xmath21  , and have been re - reduced to a common spectrophotometric system ( the `` chilean system '' ) by @xcite . @xcite and @xcite state that the internal accuracy of their @xmath1 measurements is @xmath22 .",
    "arcturus and procyon are among the stars for which data was reported in all three of these sources .    additionally , for procyon , which is the brightest of the three objects in the uv band , we were also able to obtain a mid - uv spectrum recorded with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) space based observatory in the `` long wavelength '' band ( lwr09108 in the newsips iue archive ) .",
    "this data set covers the @xmath19 range from 1850    to 3350  , and provides a check on the ability of the models to fit the @xmath1 distribution at shorter wavelengths .",

    "the spectral resolution , @xmath23 , is @xmath24 in the near uv , but we have degraded the data set to @xmath25 by convolution with a gaussian kernel to reproduce a more typical `` high resolution '' stellar spectrum , and to aid comparison with synthetic spectra computed with a realistic sampling , @xmath16 . the spectrum is useful for the present investigation as long as @xmath23 is sufficiently large for weak spectral lines to be fully resolved .",
    "@xcite independently obtained a full disk spectrum of the sun with the same instrument and similar @xmath23 value .",
    "we also include the latter in our comparison to assess the variance among data sets .",
    "we note that the latter spectrum is darker by about 0.02 to 0.05@xmath26 ( where @xmath26 is the continuum flux level ) than the atlas of @xcite in the cores of some , but not all , strong features such as the cn band head at @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ sun_atlas1 ] ) and the h and k lines , although the two spectra are in close agreement for weaker features , and in the pseudo - continuum .",
    "this non - systematic variance complicates the assessment of models based on high resolution spectra because it is precisely in the cores of strong features that the role of the continuous extinction manifests itself .",
    "[ [ arcturus ] ] arcturus + + + + + + + + +    @xcite have obtained a high resolution ( @xmath28 ) spectrum with the kpno coud feed telescope and echelle spectrograph .",
    "we note that the observed spectrum only covers wavelengths down to @xmath29  . because @xcite concluded that a surprisingly large amount of extra near uv opacity was needed to fit the high resolution photographic spectrum of @xcite",
    ", we also incorporate a comparison of the observed spectrum of @xcite ( also of @xmath30 in the near uv ) to that of @xcite .",
    "we find that the two observed spectra are in close agreement , except that in the spectrum of @xcite strong absorption features tend to be not as deep as those of the spectrum of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite commented on the difficulty and subjectivity of establishing a continuum rectification ( @xmath26 level ) in the blue and near uv band as a result of over - blanketing by spectral lines , particularly in the vicinity of the h and k lines ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) as a result of the broad van der waals damping wings that affect @xmath1 throughout the 3900 to 4000    range .",
    "given the difficulties of calibrating photographic data , and correcting it for background scattered light , as well as the uncertainty in continuum placement , the discrepancy is not surprising .",
    "however , given that @xcite based their conclusions on their result that synthetic spectra have spectral absorption features that were too strong , it behooves us to investigate the extent to which that conclusion may be weakened by comparison to the @xcite spectrum .",
    "[ [ procyon ] ] procyon + + + + + + + +    @xcite have created a high resolution spectral atlas of procyon in the @xmath19 3150 to 7500    range based on spectra obtained with the coud spectrograph of the mount wilson 100-inch reflector .",
    "we note that , like the spectral atlas of @xcite , the detector was a photographic emulsion .",
    "based on the instrumental profile described in @xcite , we estimate that @xmath33 in the near uv band ( fwhm @xmath34 ) .",
    "the same difficulty of continuum rectification in the near uv band that was discussed above for the arcturus spectroscopy also applies to procyon , as noted in @xcite .",
    "we have computed model structures and synthetic spectra for the three program stars that explore a number of variations in the modeling .",
    "the details of the modeling are as described in papers i and ii .",
    "the same modeling procedure is used for all three objects , except that arcturus is modeled with spherical geometry because of its lower surface gravity ( @xmath35 ) , whereas the sun and procyon are modeled with plane - parallel geometry .",
    "we note that our models are in radiative - convective equilibrium ( re ) , and , thus , do not exhibit chromospheric or coronal heating in their outer atmospheres , which is caused by non - radiative processes .",
    "therefore , our models do not have inversions in the @xmath5 structure , and can not reproduce near uv spectral features that are chromospheric in origin ( eg . the h & k line cores ) .",
    "however , for @xmath36  , the flux in the continuum , and in weak to moderately strong spectral lines , arises from layers of the atmosphere that are well below the depth of temperature minimum , @xmath37 , in semi - empirical chromospheric models of the sun ( see @xcite and references therein ) and arcturus ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , as long as we avoid any attempt to interpret the fit to the cores of highly opaque lines where the flux arises from the outer atmosphere , then the @xmath5 structure of our models should be relevant to the spectral features being studied .",
    "similarly , our models are static and horizontally homogeneous , and so do not account for the complex spatial and temporal structures on a variety of scales that have been observed in the solar atmosphere . with the exception of sunspots and the granulation pattern ,",
    "these structures ( plages , faculae , k bright points ) exist in the chromospheric layers and are probably related to the non - radiative chromospheric heating mechanism , and , as mentioned above , our models do not account for the chromospheric @xmath5 structure in any case .      in table [ stelpar ]",
    "we present the values of the stellar atmospheric parameters used in our modeling .",
    "our parameters for arcturus and the sun are those of papers i and ii , respectively , and justification for our choices can be found there .",
    "we re - iterate here that we have chosen to investigate solar models that are based on the `` traditional '' abundances , @xmath38 $ ] , of @xcite rather than the newer abundances of @xcite derived from horizontally inhomogeneous models for consistency with the horizontally homogeneous solar atmospheric modeling of @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently carried out a simultaneous atmospheric model fit to the spectrophotometric @xmath1 distributions and near ir band interferometry for procyon , and included multi - component modeling with combinations of synthetic @xmath1 distributions from 1d atmospheric models computed with phoenix to approximately simulate the effect of horizontal inhomogeneity .",
    "they find best fit values for the stellar parameters of @xmath39 in the range @xmath40 to @xmath41 k , @xmath42 equal to @xmath43 , metallic @xmath44 $ ] equal to 0.0 , a depth - independent value of the microturbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath45 , equal to @xmath46 km s@xmath47 , and a value of the mixing length used in the approximate treatment of convection , @xmath48 , in the range 0.5 to 1.25 , where @xmath49 is the pressure scale height .",

    "for comparison to high resolution spectroscopy , we also produced continuum rectified synthetic spectra by dividing the synthetic @xmath1 distribution by a corresponding synthetic pure continuum distribution computed without line extinction .",
    "the synthetic spectra were computed with a sampling , @xmath16 , ranging from 0.015    at @xmath51    to 0.04    at @xmath52   , corresponding to a spectral resolution , @xmath23 , of @xmath53 .",
    "this ensured that weak spectral lines were at least critically sampled .",
    "the spectra were then resampled and convolved with an appropriate kernel to match the @xmath23 value of the observed spectra to which they were being compared .",
    "model lte - big is computed in lte using the `` big '' input line list that includes the full set of spectral absorption lines described by @xcite , including millions of atomic lines , largely of fe - group elements , that were theoretically predicted , but have not been observed in the laboratory .",
    "@xcite found that this big line list was necessary to provide sufficient line blanketing of the synthetic @xmath1 distribution in the near uv band of a solar atmospheric model to provide a good match to the observed @xmath1 distribution of @xcite .",

    "the sun was the only object for which this variation was either feasible or necessary .      for each of the program stars ,",
    "we produce nlte - extra models by enhancing , _ ad hoc _ , the value of the continuous mass extinction co - efficient , @xmath55 , in the wavelength range where the discrepancy with the observed @xmath1 distribution was most severe , which was @xmath57    in all cases .",
    "the @xmath58 distribution was enhanced in the affected @xmath16 range by adding to @xmath55 the value of @xmath59 , where @xmath59 is the continuum thermal absorption coefficient computed in lte , and @xmath60 is a @xmath19-independent _ ad hoc _ factor .",
    "the @xmath61 expresses the continuum extinction caused by the thermal destruction of photons only , as opposed to scattering extinction ; _ ie .",
    "_ @xmath62 , where , @xmath63 is the continuum scattering extinction coefficient . as a result",
    ", this enhancement models the effect of an as yet unaccounted for source of extinction that is purely thermal in that it only destroys and thermally emits photons rather than scattering them .",
    "the value of @xmath60 was chosen separately for each program star based on visual inspection of the comparison of the observed and synthetic nlte @xmath1 distributions , and is reported in table [ tabfudge ] .",
    "we note that given the speculative nature of this study , it was not our intention to determine the precise value of @xmath60 that minimizes a statistical measure of the goodness of the @xmath1 fit , but , rather , to investigate whether such an _ ad hoc _",
    "@xmath55 enhancement can plausibly improve the fit of nlte models to both the absolute @xmath1 distribution and the rectified high resolution spectrum .",
    "the models with enhanced @xmath55 were then re - converged before computing the synthetic @xmath1 distribution so that the models are internally consistent .",
    "we find that the thermal equilibrium @xmath64 structure of both the sun and arcturus , for both lte and nlte models , is negligibly affected by @xmath55 enhancement below @xmath19 values of 4200   because the fraction of the star s bolometric flux being transferred in the uv band is small .",
    "@xcite found the same result for arcturus with lte atlas9 modeling .",
    "we produce the nlte - cool model by adjusting the @xmath2 structure of the nlte model downward in value by an offset , @xmath66 , that has its maximum amplitude , @xmath67 , at the top of the atmospheric model , which effectively has @xmath68 , and decreases linearly in value with increasing standard continuum logarithmic optical depth , @xmath69 , to 0 near standard optical depth unity ( @xmath70 ) , from around which depth the emergent visible and near ir band continuum flux ( @xmath26 ) arises .",
    "the temperature offset at each depth in the model is computed as    @xmath71 ,    restricted to the range @xmath72 , where the slope , @xmath73 , is given by @xmath74 , and @xmath75 because we are always cooling the atmosphere rather than heating it .",
    "the @xmath76 depth range is where alterations to the @xmath2 structure would most clearly amount to changing the _ de facto _",
    "@xmath39 value of the model as determined by the measured continuum flux distribution , @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , to maintain some distinction between perturbations of @xmath2 for a model of given @xmath39 and perturbations to the @xmath39 value itself , we restrict @xmath65 alterations to the @xmath78 range .",
    "the coupled equation of state ( eos ) , hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) , and the nlte statistical equilibrium rate equations , and radiative transfer equation , were reconverged for the resulting model , but with the temperature correction procedure disabled so that a self - consistent model with the new @xmath5 structure was computed , then a synthetic @xmath1 distribution for this model was computed .",
    "the value of @xmath67 was chosen by visual inspection of the fit of the resulting synthetic @xmath1 distribution to the observed near uv band @xmath1 values .",
    "this procedure is effectively semi - empirical modeling of the atmospheric @xmath65 structure with the near uv band @xmath1 distribution as the sole diagnostic .",
    "for the sun , @xmath79 k. for arcturus , the most extreme value of @xmath80 that we were able to investigate was 1500 k , and we found that there was no value of @xmath80 that would sufficiently reduce the computed near uv @xmath1 distribution without the @xmath5 structure becoming so extreme that the fit to the well observed visible band @xmath1 distribution was lost , and , for the most extreme values , the population re - convergence became numerically unstable .",
    "fig . [ sun_flxcmpuv ] shows the comparison of all four observed solar @xmath1 distributions with with the computed @xmath1 distributions from models with various treatments of the thermodynamic equilibrium and @xmath55 . table [ tabsunstats ] presents , as a quantitative measure of the relative goodness of fit , the root mean square ( rms ) of the deviation of the synthetic from the observed @xmath1 distribution relative to the observed distribution , @xmath81 , computed from interpolated pixel - wise relative deviations in the 3500 to 4000    range ,    @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the synthetic and observed @xmath1 distributions , respectively , and @xmath85 is the number of elements of the common @xmath19 sampling to which all @xmath1 distributions have been interpolated .",
    "the @xmath81 values have been quoted only to the first distinguishing digit .    as reported in paper ii , model lte - big",
    "reproduces the observed @xmath1 relatively well , thus confirming the results of the atlas modeling of @xcite . also , as reported in paper ii , the nlte model significantly over - predicts the @xmath1 values in the near uv band . in paper",
    "ii we attributed the entire discrepancy between the @xmath1 values of the lte - big and nlte models to nlte effects , particularly nlte over - ionization of by the uv band radiation field .",
    "however , a factor that was neglected in paper ii is that their lte model incorporated the `` big '' atomic line list of @xcite ( _ ie . _",
    "their lte model is the same as our lte - big model ) , whereas their nlte model only incorporates the `` small '' line list that pre - dated the expansion of @xcite .",
    "therefore , some of the difference between the lte and nlte@xmath54 @xmath1 distributions is caused by the much larger number of lines included in the lte model compared to the nlte model .",
    "the model atoms used in the calculation of the nlte line extinction in phoenix must be consistent with the line list because any transitions not included in the nlte statistical equilibrium rate equations are taken from the line list .",
    "therefore , it is not currently possible to compute a nlte model with the `` big '' line list with phoenix . to remove the choice of line list as a variable , we have computed our lte - small model , which is more directly comparable to our nlte model , and to the nlte@xmath54 model of paper ii , than the lte model of paper ii is .",
    "in addition to the requirement of consistency , there is some justification for investigating the fit of models computed with the `` small '' line list in that the `` big '' line list has been controversial .",
    "the `` big '' list includes millions of transitions that were theoretically predicted using an approximate treatment of the quantum mechanical atomic physics , and , although these lines improved the broad - band fit to the solar uv @xmath1 distribution , comparison to high resolution solar uv spectra indicate that many of the @xmath86 values and transition energies are inaccurate , and that , moreover , many of the lines in the `` big '' line list seem to not actually exist @xcite .",
    "this very important point is also demonstrated again here in fig .",
    "[ atlasbig1 ] . in general , discrepancies between",
    "observed and synthetic spectra may be caused by errors in the @xmath19 values in the line list for individual lines that really exist .",
    "however , we note that the careful analysis by @xcite lead them to conclude that the `` big '' list really does _ systematically _ contain many lines of detectable strength that are either unobserved , or are much weaker , in the observed solar near uv and blue spectrum , whereas the reverse is not true , and this is also consistent with our experience . fig .",
    "[ atlasbig1 ] shows the comparison of the observed rectified high resolution solar spectrum of @xcite ( the spectrum of @xcite does not extend down into this @xmath19 range ) and synthetic spectra computed with the models lte - big and lte - small in the @xmath87 to @xmath88 region .",
    "examples of where the `` big '' line list leads to synthetic spectra with lines that are either too strong , or are altogether unobserved , are scattered through the near uv band , but this spectral range illustrates a number of easily discernible examples well .",
    "this point has been made by both @xcite and @xcite , but is important enough to be worth demonstrating here .",
    "on the this basis we proceed on the assumption that the `` big '' line list is less realistic than the `` small '' line list .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the lte - small synthetic @xmath1 distribution is also shown in fig .",
    "[ sun_flxcmpuv ] , where it can be seen that it , like the nlte synthetic @xmath1 distribution , also over - predicts the observed flux , although by not as much .",
    "therefore , the near uv band discrepancy between lte and nlte models reported in paper ii is reduced when consistent line lists are used .",
    "we conclude that the effect of nlte over - ionization , while still significant , is not as large as that reported in paper ii .",

    "however , including other solar irradiance measurements in the comparison weakens this conclusion .",
    "[ sun_flxcmpuv ] shows that the nlte synthetic @xmath1 distribution lies at the upper end , but within the range of , the @xmath1 values spanned by the four observed distributions , and is generally consistent with that measured by @xcite , except for a region around 3500  .",
    "we also note that the lte - big @xmath1 distribution , although consistent with the data of @xcite , is found to lie at the bottom of the range spanned by the four data sets , suggesting that the lte - big model actually under - predicts the near uv band flux , in contradiction to the conclusions drawn by both @xcite and in paper ii .",
    "by contrast , the lte - small model , being less bright in the uv band than the nlte model , lies well within the range spanned by the four data sets .",
    "this suggests that the `` big '' line list of @xcite actually contains too much line opacity to reproduce the observed near uv @xmath1 level , which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by @xcite based in high resolution spectroscopy . as a result ,",
    "given the range spanned by the four data sets , there is no observational basis for claiming that the , presumably more realistic , nlte model fits better than the lte - small model , and there is marginal evidence that it provide a _",
    "worse _ fit .",
    "this speaks to the need for a more precise observational determination of the uv band @xmath1 values .",
    "interestingly , the conclusion of both @xcite and paper ii that the lte - big model provides the best fit may be due to an unfortunate conspiracy of errors : the observed near uv @xmath1 values of @xcite are too low , if one were to assume that the other data sets are more accurate , and , at the same time , the `` big '' line list contains spurious extra near uv line opacity that produces an lte synthetic @xmath1 distribution that is also too low , thus apparently providing a good `` fit '' to the data that under - estimate the true flux level .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    as can be seen from table [ tabsunstats ] , the nlte - extra synthetic @xmath1 distribution , by design , provides closer agreement to the dataset of @xcite , whereas the nlte model with no additional extinction provides closer agreement to the data sets of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data set of @xcite does not discriminate clearly between the two models .",
    "this may be interpreted as marginal evidence for missing near uv band continuous thermal absorption opacity with an enhancement factor , @xmath60 , of approximately 0.15 , but , that conclusion depends on which of the observed @xmath1 distributions one uses in the comparison .",

    "<S> we investigate the ability of both lte and non - lte models to fit the near uv band absolute flux distribution , @xmath0 , and individual spectral line profiles of three standard stars for which high quality spectrophotometry and high resolution spectroscopy are available : the sun ( g2 v ) , arcturus ( k2 iii ) , and procyon ( f5 iv - v ) . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate 1 ) the effect of the choice of atomic line list on the ability of nlte models to fit the near uv band @xmath1 level , 2 ) the amount of a hypothesized continuous thermal absorption extinction source required to allow nlte models to fit the observations , and 3 ) the semi - empirical temperature structure , @xmath2 , required to fit the observations with nlte models and standard continuous near uv extinction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all models that are computed with high quality atomic line lists predict too much flux in the near uv band for arcturus , but fit the warmer stars well . </S>",
    "<S> the variance among independent measurements of the solar irradiance in the near uv is sufficiently large that we can not definitely conclude that models predict too much near uv flux , in contrast to other recent results . </S>",
    "<S> we surmise that the inadequacy of current atmospheric models of k giants in the near uv band is best addressed by hypothesizing that there is still missing continuous thermal extinction , and that the missing near uv extinction becomes more important with decreasing effective temperature for spectral classes later than early g , suggesting a molecular origin . </S>"
