    "<S> in the context of dynamical breaking of local supersymmetry ( supergravity ) , including the deser - zumino super - higgs effect , for the simple but quite representative cases of @xmath0 , @xmath1 supergravity , we discuss the emergence of starobinsky - type inflation , due to quantum corrections in the effective action arising from integrating out gravitino fields in their massive phase . </S>",
    "<S> this type of inflation may occur after a first - stage small - field inflation that characterises models near the origin of the one - loop effective potential , and it may occur at the non - trivial minima of the latter . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically realistic scenarios , compatible with the planck data , may be expected for the conformal supergravity variants of the basic model .    </S>",
    "<S> kcl - ph - th/2013-*39 * + lcts/2013 - 26    this short article serves as an _ addendum _ to our previous publication  @xcite , where we discussed dynamical breaking of supergravity ( sugra ) theories via gravitino condensation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we shall demonstrate the compatibility of this scenario with starobinsky - like  @xcite inflationary scenarios , which in our case can characterise the massive gravitino phase . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall argue , this is a second inflationary phase , that may succeed a first inflation which occurs in the flat region of the one - loop effective potential for the gravitino condensate field  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> starobinsky inflation is a model for obtaining a de sitter ( inflationary ) cosmological solution to gravitational equations arising from a ( four space - time - dimensional ) action that includes higher curvature terms , specifically of the type in which the quadratic curvature corrections consist only of scalar curvature terms  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is newton s ( gravitational ) constant in four space - time dimensions , with @xmath5 the planck mass , and @xmath6 is a constant of mass dimension one , characteristic of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> the important feature of this model is that inflationary dynamics are driven by the purely gravitational sector , through the @xmath7 terms , and the scale of inflation is linked to @xmath6 . from a microscopic point of view , the scalar curvature - squared terms in ( [ staroaction ] ) are viewed as the result of _ quantum fluctuations _ ( at one - loop level ) of conformal ( massless or high energy ) _ </S>",
    "<S> matter fields _ of various spins , which have been integrated out in the relevant path integral in a curved background space - time  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum mechanics of this model , by means of _ tunneling _ of the universe from a state of `` nothing '' to the inflationary phase of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been discussed in detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above considerations necessitate truncation to one - loop quantum order and to curvature - square ( four - derivative ) terms , which implies that there must be a region of validity for curvature invariants such that @xmath8 , which is a condition satisfied in phenomenologically realistic scenarios of inflation  @xcite , for which the inflationary hubble scale @xmath9 ( the reader should recall that @xmath10 in the inflationary phase ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the inflation in this model is not driven by fundamental rolling scalar fields , nevertheless the model ( [ staroaction ] ) ( and for that matter , any other model where the einstein - hilbert space - time lagrangian density is replaced by an arbitrary function @xmath11 of the scalar curvature ) is _ conformally equivalent _ to that of an ordinary einstein - gravity coupled to a scalar field with a potential that drives inflation  @xcite . to see this , </S>",
    "<S> one firstly linearises the @xmath7 terms in ( [ staroaction ] ) by means of an auxiliary ( lagrange - multiplier ) field @xmath12 , before rescaling the metric by a conformal transformation and redefining the scalar field ( so that the final theory acquires canonically - normalised einstein and scalar - field terms ) : @xmath13 these steps may be understood schematically via @xmath14 where the arrows have the meaning that the corresponding actions appear in the appropriate path integrals , with the potential @xmath15 given by : @xmath16 the potential is plotted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the potential is sufficiently flat to ensure slow - roll conditions for inflation are satisfied , in agreement with the planck data , for appropriate values of the scale @xmath18 ( which sets the overall scale of inflation in the model).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we observe that it is sufficiently flat for large values of @xmath17 ( compared to the planck scale ) to produce phenomenologically acceptable inflation , with the scalar field @xmath17 playing the role of the inflaton . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the starobinsky model fits excellently the planck data on inflation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum - gravity corrections in the original starobinsky model ( [ staroaction ] ) have been considered recently in @xcite from the point of view of an _ exact renormalisation - group _ ( rg ) analysis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the _ non - perturbative _ beta - functions for the ` running ' of newton s ` constant ' g and the dimensionless @xmath7 coupling @xmath19 in ( [ staroaction ] ) imply an _ asymptotically safe _ ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point for the former ( that is , g(@xmath20 ) @xmath21 constant , for some 4-momentum cutoff scale @xmath22 ) ) , in the spirit of weinberg  @xcite , and an attractive _ asymptotically - free _ </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath23 ) point for the latter . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of the @xmath7 coupling , required for agreement with inflationary observables  @xcite , is naturally ensured by the presence of the asymptotically free uv fixed point .    </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of the model of @xcite with the planck data triggered an enormous interest in the current literature in revisiting the model from various points of view , such as its connection with no - scale supergravity  @xcite and ( super)conformal versions of supergravity and related areas  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the latter works however the starobinski scalar field is fundamental , arising from the appropriate scalar component of some chiral superfield that appears in the superpotentials of the model . </S>",
    "<S> although of great value , illuminating a strong connection between supergravity models and inflationary physics , and especially for explaining the low - scale of inflation compared to the planck scale , these works contradict the original spirit of the starobinsky model ( [ staroaction ] ) where , as mentioned previously , the higher curvature corrections are viewed as arising from quantum fluctuations of matter fields in a curved space - time background such that inflation is driven by the pure gravity sector in the absence of fundamental scalars .    in a recent publication  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have considered an alternative inflationary scenario , in which , in the spirit of the original starobinsky model , the inflaton field was not a fundamental scalar but arose as a result of condensation ( in the scalar @xmath24-wave channel ) of the gravitino field in simple supergravity ( sugra ) models with spontaneous breaking of global supersymmetry ( susy ) via the super - higgs effect  @xcite , at a ( mass ) scale @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical breaking of sugra , in the sense of the generation of a mass for the gravitino field @xmath26 , whilst the gravitons remain massless , occurs in the model as a result of the four - gravitino interactions characterising the sugra action , arising from the torsionful contributions of the spin connection , characteristic of local supersymmetric theories . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop effective potential for the scalar gravitino condensate field @xmath27 has a double - well shape as a function of @xmath28 which is symmetric about the origin , as dictated by the fact that the sign of a fermion mass does not have physical significance . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical generation of the gravitino mass occurs at the non - trivial minima corresponding to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential of the @xmath28 field is also flat near the origin , and this has been identified in @xcite with the inflationary phase .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop effective potential was derived by first formulating the theory on a curved de sitter background  @xcite , with cosmological constant ( one - loop induced ) @xmath30 , and integrating out spin-2 ( graviton ) and spin 3/2 ( gravitino ) quantum fluctuations in a given class of gauges ( _ physical _ ) , before considering the flat limit @xmath31 in a self - consistent way . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed analysis in @xcite , performed in the _ physical gauge _ , has demonstrated that the dynamically broken phase is then stable ( in the sense of the effective action not being characterised by imaginary parts ) provided @xmath32 this result demonstrated the importance of the existence of global susy breaking scale for the stability of the phase where dynamical generation of gravitino masses occurs , which was not considered in the previous literature  @xcite  ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a conclusion could however not be reached in @xcite , as the role of the super - higgs effect , and the ` eating ' of the goldstino associated with the global susy breaking by the gravitino , was not included . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistency of the @xmath31 limit necessarily implies the vanishing of the one - loop effective potential at the non - trivial minima , which is a limiting case consistent with the supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this restricts the scale of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 in such a way that both scales must be of order of planck if the simplest four dimensional @xmath35 sugra model is considered . on the other hand , if one considers superconformal versions of sugra , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g_. those in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , then phenomenologically realistic scales for @xmath33 and @xmath28 of order of the grand unification scale , can appear , for appropriate values of the expectation value of the conformal factor , implying inflationary scenarios in perfect agreement with the planck data  @xcite , on equal footing to the original starobinski model . </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary period in this scenario is obtained by a simple embedding of the one - loop effective potential for the gravitino condensate field in a standard einstein - background gravity , where higher curvature corrections are ignored , whilst the end of the inflationary period coincides with the flat space - time limit that characterises the dynamical breaking of sugra at the non - trivial minima of the one - loop effective potential .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we would like to consider an extension of the analysis of @xcite , where the de sitter parameter @xmath36 is perturbatively small compared to @xmath37 , but not zero , so that truncation of the series to order @xmath38 suffices . </S>",
    "<S> this is in the spirit of the original starobinsky model  @xcite , with the role of matter fulfilled by the now - massive gravitino field . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we are interested in the behaviour of the effective potential near the non - trivial minimum , where @xmath39 is a non - zero constant . in our analysis , unlike starobinsky s original work , we will keep the contributions from _ both _ graviton ( spin - two ) and gravitino quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> notice that our one - loop analysis does not allow us to make any comment on asymptotic safety of the solution as in @xcite , as this would require detailed analysis based on exact rg which we do not perform here .    </S>",
    "<S> we firstly note that the one - loop effective potential , obtained by integrating out gravitons and ( massive ) gravitino fields in the scalar channel ( after appropriate euclideanisation ) , may be expressed as a power series in @xmath36 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the classical action with tree - level cosmological constant @xmath42 ( to be contrasted with the one - loop cosmological constant @xmath36 ) : @xmath43 with @xmath44 denoting the fixed @xmath45 background we expand around ( @xmath46 , volume = @xmath47 ) , and the @xmath48 s indicate the bosonic ( graviton ) and fermionic ( gravitino ) quantum corrections at each order in @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> the leading order term in @xmath36 is then the effective action found in @xcite in the limit @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the remaining quantum corrections then , proportional to @xmath36 and @xmath38 may be identified respectively with einstein - hilbert @xmath51-type and starobinsky @xmath7-type terms in an effective action ( [ effactionl3 ] ) of the form @xmath52 where we have combined terms of order @xmath38 into curvature scalar square terms . for general backgrounds such terms would correspond to invariants of the form @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which for a de sitter background all combine to yield @xmath55 terms </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 absorb the non - polynomial ( logarithmic ) in @xmath36 contributions , so that we may then identify with via @xmath58    to identify the conditions for phenomenologically acceptable starobinsky inflation around the non - trivial minima of the broken sugra phase of our model , we impose first the _ cancelation _ of the `` classical '' einstein - hilbert space term @xmath59 by the `` cosmological constant '' term @xmath60 , i.e. that @xmath61 . this condition should be understood as a necessary one characterising our background in order to produce phenomenologically - acceptable starobinsky inflation in the broken sugra phase following the first inflationary stage , as discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may naturally be understood as a generalisation of the relation @xmath62 , imposed in @xcite as a self - consistency condition for the dynamical generation of a gravitino mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective newton s constant in ( [ effactionl3 ] ) is then @xmath63 , and from this , we can express the effective starobinsky scale ( [ staroaction ] ) in terms of @xmath64 as @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition thus makes a direct link between the action ( [ effactionl2 ] ) with a starobinsky type action ( [ staroaction ] ) . comparing with ( [ staroaction ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we may then determine the starobinsky inflationary scale in this case as @xmath66    we may then determine the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 in order to evaluate the scale @xmath67 of the effective starobinsky potential given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : potstar ] in this case , and thus the scale of the second inflationary phase . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we use the results of @xcite , derived via an asymptotic expansion as explained in the appendix therein , to obtain the following forms for the coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the conformally - rescaled gravitational constant in the model of @xcite and @xmath71 is the v.e.v . of the conformal ( ` dilaton ' ) factor , </S>",
    "<S> assumed to be stabilised by means of an appropriate potential . in the case of standard @xmath72 sugra , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we note at this stage that the spin - two parts , arising from integrating out graviton quantum fluctuations , are not dominant in the conformal case  @xcite , provided @xmath74 , which leads  @xcite to the agreement of the first inflationary phase of the model with the planck data  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , if the first phase is succeeded by a starobinsky phase , it is the latter only that needs to be checked against the data .    </S>",
    "<S> we search numerically for points in the parameter space such that ; the effective equations @xmath75 are satisfied , @xmath36 is small and positive ( @xmath76 , to ensure the validity of our expansion in @xmath36 ) and @xmath77 , to match with known phenomenology of starobinsky inflation @xcite .    for @xmath78 ( i.e. for non - conformal supergravity ) , we were unable to find any solutions satisfying these constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this of course may not be surprising , given the previously demonstrated non - phenomenological suitability of this simple model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider @xmath79 however , we find that we are able to satisfy the above constraints for a range of values . </S>",
    "<S> we present this via the two representative cases below , indicated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2a ] , [ fig:2b ] , where we have the gravitino mass @xcite @xmath80 @xmath25 is the scale of global supersymmetry breaking , and we have set the normalisation scale via @xmath81 . </S>",

    "<S> exit from the inflationary phase is a complicated issue which we shall not discuss here , aside from the observation that it can be achieved by coherent oscillations of the gravitino condensate field around its minima , or tunnelling processes  la vilenkin  @xcite . </S>",
