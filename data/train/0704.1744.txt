    "it is widely expected that glast will detect a large number ( probably between 3,000 and 10,000 ) of extragalactic sources , most of which will be identified as blazars or radio galaxies .",
    "this very rich sample will be used to study the gamma - ray properties of blazars in great detail . however , in order to secure good samples of candidate gamma - ray sources and to understand the multi - frequency behavior of blazars from a statistical viewpoint , it is very useful to create sizable and well defined samples of blazars discovered in other wave - bands ( see , for instance , the @xmath1 , massaro et al . , these proceedings ) . in this contribution we present the preliminary results from two surveys that approach this issue from two different perspectives : i ) the wmap 3-year 1  jy sample of blazars selected at 41 ghz which defines a microwave selected sample ; ii ) the survey of serendipitous blazars detected in swift x - ray images centered on grbs , which defines a combined x - ray / radio selected sample of faint ( f@xmath2 10 mjy at 1.4 ghz , @xmath0 ) blazars .",
    "the catalog of bright point - like sources detected in the wmap 3-yr data includes 323 objects @xcite with microwave fluxes larger than @xmath3 0.5 jy . however , close to the lowest flux level the sample is largely incomplete .",
    "we selected a subsample of 219 sources with 41 ghz flux larger than 1 jy , that , based on the observed flux distribution , can be considered complete above this flux level and is therefore best suited for statistical studies . since all these sources are also bright at cm wavelength the large majority of them are well studied radio sources and a good amount of information about their nature is available in the literature . to identify all objects in the sample we checked several web - based archives and literature services and found the following class distribution : fsrq ( 156 sources ) , bl lacs ( 29 ) , ssrq ( 9 ) , radio galaxies ( 17 ) , staburst galaxies ( 2 ) , planetary nebulae ( 1 ) and 5 still unidentified objects . the final sample will be published in the near future and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of all sources will be made available on the web .",

    "[ fig.wmap_bl ] shows the sed of the blazar wmap  133 built using data from the literature , wmap data and optical / uv and x - ray data from swift satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the glast sensitivity is also plotted to show that blazars so bright at microwave frequencies can easily detected by glast .",
    "as of today , swift has discovered over 200 gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , a large fraction of which have been observed with its x - ray ( xrt ) and optical - uv ( uvot ) telescopes , to monitor the afterglow for several days or weeks .",
    "this resulted in the accumulation of x - ray images that when co - added reach exposures ranging from @xmath4 to over one million seconds , and sensitivity reaching @xmath5 in the soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray band ( e.g. see fig .",
    "[ fig.grbdeep ] ) .",
    "these x - ray images are particularly well suited for statistical purposes since they make an unbiased survey , as grbs explode at random position in the sky , are very deep in the x - ray band ( 10@xmath6 ) .",
    "we have so far analyzed in a standard way the co - added xrt images of 130 grbs with exposures ranging from 40,000 to over 600,000 seconds . within the 90 fields that are at high galactic latitude ( @xmath7 deg ) we have detected over 7,000 point - like sources , 164",
    "of which coincide ( within 10 arc - seconds ) with a radio source in the nvss , first or sumss survey . from a cross - correlation of this sample 164 sources with catalogs of known objects we found that none of them was previously known . to start the optical identification program we used the spectra from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite . as an example fig .",
    "[ fig.swift_bl ] ( left ) shows the sdss image of the field centered on swift - xrt  j005503 + 1408.0 : only one optical candidate is present within the 5 arc - seconds xrt error radius .",
    "table [ tab : a ] lists the eight objects for which we have found a spectrum in the sdss database .",
    "all source are extragalactic with redshift ranging from 0.133 to 1.668 .",
    "figure [ fig.swift_bl ] ( right ) shows the sed of another blazar candidate ( swift - xrt  j015700 + 0854.0 ) which clearly shows an energy distribution consistent with that of a blazar .",

    "we have presented the preliminary results from two statistically complete and unbiased surveys of blazars that can be used to : a )  determine the gamma - ray properties of well defined samples blazars when the glast survey data will be available , and b )  determine the statistical properties of blazars over a wide dynamical range , including a precise estimate of the contribution of blazars to the unresolved gamma - ray background .",
    "we plan to publish the final results on the wmap 3-year sample before the launch of glast and more complete results on a sample of serendipitous blazars found in about 200 grb fields by the end of 2007 .",
