    "the analysis of many natural and social phenomena is hindered by the fact that one can not replicate the dynamical evolution of the system under study .",
    "this may happen , for instance , for earthquakes @xcite , solar flares @xcite , large eco - systems @xcite , and financial markets @xcite .",
    "if with a single time series available we try to accommodate the historical data within a stochastic process description , we must assume a priori the existence of some statistical quantities which remain stable over time @xcite .",
    "this entitles us to sample their values at different stages of the historical evolution , rather than at different instances of the process .",
    "for example , in the analysis of historical series in finance it is usual to assume the stationarity of the distribution of return fluctuations and hence to detect their statistical features through sliding time interval empirical sampling .",
    "however , the plausible @xcite nonstationarity of these fluctuations at intervals ranging from minutes to months would drastically alter the relation between some of the stylized empirical facts detected in this way , and the underlying stochastic process . in order to identify the correct model",
    ", one has to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the breaking of time - translation invariance possibly signalled by increments non - stationarity would represent a challenge in itself , being a genuine manifestation of dynamics out of equilibrium , like the aging properties observed in glassy systems @xcite .    in order to detect the possible presence of nonstationarity at certain time - scales for the distribution of the increments",
    ", one would need to have access to many independent realizations of the same process , repeated under similar conditions .",
    "quite remarkably , high - frequency financial time - series offer an opportunity of this kind , in which it is possible to directly sample an ensemble of histories . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proposed that when considering high - frequency eur / usd exchange rate data as recorded during the first three hours of the new york market activity , independent process realizations can tentatively be identified in the daily repetitions of the trading .",
    "this gives the interesting possibility of estimating quantities related to rather than time - averages .",
    "here we profit of this opportunity by showing that a proper analysis of the statistical properties of this ensemble of histories naturally leads to the identification and validation of an original stochatic model of market evolution .",
    "the main idea at the basis of this model is that the scaling properties of the return distribution are sufficient to fully characterize the process in the time range within which they hold .",
    "the same type of model has been recently proposed by some of the present authors to underlie more generally the evolution of financial indices also in cases when only single realizations are available @xcite . in those cases",
    "the application of the model is less direct , and rests on suitable assumptions about the relation between the stationarized empirical information obtainable from the historical series and the underlying driving process .",
    "an interesting feature of the model discussed here and in refs .",
    "@xcite , is that the anomalous scaling of the return pdf enters in its construction on the basis of a property of correlated stability which generalizes the stability of gaussian pdf s under independent random variables summation .",
    "this correlated stability was shown recently to allow the derivation of novel , constructive limit theorems for the pdf of sums of many strongly dependent random variables obeying anomalous scaling @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", the model we present offers a valid alternative to more standard models of finance based on gaussianity and independence . at the same time , the probabilistic framework provided by our modelization presents clear formal analogies and parallels with those standard models .",
    "to address the above points , given the eur / usd exchange rate at time @xmath0 ( @xmath0 measured in tens of minutes ) after 9.00 am new york time , @xmath1 , let us define the return in the interval @xmath2 $ ] as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 . by storing the daily repetitions of the returns from march 2000 to march 2005 , we obtain an ensemble of @xmath6 realizations @xmath7 of the discrete - time stochastic process @xmath8 , with @xmath0 ranging in almost three hours after 9.00 am ny time , i.e. , @xmath9 .",

    "this is a clear indication of return non - stationarity of the underlying process at this time scale .",
    "in addition , an analysis of the nonlinear moments @xmath12 of the total return @xmath13 for @xmath14 , @xmath15 shows that such a nonstationarity is accompanied by an anomalous scaling symmetry .",

    "the representation in terms of mixtures of gaussians often reflects the presence of some heterogeneity or polydispersity in the problem @xcite . in finance ,",
    "the use of convex combinations of gaussians to represent return pdf s is naturally suggested by the fact that return time series show a variety of more or less long intervals characterized by peculiar values of the volatility ( volatility clustering ) .",
    "the idea that @xmath20 can be represented as a mixture of gaussians of varying widths is suggested by the same basic motivations which lead to the introduction of stochastic volatility models in finance @xcite . in the light of the empirical facts",
    ", such a representation of the scaling function in the pdf of the aggregated return naturally suggests an adequate full modelization of the process generating the successive partial returns .",

    "the coefficients @xmath49 in the last equation have to be chosen consistent with the non - stationarity of the elementary returns reported in fig . 1a and with the other statistical properties of the elementary and aggregated returns discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is straightforward to realize that @xmath50 , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes averages with respect to the joint pdf in eq.([eq_joint_0 ] ) , whereas @xmath55 those with respect to the pdf @xmath41 .",

    "however , even for @xmath76 a general @xmath38 implies dependence of the @xmath45 s . to recover the independent case one needs further to choose @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the superposition of independent gaussian processes with different @xmath42 s in eq.([eq_joint_0 ] ) implies an extension of the basic stability properties of the independent gaussian variables case to the dependent case .",

    "we believe that the results obtained in the present report , even if pertaining to a different time - scale ( tens of minutes in place of days ) , constitute an interesting further argument in favor of a general validity of the model .",
    "the peculiar feature of this model is that of focussing on scaling and correlations as basic , closely connected properties of assets evolution .",
    "this was strongly inspired by what has been learnt in the physics of complex systems in the last decades @xcite , where methods like the renormalization group allowed for the first time systematic treatments of these properties @xcite . at the same time , through the original probabilistic parallel mentioned in , our model maintains an interesting direct contact with the mathematics of standard formulations based on brownian motion , of wide use in finance .",
