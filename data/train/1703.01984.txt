    "an integrated reinsurance and investment strategy is commonly employed by an insurer ( cedent ) to increase its underwriting capacity , stabilize underwriting results , protect itself against catastrophic losses , and achieve financial growth .",
    "the study of an insurer s optimal reinsurance - investment strategy has received considerable attention in the literature of actuarial science under a variety of criteria , including minimizing the probability of ruin ( see , for example , promislow and young @xcite , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite , and chen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , maximizing the expected utility of terminal wealth ( see , for example , liu and ma @xcite , bai and guo @xcite , gu et al .",
    "@xcite , and liang and bayraktar @xcite ) , and maximizing expected terminal wealth subject to a constraint on the variance , the so - called _ mean - variance criterion _",
    "( see , for example , buerle @xcite and zeng and li @xcite ) .",
    "the mean - variance criterion is closely related to maximizing expected utility of terminal wealth .",
    "indeed , pratt @xcite observes that the certainty equivalence for a `` small '' random gain @xmath0 under expected utility theory approximately equals @xmath1 in which @xmath2 is the absolute risk aversion of the utility maximizer .",
    "note that maximizing is precisely the mean - variance criterion .",
    "also , under fairly general conditions , optimal insurance is deductible insurance for a risk - averse utility maximizer ( see , for example , arrow @xcite , van heervarden @xcite , and moore and young @xcite ) .",
    "thus , when maximizing ( or solving a related game ) with @xmath0 equal to terminal wealth of an insurance company , we expect that optimal ( or equilibrium ) reinsurance will be deductible , or excess - loss , reinsurance , which we prove below in theorem [ thm:2 ] .",
    "furthermore , because the risk aversion @xmath2 is constant , the deductible is independent of the surplus of the insurer .    under the mean - variance criterion , the reinsurance - investment problem is time - inconsistent in the sense that bellman s optimality principle fails . to tackle the time inconsistency",
    ", we formulate the problem as a non - cooperative game and solve for a subgame perfect nash equilibrium .",
    "specifically , at every time point , the player solves for an _ equilibrium strategy _ by treating the problem as a game against all future versions of himself .",
    "an equilibrium strategy is , thus , time - consistent .",
    "one can trace this approach to strotz @xcite , and it has recently been further developed by bjrk and murgoci @xcite for a general class of objective functions in a markovian framework . due to the importance of time consistency for a rational insurer , the approach has already been applied by many authors to solve for equilibrium strategies in the literature of reinsurance - investment problems ( see , for example , zeng et al .",
    "@xcite and lin and qian @xcite ) .",
    "two types of reinsurance policies are most commonly studied in the literature on equilibrium reinsurance and investment under a mean - variance criterion : ( 1 ) proportional ( quota - share ) reinsurance ( see , for example , zeng and li @xcite , shen and zeng @xcite , and the two references given at the end of the previous paragraph ) and ( 2 ) excess - loss reinsurance ( see , for example , li et al .",
    "@xcite ) . given the rich literature , one question naturally arises which has not received much attention : _ which reinsurance policy yields an equilibrium for an insurer under a mean - variance criterion among reasonable reinsurance policies _ ?",
    "we show that buying excess - loss reinsurance is the unique equilibrium strategy under this criterion .",
    "we model the insurer s basic surplus process , that is , the surplus process without any reinsurance - investment strategy , by a _ spectrally negative lvy process_. the model is widely employed in the context of risk theory in the actuarial literature ( see , for example , yang and zhang @xcite , chiu and yin @xcite , avram et al .",
    "@xcite , and landriault et al .",
    "it is a generalization of many insurance models studied in the context of reinsurance - investment problems , including the brownian motion model ( see , for example , promislow and young @xcite ) , the classical cramr - lundberg model ( see , for example , zeng et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the jump - diffusion model ( see , for example , zeng et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "we prove that ,",
    "when the reinsurance premium is computed according to the expected value premium principle , excess - loss reinsurance is the unique equilibrium strategy for a time - consistent insurer under a mean - variance criterion . as mentioned above , this result is consistent with several in the literature ; specifically , under the expected value premium principle and various objective functions , excess - loss ( re)insurance is optimal , including when maximizing the expected utility of terminal wealth ( see , for example , liang and guo @xcite , zeng and luo @xcite ) and when minimizing the probability of ruin ( see , for example , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite , meng and zhang @xcite , bai et al .",
    "@xcite , and zhou and cai @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we formulate our model and define the equilibrium problem faced by the insurer . in section 3",
    ", we prove that excess - loss reinsurance is the unique equilibrium strategy , and we obtain explicit expressions for the equilibrium reinsurance - investment strategy and the corresponding equilibrium value function . we also discuss two problems closely related to the mean - variance criterion : ( 1 ) maximizing expected exponential utility of terminal wealth , and ( 2 ) maximizing the time-0 mean - variance criterion with commitment . in section 4 , we present some numerical examples to illustrate our findings , and section 5 concludes the paper .",
