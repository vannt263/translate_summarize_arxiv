    "the theory of legendrian knots in the standard contact @xmath0 up to legendrian isotopy is a subject of much recent interest .",
    "beginning in the late 1990 s , two `` non - classical '' invariants of such legendrian knots emerged .",
    "the first is based on the contact homology theory of eliashberg and hofer @xcite , and was couched in combinatorial form by chekanov @xcite .",
    "this invariant is a differential graded algebra that counts certain holomorphic disks in the symplectization of @xmath0 .",
    "the second is the ruling invariant of chekanov and pushkar @xcite , which is derived from the theory of generating functions but has a simple combinatorial definition .",
    "see @xcite for a brief introduction to both invariants .",
    "it seems likely that the information contained in the chekanov ",
    "pushkar ruling invariant is in some way the same as that contained in the linear level of the contact homology dga .",
    "the first link between the two theories was provided by fuchs @xcite , who introduced the concept of a ruling independently of chekanov  pushkar and demonstrated that the existence of a ruling implies the existence of a so - called augmentation of the contact homology dga .",
    "fuchs and ishkhanov @xcite , and , independently , the second author @xcite proved the converse .",
    "in fact , a more general sort of correspondence seems to hold between generating - function invariants and linearized contact homology ; see @xcite for evidence in @xmath1 .    in this paper , we deepen the link between contact homology and rulings by showing that there is a many - to - one correspondence between augmentations and rulings for a plat - position front of a legendrian knot .",
    "an algorithm was given in @xcite for obtaining a ruling of a plat - position front from an augmentation of its dga .",
    "we show that the number of augmentations which yield a particular ruling via the algorithm is determined by the combinatorics of the ruling ( theorem  [ thm ] ) .",
    "this shows , in particular , that the total number of augmentations of the dga of any legendrian knot can be calculated from its ruling invariant ( corollary  [ cor ] ) .",
    "we begin by introducing the terminology necessary to state our main results .",
    "please refer to @xcite ( or any number of other papers ) for the precise definitions and conventions which we will use : contact homology dga , stable tame isomorphism , and algebraic stabilization .",
    "as some geometric conventions and the augmentation and ruling constructions are central to this paper , we will review them in more detail .",
    "a * front diagram * of a legendrian knot @xmath2 in the standard contact space @xmath3 is simply the image of the projection of @xmath2 to the @xmath4 plane .",
    "a front diagram is in * plat position * if all of the left cusps have the same @xmath5 coordinate , all of the right cusps have the same @xmath5 coordinate , and no two crossings have the same @xmath5 coordinate .",
    "for example , the front diagram of the legendrian trefoil in figure  [ fig : trefoil - ex ] is in plat position .",
    "next , we describe some algebraic constructs related to the contact homology dga .",
    "let @xmath2 be a legendrian knot in the standard contact @xmath0 .",
    "its contact homology is the homology of a semifree unital differential graded algebra @xmath6 with coefficients in @xmath7 and grading over @xmath8 . here ,",
    "@xmath9 is the rotation number of @xmath2 , and @xmath10 is generated by the crossings and right cusps of a front diagram @xmath11 of @xmath2 .",
    "of particular interest for this paper are the gradings of the crossings : define a locally constant function @xmath12 from the complement of the cusps in @xmath2 to @xmath8 such that at each cusp , @xmath12 increases by @xmath13 from the lower to the upper strand . near a crossing @xmath14 ,",
    "let @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) be the strand of @xmath11 with more negative ( resp.positive ) slope .",
    "assign the grading @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , all three crossings in the trefoil of figure  [ fig : trefoil - ex ] have degree @xmath18 .",
    "( the other generators of @xmath10 , the right cusps , are all assigned grading @xmath13 . ) the central result of @xcite states that @xmath19 is invariant under legendrian isotopy , up to stable tame isomorphism .",
    "henceforth we assume that we have a integer @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in this case",
    ", it makes sense to discuss whether a crossing of @xmath11 ( a generator of @xmath10 ) has degree divisible by @xmath20 ; we write @xmath22 for the degree of @xmath23 .",
    "one way to extract information from @xmath19 is via augmentations .",
    "a * @xmath24-graded augmentation * of @xmath19 is an algebra map @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "( this last condition states that @xmath30 respects the grading of @xmath10 over @xmath31 , where the base ring @xmath7 is considered to lie in degree @xmath18 . )",
    "two cases are of special interest .",
    "if @xmath32 , then a @xmath13-graded augmentation is also known as an * ungraded augmentation * , on which any generator can be augmented ( i.e. , sent to 1 by @xmath30 ) regardless of grading .",
    "if @xmath33 , and hence @xmath34 , then a @xmath18-graded augmentation is also known as a * @xmath35-graded augmentation * , on which only generators of degree @xmath36 can be augmented .",
    "note that , since @xmath10 is finitely generated as an algebra , any dga has only finitely many @xmath20-graded augmentations .",
    "the number of @xmath20-graded augmentations of @xmath19 is invariant under tame isomorphism , and changes by a power of @xmath37 under algebraic stabilization .",
    "more precisely , an algebraic stabilization of degree @xmath38 adds generators @xmath39 of degree @xmath40 respectively , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it follows that this stabilization leaves the number of @xmath20-graded augmentations unchanged if @xmath43 , and doubles this number if @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath20 is odd or @xmath33 , a normalized count of the number of @xmath20-graded augmentations gives us an invariant of @xmath19 under stable tame isomorphism . let @xmath45 be the number of generators of @xmath46  of degree @xmath47 ; the set @xmath48 is called the * degree distribution * of the dga . set @xmath49 to be the following `` shifted euler characteristic '' of @xmath46 : @xmath50 and @xmath51 if @xmath20 is odd",
    "we can now define the following invariant of legendrian isotopy :    let @xmath2 be a legendrian knot and @xmath20 a divisor of @xmath52 with @xmath33 or @xmath20 odd .",
    "the * normalized @xmath24-graded augmentation number * of @xmath2 , written @xmath53 , is the product of @xmath54 and the number of @xmath20-graded augmentations of @xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the contact homology dga of @xmath2 .",
    "we remark that @xmath55 distinguishes between chekanov s well - known examples of legendrian @xmath56 knots .",
    "note that , when @xmath20 is even and nonzero , it is not possible to define similar normalized augmentation numbers to give an invariant under stable tame isomorphism .",
    "the issue in this case is that one can add an algebraic stabilization in each of degrees @xmath57 , or in each of degrees @xmath58 , and the degree distribution changes the same way in both cases ; however , the number of augmentations doubles in the former case but remains the same in the latter .",
    "we next turn to rulings .",
    "a * * ruling * * of a front is a decomposition of the front into pairs of paths beginning at a left cusp and ending at a right cusp that co - bound disks .",
    "each ruling path is smooth except at cusps and certain crossings called switches . near a switch",
    ", the ruling disks must look like a diagram from the first row of figure  [ fig : crossing - config ] .",
    "if @xmath21 , then the ruling is * @xmath24-graded * if all switches have degree divisible by @xmath20 .    to each ruling @xmath59 of a front @xmath11 of a legendrian knot @xmath2 , we can associate an integer @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of right cusps of @xmath11 ( i.e. , the number of closed curves in @xmath59 ) , and @xmath62 is the number of switches of @xmath59 .",
    "a main result of chekanov and pushkar @xcite is that the multiset @xmath63 which we call the * complete ruling invariant * of @xmath2 , is invariant under legendrian isotopy .",
    "the complete ruling invariant is effective : chekanov @xcite used the complete ruling invariant to distinguish his original @xmath56 examples of legendrian knots that have the same classical invariants .",
    "we conjecture in passing that when @xmath32 ( i.e. , the ungraded case ) , it seems possible that @xmath64 always depends only on the topological type and thurston  bennequin number of @xmath2 .",
    "if this were true , then @xmath65 would provide a topological knot invariant by considering any legendrian @xmath2 in the knot type with maximal thurston  bennequin number .",
    "this is related to , but independent of , the conjecture in @xcite that the ungraded abelianized characteristic algebra is a topological invariant , and the `` irresponsible conjecture '' in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that @xmath66 if and only if the kauffman polynomial bound on the thurston ",
    "bennequin number of @xmath2 is not sharp .",
    "we are now in a position to state our main results .",
    "[ thm ] given a legendrian knot @xmath2 with a diagram @xmath11 in plat position , and an integer @xmath20 with @xmath21 and either @xmath33 or @xmath20 odd , there is a many - to - one correspondence between @xmath20-graded augmentations of the contact homology dga @xmath67 of @xmath11 and @xmath20-graded rulings of @xmath11 , with @xmath68 augmentations corresponding to a ruling @xmath59 .",
    "an example of the correspondence appears in figure  [ fig : trefoil - ex ] .",
    "-graded augmentations and rulings on a legendrian trefoil knot .",
    "large dots represent augmented crossings .",
    "the trefoil pictured has @xmath34 and @xmath69 ; the leftmost ruling has @xmath70 , while the other two have @xmath71 . ]",
    "theorem  [ thm ] has the following immediate consequence .",
    "[ cor ] suppose @xmath72 and @xmath20 is zero or odd .",
    "the normalized @xmath20-graded augmentation number of a legendrian knot @xmath2 can be deduced from the complete ruling invariant : @xmath73    as stated earlier , it is possible that the complete ruling invariant is actually contained somehow in the contact homology dga .",
    "one could hope to associate to each augmentation a fractional power of @xmath37 , so that if a ruling gives @xmath74 augmentations then each of those augmentations is given the fraction @xmath75 .",
    "this would allow us to recover the complete ruling invariant from the augmentations of the dga .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm ] rests on an algorithm described in @xcite that produces a ruling from an augmentation . after setting notation , we will describe this algorithm , use it to define the many - to - one correspondence in the theorem , and finally count the number of augmentations that correspond to each ruling in terms of the degree distribution of the contact homology dga .",
    "let @xmath2 be a legendrian knot with plat diagram @xmath11 and a @xmath20-graded ruling @xmath59 .",
    "near a crossing , call the two ruling paths that are incident to the crossing * crossing paths * and call the ruling paths that are paired with the crossing paths * companion paths*. at a crossing of @xmath11 whose grading is not divisible by @xmath20 , the ruling simply passes through the crossing with no switch .",
    "we can use the ruling @xmath59 to partition the crossings of @xmath11 with grading divisible by @xmath20 into three types :    switches : :    the ruling disks are nested or disjoint on both sides of the crossing .",
    "see the first line of figure  [ fig : crossing - config ] .",
    "departures : :    moving left - to - right , the ruling disks pass from nested or disjoint to    interlaced . see the second line of figure  [ fig : crossing - config ] .",
    "returns : :    moving left - to - right , the ruling disks pass from interlaced to nested    or disjoint .",
    "see the third line of figure  [ fig : crossing - config ] .",
    "the correspondence in theorem  [ thm ] is derived from the procedure implicitly described in @xcite for producing a ruling on a plat diagram from an augmentation @xmath30 .",
    "we recall the procedure here .",
    "label the crossings from left to right by @xmath76 .",
    "the construction begins at the left cusps , where any ruling must pair paths incident to the same cusp .",
    "the next step is to extend the ruling over the crossings from left to right , one crossing at a time . the extension procedure uses a succession of `` virtual augmentations '' , @xmath20-graded algebra maps @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is defined after the ruling has been extended over @xmath80 .",
    "the extension of the ruling over @xmath80 depends on the configuration of the ruling disks to the left of @xmath80 and on @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath82 is not divisible by @xmath20 , then the ruling extends without switching .",
    "otherwise , the ruling extends according to the following instructions :    * if the ruling disks are nested or disjoint to the left of @xmath80 and @xmath83 , then extend the ruling over the crossing as a switch . *",
    "if the ruling disks are nested or disjoint to the left of @xmath80 and @xmath84 , then extend the ruling over the crossing as a departure .",
    "* otherwise  i.e. , if the ruling disks are interlaced to the left of @xmath80  then extend the ruling over the crossing as a return .    once the ruling has been extended over @xmath80",
    ", we define the virtual augmentation @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath85 , or if the ruling is extended over @xmath80 as in configuration ( r1 ) , then set @xmath86 .",
    "for the other configurations , set @xmath87 for @xmath88 ; we now inductively define @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "suppose that @xmath91 has been defined for @xmath92 .",
    "the value of @xmath89 depends on a count of a special set of embeddings of the @xmath37-disk into the diagram , up to smooth reparametrization .",
    "if the number of these disks is odd , then @xmath93 ; the two virtual augmentations agree on @xmath94 otherwise .",
    "the image of the boundary of the disks leaves @xmath94 on the upper left strand , travel leftwards ( possibly with convex corners at vertices with @xmath95 ) to the top of a vertical line segment that joins two strands of the diagram and lies just to the right of @xmath80 .",
    "the boundary then traverses this segment and travels rightwards ( again with possible convex corners where @xmath95 ) back to @xmath94 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : special - disk ] . in the case",
    "where the ruling has been extended over @xmath80 in configurations ( r2 ) or ( r3 ) , the vertical segment above must join the companion strands . in the case of configuration ( s1 )",
    ", the vertical segment joins the crossing strands . in the case of configuration ( s2 ) , first perform the entire inductive procedure using disks with vertical segments that join the companion strands , to obtain a virtual augmentation @xmath96 from @xmath97 ; then repeat the procedure with vertical segments that join the crossing strands , to obtain the virtual augmentation @xmath79 from @xmath96 . for configuration ( s3 ) , do the same thing in the opposite order .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that this procedure determines a genuine ruling .     on @xmath94 .",
    "the vertical segment lies to the right of @xmath80 and joins either the crossing strands or the companion strands ; in the latter case , some other strands may cross the vertical segment .",
    "the corners on the top and bottom lie at crossings where @xmath95.,height=76 ]    with the algorithm now in hand , we may begin the proof of the correspondence between augmentations and rulings .",
    "the algorithm sends an augmentation to a ruling ; the question is which augmentations get sent to the same ruling .",
    "the answer is given by the following :    [ lem1 ] if a @xmath20-graded ruling of a plat diagram @xmath11 has @xmath98 returns , then the number of @xmath20-graded augmentations corresponding to it is @xmath99 if @xmath100 , and @xmath101 if @xmath32 .",
    "the algorithm given above for obtaining a ruling @xmath59 from an augmentation @xmath30 also gives a `` final '' virtual augmentation @xmath102 .",
    "different augmentations result in different final virtual augmentations ; simply consider the leftmost crossing @xmath94 at which the augmentations differ .",
    "it is also clear from the algorithm that @xmath102 augments the switches of @xmath59 , some subset of the returns of @xmath59 , and no other crossings .",
    "we claim that any virtual augmentation which augments only the switches and some subset of the returns of @xmath59 , for some ruling @xmath59 , is the final virtual augmentation for some augmentation of the diagram .",
    "indeed , the argument in @xcite leading to the algorithm shows that such a virtual augmentation @xmath103 corresponds to an honest augmentation on the dga @xmath104 for a different ( `` dipped '' ) diagram for the knot .",
    "the algorithm determines a stable tame isomorphism between the dga @xmath19 for @xmath11 and @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the augmentation on @xmath104 yields an augmentation @xmath30 on a stabilization of @xmath19 and hence , by restriction , on @xmath19 itself .",
    "then @xmath103 is the final virtual augmentation for @xmath30 , proving the claim .",
    "now given a @xmath20-graded ruling @xmath59 , the number of virtual augmentations augmenting only its switches and some of its returns is clearly @xmath99 when @xmath106 , and @xmath101 when @xmath32 , since in the latter case any subset of the right cusps , which have degree @xmath13 , can be augmented . by the preceding argument ,",
    "this is also the number of augmentations corresponding to @xmath59 .        as before ,",
    "let @xmath98 be the number of returns of a @xmath20-graded ruling @xmath59 ; also , let @xmath110 and @xmath111 denote the number of switches and departures , respectively ( by definition , this only counts crossings of degree divisible by @xmath20 ) .",
    "consider a vertical line which intersects the plat diagram generically ( i.e. , it does not pass through a crossing or cusp ) .",
    "since there are @xmath61 right cusps , any such line intersects the diagram in @xmath112 points , ordered from top to bottom , and the ruling determines a pairing of these points .",
    "in addition , each point @xmath113 carries a maslov index @xmath114 given by the maslov index of its strand ( see @xcite or @xcite for the definition of maslov index ) , and the maslov indices of paired points differ by @xmath13 .",
    "say that two pairs of points are * interlaced * if we encounter the pairs alternately as we move from top to bottom ; that is , they appear from top to bottom as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 denotes one pair of companion strands and @xmath117 denotes the other . to any generic vertical line we associate a number called the * interlacing number*. we will see that as we move the vertical line from left to right , beginning just after the left cusps and ending just before the right cusps , then the interlacing number begins and ends at @xmath18 , and changes by @xmath118 when passing through each crossing ; counting these changes yields the lemma .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath32 , i.e. , the ungraded case .",
    "here we define the interlacing number of a vertical line to be the number of interlaced pairs on it .",
    "as we sweep the vertical line from left to right , the interlacing number clearly begins and ends at @xmath18 , is unchanged at each switch , increases by @xmath13 at each departure , and decreases by @xmath13 at each return .",
    "thus @xmath119 ; the lemma follows from the fact that @xmath120 .",
    "next consider the case @xmath33 , i.e. , the @xmath35-graded case .",
    "for @xmath121 , let @xmath122 be the number of crossings of @xmath11 of degree @xmath123 , and note that , for @xmath45 defined as in section  [ sec : intro ] , we have @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 ; also , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the lemma now reduces to proving that @xmath129    to two interlaced pairs @xmath115 we associate a sign : @xmath130 define the interlacing number of a vertical line to be the sum over all interlaced pairs of this sign . again ,",
    "if we move the vertical line from left to right , the interlacing number begins and ends at @xmath18 , and changes only when the line passes through a non - switch crossing .",
    "consider any crossing @xmath131 besides a switch .",
    "we claim that the interlacing number changes at @xmath131 by @xmath118 , and that each crossing contributes the appropriate sign to obtain ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "if we ignore degree , @xmath131 looks like one of ( d * ) or ( r * ) from figure  [ fig : crossing - config ] . there is a one - to - one correspondence between interlaced pairs as for switches , except for one extra interlaced pair on the right of @xmath131 , in the case of ( d * ) , or on the left , in the case of ( r * ) .",
    "label this interlaced pair by @xmath115 . as we pass through @xmath131 , the interlacing number changes by @xmath132 for ( d * ) and @xmath133 for ( r * ) .",
    "recall from @xcite or @xcite that the degree @xmath134 of a crossing is the difference of the maslov indices of the crossing strands , more precisely @xmath135 where @xmath23 lies above @xmath136 to the left of the crossing .",
    "note also that for the interlaced pair @xmath115 as above , we have @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "it follows that the degree of a crossing that looks like ( d1 ) is @xmath139 ; ( d2 ) and ( d3 ) , @xmath140 ; ( r1 ) , @xmath141 ; ( r2 ) and ( r3 ) , @xmath142 .",
