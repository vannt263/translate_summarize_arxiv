    "the constellation x  ray mission is a high throughput x - ray facility emphasizing observations at high spectral resolution ( e/@xmath0=3003000 ) while covering a broad energy bandpass ( 0.2540 kev ) .",
    "constellation - x will provide a factor of nearly 100 increase in sensitivity over current high resolution x - ray spectroscopy missions .",
    "the large collecting area is achieved with a design utilizing several mirror modules , each with its own detector system .",
    "each ( or a few ) science unit will fly on a separate spacecraft .",
    "two telescopes will be on  board : the low  energy spectroscopy x - ray telescope ( sxt ) , operating simultaneously with a 2 ev resolution calorimeter and a set of reflection gratings ; a high  energy system ( hxt ) , that will be the first focusing telescope system operating at several tens of kev , where the energy density of the xrb peaks ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the baseline mission characteristics are :    * effective area : 15000 ( 6000 , 1500 ) @xmath1 at 1 ( 6.4 , 40 ) kev * angular resolution : 15  hpd from 0.25 to 10 kev ; 1 hpd at 40 kev * band pass : 0.25 to 40 kev    more information can be found at :  http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/",
    "to evaluate the fraction of hard xrb resolved by the hxt onboard constellation - x , we first developed a synthesis model based on the standard assumption that the xrb is mostly made by a combination of type 1 and 2 agn ( setti & woltjer 1989 ; comastri et al .",

    "we are now able to predict the fraction of the cosmic xrb which can be resolved by constellation  x in the 1040 kev energy range .",
    "our estimate is based on the baseline spatial resolution , i.e. 1 hpd , which is a rather conservative value .",
