    "as previously suggested @xcite , superfluid  provides a suitable working medium for the detection of low energy recoil interactions .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown the possibility to use a superfluid  cell at ultra low temperatures ( t@xmath1100 @xmath2k ) . the primary device consisted of a small copper cubic box ( v@xmath1 0.125 @xmath3 ) filled with .",
    "it is immersed in a larger volume containing liquid  and thin plates of copper nuclear - cooling refrigerant , see fig . [",
    "fig : design ] .",
    "two vibrating wires are placed inside the cell , forming a lancaster type bolometer@xcite .",
    "a small hole on one of the box walls connects the box to the main  volume , thus allowing the diffusion of the thermal excitations of the  generated by the energy deposited in the bolometer by the interacting particle . + this high sensitivity device is used as follows : the incoming particle deposits an amount of energy in the cell , which is converted into  quasiparticles .",
    "these are detected by their damping effect on the vibrating wire .",
    "it must be pointed out that the size of the hole governs the relaxing time ( quasiparticles escape time ) and the q factor of the resonator governs the rising time , see figure [ fig : signal ] .",
    "the present device has a rather high q factor ( q @xmath4 ) , giving a rising time of the order of one second .",
    "although the primary experiment was still rudimentary , it has allowed to detect signals down to a threshold of 1 kev @xcite .",
    "many ideas are under study to improve the sensitivity of such a cell .",
    "recently , the fabrication of micromechanical silicon resonators has been reported @xcite and the possibility to use such wires at ultra - low temperatures is under study .",
    "+ the aim of the present article is to show that , by using a large number of these cells , a high granularity superfluid  detector could be used for direct dark matter ( dm ) search - ray  shieldings . ] . for this purpose",
    "we have evaluated , by simulation of different kind of background events , the rejection coefficients that may be achieved with such a device .",
    "as other direct dm search detectors ( edelweiss@xcite , cresst@xcite , cuore@xcite ) , the identification of wimps ( @xmath5 ) ) , the lightest supersymmetric particle , as the particle making up the bulk of galactic cold dm . ] may be obtained by detecting their elastic scaterring on a nucleus of a sensitive medium . in the case of , the @xmath5",
    "is expected to transfer @xcite up to 6 kev .",
    "the maximum  recoil energy is given by :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the mass of the  nucleus , @xmath8 the mass of the @xmath5  and @xmath9 is the relative speed of the @xmath5  . assuming that @xmath10 , as the accelerator experiments claim , this relation yields to @xmath11 , which gives for @xmath12 , a maximum recoil energy of @xmath13 6 kev .",
    "+ hence , in order to evaluate the expected background for such a detection , it is necessary to know the proportion of events releasing less than 6 kev in the  cell .",
    "the main background components for direct dm search are : thermal and fast neutrons , muons and gamma rays .      the total cross - section interaction for a neutron in  ranges from @xmath14 barns , for low energy neutrons(e@xmath15 1 ev ) , down to @xmath16 barn for 1 mev neutrons .",
    "the main processes are : elastic scattering which starts being predominant above 600 kev , and neutron capture : ( n , p )  , which is largely predominant for low energy neutrons ( @xmath17 kev ) :    n+ @xmath18he @xmath19 p+@xmath18h + 764 kev    the energy released by the neutron capture is shared by the recoil ions : the tritium @xmath18h with kinetic energy 191 kev and the proton with kinetic energy 573 kev .",
    "the range @xcite for these two particles is fairly short : typically 12 @xmath2 m for tritium and 67 @xmath2 m for proton ; consequently neutrons undergoing capture in  are expected to produce 764 kev within the cell , thus being clearly separated from the expected @xmath5  signal ( e @xmath20 6kev ) .",
    "the tritium produced by neutron capture will eventually decay with a half - life of 12 years by @xmath21-decay with an end - point electron spectrum at 18 kev .",
    "it means that the number of neutrons capture per cell must be counted to estimate the contribution of this kind of events on the false @xmath5  rate .",
    "+ the capture cross - section decreases with increasing neutron kinetic energy , but on the other hand , the energy released in the  cell by the elastic scattering is getting larger , thus diminishing the probability to leave less than 6 kev . from this , it is clear that the worst case will be 8 kev neutrons for which the capture process is less predominant , and the energy left by ( n , n ) interaction is always less or equal to 6 kev .",
    "+ in order to reduce contamination from neutron background , the idea is either to have a correlation among the cells , which means a large number of  cells , or to have a cell large enough for the neutron to be slowed down until it is captured .      as  presents the property to have a low photoelectric cross - section",
    ", compton scaterring is largely predominant between 100 kev and 10 mev ( for 100 kev @xmath0-rays  : @xmath22 10 ) .",
    "consequently , the strategy to separate a @xmath5  event from a @xmath0-ray event is two fold : either the cell is large enough for the @xmath0-ray to undergo multi - compton scattering within one cell , or the number of cells in the matrix is large enough so that there could be an interaction in more than one cell ( this will be referred to as a correlated event or a multi - cell event )",
    ". it will be shown , in the next section , that having a relatively large cell in a large matrix presents the best rejection against @xmath0-ray events .",
    "+ the copper used to build the cells must be produced by a controlled procedure with respect to the radioactive contaminations .",
    "nevertheless , the interaction of @xmath0-rays  with the copper will produce x - rays and scaterred electrons by compton and photo - electric interactions .",
    "these kind of interactions have been taken into account in our simulations and they enhance the correlation among the different cells fired by an incoming @xmath0-ray  .",
    "the aim of this simulation is to evaluate the capability of a superfluid  matrix to reject background events , by taking advantage both on correlation among the cells ( multi - cell events ) and energy loss measurement .",
    "the simulation has been done with a complete monte - carlo simulation using geant3.21 @xcite package and in particular the gcalor - micap(1.04/10 ) @xcite package for slow neutrons .",
    "the simulated detector consists of a cube containing a variable number of cubic  cells , as it can be seen on figure [ fig:10kev ] .",
    "it is immersed in a large volume containing  ( @xmath23=0.08 @xmath24 ) .",
    "each cell is surrounded by a thin copper layer and it is separated from the others by a gap of 2 @xmath25 ( filled with ) . the events are generated in a direction perpendicular to one of the matrix faces .",
    "the number of events per simulation is of the order of 200@xmath26 .",
    "the idea is to find the best matrix design ( number of cubic cells and the size of each cell ) for which the rejection power , taking into account the correlation among the cells and the energy loss measurement , is the highest .    as said previously , a typical @xmath5",
    "is expected to release less than 6 kev in the  cell . as the elastic cross - section between a @xmath5  and  is fairly small ( @xmath27 )",
    ", a @xmath5  event is expected to be characterized by a single - cell event , with equal probability among all the cells of the matrix .",
    "+ consequently , the rejection against background events will be achieved by choosing only events having the following characteristics :    only one cell fired ( single - cell event ) .",
    "the quality parameter related to this selection will be defined below as c@xmath28 .",
    "energy measurement in this cell below 6 kev and above a threshold of 0.5 kev ( quality parameter : r@xmath29 ) .",
    "an additional constraint can be imposed : the fired cell is in the inner part of the matrix ( quality parameter : c@xmath30 ) .",
    "this condition , which considers the outermost cell layer as a veto , will allow to reject low energy neutrons interacting elastically , as shown below .",
    "let n be the number of events giving a signal in the matrix ( any energy , any number of cells ) , n@xmath31 the number of single - cell events ( any energy ) and n@xmath32 the number of single - cell events with an energy measurement below 6 kev .",
    "m@xmath31 and m@xmath32 will be referred with the same meaning as n@xmath31 and n@xmath32 , but for events firing a cell in the inner part of the detector ( out of the veto ) .",
    "+ then , we may define the following parameters as :    c@xmath28@xmath33 ; the correlation coefficient ( proportion of single - cell events ) .",
    "r@xmath34 ; the rejection by energy measurement .",
    "c@xmath35 ; the veto coefficient .",
    "r@xmath36 ; the intrinsic rejection .",
    "in order to define the optimimum matrix design ( number of cubic cells and size of the cells ) , a complete simulation has been done .",
    "the results concerning three types of background are presented : 10 kev neutrons , 1 mev neutrons and 2.6 mev @xmath0-rays . for each sample ,",
    "the four parameters defined above are evaluated in various configurations : cell size of 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.5 and 5.0 @xmath37 and matrix containing @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) cells .",
    "the best design will be the one for which c@xmath28 is the lowest ( thus minimizing the proportion of single - cell background events ) and r@xmath29 is the highest ( meaning a low proportion of background events with an energy measurement below 6 kev ) .      due to the fact that it is a simulation without any constraint on the detector volume , the correlation coefficient depends strongly on the size of the matrix , with a small dependence on the cell size , as shown on figure [ fig : cgeo26 m ] .",
    "the best correlation is obtained for 8000 cells of size 2.5 @xmath37 ( c@xmath43 ) . in order to keep a reasonable number of cells",
    ", it can be noticed that a matrix of same volume ( 1000 cells of 5.0 @xmath37 side ) presents also a good correlation ( c@xmath44 ) .",
    "a multi - cell event can either be a multi - compton event , or a single - compton event for which the electron is escaping the cell and firing a neighbouring cell .",
    "this last process depends mainly on the cell size and explains the fact that c@xmath28 remains constant for cell sides larger than 1 @xmath37 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cgeo26 m ] .",
    "+ it has been found that the energy rejection ( r@xmath29 ) depends mainly on the size of the cell . for a large cell ( 5 @xmath37 side ) , a rejection r@xmath45",
    "is obtained , allowing to reject 98 % of the 2.6 mev @xmath0-rays . the total rejection ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rejall ] ) , which take into account the correlation and energy selection , together with veto selection and interaction probability , is r@xmath1700 for 1000 cells of size 5.0 @xmath37 ( for 2.6 mev @xmath0-rays  ) .",
    "+ consequently , for @xmath0-ray  background rejection purpose , a cell of 5.0 @xmath37 side presents the best energy rejection and a matrix of 1000 cells of this size allows to obtain a good correlation coefficient . in section",
    "[ gamrejsec ] , the rejection of such a matrix as a function of the @xmath0-ray  energy will be presented .",
    "figures [ fig : cgeon10 ] and [ fig : cenern10 ] present the correlation coefficient ( c@xmath28 ) and the energy rejection ( r@xmath29 ) as a function of the cell size , for different matrix sizes and an incident neutron energy of 10 kev .",
    "the correlation coefficient depends both on the size of the cell and of the matrix , since the neutron capture is the predominant process at this energy .",
    "the best correlation is obtained for 8000 cells of size 2.5 @xmath37 ( c@xmath46 ) , but a larger cell ( 5 @xmath37 side ) , with only 1000 cells presents also a similar correlation ( c@xmath47 ) . the energy rejection ( r@xmath29 )",
    "depends not only on the size of the cell , but also on the size of the matrix . the best rejection ( r@xmath48 )",
    "is achieved for a large cell ( 5 @xmath37 side ) and a large matrix ( 1000 cells ) .",
    "the total rejection , shown on fig.[fig : rejall ] , is r@xmath180 for 1000 cells of 5 @xmath37 side , meaning that only 1.25 % of the incoming 10 kev neutrons may simulate a @xmath5  event .",
    "it must be pointed out that 10 kev represent the worst case for rejection purpose , as it can be seen on figure [ fig : rejall ] .",
    "figures [ fig : cgeon1 ] and [ fig : cenern1 ] show the correlation coefficient ( c@xmath28 ) and the energy rejection ( r@xmath29 ) as a function of the cell size , for different matrix sizes and an incident neutron energy of 1 mev . as well as for low energy neutrons ,",
    "the correlation coefficient depends on the matrix and cell sizes .",
    "a correlation of @xmath13 65 % is achieved for a large  volume ( 1000 cells of 5 @xmath37 or 8000 cells of 2.5 @xmath37 ) .",
    "a large matrix of big cells ( 1000 cells of 5 @xmath37 ) allows to obtain a rather large energy rejection ( r@xmath49 ) , leading to a total rejection of the order of 1000 ( see fig.[fig : rejall ] ) , meaning that 99.9% of 1 mev neutrons arriving on the  matrix may be discriminated from a @xmath5  event .",
    "+ for these three particle samples , the simulation has shown that a large cell ( 125 @xmath50 ) allows to obtain a large energy rejection , and a large matrix ( 1000 cells or more ) allows to have a good correlation among cells , thus rejecting efficiently @xmath0-rays  and neutrons of kinetic energy e@xmath11 mev .",
    "hence , for background rejection consideration the optimum configuration is a matrix of 1000 cells of 5 @xmath37 side .",
    "as shown previously , a matrix of @xmath41 large cells ( 125 @xmath51 each ) presents the best rejection power , both for neutrons and @xmath0-rays .",
    "this section presents the various coefficients , as defined in section [ sec : intera ] , as a function of the energy of the incoming particle .",
    "+      figure [ fig : coeffgam ] shows the correlation coefficient , the veto coefficient , the energy rejection and the total rejection as a function of the @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "a good correlation is achieved for high energy @xmath0-rays ( @xmath521 mev ) , whereas low energy @xmath0-rays are mainly rejected by the veto .",
    "in fact , 80 kev x - rays undergo photoelectric effect in the copper layer ( @xmath53barn ) surrounding the cell ; the scaterred electrons may escape the copper layer and leave a few kev in the cell .",
    "this will mainly happen in the outermost cells .",
    "+ figure [ fig : rejall ] presents the total rejection as a function of the @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "it can be concluded that an  matrix provides a rejection ranging between 10 and 1000 , depending on the @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "it must be pointed out that this is the rejection power of the matrix itself .",
    "for instance , 90% of x - rays will be rejected by the matrix , but the flux of such particles will be reduced substantially by an inner and outer copper shielding .",
    "figure [ fig : coeffneut ] presents the four matrix parameters as a function of the neutron energy .",
    "a correlation better than 70 % is achieved for neutrons of energy greater than 100 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coeffneut ] , upper left ) , while low energy neutrons are mainly rejected by the veto .",
    "indeed , 60 % of 10 kev neutrons are captured in the first layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coeffneut ] , upper right ) .",
    "the energy measurement constitute an efficient selection for low energy neutron ( r@xmath54 100 for 1 kev neutrons ) and for fast neutrons ( r@xmath54 1000 for 1 mev neutrons ) .",
    "as expected 10 kev neutrons have the worst energy rejection ( r@xmath54 15 ) .",
    "+ the total rejection ( ratio between number of incoming particles and number of false @xmath5  events ) , shown on figure [ fig : rejall ] , indicates that only one 1 kev neutron out of 2000 may simulate a @xmath5  event .",
    "the rejection falls down to 75 for 10 kev neutrons ( mainly rejected by the veto ) and is of the order of 1000 for 1 mev neutrons .",
    "it must be pointed out that the evaluated rejection is for a `` naked matrix '' , i.e. without taking into account any lead or paraffin shielding or any separation between electron and ion recoils .",
    "it represents the capability of the  matrix to reject background events by means of energy loss measurements and correlation considerations . as a conclusion",
    ", it can be said that the  matrix presents a rejection power ranging between 75 and 2000 for neutrons , and between 10 and 800 for @xmath0-rays , depending on their kinetic energies .      as neutrons recoiling off nuclei",
    "may easily simulate a @xmath5  event , it is crucial to evaluate the neutron - induced false event rate .",
    "+ in contrast to most dm detectors , mache3 may be sensitive to rather low energy neutrons , and its response depends strongly on their kinetic energies . for this purpose , a simulation of a paraffin neutron shielding has been done , in order to evaluate the expected neutron spectrum trough this shielding .",
    "+ the simulated device is a large ( @xmath55 ) paraffin block ( @xmath56=0.95 g.@xmath57 ) with a width of 30 @xmath37 . in order to be conservative , as well as keeping the calculation times short ,",
    "we choose to generate the events in a direction perpendicular to the face of the paraffin block and considering that all neutrons crossing the block are supposed to enter the matrix volume .",
    "+ a benchmark study has been done , to compare mcnp calculation code@xcite and geant3.21 .",
    "we found that these two codes give similar results , except for thermal neutrons ( below 1 ev ) for which geant underevaluate the flux .",
    "again , to be conservative , we choose the one giving the highest flux ( mcnp ) .",
    "+ we have used the measured neutron spectrum @xcite in laboratoire souterrain de modane ( lsm ) , between 2 and 6 mev , , will be highly suppressed by the 30 @xmath37 paraffin shielding ] with an integrated flux of @xmath58 .",
    "we found an overall neutron flux through the shielding of 5.1@xmath59 , with the neutron kinetic energy ranging between @xmath60 ev and 6 mev ( see the upper curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : neutfalse ] ) .",
    "+ using this flux and the expected rejection factor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rejall ] ) , we evaluated the false @xmath5  rate induced by neutron background , see fig .",
    "[ fig : neutfalse ] . we found a rate of @xmath130.1 false event per day through the 1.5@xmath61 surface detector ( 1000 cells of 125 @xmath51 ) .",
    "even with such a conservative approach , this contamination is much lower than the expected @xmath5  rate ( of the order of @xmath131 day@xmath62 in a detector of this size @xcite ) .",
    "the muon background flux in an underground laboratory ( gran sasso ) has been measured by @xcite .",
    "they found a mean flux of @xmath63 for an average kinetic energy @xmath64@xmath65@xmath66=200 gev .",
    "+ an evaluation of the @xmath2-induced event rate has been done . the same procedure as above",
    "( see section [ simumatrix ] ) has been used , without paraffin shielding ; i.e. the events are generated in a direction perpendicular to one of the matrix faces .",
    "this is a conservative approach because the worst case is in which muons are passing in between 2 cell layers .",
    "as expected , most of the @xmath2-events interact in all the crossed cells ( 75% interact in 10 cells , with an average energy left of @xmath13 1 mev ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient is c@xmath67 ( meaning 97.9@xmath68 of @xmath2-events are rejected ) , with an energy rejection r@xmath69 , leading to an overall rejection of r@xmath70 .",
    "this lead to a @xmath2-induced false @xmath5  rate of the order of 0.0095 day@xmath62m@xmath71 , which is more than two orders of magnitude below the expected @xmath5  rate .",
    "the layers may be shifted , thus allowing a much higher rejection against muon background events .",
    "as shown in section [ gamrejsec ] , a high granularity superfluid  detector provides an intrinsic rejection ranging between 10 and 800 for @xmath0-rays , depending on their kinetic energies .",
    "this selection , based on the correlation among the cells and energy loss measurement , may be improved by adding a discrimination between recoils and electrons .",
    "different experimental approaches should be tested .",
    "a complete study of an inner and outer cryostat shielding is also needed , as well as an evaluation of natural radioactivity of materials .",
    "nevertheless , this simulation indicates that an important intrinsic rejection can be achieved .",
    "in this prospective paper , we have demonstrate that a large matrix ( @xmath13 1000 cells ) of large cells ( 125 @xmath51 ) is the preferred design for a superfluid  detector searching for dm , as far as background rejection is concerned .",
    "an experimental work needs to be done to demonstrate the possibility to use such a large volume of superfluid @xmath72-b at ultra - low temperatures .",
    "this work has evaluated the background rejection of a high granularity superfluid  detector for a large range of kinetic energies , both for neutrons and @xmath0-rays .",
    "it has been shown that , by means of correlation among the cells and energy loss measurement , a high rejection may be obtained for @xmath0-ray , neutron and muon background . using the measured muon and neutron flux in an underground laboratory ,",
    "we have evaluated the contamination to be one order of magnitude ( two orders for muons ) less than the expected @xmath5  rate . for background rejection purpose ,",
    "the main advantage of a superfluid  detector is to present a high rejection against neutron background , mainly because of the high capture cross - section at low energy . as neutrons interact _ a priori _ like @xmath5 , they are the ultimate background noise for dm detectors . + * acknowledgements * + the authors are grateful to d. kerdraon and l. perrot for the help concerning the use of mcnp calculation code , and also f. ohlsson - malek for the fruitful discussions on the geant code",
