    "a large number of microscopic models have been proposed over the years to represent the microstructure of porous media @xcite .",
    "microscopic models do not reproduce the exact microstructure of the medium at hand , but are based on the idea that the experimental sample is a representative realization drawn from a statistical ensemble of similar microstructures .",

    "local porosity theory is used in this paper to distinguish quantitatively various models for fontainebleau sandstone . more precisely , the objective of this work is to give a quantitative comparison of four microstructures .",
    "one of them is an experimental sample of fontainebleau sandstone , while three of the microstructures are synthetic samples from computer simulation models for fontainebleau sandstone .",
    "one of the models is a sedimentation and diagenesis model that tries to mimick the formation of sandstone through deposition and cementation of spherical grains .",
    "two purely stochastic models generate random realizations of microstructures with prescribed porosity and correlation function .",

    "the sandstone modelling is carried out in three main steps : grain sedimentation , compaction and diagenesis . here",

    "the grain size distribution is measured using an erosion - dilation algorithm .",
    "spherical grains with random diameters chosen from the grain size distribution are dropped onto the grain bed and relaxed into a potential energy minimum .",
    "the sedimentation environment may be low - energy ( local minimum ) or high - energy ( global minimum ) .",
    "compaction reduces the bulk volume ( and porosity ) in response to vertical stress from the overburden .",
    "it is modelled here as a linear process in which the vertical coordinate of every sandgrain is shifted vertically downwards by an amount proportional to the original vertical position .",
    "the proportionality constant is called the compaction factor . its value for our fontainebleau sandstone",
    "is estimated to be @xmath82 from thin section analysis .",
    "in the diagenesis part only a subset of known diagenetical processes are simulated , namely quartz cement overgrowth and precipitation of authigenic clay on the free surface . quartz cement overgrowth is modeled by radially enlarging each grain .",

    "the method of gaussian field reconstruction is well documented in the literature @xcite , and we shall only make a few remarks that the reader may find of interest when implementing the method .    given the reference correlation function @xmath95 and porosity @xmath81 of the experimental sample the three main steps of constructing the sample @xmath96 with correlation function @xmath97 are as follows :    1 .",
    "a standard gaussian field @xmath98 is generated which consists of statistically independent gaussian random variables @xmath99 at each lattice point @xmath41 .",

    "the correlated field @xmath100 is then passed through a nonlinear discretization filter which produces the reconstructed sample @xmath96 .",
    "details of these three main steps are documented in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , in these traditional methods the process described in step [ l2 ] is computationally difficult because it requires the solution of a very large set of non - linear equations .",
    "we have followed an alternate and computationally more efficient method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which uses fourier transforms . for the sake of completeness",
    "we briefly describe this .",
    "later we shall discuss some of the difficulties experienced while implementing this .    in the fourier",
    "transform method the linear filter in step [ l2 ] is defined in fourier space through @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the sidelength of a cubic sample , @xmath103 is the normalisation factor , and @xmath104 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath98 . similarly @xmath105 is the fourier transform of @xmath100 , and @xmath106 is the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath107 has to be computed by an inverse process from the correlation function @xmath95 and porosity of the experimental reference ( details in @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that the gaussian field reconstruction requires a large separation @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the correlation length of the experimental reference , and @xmath25 is the number of sites .",
    "@xmath109 is defined as the length such that @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "if the condition @xmath108 is violated then step [ l2 ] of the reconstruction fails in the sense that the correlated gaussian field @xmath100 does not have zero mean and unit variance .",
    "in such a situation the filter @xmath106 will differ from the fourier transform of the correlation function of the @xmath100 .",
    "it is also difficult to calculate @xmath112 accurately near @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a discrepancy at small @xmath114 between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the problem can be overcome by choosing large @xmath117 as we verified in @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "however , in @xmath1 very large @xmath117 also demands prohibitively large memory . in earlier work @xcite",
    "the correlation function @xmath95 was sampled down to a lower resolution , and the reconstruction algorithm then proceeded with such a rescaled correlation function .",
    "this leads to a reconstructed sample @xmath96 which also has a lower resolution .",
    "such reconstructions have lower average connectivity compared to the original model @xcite because we intend a quantitative comparison with the microstructure of @xmath120 it is necessary to retain the same level of resolution .",
    "hence we use throughout this article the original correlation function @xmath95 without subsampling .",
    "because @xmath116 is nearly @xmath71 for @xmath121 we have truncated @xmath116 at @xmath122 to save computer time .",
    "the final configuration @xmath96 with @xmath123 generated by gaussian filtering reconstruction that is used in the comparison to experiment is displayed in figure [ smplc ] .",
    "the simulated annealing ( sa ) reconstruction model is a second method to generate a threedimensional random microstructure with prescribed porosity and correlation function .",
    "a simplified implementation was recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we follow their algorithm here .",
    "the method generates a configuration @xmath124 by minimizing the deviations between @xmath125 and a predefined reference function @xmath93 .",
    "of course in our case we have again the fontainebleau sandstone as reference , i.e. @xmath94 .    the reconstruction is performed on a cubic lattice with side length @xmath102 and lattice spacing @xmath14 .",
    "the lattice is initialized randomly with @xmath71 s and @xmath126 s such that the volume fraction of @xmath71 s equals @xmath81 .",
    "this porosity is preserved throughout the simulation .",
    "for the sake of numerical efficiency the autocorrelation function is evaluated in a simplified form using @xcite @xmath127{0mm}{2ex}_{\\mmm}}({\\mathbf r } )    \\left (      { \\chi\\rule[-1ex]{0mm}{2ex}_{\\mmm}}({\\mathbf r}+r{\\mathbf e}_1 ) +      { \\chi\\rule[-1ex]{0mm}{2ex}_{\\mmm}}({\\mathbf r}+r{\\mathbf e}_2 ) +      { \\chi\\rule[-1ex]{0mm}{2ex}_{\\mmm}}({\\mathbf r}+r{\\mathbf e}_3 )     \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 are the unit vectors in direction of the coordinate axes , @xmath129 , and where a tilde @xmath130 is used to indicate the directional restriction .",
    "the sum @xmath131 runs over all @xmath132 lattice sites @xmath41 with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath133 is evaluated modulo @xmath117 .",
    "we now perform a simulated annealing algorithm to minimize the `` energy '' function @xmath134 defined as the sum of the squared deviations of @xmath135 from the experimental correlation function @xmath136 .",
    "each update starts with the exchange of two pixels , one from pore space , one from matrix space .",
    "let @xmath137 denote the number of the proposed update step .",
    "introducing an acceptance parameter @xmath138 , which may be interpreted as an @xmath137-dependent temperature , the proposed configuration is accepted with probability @xmath139 here the energy and the correlation function of the configuration is denoted as @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath141 does not require a complete recalculation .",
    "it suffices to update the correlation function @xmath142 of the previous configuration by adding or subtracting those products in ( [ eq : g_r ] ) which changed due to the exchange of pixels . in case",
    "the proposed move is rejected , the old configuration is restored .    the generation of a configuration with correlation @xmath136 is achieved by lowering @xmath143 . at low @xmath143 the system approaches a configuration that minimizes the energy function . in our simulations",
    "we lower @xmath138 with @xmath137 as @xmath144 we stop the simulation when 20000 consecutive updates are rejected . in our simulation this happened after @xmath145 updates ( @xmath146 steps per site ) .",
    "the resulting configuration @xmath124 for the simulated annealing reconstruction is displayed in figure [ smpld ] .",
    "our definition of the correlation function in ( [ eq : g_r ] ) deserves some comment .",
    "a complete evaluation of the correlation function as defined in ( [ eq : g_gen ] ) requires such a great numerical expense that the algorithm is too slow to allow threedimensional reconstructions within a reasonable time .",
    "therefore , to increase the speed of the algorithm , the correlation function is only evaluated along the directions of the coordinate axes as indicated in ( [ eq : g_r ] ) . as a result of this simplification",
    "the reconstructed sample may cease to be isotropic .",
    "it will in general deviate from the reference correlation function in all directions other than those of the axes . in the special case of the correlation function of the fontainebleau sandstone , however , this effect seems to be small ( see below ) .",
    "this may serve as an a posteriori justification for using ( [ eq : g_r ] ) .",
    "we begin our presentation of the results with an analysis of traditional quantities such as porosities and correlation functions of the four samples",
    ". then we proceed to a visual characterization of the threedimensional images .",
    "next we shall discuss local porosities and percolation probabilities , and finally we conclude with implications for transport properties .",
    "table [ ovrvw ] gives a synopsis of different properties of the four samples .",
    "the preparation of the various samples was described in detail in section [ samples ] .",
    "the dimensions and porosities also need no further comment .",
    "samples gf   and sa   were constructed to have the same correlation function as sample ex .",

    "we plot the directionally averaged correlation functions @xmath148 of the four samples where @xmath149 .",
    "@xmath150 differs clearly from the rest .",
    "accidentally , however , @xmath151 .",
    "@xmath115 differs from @xmath116 for small @xmath114 as discussed in section [ gf ] above .",
    "remember also that by construction @xmath115 is not expected to equal @xmath95 for @xmath114 larger than 30 .",
    "the discrepancy at small @xmath114 reflects the quality of the linear filter , and it is also responsible for the differences of the porosity and specific internal surface .",
    "although the reconstruction method of sample @xmath124 is intrinsically anisotropic the correlation function of sample sa   agrees also in the diagonal directions with that of sample ex .",
    "sample @xmath152 on the other hand has an anisotropic correlation function .",
    "if two samples have the same correlation function they are also expected to have also the same specific internal surface as calculated from @xmath153 the next line in table [ ovrvw ] labeled @xmath154 gives the specific internal surfaces .    if one defines a decay length by the first zero of the correlation function then the decay length is roughly @xmath155 for samples ex , gf   and sa . for sample",
    "dm   it is somewhat smaller mainly in the @xmath64- and @xmath156-direction .",
    "the correlation length , which will be of the order of the decay length , is thus relatively large compared to the system size .",
    "together with the fact that the percolation threshold for continuum systems is typically around @xmath157 this might explain why models gf   and sa   are connected in spite of their low value of the porosity .    in summary , the samples @xmath96 and @xmath124 were constructed to be indistinguishable with respect to porosity and correlations from @xmath120 .",
    "the imperfection of the reconstruction method for sample gf  , however , accounts for the deviations of its correlation function at small @xmath114 from that of sample ex .",
    "we now collect results from a visual comparison .",
    "visual inspection of figures [ smpla ] through [ smpld ] reveals that none of the models @xmath158 or @xmath124 resemble closely the experimental microstructure @xmath120 .",
    "this applies in particular to samples gf   and sa   which were constructed to match the traditional geometrical characteristics of sample ex , such as porosity , specific surface and correlation function .",
    "figures [ smpla ] through [ smpld ] suggest that samples @xmath96 and @xmath124 have isolated islands of matrix space although this can not be seen directly because the pore space is rendered opaque .",
    "isolated islands of matrix space can not exist in a real porous medium such as sample ex .",
    "they are also absent in the compaction and diagenesis model dm .",
    "the comparison is indicated in the line labeled `` isolated @xmath6 '' in table [ ovrvw ] .",
    "the pore surfaces in samples gf   and sa   are much rougher than in samples ex   and dm .",
    "sample dm   appears visually more homogeneous than the other samples .",
    "although there is no anisotropy visible for sample dm   from figure [ smplb ] its connectivity properties will be found below to be strongly anisotropic .    in summary the traditional characteristics such as porosity , specific surface and correlation functions are insufficient to distinguish different microstructures .",
    "visual inspection of the pore space by the human eye indicates that samples gf   and sa   have a similar structure which , however , differs from the structure of sample ex .",
    "although sample dm   resembles sample ex   more closely with respect to surface roughness it differs visibly in the shape of the grains .",
    "we turn to an analysis of the fluctuations in local porosities .",
    "the differences in visual appearance of the microstructures find a quantitative expression here .",
    "the local porosity distributions @xmath159 of the four samples at @xmath160 are displayed as the solid lines in figures [ lppa ] through [ lppd ] .",
    "the ordinates for these curves are plotted on the right vertical axis .",
    "the figures show that the original sample exhibits stronger porosity fluctuations than the three model samples except for sample sa   which comes close .",
    "sample dm   has the narrowest distribution which indicates that it is most homogeneous",
    ". figures [ lppa][lppd ] show also that the component at the origin , @xmath161 , is largest for sample ex , and smallest for sample gf . for samples dm   and sa   the values of @xmath161 are intermediate and comparable . plotting @xmath162 as a function of @xmath40 we find that this remains true for all @xmath40 .",
    "these results indicate that the experimental sample ex   is more strongly heterogeneous than the models , and that large regions of matrix space occur more frequently in sample ex .",
    "a similar conclusion may be drawn from the variance of local porosity fluctuations which will be studied below .",
    "the conclusion is also consistent with the results for @xmath57 shown in table [ ovrvw ] .",
    "@xmath57 gives the sidelength of the largest cube that can be fit into matrix space , and thus @xmath57 may be viewed as a measure for the size of the largest grain .",
    "table [ ovrvw ] shows that the experimental sample has a larger @xmath57 than all the models .",
    "it is interesting to note that plotting @xmath163 versus @xmath40 also shows that the curve for the experimental sample lies above those for the other samples for all @xmath40 .",
    "thus , also the size of the largest pore and the pore space heterogeneity are largest for sample ex . if @xmath164 is plotted for all four samples one finds two groups .",
    "the first group is formed by samples ex   and dm , the second by samples gf   and sa . within each group",
    "the curves @xmath164 nearly overlap , but they differ strongly between them",

    "the local porosity distributions @xmath169 show small spikes at equidistantly spaced porosities for samples ex   and dm , but not for samples gf   and sa .",
    "the spikes indicate that models ex   and dm   have a smoother surface than models gf   and sa . for smooth surfaces and small measurement cell size porosities corresponding to an interface",
    "intersecting the measurement cell occur with higher frequency , and this gives rise to spikes .",
    "the presence of isolated islands of pore or matrix space reduces these spikes .",
    "it is unclear at present whether the spikes persist when the measurement cells are chosen to be nonoverlapping .",
    "visual inspection of figures [ smpla ] through [ smpld ] did not allow us to recognize the degree of connectivity of the various samples . a quantitative characterization of the connectivity is provided by the local percolation probabilities @xcite , and it is here that the samples differ most dramatically .",
    "the samples ex , dm  , gf   and sa   are globally connected in all three directions .",
    "this , however , does not imply that they have similar connectivity .",
    "the last line in table [ ovrvw ] gives the fraction of blocking cells at the porosity @xmath170 and for @xmath57 .",
    "it gives a first indication that the connectivity of samples dm   and gf   is , in fact , much poorer than that of the experimental sample ex .",

    "first one notes that sample dm   is strongly anisotropic in its connectivity .",
    "it has a higher connectivity in the @xmath173-direction than in the @xmath64- or @xmath156-direction .",

    "@xmath174 for sample",
    "dm   differs from that of sample ex   although their correlation functions in the @xmath173-direction are very similar .",
    "the @xmath175-functions for samples ex   and dm   rise much more rapidly than those for samples gf   and sa . the inflection point of the @xmath175-curves for samples ex   and dm   is much closer to the most probable porosity ( peak ) than in samples gf   and sa .",
    "all of this indicates that connectivity in cells with low porosity is higher for samples ex   and dm   than for samples gf   and sa . in samples",
    "gf   and sa   only cells with high porosity are percolating on average . in sample",
    "dm   the curves @xmath176 and @xmath177 show strong fluctuations for @xmath178 at values of @xmath73 much larger than the @xmath179 or @xmath180 .",
    "this indicates a large number of high porosity cells which are nevertheless blocked .",
    "the reason for this is perhaps that the linear compaction process in the underlying model blocks horizontal pore throats and decreases horizontal spatial continuity more effectively than in the vertical direction , as shown in @xcite , table 1 p. 142 .    the absence of spikes in @xmath169 for samples gf   and sa   combined with the fact that cells with average porosity ( @xmath181 ) are rarely percolating suggests that these samples have a random morphology similar to percolation .",
    "the connectivity analysis of local porosity theory allows to make some predictions for transport properties ( such as conductivity or permeability ) without actually calculating them .",
    "a detailed comparison between the predictions of local porsity theory and exact calculation of transport properties will appear elsewhere @xcite these predictions are made by calculating the total fraction of percolating cells eq .",

    "the insets in figures [ lppa ] through [ lppd ] show the functions @xmath182 for @xmath183 for each sample .",

    "we plot the curves @xmath184 of all four samples in a single figure .",
    "the samples fall into two groups \\{ex , dm } and \\{gf , sa } that behave very differently .",
    "figure [ total ] shows that reconstruction methods @xcite based on correlation functions do not reproduce the connectivity properties of porous media . as a consequence , within the effective medium approximation of local porosity theory @xcite samples gf   and sa   would both yield much lower permeabilities or conductivities than those of samples ex   and dm . based on these results it appears questionable whether correlation function reconstruction can produce reliable models for the prediction of transport .",
