    "in order to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies it is necessary to measure the distribution of galaxy properties and how they evolve with redshift . however , most studies of galaxies look at the distributions of galaxies observed properties like luminosity , color , size and morphology . because of attenuation by dust these properties can change with galaxy inclination and therefore what is measured is a convolution of a galaxy s intrinsic properties and the effects of dust .",
    "this complicates attempts to understand how galaxy properties evolve with redshift as any observed change could be due to variations in dust properties or evolution of galaxies intrinsic properties .",
    "furthermore , comparison to theory is made more difficult because a model of attenuation from dust as a function of inclination is needed to compare theoretical models to observations .    for these reasons it is useful to determine inclination corrections for galaxies .",
    "this can be done for large samples in a statistical manner by searching for correlations between a galaxy property and inclination , and then assuming that correlation should be removed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we perform such an analysis on a sample of galaxies from the nyu - vagc @xcite which are imaged in both the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and the two micron all sky survey @xcite .",
    "this gives us @xmath0 galaxies with eight wavebands of coverage from @xmath1 to @xmath2 with which to determine inclination corrections .    ) while orange points highly inclined ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "clearly , the observed properties of face - on and edge - on galaxies differ , with edge - on galaxies being fainter and redder . however , when inclination corrections are applied the two show a comparable distribution in the color - magnitude diagram . also , the fraction of galaxies that one would consider red decreases when going from observed to intrinsic color . ]    when inclination corrections are applied to the sample interesting changes to the population of galaxies can be noted .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram for observed ( left panel ) and intrinsic ( right panel ) galaxy properties .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram changes in a number of ways .",
    "galaxies redder than the red sequence are found in the observed color - magnitude diagram , but not once inclination corrections have been applied .",
    "also , the fraction of galaxies with @xmath4 in the observed color - magnitude diagram is @xmath5 .",
    "this drops to @xmath6 when going to the intrinsic color - magnitude diagram a reduction of almost one third in the number of red galaxies a significant change",
    ". please see @xcite for more detail ."
