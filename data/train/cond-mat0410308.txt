    "furthermore , experimental efforts are just now succeeding at measuring single electron spin relaxation times @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the exponential size of the hilbert space of these spin systems and the variety of channels for decoherence makes an exact analysis of spin dynamics virtually impossible ( without the use of a quantum computer)@xcite . as a result , it is often necessary to resort to approximations or perturbative treatments to address the timescale of electron spin decoherence , even using a simplified hamiltonian .",
    "because approximations are inevitable , it is important to know which of these can be rigorously justified . in particular",
    ", it is necessary to know which terms in a very complex system hamiltonian can be ignored because they do not contribute to decoherence on the experimentally relevant timescale . in this paper , we consider electron spin decoherence induced by the nuclear spins . in particular , we focus on the relevance of the @xmath6 term in the hamiltonian ( see ) , which comes from the contact hyperfine coupling of the electron and its surrounding nuclei .    previously , the effect of the hyperfine interaction on decoherence has been studied in special cases or using various approximation methods .",
    "recently , erlingsson et .",
    "al used a semi - classical approximation to study electron spin correlation functions at low fields ( @xmath7 , where @xmath3 is on the order of the overhauser field , see below ) @xcite .",
    "they found that the correlation functions were characterized by complex dynamics which did not decay , even at long times .",
    "work by khaetskii et al .",
    "has characterized the timescale of the logitudinal spin correlation for an electron coupled to surrounding nuclei via the hyperfine interaction @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , exact solutions for the case of completely polarized nuclei and for the case of homogeneous coupling , as well as perturbative solutions for the general , inhomogeneous situation were presented . from these solutions , the behavior of the general unpolarized ,",
    "inhomogeneous case was inferred .",
    "their results indicate that the logitudinal spin correlation time is on the order of @xmath8 for a single quantum dot and on the order of @xmath9 for an ensemble of dots .",
    "gate imperfections due to the hyperfine coupling were also treated using perturbation theory in @xcite .",
    "however , it was noted in @xcite that the perturbative solution would diverge to second - order and was therefore potentially unreliable .",
    "more recently , coish et al .",
    "have treated the behavior of this system using a generalized master equation , again confirming a power - law decay for short timescales on the order of @xmath8 @xcite . in general , though , all treatments based on a time - dependent perturbation expansion will be valid only at times smaller than some maximum timescale specified by the order of the expansion [ w.a .",
    "coish , private communication ] ] .",
    "although such treatments are useful for examining short - timescale and small - magnitude fluctuations in electron polarization , in this paper we are interested in the long - timescale dynamics of the electron spin which leads to @xmath10 decay of the longitudinal or in - plane polarization of the electron .",
    "note that we are not claiming any particular functional form for the decay of coherence , exponential or otherwise .",
    "rather , we are evaluating the timescale on which the longitudinal and in - plane magnetization decays to a constant fraction ( in this case @xmath10 ) of its initial value .",
    "moreover , we focus on the high magnetic field regime which is relevant for the recent experimental developments in single spin read - out ( @xmath11 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that at sufficiently high magnetic fields the electron - nuclei flip - flop term ( @xmath12 in ) which is due to the hyperfine interaction can be neglected as a direct source for electron spin decoherence . in this paper , we would like to 1 ) justify this assumption and 2 ) determine how strong a magnetic field must be applied to safely neglect this term . rather than resort to approximation to estimate the numerical value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , this paper will instead place rigorous , non - perturbative lower bounds on the spin relaxation time of the electron in the high - field regime ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "furthermore , we will explicitly take into account the application of the spin echo sequence which is often used experimentally to remove inhomogeneous broadening . to determine the importance of the electron - nuclear flip - flop term",
    ", we use the hamiltonian presented in @xcite which contains only the contact hyperfine term . in doing so",
    ", we can effectively isolate the decoherence contribution that derives exclusively from the hyperfine interaction .",
    "when the timescale of this hyperfine - induced decoherence is significantly greater than the timescale of decoherence due to other mechanisms ( such as spectral diffusion induced by inter - nuclear dipolar coupling@xcite ) then it seems reasonable to ignore the direct effects of hyperfine coupling as a channel for electron spin decoherence .",
    "it is important to define what we mean by `` electron spin decoherence '' .",
    "typically , electron spins are assumed to undergo simple exponential decay governed by the bloch equations .",
    "thus the coherence times @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be defined as the timescales of this exponential decay . however , when decay is non - exponential , as in this system ( see @xcite ) , there is some flexibility in the definition of the coherence times .",
    "electron spin dynamics includes both short - timescale fluctuations ( which are generally small in magnitude @xcite ) and long - timescale ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) decay ; in this paper , we take `` electron spin decoherence '' to mean the latter . in other words ,",
    "the coherence time of an electron is defined as the time it takes for the longitudinal or transverse polarization of an initially polarized electron spin to decay to a specific fraction , e.g. @xmath10 , of its initial value .",
    "the decay of the in - plane magnetization is understood to occur in the context of a spin echo experiment .",
    "spin echo experiments are designed to remove the effects of inhomogeneous broadening due to variations in the local field experienced by an ensemble of electron - nuclei systems ( i.e. multiple independent systems ) . when applied to a single electron spin",
    ", a spin echo can be understood as removing the inhomogeneous broadening resulting from an ensemble of initial states of the single electron - nuclei system .",
    "the remaining decay of the in - plane magnetization comes from fluctuating overhauser fields , which can not in general be removed by the spin echo ( but see @xcite for numerical evidence that a substantial part of hyperfine - induced fluctuations may , in fact , be reversible ) . because only _ bounds _ on relaxation behavior are desired",
    ", our analysis of this decay can be completely rigorous , despite the complexity of the problem and the size of the hilbert space .",

    "discussion and conclusions follow in sec .",
    "let @xmath14 be the electron spin precessing in a magnetic field @xmath2 applied in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the electron spin is coupled to @xmath15 nuclear spins @xmath16 via the hyperfine interaction , characterized by the coupling constants @xmath17 . due to the hyperfine coupling ,",
    "the nuclei induce an effective overhauser field on the electron with magnitude @xmath18 .",
    "here we consider the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the gyromagnetic ratios of the electron and nuclei , respectively ( @xmath22 ) . can be written as @xmath23 this hamiltonian conserves the total spin angular momentum @xmath24 ; hence , the total number of `` down '' spins is conserved . for convenience",
    ", we will label each of these blocks by the quantum number @xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the total number of `` down '' spins ( i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "then the hamiltonian can be block diagonalized based on the @xmath28 operator @xcite .",
    "there will be @xmath29 blocks , one for each possible value of @xmath25 , and the @xmath30 block will be an @xmath31 matrix .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , it will be assumed that all analysis applies to some subspace labeled by a particular value of @xmath25 .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath32 , commutes with the @xmath33 operator .",
    "thus , the eigenstates of @xmath32 can be labeled by the @xmath5-polarization of the electron . on the other hand",
    ", the full hamiltonian @xmath34 does not commute with @xmath33 because @xmath35 connects electron spin - up states to electron spin - down states , and vice - versa . at high fields greater than some critical field @xmath36",
    ", the zeeman energy of the electron will dominate the energy of the eigenstates , and the electron spin - up and electron spin - down manifolds will be well separated in energy .",
    "thus , if the perturbation is in some sense smaller in magnitude than this energy gap , the effects of the perturbation will be small and @xmath33 will still be an approximately good label for eigenstates of @xmath34 ( see figure 1 ) .    our analysis in sec .",
    "ii.a demonstrates that if the magnetic field @xmath2 is greater than the critical field @xmath3 , then the electron spin magnetization @xmath37 never changes appreciably . because the eigenstates of @xmath34 are nearly eigenstates of @xmath33 at high fields , the @xmath5-polarization of the electron does not undergo substantial ( i.e. @xmath10 ) decay ( this result matches the perturbative result found in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , based on these arguments , a field - dependent bound is placed on the maximum fluctuation of @xmath33 from its initial value : the greater the field , the smaller the maximum possible fluctuation .",
    "again , it should be emphasized that there may be small magnitude fluctuations in @xmath38 , which occur on a finite timescale .",
    "however , because our definition of @xmath0 ( the timescale for @xmath10 decay of @xmath37 ) quantifies the large - scale coherence properties of the electron spin , the absence of large - scale decay renders @xmath0 effectively infinite .",
    "although @xmath0 is infinite for large magnetic fields , dephasing processes can still occur provided that they conserve the @xmath5-polarization of the electron spin .",
    "although this statement seems like a contradiction given that the perturbation , @xmath35 , flips the electron spin , virtual transitions involving @xmath39 can nevertheless flip pairs of nuclear spins without affecting the electron spin . for this reason , it is also important to place a lower bound on @xmath1 .",
    "derivation of the lower bound on @xmath1 in sec .",
    "ii.b follows a different methodology than the bound on @xmath0 . because @xmath1 is defined as the timescale of the decay of the spin echo envelope @xcite , a lower bound on the magnitude of @xmath40 after a pulse echo sequence implies a lower bound on @xmath1 . specifically , the standard definition of @xmath1 is the minimal time , @xmath41 such that , @xmath42 where a @xmath43 pulse is applied at time @xmath41 ( we have dropped a factor of @xmath44 for convenience ) .",
    "it is assumed that for an infinite system , there will be no large - scale recurrence in @xmath45 , but only dissipative behavior .",
    "small magnitude recurrence , due for instance to echo modulation @xcite , may still exist , but large - scale recurrence on the order of @xmath10 is assumed to be absent .",
    "even if this large - scale recurrence does exist , the lower bound on @xmath1 is still valid . in particular ,",
    "if it can be shown that for some value of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , it follows that @xmath48 .",
    "this bound on @xmath49 can be proven using a variational argument .",
    "every trial state @xmath50 induces a probability distribution over the eigenenergies of @xmath34 .",
    "the mean of this energy distribution is given by the expectation value @xmath51 likewise , the variance of this energy distribution is @xmath52 the variance of the energy will be equal to zero if and only if @xmath50 is an eigenstate of @xmath34 ( or a superposition of degenerate eigenstates ) . for all other states which are superpositions of non - degenerate eigenstates",
    ", the variance will be greater than zero .",
    "the essential feature of the theorems given in sec .",
    "ii.b is that the dynamics undergone by any state @xmath50 are limited in timescale by the variance in energy of that state .",
    "using this idea , it can be shown that the dephasing processes of the system have a timescale governed by the energy @xmath53 conceptually , our bound on @xmath1 makes mathematically rigorous the idea that the coherence time of a state is inversely proportional to its linewidth .    before proceeding to the proof of these results",
    ", two important points must be made .",
    "first , this method constructs only a rigorous _ lower bound _ on @xmath1 ; it does not predict the actual value of @xmath1 nor does it claim to be a _",
    "tight _ lower bound on @xmath1 . in fact , numerical work suggests that the spin echo pulse may actually remove nearly all hyperfine - induced decoherence , leading to only small magnitude decay of @xmath54 under the spin echo sequence for all times , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "however , this evidence is numerical and has been confirmed only for small numbers of spins ( @xmath55 ) . in this paper",
    "we are interested in what rigorous statements can be made regarding the @xmath1 time for a large system ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "second , it is the special structure of this system at high @xmath2 fields that allows a _ useful _ bound to be constructed . though this method is general and can be used to construct valid bounds on @xmath1 for other systems , these bounds may prove to be useless in practice ( for instance , the rigorous bound that @xmath57 is valid , but is a practically useless bound ) .",
    "fortunately , we find that our method provides practically useful lower bound values for real systems of relevance to quantum information processing ( see )",
    ".      the proof of the bound on @xmath0 will be given first and will be organized as follows .",
    "first , we will show that the eigenstates of @xmath34 can be divided into two subspaces , the @xmath58 subspace and the @xmath59 subspace ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "eigenstates contained in the @xmath58 subspace contain large contributions from electron spin - up states , and eigenstates in the @xmath59 subspace contain large contributions from electron spin - down states . in other words",
    ", @xmath33 is an approximate quantum number for the true eigenstates of @xmath34 .",
    "second , we will show that this fact places bounds on the eigenvalues of @xmath34 ( theorem 2 ) .",
    "next , we will show that every eigenstate of @xmath32 is almost completely contained within either the @xmath58 or @xmath59 subspace of @xmath34 ( theorem 3 ) . to complete the bound on @xmath0",
    ", we will show that these previous statements imply a lower bound on the decay of @xmath33 from its initial state ( theorem 4 ) .    for future convenience",

    "@xmath63 is the sum of all @xmath15 hyperfine coupling constants and therefore represents the maximum magnitude of the overhauser field .",
    "the matrix @xmath32 commutes with the @xmath33 and @xmath64 operators ; hence eigenstates of @xmath32 can be labeled by the @xmath5-polarization of the electron spin and the @xmath5-polarization of the nuclei .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the @xmath67 and @xmath68 polarized states of the electron spin , respectively , and let @xmath69 be an @xmath15-bit string of @xmath70s and @xmath71s representing the @xmath5-polarization of the @xmath15 nuclei .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath32 are of the form @xmath72 or @xmath73 ( it should be remembered that @xmath69 will contain @xmath25 down spins and @xmath74 will contain @xmath75 down spins , since the total number of down spins , including the electron spin , is conserved ) . the eigenvalue @xmath76 corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath72 is @xmath77 similarly , the eigenvalue @xmath78 corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath73 is , @xmath79 from it is clear that the eigenvalues of @xmath32 fall within certain ranges . in particular , we can write @xmath80 where we have defined @xmath81 - a_{max}\\right ) \\\\    \\label{equation::e0bound2 } e_{0,max}^\\uparrow & = & + \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\gamma_s b +   \\frac{1}{2}\\left(n-2l\\right)\\hbar\\gamma_i b +   \\frac{1}{4}\\hbar^2\\left(2a[n - l ] - a_{max}\\right ) \\\\",

    ", it can be demonstrated that an energy gap exists if @xmath83+a[n - l+1]-a_{max}\\right).\\ ] ] an additional condition that emerges from theorem 2 sets the critical field slightly higher than would imply .",
    "furthermore , we would like the definition of @xmath3 to be independent of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for the remainder of the paper , we will assume that we are in the high - field regime defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 typical values of this critical field for various systems are given in table 1 .",
    "using these facts , we now show that the eigenstates of @xmath34 are near - eigenstates of @xmath33 .",
    "we define the projection operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 such that @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the identity operator on the nuclear spins .",

    "we will show that at high fields , the @xmath5-polarization of a state does not vary substantially from its initial polarization .",

    "the zeeman energy of the electron can be exchanged with the nuclear zeeman energy , providing a new channel for @xmath0 relaxation . in order to apply our bound to the gaas systems",

    "we then let @xmath239 , and apply our proof as before . again , the important parameters are shown in table 1 .",

    ", the first term applies the same scattering process to an electron spin - down state .",
    "taking the difference of these two terms allows cancellation to occur , reducing the magnitude of @xmath246 , and corresponding to the refocusing of spin states accomplished by the spin echo experiment .",
    "if no spin echo were applied , then the first of these terms would be absent , and the magnitude of @xmath246 would be substantially larger , leading to a faster decay of coherence .    in summary , we have used a completely non - perturbative approach to place a rigorous lower bounds on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 coherence times of an electron spin coupled via the contact hyperfine interaction to a lattice of nuclear spins . for @xmath0",
    ", we have shown that for @xmath36 , the @xmath5-polarization of the electron is nearly conserved by time evolution ; hence @xmath0 is infinite . for @xmath1 , we have obtained an analytic expression for a lower bound @xmath218 , having explicitly taken into account the effects of a spin echo experiment , which would be required to remove any additional inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "this analysis holds above some critical field satisfying the high field condition , @xmath248 .",
    "we have also assumed that at the start of an experiment , the electron is polarized and uncoupled from the completely mixed nuclear initial state ; similar results can be derived for any highly mixed nuclear initial state . in general , this method can be used to determine when the contact hyperfine interaction can be safely neglected as a direct mechanism for electron spin decoherence .",
    "we have demonstrated the utility of the bounds for a donor impurity in si , and -within the approximation that spontaneous nuclear polarization transfer does not occur- for a donor impurity in gaas , and a gaas quantum dot .",
    "future directions for this investigation are two - fold .",
    "first , numerical simulations indicate that the coherence time @xmath1 due to hyperfine coupling only might , in fact , be substantially higher than the lower bound given here , possibly even infinite @xcite .",

    "removing this term would greatly improve the lower bound on @xmath1 ; unfortunately , it is unclear how this term can be suppressed . also , we have not taken advantage of the substantial symmetries present in the system @xcite . taking advantage of these symmetries in our analysis",
    "could dramatically increase our lower bound on @xmath1 .",
    "second , this method might be extended to yield bounds on the fidelity of single qubit operations on the electron spin , which would be important for any solid state quantum computing applications .",
