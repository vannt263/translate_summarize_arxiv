    "quantum many - body systems with correlations are notoriously difficult to describe theoretically .",
    "many analytical and numerical tools have been developed to tackle such problems .",
    "tools which are employed ubiquitously are unitary transformations .",
    "famous applications are the fermionic bogoliubov transformations in the mean - field theory of superconductivity by bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer @xcite ( bcs ) or the bosonic bogoliubov transformations arising in linear spin - wave theory of quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "@xcite these are exact transformations which use the algebraic properties of fermions and bosons , respectively .",
    "they yield diagonal hamiltonians if they are applied to bilinear initial hamiltonians .",
    "another class of unitary transformations are those which are not exact but approximate because they rely on an expansion in a small parameter .",
    "a well - known example is the antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath0 as it is derived from a half - filled hubbard model with hopping @xmath1 and local repulsion @xmath2 implying @xmath3 ( see for instance ref .  ) . obviously , higher contributions @xmath4 are neglected ,",
    "but they can also be computed systematically .",
    "@xcite    moreover , the hubbard model is not diagonalized by the transformation , but mapped to an effective spin model .",
    "this mapping implies a simplification because the relevant part of the hilbert space ( here , spin degrees of freedom ) has been separated from the remainder ( charge degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the remainder does not need to be considered .",
    "it is said that it has been eliminated or integrated out .",
    "another famous example in the same line is the derivation of an attractive interaction between electrons from the exchange of a phonon .",
    "this well - known step precedes the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "we discuss it below in the first part of the next section because it constitutes an excellent example that different unitary transforms yield different effective models , even in leading order .",
    "in particular , it shows that a continuous version generically yields effective models with less singular coefficients as functions of the bare parameters . a related approach , which is not continuous but iterative , is the projective renormalization ( prg ) , @xcite and it has also been applied successfully to electron - phonon interactions .",
    "@xcite    the main goals of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we show how continuous unitary transformations ( cuts ) can be used to perturbatively derive effective hamilton operators in real space .",
    "this goal has been realized for an unperturbed hamiltonian with equidistant spectrum by perturbative cut ( pcut ) .",
    "@xcite the gist of the pcut is recalled in the following .",
    "the matrix elements of the effective models derived by pcut have to be computed by evaluating long products of operators for various clusters . in this work ,",
    "we enhance the applicability of such an approach to unperturbed _",
    "non_-equidistant spectra by formulating the cut directly in second quantization , i.e. , in the prefactors of monomials of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the resulting transformation will be called enhanced perturbative cut ( epcut ) for distinction .",
    "the approach is exemplified for a uniform and for an alternating spin ladder .",
    "the latter has a non - equidistant spectrum if only the rung couplings are considered .",
    "the second main goal is to establish a robust extrapolation of the perturbative results of the epcut .",
    "we will show that a direct evaluation of the perturbatively established flow equations provides a very robust and reliable way to extrapolate the perturbative results .",
    "this approach will be called directly evaluated enhanced perturbative cut ( deepcut ) .",
    "the article is set up as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly exemplify the versatility of continuous unitary transformations by deriving the bcs electron - electron attraction .",
    "we introduce the perturbative cut and the self - similar cut ( scut ) as predecessors of the epcut and the deepcut . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the harmonic oscillator with quartic perturbation and our paradigm model , spin ladders , for which we illustrate the general approaches . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the epcut and develop the deepcut from it .",
    "many technical aspects are discussed ; a focus is the definition of simplifying rules which allow us to compute high orders efficiently . in sec .",
    "v , results of the epcut and the deepcut are presented for the uniform antiferromagnetic spin ladder with @xmath5 .",
    "results for the alternating spin ladder , which does not have an equidistant unperturbed spectrum , are shown in sec .",
    "the article terminates by the conclusions in sec .",
    "the focus is here on previous variants of continuous unitary transformations in order to show from where we start and in which respect we go beyond presently known methods .",
    "but , there are also related approaches such as projective renormalization , high - order series expansions on the basis of the linked - cluster theorem , and the coupled - cluster method .",
    "the frhlich transformation @xcite eliminates phononic degrees of freedom from an electron - phonon system in leading order of the coupling to derive an electron - electron interaction from an electron - phonon coupling . starting from the hamiltonian    @xmath6    this transformation generates an attractive interaction in the bcs channel @xmath7 with the matrix element @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "this explains the formation of cooper pairs and conventional superconductivity .",
    "it is interesting to note that in standard treatments , the interaction is usually approximated by a constant , leaving out any discussion of the resonance singularity in .",
    "it is , however , possible to achieve the elimination of the phonon degrees of freedom by a different , continuous unitary transformation ( cut ) .",
    "this approach relies on a continuously parametrized anti - hermitian generator @xmath11 of the differential unitary transformation @xmath12\\ ] ] of the hamiltonian @xmath13 ; the transformation starts at @xmath14 and ends@xcite at @xmath15 .",
    "one possible choice for the generator leading to a convergent flow @xcite for @xmath16 is @xmath17 $ ] where @xmath18 is the diagonal part of the hamiltonian .",
    "integrating the flow equation from @xmath14 to @xmath19 yields for the bcs channel @xcite in leading order in @xmath20 @xmath21 the eye - catching fact in @xmath22 is that it does not have a resonant energy denominator .",
    "hence , this result is much smoother . in particular",
    ", it implies an attractive interaction for all parameters .    the standard bcs interaction is a constant up to some phononic cutoff energy @xmath23 .",
    "this result can be derived rigorously by a modification of the generator . in an eigen basis of @xmath18 ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath24 are chosen @xcite to be @xmath25 .",
    "then , we find @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the heaviside step function .",
    "again , there is only attractive interaction .",
    "in addition , the interaction is only active in a restricted energy interval and zero outside .",
    "a similar result was obtained by mielke using a self - similar approach .",
    "@xcite    it is very remarkable that all three approaches ( [ eq : bcs_frohlich ] ) , ( [ eq : bcs_lenz ] ) , and ( [ eq : bcs_mku ] ) are different in their outcome although they do the same : eliminating the linear electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we stress that this is not a spurious result , but relies on the fact that the unitary transformations are indeed different even in leading order .",
    "they express virtual processes in a different way .",
    "but , the energy - conserving processes at @xmath28 are the same in all three results .",
    "this has to be so because such scattering processes can in principle be measured which implies that they have to be independent from the chosen basis .",
    "we draw the readers attention to the fact that we are dealing from now on with cuts with a unique reference state .",
    "this means that the ground - state is mapped by the cut to the vacuum of excitations . in the previous section , the mapping to effective models such as the heisenberg exchange model or the bcs model still left a many - body problem to be solved .",
    "high - order series expansions have long been used to compute reliable ground - state energies @xcite and dispersions in strongly correlated systems . @xcite no particular assumptions on the unperturbed spectrum are required .",
    "ground - state energies and dispersions can be computed straightforwardly because the states are uniquely determined by their quantum number , for instance , the momentum , even before the perturbation is switched on .",
    "this means it is sufficient to perform the perturbation for a one - dimensional subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "states of two and more particles are more subtle because their subspaces are extensively large .",
    "for instance , binding energies can not be computed as series unless the binding occurs already in linear order .",
    "generally , unitary or orthogonal transformations must be introduced to define the perturbative approach on large subspaces.@xcite for static ground - state properties , the coupled - cluster method @xcite represents also a powerful means to learn systematically from clusters of finite size about the physics of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the perturbative cut ( pcut ) was the first approach to systematically address many - particle states .",
    "@xcite its starting point is a hamiltonian which can be written in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the unperturbed hamiltonian with an equidistant spectrum as additional assumption . for simplicity , we set its energy spacing to unity .",
    "each energy quantum can be seen as an elementary excitation , a quasiparticle , so that @xmath30 counts the number of quasiparticles up to an irrelevant constant offset .",
    "the expansion parameter is @xmath31 and the terms in the perturbation are split according to their effect on the quasiparticle number @xmath30 : the terms in @xmath32 increase the number of energy quanta by @xmath33 .",
    "obviously , @xmath34 holds .",
    "generically , there is an upper bound @xmath35 to the change of energy quanta . in pcut",
    ", the parametrization @xmath36 is used as an ansatz for the flowing hamiltonian with coefficients @xmath37 .",
    "the components of the vector @xmath38 take the values @xmath39 ; the vector has the dimension @xmath40 .",
    "the notation @xmath41 stands for the product @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite choosing @xmath43 the flow equation generates a hierarchy of differential equations in powers of @xmath31 for the coefficients @xmath37 . in each finite order ,",
    "the differential equations are closed and can be solved by computer aided analytics . eventually , one obtains the general expansion for an effective hamiltonian which conserves the number of elementary excitations @xmath44 the renormalized coefficients @xmath45 are fractions ( without imaginary part ) and the conservation of the number of quasiparticles is implied by the cross sum @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the result is very general ; to put it to practical use its irreducible effect on zero , one , two , and more quasiparticles is computed . in this way ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is obtained in second quantized form @xcite .",
    "remarkable achievements of this approach are a quantitative understanding of inelastic scattering in spin ladders @xcite , of spectral densities in spin chains @xcite , of excitations in the kitaev model @xcite , of excitations in the toric code @xcite , and of the ionic hubbard model @xcite to name a few extended systems where the ground - state is described as a vacuum of excitations .",
    "conceptually , the most significant achievement of pcut is that whole subspaces are treated perturbatively .",
    "the generality of the pcut result is surely one of its advantages .",
    "the fact that it can only deal with equidistant spectra is a certain caveat , not shared by the high - order series expansions described in ref .  .",
    "another caveat is that the approach does not allow for modifications of the generator .",
    "one way to circumvent the above - mentioned restrictions concerning the unperturbed spectrum and the choice of the generator is to pass from a perturbative evaluation to a self - similar one .",
    "the approach follows a straightforward strategy .",
    "one chooses a set of operators , which serves as a basis .",
    "the hamiltonian and the generator are described as linear combinations of these operators . by commuting hamiltonian and generator and re - expanding the result in the same operator basis",
    ", the flow equation induces a differential equation system ( des ) in the coefficients of the basis operators .",
    "a more detailed description follows in sec .",
    "iii below .",
    "we stress that in the latter step a certain truncation is required .",
    "@xcite unless the set of operators is closed under commutation , the commutator @xmath48 $ ] comprises terms which can not be expanded exactly in the operator basis .",
    "thus , this step generically requires an approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian is kept in a self - similar form defined by the selected operator basis .    depending on the system , the truncating approximation",
    "can be controlled by a small parameter @xcite or by the spatial locality of the selected set of operators.@xcite we stress that in the scut approach , the choice of the operator basis and of the generator uniquely defines the des of the flow equation .",
    "clearly , the advantage of the scut over the pcut is its larger versatility .",
    "yet , it is less general in the sense that the flow equation has to be solved for each model and each operator basis anew .    to derive",
    "a systematic perturbative expansion by scut is not an obvious step .",
    "it is one of our two main goals to show how this can be done and how it can be done efficiently .",
    "thus , the derivations and considerations in sec .",
    "iv are based on the scut approach and combine it with a perturbative expansion in order to reach the enhanced perturbative cut .",
    "we illustrate our approach by applying it to two models which are introduced below .",
    "the first is a zero - dimensional , perturbed harmonic oscillator and it is chosen for its simplicity . the second are one - dimensional spin ladders which represent well - understood extended models .",
    "we analyze the perturbed harmonic oscillator    [ eq : h_toy ] @xmath49 with ground - state energy @xmath50 , frequency @xmath51 , and bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath52 .",

    "but , the generator terms involving more quasiparticles have a higher minimum order @xmath154 so that a single commutation with them affects coefficients only in a higher order @xmath173 .",
    "in fact , for the used generator schemes , the ratio between @xmath172 and @xmath154 for new terms developed during the flow can not exceed the corresponding ratio for generator terms present in the initial hamiltonian . therefore , it is sufficient to consider only commutations with the initial terms in our simplification rules .",
    "the above generic simplification rule can be easily adapted to other models as long as the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath30 is block diagonal .",
    "otherwise , @xmath30 will lead to generator terms of order zero , which means that terms with high quasiparticle number can influence the coefficients of terms with low quasiparticle number in the same order .",

    "but , the derivation and application of an appropriate polarization - sensitive simplification rule is beyond the scope of this article , which aims primarily at the proof - of - principle demonstration of epcut and deepcut .",
    "as stated in sec .  [ struct : basic_a - posteriori ] , the performance of the epcut algorithm can be enhanced significantly by avoiding the computation of unnecessary commutators . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the two normal - ordered products @xmath351 and @xmath352 in @xmath353 = td - dt\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] separately . here",
    "we discuss @xmath351 explicitly ; @xmath352 is treated in the same way . for an analog of the basic simplification rule ( sec .",
    "[ struct : basic_a - posteriori ] ) , we estimate the minimum numbers of creation and annihilation operators @xmath354 and @xmath355 which can appear in the monomials of the normal - ordering of @xmath351 .",
    "we use the numbers @xmath356 , and @xmath357 from each factor as input . at most @xmath358 pairs of local operators",
    "can cancel in the process of normal - ordering .",
    "hence it follows    @xmath359    using these estimates in eq .",
    ", one obtains an upper bound @xmath360 with @xmath125 being the number of the targeted quasiparticle subspace . considering also the inverse product @xmath352",
    ", the commutator @xmath361 $ ] does not need to be calculated while evaluating @xmath170 if @xmath362 holds .    as an example",
    ", we consider the second order calculation ( @xmath363 ) given in tabs .  [ tab : list_2nd_order ] and [ tab : diffeq_2nd_order ] for the ground - state energy ( @xmath156 ) . calculating @xmath364 , the commutator of the monomials    @xmath365    with @xmath366 occurs .",
    "the numbers of local creation and annihilation operators are given by    @xmath367    in the normal - ordering of @xmath351 , no local operator can cancel ( @xmath368 ) implying @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "for the product @xmath352 , @xmath371 pairs of local operators may cancel implying @xmath372 and @xmath373 .",
    "using eq .  , we find    @xmath374    since the commutator @xmath375 $ ] yields monomials with a maximum order of at most 1 in the calculation of @xmath364 , it can not yield relevant contributions .",
    "hence it does not need to be evaluated at all .",
    "but in a calculation of order @xmath376 or aiming at a higher quasiparticle subspace @xmath377 , eq .",
    "yields higher upper bounds for the maximum order and thus the commutator must be evaluated explicitly .",
    "note that this basic _ a priori _ rule is only sensitive to changes of the quasiparticle _",
    "numbers_. it can not anticipate that the commutator in this example actually vanishes due to other properties of the hard - core algebra of the triplons .",
    "the real - space structure of the commutator arguments @xmath378 and @xmath379 allows us to extend the above a - priori rule in analogy to the extended a - posteriori rule in app .",
    "[ struct : extended_a - posteriori ] .",
    "let @xmath380 and @xmath381 be the clusters of the creation operators in @xmath378 and in @xmath379 , respectively .",
    "analogously , @xmath382 are the clusters of their respective annihilation operators .",
    "normal - ordering the product @xmath351 can cancel local operators only on the intersection @xmath383 due to the locality of the triplon algebra , the commutator vanishes if none of the clusters overlap @xmath384 thus the normal - ordered product @xmath351 definitely has local creation operators on the union cluster    @xmath385    and local annihilation operators on the union cluster @xmath386    there may be additional creation or annihilation operators , but no general statements can be made on their existence . in this sense , the right - hand sides of eqs .   and are minimum clusters for the normal - ordered product @xmath351 .",
    "they can be used in eq .   to obtain an upper bound for the maximum order @xmath387 and the corresponding reasoning",
    "is used to obtain @xmath388 .",
    "this makes it possible to avoid the computation of the commutator @xmath375 $ ] .",
    "moreover , one can use the intersections @xmath389 and @xmath390 to exploit the hard - core property of the triplons : the normal - ordered product @xmath351 will vanish if @xmath380 and @xmath391 are not disjoint or likewise if @xmath392 and @xmath393 are not disjoint because the creation or annihilation of two triplons is attempted on the same site .",
    "although it is less strict , the basic _ a priori _ rule has the advantage to be much more lightweight in comparison to the extended _ a priori _ rule because it requires mere counting of operators .",
    "furthermore , it can be used very efficiently in the context of translation symmetry . because it does not rely on the real - space structure of a term",
    ", it can be applied to all terms in the translation group in contrast to the extended rule .",
    "therefore , for best performance , it turns out to be most efficient to combine both rules in practice .",
