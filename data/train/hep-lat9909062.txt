    "one approach to understanding the physical origin of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking is to attempt to capture the essential physics in a much smaller number of degrees of freedom by projecting from a maximal abelian or maximal center gauge . for simplicity , we consider @xmath0 and denote a link variable transformed by a gauge transformation  @xmath1 by @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "maximal abelian gauge corresponds to calculating @xmath4_{x,\\mu } -1 \\bigr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the abelian projection is performed by truncating @xmath5 and @xmath6 and normalizing to obtain a @xmath7 matrix@xcite .",
    "although results are ambiguous because of gribov ambiguities associated with local minima , the projected results generally reproduce the proper string tension .",
    "maximal center gauge corresponds to calculating @xmath8and center projection is performed by truncating @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath9 and normalizing the resulting @xmath10 variable to @xmath11 .",
    "the properties of center projection have been discussed widely by greensite and collaborators@xcite and reinhardt and collaborators@xcite .",
    "the set of negative links defines a set of center vortices , corresponding to closed lines in three dimensions and closed surfaces in four dimensions .",
    "vortices may also be thought of as dirac strings connecting monopoles .    for subsequent reference , it is useful to visualize a vortex sheet generated by a single negative link in the @xmath12  direction from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the vortex sheet is the surface of the cube dual to this link , that is , the unit cube in @xmath15 centered at the origin and having @xmath16 . if one cuts this four - dimensional surface at time @xmath17 and observes it in the three - dimensional @xmath18 space , it corresponds to a square loop piercing the center of each of the plaquettes with wilson loop  @xmath19 that share the negative-@xmath12 link .",
    "if two adjacent links in the @xmath12  direction are  @xmath19 , the cube grows to a rectangular parallelepiped , and in general surfaces can grow by stacking the dual cubes together .",
    "returning to our single cube dual to a @xmath12  link , we note for example that the @xmath20-@xmath21 surface corresponds to a @xmath22-@xmath12 plaquette and thus corresponds to @xmath23 . in general",
    ", the vortex sheet in the @xmath24 plane corresponds to @xmath25 . by suitably choosing the time direction in euclidean space to either be in or perpendicular to the plane of the sheet",
    ", we can think of the vortex sheets as being sheets of magnetic or electric fields .",
    "hence , a single smoothly bending vortex sheet corresponds locally to either @xmath26 or @xmath27 , but can never generate @xmath28 .",
    "the simplest way to generate lumps of @xmath28 , corresponding to the topological charge density one expects from instantons , is to have an intersection of two mutually perpendicular sheets .",
    "for example , a sheet in the @xmath20-@xmath22 plane at fixed @xmath29 with @xmath30 intersecting a sheet in the @xmath12-@xmath21 plane at fixed @xmath31 with @xmath32 yields a point of @xmath28 at @xmath33 .",
    "if the vortices have finite thickness , the resulting lump of @xmath28 will have finite size .",
    "lattice phenomenology provides several indications that the reduced degrees of freedom subsequent to center projection still embody the essence of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . the contribution of each vortex piercing a wilson loop is @xmath34 , so that a random ensemble of vortices produces confinement and lattice measurements yield the proper string tension and scaling@xcite .",
    "there are several indications that there are underlying physical structures ( `` thick vortices '' ) corresponding to the `` thin vortices '' obtained by projection .",
    "calculations with twisted boundary conditions to prevent decay to the vacuum yield stationary vortex solutions that are exponentially localized in two dimensions and periodic in the other two dimensions@xcite . when the contribution of a lattice gluon configuration to a wilson loop @xmath35 is labeled by the number  @xmath36 of projected vortices that would pierce the loop , one observes that @xmath37 and @xmath38 for large loops@xcite .",
    "this suggests that there is a finite size object in the actual configuration that , when enclosed by a large enough loop , behaves just like an idealized `` thin vortex '' .",
    "in addition , at finite temperature , the vortices appear to become aligned in the time direction , so that they pierce spatial loops yielding an area law .",
    "finally , de  forcrand and delia@xcite have studied the effect of removing center vortices . for each link",
    "@xmath39 one determines @xmath40 by center projection and defines the modified distribution @xmath41 , which projects to the trivial configuration .",
    "not only does one lose confinement , but in addition @xmath42 and the topological charge @xmath43 .",
    "that @xmath43 is understandable , since @xmath44 must be far from  1 somewhere for nontrivial topology and projection leads to the trivial sector .",
    "that @xmath42 implies via the banks cacher relation that the zero modes and thus all the instantons and antiinstantons must also be removed .",
    "to understand how the modified configuration removes instantons , we have studied the center projection of a single instanton on a lattice .",
    "projection yields a cluster of parallel @xmath19 links in the center of the instanton in one common direction that we will call time .",
    "this breaks the euclidean invariance of the instanton , and yields a vortex sheet that is pure  @xmath45 .",
    "the most relevant configurations are a single dual cube , a @xmath46 cube composed of 8 elementary cubes , and a @xmath47 cube composed of 27 elementary cubes .",
    "to see how the modified distribution cancels an instanton , note that there must be a shift in group space of @xmath48 so @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath50 if we assume that the full shift of @xmath48 occurs in a single plaquette for an instanton of size  @xmath51 and assume a spherical sheet of radius  @xmath52 , @xmath53 so that @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "for a cube , @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "hence , if the size of the vortex is @xmath58 , it should cancel  @xmath59 .    the primary technical problem is local minima corresponding to gribov ambiguities .",
    "we start with a cooled instanton on lattices from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , minimize @xmath62\\ ] ] successively on each site by matrix diagonalization , and overrelax by applying @xmath63 with @xmath64 to  @xmath65 .",
    "the local minimum depends upon  @xmath66 .",
    "for example , a regular gauge instanton with @xmath67 on a @xmath60 lattice yields no vortex for @xmath68 and a @xmath46 vortex for @xmath69 .",
    "similarly the initial gauge matters .",
    "a random gauge transformation at @xmath68 yields a @xmath46 vortex whereas the regular gauge does not .",
    "also , going first to lorentz gauge can prevent finding a vortex solution . by exploring a variety of gauges and initial conditions , the @xmath46 vortex emerged as the minimum solution for this case .",
    "as expected from the analytic estimate of @xmath71 , for a vortex size  @xmath52 comparable to  @xmath51 , center projection removes the instantons .",
    "figure  [ jnfig1 ] shows @xmath72 times the topological charge density as a function of distance for a cooled instanton of size @xmath73 , the instanton with a vortex of size @xmath74 removed , and the density after one and two cooling sweeps .",
    "since @xmath75 begins localized on a shell , it takes several cooling sweeps to see that the integral averages to zero .",
    "after more cooling sweeps , the entire density relaxes to zero .",
    "a similar calculation with size @xmath76 cools back to the original instanton with @xmath77 .",
    "with hindsight , we believe this single - instanton example is an unrepresentative special case .",
    "the problem is that the vortex sheet is a pure @xmath45  field .",
    "although when it has the proper area , it can combine with the existing @xmath78  field of the instanton to cancel the original toplogical charge , the vortex sheet by itself has no topological charge and thus fails to represent the essential phyiscs of the original configuration .",
    "as argued above we expect lumps of @xmath79 to arise from intersections of two vortices .",
    "whereas an isolated instanton will not have vortex sheets extending to infinity , it would be natural for vortices to connect neighboring instantons and antiinstantons .",
    "thus , the relevant case to examine is an ensemble of instantons and antiinstantons , and to see whether projection produces intersections with localized instanton - like lumps of @xmath28 . were this to occur , center vortices would succinctly represent the essential physics of both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ."
