    "the study of galaxy distribution on large scales ( @xmath8 mpc ) where density fluctuations are still in the linear regime ( @xmath9 ) has been an important tool in constraining cosmological models .",
    "however , the unknown relationship between the distribution of dark matter and that of luminous objects , usually referred to as galaxy bias , has complicated the extraction of cosmological parameters , especially when we compare results from surveys of different galaxy subpopulations or of varying depths . at small scales ( @xmath10 mpc ) where nonlinear effects become important , detailed studies of galaxy bias can improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution which is still unclear due to the convolution of gravitational evolution and complex astrophysical processes ( e.g. gas cooling , fragmentation , star formation , feedback ) .",
    "this paper attempts to measure the relative galaxy bias over the intermediate scale ( @xmath11 ) mpc , i.e. the weakly nonlinear scale , as we are constrained by low galaxy density at small scales .",
    "several models of galaxy bias have been developed over the past 20 years or so .",
    "the simplest one is to assume galaxies trace the underlying mass in a linear , deterministic way , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the galaxy and matter density perturbation ( or contrast ) field and @xmath15 is the linear bias parameter . in the peaks bias model ( kaiser 1984 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) , the relationship between the correlation function of galaxies and that of the underlying dark matter satisfies @xmath16 , based on statistics of the density peaks in a gaussian random field . on large scales",

    "attempts to understand galaxy bias have also been made in the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) framework where the relationship between the galaxy distribution and the underlying dark matter is encoded in the conditional probability function @xmath18 which gives the number of galaxies of a given type in a halo of virial mass @xmath19 ( jing et al .",

    "there is also a correlation between colour and morphology ( the majority of blue galaxies are late - type galaxies , while red galaxies are mostly early - type galaxies ) , as well as a correlation between colour and luminosity ( red galaxies are systematically more luminous than blue galaxies ) . therefore , galaxy clustering is expected to be dependent on physical properties such as morphology , colour , surface brightness and luminosity . using a total of over @xmath21 galaxies from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , norberg et al .",

    "the imperial iras - fsc redshift catalogue ( iifscz ; wang & rowan - robinson 2008 ) is a recently constructed catalogue containing 60,303 galaxies selected at @xmath28 from the iras fsc .",

    "the inherent assumption is that the lf does not depend on the local density field .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that the lf is dependent on galaxy type which is in turn related to the environment .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the bivariate distribution function of luminosity and position is separable is not strictly valid .",
    "the lf is of fundamental importance in constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "various techniques have been proposed to measure it , such as the maximum - volume estimator @xmath1 ( schmidt 1968 ) and the parametric ( sandage , tammann & yahil 1979 , hereafter sty ) and non - parametric maximum likelihood estimator ( efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ; springel & white 1998 , hereafter sw98 ) . the @xmath1 method assumes a uniform number density throughout the observed volume and therefore is vulnerable to density inhomogeneities present in a survey .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimators have the advantage of being insensitive to any local clustering effect , but lose information on the overall normalisation .",

    "<S> the relation between current star formation rate ( sfr ) in star - forming galaxies and environment is investigated by looking at the the dependence of clustering on infrared luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we found that m82-type actively star - forming galaxies show stronger clustering as infrared luminosity / sfr increases . </S>",
