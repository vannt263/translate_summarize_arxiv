    "globular clusters observed in m31 provide the closest example of a globular cluster system belonging to a large external galaxy . members of this system allow us to trace the star formation history , chemical evolution , kinematics , and mass distribution in different regions of m31 , and are therefore vital to our developing picture of its formation and evolution .",
    "however , very few clusters have been discovered at large distances from m31 , meaning that up until now we do not possess a good sample with which to probe its outer halo .",
    "recently , as part of a major survey of the m31 halo with the isaac newton telescope ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a search for previously unknown globular clusters , at large projected radii ( @xmath11 ) from the center of m31 , has been conducted .",
    "this search has resulted in the discovery of a significant number of new clusters , with @xmath11 between @xmath12 kpc @xcite .",
    "a sample of @xmath13 of these objects has been the subject of deep follow - up imaging using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "preliminary results for four members of the population of luminous , extended clusters of @xcite have recently been described ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in this letter , we present results for the remaining ten clusters , and compare , for the first time , the cluster population of the outer m31 halo to that of the outer milky way halo .",
    "this sample consists of classical ( compact ) globular clusters with projected radii distributed in the range @xmath0 kpc .",
    "only two of these objects are previously recorded ",
    "the remaining eight are new discoveries .",
    "their positions are listed in table [ t : results ] , and presented schematically in fig .",
    "[ f : images ] .",
    "two of the newly - discovered clusters ( gc5 , gc10 ) lie at very large distances from m31 : @xmath14 and @xmath15 kpc , respectively .",
    "these , along with the new cluster of @xcite , which has @xmath16 kpc , are by far the most remote members of m31 s globular cluster system found to date .",
    "of the two previously reported clusters in our sample , one ( gc4 ) was first described by @xcite but discovered independently by @xcite , who labelled it b514 .",
    "this object has additional separate acs imaging @xcite .",
    "the second was observed in the same field as one of our luminous , extended clusters , and appears in the catalogue of @xcite ( cluster 298 - 021 ) .",
    "our observations were obtained with the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) under hst program go 10394 ( p.i .",
    "tanvir ) , at various intervals over the period 2005 may 27  2005 september 17 .",
    "targets were imaged three times in the f606w filter and four times in the f814w filter , with small dithers between subsequent images .",
    "typical total integration times were 1800s in f606w and 3000s in f814w .",
    "each cluster was placed at the centre of either chip 1 or chip 2 on the wfc , to avoid the inter - chip gap . drizzled f606w images of two representative clusters are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : images ] .",
    "details of our photometric reduction procedure are provided in paper i. briefly , we used the dolphot software @xcite , specifically the acs module , to conduct psf - fitting photometry on all images .",
    "output measurements are on the vegamag scale of @xcite .",
    "we used the quality information provided by dolphot to clean the resulting detection lists , selecting only stellar detections , with valid photometry on all input images , global sharpness parameter between @xmath17 and @xmath18 in each filter , and crowding parameter less than @xmath19 in each filter .",
    "field stars are present in all images ; however , their densities are typically sparse since the clusters are at such large projected radii from m31 . to eliminate field star contamination from our cluster colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , we imposed limiting radii from the cluster centers . because of the sparse fields , these radii were typically quite generous ( @xmath20 )",
    "however , two clusters ( gc6 , gc7 ) are set against heavier background fields and hence required smaller limiting radii of @xmath21 .",
    "from the resulting cmds ( see below ) , it is evident that field star contamination is not a significant issue  in all cases the prinicpal cluster sequences are very clearly visible . therefore , a more sophisticated statistical subtraction is not necessary at this stage .",
    "[ f : cmds ] shows cmds for our ten clusters .",
    "the photometry reaches @xmath1 mag below the level of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , to a limiting magnitude of @xmath22 .",
    "all clusters exhibit narrow red - giant branches ( rgbs ) and clearly delineated hbs .",
    "nine of the clusters possess rather steep rgbs , indicating they are metal - poor objects .",
    "many of these clusters also feature hbs extending to the blue , including broadened regions with colours in the range @xmath23 which are suggestive of rr lyrae stars imaged at random phase .",
    "such clusters are old , with ages @xmath2 gyr .",
    "gc7 has a noticeably different cmd from those of the other clusters , with a sharply bending rgb and very stubby red hb , characteristics indicative of a more metal - rich object .",
    "we obtained photometric metallicity estimates using a procedure we previously described and verified in paper i. because our sample covers a very wide spatial area and range in @xmath11 , we could not assume a uniform distance and reddening .",
    "instead , we determined the best - fitting combination of @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for a given cluster by registering the acs / wfc f606w and f814w galactic globular cluster fiducials of @xcite to the appropriate cmd using the f606w level of the hb and the colour of the rgb at the hb level .",
    "a fiducial of the correct @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] closely traces the upper rgb on the cmd when registered in this way , while a fiducial of incorrect @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] deviates on the upper rgb .",
    "the cluster metallicity is estimated by bounding the rgb with a more metal - poor and a more metal - rich fiducial .",
    "we assume _ a priori _ that the main body of m31 has @xmath26 @xcite . for each cluster we registered fiducials using , incrementally , a range @xmath27 mag about this value ( i.e. , a system depth of @xmath28 kpc ) .",
    "at each @xmath24 we used brown et al s transformations to solve for the @xmath25 which aligned the fiducial and cmd hb levels . applying this reddening",
    ", we determined the offset between the color of the fiducial rgb at hb level and that of the cluster cmd .",
    "the best fitting combination of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for a given fiducial was that which minimized this offset . to determine uncertainties in these values we randomly selected ten thousand gaussian deviates about the two hb levels and the rgb colour at hb level ( widths were typically @xmath29 mag and @xmath30 mag , respectively ) and calculated new @xmath25 and @xmath24 for each .",
    "we derived standard random errors from the resulting distributions .",
    "we note that there are possibly additional systematic errors present for our measured @xmath25 values , due to differences in age between the m31 clusters and the fiducial clusters , and the fact that the colour of the rgb at the hb level is mildly age - sensitive . for the majority of clusters ( with the exceptions discussed below )",
    ", these errors would amount at most to @xmath31 mag more than quoted in table [ t : results ] , corresponding to the interval @xmath32 gyr .    fig .",
    "[ f : fids ] shows the fiducial registration , while numerical results are listed in table [ t : results ] .",
    "the derived metallicities reflect those adopted for the reference clusters by @xcite .",
    "our typical measurement uncertainties are @xmath33 dex .",
    "the majority of our clusters are confirmed as metal - poor objects .",
    "five have rgbs well traced by the m92 fiducial ( @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 = -2.14 $ ] ) , and two have rgbs bounded by m92 and ngc 6752 ( @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 = -1.54 $ ] ) .",
    "two more have rgbs matched by the ngc 6752 fiducial . the remaining cluster , gc7 , is more metal - rich , with its rgb matched by 47 tuc ( @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 = -0.70 $ ] ) .",
    "two clusters have previous metallicity measurements .",
    "@xcite derived , photometrically , @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 \\sim -1.8 $ ] for gc4 .",
    "gc6 has a spectroscopic measurement by @xcite , who found @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 = -2.07 \\pm 0.11 $ ] .",
    "both values are in reasonable agreement with our estimates .",
    "we also compared our derived @xmath25 with those from the maps of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sfd ) ( listed in table [ t : results ] ) .",
    "agreement is adequate , although we note a tendency to derive larger @xmath25 than sfd by a few hundredths of a mag  we noticed a similar effect in paper i. adopting the sfd values forces our @xmath24 to be greater by @xmath34 mag per @xmath35 mag difference in @xmath25 ; however the fiducial registration is often noticeably inferior .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to spatial reddening variations on smaller scales than resolved by the sfd maps ( @xmath36 ) , a systematic error introduced by slightly different ages for the m31 and template clusters ( as noted above ) , or to a systematic error in the colour excesses adopted by @xcite for their reference clusters .",
    "most of our derived distance moduli lie close to the canonical value for m31 : @xmath37 ( @xmath38 kpc ) . however , our measurements for gc7 and gc9 suggest these clusters may be closer by @xmath39 kpc and @xmath40 kpc , respectively .",
    "this would render gc7 , in particular , an unusual object , given its @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] . in the milky way ,",
    "there are two prominent globular clusters at unusually large radii for their @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] : ter 7 and pal 12 .",
    "both these clusters are only about @xmath41 the age of the oldest galactic globulars .",
    "if gc7 is similarly young , then fitting the @xcite fiducials is inappropriate .",
    "we note that the cmd of gc7 shows an overdensity of points around @xmath42 and @xmath43 which is not present in the other cluster cmds .",
    "the presence of the main - sequence turn - off in this region , blurred by observational errors , could explain this bulge",
    ". if this is the case , then gc7 may be as young as @xmath44 gyr , based on cmds for lmc and smc clusters . to check our measured @xmath25 and @xmath24 for gc7",
    ", we transformed our photometry to johnson - cousins @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite and matched the fiducials of @xcite and @xcite for ter 7 and pal 12 , respectively .",
    "these objects have comparable @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] to gc7 .",
    "the fiducial fits result in @xmath47 and @xmath48 , much more similar to the quantities observed for our other m31 clusters .",
    "we note that both ter 7 and pal 12 are unambiguously associated with the accreted sagittarius dsph .",
    "gc7 may represent a similar scenario in m31  verification of our measurements would therefore be valuable .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ f : cmds ] and our measured @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] reveals several second parameter clusters .",
    "we defer numerical calculation of hb morphologies until a future paper when tests for completeness and photometric blends can be incorporated .",
    "even so , the second parameter effect is clear for gc5 , which has a red hb but equivalent @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] to gc2 , and ec1 from paper i. similarly , gc8 and gc9 have @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 \\sim -1.54 $ ] ; however they have much redder hbs than comparable galactic globulars ( e.g. , ngc 1904 , 6752 , 7492 ) .",
    "the hbs of these two objects resemble those for many of the m31 clusters with similar @xmath3fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] but smaller @xmath11 observed by @xcite , and second parameter galactic globulars such as pal 14 .    finally , we calculated integrated cluster luminosities by means of aperture photometry centred on the cluster centres .",
    "this technique ensures all light is counted , even in the unresolved cores of the most compact objects . for a given cluster",
    ", we first estimated the sky level using regions away from the cluster , and produced a sky subtracted image . at large projected radii from m31 , we do not have to worry about a significantly spatially variable background .",
    "we then masked any bright background galaxies or foreground stars in the vicinity of the cluster .",
    "next , we measured integrated luminosities using a variety of apertures .",
    "in combination with the cluster cmds , plotting luminosity as a function of aperture radius allowed us to check for field star contamination . for the most remote clusters , where field contamination is extremely sparse , the integrated luminosity quickly reached an asymptotic limit .",
    "for such objects a maximum radius of @xmath49 was more than sufficient . for objects set against more significant fields , contamination manifested in the form of a slowly increasing integrated luminosity with increasing aperture radius ( as well as being visible in the cmd ) .",
    "for these objects , the cluster light always dominates for radii smaller than @xmath21 . beyond this",
    ", we used our plots to estimate the radius at which field star contamination became non - negligible ( @xmath50 ) and integrated only to this limit .",
    "three clusters have @xmath51 , while the remainder have @xmath52 .",
    "we used our summed magnitudes in f606w and f814w to transform the f606w value to johnson @xmath45 @xcite , and then used the relevant @xmath25 and @xmath24 to calculate @xmath53 .",
    "we next re - sampled with smaller apertures to estimate the half - light radius @xmath54 , which we converted to parsecs using our @xmath24 values .",
    "all results are listed in table [ t : results ] .",
    "clusters with @xmath55 have reliable @xmath53  as noted above , the integrations are very close to asymptotic by such radii .",
    "for the three with @xmath51 , we used the profiles of the clusters with negligible field contamination to observe that @xmath53 may be under - estimated by @xmath56 mag .",
    "this level of uncertainty is acceptable for present purposes  it is less even than the uncertainties introduced by application of the derived distance moduli .    with our new sample of remote m31 members , we are , for the first time , in a position to compare the outer globular cluster system of this galaxy with that of our own .",
    "doing so reveals striking differences between the two .",
    "seven galactic globular clusters have @xmath57 kpc ( pyxis ; pal 3 , 4 , and 14 ; am-1 ; eridanus ; and ngc 2419 ) . of these ,",
    "all except ngc 2419 have @xmath10fe@xmath4h@xmath5 \\la -1.3 $ ] , and are sub - luminous ( @xmath58 ) and very extended ( @xmath59 pc ) .",
    "ngc 2419 is one of the most luminous clusters in our galaxy ( @xmath60 ) , and lies in an unusual position on the luminosity vs. size plane .",
    "this has led to some suggestions it may be the remains of an accreted galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our present sample , we have four m31 globulars at @xmath61 kpc .",
    "in contrast with the majority of outer milky way clusters , these objects are very metal - poor ( @xmath62fe@xmath4h@xmath5 \\la -1.8 $ ] ) , compact ( @xmath63 pc ) and very bright ( @xmath64 ) . unlike ngc 2419 , none of the clusters lie in an unusual position on the luminosity vs. size plane , suggesting that they are normal globular clusters .",
    "the new cluster of @xcite , at @xmath16 kpc is also compact and luminous ( @xmath65 ) , while ec4 from paper i , at @xmath66 kpc , is a member of the population of luminous , extended m31 globular clusters which has no galactic analogue .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that we have not observed any very extended , sub - luminous globular clusters in the remote m31 halo ",
    "such objects may well lie below our present survey detection limit .",
    "even so , the above comparison shows that _",
    "m31 clearly possesses an extended system of metal - poor , compact , and very luminous globular clusters which is not seen in the milky way_. the one luminous , metal - poor outer milky way cluster ",
    "ngc 2419  is quite unlike the m31 clusters we have observed ( as described above ) .",
    "furthermore , the outermost m31 globular clusters studied here are considerably more metal - poor than the pressure - supported field halo population at the same radii @xcite , again in contrast to the milky way .",
    "these disparities may well offer important clues to differences in the early formation and evolution of the two galaxies or in their subsequent accretion histories , and as such , it is vital that additional m31 members are sought .",
    "we remark that the present sample has been obtained from a survey of @xmath67 square degrees , roughly 25% of the area contained within a projected radius of 150  kpc of m31 .",
    "a significant number of new clusters may therefore await detection , suggesting that , unlike in the milky way , there may be a relatively large population of luminous , compact globular clusters in the outer m31 halo .",
    "such objects , in addition to their value as globular clusters , are extremely useful as dynamical probes of the mass distribution in m31  work which has previously relied on clusters with @xmath68 kpc and a handful of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we anticipate that our new sample will soon allow improved mass constraints to be determined .",
