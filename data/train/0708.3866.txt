    "this was confirmed by checking that uv - excited tpl signals vanish if the relative delay of the fundamental beams is adjusted or if a uv absorber ( such as a thin glass coverslip ) is placed in the beam path .",
    "for excitation at 3.1 ev , the opa was blocked and the 3.1 ev beam was directed onto the same excitation spot on the sample . for excitation at 5.9 ev , the ti : sapph was tuned to the red and its second harmonic was directly doubled in the same nonlinear crystal .",
    "the resulting shg was weak but sufficiently strong for tpl collection .",
    "the excitation beams were characterized spectrally with a fiber spectrometer ( ocean optics qe65000 ) and their spatial profiles were obtained by directly imaging onto a ccd camera ( roper scientific micromax ) placed at the sample position .    cm determination measurements consisted of alternating acquisitions under weak 3.1 ev and uv excitation .",

    "the above result is further simplified using @xmath109 for @xmath110 since the multiexciton auger decay rates are more than an order of magnitude larger than x decay rates .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath95 as a sum of exponentials is thus given by : @xmath111    the @xmath112 component of @xmath95 is simply proportional to the x radiative rate multiplied by the population of ncs that start in an x state or higher , since mx states eventually decay to the x state .",
    "the bx component has three factors .",
    "it is firstly proportional to the difference of x and bx radiative rates because bx luminescence is partially offset by a dip in x luminescence , as it is still in the process of being populated .",
    "the second factor in the expression for @xmath28 is proportional again to the sum of the initial populations in bx or higher states .",
    "the third term captures the small delaying effect of cascaded decay from the tx . in ncs originally in the tx state , there is a short @xmath113 delay before population of the bx , which then decays normally at a rate @xmath114 .",

    "single _ exponential .",
    "this suggests that the low - quality subpopulation does not contribute to the bx signal within our experiment s time resolution .",
    "rapid bx decay in those ncs could be explained by the same traps or nonradiative mechanisms involved in their fast x decay , but could also be due to auger decay enhancement on rough or defective surfaces , as would be anticipated from theoretical treatments @xcite . for our purposes",
