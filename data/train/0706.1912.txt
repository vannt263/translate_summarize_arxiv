    "the recent calculation of @xcite from near - ir photometry of cepheids gives @xmath13 , for which the authors claim a total uncertainty of less than 3% . while the spatial extent estimate of @xcite gives an optical size of @xmath14 , the observation of carbon stars up to 15@xmath15 from the center by @xcite",

    "the @xmath26 images have also been corrected for fringing effects .",
    "the daophot - ii / allstar and allframe programs @xcite were then used to obtain the instrumental photometry of the resolved stars from the four individual images in each band and for each chip .",

    "in @xmath25 , one standard star field observed during the ic1613 int run was used to determine the transformations between chip 2 and chips 1 and 4 .",
    "the dispersion of these transformations is @xmath10.005 .",
    "then the transformation for the latter chips based on ogle s photometry was used , bringing the chip 2 @xmath25 photometry into the standard system . in @xmath36 ,",
    "chip 2 was calibrated differentially with respect to chip 4 using overlapping images obtained on the iac80 telescope at izaa , tenerife , spain , during a photometrical observing run .",
    "the dispersion at the center of mass is of the order of 0.01 .",

    "signal - to - noise limitations , stellar crowding , blending and starloss , which we can refer to as observational effects , are important error sources and significantly modify the cmd shape and stellar density distribution @xcite . to estimate the observational effects and the completeness of our photometry",
    ", we resorted to artificial stars tests .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description of the procedure and the effects of crowding .",
    "basically , a large number of artificial stars covering the same range in color and magnitude as the observed stars is added to the images using the corresponding psf .",
    "these were placed on the images following a triangular grid in order to avoid crowding between artificial stars themselves and to optimally sample the chip fields .",
    "the photometry is then repeated in the exact same way as was done originally .",
    "a comparison of the input and output artificial - star list gives information about the completeness as a function of magnitude and galactocentric distance .",
    "as the artificial star sample , we took a synthetic cmd produced by iac - star @xcite using the stellar evolution library of @xcite and the bolometric corrections of @xcite .",
    "the sfr was chosen constant between 13  gyr ago and now , while the metallicity range increases from 0.0008 to 0.002 at @xmath37 , to 0.0008 to 0.006 at the present time .",
    "these ranges were chosen wide enough so that they include the actual metallicity of ic1613 . in total , 76630 artificial stars were added in 5 runs in each external chip , and twice as many in the central chip ( # 4 ) where crowding is more important .",
    "figure  [ inj_rec_stars ] presents the injected and recovered cmds for chip 4 .",
    "the broken line indicates the 25% completeness limit , averaged over the galactocentric radius range , obtained from the ratio of recovered to injected stars as a function of magnitude .",
    "figure  [ err ] shows the completeness and error in recovered magnitude as a function of input magnitude for an inner and an outer field .",
    "it is important noticing that , even though the recovered artificial stars were filtered using the same values of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the real stars , _ external _ errors can be as large as @xmath11  magnitude at the faint limit .",
    "the most evident feature of our cmd , fig .",
    "[ cmd ] , is the red giant branch ( rgb ) , composed of low mass stars ( m  @xmath38 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) older than about 1  gyr and burning hydrogen in a thin layer around an inert helium core .",
    "the age - metallicity degeneracy and the presence of the fainter extension of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) in the same region of the cmd makes it difficult to get detailed information about the stars populating it .",
    "however , it is possible to place rough limits in time for given metallicities using theoretical isochrones .",
    "a more detailed determination of the chemical enrichment law ( cel ) using this method , as well as its limitations , is presented in section [ recentstarfomet ] .",
    "+ the presence of a well populated main sequence ( ms ) blueward of @xmath39 and up to @xmath40 indicates very recent star formation ( @xmath4110  myr ) .",
    "+ the stars with @xmath42 and @xmath43 are most likely blue loop ( bl ) stars , highlighting the blue edge of the core he - burning loop , while the red edge ( i.e. , the red supergiant branch , rsg ) , although contaminated by foreground stars , is well defined from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and up to about @xmath46 . these are young and intermediate- to high - mass stars , so they are among the most metal - rich stars in ic1613",
    ". however , this is a poorly understood phase in stellar evolution and the theoretical models still contain large uncertainties owing to the importance of processes such as mass - loss , overshooting and rotation in very massive stars ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bl and rsg actually reach the red clump down to @xmath47 @xcite , but the dispersion at the faint end of our cmd makes it impossible to distinguish them from the rgb stars below @xmath48 .",
    "+ the final extension of the agb , or red - tail @xcite , extends horizontally redward from the rgb tip at @xmath49 .",
    "agbs are shell h- and he - burning stars , of low and intermediate mass and age over about 0.1  gyr .",
    "their relatively large number indicates a possibly important intermediate - age population with relatively high metallicity , which would be compatible with the enhanced sfr between 3 to 6  gyrs ago found by .    because of the wide field of view , the diagram also contains a relatively large number of foreground stars .",
    "most stars with @xmath50 and @xmath51 are probably galactic dwarfs since their number is the same for the middle and bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ 3cmds ] after correcting for the difference in area . more generally , the foreground contamination is rather important for @xmath52 .",
    "although old stars ( @xmath5310  gyr ) are very likely present in the rgb , our cmd is not deep enough to detail the old , low metallicity population as it would if fainter ms stars were observed .",
    "the existence of a _ bona fide _ old population in ic1613 is known thanks to the presence of rr lyrae stars @xcite and cmds from hubble space telescope observations showing core helium burning , horizontal branch stars and the oldest ms turnoffs @xcite .",
    "to characterize the morphology of ic1613 , we plotted the rgb star distribution obtained from our photometry , and convolved the resulting map with a gaussian of @xmath54 using iraf s gauss from the imfilter package .",
    "the result of this process is a smooth map of the stellar density highlighting the morphology of the galaxy .",
    "fitting ellipses to the isodensity contours was done with iraf s isophote routine .    from the best fitted ellipses , where the crowding is low but the star number sufficient",
    ", we find a position angle of 80@xmath55 and an eccentricity @xmath56 0.15 , in good agreement with the values given by ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; * ? ? ?",
    "following the shape of the isopleths , we divided the galaxy into concentric ellipses at small radii ( @xmath4110@xmath59 ) and circles at larger ones that we used for radial star counts and stellar populations gradient analysis . their semi - major axis increases in steps of 100 pixels , corresponding to @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ nb_density ] shows the radial profile of the galaxy constructed from the number of stars in each ellipse after correcting for completeness .",
    "the correction was obtained from the ratio of the number of recovered to injected stars in the artificial star test for each annular region .",
    "the area of the ellipses has been calculated via monte - carlo sampling , carefully taking into account the gaps between the chips as well as the regions around saturated stars when calculating the effective surface . an approximate surface brightness scale , shown on the right - hand side of fig .  [ nb_density ] , was calculated from the stellar density in each ellipse .",
    "the calibration was calculated by comparing the star number with the total , sky subtracted flux for each ellipse then averaged over the radius range for consistency .",
    "an exponential least square fit to this curve between @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the center gives a scale length of @xmath2 ( @xmath63 pc ) and central surface brightness @xmath3 .",
    "the former value is slightly smaller than the @xmath64 pc ( @xmath13@xmath65 ) given by @xcite .",
    "however , a similar larger length is obtained when fitting only the inner @xmath17@xmath15 , as was done by the authors because of the limited depth of their photometry , and omitting the crowding correction .",
    "the profile seems to get steeper at @xmath66 , but this change of slope could be an artifact of the background subtraction and small number statistics .    the large field of view covered by the wfc permits to study the spatial gradients of the stellar population across the galaxy .",
    "ideally , that would give us hints on its formation and evolution .",
    "however , in the case of shallow cmds , the spatial variations of the morphology of the cmd only reflect accurately differences in the sfh over the last several hundred million years .",
    "such variations have been observed in all the known dwarf irregular galaxies through cmd morphology ( e.g. , wlm : @xcite ; ngc 6822 : @xcite ; leo a : @xcite ; phoenix : @xcite ) or distribution of the variable star populations ( e.g. , in phoenix : @xcite ; in leo i : @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ 3cmds ] shows that it is also the case for ic1613 and confirms the difference in relative number of young and old stars found by between their outer hst field and a central field studied earlier by @xcite .",
    "we divided the galaxy into three regions following the morphology of the cmd of each individual ellipse defined above : the inner part of the galaxy where stars younger than about 500  myr are present ( @xmath67 , fig .",
    "[ 3cmds]a ) , the region at intermediate distance with no young star but still a well defined rgb ( @xmath68 , fig .  [ 3cmds]b ) , and the outermost part of our observed field , dominated by foreground stars ( @xmath4 , fig .",
    "[ 3cmds]c ) .",
    "the corresponding spatial limits , as well as the hi contours from @xcite , are displayed over the stellar distribution of the young and old populations in fig .",
    "[ star_distpop ] .",
    "note that the hi contours were shifted by @xmath69 ( + 100 pixels in y ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath71500 pixels in x ) in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the offset between the astrometry of @xcite and @xcite , and adopting the former for the hi contours correctly places the hii regions of @xcite on top of the star forming regions , and fits our star distribution better . although the rgb of fig .",
    "[ 3cmds]c is not clearly defined , a substantial fraction of the displayed stars probably belong to ic1613 .",
    "this corroborates the results of @xcite , who found carbon stars extending up to @xmath62 from the center of the galaxy , and shows that ic1613 is actually more extended than previously thought .    to give a quantitative measure of the gradient in the age composition of the stars in ic1613 ,",
    "the stellar surface density for different populations of resolved stars is presented in fig .",
    "[ pop_densities ] .",
    "the age gradient is clearly visible : while the density of the older stars follows the expected exponential decrease from the central region , that of the young population peaks at a radius of @xmath13@xmath15 and vanishes rapidly as the radius increases .",
    "this results in the scale length of the young population being much smaller than that of the older stars : a fit to the profiles between @xmath72 and @xmath73 from the center of ic1613 gives scale lengths of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the ms , bl+rsg , agb and rgb , respectively .",
    "the off - centered peak in the distribution of the young population , visible at @xmath78@xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ pop_densities ] , is due to the fact that the star forming regions are distributed in a somewhat circular pattern at this distance from the center @xcite , where @xcite observed a higher h i column - density .     +    because of the large dependence of the rgb color on metallicity",
    ", the position of the rgb in a cmd can be used to estimate the metallicity of the stellar system using empirical relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the same reason , the width of the rgb is often considered to be an indication of the metallicity dispersion . on the cmds presented in fig .",
    "[ 3cmds ] , it appears that the rgb in the central region is wider than that at larger radii and suggests the existence of a metallicity gradient .",
    "however , a rgb width gradient may also reflect an observational - effects gradient . to check this possibility ,",
    "the following procedure was used , including measurements of real- and artificial - star rgb width and error estimates .",
    "we measured the width of the rgb at @xmath79 as a function of galactocentric distance for the real stars as follows : for each radius interval , chosen so that the rgb contains about 800 stars , a subsample of 450 rgb stars was selected at random .",
    "the resulting rgb was sliced in intervals of 0.25 magnitude between @xmath80 , and the width of the rgb in each magnitude range was obtained from the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a gaussian fit to the color function ( cf ) .",
    "the width at @xmath79 was then interpolated from a linear fit to the fwhm versus magnitude plot .",
    "we repeated this operation twenty times using a different subsample of rgb stars each time , and used the dispersion of these solutions as the errorbars .",
    "the same process was followed for the synthetic cmd used in the artificial stars tests , except that the radius bins and random subsamples contained 2500 and 1500 stars , respectively .",
    "the resulting plot is presented in fig .",
    "[ rgbwidth ] for ic1613 ( _ top _ ) and the artificial stars ( _ middle panel _ ) .",
    "it shows that the rgb recovered in the artificial star tests is wider in the center of the galaxy .",
    "in addition to the expected fwhm widening due to signal - to - noise limitations , crowding in the central part further disperses the stars on the cmd .",
    "crowding is important and affects the width of the rgb up to @xmath81 . to correct the observed rgb for the effects of crowding , we calculated the broadening parameter as a function of radius by subtracting in quadrature the injected width from the recovered one .",
    "the corrected width was then obtained by subtracting in quadrature the broadening parameter from the observed rgb width , and is shown as the thick red line in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ rgbwidth ] .",
    "the fwhm of the corrected rgb still presents a significant variation across the central @xmath16@xmath15 .",
    "a higher metallicity dispersion in the central region could be responsible for this residual width excess .",
    "however , the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ rgbwidth ] , showing the width of artificial rgbs for which the age of the youngest stars is progressively older , indicates that this excess is consistent with the presence of stars between 1 and 34 gyr old in the center .",
    "thus , there is no strong evidence of a metallicity gradient across the galaxy but its presence can not be ruled out with the present set of data .",
    "the reconstruction of the recent sfh has been performed in a way similar to that described in hidalgo & aparicio ( 2007 , in preparation ) or @xcite .",
    "the main difference here resides in the fact that our cmd is not sufficiently deep to contain discriminating information about intermediate - age and old stars .",
    "we limited our study to the recent sfh , i.e. , the last @xmath1300  myr , based on the ms , bl and rsg populations .",
    "it thus limited the determination of the sfh to the inner r  @xmath82 since these populations are absent beyond this radius .    in short ,",
    "the sfh is derived from the comparison of the star distribution of the observed cmd with that of a synthetic cmd .",
    "the synthetic cmd to be used in the comparison needs to cover a range of age and metallicity at least as large as the one that can be expected in such a dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "it was generated by iac - star @xcite using the stellar evolution library of @xcite and the bolometric corrections from @xcite , with the following parameters : the sfr was chosen constant between 13  gyr ago and now , the initial mass function ( imf ) was that of @xcite , and the fraction of binaries was set to zero .",
    "to fix the input cel we fitted isochrones of different metallicities to the upper rgb of the outer field where crowding is not dominant .",
    "we used the @xcite isochrones for different ages ( 1.585 , 2.239 , 5.012 , 10.00 and 12.59  gyr old ) and metallicities between @xmath83 and @xmath84 in steps of 0.0005 .",
    "the metallicities that are not available in the original library were interpolated using iac - star .",
    "a metallicity was considered valid at a given age if the corresponding isochrone was inside the fwhm of the rgb between @xmath85 .",
    "figure  [ cel ] ( _ filled diamonds _ ) shows the values obtained through this method .",
    "although the method is rather simplistic , our resulting cel is in very good agreement with those derived by .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the theoretical isochrones are generally too vertical with respect to the empirical ones , leading to a slight overestimation of the metallicity .",
    "the grayed region represents the metallicity range employed to create the comparison cmd .",
    "it is mainly used for producing the rgb , from which we obtain the mean sfr between 1500 and 13000  myr , and serves a normalization purpose for the young sfh . for the stars",
    "younger than 300  myr , we tried to put constraints on their metallicity by further restricting the metallicity range in the comparison cmd to intervals of 0.002 in abundance by mass , and ran the algorithm three times with the following ranges : @xmath86  0.0015 - 0.0035 , @xmath86  0.0025 - 0.0045 and @xmath86  0.0035 - 0.0055 .    in order to simulate the observational effects and allow a more realistic comparison with the real cmd",
    ", we applied the dispersion in color and magnitude of the synthetic stars recovered from the crowding tests to the comparison cmd , following the same procedure as in @xcite .    in the observed and comparison cmds , the ms , bl and rsg sequence",
    "are then divided into ` boxes ' . because the box selection could influence the resulting sfh , we used three different types of box to rule out this possibility : two regular grids with large ( 0.3 and 0.5 in color and magnitude , respectively ) and small ( 0.2 and 0.3 ) box size , and an ``  la carte '' parametrization . in the latter , the size and shape of the boxes",
    "are chosen taking into account the knowledge and model limitations of the evolutionary phases , in particular the slope of the rsg sequence and the position of the bl .",
    "the regular grids were also shifted in color and magnitude to check for consistency and ensure the significance of the result .    additionally , the synthetic stars are divided into partial models , each with a small range in age .",
    "the temporal resolution is limited by the quantity of information contained in the cmd , which depends on the quality of the data .",

    "the consistency of the method was checked by solving the sfh of synthetic cmds and comparing the solutions with the input sfhs .",
