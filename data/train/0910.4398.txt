    "supermassive stars were proposed by hoyle & fowler ( 1963a , b ) as a means to meet the prodigious energy requirements of radio galaxies ( burbidge 1958 ) , and slightly later as a model for quasars .",
    "hoyle & fowler recognized that such objects could not persist for much more than a million years , if sustained by hydrogen burning , and suggested that they might collapse to form black holes once their nuclear fuel was exhausted .",
    "the pulsational stability of supermassive stars is a crucial issue , because they are radiation pressure - dominated and therefore have an adiabatic index very close to @xmath8 ( which yields neutral stability to radial pulsations for a newtonian , self - gravitating body with no rotation ) .",
    "small general relativistic corrections have a destabilizing effect , preventing nonrotating stars more massive than a few @xmath9 from attaining a phase of stable hydrogen burning before collapsing ( iben 1963 ; fowler 1964 ) .",
    "however , a dynamically insignificant level of rotation  especially differential rotation  can stabilize stars as massive as @xmath10 or more ( fowler 1966 ) .",
    "additional stabilizing effects due to magnetic fields and turbulence were later considered by other authors ( e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1967 ; ozernoy & usov 1971 ) .    in this paper , we are interested in whether stable supermassive stars might be precursors of seed black holes that eventually grow to large enough mass to power quasars and populate the nuclei of present - day massive galaxies . as we will argue in",
    "  5 , the holes created inside a supermassive star are likely to have masses of a few percent of the star s final mass .",
    "thus , to obtain seed black holes with masses @xmath7 , comfortably larger than the seeds probably left behind by the collapse of population iii stars , we need to consider supermassive stars with masses @xmath0 . we will focus on this mass range in our analysis .",
    "( fuller , woosley & weaver 1986 ) . ]",
    "once the existence of a stable supermassive star is postulated , its structure would appear to be quite simple . in order for",
    "radiation pressure to support the star against gravity , the radiative flux seen by every element of mass in the star must equal the _ local _ eddington limit , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the local opacity and @xmath5 is the mass enclosed within @xmath6 .",
    "the opacity inside a supermassive star is likely to be roughly uniform , with electron scattering dominant everywhere , but @xmath5 is a monotonic function of radius .",
    "since the entire luminosity is produced by thermonuclear reactions within a small region of the core , the star must be highly convective with the fraction of the total luminosity carried by convection varying as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total mass of the star .",
    "if the convection is efficient , then a supermassive star should be described accurately by an @xmath3 ( @xmath15 ) polytrope , according to the lane - emden equation .",
    "such models , however , beg the question of how a supermassive star might realistically form .",
    "creating a @xmath16 star requires the very rapid accumulation of gas .",
    "since the thermonuclear timescale for a star burning hydrogen at the eddington limit is @xmath17 myr , independent of mass , and will be less if only part of the fuel is burned , the infall rate required to create a supermassive star of mass @xmath14 must exceed @xmath18 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is orders of magnitude larger than the rate at which matter condenses to form normal stars within molecular clouds , or even the rate ( @xmath19 yr@xmath2 ) at which matter came together to form pop iii stars in pregalactic dark matter halos .",
    "the maximum rate at which matter can collect is given by @xmath20 yr@xmath2 , under the assumption that the gas is self - gravitating and collapses at its free - fall speed @xmath21 . in effect , this means that supermassive stars can only form in systems with virial temperatures exceeding @xmath22 k. there is considerable controversy over whether such high rates of inflow can occur without most of the gas fragmenting and forming stars before reaching the center .",
    "despite early suggestions that fragmentation is avoidable only if the gas temperature remains close to the virial temperature ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; begelman , volonteri & rees 2006 )  and thus only in systems lacking both metals and molecular hydrogen  recent simulations suggest that fragmentation may be suppressed even when the gas is much colder ( wise , turk & abel 2008 ; levine et al .",
    "2008 ; regan & haehnelt 2009 ) , possibly due to the continuous generation of supersonic turbulence ( begelman & shlosman 2009 ) .    conditions of rapid infall are ideal for producing the high levels of entropy required inside supermassive stars .",
    "indeed , simple estimates show that the initial entropy of the gas joining the star can be much larger than the value required for equilibrium .",
    "we argue that the nature of radiation - pressure support provides a mechanism for automatically regulating the entropy of the gas joining the supermassive star , so that it is neither too large nor too small .",
    "this is due to the existence of a  trapping radius \" within the infalling gas , outside of which radiative diffusion can release excess entropy .",
    "gas with too much entropy will be forced to expand until it gives up the excess .",
    "however , this does _ not _ imply that supermassive stars should have uniform specific entropy and therefore resemble polytropes .",
    "in this paper we study the evolution and fate of supermassive under the assumption that they grow by rapid , continuous infall . in    2 and 3 ,",
    "we argue that gas joins the star with increasing specific entropy as a function of time .",
    "since the kelvin - helmholtz timescale is longer than the age of the star for early times and high infall rates , much of this this entropy stratification is preserved over the life of the star .",
    "we therefore conclude that supermassive stars are not necessarily well - represented by @xmath3 polytropes , but rather can have a more complex structure with a convective ( polytropic ) core surrounded by a convectively stable envelope that contains most of the mass .",
    "the entropy in the envelope roughly satisfies @xmath23 ( we term this entropy law  hylotropic \" ) .",
    "hydrogen burning in the core starts when the star s mass and entropy are both relatively low , and adjusts to sustain the star through its more massive stages (   4 ) .    in   5 , we discuss the formation of the seed black hole after the exhaustion of core hydrogen , and its subsequent growth inside the remnant of the supermassive star . because of the likely importance of rotation in the collapsing core , only a small fraction of the supermassive star collapses to a black hole initially .",
    "the energy liberated during the formation of the black hole inflates the remainder of the star into a bloated object that resembles a red giant , which we have previously termed a  quasistar \" ( begelman et al .",
    "2006 ; begelman , rossi & armitage 2008 ) . the black hole continues to grow by accretion from the quasistar envelope , until the photospheric temperature drops to the point where the quasistar undergoes an  opacity crisis \" and disperses under the influence of radiation pressure .",
    "we summarize our results in ",
    "6 and comment on the possible contribution of supermassive stars to the ionizing radiation field at high redshifts .",
    "a thermally relaxed supermassive star must be fully convective and therefore well - represented by an @xmath3 ( @xmath15 ) polytrope ( hoyle & fowler 1963a ) .",
    "the structure is determined by the solution , @xmath24 , of the lane - emden equation : @xmath25 with boundary conditions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radius normalized to @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the central pressure and density , respectively , with the pressure and density elsewhere being given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "density is related to pressure via an entropy parameter @xmath34 , which depends uniquely on the mass of the star : @xmath35 .",
    "the dimensionless radius of the star is given by @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 k is the central temperature .",
    "rather than assuming that the star simply exists with a fixed mass , we assume that the star s mass is growing at a rate @xmath40 yr@xmath2 , so that @xmath41 .",
    "given the growth rate of the star , we can assess whether the star is thermally relaxed by comparing @xmath42 to the  trapping radius , \" @xmath43 , which separates the outer region where the infalling gas leaks radiation , from the inner region where the flow is approximately adiabatic ( begelman 1978 ) .",
    "for electron scattering opacity with @xmath44 @xmath45 g , we have @xmath46 suppose @xmath42 lies inside the trapping radius .",
    "in this case , the infalling gas must already be adiabatic by the time it joins the star .",
    "this is problematic , because the specific entropy of the gas in an @xmath3 polytrope ( as measured , e.g. , by @xmath47 ) is uniquely determined by the mass .",
    "matter about to join the star will generally have much higher entropy than the required value .",
    "( this can be ascertained , in a specific case , by comparing the ram pressure with the density of gas in free fall  but it would be true in most circumstances . ) therefore , infalling matter _ must _ lose entropy in order to join a polytropic star .",
    "but if @xmath48 , the gas behaves adiabatically near the star and such entropy loss is impossible . in this case",
    "the star can not be thermally relaxed .",
    "on the other hand , thermal relaxation is possible if @xmath49 .    comparing equations ( [ polyradius ] ) and ( [ rtrap ] )",
    ", we see that supermassive stars of a given mass can become thermally relaxed only after a certain amount of time has passed , @xmath50 or equivalently , for a given accretion rate , if @xmath51 .",
    "the  main sequence \" lifetime for a fully convective star is @xmath52 myr , where we have assumed a hydrogen mass fraction @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that no star more massive than @xmath54 can be thermally relaxed during its lifetime .",
    "if matter falling onto a growing supermassive star has the  wrong \" entropy to maintain a polytrope , what kind of structure results ?",
    "it appears that the acquisition of entropy can be a self - regulating process .",
    "if gas with too much entropy per unit mass is added to an @xmath3 polytrope , for example , the star will expand to the point where its radius exceeds the trapping radius and it can radiate away the excess entropy . if , conversely , gas with too little entropy is added to the polytrope , the star will shrink until thermonuclear reactions increase the entropy in the interior . since a supermassive star is built up by adding gas with ",
    "too much \" entropy , this implies that the radius of a supermassive star is of order the trapping radius associated with the infall rate . for constant @xmath55 ,",
    "the radius of a supermassive star is independent of mass .",
    "this is impossible if the entropy is uniform throughout the star ( that would be a polytrope , with @xmath56 ) , but it is possible if the specific entropy increases with radius .    at each stage in the star s growth , the entropy of the newly - added gas adjusts to the  correct \" value for the star s current mass . as more matter is added , the earlier layers are squeezed to smaller radii , and their entropies are frozen in . from the homology scalings @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which must be satisfied for each layer of mass , we see that the entropy must be an increasing function of enclosed mass , @xmath59 .",
    "since mass increases with radius , this implies that the envelopes of unrelaxed stars are stable to convection .",
    "we now construct quantitative models for these unrelaxed envelopes , and show how they can be matched to convective cores . because the equation of state depends explicitly on the enclosed mass , it is convenient to use lagrangian variables . assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , the equations are : @xmath60 @xmath61 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath62 , to which we add the equation of state @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a constant .      equation ( [ eossms ] ) is a special case of a more general class of equations of state of the form @xmath65 because of the dependence on mass , we propose to call such equations of state _ hylotropic _ and the derived structures _ hylotropes _ ( from gk .",

    "since the collapsing gas within any mass shell is strongly self - gravitating , angular momentum transport can be driven efficiently by global gravitational torques and turbulence resulting from nonaxisymmetric gravitational instabilities , as discussed in begelman et al .",
    "( 2006 )  although magnetic torques could also be important .    the transport of angular momentum outward is unavoidably accompanied by the outward transport of energy ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "an unknown fraction of this liberated energy might escape the system via a jet punching through the star ( as in the collapsar model of gamma - ray bursts ) .",
    "neutrino losses might also be important , particularly when the black hole mass is small .",
    "the remainder of the energy must pass through the star on its way out , presumably driving a strong convective flux through the outer core and surrounding envelope ( blandford & begelman 2004 ) . in associating the convective luminosity with the rate of black hole growth , @xmath212",
    ", we fold in these possible inefficiencies through the factor @xmath213 .",
    "we recognize the standard efficiency of black hole accretion by using the normalization @xmath214 , with the understanding that @xmath215 might be @xmath216 .",
    "initially , the liberated energy flux is trapped in the star , causing it to inflate .",
    "as we show below , this happens so quickly that @xmath14 can be taken to be constant during this process . since @xmath217 for a radiation - dominated , convective body , the core temperature drops rapidly as the star expands , as does the total binding energy .",
    "an upper limit to the energy that can be absorbed without dispersing the star is the initial binding energy , @xmath218 ( neglecting general relativistic corrections ) . for a fully convective star , @xmath219 erg while @xmath220 erg , where @xmath221 is the",
    " potential energy - weighted \" mean rotation parameter @xmath222 .",
    "this leads to a maximum  seed \" black hole mass that can grow during the intial expansion phase : @xmath223 the estimate of @xmath224 ( and thus @xmath225 ) is easily generalized to the case where the supermassive star is not fully convective when the black hole starts to grow .    to estimate the timescale for this initial growth , we apply the modified bondi accretion model described in begalman et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "because the accretion radius of the seed black hole is small compared to the radius of the star , we can use the central pressure and density as approximate outer boundary conditions for the flow .",
    "the standard bondi ( 1952 ) formula for the accretion rate is reduced by a factor @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the adiabatic sound speed outside the accretion radius .",
    "this factor is necessary to ensure that the convective flux escaping from the accretion flow does not exceed the saturated value @xmath228 ( gruzinov 1998 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; narayan , igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) . for a black hole mass of @xmath229 , the growth time",
    "is @xmath230 implying that a black hole of modest initial mass will quickly grow to @xmath225 .",
    "the growth of the black hole can not completely disrupt the star , because this would interrupt the fuel supply and stop accretion .",
    "once the black hole reaches a mass @xmath225 , the convective envelope expands at approximately constant mass , in response to the black hole power @xmath231 the star continues to expand as long as @xmath232 exceeds the eddington limit for the star , @xmath233 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "once the limit is reach , the black hole  star system should come into a kind of equilibrium that we have dubbed a  quasistar \"  a bloated convective envelope powered by black hole accretion at the center .      as discussed in previous publications ( begelman et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) , under suitable initial conditions a black hole can grow rapidly and by a large factor inside a quasistar .",
    "the growth occurs at a highly super - eddington rate ( i.e. , with mass e - folding in much less than the salpeter time , @xmath234 myr ) because the accretion power of the black hole is regulated at the eddington limit corresponding to @xmath14 , which is much larger than @xmath235 .",
    "the main requirement for stable growth is that the ratio of black - hole to envelope mass be smaller than @xmath185 ( with some dependence on envelope abundances , via the opacity ) ; otherwise the effective temperature becomes so low that the envelope can not radiate away the flux , and it disperses .",
    "we refer readers to begelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for detailed discussion of quasistar structure and evolution .    to calculate the co - evolution of the black hole and quasistar",
    ", we apply the model described in section 4 of begelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , with the two feedback efficiency parameters , @xmath197 and @xmath213 , set equal for simplicity . integrating eq .",
    "( 51 ) of begelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and using the quasistar mass as the independent variable rather than time , we obtain @xmath236 where @xmath237 $ ] is the initial mass of the quasistar in units of @xmath16 , from eq .",
    "( [ masscore4 ] ) .    from eq .",
    "( 11 ) of begelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( with parameters set to their fiducial values ) , the effective temperature of the quasistar s photosphere ( in units of @xmath238 k ) is given by @xmath239 which decreases with time as the black hole and quasistar grow ( begelman et al .",
    "the quasistar disperses and black hole growth stops when @xmath240 reaches @xmath241 k. in contrast to a contracting protostar or red giant envelope which manages to maintain dynamical equilibrium while evolving at close to the minimum effective temperature ( the  hayashi track \" ) , the quasistar loses equilibrium and disperses at this point because of the nature of the black hole energy source as well as the fact that it is supported by radiation pressure rather than gas pressure .",
    "this behavior is discussed at length in begelman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "given the estimates above for @xmath225 and @xmath242 , it is clear that the black hole is generally able grow by a large factor before the quasistar disperses . assuming that the final black hole mass , @xmath243 is much larger than @xmath244 , we find @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the final mass of the quasistar . for modest accretion rates",
    "@xmath247 , the quasistar does not grow much between its formation and dispersal , @xmath248 , and for @xmath249 the black hole left behind when the quasistar disperses has a mass in the range @xmath250 .",
    "but for @xmath251 , the final quasistar mass is considerably larger , @xmath252 and the final black hole mass is @xmath253 .",
    "we have revisited the theory of supermassive stars , taking into account the fact that their short nuclear burning timescales ( @xmath254 myr ) imply that the matter forming them must accumulate rapidly . if the accumulation of matter is rapid enough ( typically , more than a few solar masses per year ) , then the star never has time to become thermally relaxed and fully convective . instead , its structure consists of a convective core containing a minority of the mass and occupying a small fraction of the stellar volume , surrounded by a convectively stable envelope with the specific entropy increasing outward as enclosed mass to the 2/3 power .",
    "we have calculated the structures of these envelopes  for which we propose the term  hylotropes \" ( following a suggestion by a.  accardi and g.  lodato )  and the conditions for matching them to the convective cores , and have thus devised a theory for the evolution of partially convective supermassive stars .",
    "partially convective supermassive stars are strikingly different from their fully convective counterparts ( described by @xmath3 polytropes ) in a number of respects .",
    "they do not follow the same mass - radius relation as fully convective stars . instead of the scaling @xmath255 , which applies for a fully convective supermassive star with a central temperature regulated by thermonuclear reactions ,",
    "our partially convective models have a radius proportional to the ( assumed constant ) accretion rate .",
    "physically , the stellar radius is comparable to the  trapping radius \" within which radiation is unable to escape inward advection by the accumulating gas ( begelman 1978 , 1979 ) .",
    "also , their nuclear - burning (  main sequence \" ) lifetimes can be shorter because the fuel in the convectively stable envelope is never mixed into the core .",
    "hydrogen - burning supermassive stars in the mass range considered here ( @xmath0 ) can exist only if stabilized by rotation or some other  stiff \" form of energy ( such as magnetic fields or turbulence ) ( fowler 1964 , 1966 ) .",
    "the minimal level of rotation required to cancel the general - relativistic instability is not dynamically significant .",
    "however , the angular momentum may well be high enough to inhibit the formation of the black hole , once the core runs out of hydrogen and collapses .",
    "we have argued that the initial mass of the seed black hole , if limited by the energy released in forming it , may be as small as a few hundred solar masses  i.e. , only @xmath256 of the total stellar mass .",
    "however , there is likely to be a second phase of rapid black hole growth once the inflated stellar envelope reaches equilibrium as a red giant - like quasistar .",
    "we therefore estimate that supermassive stars should leave behind black holes with typical masses of a few percent that of the star , i.e. , roughly @xmath257 .",
    "these estimates are admittedly quite uncertain , mainly because we do not understand how energy liberated by black hole accretion couples to the remainder of the star .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that most of the energy punches through the star in a pair of jets ( in a fashion similar to the collapsar model of gamma - ray bursts [ woosley 1993 ] ) , in which case both the seed and final black hole masses could be much larger .",
    "we note that while our estimate of the initial black hole mass is qualitatively similar to values ( few tens of @xmath258 ) predicted by begelman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , our new value for the predicted envelope mass at the time of black hole formation is 23 orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that begelman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) failed to account for the rapid growth of the convective core due to heating by efficient thermonuclear reactions in the cno cycle .",
    "( effectively , we considered pure pop iii abundances , for which thermonuclear energy release is too weak to stall the formation of the seed hole . )",
    "supermassive stars can be strong sources of far - uv radiation , provided that their spectra are not severely degraded by reprocessing at radii beyond @xmath43 .",
    "taking the photospheric radius to be @xmath259 , we find an effective temperature @xmath260 k for a partially convective star of mass @xmath14 , corresponding to @xmath261 k at the end of hydrogen - burning .",
    "however , the infalling gas joining a supermassive star is already very optically thick at @xmath43 ( @xmath262 , where @xmath21 is the infall speed ) , implying that most of the radiation escapes from further out and is likely to be softer . on the other hand ,",
    "the opacity is strongly scattering - dominated , so the color temperature could be several times higher than the effective temperature .",
    "the hardest radiation is likely to escape from the polar regions , where rotational effects decrease the density .    assuming a blackbody spectrum with the effective temperature estimated above and @xmath263",
    ", we find that most of the radiation is capable of ionizing hydrogen ( @xmath264 ev ) , with an ionizing luminosity @xmath265 erg s@xmath2 and photon flux @xmath266 s@xmath2 .",
    "the star radiates into the lyman ",
    "werner band ( @xmath267 ev ) , capable of dissociating h@xmath268 , with @xmath269 erg s@xmath2 and @xmath270 s@xmath2 . to produce an interesting mean intensity of dissociating radiation",
