    "in this paper , we will consider a _",
    "shot noise process _ which is a real - valued random process given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a given ( deterministic ) measurable function ( it will be called the _ kernel function _ of the shot noise process ) , the @xmath2 are the points of a poisson point process on the line of intensity @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a positive @xmath6-finite measure on  @xmath7 and the @xmath8 are independent copies of a random variable @xmath9 ( called the _ impulse _ ) , independent of @xmath10 .",
    "shot noise processes are related to many problems in physics as they result from the superposition of `` shot effects '' which occur at random .",
    "fundamental results were obtained by rice  @xcite .",
    "daley @xcite gave sufficient conditions on the kernel function to ensure the convergence of the formal series in a preliminary work .",
    "general results , including sample paths properties , were given by rosiski @xcite in a more general setting .",
    "in most of the literature the measure @xmath5 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath7 such that the shot noise process is a stationary one . in order to derive more precise sample paths properties and",
    "especially crossings rates , mainly two properties have been extensively exhibited and used .",
    "the first one is the markov property , which is valid , choosing a noncontinuous positive causal kernel function , that is , @xmath11 for negative time .",
    "this is the case , in particular , of the exponential kernel @xmath12 for which explicit distributions and crossings rates can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "a simple formula for the expected numbers of level crossings is valid for more general kernels of this type but resulting shot noise processes are nondifferentiable  @xcite .",
    "the infinitely divisible property is the second main tool .",
    "actually , this allows us to establish convergence to a gaussian process as the intensity increases  @xcite .",
    "sample paths properties of gaussian processes have been extensively studied and fine results are known concerning the level crossings of smooth gaussian processes ( see  @xcite , e.g. ) .    the goal of the paper is to study the crossings of a shot noise process in the general case when the kernel function @xmath1 is smooth . in this setting",
    "we lose markov s property but the shot noise process inherits smoothness properties .",
    "integral formulas for the number of level crossings of smooth processes was generalized to the non - gaussian case by  @xcite but it uses assumptions that rely on properties of some densities , which may not be valid for shot noise processes .",
    "we derive integral formulas for the mean number of crossings function and pay a special interest in the continuity of this function with respect to the level . exploiting further on normal convergence , we exhibit a gaussian regime for the mean number of crossings function when the intensity goes to infinity",
    ". a particular example , which is studied in detail , concerns the shot noise process where @xmath13 almost surely and @xmath1 is a gaussian kernel of width @xmath6 , @xmath14 such a model has many applications because it is solution of the heat equation ( we consider @xmath6 as a variable ) , and it thus models a diffusion from random sources ( the points of the poisson point process ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ crossingssec ]",
    ", we consider crossings for general smooth processes .",
    "we give an explicit formula for the fourier transform of the mean number of crossings function of a process @xmath15 in terms of the characteristic function of @xmath16 .",
    "one of the difficulties is then to obtain results for the mean number of crossings of a given level @xmath17 and not only for almost every @xmath17 .",
    "thus we focus on the continuity property of the mean number of crossings function .",
    "section  [ crosssn ] is devoted to crossings for a smooth shot noise process @xmath15 defined by ( [ sn1deq ] ) . in order to get the continuity of the mean number of crossings function , we study the question of the existence and the boundedness of a probability density for @xmath18 . in section  [ highintensitysec ] ,",
    "we show how , and in which sense , the mean number of crossings function converges to the one of a gaussian process when the intensity @xmath19 goes to infinity .",
    "we give rates of this convergence .",
    "finally , in section  [ gaussiankernel ] , we study in detail the case of a gaussian kernel of width @xmath6 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the mean number of local extrema of this process , as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "thanks to the heat equation , and also to scaling properties between @xmath6 and @xmath19 , we prove that the mean number of local extrema is a decreasing function of @xmath6 , and give its asymptotics as @xmath6 is small or large .",
    "the goal of this section is to investigate crossings of general smooth processes in order to get results for smooth shot noise processes .",
    "this is a very different situation from the one studied in [ @xcite , @xcite ] where shot noise processes are nondifferentiable .",
    "however , crossings of smooth processes have been extensively studied , especially in the gaussian processes realm ( see  @xcite , e.g. ) which are second order processes . therefore ,",
    "in the whole section , we will consider second order processes which are both almost surely and mean square continuously differentiable ( see  @xcite , section 2.2 , e.g. ) .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the derivatives are also second order processes .",
    "moreover , most of known results on crossings are based on assumptions on density probabilities , which are not well adapted for shot noise processes . in this section ,",
    "we revisit these results with a more adapted point of view based on characteristic functions .    when @xmath15 is an almost surely continuously differentiable process on @xmath7",
    ", we can consider its multiplicity function on an interval @xmath20 $ ] defined by @xmath21)=\\#\\{t\\in [ a , b ] ;    x(t)=\\alpha\\}.\\ ] ] this defines a positive random process taking integer values .",
    "let us briefly recall some points of `` vocabulary . '' for a given level @xmath22 , a point @xmath23 $ ] such that @xmath24 is called `` crossing '' of the level @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath25)$ ] counts the number of crossings of the level @xmath17 in the interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "now we have to distinguish three different types of crossings ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) : the up - crossings that are points for which @xmath24 and @xmath26 , the down - crossings that are points for which @xmath24 and @xmath27 and the tangencies that are points for which @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",

    "dealing with random processes , one may be more interested in the mean number of crossings",

    "when , moreover , @xmath15 is a stationary process , by the additivity of means , we get @xmath34)=(b - a)c_x ( \\alpha , [ 0,1])$ ] for @xmath22 . in this case @xmath35)$ ] corresponds to the mean number of crossings of the level @xmath17 per unit length .",

    "( see  @xcite , e.g. ) .",
    "one way to obtain results on crossings for almost every level @xmath17 is to use the well - known _ co - area formula _ which is , in fact , valid in the more general framework of bounded variations functions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
