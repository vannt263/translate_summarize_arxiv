    "this is theoretically equivalent to abruptly rotating the field @xmath11 by the angle @xmath16 while keeping the trap unperturbed : @xmath17 the subsequent evolution of @xmath11 is given by the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation .",

    "analytically , one then easily finds the zero - frequency mode for arbitrary @xmath0 : @xmath43    why is there such a zero - frequency mode in the classical hydrodynamics ?",
    "we have found that this is because there a continuous branch of stationary solutions of the classical hydrodynamics equations parametrized by two real numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 these real numbers are not independent since they have to satisfy @xmath48 this is a second degree equation for @xmath45 at a given @xmath44 so it can be solved explicitly , giving rise to two branches .",

    "consider a stationary solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation with a vortex lattice present , in the case of an isotropic trap , @xmath2 .",
    "this solution clearly breaks the rotational symmetry so(2 ) of the hamiltonian .",
    "since this is a continuous symmetry group , goldstone s theorem guarantees us the existence of a degree of freedom behaving as a massive boson @xcite .",
    "in particular , this implies the existence of a zero energy eigenmode of the condensate , corresponding to the rotation of the wave function in real space .",

    "note that a quantum spreading of this angular variable takes place when time proceeds , as a consequence of the goldstone hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "now , for a non - zero value of the trap anisotropy , there is no so(2 ) symmetry any longer in the hamiltonian , so that the goldstone mode is turned into a regular mode of the condensate , behaving as a harmonic oscillator with a finite frequency .",
    "this means that the variable @xmath15 now experiences a potential .",
    "an intuitive estimate of this potential is obtained by taking the stationary solution , rotating it by an angle @xmath15 and calculating its gross - pitaevskii energy in the presence of a trap anisotropy : @xmath55 where we keep only the @xmath15 dependent part of the energy : @xmath56\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "we note in passing that the fact that @xmath11 is a local minimum of energy imposes that @xmath58 for all rotation angle @xmath15 so that @xmath59 quadratising @xmath60 around @xmath61 leads to the prediction that the angle @xmath62 oscillates when initially its value is different from zero .",
    "the resulting motion of the condensate is an oscillation of the lattice as a whole , i.  e.  a scissors mode with an angular frequency : @xmath63 this results in a @xmath1 dependence of the mode frequency in the case when @xmath64 does not vanish in the low @xmath0 limit .",
    "it is now clear why classical hydrodynamics does not exhibit this low energy mode : since it does not break so(2 ) symmetry , the corresponding goldstone mode is absent and so the low energy scissors mode does not appear .",
    "we note that , in cases where so(2 ) symmetry breaking would occur in the hydrodynamics equations , the scissors mode frequency would be predicted to tend to zero , even if the motion of the particles is not quantized ; this was indeed shown by an explicit solution of the superfluid hydrodynamic equation for a rotating vortex - free condensate exhibiting rotational symmetry breaking and the @xmath1 dependence of the scissors mode frequency was seen experimentally @xcite .",
    "a systematic way of calculating the eigenfrequencies of the condensate is simply to linearize the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation around a stationary solution , taking as unknown the vector @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the deviation of the field from its stationary value .",
    "one then faces the following operator , @xmath67^ * \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] where the complex conjugate of an operator @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 .",
    "the scissors mode we are looking for is an eigenstate of this operator , and the corresponding eigenvalue over @xmath70 gives the frequency of the mode .    at this stage",
    ", a technical problem appears , coming from the fact that the operator @xmath71 is not diagonalizable @xcite .",
    "this can be circumvented by using the number - conserving bogoliubov theory , in which the eigenmodes of the condensate are the eigenvectors of the following operator : @xmath72 where @xmath73 projects orthogonally to the condensate wave function @xmath74 and @xmath75 therefore projects orthogonally to @xmath76 .",
    "we shall assume here that the operator @xmath77 is diagonalizable for non - zero values of the trap anisotropy @xmath0 .",
    "we shall see in the next subsection that it is in general not diagonalizable for @xmath2 when several vortices are present .",
    "one then introduces the eigenmodes of @xmath78 , written as @xmath79 , such that @xmath80 ; to each of these eigenmodes of eigenvalue @xmath81 corresponds an eigenmode of @xmath78 of eigenvalue @xmath82 , given by @xmath83 @xcite .",

    "we shall also assume that the condensate wave function is a local minimum of the gross - pitaevskii energy functional ( condition of thermodynamical metastability ) so that all the @xmath81 are positive .",
    "we can then use the following result . for a given deviation @xmath84 of the condensate field from its stationary value ,",
    "we form the vectors @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an integer .",

    ", we assume that the scissors mode is the lowest energy bogoliubov mode , as motivated in section [ sec : goldstone ] .",
    "eq.([eq : upper ] ) then gives an upper bound to the scissors mode frequency .",
    "an explicit calculation of @xmath95 shows that the upper bound eq.([eq : upper ] ) coincides with the intuitive estimate eq.([eq : nu1 ] ) : @xmath96    this upper bound suggests two possibilities in the low @xmath0 limit . in the first one",
    ", @xmath97 tends to a non - zero value , which implies that the scissors mode frequency vanishes at most as @xmath98 . in the second possibility",
    ", @xmath97 tends to zero ; under the reasonable assumption of a @xmath97 vanishing linearly with @xmath0 , this implies a scissors mode frequency vanishing at most as @xmath0 .",
    "this second case we term ` degenerate ' .",
    "we point out that the degenerate case contains all the cases where the stationary wave function @xmath11 at vanishing trap anisotropy has a discrete rotational symmetry with an angle @xmath99 different from @xmath100 . to show this",
    ", we introduce the coordinates rotated by an angle @xmath99 , @xmath101 the symmetry of @xmath11 implies that @xmath102 and @xmath103 . by expansion of these identities , and assuming @xmath104 , one gets @xmath105 .",
    "an important question is to estimate the relative importance of the modes other than the scissors mode excited by the sudden rotation of the condensate . as shown in the appendix [ appen : bound ] , under the assumption that the scissors mode is the only mode of vanishing frequency when @xmath106 , and anticipating some results of the next subsection , the weight of the initial excitation @xmath107 on the non - scissors modes behaves as @xmath108 both in the degenerate and the non - degenerate cases .",
    "we now treat the anisotropic part of the trapping potential as a perturbation , @xmath109 .",
    "the bogoliubov operator @xmath78 , considered as a function of @xmath0 , can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a perturbation .",
    "note that the explicit expression of @xmath111 can not be given easily , as it involves not only @xmath112 but also the effect of the first order change of the condensate wave function entering the mean field terms of @xmath78 ; but we shall not need such an explicit expression .    apart from eigenmodes of non - zero eigenfrequency , the operator @xmath113 has a normal zero energy mode characterized by the vector @xmath114 and an anomalous mode characterized by the vector @xmath115 , in accordance with goldstone s theorem .",
    "they are given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the stationary condensate field for @xmath2 and @xmath118 is the projector on the @xmath2 condensate wavefunction @xmath119 . as shown in the appendix [ appen : bound ] , one has indeed @xmath120 and @xmath121 . within the subspace generated by @xmath114 and @xmath115 ,",
    "the operator @xmath113 has therefore the jordan canonical form : @xmath122 note that the normal and the anomalous vectors are , up to a global factor , adjoint vectors for the modified scalar product eq.([eq : scalar ] ) , in the sense that @xmath123 where @xmath124 is given in eq.([eq : masse ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "as usual in first order perturbation theory , one takes the restriction of the perturbation @xmath111 to the subspace and one then diagonalizes it : @xmath125 the notation @xmath126 means than one takes the component of @xmath127 onto the vector @xmath115 .",

    "an important property of the simplified energy functional is that the positions of the vortices minimizing eq.([eq : aftalion ] ) are universal quantities not depending on @xmath3 @xcite when they are rescaled by the length @xmath155 @xcite : @xmath156    now we calculate @xmath157 using the hellman - feynman theorem : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the energy per atom and @xmath160 is the condensate wave function .",
    "we have also that @xmath161 since the vortex - free configuration is rotationally symmetric for @xmath2 .",

    "we find that the 10-vortex configuration of figure [ fig : simul ] ceases indeed to be a local minimum of energy when @xmath0 is smaller than 0.0182 : this prevents us from applying eq.([eq : nusquared ] ) of perturbation theory to the calculation of the scissors mode frequency of the numerical simulations . the 10-vortex configuration of figure [ fig : toto]b ceases to be a local minimum of energy when @xmath0 is larger than 0.0173 .",
    "the 10-vortex configuration minimizing the energy for @xmath165 is a distorted configuration which breaks both the @xmath166 and @xmath167 reflection symmetries of the energy functional , but not the parity invariance , see figure [ fig : toto]c .",
    "the last point is to calculate the derivative of the mean angular momentum with respect to @xmath3 . in the thomas - fermi limit , for @xmath2 , and to first order in the squared distance of the vortex cores from the trap center , the angular momentum is given by @xcite : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the number of vortices .",

    "a simpler alternative is to calculate numerically the frequency of this mode by iterating the operator @xmath174 @xcite starting with the initial guess @xmath107 defined in eq.([eq : e0 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are presented in figure [ fig : cis3 ] in the non - degenerate case of two vortices , and in figure [ fig : cis14a16 ] in the degenerate case of three vortices . in the non - degenerate case",

    "we find numerically that @xmath172 scales as @xmath176 for low @xmath0 , which is indeed compatible with eq.([eq : upper ] ) which leads to a scissor frequency upper bound scaling as @xmath0 . the fact that a strictly higher exponent ( @xmath177 ) is obtained shows that some cancellation happens in the next order of perturbation theory , may be due to the threefold symmetry of the vortex configuration .",
    "in this paper we have studied the problem of a non - classical scissors mode of a condensate containing a vortex lattice . in 2d simulations of the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "we showed that , when such a condensate experiences a sudden rotation by a small angle of the anisotropic harmonic trapping potential , the orientation of its vortex lattice will undergo very low frequency oscillations of the scissors mode type .",
    "motivated by these numerical results we searched for this mode using the well - known classical hydrodynamics approximation where the condensate density is a smooth function showing no sign of the presence of vortices and where their effect on the velocity field is taken into account through a coarse - grained vorticity .",
    "we showed that this approximation does not contain a low energy scissors mode .",
    "we then were able to explain this discrepancy using the gross - pitaevskii equation that treats quantum mechanically the motion of the particles . in this case",
    ", the density profile of the vortex lattice breaks the rotational symmetry which naturally gives rise to a goldstone mode in the limit of an isotropic trap and , for a finite anisotropy it becomes a low energy scissors mode .",
    "the existence of a scissors mode at a low value of the mode frequency is therefore a direct consequence of the discrete nature of the vortices in a condensate , which is itself a consequence of the quantization of the motion of the particles .",
    "we obtained quantitative predictions for the mode frequency using two separate methods .",
    "first we calculated an upper bound on the frequency of the mode using an inequality involving the bogoliubov energy spectrum .",
    "second , using perturbation theory in @xmath0 , the anisotropy of the trapping harmonic potential , we showed that this inequality becomes an equality to leading order in @xmath0 when the expectation value @xmath178 taken in the unperturbed state does not vanish ; in this case the frequency of the scissors mode tends to zero as @xmath98 , and we gave an analytic prediction for the coefficient in front of @xmath98 in the thomas - fermi limit .",
    "however , in the cases where the expectation value does vanish ( which we termed `` degenerate '' ) , the frequency will be at most linear in @xmath0 .",
    "we have illustrated this using a three - vortex lattice where the frequency vanishes as @xmath176 .",
    "also , in the general case , we have shown that the relative weight of the non - scissors modes excited by a sudden infinitesimal rotation of the trap tends to zero as @xmath179 so that the excitation procedure produces a pure scissors mode in the low trap anisotropy limit .",
    "finally we point out that the existence of the non - classical scissors mode does not rely on the fact that we are dealing with a bose - einstein condensate _ per se_. in particular ,",
    "we expect , based on the very general arguments of section [ sec : goldstone ] , that this mode will equally be present in a fermi superfluid containing a vortex lattice and that its frequency will tend to zero as @xmath1 in the non - degenerate case just like in its bosonic counterpart .",

    "<S> we show that a bose - einstein condensate with a vortex lattice in a rotating anisotropic harmonic potential exhibits a very low frequency scissors mode . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of this mode is due to the so(2 ) symmetry - breaking introduced by the vortex lattice and , as a consequence of this , its frequency tends to zero with the trap anisotropy @xmath0 , with a generic @xmath1 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we present analytical formulas giving the mode frequency in the low @xmath0 limit and we show that the mode frequency for some class of vortex lattices can tend to zero as @xmath0 or faster . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the standard classical hydrodynamics approach fails to reproduce this low frequency mode , because it does not contain the discrete structure of the vortex lattice .    since their first observations in 1995 @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the trapped gaseous atomic bose - einstein condensates have been the subject of intense experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigation . a fruitful line of studies has been the measurement of the eigenmode frequencies of the bose - einstein condensate , which can be performed with a very high precision and therefore constitutes a stringent test of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest in the context of superfluidity are the scissors modes , first introduced in nuclear physics @xcite and occurring in quantum gases stored in a weakly anisotropic harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> these scissors modes have been studied theoretically @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite in a non - rotating gas , both in a condensate ( where they have a large frequency even in the limit of a vanishing trap asymmetry ) and in a classical gas ( where their frequency tends to zero in a vanishing trap asymmetry limit ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another fruitful line of studies has been the investigation of rotating bose - einstein condensates : above a critical rotation frequency of the anisotropic trap , it was observed experimentally that vortices enter the condensate and settle into a regular lattice @xcite . in this paper , we study theoretically the scissors modes of a bose - einstein condensate with several vortices present , a study motivated by the discovery of a low frequency scissors mode in three - dimensional simulations in @xcite . in section [ sec : </S>",
    "<S> basic ] , we define the model and the proposed experiment , and we present results from a numerical integration of the gross - pitaevskii equation : condensates with several vortices present have a scissors mode with a very low frequency , unlike non - rotating condensates . we show in section [ sec : hydro ] that the equations of classical hydrodynamics , often used to describe condensates with a very large number of vortices @xcite , fail to reproduce our numerical experiment . </S>",
    "<S> then , in the central part of our paper , section [ sec : goldstone ] , we interpret this mode in terms of a rotational symmetry breaking due to the presence of the vortices , which gives rise for @xmath2 to a goldstone mode of zero energy , becoming for finite @xmath0 a low frequency scissors mode and this leads to an explanation for the failure of the classical hydrodynamics approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we then use bogoliubov theory in section [ sec : bog ] to obtain an upper bound on the frequency on the scissors mode , which reveals that two situations may occur : in what we call the non - degenerate case , the frequency of the scissors mode tends to zero as the square root of the trap anisotropy , and we show with perturbation theory that the upper bound gives the exact result in this limit . in the opposite degenerate case , the frequency of the scissors mode tends to zero at least linearly in the trap anisotropy , and this we illustrate with a numerical calculation of the mode frequency for a three - vortex configuration . </S>",
