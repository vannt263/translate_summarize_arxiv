    "the precise theoretical and experimental investigation of top - quark properties @xcite is crucial not only for understanding the electroweak dynamics in the standard model , but also for exploring new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "especially , information of the top - quark polarization can reveal the chiral structure of new physics . to translate the chiral couplings of a top quark to new physics into observable polarization signals ,",
    "the top quark must be sufficiently boosted , as chirality is equivalent to helicity in the massless limit .",
    "a top quark may be produced with large boost at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the future 14 tev run , for example , directly through the quark and antiquark annihilation , or indirectly through the decay of a new massive particle .",
    "the final states of a boosted top quark then become collimated and form a single jet .",
    "the polarization of a top quark , if produced at rest , is determined by measuring the angular distribution of decay products ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such measurement is not feasible even for the final - state lepton with the largest spin analyzing power , as a top quark is highly boosted .",
    "fixed - order calculations and soft - gluon resummations associated with the boosted top quark production have been performed in the standard model @xcite .",
    "exploration of new physics beyond the standard model by means of boosted top quarks was studied intensively in @xcite .",
    "various strategies for tagging a boosted top quark were proposed in @xcite , and experimental searches have been conducted by atlas and cms recently @xcite .",
    "the relation between the polarization of a boosted top quark and the energy fraction distribution of a particular subjet was discussed in @xcite using monte carlo generators .",
    "given an algorithm for the subjet selection , different energy fraction distributions for the left- and right - handed top jets have been noticed .",
    "it implies that jet substructures can serve as observables for distinguishing the helicity of a boosted polarized top quark . in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) framework that the energy profile of a top jet is a simple and useful substructure for this purpose without requiring decomposition of subjets and algorithms for subject selection as in @xcite , @xmath2-tagging , @xmath3-reconstruction or measurement of missing momentum .",
    "we start with the jet function of a polarized leptonic top , which undergoes the @xmath0 decay as an example . in pqcd",
    "this function is factorized into the convolution of a hard top - quark decay kernel with the bottom - quark jet function .",
    "the latter can be well approximated by the light - quark jet function @xcite derived in the qcd resummation formalism @xcite , as the jet energy is high enough .",
    "evaluating the hard kernel to leading order ( lo ) in qcd , we obtain the dependencies of the left- and right - handed top - quark jet functions on the top - jet momentum and cone radius .",
    "it is found that the top - quark jet function is not sensitive to the helicity as expected , since its peak position is basically determined by the top - quark mass .",
    "the similarity of the jet functions implies the similarity of the mass distributions of the left- and right - handed top jets .",
    "hence , boosted top candidates can be identified by means of the jet mass measurement , together with other promising techniques available in the literature .",
    "certainly , the mass measurement demands reconstruction of a missing neutrino momentum , which we do not intend to explore further .",
    "the essence is that additional information on the internal structure of a top jet is required in order to distinguish its helicity .    after practicing the factorization of the top - quark jet function , we extend it to the top - jet energy profile @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of top jets with cone radius @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the radius of a test cone centered around the top - jet axis , @xmath8 is the transverse momentum carried by particle @xmath9 in the top jet @xmath10 .",
    "the lepton energy is not included in @xmath11 , and the neutrino energy , as a missing momentum , does not contribute either .",
    "this observable is then expressed as the convolution of a hard top - quark decay kernel with the bottom - quark jet energy function . inputting the light - quark jet energy function derived also from the qcd resummation @xcite",
    ", we predict the energy profiles of the left- and right - handed top jets .",
    "it turns out that the energy profile is sensitive to the helicity : energy is accumulated faster within a left - handed top jet than within a right - handed one , a feature related to the @xmath1 structure of weak interaction .",
    "the dependencies of the energy profiles of the left- and right - handed top jets on the top - jet momentum and cone radius are presented for future experimental confrontation .",
    "our work does not only represent an application of pqcd to the study of jet substructures of a boosted weakly decaying massive particle , but also highlights the energy profile as a simple and useful observable for distinguishing the helicity of a boosted top quark .",
    "the pqcd factorization formulas for the jet function and the jet energy function of a polarized leptonic top are constructed in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] .",
    "the sensitivity of the top - jet mass distribution and energy profile to the helicity is examined numerically in sec .",

    "in this paper we have studied the helicity dependence of the mass distribution and the energy profile as examples of jet substructures for a boosted polarized top quark .",
    "the former ( latter ) is factorized into the convolution of the hard top - quark decay kernel with the bottom - quark jet function ( jet energy function ) .",
    "it has been found that the qcd effects introduced by the bottom - quark jet function on the mass distribution of a polarized top jet are minor .",
    "those introduced by the bottom - quark jet energy function on the top - jet energy profile are more significant , which lower the lo top - jet energy profile by 15% at @xmath12 and by 30% at @xmath13 for the top - jet energy @xmath14 tev and cone radius @xmath15 .",
    "the reduction is similar for the right- and left - handed top jets , since qcd interaction is vector - like , i.e. , it is independent of the chirality of the top quark .",
    "both the jet mass distribution and the jet energy profile of the left - handed top jet are larger than those of the right - handed one for various top - jet energies and cone radii .",
    "this observation is a consequence of the @xmath1 structure of weak interaction , under which the favored direction of the emitted bottom quark is opposite to the top spin .",
    "however , the mass distribution is not sensitive to the helicity , but the energy profile is : energy is accumulated faster within the left - handed top jet than within the right - handed one .",
    "the difference is about 30% at small @xmath16 with a larger top - jet cone @xmath17 for typical boosted top quarks at the lhc .",
    "the measurement of the neutrino missing momentum , the @xmath2-tagging , and the @xmath3-reconstruction are not required for this observable .",
    "that is , the energy profile is a simple and useful jet substructure for helicity discrimination of a boosted top quark , which can help identification of new physics beyond the standard model at the lhc .",
    "we expect differences in other jet substructures of the left- and right - handed top jets .",
    "a straightforward application of our formalism is to study the leptonic energy distributions , whose difference between the left- and right - handed top jets is also related to the @xmath1 structure of weak interaction .",
    "an improved method to measure the polarization of a hadronic top has been proposed in @xcite , in which the helicity dependencies of top jet observables were explored .",
    "we will extend our formalism to analysis of jet substructures of a boosted hadronically decaying top quark .",
    "in addition to the factorization of qcd radiations into three light - quark jets , a soft function , which collects soft gluon exchanges among the three final - state light quarks , needs to be introduced .",
    "the behavior of this soft function can be extracted through the resummation technique in the manner the same as for the light - particle jet functions @xcite .",
    "the energy profile of a hadronically decaying top jet can then be predicted .",
