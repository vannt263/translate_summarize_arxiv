    "in numerically solving boundary value problems for time - dependent equations , emphasis is on discretizations in time @xcite . for parabolic equations of second order ,",
    "unconditionally stable schemes are constructed using implicit approximations @xcite .",
    "two - level schemes are commonly used in computational practice , whereas multilevel schemes occur more rarely . for unconditionally stable schemes ,",
    "a time step is selected only due to the accuracy of the approximate solution .",
    "the problem of the control over a time step is relatively well resolved for the numerically solving cauchy problem for systems of differential equations @xcite .",
    "the basic approach involves the following stages .",
    "first , we perform additional calculations in order to estimate the error of the the approximate solution at a new time level . further",
    ", a time step is estimated using the theoretical asymptotic dependence of accuracy on a time step .",
    "after that we decide is it necessary to correct the time step and to repeat calculations .    additional calculations for estimating the error of the approximate solution may be performed in a different way . in particular , it is possible to obtain an approximate solution using two different schemes that have the same theoretical order of accuracy .",
    "the most famous example of this strategy involves the solution of the problem on a separate time interval using a preliminary step ( the first solution ) and the step reduced by half ( the second solution ) . in numerically solving the cauchy problem for systems of ordinary differential equations , there are are also applied nested methods , where two approximate solutions of different orders of accuracy are compared .    in the above - mentioned methods of selecting a time step , a posteriori estimation of accuracy is employed . in this case , we decide is this time step acceptable or it is necessary to change it for re - calculations ( increase or reduced and how much ) only after performing calculations .",
    "such strategies can be also applied to the approximate solution of unsteady boundary value problems using a more advanced a posteriori analysis @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an a priori selection of a time step for the approximate solution of boundary value problems for parabolic equations . to obtain the solution at a new time level , the backward euler scheme is employed .",
    "the time step at the new time level is explicitly calculated using two previous time levels and takes into account changes in the equation coefficients and its right - hand side .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we consider a cauchy problem for a system of linear ordinary differential equations that is obtained from numerically solving boundary value problems for parabolic equations after discretization in space .",
    "for the approximate solution , estimates for stability are presented along with estimates for accuracy in the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "formulas for the selection of a time step are obtained in section 3 using a comparison of the problem solutions corresponding to the forward time level and backward one . in section 4",
    ", we show that similar expressions for a time step can be obtained via making a comparison of the solutions derived with one time step and two half steps .",

    "assume that @xmath3 in @xmath2 .",
    "due to the non - negativity of the operator @xmath4 , for the problem ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) , we have the following estimate for stability with respect for the initial data and the right - hand side : @xmath5    the problem ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) results from finite difference , finite volume or finite element approximations ( lumped masses scheme @xcite ) for numerically solving boundary value problems for a parabolic equation of second order . in this problem",

    "the equation is complemented by the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath11 and the initial condition @xmath12    to solve numerically this time - dependent problem , we introduce a non - uniform grid in time : @xmath13 we will employ notation @xmath14 . for the problem ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) , we apply the fully implicit scheme , where the transition from the current time level to the next one is performed as follows : @xmath15 starting from the initial condition @xmath16    under the restriction @xmath17 , from ( [ 2.4 ] ) , it follows immediately that the approximate solution satisfies the level - wise estimate @xmath18 thus , we obtain the discrete analog of the estimate ( [ 2.3 ] ) : @xmath19 corresponding to the problem ( [ 2.4 ] ) , ( [ 2.5 ] ) . for the error @xmath20 of the approximate solution",
    ", we have the problem @xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 stands for the truncation error : @xmath24 similarly to ( [ 2.6 ] ) , we get the estimate for error : @xmath25 therefore , to control the error , we can employ the summarized error @xmath26 over the interval @xmath27 . in this case , a value @xmath28 defines the same level of the error over the entire interval of integration .",
    "if we will be able to calculate the truncation error @xmath23 , then it will be possible to get a posteriori estimate of the error . comparing @xmath29 with the prescribed error level @xmath28 ,",
    "this makes possible to evaluate the quality of the choice of the time step @xmath30 .",
    "namely , if @xmath29 is much larger ( smaller ) than @xmath28 , then the time step is taken too large ( small ) , and if @xmath29 is close to @xmath28 , then this time step is optimal . thus , we have @xmath31 the problem is that we can not evaluate the truncation error , since it is determined using the exact solution that is unknown .",
    "because of this , we must focus on some estimates for the truncation error that guarantee the fulfilment of ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",

    ": :    the step @xmath30 is evaluated via closeness between    @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , we carry out the back analysis of the error of the approximate solution over the interval @xmath27 using two schemes ( explicit and implicit ) of the same accuracy .",
    "let us present the formulas for selecting a time step .",
    "the solution @xmath32 is determined from the equation @xmath37 for @xmath34 , we have @xmath38 from ( [ 3.2 ] ) , ( [ 3.3 ] ) , we immediately get @xmath39    the first two terms are associated with the time derivative applied to the problem operator and to the right - hand side . to evaluate them approximately",
    ", it seems reasonable to use the time step from the previous time level . but this may be inconvenient to implement .    for instance , we have @xmath40 and therefore we have to evaluate the difference derivative of the right - hand side for @xmath41 .",
    "the problem is that the derivation of such estimates involves the unknown value @xmath33 .",
    "the simplest approach is to evaluate this derivative using the previous time step : @xmath42 but in this case , if @xmath43 , then we can not detect significant changes in the right - hand side for @xmath44 .    to resolve the problem , it is possible to use the standard methods available to control a time step for numerically solving time - dependent problems .",
    "the first method restricts the growth of the time step with respect to the previous value .",
    "we set @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a numerical parameter .",
    "the second requirement is that the step can not be too small : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a specified minimum time step .    under the assumption ( [ 3.5 ] ) , we can estimate the time derivative of the right - hand side , putting @xmath49 therefore @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 for the last term in the right - hand side of ( [ 3.4 ] ) , in view of ( [ 2.4 ] ) , we have @xmath53 with accuracy up to @xmath54 , we put @xmath55 with this in mind , the equality ( [ 3.4 ] ) is replaced by the approximate equality : @xmath56    the value of @xmath57 we associate with the solution error over the interval @xmath27 . because of this , we set @xmath58 from ( [ 3.8 ] ) , we have @xmath59    in view of ( [ 3.5 ] ) , ( [ 3.6 ] ) , ( [ 3.9 ] ) , from ( [ 3.8 ] ) , we obtain the following formula for calculating the time step : @xmath60 this formula for selecting a time step reflects clearly ( see the denominator in the expression for @xmath61 ) corrective actions , which are related to the time - dependence of the problem operator ( the first part ) and the right - hand side ( the second part ) as well as to the time - variation of the solution itself ( the third part ) .",
    "to solve numerically the cauchy problem , the traditional strategy is to select an integration step using a comparison of the approximate solution obtained by the preliminary step with the solution calculated with the step reduced by half . for numerically solving problem ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) , we use fully implicit scheme ( [ 2.4 ] ) , ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",

    "to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm ( [ 3.5 ] ) , ( [ 3.9 ] ) for selecting a time step based on the implicit scheme for solving the problem ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) , let us consider the boundary value problem for a one - dimensional parabolic equation .",
    "let @xmath74 satisfies the equation @xmath75 as well as the boundary and the initial conditions : @xmath76 @xmath77    to solve approximately the problem ( [ 5.1])([5.3 ] ) , we apply finite difference discretization in space .",
