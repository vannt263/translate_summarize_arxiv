    "right part of figure  [ fig:1d_3ions ] .",

    "the resulting electron energy spectrum of a tdse simulation for such a process and the expected ( classical ) cut - off energies are shown in figure  [ fig:1d_3ions ] .",
    "the signal of the three - fold scattered electrons forming the third plateau is very weak , since many processes occur simultaneously and parts of the wave function undergo several collisions at all types of combinations of laser field phases and only a very small fraction is accelerated optimally .",
    "hence , the simulations have to be performed with high resolution on especially fine numerical grids as well in space as in time . for larger setups consisting of four or even more ions in a chain ,",
    "the resonance conditions can of course be derived , but it is nearly impossible to detect the corresponding electrons forming the expected plateaus of resonantly scattered electrons in the energy domain .",
    "as demonstrated above , the one - dimensional model allows for a computationally fast access to scattering processes in ( strong ) laser fields and the corresponding distributions of fast electrons and a simple understanding of the physical processes . nevertheless , it is not able to make robust predictions for experiments because the intensity of high - energy electrons is clearly overestimated since it neglects the additional angular degrees of freedom and the spatial spreading of the electronic wave packets in a real system .",

    "as one recognizes from the single - ion scattering case , the electron density is distributed over a large space ( all angles @xmath55 ) which , consequently , leads to a strongly reduced intensity of electrons in a specific energy and angle interval .",
    "especially the case of fast electrons at highest possible acceleration shows the lowest total yield of electrons in the energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , the question occurs , if a second ion placed at a distance @xmath38 which allows for resonant increase of energy , leads also to a double - plateau like structure in the energy spectra with the corresponding high energies , cf .",

    "the result of a tdse simulation with @xmath37 is given in figure  [ fig:2d_2ions ] , together with the expected classical cut - off energies for total backward ( forward ) scattering ( white dashed lines ) , estimated according to the considerations for the one - dimensional model .",
    "the signal of the singly scattered electrons with optimal energy transfer from the laser field to the electron in backward direction are easily identified ( classical cut - off 1 ) . however , in forward direction ( @xmath49 ) the situation is different .",
    "no obvious double - plateau like distribution can be spotted and only a very weak signal of ( fast ) electrons is obtained for energies below the classical estimated cut - off energy ( classical cut - off 2 ) .",
    "the reason for this is the low intensity of fast electrons from the first collision .",
    "the electrons are distributed over a large spatial area and therefore only a very small fraction is colliding with the second ion .",

    "the simplest idea is to confine the electron wave function in direction of the laser field , the travelling direction of the wave packet and the alignment axis of the scattering centers .",
    "this can be achieved by using a harmonic oscillator potential perpendicular to @xmath50 , @xmath58 the trap frequency in @xmath59-direction is denoted by @xmath60 , the motion in @xmath46-direction ( direction of @xmath50 and the laser field ) is not affected by this potential .",

    "the benefits of this potential are two - fold : first , the numerical effort decreases enormously , since in @xmath59-direction only a small extension of the numerical grid is needed .",
    "the second advantage originates from the physics : the potential focusses the electron wave packet in direction of its central momentum and , therefore , onto a second scattering center , if present .",
    "this should increase the total yield in intensity of fast electrons by orders of magnitude and finally should converge ( for large @xmath60 ) to the results of the 1d calculations .",
    "a few adaptions of the methods used previously in this paper have to be made , owing to the changed geometry .",

    "secondly , the detector is adjusted to this setup . besides an energy - shift by the eigenvalue in @xmath59-direction , the energy spectrum is integrated over an angle element @xmath63 in forward ( @xmath49 ) and backward ( @xmath54 ) direction since a full angular - resolved energy spectrum for such a setup is not useful . typically @xmath64 is used .    .",

    "only the energy spectrum of backward scattered electrons into the angle element @xmath67 is plotted .",
    "all spectra show a similar structure with a cut - off energy near the expected classical maximum energy transfer . for a comparison of the intensities ( logarithmic scale ) the height of the backward scattering plateau for the 2d case",
    "is indicated by a blue dashed line as a guide to the eye . the trend which arises by introducing the confinement",
    "is easily observed : the intensity of backward scattered electrons is increased with stronger entrapment in @xmath59-direction .",
    "this is , of course , the effect of the expected focussing .",
    "the comparison with the 1d calculations ( lowest graph ) is difficult .",
    "the normalization of the spectrum underestimates the total yield since no corresponding angle element @xmath63 is available in 1d .",
    "therefore the line for the 2d plateau height indication should be located somewhat lower than given in the graph .    in the last part",

    "the ( strong ) external confinement of @xmath70 leads to a focussing of the backward scattered electrons during the first collision on the second ion , which now plays a more significant role in the formation of the energy spectrum .",

    "figure  [ fig:2d_2ions ] .",
    "but , in contrast to the 1d calculations , the total yield is again very weak and only hardly distinguishable from the noise in the spectrum due to numerical effects",
    ". additionally , the cut - off energies of the two plateaus are not as prominent as in 1d which might be attributed to the fact that electrons are scattered at different angles and , thus , different energies are collected by the confinement which smear out the distribution .",
    "we have investigated electron - ion collisions in strong laser fields quantum - mechanically by numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation . distributions of fast electrons being accelerated by the laser field during the collisions were observed .",
    "different spatial arrangements of ( fixed - in - space ) ions were considered to benefit from resonance conditions .",
    "the already known single and double ion scattering setups were generalized to three ions , where a further increase in electron energies could be demonstrated in one - dimensional model systems . for laser systems with an intensity of @xmath71 at an photon energy of @xmath72 , the scattering on spatially correlated ions at a distance of @xmath73 leads to a maximum energy of @xmath74 ( by using an initial electron energy of @xmath75 ) .",
    "an even higher energy can be obtained by utilizing three ions .",
    "here one expects , according to our simulations , a maximum electron energy of @xmath76 , accelerated over a total setup which measures only approximately @xmath77 .    to account for angular degrees of freedom in the scattering in more than one dimension and the expected decrease in efficiency",
    ", 2d systems were investigated in detail .",
    "the corresponding angular distributions of fast electrons showed a rich structure , where the spreading of the wave function and the significant decrease in intensity became visible .",
    "therefore , resonance phenoma found in one - dimensional systems by collisions on more than one ion , could only be identified by introducing additional focussing potentials , which offer the possibility to increase the intensity of optimally scattered electrons enormously , compared to unconfined 2d systems .",
    "an additional increase of the high energy electron yield could be achieved by using highly charged ions and optimized laser polarization ( pulse shaping ) ."
