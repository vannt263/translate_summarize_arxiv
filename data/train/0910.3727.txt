    "quantum states of light can improve the sensitivity of phase measurements beyond the limits that apply to classical light sources .",
    "the phase sensitivity of coherent light ( and hence of all classical light ) is limited by the shot noise of independent photon detection events to the standard quantum limit of @xmath7 .",
    "this limit can be overcome by using the multi - photon coherences of non - classical light @xcite . for two mode @xmath2-photon systems ,",
    "the highest possible phase sensitivity is achieved by maximally path - entangled states , which are superposition states @xmath8 where all photons are either in one path or in the other path of a two path interferometer@xcite .",
    "the phase sensitivity of these states defines the heisenberg limit of @xmath9 .",
    "since no @xmath2-photon states achieve a higher phase sensitivity , this is the absolute limit of phase estimation for a fixed photon number @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is rather difficult to generate maximally path - entangled states using the available sources of non - classical light @xcite .",
    "it was therefore a significant discovery that the interference of a coherent state and a squeezed vacuum produces a high fraction of maximal path - entangled states when the average photon number from the squeezed vacuum is about equal to the average photon number of the coherent light @xcite .",
    "in particular , pezze and smerzi showed that conventional two - path interferometry can achieve phase sensitivities close to the heisenberg limit even in the presence of fluctuating total photon number @xcite .",
    "these results seem to put heisenberg limited phase estimation within the reach of well - established quantum technologies .",
    "however , maximally path - entangled states are very sensitive to photon losses , since the loss of a single photon can completely randomize the multi - photon coherence between the paths @xcite . we can therefore expect that the heisenberg - limited phase sensitivity achieved by coherent light and squeezed vacuum will rapidly decline as photon losses increase .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the effect of photon losses on the phase sensitivity of the two - mode states generated by interference of coherent light and squeezed vacuum in detail . assuming equal losses in both optical modes , we derive the mixed state after losses and find an optimal phase estimator based on the general analysis for quantum metrology using mixed states @xcite .",
    "we find that the cramer - rao bound giving the maximal phase sensitivity of the state can be achieved by a simple experimental setup using a weak local oscillator field and photon detection .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain a phase sensitivity equal to the fisher information @xmath0 in an experimentally feasible setup using only linear optics and photon detection . in the limit of high squeezing",
    ", the ratio @xmath1 of fisher information above shot noise to the square of the average photon number @xmath2 depends only on the fraction of squeezed vacuum photons @xmath4 and the average number of photons lost @xmath3 . thus the effect of photon losses on phase sensitivities close to the heisenberg limit has the same dependence on the average number of photons lost , regardless of the total average photon number @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , photon losses reduce the phase sensitivity for heisenberg - limited estimation at @xmath5 by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we investigate the possibility of improving the fisher information by optimizing the squeezing fraction @xmath4 for a given number of photons lost .",

    "it may therefore present an interesting alternative to direct photon counting in the output , even if the improvement in phase sensitivity is negligibly small .",
    "in general , our results confirm that phase estimation near the heisenberg limit can be performed with squeezed - coherent light , but only if the average number of photons lost can be kept low .",
    "therefore , high efficiencies of photon transmission and detection will be essential for quantum metrology close to the heisenberg limit .",
