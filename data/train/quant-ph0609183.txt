    "at present a significant progress in quantum information , communication and especially quantum cryptography requires the new methods and approaches in quantum information processing - see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "important step in this direction can be taken with the help of novel optical devices operated with atoms for quantum storage , memory and transmission of information . as a rule ,",
    "memory devices proposed now in atomic optics for those purposes explore various methods of entanglement of atoms with quantized electromagnetic field and the mapping of quantum state of light onto the atomic ensembles  [ 26 ] .",
    "the principal point is to achieve the light - atom coherence for long .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite atomic ensemble has been prepared as an approximately coherent spin state with only one projection , say @xmath0 , having non - zero average value . within this limit atomic system",
    "can be described by collective magnetic momentum @xmath1 of the ground state .",
    "the fidelity of up to @xmath2 and memory lifetime of up to @xmath3 have been achieved experimentally for gaussian light pulses in the three step scheme of passing for light - atom interaction , and subsequent measurements in the system have been carried out by feedback introduced into the atoms .",
    "another attractive and practically important opportunity to create macroscopic coherence in atomic medium and to store coherently the optical information as a result , is given by effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) taking place in three level atomic systems with so called @xmath4-configuration of the energy levels .",
    "in this case strong ( classical ) coupling field creates transparency window in the medium , and second weak ( quantum ) probe field propagates through the resonant atomic system with a very small absorption  @xcite .",
    "the eit effect is accompanied by significant reduction of observable group velocity of propagating signal pulse , as well .",
    "such a macroscopic coherence as a result of the field - medium interaction has been observed for both hot and ultracold atomic ensembles . as an example , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite propose to use such a `` stopped '' light for coherent ( classical ) storage of information in ultracold ( @xmath5 ) sodium atoms near the transition to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) state . in fact , the phenomenon is demonstrated by switching signal pulse with delay time ( i.e. storage time of light in the medium ) @xmath6 and more .",
    "the doppler broadening , being limitation for the process , can be suppressed for the case .",
    "in contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite the energy transfer from light to atomic excitations for hot ( @xmath7 ) atomic @xmath8 vapor cell has been observed as a principal approach to storing information .",
    "it is important to mention that quantum memory proposals based om eit - type interaction in the medium leaves open principal question about criterion for storing and transmission of quantum information  cf . with  @xcite .",
    "physically , quantum properties of atomic system coupled with e.m . field , can be described in terms of `` bright '' ( optical branch ) and `` dark '' ( atomic branch ) polaritons , being the two solutions of the problem in the terms of linear superposition of quantized optical field and atom excitation states ",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "but existence of polaritons is not sufficient especially for quantum storage and transfer of information by some quantum memory device , and specific properties of quantum state become more important in the case ",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite , cf .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .  @xcite we propose a new quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) technique to store the quantum information which is very closed to the qnd measurement procedure in quantum and atomic optics  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that atomic system under the bec condition satisfies formulated criteria for reasonable efficiency of quantum information storage and transmission simultaneously , and therefore is perspective for creating a long lived memory . however , the atomic bec medium is not feasible for wide practical exploring due to extremely low temperature ( about few nanokelvins ) conditions .",
    "therefore the study of the problem of high - temperature quasi - condensation phenomenon for cavity excitons and polaritons evoks a great interest  [ 1113 ] .",
    "although polaritonic condensate is nonequilibrium principaly , the formation of single ( macroscopic ) coherent polariton state ( ground state with momentum @xmath9 ) has been observed recently for quantum wells placed in semiconductor cdte / cdmgte - microcavity  @xcite . in ref .  @xcite the authors experimentally measure the dispersion curve for low brunch polaritons in semiconductor ( ga - as)-microcavity .",
    "it has been shown that the statistical properties of excitons can be changed into the coherent ones .    speaking more precisely such a strong coupling regime for the cavity polaritons",
    "can be considered as a weakly interacting 2d bose - gas for which the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition occurs at the temperatures high enough ( room ) due to extremely small mass of polaritons @xmath10 g  @xcite .",
    "the last circumstance is very attractive and important for practical purposes and namely , for elaboration of quantum memory devices .",
    "recently in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that a quasi - condensation phenomenon can be also achieved for polaritons in atomic system under the strong coupling condition for e.m.field and two - level atoms in the cavity , described by relation    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is so - called cooperative frequency , @xmath13 is the frequency of atomic transition , @xmath14 is the dipole momentum , @xmath15 is the time of coherence of the medium , @xmath16 is the density of atomic cloud,@xmath17 is the planck constant . within this limit the process of vacuum rabi splitting for the cavity modes occurs , and such a splitting corresponds to the degeneracy of the 2d ideal polariton gas . in particular",
    ", this takes place in a real experimental situation with the hot _ na _ atomic vapor cell placed into the resonator  @xcite .",
    "moreover is also possible to achieve a true room temperatures bec for polaritons under the certain conditions for optical trapping of the cavity polaritons .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method to store quantum information by means of quantum cloning procedure for continuous variables of optical field in a light - atom interaction in the cavity under condition of strong coupling regime ( cf .",
    "the high temperature quasi - condensation phenomenon for the cavity polaritons occurs in the case ( section 2 ) .",
    "we consider simple model for interaction of two - level atoms with quantized e.m .",
    "field in the cavity . @xmath18 in section 3 we examine a new scheme for optimal quantum cloning of information in such coherent atomic system . in appendix",
    "we develop a holstein - primakoff approach to formulate the quasi - condensation condition for macroscopic coupled states being realized for excitations in two level bosonic system interacting with quantum e.m . field . in conclusion",

    "the dispersion relation for photon energy @xmath33 inside of the cavity can be represented as :    @xmath34    the polariton quasi - condensation occurs in the plane being normal to wave vector component @xmath35 .",
    "physically it means that macroscopic occupation of the state with @xmath36 takes place in the case . at the same time within the limit of a single cavity mode approximation ( for @xmath35 ) we can rewrite hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) in the form",

    "recently various multi - pass protocols have been proposed for retrieving quantum optical state , for verifying quantum storage state and for increasing the fidelity , respectively  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the retrieval procedure for continuous variables consists of mapping measured light quadrature back into the atomic quadtrature variables in the medium with certain feedback gain . in some sense",
    "such a technique is similar to the method proposed earlier to achieve a good qnd - measurement for light quadrature component and/or photon number ",
