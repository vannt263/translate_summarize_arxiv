    "the hera and tevatron experiments have now produced abundant high quality data on the ` single diffractive ' processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 at low momentum transfer . hard scales , provided for example by a highly virtual photon ( in the @xmath4 case ) or final state jets or heavy quarks , encourage the use of perturbative qcd as a tool with which to understand the parton level dynamics .",

    "the photon is replaced by an anti - proton , with either of the beam particles dissociating.two further variables are usually introduced ; the fraction of the proton momentum that is exchanged to the system @xmath10 is denoted @xmath12 is usually referred to as @xmath13 . here @xmath12 is used to make explicit the correspondence with the equivalent variable at the tevatron . ] , whilst @xmath14 is the fraction of the exchanged momentum carried by the quark coupling to the photon .",

    "this implies that a concept of ` diffractive parton distributions ' can be introduced @xcite , expressing proton parton probability distributions under the constraint of an intact final state proton with particular values of @xmath15 and @xmath9 . the cross section for diffractive dis",

    "gives a reasonable description of the measurement .",
    "similarly good agreement is found with zeus data on diffractive charm electroproduction @xcite , though a diffractive @xmath29 measurement from h1 in a slightly different kinematic region suggests deviations from factorisation @xcite . with this single exception ,",

    "the data and prediction are also rather different in shape .",
    "another recent measurement from cdf is the fraction of visible beauty production that is attributable to diffraction , which yields the result @xcite @xmath42 whereas the predictions on the basis of diffractive parton densities extracted from @xmath43 data are at the level of @xmath44 .    in a complementary analysis ,",
    "alvero et al @xcite have extracted diffractive parton distributions from @xmath25 and photoproduction dijet data from hera and made predictions for various tevatron measurements .",
    "similarly large discrepancies are found when predicting the rate of @xmath8 and dijet production as components of the system @xmath10 in the process @xmath45 @xcite , with even larger differences for dijet production in the double pomeron exchange process @xmath46 .",
    "something beyond the simplest regge and qcd factorisation assumptions is clearly required to describe simultaneously diffractive data from hera and the tevatron .",
    "the pertinent question now is whether it is possible to build a phenomenological model of this breakdown of factorisation .",
    "one possibility is that where beam remnants are present on both sides of a rapidity gap , rescattering takes place , tending to destroy the gap .",
    "a very interesting place to study this possibility is in photoproduction , where both factorisable ( direct photon ) and non - factorisable ( resolved photon ) interactions may be expected to be present .",
    "a first study can be found in @xcite .",
    "total hadron - hadron cross sections are well described over a very wide energy range by two component regge fits @xcite , corresponding ( via the optical theorem ) to the exchange of the pomeron and a sub - leading ( @xmath23 , @xmath22 , @xmath47 , @xmath24 ) trajectory in the elastic amplitude .",
    "the intercept of the leading pomeron trajectory is most accurately determined from the high energy rise in the @xmath5 cross section .",
    "other total cross sections such as @xmath48 match this scheme well , though no data exist at centre of mass energies @xmath49 .",
    "in the case where one or both of the interacting hadrons is replaced by a photon , arguments have been made that the presence of a bare photon coupling in addition to the vector meson dominance hadronic component may lead to a faster rise of the total cross section with energy than is the case for pure hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "eikonalised minijet models @xcite , incorporating semi - hard qcd interactions whilst avoiding the eventual violation of unitarity associated with simple regge pole models , can be made to fit the available data @xcite .",
    "hera data on the total @xmath50 cross section at centre of mass energy @xmath51 @xcite are consistent with the simple regge pole model , though the systematic errors are large and no strong conclusion is yet possible",
    ". the increasingly precise data from lep on the total @xmath0 cross section , which may be expected to rise faster even than the @xmath50 cross section , may shed some light on this issue .",
    "both l3 @xcite and opal @xcite have measured the total @xmath0 cross section in the region @xmath52 . for the data used ,",
    "both electrons and many final state hadrons are lost down the beam - pipe , making the kinematics difficult to constrain .",
    "the data are shown , together with lower energy fixed target data , in figure  [ gammagamma]a .",
    "the lep data clearly show the high energy rise with @xmath8 observed in the @xmath5 , @xmath53 and @xmath50 cross sections .",
    "a simple factorisation law of the type @xmath54 describes the data remarkably well .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the rise with @xmath8 is faster than that observed for total hadron - hadron cross sections ; the opal data are consistent with the pomeron intercept describing soft hadronic interactions whereas the l3 result is significantly larger .",
    "the results are rather sensitive to the assumptions on @xmath55 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ gammagamma]a , a model based on minijets @xcite also gives a reasonable description of the data , as do the schuler and sjstrand @xcite and phojet @xcite models , which attempt to make smooth transitions between the photon in its hadronic and point - like manifestations .",
    "( 120,70 ) ( 0,-3 ) ( 80,-3 ) ( 65,22 ) ( 100,10 )    improved data are required before a firm conclusion can be reached concerning the possible anomalous behaviour of @xmath56 .",
    "the main source of error in the measurements arises from the model dependence of the acceptance corrections , with results different at the level of @xmath57 obtained when phojet or pythia @xcite is used for the corrections .",
    "the principal reason for this is the different treatments of the diffractive channels in the two models .",
    "any constraints that can be placed on the diffractive processes in @xmath0 scattering will improve the total cross section measurement considerably .",
    "processes involving the quasi - elastic production of vector mesons are likely to be the easiest to measure , due to the well known decay angular distributions . l3",
    "have taken the first steps towards measurements of the ` quasi - elastic ' ( @xmath58 ) and ` single dissociation ' ( @xmath59 ) processes .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath9 distribution of the single dissociation process is shown in figure  [ gammagamma]b .",
    "fitting the data to the usual exponential parameterisation @xmath60 yields a slope parameter in the region @xmath61 .",
    "information of this sort provides very useful input to soft physics models and should ultimately reduce the model dependence uncertainties on the total cross section .",
    "the bfkl evolution equation , which resums terms where large logarithms of the form @xmath62 multiply the coupling constant , must represent a valid approximation to parton dynamics in some region of low @xmath1 phase space .",
    "the search for evidence for bfkl behaviour is one of the principle current experimental activities in low @xmath1 physics . although it has been shown that introducing bfkl effects can improve the description of @xmath63 at low @xmath1 @xcite",
    ", it is not yet accepted that anything more than standard dglap evolution is required to describe current inclusive dis data .",
    "exclusive final state measurements may ultimately produce the clearest bfkl signatures .",
    "some of the more promising areas of study are discussed below .",
    "bfkl and dglap evolution have rather different implications for the details of the parton ladder governing low @xmath1 dis processes ( figure  [ diagrams]c ) . in the dglap case ,",
    "one expects an ordering in virtuality ( @xmath64 ) of the partons in the ladder , leading to rapidity ordering of the transverse momenta of outgoing partons .",
    "the bfkl scheme has no such strong ordering and therefore results in anomalously large high @xmath65 hadron yields away from the photon vertex , for example at central rapidity .",
    "the central region of the @xmath4 frame corresponds to the forward region of laboratory rapidity .",
    "both h1 and zeus have studied the production of jets in this difficult forward region @xcite . h1",
    "have also measured the cross section for high @xmath65 forward @xmath66 production @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions are reached in each case .",
    "the zeus forward jet data are shown in figure  [ bfklfigs]a .",
    "the data can not be described by standard dglap models ( labelled lepto and herwig ) .",
    "only models that do not impose strong transverse momentum ordering are able to describe the data .",
    "one example is the ariadne model @xcite , based on the colour dipole model and simulating bfkl ordering .",
    "however , the lack of strong @xmath67 ordering can also be modelled through the introduction of partonic structure to the virtual photon .",
    "this can be implemented in the rapgap @xcite monte carlo model , giving a successful description of all forward region data produced at hera to date .",
    "thus the final state data from the forward region at hera demonstrate that something more than the simplest dglap model of the low-@xmath1 parton ladder is required",
    ". however , resolved virtual photons provide an alternative mechanism to bfkl to restore a good description of the data .",
    "work on events with large rapidity separations between pairs of jets , just beginning at the tevatron , may help to resolve some of these ambiguities .",
    "( 120,76 ) ( -1,0 ) ( 76,0 ) ( 56,61 ) ( 105,30 )    in appropriate kinematic regions , total , elastic and diffractive cross sections may all be describable in terms of the amplitude for elastic parton - parton scattering via the exchange of gluon ladders , evolving according to bfkl dynamics .",
    "bfkl calculations are most reliable where large scales are present at both vertices @xcite .",
    "one example is the total @xmath68 cross section @xcite . where both photons have sufficiently high virtuality , measurement conditions at lep are favourable and",
    "first data have appeared @xcite .",
    "the data suggest a relatively strong energy dependence , which may be consistent with bfkl predictions .",
    "however the present data can be described equally well by non - bfkl qcd models , for example those involving virtual photon structure @xcite .",
    "another process where large scales are present at both vertices is diffractive scattering at large @xmath69 , where precision data are starting to appear from hera and the tevatron .",
    "the quasi elastic process @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes a vector meson and @xmath72 is a proton or low mass proton excitation has been measured for @xmath73 , @xmath23 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the results in the relatively low @xmath69 regions accessed to date are mixed , only the @xmath75 fully conforming to the bfkl predictions .",
    "the classic high @xmath69 diffractive process is the production of dijets separated by a rapidity gap , implying a net colour singlet exchange . here",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath9 is close to the jet @xmath76 and is thus very large .",
    "the size of the cross section is usually quantified as the fraction of all dijet events that have a rapidity gap between the jets .",
    "clear signals have been observed at large jet pseudorapidity separation @xmath77 both in photoproduction at hera @xcite and in @xmath30 interactions at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the gap fraction at large @xmath77 decreases with centre of mass energy , being around 0.1 at @xmath78 at hera , 0.025 at @xmath79 at the tevatron and 0.01 at @xmath80 at the tevatron .",
    "this trend is opposite to that naively expected from bfkl calculations .",
    "however , it seems likely that rapidity gap destruction due to reinteractions of beam remnants plays an important role .",
    "two very different models of these effects @xcite both predict a rapidity gap survival probability that falls with centre of mass energy in a manner that qualitatively resembles that in the data .",
    "the tevatron gap fractions have been measured as a function of jet @xmath81 as well as @xmath77 ( see figure  [ bfklfigs]b ) .",
    "the gap fraction is found to be flat or slowly rising with @xmath82 , which matches predictions based on the creation of rapidity gaps by soft colour interactions in otherwise standard dijet events @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that if rapidity gap destruction effects are included , bfkl dynamics can also describe these data @xcite .",
    "all of the measurements discussed above can be interpreted in terms of bfkl effects , yet none conclusively demonstrates the need for bfkl at present colliders .",
    "data from the upgraded tevatron and hera may allow us to resolve this question ."
