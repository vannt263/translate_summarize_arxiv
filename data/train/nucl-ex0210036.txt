    "the evolution of the space - time structure of the particle emitting source created in heavy ion collisions can be probed by measuring the azimuthal anisotropy ( e.g. , elliptic flow ) and two - particle interferometry in the final state particle distributions .",
    "elliptic flow is thought to provide information on the early stages of the collision , the nuclear equation of state and the degree of equilibration attained during the evolution of the collision @xcite , while two - particle interferometry provides information on the temporal and spatial extent of the source @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are based on data taken during the first two rhic physics runs for au - au collisions at @xmath0 130 and 200 gev .",
    "all 200 gev results presented here are preliminary .",
    "the phobos detector employs silicon pad detectors to perform tracking , vertex detection and multiplicity measurements .",
    "details of the setup and the layout of the silicon sensors can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "event triggering and the determination of the centrality were based on the information provided by two sets of scintillating paddle counters @xcite .",
    "the raw data for these analyses came in the form of energy depositions from the passage of charged particles through individual detector pads , known as hits .",
    "the hit definition and signal processing procedure used for the flow analysis is described in reference @xcite .",
    "the position of the primary collision vertex was determined on an event - by - event basis by extrapolating tracks found in the spectrometer arms and/or the vertex detector .",
    "the event plane was determined by a standard subevent technique @xcite using hits in symmetric and uniform regions of the octagonal multiplicity detector .",
    "charged particle tracks were reconstructed in the spectrometer arms using techniques described previously @xcite .",
    "pions were identified using the measured momentum and the specific ionization loss observed in the spectrometer silicon detectors .",
    "flow results from two independent analyses are presented here . in the first , known as the hit - based analysis ,",
    "the event plane was determined from hits in the single layer si multiplicity detectors and the second fourier coefficient of the hit azimuthal angle distribution ( also known as the elliptic flow ) , v@xmath1 , was evaluated by correlating the event plane to hits in a different region of the multiplicity detectors . in the second flow analysis , known as the track - based analysis ,",
    "v@xmath1 was determined by correlating the event plane to tracks found in the spectrometer arms .    for the hit - based analysis",
    ", events were chosen in a fiducial region that maximized the @xmath2 coverage and event plane sensitivity for the analysis .",
    "equal multiplicity subevents were defined in the regions @xmath3 for the event plane determination and evaluation of the event plane resolution .",
    "details of this analysis are provided in reference @xcite .",
    "results from the hit - based flow analysis are shown in figures  [ v2npartener ] and  [ v2etaener ] .",
    "the 1@xmath4 statistical errors are shown for both analyses .",
    "the 90% confidence level systematic errors are shown as boxes for the 200 gev data points . as can be seen in these two figures , the flow signal is little changed with the increase in the center - of - mass energy of the collision from 130 to 200 gev .",
    "the unique , and very nearly complete , @xmath2 coverage shown in figure  [ v2etaener ] shows a substantial drop in v@xmath1 as a function of @xmath5 that is not yet understood @xcite .    in the track - based analysis",
    ", events were chosen in a fiducial region that maximized the tracking efficiency and the reaction plane sensitivity .",
    "subevents were defined roughly in the regions @xmath6 for the event plane determination and the evaluation of the reaction plane resolution .",
    "charged tracks reconstructed in the spectrometer arms in the region @xmath7 were used to determine the elliptic flow . in detail , the track - based flow analysis is quite different from our previously released flow analysis .",
    "differences include the use of a vertex dependent reaction plane weighting and resolution correction , as well as a larger separation of the subevents in @xmath2 .",
    "the flow signal is determined as the asymmetry in the track azimuthal angle distribution measured relative to the event plane .",
    "the track - based flow results are less dependent on monte carlo corrections and less sensitive to background and non - flow correlations as compared to the hit - based flow measurements",
    ".    results from this procedure are shown in figures  [ v2cenhittrk ] and  [ v2pt ] .",
    "the graphical representation of the errors in these figures is similar to that for the first two figures .",
    "figure  [ v2cenhittrk ] shows the elliptic flow signal as a function of the number of participants for the track - based analysis overlayed with that from the hit - based analysis for 200 gev data .",
    "the two techniques agree very well .",
    "this is significant because of the differing sensitivity to background and non - flow correlations .",
    "figure  [ v2pt ] gives the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons in the 200 gev data .",
    "the saturation observed at a transverse momentum greater than 2 gev / c is similar to what was observed at 130 gev , and has been interpreted as evidence for partonic energy loss through gluon radiation in a dense system @xcite .",
    "pairs of identified same - sign pions were used to calculate the two - particle correlation functions .",
    "the results were corrected for the effects of the tracking algorithm and the coulomb repulsion of the pions .",
    "the 3-dimensional analysis of the correlation function using the bertsch - pratt parameterization was performed in the lcms frame in the region of acceptance @xmath8 and @xmath9 mev / c . for the 15% most central events , the preliminary fitted source parameters for @xmath10 ( @xmath11 )",
    "pairs are as follows : @xmath12 , r@xmath13 fm , r@xmath14 fm , r@xmath15 fm , and r@xmath16 fm .",
    "the errors listed are statistical only .",
    "in addition , there are systematic errors of @xmath17 on the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 fm on the radii .",
    "the results reported here are similar to those observed in au - au collisions at @xmath0 130 gev @xcite .",
    "recent phobos measurements of elliptic flow and two - particle correlations in au - au collisions at @xmath0 200 gev are very similar to values observed at @xmath0 130 gev .",
    "notably , the new results at 200 gev clearly show a saturation of v@xmath1 for p@xmath20 gev / c and a dramatic drop of v@xmath1 as a function of @xmath5 .",
