    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method has been extensively used as a powerful technique for calculating some physical properties of many - body systems @xcite , such as molecules @xcite , solids @xcite , and nanostructures @xcite . for molecules",
    ", it has been reported that the diffusion qmc method can achieve near chemical accuracy within the fixed - node approximation @xcite .    while variational and diffusion qmc algorithms usually sample only electrons at zero temperature , path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) can sample both the ions and electrons simultaneously at finite temperature .",
    "this is a promising approach to calculate thermal effects in the molecular systems .",
    "additionally , pimc includes the zero - point motion of the ions , yeilding the correct quantum statistical treatment of the motion of light ions at all temperatures .",
    "we note that another approach , coupled electron - ionic monte carlo ( ceimc ) @xcite , has been demonstrated in which electrons and ions are sampled in two independent but coupled monte carlo algorithms . for",
    "the molecule we study in this paper , a comparable ceimc simulation would have a ground - state variational or diffusion qmc simulation of the electrons that determines the born - oppenheimer energy surface .",
    "these qmc electron energies would then be used in a path integral simulation for the protons .",
    "because the qmc estimates of ground - state electronic energies have statistical error bars , a penalty - method @xcite would be used to partially compensate for non - linear biases when these energies are fed into the ionic path integral monte carlo .",
    "ultimately , the ceimc method requires a fairly accurate determination of total energies at many points on the born - oppenheimer surface for many different configurations of the ion positions .    in this paper",
    "we address the following issue : by treating electrons and ions in the same path integral simulation ( avoiding the explicit calculation of the born - oppenheimer energy surface ) , can we extract properties of a molecule , such as bond - lengths , vibrational frequencies , and polarizability ? these properties are often calculated directly from the born - openheimer surface , i.e. bond - lengths and vibrational frequencies come from local minima and curvature of the energy surface . here",
    "we treat these properties as expectation values of the electron - ion thermal density matrix .",
    "that is , we do not make the born - oppenheimer approximation , instead , we sample the electron and ion coordinates in a single path integral .",
    "the calculations presented here are a proof - of - concept , demonstrating how to extract physical properties from the pimc simulations .",
    "the question of the relative efficiencies of this approach and ceimc will have to be left to future calculations on larger systems , most likely requiring some kind of a path - integral fixed - node approximation @xcite .    in pimc simulations we can collect various correlation function of the system in imaginary time .",
    "these functions , known as finite temperature matsubura green s functions , can be transformed from the imaginary - time domain into the imaginary - frequencies through the fast fourier transform ( fft ) . since we want to calculate the physical properties of the systems , the correlation function at real frequency need to be obtained from the imaginary - frequency function .",
    "it is possible through the analytic continuation techniques to obtain real - time correlation function from imaginary - time correlation function , since a time - ordered correlation function is an analytic function of the time variable in the complex plane @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the time - correlation function calculated along the imaginary axis can be uniquely analytically continued to the real - time axis .",
    "for the case of the simple and closed correlation function , the analytic continuation of imaginary - frequency correlation function is simply the replacement of @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "but for realistic correlation functions in molecules it is hard to find the closed form of imaginary - frequency correlation function .",
    "therefore analytic continuations need to be performed with numerical methods .",
    "however , the analytic continuation of numerically evaluated correlation functions often leads to grossly amplified statistical errors in the real time correlation function .",
    "some numerical methods have been proposed for reducing the statistical errors , such as using pad approximations @xcite or least - squares fitting @xcite , minimizing a suitably defined potential @xcite , maximum - entropy @xcite , and singular value decomposition ( svd ) methods @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the rotational constant of a molecule can be obtained by fitting imaginary - time correlation function from pimc data to analytic models of correlation function @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that some properties of molecules can be sampled directly from path integral simulations using matsubura green s functions . for an accurate treatment of the coulomb interactions between particles we use a new method to tabulate of the coulomb density matrix that we have developed . using correlation functions sampled with the accurate coulomb propagator",
    ", we demonstrate pimc calculations of the bond length , vibrational frequency , and polarizability of a hydrogen molecule .",
    "this calculations are important benchmarks for future calculations on more complicated systems .",
    "in particular , we have chosen a simple system without a fermion sign - problem so that we can separate the analysis of correlation functions from questions about the fixed - node approximation .",
    "in thermal equilibrium , the average value of any physical quantity can be calculated from the density matrix . in the coordinate representation ,",
    "the thermal density matrix of @xmath3 particles is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature , @xmath6 are the particle coordinates , @xmath7 is the position of the @xmath8-th particle , and @xmath9 is the partition function .",

    "we estimate this high dimensional integral with metropolis monte carlo algorithm , with an efficient multilevel sampling method . for a detailed discussion of pimc methods , see reference @xcite .      the primitive approximation to the path integral , eq .",
    "( [ eq : primative ] ) , is not correct for attractive coulomb interactions . instead",
    ", we use an improved quantum action @xmath16 in place of the bare coulomb potential @xmath17 . the use of improved actions is discussed in reference @xcite .    in order to more accurately describe the coulomb interactions",
    "we have developed a new technique for tabulation of imaginary - time coulomb green s function @xcite , from which we extract the coulomb action .",
    "the green s function , @xmath18 for two particles in @xmath3-dimensional space satisfies the equation , @xmath19g^{(n)}({\\mathbf r},{\\mathbf r}';\\tau ) =   -\\frac{d}{d\\tau}g^{(n)}({\\mathbf r},{\\mathbf r}';\\tau).\\ ] ] the initial condition is @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 refer to the relative separation of two particles with reduced mass @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the product of the charges .",
    "there are several ways to numerically evaluate green s function , see reference @xcite .",
    "but each methods has its particular limitation and numerical errors are often more than one percent .    since the coulomb potential , @xmath25 , has the symmetry properties , without a partial wave expansion we are able to simple , fast , and highly accurate numerical evaluation of @xmath26 using one - dimensional fft s .",
    "the technique relies on hostler s recursion relation @xcite , which relates the @xmath3-dimensional green s function to the 1-dimensional function .",
    "the use of an accurate coulomb action is especially important in chemistry .",
    "an analogy can be drawn to the use of accurate integration schemes in molecular dynamics . in the current work",
    ", we find that quantities , such as the molecular binding energy and electrical polarizability are especially sensitive to the quality of the tabulated coulomb action .",
    "there are several estimators to obtain the total thermal energy of a system .",
    "the most widely used energy estimator is the thermodynamic energy estimator , which is obtained by differentiating the partition function with respect to @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the partition function and @xmath30 is the action . in other words ,",
    "the thermal energy is an average value of the imaginary - time derivative of the action .    for the calculation of molecules we used the virial energy estimator .",
    "the virial estimator of the energy is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the deviation of the @xmath8-th particle from its average position , and @xmath33 is a generalization of the classical force , @xmath34 for more detailed derivation , see references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the general description of the static polarization of molecules is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the applied electric field , @xmath37 is the static polarizability tensor of the molecule , and @xmath23 and @xmath38 denote vector directions . for diatomic molecules , symmetry reduces the polarizability tensor to reduced into two components , the parallel ( @xmath39 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath40 ) polarizability .    using the polarization estimator @xmath41 we calculate the static polarizability of the molecules given the electric field . here",
    "@xmath42 is the position of the @xmath8-th particle in the direction of @xmath23 , and @xmath43 is the magnitude of the the electric field in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "the matsubura green s function method is a very useful technique for calculating the physical properties of many - body systems at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the general definition of temperature green s function is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the time - ordering operator , @xmath46 represent the imaginary time , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are operators .",
    "the bracket means the thermal average value at the inverse temperature @xmath49 .",
    "if the hamiltonian of the system is independent of time , green s function becomes only a function of the time difference @xmath50 , so it also can be written @xmath51 .",
    "a fourier transform gives the frequency dependence of green s function for bosonic quantities , such as molecular vibrations and polarizabilites , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the linear response theory , the linear response of the system to a small perturbation",
    "can be written in terms of the green s function .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction section , through analytical continuation , matsubura green s function of complex frequencies , @xmath1 , can be analytically continued to real , time - ordered correlation functions , which determine physical properties of the dynamic system .",
    "however , in numerical analytic continuation even small noise on imaginary - time correlation can make big statistical errors in real time dynamics of the system @xcite . instead of that",
    ", we analyze directly the imaginary - time correlation function calculated by path integral monte carlo method in order to obtain some properties of molecules . to calculate bond - length and vibrational frequency , we use displacement - displacement imaginary - time correlation functions and their fourier transforms .",
    "for polarizability of molecules we use polarization - polarization correlation function .      for calculating of the bond - length and vibrational frequencies of molecules we use the displacement - displacement correlation function",
    ". the displacement correlation function of a harmonic oscillator , with @xmath55 , in the imaginary - time domain at the inverse temperature @xmath27 can be written @xmath56 where @xmath57 refers to the displacement of the oscillator from equilibrium . for @xmath58 ,",

    "the mass , @xmath13 is the reduced mass of two protons . at low temperature , we assume that the molecule is in harmonic motion , so we compare our results with the simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "we are able to extract the bond length from imaginary - time displacement - displacement correlation function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phonongf ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath63 can measure the fluctuation in the quantity @xmath64 . at @xmath65 ,",
    "the initial value of @xmath66 is the equilibrium average @xmath67 .",
    "as time goes on , the correlation function shows the time decay which measure how @xmath57 and @xmath68 are correlated each other . in the long time",
    "limit , the correlation function becomes totally uncorrelated so that the correlation function can be written as , @xmath69 at @xmath70 , @xmath71 is approximately @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the bond length of the molecule at low temperature .",
    "since the bond length can be directly computed as a time - independent average , this limit is an important sanity check on our imaginary - time data .    to obtain the vibrational frequency of molecules we use imaginary - frequency correlation function . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fft ] ) , we can obtain the correlation function of the simple harmonic oscillator in the imaginary - frequency space , @xmath74 \\\\               = & \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\bigg [ \\frac{-1/m}{(\\omega_n)^2+\\omega_{\\mathtt{sho}}^2 } \\bigg ]       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "once we have the correlation function , we can calculate the vibrational frequency @xmath75 at @xmath76 , @xmath77 at each temperatures @xmath27 .    another way to find the frequency is to directly use the correlation function . since the correlation function @xmath78 forms a lorentzian in the imaginary axis of complex green s function , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the correlation function is equal to the frequency of the harmonic oscillator",
    ". therefore we can compare to these frequencies using two methods .",
    "we use the polarization - polarization correlation function to calculate the polarizability of molecules .",
    "the imaginary - time correlation function can be written @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "once we have obtained the imaginary - time correlation function , by fourier transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : fft ] ) we can calculated the dynamic polarizability .    similar to the bond - length calculation , first we calculate the polarizability for a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "( note that this oscillator is a model for our polarization analysis and is not related to molecular vibrations . ) from linear responses theory the static susceptibility @xmath81 , due to the small electric field perturbation @xmath82 , can be written with the first order perturbation theory , @xmath83 it is clear that the polarizability depends on the confinement potential of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath84 .",
    "we can also obtain the polarizability from the imaginary - frequency polarization - polarization correlation function .",
    "the correlation function for the simple harmonic oscillator is @xmath85    similar to bond length estimator , we assume that the molecules are in the harmonic motion .",
    "once we obtain @xmath86 , the polarizability @xmath87 is the value at @xmath88 .",
