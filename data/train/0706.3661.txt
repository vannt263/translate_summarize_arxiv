    "in this section , we discuss about our model and some basic considerations which one needs to study thermodynamic equilibrium properties of single domain particles .",
    "kittle has shown that below a critical size , domain wall formation is energetically unfavourable @xcite .",
    "this kind of particles are called single domain particles . in the absence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "a bulk ferromagnet may have no net magnetization due to the cancellation from different domains .",
    "but , a single domain particle acts as a giant magnetic moment and the magnetic moment per particle depends on the particle volume and the number of atoms it has . throughout this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the thermodynamic properties of a collection of such monodomain particles which are dispersed in solid matrix @xcite .",
    "further , we restrict our study to mathematically tractable systems with axially symmetric magneto - anisotropy .",
    "but , it provides valuable insights into more complex situations .",
    "all our considerations are based on the stoner - wohlfarth model for single domain particles @xcite . in this model ,",
    "all spins within the particle are aligned due to exchange interaction and this is the dominating magnetostatic effect within the particle .",
    "the giant magnetic moment direction fluctuates , because the anisotropy energy is comparable to thermal energy .",
    "the direction of the moment is determined by the net anisotropy of the system and energy is minimized .",
    "this magnetization reversal process occurs by coherent rotation i.e. the atomic spins remain parallel to each other as they rotate to a new direction @xcite . here",
    ", we are considering ideal monodomain particles in which other more complex interactions both within the particles and between the particles are neglected .",
    "thus , our system has only magnetocrystaline energy and zeeman energy due to the interaction with external field .",
    "+ now , we need to specify the validity of this model , especially in which temperature range it is valid .",
    "to specify this temperature range , we follow the arguments given by j. l. garca palacios @xcite .",
    "it has already been mentioned that the thermal equilibrium behaviour of ideal monodomain particles with uniaxial anisotropy is observed when @xmath24 . from equation ( 1 )",
    ", one can easily understand that thermal equilibrium behaviour exists when anisotropic potential barrier , @xmath25 , much larger than the thermal energy , @xmath26 .",
    "besides , the  high - barrier \" regime , equation ( 1 ) still holds down to @xmath27 .",
    "it is known that @xmath9 for magnetic nanoparticles is @xmath28 sec .",
    "thus , the thermal equilibrium range for a given measurement time , @xmath14 , is given by @xmath29 .",
    "for magnetic measurements , @xmath30 sec and the thermal equilibrium range is quite wide @xmath31 .",
    "so , the frequently encountered statement that the thermal equilibrium behaviour occurs when @xmath32 is needlessly constrictive . for example , if @xmath33 sec ( typical value for magnetic measurements ) , one finds that @xmath34 . for @xmath35",
    ", one can obtain @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the system is in thermal equilibrium , but @xmath25 is still much larger than @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we consider a collection of non - interacting single domain magnetic particles . in a single domain particle , nearly @xmath37 magnetic moments",
    "are coherently locked together in a given direction thus yielding a supermoment . in this nanomagnetic system , every particle consists of a single magnetic domain with all its atomic moments are rotating coherently and resulting in a constant absolute value of magnetization @xmath38 , where @xmath12 is the volume of the particle and @xmath39 is the saturation magnetization which is supposed to be independent of particle volume and temperature . in our system ,",
    "the hamiltonian consists of two parts , one representing the zeeman energy and the other is the anisotropic energy ( due to the crystalline structure of the particle ) . for the sake of simplicity , we consider a temperature independent uniaxial anisotropy . denoting the external applied magnetic field as @xmath40",
    ", the hamiltonian is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a unit vector along the anisotropy axis , @xmath43 is the magnetic moment of the single domain particle and @xmath40 is the direction of the external magnetic field as shown in fig . 1 and @xmath11 is the anisotropy constant .",
    "this model is valid only if the exchange interaction strength of the system is much larger than @xmath11 and @xmath2 . now denoting @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the angular co - ordinates of @xmath43 and @xmath40 respectively and choosing @xmath42 as the polar axis of the spherical polar co - ordinate system",
    ", one can write the total magnetic potential in the form as follows , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath13 is the boltzman constant and @xmath3 is the temperature of the system .",
    "one can rewrite eq .",
    "( 3 ) as follows @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "expressions for the magnetization curve where anisotropy is included have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "this calculation is based on the theory of hanson _ et al _ @xcite and respaud @xcite . for uniaxial anisotropic nanomagnetic system",
    ", the anisotropy energy depends only on the angle between the magnetization and the direction of easy magnetization in the particle , @xmath21 . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the magnetization in the direction of @xmath43 is proportional to the boltzmann factor for a fixed orientation of the easy axis : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 are the unit vectors along the direction of magnetic moment and the external magnetic field and @xmath57 is the partition function defined by @xmath58 thus , we have @xmath59 using the boltzmann statistics , the expectation value of the reduced magnetization with a given orientation of the easy axis is given by @xmath60 none of the integrations in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is doable analytically .",
    "however , equation ( 9 ) can be simplified by using the modified bessel functions and performing the analytic integration over @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the magnetization of such a collection of non - interacting identical particles aligned with an angle @xmath0 with respect to @xmath2 is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the modified bessel function of order 0 and 1 respectively .",
    "considering random distribution of anisotropy axes one can show @xmath66 however , there will be a distribution of particle sizes in any real fine particle system .",
    "the existance of particle size distribution can be taken into account by taking average over the full particle size distribution .",
    "thus , the magnetization of such a system with a distribution of particle sizes is consists of the sum of contributions from the superparamagnetic and the blocked particles .",
    "the weightage of these two is maintained by the size distribution function of the particles , @xmath67 .",
    "now , the magnetization for this polydispersive system is given by @xmath68 where y is the reduced volume @xmath69 with the mean volume @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is the critical volume for superparamagnetism which is given by @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are the reduced magnetization for the superparamagnetic and blocked particles respectively .",
    "it is known that @xmath76 where langevin function @xmath77 .",
    "usually such anisotropic nanomagnetic system follows log - normal distribution of particle size i.e. @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the dispersion of the corresponding distribution . for the numerical integration",
    ", we have used the following parameters : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and average blocking temperature , @xmath82 , @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 is measured in units of @xmath83 , and @xmath23 is measured in units of @xmath84 . +",
    "numerical integration programme in fortran are performed to calculate magnetization for the monodispersive and the polydispersive system by using equation ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) respectively .",
    "static magnetic susceptibility of the polydispersive system is defined as @xmath85 now , we have defined our system and other essential thermodynamic functions . in the next two sections ,",
    "we analyze the thermodynamic behaviour of such magneto - anisotropic nanomagnetic system .",
    "in this section , we discuss about the behaviour of the magnetic potential energy as a function of the several parameters used in the hamiltonian of the present nanomagnetic system .",
    "the variation of equilibrium angle , @xmath21 , between magnetic moment and easy axis of magnetization as a function of @xmath23 is also studied in this section .",
    "one can rewrite equation ( 4 ) as follows @xmath86 where @xmath51 .",
    "the stationary points for equation ( 17 ) occurs for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the stationary point for @xmath88 corresponds to a maximum , so it is of no physical interest . on the other hand",
    ", stationary point @xmath89 corresponds to a maxima at @xmath90 and minima at @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "one can determine two equilibrium directions of the magnetization associated with polar angles @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( lie in the x - z plane ) from the following condition @xmath93 and the saddle point is determined by @xmath94 on the other hand , one can determine the critical value of the ratio of field to barrier height ( @xmath95 ) at which the potential loses its bistable character by using the following condition @xmath96 using equation ( 20 ) , one can easily show that @xcite @xmath97 one can rewrite equation ( 21 ) as follows @xmath98 it can be shown that @xmath99 lies in the range @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 occurs for @xmath102 or @xmath103 . whereas @xmath104 can be seen for @xmath105 .",
    "it is very unlikely that one can derive all the derivatives and hence the barrier heights ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to derive barrier heights and to know the nature of the potential for some particular values of @xmath0 . for @xmath102 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "thus the potential has the asymmetric bistable form as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this asymmetric potential becomes symmetric and the barrier height becomes @xmath110 for @xmath111 ( see figure 2(c ) ) .",
    "again for @xmath112 , the potential becomes asymmetric bistable below @xmath113 ( see figure 2(b ) ) and the barrier heights become @xcite @xmath114 and @xmath115 . for @xmath116 , one can show that @xmath117 and @xmath118 and is just the opposite of the case for @xmath102 ( see figure 2(d ) ) .",
    "in general the potential retains its asymmetric bistable character for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "+ it is evident from fig .",
    "( 2 ) that the potential energy of this nanomagnetic system has two minima separated by a maxima if and only if @xmath23 is less than a ceratin critical value ( @xmath95 ) which varies from @xmath121 for @xmath122 to @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "so , the system consists of two potential barriers @xmath106 and @xmath107 which are in general unequal except for the case of @xmath125 . if @xmath126 the bistable character of the potential disappears and the system has only a single maxima or a single minima . at @xmath127 ,",
    "the second minima becomes a point of inflexion which is clearly seen in figure ( 2 ) .",
    "+      here , we are considering a collection of non - interacting magnetic single - domain nanoparticles in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the variation of the equilibrium angle between the anisotropy axis and the magnetic moment , @xmath21 , versus @xmath23 for such a collection of noninteracting nanomagnetic system is shown in fig .",
    "3 . now , using the maxima and minima condition of @xmath128 as defined by equation ( 18 ) and equation ( 19 ) , one can obtain the equilibrium angle for the magnetization direction in the x - z plane for some specific values of @xmath0 .    finally , the expression for the equilibrium angle @xmath21 for @xmath87 under different orientations of @xmath0 are as follows : + ( i ) for @xmath129 and @xmath87 : + @xmath130 i.e @xmath128 has minima at @xmath131 and maxima at @xmath132",
    ". + ( ii ) for @xmath122 and @xmath87 , + the minima of the potential are at @xmath133 and at @xmath134 . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic potential has maxima at @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "+ ( iii ) for @xmath1 and @xmath87 , + @xmath128 has minima at @xmath136 and @xmath137 and maxima at @xmath138 .",
    "+ ( iv ) and finally for @xmath139 and @xmath87 one can show that minima of the magnetic potential are at @xmath140 and maxima at @xmath141 .",
    "3 , we plot these solutions as a function of @xmath23 . figure 3(a ) shows that @xmath90 for @xmath142 increases from @xmath143 to @xmath144 as @xmath23 is altered from @xmath145 to @xmath146 . on the other hand , @xmath90 for @xmath147 decreases from @xmath144 to @xmath143 as @xmath23",
    "is varied from @xmath145 to @xmath146 ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) . from figure 3(c ) , it is evident that as @xmath23 is varied from @xmath145 to @xmath146 , @xmath91 increases from @xmath148 to @xmath149 ( black filled circle ) and @xmath92 decreases from @xmath150 to @xmath149 ( blue filled square ) .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "3(d ) that @xmath91 ( black filled circle ) and @xmath90 ( blue filled square ) increases monotonically to a maximum value of @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively at @xmath113 ; on the other hand , @xmath92 decreases monotonically to a minimum value of @xmath152 at @xmath113 ( red filled triangle ) .",
    "magnetization and susceptibility are the most fundamental thermodynamical quantities of non - interacting magnetic nanoparticles with axially symmetric magnetic anisotropy . in this section ,",
    "we analyze about the variation of these two fundamental quantities with temperature and externally applied magnetic field .",
    "the differences and similarities of the magnetization and susceptibility between the ideal superparamagnetic system and a colletion of noninteracting anisotropic monodomain particles are presented here .",
    "+      the magnetization along the direction of the external magnetic field for classical spins with axially symmetric magnetic anisotropy is defined by equation ( 13 ) .",
    "we illustrate this magnetization as a function of @xmath22 using equation ( 13 ) for a system of identical noninteracting monodomain particles for different values of @xmath153 in fig .",
    "4 .    one can easily observe that magnetization curves differ from the langevin law in all the cases .",
    "as @xmath153 decreases , the difference vanishes and with the increase of @xmath153 , the magnetization curves become closer to the ising case . in the limits of high and low field , @xmath22 , magnetization , @xmath154 , approaches the langevin value .",
    "the largest influence of anisotropy can be observed in the intermediate field regime .",
    "this confirms the non - langevin behaviour of a collection of noninteracting magneto - anisotropic single domain particles .    in fig . 5",
    ", we show the variation of magnetization with reduced temperature , @xmath155 , for two different values of @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath83 is the average blocking temperature of the system @xcite . for convenience",
    ", we also plot the magnetization curves for the ising and langevin cases .",
    "it is clear that magnetization versus temperature curves for the anisotropic magnetic nanoparticle system show maximum near @xmath156 unlike the ising and langevin cases .",
    "this maximum can be interpreted as follows . from equation",
    "( 14 ) , one can observe that @xmath157 has two parts , the superparamagnetic contribution and the blocked particle contribution .",
    "as the temperature increases the fraction of the superparamagnetic contribution increases till temperature reaches the blocking temperature .",
    "now , above this blocking temperature at which maximum in magnetization is observed , the system usually becomes superparamagnetic and magnetization decreases rapidly with the increase of temperature due to the thermal agitation .",
    "thus , in equilibrium and for @xmath158 , one can observe maximum in magnetization for the polydisperse magneto - anisotropic nanoparticle system .",
    "one can observe that the maximum of the peak is exactly not at @xmath159 , but with the increase of field it shifts to lower relative temperature i.e. maximum are seen at @xmath160 and at @xmath161 for @xmath162 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "also one can notice that as the field increases , the peak becomes broader .",
    "+      in order to demonstrate the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy on the thermodynamical quantities , we demonstrate the behavior of susceptibility of the non - interacting nanoparticles in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we plot the susceptibility and inverse susceptibility curves with respect to temperature for different orientations in @xmath0 between the anisotropy axis and external field in fig . 6 and fig .",
    "7 respectively .",
    "again , susceptibility shows a maximum at finite temperatures ( @xmath163 and @xmath161 ) for @xmath162 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "also , as the field increases the peak of the susceptibility curves become more broader . in order to demonstrate the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy",
    ", we illustrate the behavior of inverse susceptibility of the noninteracting nanoparticles with reduced temperature in the presence of an external magnetic field for different orientations of @xmath0 between the anisotropy axis and external field in figure 7 . for @xmath164 ( in black circle )",
    ", one observes a susceptibility curve resembling a system with ferromagnetic like interaction and it follows curie - weiss law . the same kind of ferromagnetic like coupling is prevailed for @xmath165 ( in orange square ) and for @xmath166 ( in pink upward triangle ) .",
    "this means the zero crossing at temperature axis occurs at positive values .",
    "when the angle between the anisotropy axis and magnetic field is @xmath122 ( in red downward triangle ) , the system resembles paramagnetic behavior and it follows simple curie law .",
    "however , for @xmath1 ( in blue diamond ) and for @xmath167 ( green filled square ) , a curie - weiss antiferromagnetic - like behavior is observed . by extrapolating one",
    "can observe the zero crossing in the temperature axis at negative values .",
    "thus , the extrapolating transition temperature continuously changes from positive values to negative values .    from this kind of observation",
    ", one can conclude that the anisotropy field acts as a ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic like coupling among the magnetic nanoparticles depending on the relative angle between the anisotropy axis and the external field .",
    "the net effect of the anisotropy field resembles a continupus transition from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic like coupling .",
    "in conclusion , we have confirmed that a collection of noninteracting magneto - anisotropic particles can not be described with the help of the classical langevin theory , i.e. , their thermodynamic equilibrium magnetization and static magnetic susceptibility can not be described by the langevin function and its derivative .",
    "this deviation is due to the presence of magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "the effect of magnetocrystalline anisotropy is explored through magnetization curves and susceptibility curves .",
    "the variation of inverse susceptibility with temperature shows paramagnetic , ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic coupling behaviour for different orientations of @xmath0 .",
    "we also present a mechanical analogy for a system in 3d as a frictionless particle moving on a sphere rotating about its vertical diameter .",
    "this study reveals the essential role of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy in interpreting equilibrium magnetization and susceptibility of a collection of non - interacting single domain nanomagnetic particles .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss about the mechanical isomorph of the nanomagnetic system .",
    "we consider a rigid sphere of radius @xmath168 rotating along its vertical diameter at angular frequency @xmath169 with a frictionless particle of mass @xmath170 free to move on the surface of the sphere . in the rotating co - ordinate frame",
    "@xmath171 attached to the rigid sphere , in addition to the gravitational force on the mass @xmath172 , a fictitious centrifugal force @xmath173 is acting on the particle and is given by @xmath174 .",
    "an external field @xmath175 is acting on the azimuthal plane such that @xmath176 .",
    "now , the kinetic energy of the particle is given by @xmath177 the potential energy of the particle consists of three parts @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is coming from the gravitational force field part , @xmath180 is the fictitious centrifugal part and @xmath181 is the external field part .",
    "now , one can easily find out the three parts of the effective potential energy as follows : @xmath182 thus the lagrangian of the system becomes @xmath183 now , the effective potential energy which includes the effect of gravity , rotation of the system and the external field force @xmath175 is given by @xmath184 comparing equations ( 3 ) and ( 27 ) one can easily understand the analogy between the mechanical system and the magnetic nanoparticle system .",
    "the centripetal acceleration plays the role of the magnetic anisotropy , whereas the combined effect of external field @xmath175 and the gravity field is equivalent to the external magnetic field .",
