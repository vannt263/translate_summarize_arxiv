    "quasi one dimensional two - leg ladders sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ca@xmath7 ) have been intensively investigated over the last years due to their fascinating physical properties.@xcite spin ladders sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 have a spin - liquid ground state with a finite spin - gap@xcite and antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order@xcite coexisting with spin singlets and hole pairs at low @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , for samples with the largest ca concentration , an applied pressure in the range 30 - 80 kbar stabilizes a superconducting ground state in the ladder planes with a transition temperature passing through a maximum at 10 k around 40 kbar .",
    "@xcite consequently , clarifying the interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in doped antiferromagnets is a very important matter for understanding the onset of a superconducting state in spin ladders as well as in high-@xmath12 superconductors .",
    "the sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 system is intrinsically hole doped as the stoichiometry implies an average copper valency of 2.25 .",
    "the redistribution of the preexisting holes among chains and ladders in this composite system , depending on the ca content , applied pressure and temperature is one of the most important factor which controls the physical properties ( in particular superconductivity ) of these spin - ladders .",
    "optical measurements@xcite and the calculation of the madelung potentials @xcite have shown that for the @xmath13 compound holes are staying essentially in the chains providing a valency of 2.06 for the ladder cu sites .",
    "their localization in the chains leads to an insulating behavior .",
    "in addition , upon ca substitution holes are transferred from the chains to the ladders .",
    "@xcite at the same time , the longitudinal conductivity ( along the c - axis ) increases , leading to quasi one dimensional ( q-1-d ) metallic properties .",
    "@xcite this hole transfer can be caused by the reduction of the distance between chains and ( sr , ca ) layers , @xcite which results in an enhancement of the electrostatic potentials in the chains.@xcite experimentally , however , the precise amount of hole transfer is still under discussion .",
    "osafune _ et al_.@xcite have found that the copper valency in the ladders increases from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 holes per cu ) when @xmath7 increases from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the systematic measurements of the @xmath0cu nuclear spin - spin relaxation time @xmath19 ( ref . ) probing the spin correlation length has shown that holes were doped into cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ladder with a content of @xmath20 , 0.22 and 0.25 holes per cu for @xmath7=6 , 9 and 11.5 , respectively .",

    ". moreover , isobe _",
    "et al_.@xcite found that holes located in the ladders tend to move back into the chains at low temperature and that almost all holes were located in the chains near the liquid - he temperature .",
    "a similar estimate for the hole content @xmath24 for the ca12 compound has been recently deduced from polarization - dependent @xmath25-ray absorption data by ncker _",

    "they have related the changes in @xmath27 to the variation in the effective hole concentration @xmath28 in the cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ladder layer and have found a        decrease of the hole number in cu@xmath8o@xmath9 going to low temperature for all @xmath7 values .",
    "in addition , they have noticed only a small increase of the hole density of @xmath29 in the ladders layer going from ca0 to ca8 .",
    "the main effect of ca doping on the structure of sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 is a reduction of the @xmath30 parameter .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by analyzing the effect of hydrostatic pressure.@xcite it is the @xmath30 parameter which is most sensitive to pressure .",
    "hence , we can expect an increase of the ladder hole density to take place as pressure is increased .",
    "this assumption is in agreement with the decrease of the electrical resistivity observed in refs . under high pressure .",
    "experimentally , however , quantitative estimates for the hole number transferred into the ladder subsystem under high pressure are still missing .    in order to address such a question the present work attempts to provide an experimental determination of the hole distribution among ladder and chain subsystems as a function of temperature , doping , and pressure .",
    "the latter point is crucial since pressure is a prerequisite for the stabilization of superconductivity in sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "we present detailed copper and oxygen nmr studies of the nuclear quadrupole interaction tensor , @xmath2 , in ca0 and ca12 single crystal samples at ambient pressure and under the pressure of 32 kbar which can drive the ca12 system to the situation where superconductivity is stabilized at low temperature .",

    "dependence of the hole number per ladder cu in the cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ladder transferred from the cuo@xmath8 chains ( left vertical axis ) and of the total hole concentration after calibration with the nexafs data , _ see text _ ( right vertical axis ) .",

    "[ orbhvst](a ) the number of holes @xmath28 transferred into the ladder plane of sr@xmath31cu@xmath5o@xmath6 was assumed arbitrarily to be zero at low @xmath11 .",
    "the overall tendency for the hole density in the ladders is a decrease at low temperature .",
    "such a decrease can happen for the following reason : the backtransfer of holes from ladders to chains . in this respect",
    ", we could ascribe the temperature of @xmath139 below which on fig.[o2nqvst]a @xmath140 becomes temperature independent to the onset of a cdw state@xcite ( or a hole crystallization@xcite ) in the ladders of ca0 .",
    "however , such an effect is not so clearly observed in the hole number on the cu1 sites .",
    "in addition we can rule out such an interpretation for the sudden drop of the hole number in ca12 around @xmath141 since for this compound the cdw ground state is no longer stable at low temperature@xcite .",
    "the backtransfer of charges from the ladders to the chains as temperature is lowered , when the distance between the chains and the ladders is shortened seems to contradict the fact that a shrinkage of the intersheet cuo@xmath8-cu@xmath8o@xmath9 distance leads to a hole transfer towards the ladders .",
    "this discrepancy has been recently resolved by isobe _",
    "et al_. @xcite these authors have shown that it is the minimum o3-cu1 distance of the modulated structure which governs the hole density in the ladders .",
    "moreover , in spite of the average o3-cu1 distance becoming shorter at low temperature the minimum does expands .",
    "this expansion leads in turn to a reverse hole transfer from ladders to chains .    using the bond - valence sum calculation , isobe _",
    "et al_.@xcite have obtained that the ladder layer of the ca13.6 compound contains 1.3 holes per formula unit ( _ f.u_. ) ( _ i.e. _ 0.092 hole per cu1 ) at room temperature .",
    "in addition , according to this calculation , as the temperature is lowered down to 5 k nearly all holes ( @xmath1421 hole per _ f.u_. or 0.07 hole per cu1 ) move back to the chains .",
    "we note that our results give for ca12 a much smaller fraction ( 0.28 holes per _ f.u_. or 0.02 hole per cu1 ) of the holes moving back into the chains with decreasing temperature . furthermore , since we only see in the nmr / nqr spectrum the contribution from evenly distributed holes@xcite , our results indicate that a rather substantial number of holes in ca12 is remaining on the ladders ( possibly delocalized ) even down to the lowest temperature .",
    "supporting the possibility that not all holes in the ca - rich samples are backtransferred from the ladders to the chains at low @xmath11 is the observation of an antiferromagnetic long - range ordering taking place in the chains of ca - rich ( @xmath143 ) spin ladders . in the case",
    "when six holes per _",
    "f.u_. are located in chains , spin - singlet dimers form and antiferromagnetic long - range order does not take place in chains .",
    "it is the situation which prevails in ca - poor compounds with @xmath144 ( ref . ) .",
    "the * presence * of af order in the chains of the ca - rich ladders can serve as an indication that the hole number in the chains is less than 6 holes per _ f.u_. in that event , `` lone '' spins and/or `` spin - trimers '' can form in the chains inducing staggered spin modulations on the remaining spin singlets and af long - range order in the spin liquid state is established .",
    "we have obtained that an increase of the ca content up to 12 atoms per _ f.u_. leads to only a small increase of the hole density in the ladder layer ( @xmath145 hole / cu1 ) .",
    "this value is much smaller than the 0.16 hole / cu1 found in optical conductivity measurements of osafune _ et al . _ for ca12@xcite but",
    "is quite close to the value 0.02 hole / cu1 derived by in nexafs measurements of ncker _",
    "et al_.@xcite interestingly , although the results of ncker _ et al_. and those of osafune _ et al_. relative to the hole number in cu@xmath8o@xmath9 planes of ca - rich samples are quite different both investigations report the same absolute value @xmath146 hole / cu1 for the ca0 compound at room temperature . consequently ,",
    "if the hole density in the ladder of ca0 is really 0.06 holes per cu1 at room temperature then our results imply that 0.04 hole / cu1 still persist in the ladder plane of the ca - free sample at low @xmath11 .",
    "hence , it is necessary to add 0.04 hole / cu1 to the amount @xmath28 of holes transferred to the ladders , see fig .",
    "[ orbhvst](a ) ( left axis ) , in order to obtain the total hole number , @xmath147 , located in ladder layers as shown on the right axis of the figure .",
    "then , @xmath147(ca12 , 300k ) becomes 0.09 and 0.12 hole / cu1 at 1 bar and 32 kbar respectively .    at this stage",
    "it is interesting to compare our findings for the amount of holes sitting on the ladders in ca0 with the predictions derived from an _ ab initio _",
    "calculation by gell and lepetit.@xcite following their calculation , the number of holes on the ladders should be much smaller than 1 per _ f.u_. in order to lead to a localization of magnetic electrons in agreement with the experimental observation of dimeric units separated by zhang - rice singlets . according to fig .",
    "[ orbhvst](a ) our experiment gives 0.04 per cu1 or ( 0.56 holes per _ f.u _ ) on the ladders at low temperature .",
    "as far as the ca12 compound is concerned , our experiment gives under ambient pressure a number of 1 hole per _ f.u .",
    "_ transferred into the ladders at low temperature .",
    "this figure compares fairly well with the _ ab - initio _ calculation made for the ca13.6 system @xcite predicting a small hole transfer in - between 1 and 2 per _ f.u . _ in order to explain the existence of an antiferromagnetic ground state at low temperature in the heavily ca - substituted samples .",
    "an other important result of our study is the observation of an additional increase of @xmath147 in the ladder layer of the ca - rich compound under high pressure .",
    "the amount of increase is comparable to what is obtained at ambient pressure going from ca0 to ca12 .",
    "it is apparent , therefore , that the important role of high pressure in achieving the conditions for the stabilization of superconductivity in ca12 is an increase of the hole doping of the conducting cu@xmath8o@xmath9 planes . on the other hand",
    ", high pressure leads to only a slight transfer of holes from chains to ladders in ca - free compound ca0 .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath148(ca0 , 32 kbar , 300k)@xmath1490.0262 hole / cu1 , obtained in our experiments , is quite close to the @xmath28(ca3 , 1 bar , 300k)@xmath1490.0270 hole / cu1 reported by thurber _",
    "et al_.@xcite it is well known that the main effect of ca doping and of a hydrostatic pressure on the structure of sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 is a reduction of the * b * parameter.@xcite the contraction of lattice parameters induced by a pressure of 30 kbar corresponds to a substitution of three sr by three ca , _",
    "@xmath150kbar@xmath151bar@xmath152.@xcite thus , the equality between @xmath148(ca0 , 32 kbar ) and @xmath28(ca3 , 1 bar ) suggests that the transfer of holes from chains to ladders under pressure and upon ca doping is caused , at least for the ca - poor compounds , by the same reason namely , a shrinkage of the intersheet cuo@xmath8-cu@xmath8o@xmath9 distance .    the hole distribution among cu1 , o1 and o2 sites of the ladders as a function of temperature at different pressure and ca content is presented in figs .",
    "[ orbhvst](b ) and [ orbhvst](c ) .",
    "these figures show that the holes transferred from the chains to the ladders with increasing temperature sit mainly on the o1 and cu1 sites .",
    "ca substitution leads to the transfer of holes which reside on the cu1 and o2 rung sites .",
    "finally , nearly all holes transferred at room temperature into the ladders when pressure is applied occupy the o2 sites .",
    "figure [ holevst ] shows the distribution of holes located in the 2p orbitals of the oxygen rung site o2 in ca12 between the 2p , a and 2p , c orbitals .",
    "as is seen in the figure , these holes go primarily in the 2p orbitals oriented along the @xmath153-axis of the rungs at increasing ca content and pressure .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of ref . where an enhancement of the hole density in the o 2p , a orbitals in going from ca0 to ca12 was found .",
    "it has been shown in a number of theoretical studies that the spin gap value @xmath154 in the spectrum of spin excitations of two - leg ladders is very sensitive to the degree of carrier doping of the cu@xmath8o@xmath9 layer.@xcite namely , @xmath154 decreases as the hole number in the ladder plane is increased .",
    "our previous nmr studies@xcite have revealed a substantial reduction of the spin gap under pressure . since the applied pressure causes the transfer of holes from the chains to the ladders it is reasonable to explain the spin gap reduction under pressure by an increase of the hole density in the ladder layer . as mentioned above ,",
    "the ladder layers of ca12 contain a finite amount of nonlocalized holes even at low @xmath11 the number of which increasing under pressure .",
    "therefore , the growth of the residual spin susceptibility at low @xmath11 at increasing pressure observed in our previous works@xcite can be related to the increase of single mobile holes in the ladders at low @xmath11 .",
    "such a situation leads in turn to a finite density of states at the fermi level which contributes to the spin susceptibility as seen from the korringa contribution to the nmr relaxation .",
    "note that the achievement of an appropriate carrier doping level due to the @xmath75-axis shrinkage under pressure is not a sufficient condition for a stabilization of superconductivity in ca@xmath7 compounds .",
    "otherwise , even a less substituted ca@xmath7 sample should show superconductivity applying a high pressure .",
    "experimentally , sr@xmath155ca@xmath156cu@xmath5o@xmath6 did not reveal superconductivity up to 85 kbar.@xcite ca substitution has an effect on the lattice similar to high pressure although not equivalent.@xcite the lattice parameter @xmath157 in the ca@xmath7 ladders shows hardly any change under pressure but on the other hand is very sensitive to ca doping .",
    "for instance , an hydrostatic compression of a ca8 sample up to 110 kbar can not reduce the @xmath157 parameter down to its value in ca12 under 30 kbar.@xcite since a reduction of the @xmath157 parameter enhances the interladder interaction along the @xmath153-axis it leads to a more two - dimensional ladder system .",
    "we suggest that prerequisites for the stabilization of superconductivity in a spin - ladder are an adequate `` two - dimensional degree '' and a large enough carrier doping level .",
    "ca substitution is essential to achieve a two dimensional character while the necessary carrier density can only be attained by pressure .",
    "in summary , we have reported a @xmath0cu and @xmath1o nmr investigation of the nuclear quadrupole interaction tensor , @xmath2 , in the hole doped spin ladder system sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( @xmath7=0 and 12 ) at ambient pressure and under a pressure of 32 kbar when ca12 ladders are superconducting .",
    "we have related the changes in @xmath2 to a variation in the effective hole concentration of the ladder layer and have determined the hole distribution among ladder and chain systems as a function of temperature , ca content and an applied hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ orbhvst ] and [ holevst ] .",
    "the overall tendency of the temperature dependence for the hole density in the ladder layer is a reduction as temperature is lowered .",
    "the effective hole concentration in the cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ladder plane of ca0 compounds depends only weakly on the temperature below 150 k but increases steeply above 150 k. the additional hole number in ladder layers of ca12 shows a dramatic change in the temperature range @xmath79 k and a @xmath11-independent behavior outside this region .",
    "holes transferred from the chains to the ladders at increasing temperature occupy mainly the cu @xmath158 and the o 2p , c orbitals at the cu1 and o1 sites of ladders .",
    "an increase of the ca content and of the applied pressure leads to an additional doping of the cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ladder units .",
    "ca substitution leads to a transfer of holes in the orbitals of cu1 and rung oxygen o2 ions whereas under pressure nearly all transferred holes occupy the o 2p , a orbitals of o2 oxygens .",
    "a comparison between the effect of pressure and ca substitution on the hole number in the ladder layers and of the lattice parameters suggests that the hole transfer from chains to ladders under pressure and upon ca doping is caused , at least for ca poor compounds by a shrinkage of the intersheet cuo@xmath8-cu@xmath8o@xmath9 distance .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that a rather substantial number of holes in the ladder planes of ca12 is remaining delocalized down to the lowest temperature .",
    "we suggest that the important role of high pressure for realizing superconductivity in ca12 is an increase of the hole density in the ladder layers . however , the stabilization of a superconducting ground state in the spin ladder sr@xmath3ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 is achievable only at a rather high `` 2d degree '' in the ladder plane .",
    "this two - dimensionality is obtained more by ca substitution than by high pressure .",
    "finally , it is worth putting the behavior of superconducting spin ladders in the context of high @xmath159 ( htsc ) superconductors .",
    "once enough 2-d character has been achieved by ca doping , superconductivity can then be stabilized at a strongly pressure dependent critical temperature .",
    "@xmath159 amounts to 5 k in ca12 under 30 kbar@xcite and passes through a maximum at 10k in ca11.5@xcite and ca13.6@xcite under 45 and 35 kbar respectively .",
    "as suggested by the present nmr / nqr study , pressure enhances the carrier concentration in the ladder planes .",
    "the pressure ( hole concentration ) dependence of @xmath159 is also reminiscent of the parabolic dependence found for @xmath159 _ versus _ the carrier concentration in many htsc @xcite .",
