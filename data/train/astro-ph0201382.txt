    "a previously undetected population of t dwarfs , brown dwarfs exhibiting ch@xmath12 absorption bands at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath13 @xcite , have recently been identified by various deep optical and near - infrared surveys @xcite .",

    "* hereafter , 2mass 1237 + 6526 ) , identified in the two micron all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) , was found to have h@xmath0 in emission , with a relative luminosity @xmath1(l@xmath2/l@xmath3 ) = @xmath44.3 @xcite .",
    "while many low - mass stars and young brown dwarfs are seen to exhibit this feature , likely generated by chromospheric magnetic activity , the frequency and relative luminosity of h@xmath0 emission drops rapidly beyond spectral types m7 v @xcite .",
    "indeed , at the time of its detection , the emission of 2mass 1237 + 6526 was unique amongst objects later than type l5 v. @xcite have recently reported weak h@xmath0 emission in the bright t2 v sdssp j125453.90 - 012247.4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss 1254 - 0122 ) .",
    "in order to explain the activity of 2mass 1237 + 6526 , @xcite have hypothesized that this object may actually be an interacting brown dwarf binary system . in this scenario ,",
    "the binary mass ratio and orbital separation are such that the lower - mass secondary fills its roche lobe and steadily loses mass to the primary . for a 70 m@xmath8 = 1.90@xmath1410@xmath15 g = 9.55@xmath1410@xmath16 m@xmath17 , r@xmath8 = 7.15@xmath1410@xmath18 cm = 0.10 r@xmath17 @xcite . ]",

    "the close orbit required for this scenario currently rules out direct imaging of the binary pair ( @xmath24 @xmath26 0@xmath270002 assuming a distance of 14 pc ; burgasser et al .",
    "1999 ) ; however , partial eclipsing could be observed in a system with an inclination @xmath9 @xmath10 60@xmath11 .",
    "we have obtained followup spectroscopic and photometric observations of 2mass 1237 + 6526 in order to test the binary hypothesis , as well as examine the possibility that this object was originally observed during a prolonged flare . in @xmath282 , we present red optical ( 630010100  ) spectral data obtained over 1.6 yr using the keck 10 m low resolution imaging spectrograph ( * ? ? ?",

    "finally , in @xmath285 we discuss how these follow - up observations constrain various emission mechanisms for this unique object .",
    "2mass 1237 + 6526 has been observed on seven separate occasions in the red optical regime starting in 1999 july .",
    "early data , obtained on 1999 july 16 - 18 ( ut ) using lris , are described in @xcite . here",
    ", we present our latest lris observations obtained on 2000 march 5 and 2001 february 20 ( ut ) .",
    "data acquisition and reduction procedures for the first run are described below , and are similar to those used for the 2001 february data as described in @xcite .",
    "conditions during our 2000 march 5 ( ut ) observations of 2mass 1237 + 6526 were clear with 0@xmath2780@xmath279 seeing . because of its optical faintness ( r @xmath10 26 ; matthews et al .",
    "1996 , burgasser et al .",
    "1999 ) , the target was invisible on the guider camera , so acquisition into a 1@xmath29 slit was done by blind offset from a nearby optical source using positions determined from 2mass coordinates .",
    "spectral data were obtained using the 400 lines mm@xmath30 grating blazed at 8500  , covering the spectral range 6300 to 10100  at 9  resolution .",
    "the og570 order blocking filter was used to reduce second - order light .",
    "two exposures of 1800s each were obtained ; however , the data from the first exposure were fainter than expected , so the target was repositioned prior to the second exposure .",
    "observations of the dza4 white dwarf wd 1225 - 079 @xcite and the b1 v flux standard hiltner 600 @xcite were also obtained for calibration using the same instrumental configuration .",
    "science data were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "a series of one - second dark exposures were median - combined and subtracted from the science data to remove detector bias .",
    "median - combined quartz - lamp flat - field exposures ( reflected off of the interior dome ) were used to normalize the response of the detector .",
    "spectra were then extracted using the apextract routine .",
    "curvature of the dispersion line was determined from bright standard star exposures and applied to the extraction of the 2mass 1237 + 6526 spectrum .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using ne - ar arc lamp exposures taken immediately after the target observations .",
    "we then computed a telluric correction from the white dwarf spectrum by interpolating over telluric o@xmath6 ( 68506900  a - band , 76007700  b - band ) and h@xmath6o ( 71507300 , 81008350 , and 93009650  ) bands , and we applied this correction to our flux standard and 2mass 1237 + 6526 spectra .",
    "finally , flux calibration was done by correcting our hiltner 600 observations to the spectrophotometric data given by @xcite , being careful to interpolate over telluric features and the balmer h@xmath0 line .",
    "this correction was then applied to the spectrum of 2mass 1237 + 6526 .",
    "reduced spectral data from our 2000 march and 2001 february observations are shown in figure 1 .",
    "full spectra with flux plotted on a logarithmic scale are shown in the right panel , while a close up of the h@xmath0 line on a linear scale is shown on the left .",
    "a combined spectrum from our 1999 july 16 ( ut ) observations is also plotted for comparison @xcite .",
    "the 2000 march spectrum is roughly 2.6 times fainter than our 1999 july observations , likely the result of poor targeting onto the slit due to the blind offset and proper motion of 2mass 1237 + 6526 ( first observed by 2mass on 1999 march 13 ut ) .",
    "the 2001 february spectrum , on the other hand , is brighter by a factor of 1.3 ; atmospheric transparency on this night was excellent , and the target was visible on the facility guide camera , enabling proper slit placement .",
    "features present in the spectra are noted , including the strong 3(@xmath31,@xmath32 ) and 2(@xmath33@xmath34,@xmath33@xmath35)+2@xmath33@xmath6 h@xmath6o bands starting at 9250 and 9540  @xcite , a possibly weak 4(@xmath31,@xmath32 ) ch@xmath12 band centered at 8950  @xcite , and lines of cs i at 8521 and 8943  ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the dominant feature in these spectra is the strongly pressure - broadened k i resonance doublet ( @xmath37 ) , centered at 7665 and 7699  , but extending over most of the spectral regime shown . @xcite",
    "have shown that the red wing of the k i doublet is the primary contributor to the steep slope seen from 800010000  in the spectrum of sdssp j162414.37 + 002915.6 @xcite , and this feature is likely responsible for shaping the red optical spectrum of 2mass 1237 + 6526 as well .",
    "h@xmath0 emission at 6563  is clearly seen in all of the spectra of figure 1 , and its presence in our recent data suggests that emission is persistent in 2mass 1237 + 6526 over a period of at least 1.6 years .",
    "we have investigated the temporal behavior of h@xmath0 emission by measuring the line flux in all of our spectra to date .",
    "flux data were integrated within 20  of the emission peak after subtracting off the neighboring pseudo - continuum , the scatter of which was used to estimate uncertainties .",
    "corrections have also been computed to compensate for slit losses , by scaling the individual spectra to match data from 1999 july 16 ( ut ) in the 80009500  region .",
    "the initial and corrected line fluxes are listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 plots these line fluxes versus ut time .",
    "all of the corrected values are in excellent agreement with the mean line flux from our 1999 july observations , ( 7.0@xmath50.5)@xmath1410@xmath38 erg @xmath39 s@xmath30 , with the exception of data taken on 1999 july 17 ( ut ) . as reported by @xcite",
    ", these data were of extremely low signal - to - noise ( again , likely due to poor slit placement ) , and it is possible that the formal errors are too low . excepting this data point , we find that the h@xmath0 emission in 2mass 1237 + 6526 is very stable , firmly ruling out any kind of flaring event .",
    "the weighted mean value over all observations is @xmath40 = ( 7.44@xmath50.08)@xmath1410@xmath38 erg @xmath39 s@xmath30 , consistent with previous results .",
    "to gauge how the strength of h@xmath0 emission in 2mass 1237 + 6526 compares to other active , cool dwarfs , we computed the relative h@xmath0 luminosity for each spectrum , @xmath41(l@xmath42/l@xmath3 ) = @xmath41(@xmath43/@xmath44 ) , where @xmath45 in units of erg @xmath39 s@xmath30 @xcite , and @xmath46 = @xmath47 + bc@xmath48 is the apparent bolometric magnitude .",
    "using a revised j - band magnitude for 2mass 1237 + 6526 from the 2mass second incremental release catalog and bc@xmath48 = 2.09@xmath50.10 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* determined from measurements of gliese 229b ) , we derive @xmath46 = 18.12@xmath50.14 and a mean @xmath41(l@xmath42/l@xmath3 ) = @xmath44.3 , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "we compare this value to the emission ratios of late - m , l , and t dwarfs in figure 3 . using spectral data from @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we computed h@xmath0 line fluxes directly from the spectra as described above , with bolometric fluxes for late - m and l dwarfs computed from 2mass j - band photometry and bc@xmath48 values from @xcite . for t dwarfs",
    ", we used 2mass j - band photometry and bc@xmath48 = 2.09 , yielding an upper limit to the true bolometric correction for the early- and mid - t dwarfs @xcite , and hence a lower limit to the bolometric flux ; i.e. , overestimating the relative h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "detections are plotted as open symbols , while upper limits ( determined from pseudocontinuum noise levels ) are indicated by downward arrows . for comparison ,",
    "we have included m and l dwarf samples from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crosses ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* diamonds ) .",
    "the trend of decreasing activity beyond m5m7 v reported by @xcite is readily apparent in this plot , and appears to continue well into the t dwarf regime .",
    "indeed , only two objects have reliable detections beyond spectral type l5 v , the t2 v sdss 1254 - 0122 , with @xmath41(l@xmath42/l@xmath3 ) = @xmath45.7 , and 2mass 1237 + 6526 . the former object is over 25 times less luminous in h@xmath0 then 2mass 1237 + 6526 , and upper limits for the other t dwarfs do not exceed @xmath41(l@xmath42/l@xmath3 ) = @xmath45.2 .",
    "@xcite compares 2mass 1237 + 6526 to another unusually active cool dwarf , the m9.5 ve pc 0025 + 0047 @xcite , which is indicated in figure 3 by the solid square .",
    "this object , with @xmath41(l@xmath42/l@xmath3 ) = @xmath43.4 , is also more than ten times brighter in h@xmath0 than other objects in its class , although it is not extremely active in comparison to earlier emission m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "pc 0025 + 0047 also shows long - term stability in its emission @xcite .",
    "these common characteristics provide further evidence that emission processes in these two objects may be related .",
    "examination of the spectra of figure 1 also shows an apparent blueshift in the h@xmath0 line in our 2000 march data as compared to the other epochs .",
    "we measured a line center deviation of 3.2@xmath50.5  in this spectrum with respect to the 2001 february data , where the uncertainty is derived from the scatter of telluric oh emission line wavelengths between these two data sets .",
    "this deviation corresponds to a velocity of 150@xmath525 km s@xmath30 , which can not be due to differences in the earth s rotational and orbital motion between the two epochs , amounting to only 2.4 km s@xmath30 .",
    "as with our initial detection of h@xmath0 , we carefully scrutinized the reality of this subtle ( 12 pixel ) line shift . figure 4 shows the h@xmath0 region in the raw image data from 2000 march and 2001 february .",
    "telluric oh emission lines in the 6563  region appear as vertical bands , while the bright spots are h@xmath0 emission in 2mass 1237 + 6526 ; note the lack of continuum in this region .",
    "there is a slight offset in the emission between these two epochs with respect to the telluric lines , confirming the spectral results in figure 1 .",
    "however , this shift could be due to poor centering of the object on the slit .",
    "both individual exposures taken on 2000 march 5 ( ut ) show a similar offset , despite repositioning of the object .",
    "the second exposure was brighter and probably better positioned , but was still 2.6 times fainter than our 1999 july results ; hence , it too may have been misaligned . on the other hand , seeing on the nights of 2000 march 5 and 2001",
    "february 20 ( ut ) was roughly equivalent to the width of the slit employed , so significant shifting of the spectrum due to poor slit placement is less likely .",
    "we were unable to perform an independent check using the weak 8521 and 8943  cs i lines due to the low signal - to - noise of both spectra .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is some evidence for a velocity shift in the h@xmath0 line which must be confirmed with higher resolution data .    assuming its reality ,",
    "the h@xmath0 line shift ( which appears to be asymmetric toward the blue ) could arise from a single hot spot on the surface of a rapidly rotating brown dwarf .",
    "the velocity of the line is comparable to but less than the break - up speed for a substellar object , roughly 330 ( 520 ) km s@xmath30 for a 30 ( 75 ) m@xmath8 brown dwarf . in this case , however , the integration time of each individual observation made ( typically 2030 minutes ) would be a significant fraction of the rotation period ( no less than about 50 minutes ) , and one would expect the line to be broadened rather than shifted .",
    "a more reasonable source would be a hot spot in orbit around the brown dwarf , possibly arising from an optically thin accretion disk .",
    "discrete regions in an edge - on keplerian disk would have line - of - sight radial velocities as high as 150 km s@xmath30 at separations of roughly 5 ( 12 ) r@xmath8 for a 30 ( 75 ) m@xmath8 central source .",
    "the hot spot would have to be small , due to the lack of blue continuum seen in at shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the magnitude and direction of the velocity shift is similar to that seen in some solar flaring events during an impulsive evaporation phase @xcite ; however , we do not see the typically brighter redshifted condensation component @xcite .",
    "in addition to our spectroscopic data , we searched for photometric variability in 2mass 1237 + 6526 , for the purpose of detecting an eclipse by a closely - separated companion .",
    "j - band monitoring observations were obtained over two nights , 2000 may 1920 ( ut ) , using the palomar 60  ircam .",
    "conditions on both nights were generally hazy but clear , with average seeing of 1@xmath272 to 1@xmath278 ; some scattered cirrus was present during the observations of may 20 .",
    "data were acquired in sets of five 45s exposures dithered by 10@xmath29 on may 19 and 15@xmath29 on may 20 in a square pattern .",
    "a total of 155 and 165 images were obtained , spanning periods of 2.50 and 2.57 hours on may 19 and 20 , respectively ( table 2 ) .",
    "science data were initially pairwise differenced to eliminate bias and sky background , and then divided by a normalized flat - field image , constructed by differencing median - combined sets of lamp - on and lamp - off dome observations made on may 19 .",
    "bad pixels were identified in the flat - field image and corrected in the science images by interpolation .",
    "the four separate readouts of the ircam nicmos-3 hgcdte array occasionally introduced additive quadrant biases that we removed by subtracting off the median from each quadrant . finally , individual images in each set were shifted and coadded to produce a final reduced image ( figure 5 ) .",
    "for each image , we computed aperture photometry ( @xmath49 ) for 2mass 1237 + 6526 and other sources in the field .",
    "flux within a 2@xmath275 ( 4.04 pixel ) radius aperture was integrated after subtracting the mean background measured in a 6 to 12@xmath29 annulus around each object .",
    "uncertainty estimates of the photometry , @xmath50 , included contributions by shot noise in the source and variations in the background ( essentially flat field uncertainties ) .",
    "instrumental magnitudes , @xmath51 , were then computed with corresponding uncertainties , @xmath52 .",
    "the scatter in instrumental magnitudes for 2mass 1237 + 6526 was roughly 0.03 mag on may 19 and 0.01 mag on may 20 , with formal photometric uncertainties of @xmath50.025 mag .    to compute a relative magnitude light curve , we first examined sources in the field for variability , using the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "we first determined relative magnitudes and uncertainties for each source : @xmath53 @xmath54 where the reference magnitudes and uncertainties were computed as @xmath55 @xmath56 summing over the @xmath57 other sources in the field . after subtracting off the mean relative magnitude , we computed the reduced @xmath58 for each source to determine if photometric variations were significant : @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the total number of images .",
    "we constrained calibrator sources to have @xmath61 @xmath7 0.5 , corresponding to a probability of variability @xmath62",
    "@xmath63 1% for @xmath60 = 30 .",
    "two calibrators present in images from both nights passed this constraint , 2massi j1237367 + 652600 ( calibrator 1 ) and 2massi j1237372 + 652536 ( calibrator 2 ) .",
    "these sources have 2mass j magnitudes of 15.07@xmath50.05 and 15.34@xmath50.06 , respectively , and are indicated on figure 5 .",
    "relative magnitudes were then computed for 2mass 1237 + 6526 using these two calibrator stars .",
    "the resulting time series is shown for both nights in figure 6 .",
    "the mean relative magnitude has been subtracted off in both datasets .",
    "time series for the differenced calibrator magnitudes ( @xmath64 ) are also shown ( offset ) for comparison .",
    "scatter in the relative magnitudes of 2mass 1237 + 6526 was 0.020 and 0.014 mag on may 19 and 20 , respectively , less than the formal photometric uncertainties .",
    "corresponding @xmath61 values are 0.505 and 0.314 , which are greater than those of the calibrator stars ( 0.271 and 0.237 , respectively ) , but nevertheless reject variability ( at levels above our detection threshold ) at the @xmath22 99% confidence level .    to examine to possibility of a modulated signal ( e.g. , multiple eclipsing events or geometric modulation ) ,",
    "we constructed periodograms for each night s data using the formalism of @xcite and @xcite as summarized in @xcite . given the duration of the observations , we are sensitive to periods ranging from roughly 0.11.3 hr on each night .",
    "the computed periodograms ( oversampled by a factor of 10 ) for both 2mass 1237 + 6526 ( black lines ) and calibrator stars ( grey lines ) are shown in figure 7 .",
    "may 19 and 20 data are identified by solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "none of the peaks in the 2mass 1237 + 6526 periodograms are significant , as they do not exceed the 50% false alarm probability level and are roughly equal in magnitude to insignificant peaks seen in the calibrator periodograms .",
    "variability over two nights also appears to be absent .",
    "there is a 0.024 mag offset in the mean relative magnitudes between the two nights ; this is greater than the difference between the mean calibrator values ( 0.003 mag ) , but comparable to the photometric uncertainties .",
    "we compute @xmath61 = 0.593 over both nights , again rejecting variability at the @xmath22 99% confidence level . because of the large temporal gap in the time series data",
    ", periodicity analysis requires more sophisticated algorithms ( e.g. , the clean algorithm ; roberts , lhar , & dreher 1987 ) ; however , given the lack of statistical evidence for variability , further analysis appears to be unwarranted .",
    "given the null results from these statistical tests , we conclude that there is no short - term variability in 2mass 1237 + 6526 at the @xmath50.025 mag level over periods of 0.12.5 hours and no evidence of periodicity for periods of up to 1.3 hours .",
    "there also appears to be no compelling indication of variability at this level for periods of up to @xmath65 14 hours .",
    "in order to determine what constraints our null variability results impose on the interacting binary hypothesis , we have updated the basic theory described in @xcite by comparison with theoretical models from @xcite .",
    "our observables are ( 1 ) a period limit from the duration of monitoring observations , ( 2 ) a magnitude limit at which we are sensitive to variability , and ( 3 ) the properties of the primary .",
    "we therefore seek to derive a relation @xmath66j = @xmath67 , where @xmath25 and @xmath9 are the period and inclination of the system , and @xmath68 the mass of the primary . for this discussion",
    ", we normalize masses to m@xmath8 and distances to r@xmath8 , and assume a circular orbit and negligible angular momentum loss ( e.g. , to gravitational radiation or disk interaction ) . the period ( in hours )",
    "is determined from the standard keplerian relation : @xmath69 in jupiter - based units . in the case of an interacting binary ,",
    "the secondary fills its roche lobe , and hence its radius @xmath70 is determined by @xmath71 @xcite .",

    ". only values of @xmath66j@xmath92 for which @xmath98 0.63 and m@xmath6 @xmath22 5 m@xmath8 are displayed , corresponding to the limits for sustained mass loss @xcite .",
    "significant drops in the observed flux are predicted by this model , particularly for @xmath9 @xmath99 80@xmath11 , where fluxes at maximum eclipse over 0.7 mag fainter than the nominal brightness are possible over the full range of periods shown .",
    "these flux deviations are due primarily to the substantial brightness ratio between the secondary and primary , which is particularly important at high inclination angles where obscuration is most complete . at lower inclination angles ,",
    "the limiting factor is the orbital separation , which is larger for lower mass secondaries .",
    "no eclipse variations are predicted to occur for @xmath100 over the range of ages examined .",
    "note that significant systematic errors may be present for the lowest mass ratios ( i.e. , low secondary t@xmath87 ) due to the rough estimate of @xmath101 in equation  [ eq : sigma ] ; however , our observations generally sample only the highest mass ratios due to the period cutoff",
    ".    the predicted @xmath66j@xmath92 from these models are generally much larger than our observational limits ( indicated by the hatched region in figure 8) .",
    "the constraints imposed by the non - detection of variability are summarized in table 3 for @xmath9 @xmath22 60@xmath11 ; in this case , @xmath19 @xmath22 0.70 , 0.53 , and 0.37 , corresponding to secondary masses m@xmath6 @xmath22 16 , 16 , and 20 m@xmath8 for @xmath88 = 0.5 , 1.0 , and 5.0 gyr , respectively .",
    "note that for the 0.5 gyr case , our mass ratio limit exceeds the minimum @xmath19 required to sustain mass loss .",
    "the lowest inclination angle eclipses that could have been detected by our observations for @xmath88 = 1.0 and 5.0 gyr are @xmath102 = 54@xmath11 and 56@xmath11 , with corresponding minimum secondary masses of 20 and 34 m@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "based on the results of the monitoring observations , we can confidently rule out an interacting binary system for 2mass 1237 + 6526 for @xmath9 @xmath22 60@xmath11 and m@xmath6 @xmath22 20 m@xmath8 .",
    "we can not rule out a less inclined system , although such a geometry would fail to explain the apparent line shift seen in our 2000 march spectral data .",
    "a compromise solution would be a moderately inclined system with a massive primary and large mass ratio .",
    "conclusive synthesis of the spectroscopic and photometric data , however , requires verification of h@xmath0 line shift .",
    "other emission mechanisms should also be considered .",
    "2mass 1237 + 6526 could be a young , and hence very low mass , brown dwarf that is still accreting material from a circum(sub)stellar disk .",
    "if this object were in a weak - lined t - tauri ( wltt ) phase , its h@xmath0 line could arise from a small , optically thin accretion boundary layer , consistent with our spectral and photometric observations . assuming a typical wltt age ( 30100 myr ; hartmann , kenyon , & hartigan 1993 ) and t@xmath87 @xmath65 950 k , the evolutionary models of @xcite predict a mass of 312 m@xmath8 , below the deuterium - burning limit .",
    "note that 2mass 1237 + 6526 is not associated with any known star - forming region , although it could have been ejected from its nascent cluster @xcite .",
    "the absence of the 1.25 @xmath13 k i doublet in this object ( i.  mclean , priv .",
    "comm . ) marginally supports the possibility of it being a low - gravity source , although we can not rule out a purely temperature effect @xcite .",
    "our follow - up observations of 2mass 1237 + 6526 have enabled us to rule out flaring as a viable means of emission , and have placed significant constraints on the geometry and membership of an interacting binary system .",
    "parallax ( to determine absolute brightness ) and space motion measurements are clearly required to further characterize this object .",
    "furthermore , the apparent velocity shift described in @xmath282.4 , which may prove to be a vital clue to the origin of emission in 2mass 1237 + 6526 , requires confirmation and more detailed , higher - resolution investigation .",
    "the nature of this enigmatic brown dwarf may hopefully be revealed with further observations .",
