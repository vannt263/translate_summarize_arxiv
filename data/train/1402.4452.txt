    "silica ( sio@xmath1 ) is one of the most important and widely used materials in today s world .",
    "one could say that the fact of its ubiquity is as clear as window glass .",
    "because silica is an excellent insulator and can be easily created through thermal oxidation of the silicon substrate , sio@xmath1 is also the insulator of choice in the semiconductor industry .",
    "optical fibers made from pure silica are widely used by the telecommunications industry and , because silica and silicates make up over 90% of the earth s crust , sio@xmath1 plays a major role in the geosciences .",
    "liquid silica is the extreme case of a `` strong '' liquid . when cooled , its viscosity approaches the glass transition slowly , following the arrhenius law @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the so - called `` fragile '' liquids reach this glass transition far more quickly . glasses rich in silica , but modified by other oxides to lower their viscosities , are `` strong '' liquids that have slow vitrification so are preferred by glassblowers who need time to work their magic .",
    "simulations have indicated that liquid silica does not behave like a strong liquid for all temperatures , however . using the bks model @xcite ( see appendix  a ) , vollmayr _ et al . _ found that at very high temperatures the diffusion greatly deviates from the arrhenius law ( and thus behaves like a fragile liquid ) , and that the temperature - dependence of the diffusion better fits the vogel - fulcher law @xcite .",
    "it was later shown by horbach and kob @xcite that the temperature - dependence can also be fitted well by a power law of the shape @xmath3 in which the exponent @xmath4 is close to 2.1 ( compared to 1.4 for water ) and @xmath5  k. this temperature dependence is often found in simple liquids and has been described in terms of mode - coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite . a deviation from the arrhenius law has also been measured in other models of silica @xcite , and small deviations from a pure arrhenius law were found for the viscosity in experimental data @xcite .",
    "this transition from fragile to strong upon cooling ( often called the `` fragile - to - strong crossover '' ) has also been found in simulations of other tetrahedral liquids , such as bef@xmath1 @xcite , silicon @xcite , and water @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is not restricted to tetrahedral liquids , however .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that the fragile - to - strong crossover might be a behavior common to all metallic glass - forming liquids @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fragile - to - strong crossover , it has been proposed that liquid silica also has a liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) @xcite much like that proposed for liquid water @xcite .",
    "these phenomena may be related .",
    "it was recently shown that in analog plastic crystal systems many strong glass - formers are accompanied by a singularity ( a lambda - type order - disorder transition ) at high temperatures , and that in silica this singularity could be a llcp @xcite .",
    "the fragile - to - strong crossover arises simultaneously with a large increase of the isobaric heat capacity @xmath6 .",
    "if a llcp exists in silica , this heat capacity maximum should have its origin in its critical fluctuations .",
    "the discovery of a llcp in liquid silica would thus provide a unifying thermodynamic explanation for the behavior of liquid silica .",
    "we consider here two different models of silica , the bks model by van beest _",
    "_ @xcite and the wac model ( also known as the trim model for silica ) introduced by woodcock _",
    "both models represent sio@xmath1 as a simple 1:2 mixture of si ions and o ions , i.e. , without any explicit bonds .",
    "one difference between the two models is that wac uses full formal charges while in bks partial charges are used . for a detailed description of both models ,",
    "see appendix a.    all simulations are done using gromacs  4.6.1 @xcite , with @xmath7 ions , using the ewald sum ( pme ) for electrostatics , and the v - rescale thermostat @xcite to keep the temperature constant .",
    "most simulations are done in the constant - volume / constant - temperature ( @xmath8 ) ensemble .",
    "for the few constant - pressure ( @xmath9 ) simulations we use the parrinello - rahman barostat . for most of the simulations",
    "we use a time step of 1  fs , but at very low temperatures we increase the time step to 4  fs to speed up the simulations to approximately 250  ns / day .",
    "we carefully check the temperatures below which the 4  fs time step gives the same results as the 1  fs time step and do not include any 4  fs data that lead to a small difference in pressure , energy , or diffusion .    as a measure of the equilibration time",
    ", we define @xmath10 as the time at which @xmath11  nm , i.e. , the average time it requires for an o ion to move twice its diameter of 0.28  nm . most simulations run for over @xmath12 , well beyond the time necessary for the system to reach equilibrium . for the range of temperatures and pressures considered here , the root mean squared displacement of the o ion is roughly 1.11.6 times that of the si ion , this factor being the largest at low temperatures and low pressures .",
    "an important structural feature is the coordination number of si by o , since a tetrahedral network is defined by 4-coordination of the network centers .",
    "we calculate the si coordination number by the usual method , integrating the si - o radial distribution function up to the first minimum . for both models , and at all state points considered here ( below 10  gpa ) , the coordination number lies between 4.0 and 4.9 .",
    "the coordination number is the largest at high densities , and levels off to 4 when the density is decreased and the pressure reaches zero and becomes negative .",
    "the most direct method of locating a critical point is to calculate the pressure @xmath13 as a function of temperature @xmath14 along different isochores . in a @xmath15-diagram",
    "the isochores cross within the coexistence region and at the critical point . at those state points",
    "( at a given @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) the system is a combination of two different phases with different densities .",
    "one can also locate a critical point by plotting the isotherms in a @xmath16-diagram in order to determine the region in which the slope of the isotherms becomes zero ( critical point ) or negative ( coexistence region ) . because it is easier to determine whether two lines are crossing than whether a curve is flat , we study the isochores .",
    "figure  [ fig : isochores_bks_wac ] shows the @xmath15-diagrams with the isochores of bks and wac .",
    "obtain a negative curvature .",
    "if this curvature becomes more negative as @xmath14 goes down , then it is possible that the isochores will not cross below 3500  k. we conclude that for the temperatures currently accessible , the isochores alone are insufficient to demonstrate a llcp in wac .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    both diagrams are similar . there is a clear density anomaly to the left of the temperature of maximum density ( tmd ) , and if we raise the temperature by approximately 4000  k then the bks isochores match those of wac reasonably well .",
    "thus , based on the isochores in fig .",
    "[ fig : isochores_bks_wac ] , one could say that bks and wac are very similar systems , and that they mainly differ in a shift of temperature .    at very low @xmath13 and high @xmath14 the liquid phase is bound by the liquid - gas ( or liquid - vacuum )",
    "spinodal , and lowering @xmath13 below the spinodal leads to spontaneous bubble formation . at very low @xmath14",
    "the liquid becomes a glass , and the diffusion coefficient drops rapidly . because the time it takes to equilibrate the system is inversely proportional to the rate of diffusion ,",
    "simulations require too much time once the oxygen diffusion @xmath17 drops below @xmath18  @xmath19/s , which is where the isochores stop in fig .",
    "[ fig : isochores_bks_wac ] . for both models",
    "this limit is reached at a higher temperature for low @xmath13 than for high @xmath13 .",
    "this is caused by the diffusion anomaly ( an increase in @xmath13 leads to an _ increase _ in diffusion ) , which is present in both bks and wac models .",
    "no crystallization was observed , unless the pressure was raised to values far outside the range of our detailed studies ( e.g. , above 40  gpa the wac liquid spontaneously crystallizes into an 8-coordinated crystal ) .",
    "normally , crystallization is readily detected by a rapid drift of the energy to lower values .",
    "however , when the diffusivity is very low ( as in the present system , in the domain of greatest interest ) the situation is different and crystal growth can be unobservably slow .",
    "more direct tests are then needed . in the present case",
    "we have sought information on crystal growth and melting by creating a crystal front ( half simulation box of the liquid interfacing with half box of the topologically closest crystal ) and have watched the crystal front receding at high temperature .",
    "however , the attempt to determine melting point by lowering the temperature and observing reversal of the interface motion , was unsuccessful because the growth rate became unobservably small ( observed over microseconds ) before any reversal was seen .",
    "we conclude that , since this crystal front was put in by hand , the possibility of crystallization by _ spontaneous _ nucleation ( always the slowest step ) followed by crystal growth , is zero .    based on the fitting and extrapolation of data ,",
    "previous studies have predicted a liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) in both wac and bks @xcite . with the increase in computing power , and using the techniques to speed up the simulations discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] , we are able to obtain data at lower temperatures than was previously possible . our results for bks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isochores_bks_wac]a ) show that for @xmath20  k the isochores are nearly parallel , and therefore a llcp in bks is very unlikely . on the other hand , the isochores of the wac model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isochores_bks_wac]b ) show a more interesting behavior in that they clearly approach one another at low @xmath14 in the vicinity of @xmath21  gpa .",
    "if we only consider the wac isochores above 4000  k , then extrapolation would predict that the isochores cross around 3500  k and 5  gpa .",
    "however , below 4000  k we see that the isochores are starting to display a negative curvature in the @xmath15-plane .",
    "this signals an approach to a density minimum , which is the low-@xmath14 boundary of the density anomaly region .",
    "the negative curvature makes it hard to perform an extrapolation that convincingly shows that the isochores cross at lower @xmath14 .",
    "we can therefore only conclude that ( for the temperatures currently accessible ) the isochores are insufficient to prove or disprove the existence of a llcp in wac .",
    "upon approaching a critical point , the response functions should diverge .",
    "although true divergence occurs only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath22 , a large maximum should still be visible in response functions such as the isothermal compressibility @xmath23 and the isobaric heat capacity @xmath6 even when the box size is relatively small .",
    "calculations using the ising model and finite size scaling techniques applied to simulation results have shown that ( for sufficiently large boxes ) the location of the critical point is very close to where both @xmath23 and @xmath6 reach their global maximum @xcite .",
    "if a llcp truly exists in wac , then the @xmath15-diagrams of @xmath6 and @xmath23 should show a large @xmath6 maximum close to where @xmath23 has a maximum  exactly where the isochores come together and where the llcp has been predicted to be .",
    "( a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d )    figure  [ fig : response_functions_wac ] shows four response functions for wac : ( a ) the isothermal compressibility @xmath23 , ( b ) the isobaric heat capacity @xmath6 , ( c ) the isobaric thermal expansivity @xmath24 , and ( d ) the isochoric heat capacity @xmath25 .",
    "these have been obtained using @xmath8 simulations together with the smooth surface technique described in appendix  [ appendix_smooth_surface ] . to check the results generated by this technique , we determine whether the response functions satisfy the thermodynamic relation @xmath26 . because of statistical errors in the data we find slight deviations from zero , but these are less than 1  j/(mol  k ) in magnitude .",
    "the compressibility @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig : response_functions_wac]a shows a clear global maximum near @xmath21  gpa and @xmath27  k , because this is where the isochores in fig .",

    "it is quite likely that below 4000  k this maximum increases further .",
    "if wac has a llcp then @xmath6 should also have a maximum in that vicinity .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : response_functions_wac]b shows that this is not the case .",
    "there is clear global @xmath6 maximum , but it is located near @xmath28  gpa and @xmath29  k , which is far from the global @xmath23 maximum . therefore , based on the response functions , we conclude that wac does not have a llcp .",
    "the isobaric thermal expansivity @xmath24 ( fig .",

    "this should come as no surprise , since @xmath30 arises from fluctuations in entropy and @xmath31 from volume fluctuations , while the expansivity @xmath32 arises from a combination of both .",
    "even though the global maxima occur at different places , the slopes @xmath33 of the loci of local maxima are the same , so it seems likely they have a common origin . because the system is not quite critical , the enthalpy fluctuations that determine the heat capacity can be statistically independent of the density fluctuations .",

    "we choose the coefficients of the polynomial such that the new potential @xmath141 has no inflection at @xmath142 .",
