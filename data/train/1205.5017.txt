    "physics of gaseous disks around astronomical objects , also known as accretion disks , has been one of the most important topics in astrophysics since the pioneering works of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) , lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ; hereafter lbp74 ) .",
    "historically , a lot of attention has been paid to understanding the properties of disks in which the mass accretion rate @xmath1 is constant with radius . some other varieties of disks",
    "have been studied as well , in particular the so - called _ circumbinary disks _  gaseous disks orbiting a central binary , which can be a stellar binary or a pair of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in centers of galaxies .",
    "the latter type of systems has recently attracted a lot of attention since the tidal interaction of the smbh binary with the disk results in the loss of the orbital angular momentum of the former and its faster inspiral .",
    "this may help resolve the so - called `` last parsec '' problem ( yu 2002 ; lodato 2009 )  stalling of the smbh binaries at separations of @xmath4 pc caused by the inefficiency of stellar dynamical processes at shrinking their orbits .",
    "such circumbinary disks are the prime focus of this work .",
    "depending on the mass ratio of the binary components one can have different modes of tidal coupling of the binary with the disk .",
    "when the secondary - to - primary mass ratio @xmath5 is very small , the secondary can not perturb the disk significantly and migrates through it in the so - called type i migration regime familiar from the studies of protoplanetary disk - planet interaction ( ward 1997 ) . at higher mass ratios but also on the viscosity and other disk parameters ,",
    "see lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) , rafikov ( 2002 ) . ]",
    "the secondary becomes capable of clearing gas from the annulus around its orbit , switching its orbital evolution into the so - called type ii migration regime .",
    "as @xmath6 gets closer to unity the gap around the orbit of the secondary turns into a central cavity inside of which the binary resides . numerical simulations ( macfadyen & milosavljevi 2008 ; cuadra 2009 ) typically show that for @xmath7 the size of the cavity is about twice the semi - major axis of the binary orbit .",
    "deposition of the angular momentum of the density waves excited by the binary causes non - trivial evolution of the circumbinary disk .",
    "the seminal study of lbp74 followed by works of e.g. lightman & eardley ( 1974 ) , lin & papaloizou ( 1996 ) have shown that the behavior of disks evolving under the action of both the internal viscosity and the external torque can be described by a simple equation = - , [ eq : evsigma ] where @xmath8 is the external torque per unit mass of the disk . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the surface density and kinematic viscosity of the disk , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are time and radius , and @xmath13 is the specific angular momentum for circular orbit .    in this work , following lbp74 and lyubarskij & shakura ( 1987 ) we reformulate equation ( [ eq : evsigma ] ) in a more convenient form which allows a very straightforward interpretation of the steady state disk structure and provides a transparent way of understanding the evolution of circumbinary disks .",
    "this allows us to describe the structure and electromagnetic signatures of the circumbinary disks around smbh binaries , their variation in time , and the back - reaction onto the orbital evolution of the central binary , leading to its inspiral .",
    "our work is structured as follows . in ",
    "[ sect : evolution ] we provide a general description of the coupled disk - binary evolution , derive governing equations , and obtain steady state solutions that generalize previously known results . in  [ sect : smbh ] we provide the description of the properties of disks around smbh binaries parametrizing them via the viscous angular momentum flux rather than the mass accretion rate @xmath1 .",
    "this parametrization allows simple description of the properties of steady state circumbinary disks . in ",
    "[ sect : evol ] we discuss evolution of circumbinary disks , in particular deriving the self - similar solutions to an evolving disk structure .",
    "all these results are then used in  [ sect : smbhs ] to describe the coupled evolution of a smbh binary and a circumbinary disk , including the self - consistent time variation of the disk properties , the orbital inspiral of the binary components , and the electromagnetic manifestations of the system .",
    "our main results are summarized in ",
    "[ sect : summ ] .",
    "we consider a binary consisting of two point masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( total mass is @xmath16 ) , moving around common barycenter on circular orbits ( for simplicity we neglect the possibility of non - zero eccentricity ) .",
    "binary is surrounded by a proghrade , coplanar disk ( cf .",
    "nixon 2011 ) which extends to much larger distances than the binary semi - major axis @xmath17 .",
    "we assume the eccentricity of the binary to be negligible , even though simulations show the possibility of eccentricity growth due to the tidal binary - disk coupling ( roedig 2011 ) .",
    "the disk is truncated by the binary torque at the radius @xmath18 ; the width of the gas - depleted annulus between the orbit of the secondary and @xmath18 is @xmath19 for @xmath20 while @xmath21 for @xmath7 ( macfadyen & milosavljevi 2008 ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that neither the primary nor the secondary have their own disks ( this simplification can be easily relaxed ) .",
    "the detailed conditions for gap opening by a massive perturber in a disk can be found elsewhere ( lin & papaloizou 1986 , rafikov 2002 ) .",
    "here we just assume that the binary torque clears out a clean central cavity in the disk . in practice",
    "this generally sets a lower limit on the mass ratio of the binary components @xmath6 ( determined by the local conditions in the disk ) , below which the tidal torque of the secondary is too weak to prevent viscous refilling of the gap ( or cavity ) .",
    "we determine the conditions under which such an overflow of the disk across the orbit of the secondary ( kocsis 2012a , b ) is possible in  [ sect : overflow ] .",
    "external torque @xmath8 due to tides raised by the central binary is expected to be concentrated right at the edge of the gap or cavity around the orbit of the secondary .",
    "this expectation is borne out in calculations of the torque density distribution both in uniform disks , where it is generally found that @xmath22 ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; armitage & natarajan 2002 ) , and in nonuniform disks , where it has been shown by petrovich & rafikov ( 2012 ) that @xmath8 decays _ exponentially _ near the disk edge . as a result , already at small separations from @xmath18 the term proportional to @xmath8 in equation ( [ eq : evsigma ] ) can be neglected ; this equation then reduces to its classical form first obtained by lbp74 .",
    "effect of the binary torque is then incorporated in the solution of this simplified equation via the boundary condition ( discussed in  [ sect : bcs ] ) imposed at the inner edge of the disk .    throughout this work",
    "we will assume the potential in which the disk orbits to be faithfully represented by a newtonian potential produced by a combined mass @xmath23 .",
    "evolution of an accretion disk is best illustrated if we characterize the disk at each radius not by its surface density @xmath9 but by the viscous angular momentum flux @xmath24 defined as -2r^3=3r^2 , [ eq : fnu ] where the last equality is for keplerian disks with @xmath25 .",
    "this quantity represents the viscous torque exerted by the part of the disk interior to a given radius @xmath12 on the external part of the disk , and is thus equal to the amount of angular momentum crossing the disk circumference @xmath26 per unit time due to the action of viscosity .    in the absence of external torques mass accretion rate through the disk",
    "can be directly expressed ( lbp74 ) through the divergence of the viscous angular momentum flux as ( note that we take @xmath27 for mass inflow towards the center of the system ) m(r)=()^-1 = , [ eq : mdot ] motivating us to change the independent variable from @xmath12 to @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the evolution equation ( [ eq : evsigma ] ) with @xmath29 takes on a particularly simple form ( lbp74 ; filipov 1984 ; lyubarskij & shakura 1987 ) : ( ) = , [ eq : evf ] where the function similar to the diffusion coefficient d_j - r^2 [ eq : d_j ] is in general a function of both @xmath28 and @xmath24 because of the possible dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath24 .    despite the mathematical simplicity of the evolution equation ( [ eq : evf ] ) , which was first recognized by lbp74 , over the years it has become conventional to study disk evolution using the more complicated equation ( [ eq : evsigma ] ) .",
    "we show next that use of equation ( [ eq : evf ] ) allows certain advantages over the standard approach , in particular for obtaining the steady state solutions for the disk structure .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : evsigma ] ) and continuity equation one finds -m=-()^-1 + 4 .",
    "[ eq : dotm_gen ] as we mentioned before , @xmath8 is expected to be significant only in a narrow annulus at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "we may then assume for simplicity that @xmath29 outside of some radius @xmath30 , which is not too different from @xmath18 ( to be specific , one can e.g. take @xmath30 to be the radius interior to which the binary exerts @xmath31 of its torque on the disk ) . multiplying equation ( [ eq : dotm_gen ] ) by @xmath32 and integrating between @xmath17 and @xmath30 one gets ( r_)=2_r_b^r _ rdr+ _ r_b^r _ mr dr , [ eq : intmdot ] where we set @xmath33 because @xmath34 by our assumption of a clean gap .    the first integral on the right hand side of this expression is the total torque that the binary exerts on the disk .",
    "as long as the orbital evolution of the binary is driven predominantly by the tidal coupling to the disk ( and not due to the gravitational wave emission ) conservation of the angular momentum ensures that this term is equal to -=-v_b , [ eq : v_b ] where @xmath35 is the orbital angular momentum of the binary and @xmath36 is its inspiral speed .    in the second integral in equation ( [ eq : intmdot ] )",
    "one can write @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radial velocity of the gas , and approximate @xmath39 in the annulus between @xmath17 and @xmath30 , thus assuming that gas in this annulus closely follows the shrinkage of the binary orbit",
    ". then one can easily see that as long as the mass of the secondary @xmath40 satisfies the condition m_s_r_b^r _ r^2 dr , [ eq : m_s_limit ] the second term in the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : intmdot ] ) is smaller than the first one .",
    "this condition is often replaced by demanding that the `` local disk mass '' @xmath41 in the vicinity of the binary ( i.e. at @xmath42 ) be less than the mass of the secondary ( sc95 , hereafter sc95 ; haiman 2009 ) .    whenever we are in the limit ( [ eq : m_s_limit ] ) the viscous angular momentum flux in the inner region of the disk can be directly related to the orbital evolution of the binary : ( r_in)=- .",
    "[ eq : cond ] here we replaced @xmath30 with @xmath18 since the two radii are very similar ( and also very close to @xmath17 ) . on the contrary , if the condition ( [ eq : m_s_limit ] ) is not fulfilled the inner part of the disk absorbs most of the angular momentum brought in by viscous torques and equation ( [ eq : cond ] ) becomes invalid . in this case a more general boundary condition in the form ( [ eq : intmdot ] ) must be employed .",
    "using definition ( [ eq : fnu ] ) and expression for @xmath43 one can rewrite equation ( [ eq : cond ] ) as a formula for the orbital evolution time of the binary @xmath44 : t_ev== , [ eq : t_ev ] where we defined the viscous timescale @xmath45 , evaluated at @xmath17 .",
    "similar expressions ( up to a constant factor ) have previously been quoted in the literature on type ii migration in the limit of @xmath46 , see e.g. lodato ( 2009 ) , baruteau & masset ( 2012 ) . a subtle point in this expression",
    "is that both @xmath47 and @xmath48 vary in time as the disk evolves even if the orbit of the secondary does not change appreciably .",
    "calculation of this evolution is one of the goals of our present work .",
    "previously sc95 have used equation ( [ eq : cond ] ) coupled with the condition @xmath49 as @xmath50 as a boundary condition for the problem of the circumbinary disk evolution .",
    "they have also assumed that a steady state solution for the disk structure can always be obtained even far from the binary , despite the fact that the radius @xmath17 ( at which the inner boundary condition is imposed ) evolves as the secondary migrates . because of this inconsistency their solution explicitly depends on time via the dependence on @xmath51 ( and the torque on the binary is found to depend on the mass of the secondary ) and should evolve on the migration timescale of the secondary .",
    "however , the latter is much shorter than the viscous timescale of the disk far from the binary , where this solution is still assumed to be valid ( by construction , the migration timescale of the secondary is of order the viscous timescale at @xmath52 ) . as a result ,",
    "viscous transport in the disk is unable to communicate information about the changing inner boundary condition outside the immediate vicinity of the inner edge of the disk , implying internal inconsistency of the quasi - steady solution derived in sc95 .",
    "this issue has been first noted by ivanov ( 1999 ; hereafter ipp ) ; nevertheless the sc95 solution is still being used in studies of the disk - assisted smbh binary evolution ( haiman 2009 ; kocsis 2011 ; yunes 2011 ) .    in our work",
    "we take a different approach and specify the inner boundary condition in the form of the constraint on the mass accretion rate @xmath1 .",
    "previously , ipp have used boundary conditions similar to ours , even though they have formulated them via the asymptotic behavior of the disk surface density @xmath9 .",
    "for that reason many of our results coincide with their findings .    at large separations",
    "we normally take the disk to be a standard constant @xmath1 disk with the mass supply rate @xmath53 .",
    "but close to the binary , as @xmath50 , @xmath1 does not in general have to be equal to @xmath53 . if the tidal interaction with the binary presents a strong barrier for the gas inflow , then @xmath54 is vanishingly small ( liu & shapiro 2010 ) .",
    "but in general tidal torques do not have to completely stop the mass inflow : in some situations ( e.g. if the gap cleared out by the secondary is not deep / broad enough to present a serious obstacle to the gas inflow ) a fraction of mass arriving at the inner edge of the disk can cross the orbit of the secondary and be accreted by one of the binary components ( kocsis 2012a , b ) .",
    "alternatively , gas can be removed from the circumbinary disk in the form of a wind , see  [ sect : f_j ] , [ sect : edd_lim ] . to account for this possibility we generally use an inner boundary condition in the form |_r = r_in = m(r_in)= m _ , [ eq : inner_bc0 ] see equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) . here",
    "@xmath55 is assumed to be constant , allowing @xmath56 to be less than @xmath53 . in practice the value of @xmath54 and @xmath57",
    "is set by the strength of the tidal barrier ( liu & shapiro 2010 ) and may vary in time as the system evolves .    clearly , @xmath58 implies no gas inflow across the orbit of the secondary , and this is the situation that we will often consider in this work . for @xmath59 secondary does not present any barrier to the mass inflow and the disk structure reduces to that of a disk with constant @xmath60 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : evf ] ) clearly admits a simple steady state solution ( lbp74 ) ( l)=f_j,0+f_j,1 l , [ eq : fsol ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants , and @xmath28 is the specific angular momentum .",
    "this solution is completely independent of the detailed physics that determines the disk properties , since for any ( even highly nonlinear ) dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath24 and @xmath28 the solution ( [ eq : fsol ] ) still satisfies equation ( [ eq : evf ] ) in steady state .    according to equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) this solution implies @xmath64 also being constant , which seems to suggest that equation ( [ eq : fsol ] ) corresponds to the conventional accretion disk with constant @xmath1 .",
    "this however is not true is general .",
    "first description of a constant @xmath1 accretion disk was provided in a seminal work of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , who explored properties of disks affected only by the internal viscous stresses all the way to the central object .",
    "they have shown in particular that in such disks the local surface density @xmath65 at each radius is related to the mass accretion rate via m=3 , [ eq : mdot_ss ] while the energy loss per unit surface area of the disk scales as t_eff^4(r)=m^2 .",
    "[ eq : t_ss ]    over the years the concept of constant @xmath1 disks has evolved to essentially imply disk properties given by equations ( [ eq : mdot_ss ] ) and ( [ eq : t_ss ] ) . in the rest of this work",
    "we will call such disks _ standard constant @xmath1 _ disks .",
    "let us now consider a steady state solution in the form ( [ eq : fsol ] ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "combining equations ( [ eq : fnu ] ) and ( [ eq : fsol ] ) one finds m=3-f_j,0 l^-1 , [ eq : mdot_gen ] which reduces to ( [ eq : mdot_ss ] ) only when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and results in a quite different expression for @xmath1 otherwise . in particular",
    ", it follows directly from ( [ eq : mdot ] ) that it is possible to have a steady disk with @xmath70 as long as @xmath24 is independent of radius . in such constant @xmath24 disk surface density",
    "is related to @xmath24 via = f_j,0=3(r)l , [ eq : dotm0 ] which replaces equation ( [ eq : mdot_ss ] ) .",
    "we explore properties of such disks in  [ sect : properties ] .",
    "similarly , the viscous energy dissipation rate in the disk per unit radius ( and per unit time ) @xmath71 is given by = -= .",
    "[ eq : nrg ] since @xmath72 we can write t_eff^4(r)= , [ eq : t_gen ] which in steady state described by the solution ( [ eq : fsol ] ) yields t_eff^4(r)=. [ eq : t_steady ] again , this expression reduces to the conventional result ( [ eq : t_ss ] ) only when @xmath68 . in the case of @xmath70 disk with @xmath73 one",
    "finds t_eff(r)= ( ) ^1/4 r^-7/8 , [ eq : tscale ] so that @xmath74 increases towards small radii more steeply than in a standard constant @xmath1 disk ( for which @xmath75 ) .",
    "this result was first obtained by sc95 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : t_gen ] ) predicts non - zero @xmath76 for a disk with @xmath77 , even though @xmath70 in such a disk .",
    "since there is no inward mass flow in this disk and corresponding release of potential energy is absent one may naturally wonder where does the energy emitted from the disk surface come from . integrating equation ( [ eq : nrg ] ) between arbitrarily chosen inner and outer radii @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "one finds the global energy release between these radii e(r_i < r < r_o ) = , [ eq : dotenu ] where we have used the fact that @xmath0 is independent of @xmath12 . thus , the global rate of energy generation by viscous dissipation is equal to the work done on the disk by the viscous stress at its inner and outer edges .",
    "the latter ultimately provides the energy source for the radiation from the disk surface .    to summarize , the assumption of a steady state does not necessarily require @xmath1 and @xmath76 in a disk to be given by standard equations ( [ eq : mdot_ss ] ) and ( [ eq : t_ss ] )  these equations are sufficient but not necessary characteristics of steady disks .",
    "the most general steady state is in fact described by equation ( [ eq : fsol ] ) and then it follows that @xmath1 and @xmath76 must be given by equations ( [ eq : mdot_gen ] ) and ( [ eq : t_steady ] ) . in the rest of the paper",
    "we explore the properties of such `` non - standard '' disks .",
    "it is conventional to describe the structure of steady state accretion disks using the mass accretion rate @xmath1 , assumed to be constant with radius , as a free parameter ( e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "such calculations universally assume that relations ( [ eq : mdot_ss ] ) and ( [ eq : t_ss ] ) hold true , i.e. that @xmath68 in equation ( [ eq : fsol ] ) .",
    "having shown in  [ sect : steady ] that in general steady state does not require @xmath68 we now revise these scalings by expressing disk properties in terms of @xmath24 , which may in general be a function of both time and radius @xmath12 or specific angular momentum @xmath28 , rather than @xmath1 . when an additional assumption @xmath77 is made these relations naturally describe the properties of @xmath70 disks , see  [ sect : steady ] .",
    "in our calculations we will always make an assumption of an optically thick disk , but it is easy to extend them to optically thin disks as well . because of the large range of radii spanned by disks in some systems , the conditions in them are expected to vary with radius , resulting in transitions in the opacity behavior . to account for this in appendix [ sect : gen_opacity ]",
    "we derive a set of scaling relations applicable to the gas pressure dominated disks with power law opacity behavior , and apply them in  [ sect : smbh ] to disks around smbh binaries .",
    "structure of the inner region of a circumbinary disk around a smbh binary may be strongly affected by the radiation pressure .",
    "we parametrize its role by a dimensionless ratio of the gas pressure to total pressure @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the gas pressure and @xmath82 is the radiation pressure . in the radiation pressure dominated case @xmath83 , while in the gas pressure dominated case @xmath84 .",
    "behavior of viscosity in the radiation pressure dominated fluid is not well understood at the moment .",
    "there is still an ongoing debate whether it is determined by the full pressure or just the gas pressure in the disk .",
    "for that reason we use a prescription motivated by the conventional @xmath85-parametrization of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) and accounting for the two possibilities in a convenient form ( goodman 2003 ) : = ^b .",
    "[ eq : nu ] here @xmath86 corresponds to kinematic viscosity proportional to the full pressure @xmath87 , while @xmath88 corresponds to the case when only the gas pressure @xmath89 determines the viscosity .",
    "lightman & eardley ( 1974 ) suggested that radiation pressure dominated disks with @xmath86 are thermally unstable but recent numerical work by hirose ( 2009a , b ) does not show this to be the case .",
    "disks around smbh binaries are heated by internal viscous dissipation and also by energy deposition of the density waves launched by the central binary .",
    "for simplicity we do not consider here the latter contribution ( its role has been studied by lodato 2009 ) and assume that disk heating is described by equations ( [ eq : nrg ] ) and ( [ eq : t_gen ] ) .",

    "it might seem surprising that the torque experienced by the binary is independent of the mass of the secondary  @xmath198 is set only by @xmath53 and @xmath199 , since it is the potential of the secondary that gives rise to the tidal coupling with the disk .",

    "we emphasize that the torque acting on the binary , which according to equation ( [ eq : cond ] ) is equal to @xmath214 , is independent of the mass of the secondary @xmath40 and is the same irrespective of the mass ratio of the binary @xmath6 ( see also ipp ) .",
    "also , the dependence of @xmath214 on the total mass of the binary @xmath23 arises only because @xmath23 determines the angular frequency in the disk . at first sight",
    "this may seem strange since the strength of tidal interaction is determined by the potential of the secondary .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the full torque exerted by the binary on the disk is generally found to scale as ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; papaloizou & lin 1984 ; petrovich & rafikov 2012 ) ( r_in ) , [ eq : scaling ] irrespective of the precise form of the torque density distribution . here",

    "both @xmath214 and @xmath215 are set globally at the radius of influence .",
    "equation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) shows that a particular value of the binary torque @xmath214 can be obtained not only by changing @xmath40 but also by varying the width of the gap @xmath217 for a given @xmath40 , and this is how the disk - binary tidal interaction self - regulates itself to provide a necessary torque on the disk . as @xmath214 varies in time for a fixed @xmath40 the width of the gap should also vary .",
    "the same is true if one varies the mass of the secondary while keeping @xmath214 constant  the width of the gap would simply scale as @xmath218 . of course , @xmath6 can not be arbitrarily small since a low mass secondary may not be able to prevent the mass flow across its orbit ( e.g. if @xmath217 needed to provide a given value of @xmath214 turns out being smaller than the disk scaleheight ) , meaning that the gap does not exist in the first place ( see  [ sect : overflow ] ) . but as long as the gap opening conditions are satisfied for a given @xmath6 , the width of the gap should always be able to adjust itself to provide just the right amount of torque on the disk .    in our subsequent calculations we will not be directly addressing the `` final pc '' problem ( lodato 2009 ) as we typically follow smbh binaries starting at rather small separations , @xmath219 .",
    "such binaries may be created by previous ( possibly multiple ) episodes of gas infall into the center of the galaxy in which the binary resides , each of which would tighten its orbit . at the same time some of our findings ( e.g. significant reduction of the binary inspiral timescale when the disk evolution is self - consistently included ) are likely to be relevant for attempting to resolve the `` final pc '' problem by accounting for the possibility of a circumbinary disk surrounding the binary .    in all our calculations",
    "we take the viscosity to scale with the total rather than the gas pressure in the radiation pressure dominated regime , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "we will also assume that the tidal torque of the binary presents sufficiently strong barrier to inflowing gas to completely suppress gas overflow across the orbit of the secondary .",

    "we are mainly concerned with the disk - related effects on the binary evolution and for that reason we neglect the increase of the binary+disk system mass throughout the calculation .",

    "in addition to the evolution of the binary orbit ( thin solid curve ) this figure also shows the time behavior of the torque @xmath234 at the inner edge of the disk ( thick solid curve calibrated on the right axis ) , which is absorbed by the binary and causes its orbital evolution .",

    "our calculations fully take into account the nonlocality of the disk influence on the disk .    to better illustrate the role of mass puleup and disk evolution for the orbital evolution of the binary we compare our results with calculations in which disk properties remain well represented by the properties of a constant @xmath1 disk at all times .",

    "clearly , this torque can be much smaller than the real @xmath250 , especially at late times , meaning that such calculations should overestimate the inspiral time of the binary .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we display @xmath51 calculated using constant @xmath1 disk properties ( dotted curves ) and fully accounting for the binary - driven disk evolution ( solid curves ) for two equal mass ( @xmath222 ) smbh binary+disk systems : one with @xmath150 m@xmath141 , @xmath251 and another with @xmath140 m@xmath141 , @xmath252 .",
    "two different starting radii @xmath232 are explored in both cases .",

    "@xmath252 , and @xmath253 pc the evolutionary tracks of the binary computed by two methods coincide .",
    "this is because in this case gw emission is more important for the evolution of the binary than the tidal coupling to the disk at all times , resulting in a universal behavior of @xmath51 .",
    "but whenever disk torques are important , binaries shrink faster when the self - consistent disk evolution is properly taken into account .",
    "for that reason , we strongly discourage the use of standard constant @xmath1 disk properties for exploring the evolution of the central binary of a circumbinary disk .",
    "+      in figures [ fig : binary_evolve ] & [ fig : time_evolve ] we provide a more detailed and systematic view of the smbh binary evolution under different conditions .",
    "we explore two representative values of @xmath23 : @xmath254 m@xmath141 ( implying schwarzschild radius @xmath255 pc ) and @xmath256 m@xmath141 ( @xmath257 pc ) , but our results can be trivially extended to other values of @xmath23 . accretion rate in the disk at large distances is taken to be either @xmath258 or @xmath259 , and binary mass ratio is varied between @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "we also consider two different values of the starting semi - major axis of the binary @xmath232 : @xmath262 pc and @xmath223 pc for @xmath150 m@xmath141 , and @xmath223 pc and @xmath263 pc for @xmath140 m@xmath141 .",

    "one has to keep in mind though that later the torque on the binary is going to be set at the radius of influence that expands beyond @xmath232 , see  [ sect : inspiral ] .",

    "we generally agree with the results of existing studies ( e.g. ipp , haiman 2009 ) that disks can appreciably accelerate orbital evolution of smbh binaries . figures [ fig : binary_evolve ] & [ fig : time_evolve ] clearly illustrate this point . according to equation ( [ eq : t_gw ] ) without the disk the orbital evolution timescale due to emission of gravitational waves is rather long for some of the systems shown in these plots : for example , @xmath276 yr for equal mass @xmath256 m@xmath141 smbh binary starting at @xmath272 pc .",
    "systems with small mass ratios evolve even slower : a binary with @xmath260 takes @xmath277 times longer to merge due to the gw emission alone .",
    "the only system in our sample strongly affected by the gw emission from the very start is the equal mass @xmath256 m@xmath141 binary starting at @xmath223 pc and surrounded by a disk with @xmath278 , see figure [ fig : time_evolve]a .",
    "as expected this system merges faster than its @xmath260 counterpart , even though the latter is affected more by the disk torques .    on the other hand , the same @xmath222 , @xmath256 m@xmath141 binary starting at @xmath272 pc and surrounded a disk accreting at @xmath251 merges within @xmath279 myr",
    " more than 4 orders of magnitude faster than without the disk !",
    "lower mass disks are of course less efficient at driving orbital evolution of smbh binaries  the same binary surrounded by a disk with @xmath252 merges within @xmath280 yr , but this is still much shorter than the corresponding @xmath133 .",
    "lower mass ratio binaries are affected by the disk even stronger , provided that they present an efficient barrier to the mass inflow at the orbit of the secondary .",
    "for example , @xmath256 m@xmath141 binary with @xmath260 surrounded by a disk with @xmath252 , merges within @xmath281 yr , about an order of magnitude faster than the @xmath222 binary with the same parameters .    in figure",
    "[ fig : binary_evolve ] black square dots mark the location on the evolutionary track of each smbh binary where the disk dominated evolution switches to the gw dominated orbital decay . in systems with massive , high-@xmath53 disks",
    "this transition typically occurs when the binary is in contact with the radiation pressure dominated part of the disk .",
    "however , in systems with less massive , lower-@xmath53 disks this transition may happen even while the binary is surrounded by the gas pressure dominated ( with @xmath109 ) part of the disk .    another way to state",
    "the importance of the disk dominated evolution is to note that in most cases transition to gw dominated regime occurs at @xmath282 , i.e. after the binary semi - major axis has been significantly reduced by the disk torques .",
    "for example , evolution of a @xmath150 m@xmath141 binary with @xmath260 starting at @xmath223 pc is dominated by torques produced by a @xmath251 disk down to @xmath283 pc , see figure [ fig : binary_evolve]c .",
    "this is almost three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath232 and is about 200 @xmath284 for the binary .",
    "this additionally emphasizes the important role of disk torques in shrinking the smbh binary orbits , even at relatively large separations .      as described in ",
    "[ sect : inspiral ] the torque exerted on the binary is set by the disk properties at @xmath190 . initially binary can affect only its immediate surroundings as it takes certain time for the disk to absorb enough angular momentum injected by the binary to affect the surface density distribution further out in the disk .",
    "for that reason initially @xmath285 is essentially the same as in the case of a constant @xmath60 disk , and is set by the disk _ locally _ , at @xmath42 .",
    "this torque is usually rather small implying slow orbital evolution and long values of @xmath286 .",
    "however , after system has evolved for time comparable to the viscous timescale at the inner disk edge @xmath287 , @xmath190 starts exceeding @xmath17 .",
    "past that point the torque on the binary @xmath285 is being set _ globally _ , at distances far exceeding @xmath17 , which can be clearly seen in several evolutionary tracks shown in figure [ fig : binary_evolve ] .",
    "increase of @xmath285 initially occurs at almost constant @xmath17 , which is reflected in almost vertical initial evolutionary tracks in @xmath288 plane shown in figure [ fig : time_evolve]a , b , clearly visible for @xmath150 m@xmath141 and low @xmath289 .",
    "global nature of the torques is generally more pronounced for lower mass binaries and for lower @xmath53 .",
    "this is because higher @xmath23 implies earlier transition to the gw - dominated orbital decay ( see figure [ fig : time_evolve]a , b ) , shortening the binary lifetime and not allowing @xmath190 to extend as far as in the lower @xmath23 case .",
    "higher @xmath290 plays similar role , shortening the binary lifetime and reducing the radius of influence at the end of inspiral compared to the lower @xmath53 case .",
    "this is true even though @xmath190 itself depends on both @xmath23 and @xmath53  these dependencies are usually rather weak , see appendix [ sect : d_j ] .",
    "almost all tracks shown in figure [ fig : binary_evolve ] at some point in their evolution run into the situation described in ",
    "[ sect : inspiral ] , where the inner edge of the disk ( assumed equal to @xmath17 ) and @xmath190 reside in parts of the disk corresponding to different physical regimes .",
    "this means that calculations of the binary evolution assuming the scaling of @xmath209 to always correspond to the physical state of the disk near the binary orbit ( haiman 2009 ; kocsis 2011 ) are not accurate .",
    "figure [ fig : binary_evolve ] demonstrates that using this simple - minded procedure for a binary in the radiation pressure - dominated regime can easily underestimate the torque @xmath214 driving its orbital evolution thus overestimating the binary lifetime ( see e.g. figure [ fig : binary_evolve]a , c ) .",
    "analogously , for a binary residing in the gas pressure dominated regime with @xmath109 and @xmath190 extending into the part of the disk where @xmath119 ( see figure [ fig : binary_evolve]b - d ) the use of @xmath209 scaling corresponding to the binary location would again lead to a ( mild ) underestimate of @xmath214 ( @xmath291 when @xmath119 ) and an overestimate of the merger time .",
    "another consequence of the non - locality of the disk - binary coupling is the clear _ hysteresis _ in the evolution of the system  the dependence of the current rate of orbital decay of the binary on the previous history of the disk evolution .",
    "this property is most readily seen in figure [ fig : time_evolve ] , in which the evolutionary tracks computed for the same @xmath23 , @xmath6 , @xmath53 but starting at different initial radii do not result in the same orbital decay timescale @xmath286 at a given orbital period in the disk - dominated regime .",
    "one can see that for a fixed @xmath274 the inspiral timescales computed for different starting conditions can differ by a factor of several .",
    "this is in contrast to local calculations presented in haiman ( 2009 ) , in which orbital evolution depends only on the current value of @xmath17 , see their figures 1 - 5 showing just a single evolutionary track for a given set of @xmath23 and @xmath6 .",
    "because the radius @xmath190 setting the value of the inner torque @xmath214 in our calculations ( see equation [ [ eq : piece ] ] ) steadily grows , we necessarily find the disk evolution to result in the _ speed up _ of the binary decay compared to the case in which the disk is a constant @xmath60 disk at all times . as we have shown in ",
    "[ sect : inspiral ] this results in shorter lifetime of the system in our calculations , which is a very natural result .",
    "interestingly , previously haiman ( 2009 ) have reached a directly opposite conclusion  that the disk evolution caused by the mass pile up near the orbit of the secondary _ slows down _ its inspiral ( see their figures 6 & 7 ) .",
    "whether this difference is caused by the local character of the of the disk - binary coupling assumed by haiman ( 2009 ) or by the adoption of sc95 solution in their calculations is not clear .      in figure",
    "[ fig : time_evolve]c , d we display the ratio of the secondary mass @xmath40 to the local disk mass @xmath292 .",
    "our calculations explicitly assume a `` secondary - dominated '' limit @xmath293 ( sc95 ; ipp ; haiman 2009 ) since only in this case the boundary condition in the form ( [ eq : cond ] ) is valid , as discussed in ",

    "the secondary - dominated regime is close to being marginally violated , and its track exhibits noticeable evolution even prior to crossing @xmath209 curve . whenever @xmath296 the inner part of the disk contains the amount of angular momentum comparable to the full orbital angular momentum of the binary at the very start of evolution .",
    "thus , to cause appreciable evolution of the disk via tidal coupling ( which happens on the local viscous timescale ) and to push the radius of influence beyond @xmath232 requires the binary to give off a noticeable fraction of its orbital angular momentum . as a result",
    "a massive disk is able to shrink the binary orbit very efficiently , in less than the local viscous timescale at the inner edge of the disk .    at even higher values of @xmath297",
    "one needs to employ a boundary condition ( [ eq : intmdot ] ) different from ( [ eq : cond ] ) to properly compute the disk evolution .      as we discussed in ",
    "[ sect : f_j ] the magnitude of the angular momentum flux in a constant @xmath24 disk can not be arbitrarily high , because of the existence of the eddington limit ( [ eq : fj_edd ] ) in the radiation pressure dominated region of the disk .",

    "the eddington limit starts affecting the disk near the binary as soon as the latter enters the gw - dominated regime .",
    "our assumption of @xmath201 adopted throughout most of this work is equivalent to demanding the width of the gap between the orbit of the secondary and the inner edge of the disk @xmath217 to be larger than the disk scaleheight @xmath301 .",
    "indeed , the torque density produced by the planet drops for @xmath302 due to the phenomenon of the `` torque cutoff '' ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) , which implies that the secondary can effectively repel the disk fluid only if the gap width satisfies @xmath303 .",
    "when this condition is not fulfilled , gas enters the torque cutoff zone near the orbit of the secondary where the tidal repulsion is no longer effective and starts to overflow the orbit of the secondary ( kocsis 2012 ) . as a result",
    ", the inner boundary condition in the form @xmath304 may get violated .",
    "following sc95 we can estimate the gap width as ~^1/3 , [ eq : delta_h ] where we assumed viscosity to be given by equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) . in both the gas pressure and the radiation pressure dominated regime with @xmath86 ( which we adopt in our calculations )",
    "one obtains the same value of @xmath217 as in sc95 .",
    "however , in the radiation pressure dominated regime with @xmath88 ( as adopted e.g. by kocsis 2012a , b ) the gap is wider by a factor of @xmath305 , making overflow less likely .",
    "liu & shapiro ( 2010 ) calculated mass accretion rate across the orbit of the secondary using a local steady state model for the disk structure . they found that @xmath54 is exponentially small when the factor . ] in square brackets in equation ( [ eq : delta_h ] ) is large ( @xmath306 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when this factor is @xmath307 the mass accretion rate across the orbit of the secondary is found to be close to @xmath53 .",
    "this provides justification for our use of the boundary condition @xmath201 ( @xmath58 ) whenever @xmath308 , and for assuming overflow to occur for @xmath309 .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : delta_h ] ) allows us to find the value of @xmath12 at which @xmath310 , which we call the `` overflow '' radius @xmath311 .",
    "assuming that when the overflow begins the disk around the binary is in the radiation pressure dominated regime ( this is always the case in our calculations , see figure [ fig : binary_evolve ] ) with @xmath86 and @xmath118 is given by equation ( [ eq : h_rad_es ] ) , we find that @xmath310 at r_ofr_edd ( ) ^2/15 , [ eq : r_of ] where @xmath298 is given by equation ( [ eq : edd_radius ] ) .",
    "it is clear from this expression that for equal mass binaries overflow occurs only _ after _ the eddington limit becomes important since then @xmath312 . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as @xmath313 one finds @xmath314 but the actual value of @xmath311 never deviates too much ( i.e. not by orders of magnitude ) from @xmath298 because of the weak dependence of @xmath311 on @xmath6 and @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath268 and @xmath260 one finds @xmath315 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : binary_evolve ] we show the position of @xmath311 for each evolutionary track with open pentagons .",
    "these tags always lie close to the dot - dashed curve showing the eddington limit ( [ eq : edd_radius ] ) . another important observation that can be made by inspecting this figure",
    "is that at least for @xmath316 overflow always occurs close to the start of the gw - dominated phase of the orbital evolution of the binary .",
    "indeed , only for @xmath260 and only in massive disks with @xmath251 do we find that overflow _ precedes _",
    "( by only a factor of @xmath317 in terms of @xmath17 ) the stage of the gw - driven evolution , see figure [ fig : binary_evolve]a , c . both for @xmath7 and for @xmath318 ( essentially irrespective of @xmath6 ) overflow",
    "occurs when the orbital evolution of the binary is already fully determined by the gw emission .",
    "kocsis ( 2012 ) have derived quasi - steady solutions for the disk structure in presence of the overflow , reminiscent of the sc95 results . for these solutions to become valid",
    "after the overflow begins , information on the new boundary condition at the inner edge of the disk must propagate to the current radius of influence @xmath190 where the unperturbed , standard constant @xmath1 disk starts .",
    "otherwise the solution would not converge to a standard constant @xmath60 solution at large radii and @xmath1 at the inner edge of the disk can not be assumed equal to @xmath53 .",
    "establishing connection to the outer disk takes of order the viscous time at @xmath190 , which is about the age of the system in our calculations . using figures [ fig : binary_evolve ] and [ fig : time_evolve ]",
    "one can easily see that unless @xmath319 and @xmath251 the orbit of the binary evolves on a much shorter timescale than the viscous time at @xmath190 .",
    "for example , a disk with @xmath251 around a binary with @xmath140 m@xmath141 , @xmath260 starting at @xmath320 pc begins to overflow when its period is @xmath321 yr ( see figure [ fig : binary_evolve]a ) and the orbital evolution time scale is @xmath322 yr ( figure [ fig : time_evolve]a ) .",
    "this is almost the same as the viscous time at @xmath190 for the corresponding evolutionary track .",
    "thus , a quasi - steady solution can be marginally valid in this case .",
    "but if we now look at @xmath222 binary keeping everything else the same we find overflow to occur at @xmath323 yr . at this period @xmath324 yr which is much shorter than the viscous time at @xmath190 ( @xmath325 yr ) . as a result , a global quasi - steady solution does not get established in this case .",
    "similar situation occurs for @xmath326 ( and arbitrary @xmath6 ) .    to summarize , the overflow across the orbit of the secondary is most important for low @xmath6 , high @xmath53 systems .",
    "even then it does not strongly affect the orbital evolution of the binary during the disk - driven stage and becomes truly important only when the binary inspiral is dominated by the gw emission .",
    "these conclusions are reached in a setup most favorable for the emergence of the overflow  radiation pressure dominated disk with @xmath10 proportional to the radiation pressure @xmath327 .",
    "if instead @xmath10 scales with gas pressure the overflow is going to be even less important for the gas - assisted smbh binary evolution .",
    "our results have interesting implications for future space - based gravitational wave antennae such as lisa .",
    "if we adopt @xmath328 mhz ( @xmath329 yr@xmath101 ) as a characteristic lowest frequency probed by such experiments then according to figure [ fig : time_evolve]a , b equal mass binaries with @xmath330 m@xmath141 are detectable only when their orbital decay is already fully dominated by the gw emission , even for massive disks with @xmath251 .",
    "however , lower mass ratio systems including the so - called extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) can enter the detection band of the gw experiments during the stage when their orbital evolution is still dominated by the tidal coupling to the disk .",
    "an example of this can be seen in figure [ fig : time_evolve]b where the smbh binaries with @xmath260 are pushed by the disk with @xmath251 all the way until the transition to the gw - dominated regime occurs at @xmath331 yr .",
    "decay of systems with even lower @xmath6 or @xmath23 can be dominated by their disks down to even shorter orbital periods , making detection of disk - driven migration quite plausible for low @xmath23 emris ( provided that the strain they produce is above the signal - to - noise of the gw antenna ) .",
    "disk effects on the gw signal manifest themselves via the orbital phase shift of the binary caused by the variation of its semi - major axis due to the disk - driven migration , see kocsis ( 2011 ) , yunes ( 2011 ) .",
    "even if signatures of the disk - driven migration are indeed found in the gw signal of coalescing binaries , it is unlikely that one would be able to use these measurements to probe the properties of the radiation pressure dominated part of the disk in the immediate vicinity of the binary .",
    "the reason for that again lies in the nonlocal nature of the torque acting on the binary : close to @xmath332 yr evolution of all low-@xmath23 binaries shown in figure [ fig : binary_evolve]c , d is typically dominated by torques set at @xmath190 located in the _ gas pressure dominated _ regime .",
    "thus , gw phase signal will contain information only about the properties of the gas pressure dominated part of the disk , and will not inform us on the physics of the inner , radiation pressure dominated regions .",
    "we also note in this regard that the calculations of gw shifts presented in kocsis ( 2011 ) & yunes ( 2011 ) should be revised to account for this non - locality of the disk torques on the binary .",
    "disks around smbhs exhibit a set of observational signatures which distinguish them from the regular constant @xmath1 accretion disks .",
    "we illustrate this difference in figure [ fig : spec_evolve ] by showing the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a circumbinary disk at different stages of the disk+binary evolution .",
    "this particular calculation assumes an equal mass , @xmath150 m@xmath141 binary starting at @xmath333 pc , surrounded by a disk accreting gas at large separations at the rate @xmath252 ; see figure [ fig : binary_evolve]d for an evolutionary track of this system .",
    "one type of spectra shown by thick curves in figure [ fig : spec_evolve ] assumes radial distribution of the angular momentum flux in the disk @xmath334 to be given by equation ( [ eq : piece ] ) with @xmath209 taken from the self - consistent calculations presented in figure [ fig : binary_evolve]d .",
    "another set of seds ( thin curves ) is computed for the same moments of time ( and for the same values of @xmath51 ) for a standard constant @xmath60 disk extending down to the binary orbit @xmath51 . in this case @xmath335 through the entire disk .",
    "both kinds of calculations assume an outer edge of the disk to lie at @xmath336 pc ( in this calculation we disregard complications arising at large separations , which are mentioned in  [ sect : global_properties ] ; the choice of the outer radius is not important to us ) .",
    "we now go over the details of these calculations .",
    "after @xmath337 yr of evolution the binary semi - major axis has essentially not changed and the radius of its tidal influence has extended only out to @xmath338 pc . since",
    "this value of @xmath190 is close to @xmath17 , binary torques affect only the very innermost part of the disk and the spectra computed in two ways ( thick and thin long - dashed curves in figure [ fig : spec_evolve ] ) do not show significant difference . at @xmath339 @xmath108",
    "m both are well fit by a power law @xmath340 typical for a constant @xmath1 disk .    at @xmath341",
    "yr @xmath17 is still very close to @xmath232 , but the effects of the binary torque have been viscously transmitted through the disk out to @xmath342 pc .",
    "this results in a factor of @xmath343 difference in the torque acting on the binary in two cases , and noticeably changes the spectrum of the disk in a self - consistent calculation : the peak wavelength of the spectrum shifts to a slightly shorter wavelength and the peak amplitude of @xmath344 increases by a factor of 2 compared to @xmath337 yr .",
    "note that the latter is a consequence only of the change in the disk structure due to binary torques  the inner disk radius stays essentially the same in these two epochs .",
    "for the same reason there is not difference in the spectra computed assuming constant @xmath1 disk ( the thin curves for @xmath337 and @xmath345 essentially overlap in figure [ fig : spec_evolve ] ) .    at @xmath346",
    "yr @xmath17 has shrunk to @xmath347 pc , while @xmath348 pc . prior to this moment of time",
    "the disk in the immediate vicinity of the binary was in a gas pressure dominated state with free - free opacity , and the radius of influence was also in the same regime . at @xmath346",
    "yr binary starts entering the gas pressure dominated part of the disk with @xmath109 , see figure [ fig : binary_evolve]d .",
    "while the spectrum of a constant @xmath1 disk is almost the same at this epoch , the sed of a self - consistently evolved disk ( thick dotted curve ) exhibits not only an increase in amplitude and a shift towards shorter wavelengths , but also a change in slope at @xmath339 @xmath108 m : in this range @xmath344 is clearly steeper than @xmath349 .",
    "all that is again predominantly due to the evolution of the radial structure of the disk under the action of the binary torque .",
    "finally , at @xmath350 yr binary orbit shrinks to @xmath351 pc , while @xmath352 pc .",
    "note that at this separation orbital evolution of the binary is dominated by the gw emission rather than the disk torques , see figure [ fig : binary_evolve]d .",
    "however , the binary still causes the disk to evolve as long as its torque prevents the mass inflow into the inner cavity .",
    "reduction of @xmath17 leads to a change of a constant @xmath1 disk sed  its peak is now around @xmath261 @xmath108 m ( thin solid line ) and the peak of @xmath344 is about an order of magnitude higher than before . but",
    "the variation of the spectrum of a self - consistently evolved disk ( thick solid line ) is far more dramatic  it now peaks in the optical at @xmath266 @xmath108 m and the peak value of @xmath344 is @xmath353 times higher than for a constant @xmath1 disk . between @xmath261 @xmath108 m and @xmath354 @xmath108 m",
    "the shape of the sed is well fit by @xmath3 , as expected for a constant @xmath24 disk ( sc95 ) , now occupying the inner third of the radial extent of the disk and accounting for most of its luminosity .",
    "to summarize , the sed of a disk affected by the torque of a central binary is steeper , brighter , and extends to shorter wavelengths than the sed of its constant @xmath1 counterpart having the same inner radius and mass accretion rate @xmath53 at large distances .",
    "these features ( especially the steepness of the spectrum ) in principle make it possible to predict the existence of a compact central binary in a disk based on the broadband spectroscopy alone , even in the absence of other indications of a smbh binary such as the double - peaked line profiles caused by the relative motion of the binary components",
    ". this method may be the only way of inferring the presence of a binary in systems with face - on orientation .",
    "relative brightness of disks affected by the binary torque should facilitate the detection of such systems out to large distances .",
    "so far our calculations of the smbh binary evolution and electromagnetic signatures have explicitly assumed that the binary torques completely prevent mass inflow from the circumbinary disk across the orbit of the secondary .",
    "this allowed us to use the boundary condition @xmath201 in all our calculations , resulting in constant @xmath0 disk near the binary .",
    "if the zero inflow requirement is relaxed and @xmath355 then one can still construct both the steady state and the evolving self - similar solutions as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sect : steady ] & [ sect : self ] . based on these solutions",
    "one can easily extend our results for the orbital evolution of the smbh binary presented in ",
    "[ sect : inspiral ] & [ sect : inspiral_pars ] to the case of non - zero mass inflow at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk .",
    "here we only show how the sed of the disk evolves as one varies the transparency of the inner barrier presented to the gas inflow by the binary torques . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec_compare ] we show disk spectra computed assuming different values of @xmath356 . instead of equation ( [ eq : piece ] )",
    "we now approximate the spatial distribution of @xmath24 by the following simple formula : f_j(r)= \\ {    c m_l(r ) ,  r > r_infl , + m _ ,  rr_infl ,    .",
    "[ eq : piece1 ] where @xmath357 , @xmath358 .",
    "this prescription consists of two steady state solutions continuously matched at @xmath246 but with different @xmath1 inside and outside of this point . for @xmath58",
    "this formula naturally reduces to equation ( [ eq : piece ] ) .",
    "our calculations assume a system for which a spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : spec_evolve ] at @xmath359 yr for @xmath201 , i.e. an equal mass , @xmath150 m@xmath141 smbh binary at @xmath360 pc surrounded by a disk with @xmath252 , and @xmath352 pc .",
    "we show the spectrum of only the _ circumbinary _ disk , i.e. in this calculation we do not account for the emission produced by an accretion disk(s ) around the primary and/or secondary which should form when mass flows across the orbit of the secondary .",
    "one can see that as the transparency of the tidal barrier @xmath57 increases towards unity the disk spectrum steadily approaches that of a constant @xmath60 disk .",
    "this is not at all surprising because in the limit @xmath361 disk structure reduces to that of a constant @xmath1 disk , see figure [ fig : self - similar ] . as a result",
    "the slope of the power law portion of the spectrum steadily goes down from @xmath362 to @xmath363 as @xmath57 is varied from @xmath160 to @xmath261 .",
    "it is also clear from figure [ fig : spec_compare ] that sed is strongly affected compared to the case of a constant @xmath1 ( @xmath59 ) disk even if only a small amount of inflowing mass gets accumulated at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "for example , peak amplitude of the disk spectrum for @xmath364 ( implying that only @xmath365 of the accreting mass gets stopped by the binary torques ) is a factor of @xmath226 higher than in the @xmath59 case . and",
    "if the tidal barrier allows penetration of only @xmath366 of the gas across the gap , the sed of the circumbinary disk is hardly distinguishable from that of a @xmath58 disk with no gas inflow at @xmath18 .",
    "these results imply that the broadband sed of the disk is a rather sensitive measure of even a small amount of matter penetrating into the cavity cleared by the smbh binary .",
    "coupled with the measurements of the sed of the accretion disk(s ) , which may form around each of the binary components if @xmath221 , these observations can inform us on the efficiency of the binary torques at clearing a clean cavity at the center of the system .",
    "in this work we explored the coupled evolution of a smbh binary and a gaseous disk around it .",
    "disk properties ( surface density , temperature , etc . )",
    "evolve under the action of binary torques , which constrain the flow in the inner part of the disk . to study this problem",
    "we have re - formulated evolution equations in terms of the angular momentum flux @xmath24 .",
    "this significantly simplifies treatment of the steady state disk structure , when @xmath24 is a simple linear function of the specific angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "we derived the disk properties as a function of @xmath24 in different physical regimes that may be realized in circumbinary disks around smbh binaries .",
    "we demonstrated that radiation pressure can limit the value of @xmath24 in disks around massive smbh binaries by making the disk geometrically thick and susceptible to launching a radiation - driven wind .",
    "when the external mass supply to the disk at large distances is not matched at the inner edge of the disk because of the binary torques , the disk evolves towards establishing a quasi - steady state in the inner region , where the local viscous timescale is shorter than the evolution time of the system .",
    "viscous angular momentum flux in the inner disk steadily grows in time , which accelerates orbital evolution of the binary .",
    "we explored the dependence of this general picture on the system parameters ( mass of the binary , mass accretion rate through the disk , etc . ) and found the following in agreement with previous studies .    1",
    ".   tidal coupling to a circumbinary disk can substantially ( by orders of magnitude ) shorten the lifetime of the binary ( ipp ; lodato 2009 ; haiman 2009 ) .",
    "2 .   for a long period",
    "before the gw emission takes over , the binary evolves in the limit when the mass of the secondary is much larger than the local disk mass ( haiman 2009 ) .",
    "disk - driven evolution of the binary can be measurable by the space based gravitational wave antennae for low @xmath6 systems with relatively low @xmath23 ( kocsis etal 2011 ; yunes 2011 ) .",
    "spectrum of the disk affected by the binary torques is different from that of a conventional constant @xmath1 disk : it extends to shorter wavelengths and more power is emitted . instead of @xmath340 the sed of a circumbinary",
    "disk exhibits a power law segment with @xmath3 ( sc95 ) .",
    "we also obtain a number of new results , summarized below .    1",
    ".   self - consistent evolution of the disk resulting in a pile - up of mass at its inner edge accelerates the orbital evolution of the binary .",
    "2 .   disk - binary coupling has a non - local character : the torque acting on the binary is determined by the state of the disk far from the binary , at the radius of influence @xmath190 , which steadily increases in time , rather than by the disk properties in the immediate vicinity of the binary .",
    "evolution of the binary orbits exhibits a phenomenon of hysteresis  dependence of the evolution on the past history of the system , which is caused by the non - locality of the disk - binary coupling .",
    "radiation pressure can strongly affect the disk structure even in cases when the mass accretion rate at large distances ( in the constant @xmath1 portion of the disk ) is considerably sub - eddington .",
    "gas overflow across the orbit of the secondary affects binary mainly ( or only ) during the gw - dominated phase of its orbital evolution and is most important for low @xmath6 , high @xmath53 systems .",
    "spectra of circumbinary disks strongly depend on the ability of accreting gas to cross the orbit of the secondary or otherwise leave the system , thus giving rise to a non - zero value of @xmath1 at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "this list clearly implies that properly accounting for the fully self - consistent , time - dependent evolution of circumbinary disks is crucial for understanding gas - assisted smbh mergers .",
    "this general conclusion will hopefully inspire re - evaluation of some of the existing results for the orbital evolution of smbh binaries and their observational manifestations , both in the electromagnetic and the gw domains .",
