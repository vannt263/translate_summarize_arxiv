    "thermoelectric effects in bulk conductors usually necessitate breaking of particle - hole symmetry . in mesoscopic structures",
    "this asymmetry may be fairly high and can be also controlled experimentally , leading to the possibility of realizing a relatively large thermopower coefficient . as a result",
    "there is currently much interest in investigations of thermoelectric phenomena in nanoscale devices at low temperatures .",
    "experimental studies have been carried out on point - contacts , @xcite quantum dots , @xcite nanotubes , @xcite silicon nanowires , @xcite and more .",
    "very recently , the paramount importance of another symmetry breaking has been pointed out .",
    "it has been proposed that the thermal efficiency ( defined at steady state as the ratio of the output power to the heat current ) can be significantly enhanced once _ time - reversal symmetry is broken and the thermopower coefficient becomes asymmetrical _ ( as a function of , e.g. , a magnetic field ) . @xcite    early theoretical studies of thermoelectric transport coefficients of microstructures were based on the landauer approach @xcite and were mainly focused on charge and heat currents between two electronic terminals , without coupling to phonons .",
    "later on , effects of electron - electron processes and electronic correlations ( increasingly important at lower temperatures ) , as well as that of an applied magnetic field , on the thermopower produced in large @xcite and single - level @xcite quantum dots , and also in quantum wires @xcite were considered .",
    "the signature of attractive electronic interactions on the thermopower was considered in ref .  , and",
    "the dependence of the thermoelectric response on the length of the atomic chain connecting the leads has been recently computed within a density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite    the coupling of the charge carriers to vibrational modes of the molecule should play a significant role in thermoelectric transport through molecular bridges , even more so in the nonlinear regime .",
    "@xcite indeed , a density - functional computation of the nonlinear differential conductance of gold wires attributed changes in the i - v characteristics to phonon heating , @xcite and the thermopower coefficient was proposed as a tool to monitor the excitation spectrum of a molecule forming the junction between two leads . @xcite it was suggested that the seebeck effect in such bridges can be used for converting heat into electric energy @xcite , and to determine the location of the fermi level of the transport electrons relative to the molecular levels , and also the sign of the dominant charge carriers , either for a molecular conductor , @xcite or for an atomic chain .",
    "@xcite this was confirmed experimentally : the seebeck coefficient , as measured by stm on the benzenedithiol family sandwiched between two gold electrodes , showed that the charge carriers are holes passing through the homo , whose location with respect to the metal fermi level was determined from the magnitude of the coefficient .",
    "@xcite    theoretically , when the coupling to the vibrational modes is ignored , the transport coefficients have the same functional form as in bulk conductors , with the energy - dependent transmission coefficient and its derivative replacing the conductivity . @xcite although the corrections to the thermoelectric transport due to the coupling to the vibrational modes is often small , their study is of interest because of fundamental questions related to the symmetries of the conventional transport coefficients , and since they give rise to additional coefficients connecting the heat transport in - between the electrons and the vibrational modes . in a recent article @xcite ( referred to below as i )",
    "we have analyzed the thermoelectric phenomena in a molecular bridge , and studied effects induced by the coupling of the charge carriers with molecular vibrational modes .",
    "in particular we have considered the situation in which the molecule is strongly coupled to a heat bath of its own and thus may be kept at a temperature different from those of the source and sink of the charge carriers , making the junction a mixed thermal / electronic three - terminal one .",
    "namely , we have assumed that the relaxation time due to the coupling of the molecule to its own heat bath , @xmath0 , is short on the scale of the coupling of the molecule to the charge carriers .",
    "the latter is determined by the electron - vibration coupling , @xmath1 ( and the conductance electrons density of states ) which is the small parameter of our theory .",
    "hence , @xmath2 may still be very small on all other physical scales , such as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the frequency of the vibrations , or the molecular ( electronic ) level width .",
    "the phonon bath may be realized by an electronically insulating substrate or a piece of such material touching the junction , each held at a temperature @xmath5 .",
    "similar experimental three - terminal setups , consisting of quantum dots , were discussed in refs .  ,  , and  .",
    "the effect of thermal probes on the electronic heat conduction have been considered theoretically for tunnel normal - superconducting junctions @xcite and for mesoscopic conductors .",
    "@xcite    in this mixed thermal / electronic junction , heat supplied by the phonon baths [ to which the electrons and the molecule are ( separately ) coupled ] can be exchanged between the transport electrons and the vibrational modes .",
    "even more intriguing , heat carried from the phonon bath to the vibrations can be converted into a charge current ( or an electronic heat current ) flowing between the electronic reservoirs .",
    "we have found in i that in order for this conversion to take place , one needs to break the _ spatial _ symmetry of a molecular bridge , in addition to the broken electron - hole symmetry . here",
    "we examine the outcome of breaking another symmetry , that of _ time - reversal_. to this end , we exploit the aharonov - bohm effect , placing the molecular bridge on one arm of a ring threaded by a magnetic flux , @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "[ sys ] . as we show , for a non - zero flux the above conversion can also appear in a spatially symmetric bridge , provided that the effective couplings to the leads are energy dependent .",
    "the specific quantities we study are the heat and the charge currents in a small mesoscopic ( or nanometric ) system , depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ sys ] : a molecule ( having one electronic level ) is placed on an aharonov - bohm ring , which is attached to two electronic reservoirs ( held in general at different temperatures , @xmath7 , and at different chemical potentials , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the vibrational modes of the molecule , with which the charge carriers may exchange energy , are thermalized by a third terminal , kept at the temperature @xmath5 .     and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "an electron residing on the level interacts with its vibrational modes . the population of these modes can be determined by a coupling to a phonon source kept at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the ring is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath6 , measured in units of the flux quantum .",
    ", width=264 ]    since the calculations are rather technical , we organize the paper as follows . after a short analysis of the entropy production in our system ( sec . [ secii ] ) , we summarize the main results and in particular discuss the magnetic - flux dependence of the transport coefficients .",
    "we then proceed in sec .",
    "[ curs ] to specify our model , and to derive the explicit expressions for the currents .",
    "section [ lrrn ] details the various transport coefficients of the three - terminal junction in the linear - response regime .",
    "in particular , we examine the various symmetries of the coefficients , and verify that they obey the onsager relations .",
    "section [ disc ] is devoted to a discussion of our results ; we consider the transport coefficients in certain simple cases , in particular their dependence on the spatial and electron - hole symmetries of the junction .",
    "the consideration of the entropy production in the linear - response regime , carried out in i , is quite illuminating . using the thermodynamic identity @xmath11 ,",
    "@xcite one finds that the entropy production at the left ( right ) electronic reservoir is @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the energy current emerging from the left ( right ) reservoir , while @xmath14 is the corresponding particle current . adding to eqs .",
    "( [ sdl ] ) the entropy production of the vibrational modes , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the energy current from the phonon bath into the molecule , yields the total dissipation of the system , @xmath17 we demonstrate below that our three - terminal junction conserves charge , i.e. , @xmath18 , and also energy , i.e. @xmath19 . in the linear - response regime",
    "all three temperatures ( see fig . [ sys ] ) are only slightly different from each other , @xmath20 and the chemical potentials differ by a small amount , @xmath21 one then finds @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the net charge current flowing from the left electronic reservoir to the right one , @xmath24 while @xmath25 is the net heat current carried by the electrons , @xmath26 we keep the notation @xmath27 for the the energy / heat current from the phonon bath .",
    "thus , the entropy production of our three - terminal system is a simple example of the general expressions for linear transport , consistent with the onsager theory .",
    "@xcite    the calculations in the next two sections yield the relations among the driving fields and the currents . in the linear response limit one has @xmath28 = { \\cal m } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c}\\delta\\mu / e\\\\   \\delta t / t \\\\",

    "the off - diagonal entries of @xmath29 consist each of a term even in the flux , and another one , odd in it , obeying altogether @xmath31 .",
    "the flux dependence of the transport coefficients is very interesting .",
    "we find ( see secs .",
    "[ curs ] and [ lrrn ] for details ) that there are three types of flux dependencies hiding in those six coefficients .",
    "first , there is the one caused by interference .",
    "the interference processes modify the self energy of the green functions pertaining to the aharonov - bohm ring , in particular the broadening of the electronic resonance level due to the coupling with the leads .",
    "the interference leads to terms involving @xmath32 .",
    "secondly , there is the flux dependence which appears in the form of @xmath33 ( or alternatively , @xmath34 ) .",
    "this reflects the contributions of time - reversed paths .",
    "these two dependencies are even in the flux .",
    "they yield the full flux dependence of the diagonal entries of the matrix @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , and the even ( in the flux ) parts of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "finally , there is the _",
    "odd _ dependence in the flux , that appears as @xmath35 .",
    "this dependence characterizes the odd parts of the off - diagonal entries of @xmath36 .",
    "these terms _ necessitate _ the coupling of the electrons to the vibrational modes .",
    "in this section we present our model system , give details of the currents calculation , and verify their balance .      in our analysis ,",
    "the molecular bridge is replaced by a single localized electronic level , representing the lowest available orbital of the molecule ; when a transport electron resides on the level , it interacts ( linearly ) with einstein vibrations .",
    "our analysis does not include electronic interactions , but focuses on the electron - phonon ones .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the molecular bridge , which includes the coupling with the vibrations , reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy of the localized level , @xmath39 is the frequency of the harmonic oscillator representing the vibrations , and @xmath1 is its coupling to the transport electrons .",
