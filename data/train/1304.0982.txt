    "transition metal oxide ( tmo ) perovskites are known to be strongly correlated materials @xcite , whose properties are controlled by a complex interplay between geometric and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "these are determined by considering the relative magnitude between various energy scales and interactions : the energy difference of the transition metal ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 orbitals and the oxygen @xmath10 states , referred to as the charge transfer energy , and the strength of the on - site hubbard @xmath11 interaction of the @xmath9 electrons .",
    "the charge transfer energy is more important in tmo where low - energy excitations are of @xmath12-type , whereas the coulombic interaction , which localizes the electrons on the @xmath8-site , produces the insulating state in mott - hubbard systems @xcite .",
    "the properties of correlated electrons of tmo are controlled in part by the relative occupancy of the different transition - metal @xmath9 orbitals@xcite .",
    "the relative @xmath9 orbital occupancy is largely determined by the crystal field experienced by the transition - metal cation ; this electrostatic field is the result of the 2@xmath10 electronic density of the coordinating oxygen ligands .",
    "the latter , in turn , is directed by the _ extended _ geometric arrangement of the nearest neighboring oxygen atoms .",
    "orbital occupancy can be tuned , for example , through chemical substitution @xcite , epitaxial strain @xcite , or by superlattice formation in thin films @xcite .",
    "isovalent substitutions are important to charge transfer - type oxides , because rather than modifying the @xmath8-site electronic configuration , cations with different ionic sizes but the same formal valence renormalize the transfer interaction and the one - electron bandwidths through changes in the crystal structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , interatomic bond angles and distances .",
    "the crucial distortion in @xmath0o@xmath1 perovskites is the buckling of the @xmath2o@xmath2 bond angles , because the effective @xmath9 electron transfer interaction between the neighboring transition metal sites is mediated by the _ angular overlap _ with the o 2@xmath10 states @xcite .",
    "when the @xmath2o@xmath2 bond angle deviates from the ideal value of 180@xmath3 , the transfer interaction weakens and the bandwidth narrows .",
    "such distortions to the inter - octahedral bond angles are typical in gdfeo@xmath1-type perovskites , and therefore knowing how to control the _ amplitude _ of the bond angles distortions is critical to tailoring the charge transfer and @xmath9-orbital polarization . while it is well - established that greater octahedral rotations produce more buckled bond angles and narrower bandwidth @xcite ,",
    "it is not well - understood how the rotation `` sense ''  be it in - phase or out - of - phase along a specific cartesian direction  influences the differential charge occupancy on the @xmath2-site @xmath9 and o @xmath6 orbitals .    in this work ,",
    "we use density functional calculations to show that controlling the subtle flavor of the octahedral rotation sense is as important as the overall amplitude of the rotations when engineering the electronic structure , _ vis -  - vis _ orbital polarization , of charge transfer oxides near electronic mit .",
    "we explain this behavior using the definition of _ orbital polarization _",
    "@xmath13 of @xmath14 orbital relative to @xmath15 orbital , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the occupancies of @xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals , with orbital quantum number @xmath21 and magnetic quantum number @xmath22 , respectively @xcite . with this definition",
    ", orbital polarization becomes an effective measure of the charge excess in the former orbital with respect to the latter .",
    "the metric then enables us to isolate the contribution of each rotation sense to the orbital polarization by judicious choice of structural distortions and subsequent calculation of @xmath13 .",
    "we demonstrate this utility for the specific case of the fe @xmath5 ( @xmath23-symmetry ) and o @xmath6 orbitals in cafeo@xmath1 .",
    "specifically , we show that out - of - phase octahedral rotations drive a transfer of electronic charge to the apical @xmath6 orbitals along the fe  o chains collinear with the axes of rotation , whereas the fe @xmath23 state are less sensitive .",
    "we then use tensile epitaxial strain as a practical handle to enhance the orbital polarization using the @xmath13-contribution from the out - of - phase octahedral rotations to tune the ligand charge density  a crucial parameter involved in oxide - based mit materials .",
    "our results indicate that electronic - structure engineering requires both the amplitude and sense of the octahedral rotations be considered on equal footing when designing perovskite tmo for integration into next - generation electronics @xcite .",
    "to explore the rotation ",
    "orbital polarization interactions , we make use of the prototypical charge transfer oxide ( cfo ) , because it lacks jahn - teller distortions @xcite and exhibits a sequence of structural phase transitions concomitant with a first - order mit near room temperature ( rt ) @xcite . upon cooling below 290 k ,",
    "the metallic paramagnet becomes semiconducting ( space group @xmath24 ) @xcite , whereby the appearance of an octahedral breathing distortion ( bd ) together with the octahedral rotations , acts to open the electronic gap@xcite , as it has also been observed in rare - earth nickelates @xcite .",

    "this rotation pattern consists of in - phase rotations about the @xmath29-axis ( @xmath35 ) and is accompanied by two out - of - phase rotations , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , of the same magnitude about the @xmath27- and @xmath28-axes , respectively . for a perovskite with a bravais lattice that has orthogonal interaxial angles and the @xmath32 pattern , the two important fe  o  fe bond angles are @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( ) . when only in - phase @xmath35 or out - of - phase @xmath38 rotation patterns are present , the @xmath30 fe  o  fe angle measured within two subsequent fe  o layers orthogonal to the @xmath29-direction is the same . the phase , _",
    "i.e. _ , the `` rotation sense , '' does not change the rotation magnitude across the layers .",
    "navely , one would deduce that the electronic structure , and in turn the orbital polarizations , is insensitive to the sense of the rotations , since both rotations induce the same rotation magnitude about the @xmath29-axis  we investigate this supposition explicitly .    to evaluate how the rotation sense alters the electronic distribution ,",
    "we carry out density functional calculations using the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) formalism @xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite within the revised perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation for densely packed solids @xcite plus hubbard @xmath11 method @xcite ( pbesol@xmath4 ) based on the electronic and atomic structural analysis reported in our previous study @xcite .",

    "we impose fm order on all fe - sites then fully relax the spin density .",
    "we use a plane wave energy cutoff of 600 ev , which is then increased up to 850 ev for calculations of the electronic densities of states ( dos ) .",

    "an energy gap appears at the fermi level ( @xmath44 ) in the spin - down channel .",

    "the bd mode is responsible for splitting of the @xmath48 fe site in the undistorted structure ( @xmath45 ) into two wyckoff positions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , each centered in smaller and larger octahedra arranged as in a 3d checkerboard ( ) . both the in - phase @xmath35 and the out - of phase @xmath38 rotations split the @xmath5 oxygen site symmetries in the parent phase into two distinct sets ;",
    "the consequence of these distortions is that the fe @xmath9-orbitals experience an electrostatic interaction from the oxygen ligands which no longer has the complete octahedral cubic symmetry .",
    "coupling the bd with in - phase or out - of - phase rotations , results in structures with @xmath46 or @xmath47 tetragonal symmetry , respectively . this symmetry lowering changes the dos with respect to the cubic phase mainly in energy windows far from @xmath44 : the spin - down bandwidth decreases , enhancing the band gap , and the spin - up states shift to higher energies in the conduction band ( near 1 ev ) .",
    "comparison of the dos for the different rotation flavors [ ( b ) and ( c ) ] , however , shows no appreciable differences near @xmath44 ; the low energy bands appear insensitive to the rotation sense .",
    "we now track the change in the orbital polarization , @xmath13 , as we increase the breathing distortion together with the rotation amplitude of the oxygen displacement patterns associated with either the @xmath35 or @xmath38 rotations [ ( a ) and ( b ) ] about the @xmath29-direction .",
    "to compute @xmath13 , occupancies are calculated by integrating the angular momentum resolved dos for particular @xmath52 , obtained by projecting the kohn - sham wave functions onto the spherical harmonics , starting from the lower edge of the anti - bonding valence band states up to @xmath44 .",

    "we first analyze the orbital polarization of the apical [ ( a - d ) ] and equatorial oxygen atoms in ( see ) for all possible 2@xmath10 orbital pairs with increasing amplitude of rotation and bd under a fixed volume constraint : @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "examined , we find the @xmath63 and @xmath64 polarization is positive with @xmath66 and @xmath67 preferentially occupied over the orbital directed along @xmath29 ( @xmath68 ) . both polarizations are @xmath70 and the width of variation is @xmath71 . these axial polarizations diminish for both rotation flavors if the bd increases .",
    "we understand this behavior as follows : the @xmath68 orbital pointing along fe  o bond axis increases its electron occupancy owing to a charge transfer from the equatorial plane , containing @xmath66 and @xmath67 orbitals , towards the fe  o  fe bond axis [ ( c ) ] .",
    "the orbital polarization involving @xmath68 is nearly constant with respect to increasing _ in - phase _ rotation and turns out to have a minimum at large _ out - of - phase _ angles and large breathing distortion values . at fixed bd amplitude , large out - of - phase angles direct the charge transfer towards the fe  o bond along the ( rotation ) @xmath29-axis . for the _ equatorial _ oxygen atoms , @xmath62 is also small ( @xmath69 ) , indicating the orbitals are equally populated ( data not shown ) . @xmath63 and @xmath64",

    "both polarizations are minimal for small rotation angle values ( further from cubic symmetry ) , yet the differential occupation appears to be weakly dependent on the rotation sense .",

    "if the bd is absent , rotations alone do not induce a metal - insulator transition @xcite . at fixed bd ,",
    "however , there are some dependencies of the electronic band gap on the rotation sense .",
    "] moreover , the iron sites are largely sensitive to the breathing distortion , whereby the more expanded an octahedron becomes , the greater is the charge transfer to the apical bond axes .",
    "this effect increases the orbital polarization of the corresponding fe cations ; it can also be more readily achieved with the @xmath38 rather than the @xmath35 rotation pattern .",
    "these results suggest that sense of the octahedral rotation mainly affects the oxygen atoms lying along the rotation axis that `` screen '' the metal cations , which are unable to `` see '' the rotation sense effects .      in the experimental cafeo@xmath1 structure , the bd is present together with the @xmath32 rotation pattern , where both rotation senses are present and out - of - phase rotations",

    "tensile bi - axial strain promotes the @xmath32 rotation pattern in @xmath76-oriented orthorhombic perovskites thin films @xcite . to explore the effect of strain on rotation - induced @xmath13 ,",
    "we compute the equilibrium structure of cafeo@xmath1 under biaxial tensile strain , relaxing ionic positions and the @xmath76-axis length .",
    "first , we evaluate the effect of strain on the atomic structure .",
    "we find that @xmath31 deviates more from 180@xmath3 with increasing tensile strain [ ( a ) ] .",
    "consistent with our previous observation , when the bd and @xmath73 rotations are active , the orbital polarization is enhanced along the fe  o equatorial bonds with greater tensile strain .",
    "importantly , we note that within the insulating phase as strain is increased , the bd largely remains constant while the octahedral rotations are enhanced to accommodate the strain energy [ ( a ) ] .",
    "the result of the decreased @xmath31 rotation angle is further charge localization in the @xmath55 [ ( b ) ] and @xmath66 and @xmath67 orbitals of equatorial oxygen atoms [ ( c ) ] , hence about the equatorial fe ",
    "o bonds supporting the insulating state and leaving unaltered the polarization of apical oxygen atoms [ ( d ) ] .",
    "our results show that the o @xmath6 and fe @xmath23 orbital polarizations are highly sensitive to the strain state and are mediated largely by the change in the out - of - phase octahedral rotations ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the tensile strain , enhances the @xmath73 rotation pattern , induces a charge transfer into those orbitals responsible for the gap ( _ i.e. _ @xmath55 , and @xmath66/@xmath67 of equatorial oxygen atoms ) : beyond a critical value , the charge becomes delocalized and the insulating gap closes to form a metallic state .",
    "we observe that the insulating phase is lost for strain values greater than 1% , which is in contrast to that seen in rare - earth nickelates @xcite , suggesting the rotation ",
    "orbital polarization interaction and the bd may be either complementary or antagonistic to the mit .",
    "the out - of - phase rotations are also responsible for the broadening of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 orbitals about @xmath44 , which we conjecture would reduce the sharpness of the first - order phase transition .",
    "note that the critical transition temperature for the mit is also believed to be correlated with the size of the bd , our results therefore suggest that strain - engineering of the mit temperature could be challenging in ferrates . on the other hand ,",
    "the structural transition temperature can be kept fixed with increasing strain while the electronic transition can still be tuned by means of the octahedral rotation - induced orbital polarizations .",
    "in summary , we have shown how the sense of the octahedral rotation pattern and not only the magnitude of the rotation distortion is important in engineering the low energy electronic band structure .",
    "we find that while the _ in - phase _ rotations weakly affect the local electronic distribution , the _ out - of - phase _ rotation pattern directs a flow of charge towards its corresponding rotation axis .",
    "the size of the rotation - sense orbital polarization we compute should be experimentally detectable with orbital reflectometry techniques @xcite , across the orthorhombic ( @xmath32 ) to monoclinic ( @xmath77 ) phase transition of cafeo@xmath1 near room temperature . here , the out - of - phase rotation pattern is no longer uniform along [ 110 ] . for charge transfer perovskite oxides , control over the phase of the rotations via heteroepitaxial strain , substrate proximity effects , or superlattice formation provides a promising alternative route to tailor the local orbital polarizations , hence electronic transitions , in correlated materials near electronic phase boundaries . due to the complexity of these interactions driven by cation substitution",

    "<S> we describe a novel octahedral engineering avenue to control the @xmath2 @xmath5 and o @xmath6 orbital polarization through enhancement of the @xmath2o@xmath7 rotation `` sense '' rather than solely through conventional changes to the @xmath2o bond lengths , _ i.e. _ crystal field distortions . using cafeo@xmath1 as a prototypical material , </S>",
