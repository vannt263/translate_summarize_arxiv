    "since 1997 , an international program of gravitational lens monitoring has been carried out at maidanak observatory ( uzbekistan ) by tashkent , moscow and kharkov observational groups . for the period 1997  2003 a huge set of observational data",
    "was gathered for the following well known gravitational lens systems : q2237 + 0305 ( einstein cross ) , sbs1520 + 530 , sbs0909 + 532 , pg1115 + 080 , h1413 + 117 , rx1413 + 117 , rx0921 + 4528 , um673 ( qso0142 - 100 ) , b1422 + 231 .",
    "the aim of the monitoring program is to obtain light curves for these lens systems .",
    "we have developed a photometric method for the reliable treatment of gravitational lenses with a visible lensing galaxy and applied it to the 2 year dataset of q2237 + 0305 .    here , we present results for q2237 + 0305 , a rather complex system which is the object of monitoring programs of many observational groups .",
    "it consists of a barred spiral galaxy at a redshift @xmath0=0.039 , in which @xcite discovered a high - redshift quasar ( @xmath1=1.695 ) .",
    "the location of the lensed images , which are close to the bulge of the lensing galaxy , makes microlensing events highly probable in this system @xcite .",
    "the regular observations of q2237 + 0305 began from the first microlensing event observed in august 1989 by @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to get the light curves of the four quasar components was made by @xcite .",
    "the similar attempt was made in 1994 through constructing light curves which were free from the effects of different spectral bands @xcite .",
    "the long - duration monitoring program of q2237 + 0305 was started in 1990 at the nordic optical telescope @xcite . during this five - year monitoring program microlensing variations",
    "had been detected in all four images .",
    "the most densely sampled four - year monitoring was conducted within the ogle program from august 1997 to november 2000 @xcite .",
    "it revealed brightness variations in all images and range up to 1.2mag for image c in 1999 .",
    "the glitp collaboration presented the results for the period from october 1999 to february 2000 @xcite .",
    "the glitp data , which covered a time - period of greater than one month , began after a high magnification microlensing event was observed for the a component by the ogle collaboration .",
    "the monitoring observations from apache point observatory @xcite presented the light curves for only the a and b components of q2237 + 0305 from june 1995 to january 1998 , but they contained the brightness peak of a component in 1996 .",
    "the results of vri photometry in 1997  1998 from maidanak observatory were published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the combined vri light curves from the monitoring program at the maidanak observatory in 1995  2000 were presented by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present r - band observations of q2237 + 0305 from august 2002 to november 2003 .",
    "the next section describes the conditions of the observations followed by the description of the two - stage image reconstruction technique .",
    "we then show the results of the image reconstruction over the observational period and present a photometric variability plot for the quasar components .",
    "observations of q2237 + 0305 were carried out with the 1.5-m azt-22 telescope of the high - altitude maidanak observatory ( uzbekistan ) using the ln - cooled ccd camera of copenhagen university observatory with the imaging area of 2000@xmath2800 and a pixel size of 15@xmath3 m , giving a spatial sampling 0.26 arcsec pixel@xmath4 .",
    "data were taken in r the gunn filter , which corresponds approximately to the standard johnson - cousins system .",
    "the poor tracking available at the telescope only allowed exposures up to a maximum of 3 minutes . to obtain sufficiently high photometric accuracy with such short exposures ,",
    "the images were taken in series , consisting of 48 frames each .",
    "the seeing conditions are presented in tables  [ photometry02 ]  and  [ photometry03 ] via the values of fwhm for particular nights .",
    "the best quality of the image corresponds to the point source with fwhm=0.75 .",
    "preprocessing of the data ( including bias - level subtraction , flat - field division , sky subtraction and cosmic ray removal ) was done with the standard routines in the munich image data analysis system ( midas ) environment .",
    "several stars in the imaging area were used as reference stars to reduce all frames to the same coordinate system . to increase signal - to - noise ratio , and to reveal underlying galaxy several images with excellent seeing ( fwhm@xmath5 ) were summed before being subjected to photometric processing .",
    "then a subframe of 64 by 64 pixels centred on the nucleus of the galaxy 2237 + 0305 was extracted .",
    "an essential prerequisite for accurate photometry in ground - based images is good seeing well below the source separation . the extremely compact spatial structure of q2237 + 0305 , where the component separation is comparable to the seeing , complicates accurate photometry .",
    "the presence of the lensing galaxy , with a point - like nucleus and an extended light distribution , makes the photometric results dependant on the galaxy model .",
    "this peculiarity leads to poor agreement between the results of different monitoring programs , which adopt different ways to extract the underlying galaxy flux .",
    "these difficulties have been noted by many authors @xcite . in minimization procedures ,",
    "the galaxy brightness distribution is usually represented either analytically @xcite or numerically @xcite . to solve this problem , iterative algorithms",
    "are often used to approximately realize minimization of the @xmath6-function .",
    "these algorithms estimate the flux contribution from the underlying galaxy , which can then be used in the photometry of the lensed images .",
    "such an approach noticeably simplifies the solution procedure , and provides good intrinsic convergence @xcite but unfortunately does not ensure the absence of systematic errors in estimating the magnitudes of the components caused by a poor galaxy model . for the photometry of the data we used a two - stage algorithm developed for the image reconstruction of the objects with point sources superimposed on a smooth background .",
    "the algorithm enables the complex images to be split up into the numerical lensing galaxy and quasar components , and allows the galaxy to be subtracted from the individual images which are under consideration . to optimize the photometric treatment of observational data , the process is divided into two stages : 1 ) combining several images with good seeing and extracting a numerical galaxy model from the combined frame with a regularizing algorithm ; 2 ) processing large numbers of image frames using this numerical galaxy model to get astrometric and photometric characteristics of the gravitational lens system .    _ the first stage . _ the first stage of the algorithm is based on the tikhonov regularization approach .",
    "images obtained on ground - based telescopes affected by the finite instrument resolution and atmospheric perturbations . the simple model of the image formation can be represented as a convolution equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the unknown light distribution of the object , @xmath9 represents the observable light distribution , the kernel of the above equation @xmath10 is the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the estimate of the psf can be obtained from the images of reference stars in the neighbourhood of the object . in this work",
    "two approaches were used to determine the psf .",
    "one approach involves adopting a reference star profile as a numerical point spread function .",
    "this method is free of any assumptions about the shape of the psf , but it depends on the star location because the psf can vary over the frame field .",
    "another approach involves the theoretical elliptical gaussian distribution .",
    "we also used the semi - analytical ras ( rotate - and - stare ) method described by @xcite and employed in the xecclean package by @xcite .",
    "psfs determined with the ras method are in a good agreement with those theoretically modelled by elliptical gaussian distributions .",
    "the psf is constructed 1 ) using an individual star ( @xmath11 ) and 2 ) using the mean brightness distribution obtained via superposition of profiles of reference stars ( @xmath12 ) weighted inversely proportional to their intensities .",
    "the terminology of @xcite and @xcite was adopted for the reference stars .",
    "we found that the best model for the psf was obtained using the @xmath11 star .",
    "the observable data are registered on the pixel grid with some error .",
    "the presence of photon noise and , as a consequence , the error of the input data complicates the problem ( [ fredholm ] ) which otherwise can be solved in fourier space .",
    "so , the problem of image reconstruction lies in finding the approximate solution of the equation ( [ fredholm ] ) with the approximate kernel @xmath13 with known error estimation _",
    "h _ : @xmath14 and having at our disposal the noisy data @xmath15 and the estimate of the noise level : @xmath16 here , barred letters @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote exact , non - error contaminated , psf and observed image respectively .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the norm in the @xmath20 set of functions .",
    "it is assumed that the observed image @xmath15 belongs to the space @xmath21 of square integrable functions with the norm : @xmath22 the estimation of the @xmath23 can be calculated as the total noise integrated over the resulting subframe : @xmath24 where _ n _ is the number of summed frames with the same exposure time ; _ i@xmath25 _  counts in the _ ij_-pixel of the subframe ; @xmath26  gain factor of the ccd camera ; _ r _  readout noise .",
    "the error of the operator ( [ hh ] ) depends on the method of psf modeling .",
    "if the relative error of psf modeling is @xmath27 , then the error of definition of the operator can be estimated as follows : @xmath28    to reduce the systematic errors connected with the galaxy model we try to construct the perfect galaxy model applying regularization techniques . the convolution equation ( [ fredholm ] ) with the error contaminated right - hand side belongs to the class of ill - posed inverse problems .",
    "the solution may be non - unique , and small variations in the input data may lead to large variations in the solution . to solve such problems a regularization method",
    "was developed by a. tikhonov @xcite that allows to find approximate solution taking into account _ a priori _ information about the structure of the object .",
    "this unique solution , which possesses a specified degree of smoothness and provides a physical representation of the lensing galaxy s flux distribution , tends to the true solution in the norm of the functional space chosen when the errors in input data tend to zero .",
    "the regularization requires construction of an algorithm to control the trade - off between ( a ) the assumptions about both the smoothness and the structure of the sought solution and ( b ) its consistency with the data . the key concept of the algorithm is a smoothing function of the following kind : @xmath29=\\|t*z - u\\|^{2}_{\\rm l_2}+\\alpha\\cdot\\omega[z]\\ ] ] here the first term represents the squared discrepancy between the model and data , @xmath11 is the regularization parameter which controls the balance between the consistency of the sought solution with the right side of ( [ fredholm ] ) and the smoothness of the sought solution , @xmath30 $ ] is a stabilizer function through which _ a priori _ information is introduced into the problem formulation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath31 be the extremum of the function @xmath32 $ ] on @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath31 is the solution of the minimization problem for @xmath32 $ ] on the chosen set of functions ( possibly with some constraints ) .",
    "the choice of the regularization parameter @xmath11 , which provides uniform residuals and the necessary smoothness of the solution , is crucial for solving ill - posed problems .",
    "generally , it should depend on the input data , the errors , and the method of approximation of the initial problem .",
    "one of the way to co - ordinate the regularization parameter with the error of the input information is the discrepancy principle  adoption of @xmath34 satisfying :",
    "@xmath35 the regularization parameter @xmath11 is chosen such that the corresponding residual ( the left hand side of ( [ discprinc ] ) ) is equal to the a priori specified bound ( right hand side ) for the noise level in the image . the regularization method with",
    "@xmath11 chosen according to the discrepancy principle ( [ discprinc ] ) is convergent and of optimal order @xcite .",
    "provided that the regularization parameter @xmath11 is chosen according to this rule , the solution @xmath31 of the minimization problem for @xmath36 $ ] can be considered as an approximate solution .",
    "the approximate solution obtained using this method goes to the true solution when the error of input data goes to zero .    when the kernel @xmath13 in ( [ fredholm ] ) is known inexactly",
    ", one can use the generalized discrepancy principle @xcite which lies in solving the following equation : @xmath37 where @xmath38  is called the generalized discrepancy : @xmath39\\right)^{2 } \\label{nevdef}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath38 is strictly monotonic and the root of ( [ nev ] ) can be found by bisection or some other standard method .",
    "this is an _ a posteriori _ method of choosing the regularization parameter , because , to find the root of equation ( [ nev ] ) , one needs to minimize the smoothing function at every iteration by @xmath11 .",
    "given the estimations of @xmath23 and @xmath40 we used the generalized discrepancy principle to choose the regularization parameter .",
    "various assumptions about the structure of the object under study can also be taken into account .",
    "images of close quadruple gravitational lens systems consist of multiple overlapped quasar images superimposed on a lensing galaxy .",
    "so , the image can be decomposed into two constituent parts : the sum of four @xmath41-functions and smooth background ( galaxy ) . written for the pixel grid ,",
    "that assumption is represented as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the intensities of point sources with coordinates @xmath44 , @xmath45 are kronnecker deltas , @xmath46 is the solution s component corresponding to the lensing galaxy .",
    "numerical simulations revealed that introducing the assumption about the closeness of the real galaxy light distribution to some analytical profile produces more stable results for the reconstruction .",
    "in this work we assume that the light distribution in the central region of the galaxy is well - modelled by a generalized de vaucouleurs profile @xcite , known as sersic s model @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 corresponds to de vaucouleurs model ) , @xmath51 is an effective radius , @xmath52 is an intensity within the effective radius , and @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are measured from the centre along the major and minor axes .",
    "given the image , one can represent it in accordance with ( [ split ] ) where the lensing galaxy is described with the analytical model ( [ gal ] ) .",
    "parameters of the analytical model are fitted by means of minimization of the @xmath57-function : @xmath58@xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the noise in each pixel of the frame .",
    "the positions of quasar components @xmath62 , the corresponding amplitudes @xmath63 , and the analytical galaxy model parameters are fitted .",
    "powell @xcite method is used as a minimization routine .    given the assumption that the real galaxy light distribution is close to the analytical profile the stabilizer function in ( [ regular ] )",
    "can be written as follows : @xmath64 = \\|g^{\\rm num}-g^{\\rm mod}\\|_{\\rm g}^{2 } + \\beta \\sum_{q=1}^{4 } a_{q}^{2 } \\label{stab},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is a sought numerical galaxy model , @xmath66 is the analytical galaxy model .",
    "the second term in the right - hand side is introduced in order to penalize values of quasar intensities that are too large compared to the lensing galaxy .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 is chosen on the basis of the model calculations in the way that both terms in the stabilizer function are of the same order .",
    "such an approach enables probable artefacts in the galaxy brightness distribution ( ` holes ' at the positions of quasar components ) to be excluded .",
    "after the parameters of the analytical galaxy model @xmath68 have been found , this model is used for construction of the stabilizer function and as an initial approach for minimization of the smoothing function : @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71      due to the huge number of free parameters the process of minimizing the smoothing function is time - consuming .",
    "the main result at this stage is the numerical galaxy model .",
    "after the accurate numerical galaxy model is found , the huge data set for the same observational period can be processed in a much shorter space of time .",
    "the equal brightness contours for the central part of the galaxy for both analytical and numerical galaxy models are presented in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "the mean values of the galaxy parameters from the castle collaboration in h filter , the glitp collaboration , and our values derived from the first stage of the two - stage image reconstruction algorithm in r filter are combined in table  [ galaxypar ] .",
