    "i hope this note will nevertheless be of interest to people in both fields .",
    "i have no present plans of carrying these investigations further ; others are welcome to do so .",
    "since obtaining the main results of this paper , i have learned that many of them were already in the literature , and have added references ; thus , this is now a hybrid research / survey paper .",
    "i am grateful to kira adaricheva , j.b.nation , marina semenova , fred wehrung , and the referee , for corrections , information on the literature , and many other helpful comments .",
    "whereas this note looks at conditions satisfied _ universally _ in various lattices of convex sets , the papers @xcite , @xcite , and others cited there study sufficient conditions for lattices to be embeddable in such lattices , in other words , _ existential _ properties of such lattices .",
    "( this note includes one result of that type , in  [ nhrlmsc ] . )",
    "the varieties of lattices we will be examining in the first few sections are those listed in    [ x.13 ] each lattice in the sequence @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 is embeddable in the next . hence @xmath48 @xmath49    on the one hand",
    ", @xmath28 is a sublattice of @xmath50 on the other , one can embed @xmath14 in @xmath51 by sending each @xmath52 to the cone @xmath53 the inclusions  ( [ x.14 ] ) follow from these embeddings .",
    "clearly @xmath54 is a trivial lattice with unique element @xmath55 on the other hand , @xmath56 is a two - element lattice , so @xmath57 is the variety of distributive lattices .",
    "hence the first inclusion of  ( [ x.14 ] ) is strict .",
    "we shall see below that the next inclusion is an equality , while all subsequent inclusions are again strict .",
    "let us set up notation for some lattice identities .",
    "[ x.20 ] for each positive integer @xmath58 we shall denote by @xmath59 ( for `` @xmath6-distributivity '' ) the lattice - relation in @xmath60 arguments @xmath61 @xmath62 we shall say that a lattice @xmath24 satisfies `` the identity @xmath63 '' if  ( [ x.21 ] ) holds for all @xmath64\\,\\dots,\\,y_{n+1}\\in l.$ ]    thus , @xmath65 is the ordinary distributivity identity .",
    "the use of the subscript @xmath6 for an identity in @xmath60 variables which is symmetric in @xmath66 of these may seem confusing ; a useful mnemonic is that @xmath67 is the identity that allows one to `` reduce meets of @xmath25 with larger joins to meets of @xmath25 with @xmath6-fold joins '' .",
    "an additional occasion for confusion will arise when we see that the first of these identities to be satisfied by @xmath14 is not @xmath68 but @xmath69 this will be a consequence of the fact that an @xmath6-dimensional simplex has @xmath66 vertices .",
    "note that the left - hand side of  ( [ x.21 ] ) is @xmath70 the right - hand side for any family of elements of any lattice , since each of the @xmath66 terms in the outer join on the right is majorized by the left - hand side .",
    "so to verify any instance of ( [ x.21 ] ) it suffices to prove `` @xmath71 '' .",
    "the pioneering work on identities satisfied by lattices of convex sets was done by a.p.huhn @xcite , @xcite . the results in this and the next three sections will extend huhn s by approximately doubling both the family of lattices and the family of identities considered , and formalizing some general techniques .",
    "huhn s results will be recovered along with our new ones .",
    "the key to huhn s and our results on @xmath67 ( and some related identities ) is the following standard result in the theory of convex sets . strictly speaking ,",
    "it is the first sentence below that is carathodory s theorem , while the second is a well - known refinement thereof ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , line 4 ) .",
    "intuitively , that second sentence says that from an arbitrary point @xmath72 we can `` see '' any other point of @xmath73 against a background of ( or embedded in ) some with vertices in @xmath74 + * carathodory s theorem . * _ if @xmath8 is a subset of @xmath9 then each element @xmath75 belongs to @xmath76 for some @xmath66 points @xmath77 moreover , @xmath78 can be taken to be any pre - specified element of @xmath74 _    in each paragraph of the next lemma , it is the first assertion that is due to huhn .",
    "[ x.23 ] for every natural number @xmath6 and @xmath79-tuple of convex sets @xmath80 the relation @xmath81 holds . moreover , if @xmath82 and ( at least ) some two of the sets @xmath83 have nonempty intersection , then @xmath59 holds .",
    "hence @xmath14 satisfies the identity @xmath84 and for @xmath85 @xmath28 satisfies the identity  @xmath86    we shall prove the assertions of the first paragraph , which clearly imply those of the second .    to get the first assertion ,",
    "let @xmath87 and let @xmath88 be a point of the convex set described by the left - hand side of  ( [ x.21 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath88 belongs to both @xmath25 and @xmath89 carathodory s theorem now says that @xmath88 belongs to the convex hull of @xmath66 points of @xmath90 hence to the join of at most @xmath66 of the @xmath91 so it belongs to one of the terms on the right - hand side of  ( [ x.21 ] ) , hence to their join , as required .    to prove the second assertion ,",
    "let @xmath92 and suppose that two of @xmath83 have a point @xmath78 in common .",
    "given @xmath88 in the left - hand side of the desired instance of  ( [ x.21 ] ) , we see from the last sentence of our statement of carathodory s theorem that @xmath88 will belong to the convex hull of @xmath78 and some @xmath6 other points of @xmath93 the latter points will lie in the union of some @xmath6 of the @xmath94 s , and since those @xmath6 of our @xmath66 sets leave out only one , they do not leave out both of the sets known to contain @xmath95 so that family of @xmath6 @xmath94 s contains the @xmath66 points whose convex hull is known to contain @xmath96 and the conclusion follows as before .    note that for all @xmath97 we have @xmath98 moreover , if @xmath99 then @xmath100 thus , any identities proved for the lattice @xmath28 will hold in @xmath101 for every nonempty set  @xmath74    one may ask whether , in the first assertion of the above lemma , we have failed to use the full strength of carathodory s theorem .",
    "that theorem says that the convex hull of any family of @xmath102 points is the union of the hulls of its @xmath103-element subfamilies , hence for each such @xmath104 we may deduce an identity like @xmath84 but with the join of @xmath105 rather than @xmath60 convex sets @xmath17 on the left , and expressions involving all the @xmath103-fold subjoins thereof on the right .",
    "our @xmath106 is the case @xmath107    but in fact , the identities so obtained are all equivalent to @xmath69 to derive them from it , note first that if in @xmath106 we substitute for @xmath108 the expression @xmath109 then the left - hand side becomes @xmath110 while on the right , some of the joins involve @xmath66 of the @xmath94 s and others involve @xmath111 if we again apply @xmath106 to the latter joins , we get precisely the @xmath112 case of the class of identities discussed above .",
    "the identities with still larger @xmath105 are gotten by repeating this argument .",
    "conversely , one can get @xmath106 from any of these identities by substituting for the @xmath17 with @xmath113 repetitions of @xmath114 and discarding from the outer join on the right - hand side joinands majorized by others .",
    "let us also note that @xmath115 indeed , the identity with @xmath116 @xmath94 s that we just showed equivalent to @xmath106 has the same left - hand side as @xmath117 while the right - hand side of @xmath118 can be seen to lie , in an arbitrary lattice , between the two sides of that identity . in particular , the identities obtained in lemma  [ x.23 ] are successively weaker for larger @xmath58 as is reasonable in view of  ( [ x.14 ] ) .",
    "the argument proving lemma  [ x.23 ] ( for simplicity let us limit ourselves to the first assertion thereof ) can be formulated in a more general context , and the above observations on identities allow us to obtain a converse in that context , which we record below , though we shall not use it . recall that a closure operator on a set @xmath119 is called `` finitary '' ( or `` algebraic '' )",
    "if the closure of every subset @xmath120 is the union of the closures of the finite subsets of @xmath74    [ x.24 ] let @xmath121 be a finitary closure operator on a set @xmath122 such that every singleton subset of @xmath119 is closed , or more generally , such that the closure of every singleton is join - irreducible ; and let @xmath6 be a positive integer .",
    "then the lattice of closed subsets of @xmath119 under @xmath121 satisfies @xmath67 if and only if @xmath121 has the property  that the closure of every set is the union of the closures of its @xmath123-element subsets .",
    "`` if '' is shown exactly as in the proof of lemma  [ x.23 ] .",
    "conversely , suppose the lattice of @xmath121-closed subsets of @xmath119 satisfies @xmath68 and let @xmath124 for some @xmath125 by the assumption that @xmath121 is finitary , @xmath126 for some @xmath127 if @xmath128 we are done ; if not , let us rewrite the condition @xmath126 as a lattice relation , @xmath129 by the preceding discussion , @xmath67 implies the identity in @xmath105 variables which , when applied to the right - hand side of the above relation , turns the relation into @xmath130 where the subscript to the outer join means that @xmath131 ranges over all @xmath6-element subsets of @xmath132 now by assumption @xmath133 is join - irreducible , hence it equals one of the joinands on the right , showing @xmath88 to be in the closure of some set of @xmath6 @xmath134 s , as required .",
    "we also appear to have used less than the full force of the middle sentence of lemma  [ x.23 ] ( the stronger relation holding when at least two of the @xmath94 s have nonempty intersection ) in getting the second assertion of the last sentence of that lemma ( the stronger identity for @xmath135 since the latter assertion concerns the case where not just two , but all the @xmath17 ( and also @xmath136 have a point in common .",
    "there is no evident way to take advantage of the weaker hypothesis of said middle sentence when working in the lattice @xmath137 but might we be able to use it to prove some new identity for @xmath50 for example , by finding a relation that holds , on the one hand , whenever a family of elements @xmath138 satisfies @xmath68 and also , for some trivial reason , whenever @xmath139 ?",
    "one relation with these properties can be obtained by taking the meet of each side of @xmath67 with @xmath140 unfortunately , this turns out to be the trivial identity : both sides simplify to @xmath141 in any lattice .",
    "however , we can circumvent this by first taking the join of both sides of @xmath67 with a new indeterminate @xmath142 and only then taking meets with @xmath140    we shall in fact see that this provides what lemma  [ x.23 ] failed to : an identity holding in @xmath14 but not in @xmath143 however , the verification of an example showing the failure of this identity in the larger lattice ( and of a similar example we will need later ) is messy if done entirely `` by hand '' ; so we shall establish in this section some general criteria for certain sorts of inequalities to be strict .",
    "the last assertions of the next two lemmas clearly imply , for @xmath14 and @xmath51 respectively , that if we are given expressions @xmath144 @xmath145 and @xmath146 in some lattice indeterminates such that the inequality @xmath147 is known to hold identically in our lattice , then we can write down another inequality holding identically among expressions in a slightly larger set of indeterminates , for which equality will hold whenever either @xmath148 equals @xmath149 or @xmath146 equals the least lattice - element ( i.e. , @xmath150 respectively @xmath151 but which will fail in all other cases . this is what is logically called for by the program sketched above .",
    "however the earlier parts of these lemmas give some simpler inequalities for which the same is true if the hypotheses hold `` in a sufficiently strong way '' , and it will turn out that in the applications where we need to show failure of an identity , we will be able to use these simpler formulas .    in the statements of these lemmas , for @xmath152 `` the ray drawn from @xmath134 through @xmath153 '' will mean @xmath154 even in the degenerate case @xmath155 where this set is the singleton @xmath156    [ x.28 ] let @xmath6 be any natural number , and let @xmath157 and @xmath146 be three elements of @xmath158 then + ( i ) the following conditions are equivalent :    \\(a ) there exists @xmath159 such that @xmath160    \\(b ) there exist a point @xmath161 and a point @xmath162 such that the ray drawn from @xmath134 through @xmath88 contains no point of @xmath163 + ( ii ) the following conditions are equivalent :    \\(a ) there exist @xmath164 such that @xmath165    \\(b ) @xmath166 and @xmath146 is nonempty .    in view of the hypothesis @xmath167 the relation `` @xmath168 '' always holds in the inequalities of  ( i)(a ) and",

    "( i do not know whether the theorems of helly , carathodory and radon hold in that context , nor how much of what i have justified as geometrically evident may rely on properties of the reals . )",
    "a straightforward generalization of these results could not , of course , extend to  [ nhcp ] , on compact convex sets , since over an ordered field which is not locally compact , the only nonempty compact convex sets are the singletons , which do not form a lattice .",
    "one might be able to prove results like those of that section with `` compact '' replaced by `` closed and bounded '' , but new proofs would be needed , since the theorem of minkowski we used there is not true in that context .",
    "later sections depend to varying degrees on that one",
