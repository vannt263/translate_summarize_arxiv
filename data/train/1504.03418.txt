    "this is the third paper in a series describing the  infrared search for extraterrestrial civilizations with large energy supplies . the first two papers @xcite provide the justification and framework for the search .",
    "here we give a brief summary of those works , and the purpose of this paper .",
    "@xcite argued that the failure of seti to date was because humanity is alone in the milky way , based on a comparison of likely colonization timescales for the milky way and its age .",
    "hart s argument also implies that any galaxy with a spacefaring species will become thoroughly colonized in a time short compared to the galaxy s age , suggesting that most galaxies should either contain no spacefaring species or be filled with them .",
    "@xcite parameterized potential alien civilizations by their energy supply compared to the starlight available to it , with a type civilizations ( k1 in our notation ) commanding its planet s entire stellar insolation , a type civilization commanding an entire star s luminosity ( i.e.  a dyson sphere , k2 ) , and a type civilization ( k3 ) commanding most of the stellar luminosity in a galaxy .",
    "expressed in these terms , hart s argument is that the timescale for the appearance of the first k2 to its growth into a k3 is very short , implying that we should expect many k3 civilizations in the universe if spacefaring life is common .    indeed , the technological sophistication required to construct a dyson sphere seems far greater than that required for achieving interstellar travel : while humanity s solar panels currently fall short of complete coverage of the sun by a factor of @xmath4 , our deepest space probes today these fall short of the distance to the nearest star by a factor of only a few thousand .",
    "if hart s reasoning is sound , then we should expect that , unless intelligent , spacefaring life is unique to earth _ in the local universe _ , other galaxies should have galaxy - spanning supercivilizations , and a search for k3 s may be fruitful . if there is a flaw in it , then intelligent , spacefaring life may be endemic to the milky way in the form of many k2 s , in which case a search within the milky way would be more likely to succeed .",
    "it is prudent , therefore , to pursue both routes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that waste heat would be an inevitable signature of extraterrestrial civilization , and that such signatures might be detectable to mid - infrared ( mir ) instrumentation for civilizations with energy supplies comparable to the luminosity of their host star .",
    "the first effective all - sky search sensitive to such namesake `` dyson spheres '' was performed by _ iras _ , but the infrared cirrus and the poor angular resolution of _ iras _ limited its sensitivity to only the brightest sources .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the _ iras _ low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) to determine whether candidate dyson spheres seds were consistent with blackbodies with @xmath5 = 100600k .",
    "@xcite concluded from infrared colors and low resolution spectra that the best of these of the most dyson sphere candidates were typically reddened and dusty objects such as heavily extinguished stars , protostars , mira variables , agb stars , and planetary nebulae ( pns ) .",
    "nonetheless , of the 11,000 sources he studied , @xcite identified a few weak dyson sphere candidates with spectra consistent with carbon stars .",
    "one candidate , iras 20369 + 5131 , showed a nearly featureless blackbody spectrum with @xmath5 = 376k , but carrigan concluded it is likely a distant red giant with no detectable sic emission .",
    "@xcite performed a series of follow - up searches of sources with anomalously red @xmath6 colors @xcite , and found no highly complete dyson spheres around any of the 365 solar - type stars within 25 pc studied , or another 180 stars within the same distance @xcite .    to date , the only search for the waste heat of a k3 civilizations in the peer - reviewed literature has been that of @xcite , who searched for outliers to the tully - fischer relation to identify k3s intercepting a significant fraction of their starlight .",
    "@xcite also suggested searching for the morphological signatures of k3s , especially in elliptical galaxies .    the advent of large solid angle , sensitive mir surveys makes a waste - heat based k3 search more feasible today .",
    "the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , * ? ? ? * ) performed an all - sky mir survey at 3.4 , 4.62 12 and 22 @xmath7 ( the @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 , and @xmath11 bands ) with superior angular resolution ( by a factor of 5 ) and sensitivity ( by a factor of 1000 ) than _ iras_. _ wise _ is thus the first sensitive survey for both k2 s in the milky way and k3",
    "s among the approximately @xmath12 galaxies it resolved . the _ spitzer space telescope _ is another powerful tool for waste heat searches , having superior sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "its survey of the galactic plane will be a powerful tool in the search for k2 s in the milky way .",
    "since its large area surveys are generally restricted to star - forming regions and the galactic plane , where sensitivity to k3 s is more limited , we have restricted our efforts in this paper to .      in @xcite",
    ", we developed the agent formalism for quantifying the expected mir spectra from galaxies hosting k3s in terms of the energy supply of an alien civilization , and outlined the methodology of the _ glimpsing heat from alien technology _",
    "(  ) search for such civilizations in the local universe using the results of the  all - sky mir survey .",
    "in particular , we argued in that work that extended sources have the lowest false positive rate because many of the confounding sources , primarily dusty and extinguished stars and cosmological sources , would not be present in that sample .",
    "the agent formalism parameterizes the power used by an alien civilization in terms of starlight absorbed ( represented by the parameter @xmath13 ) , energy generated by other means ( @xmath14 ) , thermal waste heat emitted ( @xmath15 ) , and other energy disposal ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "most relevant to the present paper are the parameters @xmath15 ( waste heat luminosity , expressed as a fraction of the starlight available to the civilization ) and @xmath17 , the characteristic temperature of the waste heat ( which dictates its infrared colors ) . for values of @xmath18 in the 100600 k range , values of @xmath15 near 1 would imply that most of the luminosity of a galaxy is in the mir ( in the form of the waste heat from alien engines ) , while values near 0 would imply that the alien waste heat was very small compared to the output of the stars in the galaxy . for dust - free elliptical galaxies with little of their luminosity in the mir , values of @xmath15 of a few percent would be detectable as an anomalous mir excess .      as an essential step in our waste heat search , we have produced a clean catalog of the reddest sources _ resolved _ by .",
    "the purpose of our focus , in this work , on resolved sources is twofold : resolved sources present their own challenges of interpretation and photometry , necessitating this separate effort ; and we wish to first deal with a relatively small and clean sample of nearby galaxies , consistent with a search for nearby k3 s .  resolves approximately @xmath19 galaxies ( see section  [ number ] ) .",
    "sources unresolved by  include a wide variety of potential false positives , such as false detections , data artifacts , cosmologically redshifted objects , dusty objects at cosmological distances , dusty stars , and heavily extinguished stars .",
    "the study of these sources requires a different sorts of analysis from those needed for nearby galaxies , which we will describe in later papers .",
    "by contrast , there are many fewer , and more easily excluded , sources of false positives among the extended sources in the all sky catalog .",
    "our primary objective in this paper is to `` map the landscape '' among galaxies resolved by  by identifying the nature of the very reddest of these extended sources in the  all - sky survey , using several metrics for `` red - ness '' , including the agent parameter @xmath15 .",
    "a byproduct of this effort is a clean catalog of the reddest extended sources in , which we present here .",
    "our secondary objective is to identify and explain the most extreme objects in this catalog , which by their superlative nature are inherently scientifically interesting , regardless of the origin of their mir luminosity . in most cases ,",
    "these are well - known objects ; in many of the remaining cases their nature seems clear .",
    "a few cases , however , are new to the scientific literature and their nature is uncertain . these sources of uncertain nature",
    "will be natural candidates for followup , and those that appear consistent with kardashev civilizations warrant followup by communication seti efforts , in particular .    as a tertiary objective , we place a zeroth - order upper limit on the energy supplies of nearby k3s by identifying the most mir - luminous galaxies in our sample . this upper limit",
    "can be pushed down to the degree that these galaxies mir emission can be shown have purely natural origins .",
    "a rigorous upper limit will require a more detailed analysis of these galaxies seds , and a more precise calculation of the number of galaxies considered in our sample .",
    "we save this exercise for another paper in this series .",
    "finally , we also illustrate the waste heat approach by performing a quick check of two classes of anomalous galaxies to confirm that they are not hosts to mir - bright k3 s .      in section  [ sample ]",
    "we describe how we have analyzed the  all - sky catalog , and how we performed a series of cuts to select a sample of only real , red , extended sources ( our `` extended gold sample '' of 30,808 sources ) .",
    "sections  [ calibrate ] describes how we calibrated the  photometry , and our estimates of our photometric precision .",
    "section  [ classification ] describes our efforts to classify the sources in the extended gold sample , mostly via simbad object types , so that we could identify previously unstudied sources and reject many galactic sources .",
    "section  [ visualgrading ] describes our more detailed efforts to understand the reddest sources in the extended gold sample using careful visual inspection and literature searches .",
    "section  [ platinum ] describes how we performed a second round of vetting on the extended gold sample , using our calibrated photometry from section  [ calibrate ] , our classifications from section  [ classification ] , and our visual inspections and literature searches from section  [ visualgrading ] to confidently and carefully identify the reddest sources and determine the best photometry for them on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the result is the 563 source `` platinum sample , '' which we present in our catalog , and whose fields are described in table  [ fits ] .",
    "section  [ sec : extreme ] describes the reddest objects in the platinum sample , for several definitions of `` red '' : all six combinations of the  bandpasses and the agent parameter @xmath15 .",
    "section  [ new ] describes five sources that are effectively new to science , having little or no literature presence ( beyond having been detected with _ iras _ ) .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] , and in the appendices we use the  imagery to examine two categories of anomalous galaxies , dark galaxies and so - called `` passive spirals , '' and show that they do not exhibit sufficient mir emission to have their anomalous natures explained by the presence of a k3 .",
    "the  mission began scientific operations on 2010 january 7 at wavelengths of 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath7 m , hereafter referred to as _ w1",
    ", w2 , w3 _ , and _ w4 _ , respectively .",
    "the all - sky data release was subsequently issued on 2012 march 14 and reached 5@xmath20 point source sensitivities in unconfused regions to better than 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 and 6 mjy , respectively @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a more recent data release by the  collaboration , dubbed allwise was issued on 2013 november 13 . the added sensitivity and depth , proper motion measurements and improved",
    "flux variability information in the allwise data products means that they supersede the earlier all - sky data release catalog and atlas for _ most _ uses .",
    "the  team suggests that the all - sky release catalog may have better photometric information for objects brighter than saturation limits in _",
    "w1 _ and _ w2 _ ( _ w1_@xmath21 8.1 mag and _ w2_@xmath216.7 mag ) . given that our project was well underway before the allwise data release was issued , and the fact that allwise does not add many ( @xmath22 ) new , bright and extended sources in w3 , we rely on the all - sky data release measurements for this analysis .      the following methodology was used to select the full sample of 12@xmath7m - selected sources with extended photometric profiles from the  all - sky catalog .",
    "the instrumental profile - fit reduced @xmath23 ( w3rchi2 ) was used to distinguish sources with extended profiles ( w3rchi2 @xmath24 3 ) from sources with point source profiles ( w3rchi2 @xmath213 ) .",
    "given that the majority of sources in the wise all - sky catalog are unresolved in w3 , i.e. angular sizes @xmath25 , we adopt a conservative @xmath23 threshold of 3 , which excludes only a small number of marginally resolved sources while admitting a large but manageable number of point sources with anomalously poor point - spread function ( psf ) fits .",
    "we also required that the uncertainty in the w3 `` standard '' aperture magnitude to be measured ( i.e.  not null ) .",
    "a null result means that the w3 `` standard '' aperture magnitude is a limit , or that no aperture measurement was possible .",
    "finally , we applied a cut in the galactic latitude ( @xmath2 ) to remove contamination from nebular emission in the galactic plane :          the  all - sky database provides photometry measurements using a variety of methods : psf profile fitting , variable aperture photometry ( eight circular apertures ) , curve of growth ( cog ) aperture photometry , and elliptical aperture photometry ( for sources matched to the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) ) .",
    "the profile fitting photometry is referred to as w#mpro and is defined as the magnitude measured with profile - fitting photometry .",
    "in addition to magnitudes this procedure also derives the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and wrchi2 ( i.e. , the goodness of fit to the psf model of the source ) or the goodness of fit to a psf model of the source .    the cog or `` standard '' aperture photometry is referred to as w#mag . according to the  explanatory supplement `` this is the curve - of - growth corrected source brightness measured within an 8.25radius circular aperture centered on the source position .",
    "the background sky reference level is measured in an annular region with inner radius of 50  and outer radius of 70 '' .",
    "the  pipeline performed nested circular aperture photometry .",
    "they used eight apertures from 5.5  to 24.75  in w1-w3 and 11  to 49.5  in w4 ] .",
    "they provide these in the form of parameters named w#mag_1 for the first aperture of 5.5@xmath27 in w1 through w3 and 11@xmath27 in w4 , w#mag_2 for the 2nd aperture , w#mag_3 for the 3rd aperture and so on .",
    "the elliptical aperture measurements , referred to as w#gmag were based on matched sources between  and the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) .",
    "the shape of the elliptical aperture was determined by utilizing the shape information of the source provided by the 2mass xsc .",
    "we discuss the uncertainties in our best photometry from calibrating aperture magnitudes to careful extended source photometry in section  [ calibrate ] .",
    "since our analysis is primarily interested in identifying galaxy - scale extraterrestrial civilizations k3s , we required that photometric measurements of extended sources in  be as reliable as possible .",
    "the psf profile fitting photometry is best used when extracting photometry from point - like sources in the  survey . for the majority of extended sources in",
    ", the cog photometry generally provides more reliable measurements , though the strict 8.25@xmath27 radius circular aperture fails for large and extended galaxies .",
    "measuring reliable photometry for extended galaxies has historically proven to be a non - trivial and difficult task , the reason being that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes , and a single `` standard '' aperture fails to encompass the full range of galaxy sizes and structures .",
    "recently , @xcite have attempted to extract reliable galaxy photometry for extended sources in the  catalog .",
    "they have developed a complex algorithm in order to construct the  high resolution galaxy atlas and present their initial results in @xcite .",
    "even more recently , tom jarrett has measured reliable photometry for @xmath28 extended sources in the  catalog contained within the south galactic cap ( sgc : @xmath29 ) .",
    "we use this analysis to calibrate the aperture magnitudes as presented by the  all - sky database , as we describe in section  [ calibrate ]      in order to remove spurious sources we use the contamination and confusion flags ( cc_flag ) given for w3 . in figure",
    "[ flow ] , we describe the definitions and provide the number counts of objects having the various cc_flags .",
    "we retain sources with the following cc_flag : ` 0',`d',`h ' , and ` o ' .",
    "we consider sources with cc_flag ` p',`p',`d ' , ` h ' and ` o ' to be contaminated and we removed them from further analysis .",
    "our decision for choosing these particular flags are motivated on empirical examination of a significant fraction of the flagged entries ( i.e.  we found that the rejected flags have very good reliability in flagging false sources , but the ones we retain often appear for real sources ) . using these quality flags reduces the 12@xmath7 m sample to 132,651 sources .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ galex ] shows @xmath30 colors for our sample . in agreement with @xcite",
    "we find that most red spirals have @xmath31 , with some scattering to higher values ( consistent with some having extreme extinction ) .",
    "eight galaxies in our sample have @xmath32 which would put them firmly in the `` red sequence '' of passive galaxies , if they were unextinguished .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ galex ] shows a  color - color plot of the entire sample ( irrespective of the availability of galex nuv data ) , with the anomalously red galaxies highlighted .",
    "five of these sources have moderately red @xmath33 colors , consistent with high rates of star formation . either these five galaxies suffer from significant extinction , or they are examples of anomalous mir - bright , passive spiral galaxies , perhaps consistent with a k3 .",
    "visual examination reveals that none are edge - on ; all are at modest inclination .",
