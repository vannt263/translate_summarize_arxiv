    "for more general indexes of refraction @xmath6 , may be inadequate to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution for .",
    "as an example , one can think to an index of refraction which has some angular dependence , like @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", it is known that the energy concentrates on lines rather than radiating in all directions ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and a pointwise condition like seems to be not appropriate .",
    "an extension of to more general settings is given by the following condition @xmath13 see @xcite . in @xcite , it is proven that guarantees the uniqueness of the outgoing solution of under very general assumptions on @xmath6 .",
    "as an example , we mention that applies to an index of refraction which satisfies @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a smooth angularly dependent function and @xmath16 is a perturbation with suitable decay at infinity ( like @xmath17 for some constant @xmath18 ) . for a correct and complete statement of the assumptions on @xmath6 , we refer to @xcite .",
    "we remark that there are some extension of to the helmholtz equation with a magnetic potential ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as far as the authors know , there are not results in this direction for the full maxwell s equations .",
    "a challenging issue in computational studies related to is how to deal numerically with the unbounded domain .",
    "usually , one has to introduce a ( bounded ) computational domain @xmath19 and then prescribe boundary conditions on @xmath20 which approximate the problem in the whole space . as it is well - known , a large amount of work has been done on this kind of problems .",
    "the most used methods are based on _ local or nonlocal conditions _ involving @xmath9 ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , approximations of the _ dirichlet - to - neumann map _ ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , _ infinite element schemes _ ( @xcite ) , _ boundary element methods _ ( see @xcite ) and",
    "the _ perfectly matched layer method _ ( @xcite,@xcite ) . for a deeper understanding of these problems and more recent developments",
    ", the interested reader can refer to the references cited in @xcite .",
    "starting from , in @xcite we proposed a new approach to the computational study of the helmholtz equation in unbounded domains .",
    "the idea is the following : we fix a computational bounded domain @xmath19 and approximate the solution of and by the minimizer @xmath21 of the following constrained optimization problem : @xmath22:\\",
    "w \\textmd { satifies } \\delta w + k^2 n(x)^2 w = f \\textmd { in } \\omega\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath23= { \\int\\limits}_{\\omega } \\big| \\nabla w(x ) - ikn(x ) w(x ) \\frac{x}{|x| } \\big|^2   \\frac{dx}{1+|x|}.\\ ] ] in @xcite we proved the existence and uniqueness of the minimizer @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 converges to the outgoing solution in @xmath24 norm as the computational domain @xmath19 enlarges and tends to cover the whole space .",
    "more precisely , if we consider @xmath25 ( the ball or radius @xmath26 centered at the origin ) , then for any fixed @xmath27 we have that @xmath28 as @xmath29 ; here , @xmath9 is the solution of satisfying .",
    "this approach is remarkable because : ( i ) it applies to a wide range of problems and for a large variety of indexes of refraction and source functions ; ( ii ) numerical evidence ( see @xcite ) shows that the geometry of the computational domain does not influence the accuracy of the numerical solution relevantly ; ( iii ) it is suitable to be extended to other scattering problems ( we have in mind the waveguide problem by using the results in @xcite,@xcite@xcite ) . on the other hand , the method has a slow convergence rate ( in @xcite , it is proved that @xmath30 as @xmath31 ) , and the computational cost is expensive ( which is due to the volume integral formulation of the radiation condition ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned , this approach is of easy implementation in any setting and it is applicable even when the methods available in literature fail or are of difficult application .",
    "indeed , most of those methods are based on the knowledge of the exact solution in the exterior of the computational domain or on a pointwise formulation of the radiation condition at infinity , which are not available  for instance  when @xmath6 is not constant at infinity .",
    "about the pml ( perfectly matched layer ) method , it is known that it can not be applied ( at least in a standard way ) when the index of refraction can not be continued analytically in the direction orthogonal to the artificial boundary ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate numerically how the numerical scheme depends on @xmath26 and @xmath32 and we will show some numerical examples which are of interest for the applications .    a relevant issue in this context is the study of the numerical algorithm at medium and high frequencies .",
    "when @xmath32 is large , the solution has a large amount of oscillations and the computational complexity of the problem increases .",
    "indeed , it is well known that , for frequencies in the mid and high regime , the number of unknowns in the finite element methods scales at least like the cube of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a typical dimension of the scatterer @xcite . in boundary integral methods",
    "the number of unknowns scales at least like the square of @xmath35 ; this growth can be sometimes reduced by using some a priori knowledge regarding the oscillatory nature of the solution ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .    from an analytic point of view ,",
    "an argument as the one in @xcite suggests that the convergence of the solution of - to the exact solution improves for @xmath32 large .",
    "since it is difficult to obtain an exact estimate of the rate of convergence , one of the goals of this paper is to test numerically the convergence of the algorithm for @xmath32 large .",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper ( for @xmath36 ) suggest that our approach gives consistent results at mid - high frequencies",
    ". however , since our approach has a large computational cost , we can not perform numerical simulations for @xmath32 very large ( in our tests , @xmath32 varies up to 96 ) .    in this paper",
    "we use a spectral collocation method to implement the numerical simulations and calculate the minimizer of .",
    "spectral methods are largely employed in problems where the solution is known to be analytic , and they usually provide a fast convergence of the numerical scheme . however , the solution of a typical scattering problem is expected to be no more than @xmath37 regular ( the coefficient @xmath6 may be just a @xmath38 function ) .",
    "the main reason for using a spectral method here is due to the _ global _ nature of the method . indeed , since we do not have to prescribe boundary conditions to the equation but we have to minimize an integral functional which is defined on the whole computational domain , the implementation by using a global method may reduce the computational complexity of the numerical scheme .",
    "we believe that , since the numerical studies presented in this paper will not make use of any approximation which could be used for @xmath32 large ( see for instance @xcite ) , the results presented in this paper are relevant in the case of mid - high frequency regime .",
    "the spectral approach will be used also to implement numerical simulations at low frequencies ( @xmath39 ) . in this case",
    ", it is expected that the error norms are worse as @xmath32 becomes smaller .",
    "this is confirmed by some numerical simulations presented in this paper . as we will show numerically , it is interesting to notice that this behavior does not appear for any choice of the source function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sect 2 ] we recall some analytical results and we conjecture the behavior of the numerical scheme for frequencies in the low , mid and high frequency regime .",
    "the study is presented in two dimensions but it can be extended to more dimensions . in section [ numeric_scheme ]",
    "we describe the numerical scheme and the spectral collocation method that we used . in section [ numerical_results ]",
    "we study the source problem - and present some numerical results that confirm our conjectures on the convergence rates .",
    "moreover , some numerical simulations for an angular dependent index of refraction are also shown . in section [",
    "sect 5 ] we show numerical simulations for some classical scattering problem .",
    "let @xmath9 be the solution of satisfying and denote by @xmath40 the ball of radius @xmath26 centered at the origin .",
    "let @xmath41 be the solution of the following minimization problem @xmath42:\\ w \\textmd { satifies } \\delta w + k^2 n(x)^2 w = f \\textmd { in } b_r\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is given by with @xmath25 . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it is proved that @xmath41 approximate @xmath9 in @xmath24 norm , more precisely that , for any fixed @xmath44 , we have that @xmath45 for @xmath32 fixed . as it was noticed in @xcite , there is an interesting interplay between the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath5 in . in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate and some aspects of its dependenc on these parameters .",
    "in particular , by using numerical results in the simplest case possible ( @xmath7 and @xmath47 ) , we are interested to study how the convergence in depends on the wavenumber @xmath32 .    in @xcite",
    ", it was noticed that the convergence is expected to worsen as @xmath32 becomes smaller ( see remark 3.1 in @xcite ) , that is @xmath48 it is not surprising that there is a behaviour like for @xmath32 small .",
    "indeed , when @xmath49 the helmholtz equation reduces to the laplace equation and ( or the sommerfeld radiation condition ) is not appropriate to guarantee that the scattering problem is well - posed .",
    "the first two goals of this paper are : ( i ) a deeper study of the rate of blow - up in and ( ii ) to understand if there are some sources for which there is no blow - up of @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "now , let us discuss the behavior of the minimization problem in the high - frequency regime .",
    "following remark 3.1 in @xcite , it is conjectured that the convergence improves for @xmath32 large : @xmath52 we do not know the exact rate of the convergence in : a deeper study of this issue is another goal of this paper .    to achieve this goal",
    ", it is needed to study the helmholtz equation numerically for large values of @xmath32 .",
    "due to the large number of oscillations , this is a nontrivial issue : it is known that the computational complexity needed to solve the helmholtz equation with some boundary condition ( and by using a finite element scheme ) grows as @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    ", the implementation of requires a larger computational effort . indeed ,",
    "since we have to minimize a volumetric integral functional subject to a linear constrain , by lagrange multipliers we have to deal with the inversion of a linear system which has a larger dimension and the computational complexity will increase at least as @xmath55 .",
    "for this reason , it is reasonable to use spectral methods to implement the numerical algorithm .",
    "indeed , a spectral method is a global method and it is expected that less points are needed to obtain the desired accuracy of the numerical algorithm , specially when the index of refraction and the source function are analytical times more than in the spectral collocation method ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 grid points , respectively ) . ] .",
    "we stress that the spectral method is still applicable when @xmath6 and @xmath5 are not continuous functions , which implies that the second derivatives of the solution may be discontinuous .",
    "however the solution will be at least of class @xmath58 and it is well known that spectral methods can be applied to solve the numerical problem ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we use a spectral fourier - chebyshev collocation method to implement the constrained optimization problem .[multiblock footnote omitted ]    we implement the minimization problem for @xmath59 in @xmath60 , a disk of radius @xmath26 centered at the origin which is parameterized in terms of the usual polar coordinates @xmath61 . to guarantee the well - posedness of the numerical scheme at @xmath62 , we follow @xcite and consider the symmetry conditions @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the @xmath61-space , which implies that we look at the solution in the _ extended _ domain @xmath65\\times(0,2\\pi]$ ] .",
    "we discretize @xmath66 by using a periodic fourier grid in the angular variable @xmath67 and fourier points @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 taken odd ) .",
    "we use a chebyshev grid in the radial variable @xmath71 with gauss - lobatto points @xmath72 , @xmath73 , so that @xmath62 is not included in the computational grid .",
    "we write the constraint in @xmath66 in polar coordinates @xmath74 and we discretize the laplacian by the well - known differential matrices for spectral collocation methods ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that , at any collocation grid points , we can construct differentiation formulas for the derivatives of @xmath9 in term of the values of @xmath9 itself at all collocation points .",

    "the contributions due to the lower blocks of the matrices @xmath91 are redundant , and therefore we neglect these contributions .",

    "the @xmath96 boundary values of @xmath9 in @xmath97 are the degrees of freedom of the problem and we do not need to evaluate @xmath5 at the boundary points . therefore the discretized helmholtz equation can be seen as an algebraic constrain of the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the @xmath100 matrix obtained by removing the first row of the matrix @xmath101 being @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 the identity matrix of order @xmath105 .",
