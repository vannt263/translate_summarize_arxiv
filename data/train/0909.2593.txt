    "in @xcite , lenstra generalized the notion of a euclidean domain to that of a dedekind domain @xmath0 with a euclidean ideal @xmath1 .",
    "he proved that if @xmath2 is a euclidean ideal then the class - group of @xmath0 is cyclic and generated by @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath3 , then his notion reduces to that of a euclidean domain and the above result reduces to the familiar fact that a euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain .",
    "building on work of weinberger ( @xcite ) , lenstra ( @xcite ) showed ( conditional of the generalized riemann hypothesis ) that any generator of the class group of the ring of integers in a number field with infinite unit group is euclidean .",
    "as the only number fields with finite unit group aside from @xmath4 , it is natural to inquire about the situation for quadratic imaginary fields .",
    "it is known that , among the nine quadratic imaginary fields of class number one , exactly five have euclidean integer rings and in each case the norm serves as a euclidean algorithm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend this result to the setting of euclidean ideal classes by determining all quadratic imaginary fields that have a euclidean ideal .",
    "we record them in the following theorem .",

    "norm_-euclidean ideals , then this result is contained in proposition 2.4 of @xcite .",
    "of course , as the results of weinberger and lenstra mentioned above conditionally demonstrate and examples of clark ( @xcite ) and harper ( @xcite ) unconditionally demonstrate ( in the class number one case ) , there are ideals in integer rings that are are euclidean but not with respect to the norm .    in the euclidean ring setting",
    ", a construction of motzkin ( @xcite ) has proven to be a fruitful tool in the study of euclidean rings that are not norm - euclidean . in her thesis",

    "let @xmath0 be a dedekind domain with fraction field @xmath7 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the set of fractional ideals of @xmath0 in @xmath7 that contain @xmath0 itself .",
    "recall from @xcite that @xmath2 is called _ euclidean _ if there exists a function @xmath9 such that for all @xmath10 and all @xmath11 , there exists @xmath12 such that @xmath13 in this case @xmath14 is called a _ euclidean algorithm _ for @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 is euclidean then it generates the class - group of @xmath0 . also ,",
    "if @xmath14 is a euclidean algorithm for @xmath2 then it is also a euclidean algorithm for any ideal in the same class as @xmath2 and no ideal in a different class than @xmath2 .",
    "these facts are all elementary and can be found in @xcite .",
    "the following definition , given in @xcite , is an adaptation of motzkin s construction to the euclidean ideal setting .",
    "[ hesterconstruction ] let @xmath2 be a non - zero ideal in @xmath0 .",
    "we define a nested sequence of subsets of @xmath8 as follows .",
    "set @xmath15 and for @xmath16 we set @xmath17 finally , set @xmath18 .",
    "when the ideal @xmath2 is fixed or otherwise clear from the context , we will often omit it from the notation and simply use @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the significance of this construction is the following lemma of the first author ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ lem1 ] the ideal @xmath2 is euclidean if and only if @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , one can say more .",
    "namely , if @xmath21 , then the function @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 if @xmath24 is a euclidean algorithm for @xmath2 and is minimal with respect to this property .",
    "the following two lemmas furnish constraints on the sets @xmath25 that will be useful in what follows .",
    "the first is general in nature and highlights the role of cyclicity of the class - group .",
    "[ lem2 ] if @xmath26 then @xmath27 = [ c^{-i}]$ ] .",
    "this is an immediate inductive consequence of definition [ hesterconstruction ] .    by definition ,",
    "any @xmath26 has the property that for all @xmath11 there exists @xmath12 such that @xmath28 .",
    "however , using the previous lemma and ideal class considerations , one can often cut down the set `` @xmath29 '' in this statement .",
    "when @xmath30 is finite , this observation is particularly useful because one can use it to efficiently bound the norm of a new element of @xmath19 , as the following lemma demonstrates .",
    "[ lem3 ] suppose that @xmath30 is finite , and suppose that @xmath31 is a subset with the property that , if @xmath32 then for all @xmath11 there exists @xmath12 such that @xmath33 then all @xmath34 have the property that @xmath35    for @xmath11 , the condition that there exists @xmath12 such that @xmath36 is a particular ideal depends only on the class of @xmath37 in @xmath38 .",
    "fix an ideal @xmath26 . for each non - zero class in @xmath38",
    "choose a representative @xmath11 and a @xmath12 such that @xmath39 .",
    "this collection of choices amounts to a ( decidedly non - canonical ) function @xmath40 suppose that two classes in @xmath41 map to the same ideal and let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be their chosen representatives",
    ". then there exist @xmath44 such that @xmath45 it follows that there exists a unit @xmath46 such that @xmath47 , and hence @xmath48 .",
    "that is , the classes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath38 differ ( multiplicatively ) by a unit .",
    "the upshot is that the set of nonzero classes in @xmath38 modulo the multiplicative action of @xmath30 injects into @xmath49 , and hence @xmath50 but since @xmath0 is dedekind , the left side is simply @xmath51 , so this is the desired inequality .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , @xmath7 will denote a quadratic imaginary field and @xmath52 its ring of integers .",
    "one approach to classifying the euclidean @xmath52 is to break into cases according to the factorizations of small rational primes in @xmath52 and use lemmas [ lem2 ] and [ lem3 ] of the previous section to glean consequences about the sets @xmath19 .",
    "if one uses the crutch of known lists of quadratic imaginary fields of small class number , then this approach _ nearly _ yields theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "indeed , aside from the known norm - euclidean cases detailed in this theorem , one finds in nearly all cases that the sequence of sets @xmath19 stabilizes very quickly ( one need nt ever consider ideals with prime factors of norm larger than 7 ) .",
    "the one vexing exception is the field @xmath53 .",
    "a bit of computation with sage ( @xcite ) reveals that the @xmath19 in this case contain at least the inverses of every ideal of norm up to @xmath54 .",
    "lacking the patience to continue this computation to its end ( and indeed the confidence that it had one ) , we decided to switch perspective .",
    "it is convenient to first dispense with the cases where @xmath55 is unusually large , namely @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these two fields are well - known to have norm - euclidean rings of integers , and for any other @xmath7 we have @xmath58 . from this point on we assume that @xmath7 is among the latter fields",
    ". it then follows from lemma [ lem3 ] that any @xmath59 has @xmath60 . as a result , by lemma [ lem2 ] , a euclidean ideal class in @xmath7",

    "fix an embedding of @xmath7 into @xmath63 .",
    "we will freely identify @xmath7 with its image in @xmath63 in what follows . under this embedding",
    ", the field norm corresponds to the square of the complex absolute value .",
    "note that a nonzero fractional ideal @xmath2 of @xmath7 is identified with a lattice in @xmath63 .",
    "consider the union of the open disks of radius @xmath64 centered about these lattice points .",
    "it is a simple consequence of the definition and the above comments that @xmath2 is norm - euclidean if these disks cover all of @xmath63 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the moral of the following result is that , if this covering fails too badly , then @xmath2 can not possibly be euclidean for _ any _ choice of algorithm .",
    "[ prop1 ] let @xmath7 and @xmath2 be as above , and let @xmath65 denote the union of the open disks of radius @xmath64 centered at the elements of @xmath2 .",

    "[ lemdense ] let @xmath7 be a quadratic imaginary field and let @xmath66 be any positive real number .",

    "viewing each fractional ideal @xmath74 as a lattice in @xmath63 , we see that disks of sufficiently large radius centered at the elements of @xmath2 will cover @xmath63 .",

    "arguing by contradiction , let us suppose that @xmath2 is euclidean for the algorithm @xmath9 , so by lemma [ lem1 ] , @xmath87 . since @xmath7 is dense in @xmath63 under its embedding , the complement of @xmath65 contains an @xmath88-neighborhood of an element @xmath68 for some @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 be as in lemma [ lemdense ] for this @xmath7 and @xmath89 .",

    ". by lemma [ lemdense ] , there exists @xmath92 such that @xmath93 it follows that @xmath37 lies in the complement of @xmath65 . since @xmath94 and @xmath95",

    "define @xmath97 and note that @xmath98 and @xmath99 . by the above ,",

    "because of this norm inequality , we again have @xmath101 and can repeat the argument with @xmath102 replaced by @xmath103 to obtain a fractional ideal @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "proceeding in this fashion , we obtain a sequence of ideals @xmath107 in @xmath8 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 but the latter is clearly impossible , as @xmath5 is well - ordered .",
    "we conclude that @xmath2 could not have been euclidean to begin with .    with the running restrictions on @xmath7 , we know that any euclidean ideal class is represented by a prime of norm @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "we are led by the above to examine the union @xmath65 as above for @xmath2 a degree one prime dividing @xmath61 or @xmath62 . in determining the extent to which @xmath65 covers @xmath63 ,",
    "it is clear that one need only consider a particular fundamental domain for @xmath2 in @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath110 for a square - free positive integer @xmath111 . in each of the following cases , we identify which @xmath111 correspond to the case , and for such @xmath111",
    "we draw a fundamental domain and the covering circles comprising @xmath65 that meet this fundamental domain .",
    "the pictures below are were generated with sage ( @xcite ) .",
    "as we will see , as @xmath111 increases , the fundamental domains we choose below get too tall to be covered entirely by these disks . in each case",
    ", we illustrate the fundamental domain and the disks comprising @xmath65 that meet it .",
    "we do this for the following @xmath111 in each class : those for which @xmath65 covers all of @xmath63 and the first @xmath111 for which it does not ( keeping in mind that we are only interested in square - free @xmath111 ) . for the latter @xmath111 , as we will see , it always happens that the complement of @xmath65 moreover contains an open set ( as opposed to having a nonempty but discrete complement ) , so proposition [ prop1 ] implies that @xmath2 is not euclidean .",
    "we note that in each case below , the given _",
    "ideal _ generators of @xmath2 are also generators of @xmath2 as an abelian group , as is easy to check .",
    "thus the parallelogram that they span forms the boundary of a fundamental domain , which is the one that we consider in each case .    since there is a degree one prime dividing @xmath61 , @xmath61 either ramifies or splits in @xmath7 , corresponding to the conditions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
