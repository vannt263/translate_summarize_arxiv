    "experimental determination of the strangeness form factors of the nucleons aims at the coupling of the @xmath1 boson to the strange quarks and measures the interference term between the @xmath2 and @xmath1 exchange interactions between electrons and protons in electron - nucleons scattering @xcite . if the nucleons have non - zero anapole moments , these contribute an axial current component to the electron - nucleon coupling , which has to be taken into account as a radiative correction in the extraction of the strangeness form factors from the measured asymmetry @xcite .",
    "anapole moments are induced by parity violating meson fluctuations of the nucleons , as e.g. @xmath3 fluctuations @xcite and @xmath4-loops with one parity violating ( pv ) vertex @xcite .",

    "an anapole moment this small does not affect the empirical extraction of the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton in pv electron scattering .",
    "a significant effect from the anapole moment would require that it be larger by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "a calculation of the anapole moment of the proton based on the chiral quark model is reported here .",
    "as the pseudoscalar and vector mesons couple directly to constituent quarks in this model , the anapole moment arises as a sum of contributions from pv meson loop fluctuations of the constituent quarks and pv meson exchange currents along with pv `` polarization currents '' induced by the pv meson exchange interaction between quarks .",
    "current conservation demands the presence of all of these combined .",
    "the calculation is therefore reminiscent of the calculation of nuclear anapole moments in refs .",
    "this provides an alternate approach to the baryonic loop calculations , which recently have been recast into the form of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the calculation based on the chiral quark model allows a unified treatment of baryon structure and the baryon spectrum based on the same hamiltonian .",
    "it takes all baryonic intermediate states into account , as the constituent quarks lack excited states .",
    "a major difference between the quark model and effective baryon field theory approaches is that while the @xmath16 aspect of the baryon wave function plays plays a major role in the former it plays none whatever in the latter .",
    "the magnetic moments of the baryons provide an example of a set of observables for which the 3-quark structure of the baryon wave function plays the leading role , and meson loops give but small contributions in the quark model .    in the chiral quark model the magnitude of the calculated anapole moment",
    "is determined by the pv meson - nucleon coupling constants . by taking into account both the pion and vector meson exchange contributions ,",
    "the value for the anapole moment of the proton is found to be @xmath17 , with a very large uncertainty margin , that mostly is set by the poorly known values of the pv meson - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "the pion contributions alone give rise to a positive value for the anapole moment ( @xmath18 ) , in agreement with results that are obtained in chiral perturbation theory @xcite . with",
    "the `` recommended '' values for the pv meson - nucleon coupling constants @xcite there are strong cancellations between the pion and vector meson contributions to the anapole moment .",
    "the pionic contribution to the anapole moment is found to be somewhat smaller in the chiral quark model than in the pion loop calculation at the baryon level @xcite because of a tendency to cancellation between the pion loop and pion exchange current contributions .",
