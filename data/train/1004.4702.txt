    "topological many body systems , characterized by exchanges of the particles unitarily rotating the wave function in the degenerate ground state subspace ( non - abelian statistics ) , are called non - abelian quantum systems .",

    "@xcite some key , albeit exotic , condensed matter systems , such as the pfaffian states in fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems  @xcite and chiral @xmath2-wave superconductors / superfluids ,  @xcite as well as the surface state of a 3d strong topological insulator ( ti ) ,  @xcite have been identified as non - abelian systems .",
    "recently , this list has been expanded by showing that even a regular semiconducting thin film ( _ e.g. _ , inas ) , proximate to an ordinary @xmath0-wave superconductor and a magnetic insulator , can support non - abelian excitations .",
    "@xcite since neither special materials nor exotic physics are needed to produce the non - abelian excitations , this structure is potentially one of the simplest to probe non - abelian quantum matter and therefore has attracted considerable attention in the recent literature . @xcite    the non - abelian excitations in the semiconductor in this proposal , are the zero - energy majorana fermions , defined by the self - hermitian operators @xmath3 , localized at vortices or the sample edges induced by the superconducting proximity effect . @xcite even though the non - abelian excitations in the @xmath1 fqh system are charged , the majorana excitations in the semiconductor are charge - neutral .",
    "the charge neutrality of the majorana excitations makes them unresponsive to an applied electric field and therefore difficult to detect experimentally . on the other hand ,",
    "electrically controlled edge state interferometry of the majorana excitations @xcite is a key experiment both to probe their exotic statistics as well as to implement tqc . @xcite",
    "recently it has been shown that on the surface of 3d ti ( in which the majorana excitations are also charge - neutral ) an interface between two domains with opposite directions of magnetization ( but no superconductivity ) supports gapless _ charged _ dirac fermionic modes .",
    "@xcite these charged modes can break up into two neutral majorana edge modes in the presence of superconductivity . since the charged fermion current can be controlled by external electric potentials ,",
    "this provides a way to electrically control the neutral current of the edge state majorana fermions in a ti , and thus to detect them .    for a semiconductor ,",
    "however , the above method does not work because there is no well - defined edge mode at the boundary between two domains with opposite directions of magnetization .",
    "this is because , unlike the ti surface , the system remains gapless even with non - zero magnetization in the absence of superconductivity.@xcite in the presence of superconductivity , however , all isolated chiral edge modes ( _ e.g_. , edges 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "1 ) that can be created in this system are majorana modes , hence charge - neutral . very recently a set of proposals @xcite atempt to avoid this problem by using the transport of majorana fermions in vortex cores of superconductors to create measurable interferometry of vortices in superconductors .",
    "the original proposals @xcite for such interferometry suffer from the possibly large vortex mass in superconducting systems making the observation of quantum interference in such proposals unlikely .",
    "the more recent proposals @xcite using josephson vortices instead of abrikosov vortices can possibly overcome the problem of a large vortex mass but might still face the problem of a very small minigap .",
    "therefore , electrically controlled edge state interferometry of majorana excitations remains a crucially important experiment to probe the non - abelian statistics of majorana fermions and implement tqc on @xmath4 spin - orbit coupled semiconductor systems .",
    "this is the problem we tackle in this work .    in this paper , we start with the existence of chiral majorana edge modes and majorana fermions shown in refs . [ ] and propose an interferometry experiment to demonstrate the non - abelian character of these charge neutral majorana fermions . to this end",
    "we first show that chiral majorana modes located at the isolated edges in the semiconductor ( edges 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "1 with the separation @xmath5 large ) are indeed charge - neutral . however , when the separation @xmath5 is on the order of the coherence length @xmath6 or smaller , the wave functions localized at the edges overlap and the resulting mode acquires charge . in the limit of zero separation between the edges , it is an interface separating regions with opposite directions of magnetization .",
    "we show by explicit calculations that even though such an interface can be thought of as created by superposing two originally charge - neutral majorana edge modes , it carries a chiral quasiparticle charge current which can be controlled by external bias voltages .",
    "the reason such a charge current can arise although the majorana modes themselves are neutral is , of course , the presence of superconductivity in some sense `` violates '' the naive charge conservation because of the spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry and the existence of phase coherent cooper pairs .",
    "recently , similar charged quasiparticle modes have been argued to exist at the domain walls of chiral @xmath2-wave superconductors .",

    "the proposed fractional josephon effect experiment @xcite would provide the sufficient condition , but direct interferometry , as proposed in the current work , is essential in establishing the non - abelian nature of the majorana particles .",
    "what we propose here is not by any means an easy experiment , but it is probably not much harder than the on - going interferometric measurements @xcite in the 5/2 fqhe state .",
    "we emphasize that only interferometry can directly establish the existence of non - abelian braiding statistics , and as such our proposed experiment is an important necessary step in the beautiful and exotic physics of emergent solid state non - abelian modes .",
    "our proposed interferometry experiments give clear cut signatures of the non - abelian statistics of the majorana modes localized in the order parameter defects on the semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "in addition to the zero - bias conductance peak experiments @xcite and the experiments measuring the fractional josephson effect @xcite due to majorana fermions , these experiments constitute another class of measurements directly testing the existence of non - abelian quasiparticles in the semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "moreover , the interferometry experiments , like their counterparts in the @xmath1 state and on the surface of a topological insulator , constitute the necessary first step in entanglement generation and implementation of tqc using the 2d semiconductor heterostructure .",

    "<S> such interferometry experiments on the semiconductor are analogous to similar interferometry experiments on the @xmath1 fractional quantum hall systems and on the surface of a 3d strong topological insulator , illustrating the usefulness of the 2d semiconductor heterostructure as a suitable tqc platform . in particular , we proposed majorana interferometers may be the most direct method for establishing non - abelian braiding statistics in topological superconductors . </S>"
