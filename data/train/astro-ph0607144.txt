    "intermediate - mass stars , with initial masses @xmath1 , are thought to contribute significantly to the synthesis of c , n , o , and ne through the cno cycle and he burning .",
    "these nuclear fusion products are ejected through mass loss as the stars evolve from their agb ( asymptotic giant branch ) phase into planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "hence , a pn can be regarded as a messenger bearing information on the nucleosynthesis within these stars . however , the optically - visible material in pne represents matter accumulated over the pn lifetime , making it difficult to extract information on , for instance , pure he - burning products just by observing the pne shells .",
    "soft x - rays , detected from several pne , are thought to originate in hot plasmas produced by shocks in fast stellar winds @xcite .",
    "these fast winds develop during the later evolutionary stages of the central star , so the x - rays are thought to be emitted by the star s late - phase products .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of pne will thus allow us to diagnose products of a particular nucleosynthesis phase inside intermediate - mass stars .",
    "however , it has been difficult to resolve k - lines from c , n , and o , the major cno and he - burning products , because the line energies were too low for x - ray ccds .",
    "in addition , these objects are often too x - ray faint for high - resolution spectroscopy using gratings , even when their angular size is small enough .",
    "the 5th japanese x - ray satellite _ suzaku _ ( _ astro - e2 _ ; mitsuda et al .",
    "2004 ) was developed by a japan - us collaboration as a successor to _ asca _ , and was launched successfully on 2005 july 10 .",
    "its x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) comprises four ccd cameras , xis-0 through xis-3 @xcite .",
    "three of the cameras use front - illuminated ( fi ) ccd chips while xis-1 utilizes the back - illuminated ( bi ) technology .",
    "compared to similar instruments on preceding x - ray missions , both the bi and fi chips have better responses to x - rays with energies below @xmath2 kev : their fwhm energy resolution at 0.5 kev is @xmath3 ev ( fi ) and @xmath4 ev ( bi ) , with insignificant low - energy tails .",
    "we observed the pn , bd  + 30@xmath0  3639 , with _",
    "suzaku _ in order to resolve the anticipated carbon and oxygen emission lines .",
    "since its detection using _ rosat _",
    "@xcite , this object has been known as the x - ray brightest pn , emitting spatially - extended soft x - rays from inside its @xmath5 diameter optical shell @xcite . the x - ray emitting plasma",
    "is thought to have highly non - solar abundance ratios , as shown by the strong ne - k line first detected using _",
    "@xcite , and a broad sub - kev spectral hump , presumably a blend of c , n , and o lines , subsequently detected with _",
    "chandra _ @xcite .",
    "the present observation of bd  + 30@xmath0  3639 was performed for a net exposure of 34.4 ksec on 2005 september 20 , ( ) , as part of the initial performance verification of _",
    "suzaku_. both the xis and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) onboard were operated in their nominal modes .",
    "we do not however use the hxd data , since its non - imaging @xmath6 field of view also contains part of the large supernova remnant , g65.2 + 5.7 , which overlaps with the target pn .",
    "the target was clearly detected in all xis cameras ; figure  [ szimage ] shows 0.30.7 kev images obtained with two of them .",
    "we define the source region as a @xmath7 radius circle centered on the source , which encloses @xmath8 of signal photons from the pn that is essentially a point source at the angular resolution of the _ suzaku _ x - ray telescopes .",
    "the background region is defined as a surrounding annulus with an outer radius of @xmath9 , as indicated in figure  [ szimage]a .",
    "after background subtraction , net signal counts are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 from xis-0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "since the three fi cameras ( xis-0 , 2 , 3 ) are essentially identical , we co - add their data , and refer to them as `` xis-023 '' below .",
    "as shown in figure [ x1spec ] , the on - source xis-1 spectrum clearly reveals at 0.37 kev the k@xmath14 line from hydrogenic carbon ( c  vi ) .",
    "its absence in the background spectrum ensures that the line is coming from the pn itself .",
    "the spectra also show k@xmath14 lines from o  vii , o  viii , and ne  ix .",
    "some of these lines are found in the background spectrum as well , but with much reduced intensities ; these background lines are thought to come from diffuse galactic soft x - ray components which may well extend to the present galactic latitude of @xmath15 , possibly with additional contribution from g65.2 + 5.7 .",
    "at a temperature of @xmath16 kev @xcite , the c  vi to o  vii ( the triplet summed ) line emissivity ratio of a solar - ratio plasma is @xmath17 . as illustrated in figure  [ x1spec ] in green ,",
    "this ratio will be reduced to @xmath18 @xcite due to interstellar plus intra - nebular absorption ( with the latter probably dominant ; @xcite ) , and the decrease in xis-1 efficiency toward lower energies .",
    "nevertheless , the xis-1 spectrum yields comparable numbers of c  vi and o  vii line photons , suggesting a highly enhanced c / o ratio of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "this early in the mission , the xis calibration is still being fine - tuned .",
    "there are uncertainties in the energy gain , and also in the low - energy efficiency which has decreased since the start of observations .",
    "we solved the former by self - calibrating ( within @xmath19 ) the gains using the emission lines from bd  + 30@xmath0  3639 themselves .",
    "the latter effect is attributed to excess absorption due to the build - up of contaminant in front of the xis cameras .",
    "we estimated the chemical composition of the excess absorber using a _ suzaku _ observation of the isolated neutron star rx  j1856.6 - 3574 @xcite , which is known to exhibit a blackbody with a temperature of 63 ev , absorbed by a low column of @xmath20 @xmath21 @xcite . to accurately determine the contaminant thickness for xis-1 and ( separately ) xis-023 , we included in all analysis a simultaneous fit to the archival ( ) background - subtracted _ chandra _ acis - s spectrum of the same object .",
    "we jointly fit the background - subtracted xis-1 , xis-023 , and _",
    "acis - s spectra , using an absorbed single - temperature vapec model @xcite .",
    "the abundances ( relative to solar ; @xcite ) of c , n , o , ne , and fe , were left free ; that of he fixed to solar ; other heavy elements were neglected ; @xmath22 and the intervening ( interstellar plus intra - nebular ) hydrogen column density @xmath23 were left free . as shown in figure [ combined - fit ] , the model gives a reasonable joint fit to the three spectra , with @xmath24 .",
    "we determined @xmath25 kev and @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ combined - fit ] also illustrates the difference in the energy - resolving power between the xis and acis - s .",
    "this fitting procedure can not in reality constrain the absolute ( i.e. , relative to hydrogen ) metal abundances , since the low - energy flux from a plasma with @xmath27 kev is dominated by emission lines from the metals themselves , even when the metallicity is @xmath2 solar .",
    "furthermore , the continua , due to hydrogen , ( presumably non - solar abundance ) helium , and the enhanced metals themselves , can not be independently determined .",
    "nevertheless , we expect abundance _ ratios _ among metals to be reasonably constrained by the lines which are individually resolved with the xis . to see this , we produced in figure  [ contour ] confidence contours for the c and o abundances using the joint vapec fits . thus , the contours are highly elongated along the proportionality between the two quantities , and the c / o ratio is successfully constrained as @xmath28 c / o @xmath29 solar at 90% confidence with the best estimate at 85 .",
    "( the range does not change significantly even allowing @xmath23 to float . ) in the same way , we have obtained @xmath30n / o @xmath31 and @xmath32 ne / o @xmath33 , with the best fits of 3.2 and 5.8 , respectively , and fe / o@xmath34 , all in solar units .",
    "below , these results are examined for various systematic effects .",
    "we have so far assumed the he / h ratio to be solar .",
    "however , increasing it to 5 , 10 , or 20 solar does not affect the relative c / n / o / ne abundances by more than 5% .",
    "similarly , the results remain unchanged within @xmath35% when the thickness of the xis excess absorber is varied by @xmath36% around the best estimates ( equivalent to @xmath37 @xmath21 ) , or the background spectra are derived from several other regions ( e.g. , using larger annuli or using limited azimuthal sectors ) in the xis field of view .    to relax the assumption of isothermality , we refitted the three spectra jointly with a sum of two vapec components , which are constrained to share common abundances and the same @xmath23 .",
    "we tentatively fixed the c / o ratio at various trial values , and let the two temperatures vary freely .",
    "even with this extra degree of freedom , acceptable fits were reproduced only when the assumed c / o ratio is in the range 35120 solar .",
    "the two temperatures were typically found at @xmath38 kev and @xmath39 kev .",
    "further , the c / o ratio stayed above @xmath40 even when fitted with a model allowing non - equilibrium ionization conditions .",
    "the largest systematic effect on our results comes from uncertainty in @xmath23 , because our best - fit value ( @xmath41 @xmath21 ) is twice that estimated from extinction data at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we therefore repeated the joint , single - vapec fit to the three spectra , but this time fixing @xmath23 at @xmath42 @xmath21 .",
    "then , @xmath22 increased to @xmath43 kev , and the c / o ratio decreased by a factor of @xmath44 , while the ne / o ratio remained nearly unchanged .",
    "these new parameters are consistent with the recent _ chandra _ letg results on bd  + 30@xmath0  3639 @xcite .",
    "however , the ( non - reduced ) @xmath45 for the joint fit to the _ suzaku _ xis and _ chandra _ acis data increases by @xmath46 when @xmath23 is forced to take the smaller value .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray absorption is actually higher than is implied by the extinction data , perhaps because the intra - nebular absorber is metal - enriched .",
    "based on these evaluations , we take as our result the original single - vapec solution ( i.e. , c / o @xmath47 ) with free @xmath23 , with the reservation that the c / o ratio could be subject to a systematic over - estimation by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "this factor reflects possible non - isothermality , non - equilibrium ionization conditions , or the uncertainty in @xmath23 . in any event",
    ", the very high carbon over - abundance relative to oxygen is a robust result , confirming the previous suggestions @xcite .",
    "the three spectra analyzed consistently indicate an absorbed 0.22.0 kev flux of @xmath48 erg s@xmath49 , in agreement with previous measurements @xcite .",
    "correction for the absorption by @xmath50 @xmath21 increases this flux by a factor of @xmath51 , yielding an absorption - corrected 0.22.0 kev luminosity of @xmath52 ergs s@xmath49 at a distance of 1.3 kpc @xcite .",
    "( if the fit with @xmath53 @xmath21 is used , the absorption - corrected quantities become smaller than these by a factor of @xmath44 . )",
    "this is only @xmath54 of the kinetic luminosity , @xmath55 ergs s@xmath49 , supplied by the fast stellar wind @xcite .",
    "this , together with the x - ray emitting region just fitting inside the optical shell @xcite , supports the interacting wind model @xcite as a scenario to explain the x - ray emission from this pn .",
    "observations in the optical and neighboring wavelengths give the nebular abundance ratios of bd  + 30@xmath0 3639 as c / o@xmath56 , n / o@xmath57 , and ne / o @xmath58 in solar units @xcite .",
    "compared with these , our x - ray results imply qualitatively similar , but much more extreme , abundance patterns .",
    "this is not surprising , since the x - ray emitting plasma is considered to represent a very limited radial zone of the stellar interior .",
    "in fact , assuming , based on the _ chandra _ image , that the x - ray emitting plasma fills a sphere of radius 0.01 pc ( @xmath59 ) , its mass is estimated as @xmath60 from the observed emission measure of @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "this can be supplied only in @xmath63 yr by the mass loss of @xmath64 yr@xmath49 from the central star @xcite .",
    "which part of the stellar interior provides the x - ray emitting plasma ?",
    "the most outstanding feature is the extreme carbon enhancement over oxygen , by a factor of @xmath3 in the _ number _ ratio , or @xmath40 in the _ mass _ ratio .",
    "this is a typical value expected from competition between the triple-@xmath65 and @xmath66c(@xmath67)@xmath68o reactions during he shell - burning flashes @xcite , for an initial mass of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we presume that the x - rays come primarily from products of he shell - burning episodes which took place in the agb phase",
    ". the possible factor - of - three uncertainty will not affect this inference significantly , since the theoretical calculations are thought to be uncertain to a similar degree .",
    "the observed high ne / o ratio , in contrast , requires a neon - producing path without @xmath68o .",
    "presumably @xmath70n , concentrated through the cno cycle , burnt as @xmath70n(@xmath67)@xmath71f(@xmath72)@xmath71o(@xmath67)@xmath73ne during the he shell flashes .",
    "this produces @xmath73ne , which is indistinguishable in x - rays from the more abundant @xmath74ne .",
    "finally , the hint of enhanced n / o ratio can be explained if some fraction of the nitrogen from the cno cycle , stored in the upper he layer , escaped without being caught up in the he shell burning .",
    "these considerations lead us to the following scenario for this pn .",
    "the hydrogen - rich envelope is likely to have already been expelled .",
    "the outer parts of the he layer , composed of radiative and convective zones , are currently being ejected in the form of fast stellar winds with a velocity of @xmath75 km s@xmath49 .",
    "the winds carry the abundant carbon and @xmath73ne produced in he shell flashes @xcite , as well as unprocessed nitrogen .",
    "these ejecta are shock - heated to emit x - rays .",
    "a more quantitative comparison with the optical spectra of the central stars of pne @xcite will provide a valuable calibration of the models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis .",
    "such work may also allow us to estimate the initial progenitor mass , and to clarify when the fast stellar winds start blowing . in closing , the present _ suzaku",
    "_ observation has provided a valuable opportunity of witnessing the carbon nucleosynthesis inside an evolved star , which is one of the central building blocks of the modern astronomy but has rarely been observed directly .",
