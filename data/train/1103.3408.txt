    "unitary and special unitary groups play an important role in various fields of physics .",
    "several problems that arise in the context of these groups require to express them in terms of a set of real parameters .",
    "in general , such parameterizations are not unique in the sense that the considered groups can be parameterized in many different ways . with regard to the diversity of problems it is reasonable to have a repertoire of different parameterizations available , in order to be able to choose the most convenient one for a given problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite we recently introduced the composite parameterization of the unitary group @xmath0 as an alternative to the canonical parameterization @xmath2 via hermitian matrices @xmath3 and those presented in refs .",
    "it was shown that our parameterization enables a simple identification of redundant parameters when it is applied to describing orthonormal bases , density matrices of arbitrary rank and subspaces . for all these objects we found representations containing the minimal number of parameters needed . due to its concise notation , simple implementation and computational benefits",
    "it has already found widespread applications in research on lattice correlation functions @xcite , quantum nonlocality @xcite , genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite and quantum secret sharing @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we adopt our concept that was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain a novel parameterization of the special unitary group @xmath1 .",
    "the need of additional representations of this group is not only apparent because of its vital relevance in all kinds of fields involving quantum physics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) , but moreover is given because the number of available parameterizations is relatively low compared to @xmath0 . here , our parameterization is proposed as an alternative to the canonical parameterization @xmath2 via _ traceless _ hermitian matrices @xmath3 and the generalized euler angle parameterization @xcite introduced by tilma and sudarshan .",
    "second , we rigorously derive the normalized haar measure in terms of the introduced parameters for both the unitary @xmath0 and the special unitary group @xmath1 of arbitrary dimension . in form of an infinitesimal volume element of a group",
    ", the haar measure contains all information about the distribution density in its parameter representation .",
    "this in return is essential for the capability of generating uniformly distributed random unitaries , density matrices and subspaces , as they are important in , for instance , monte carlo simulations @xcite or quantum data hiding @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions of the normalized haar measure can furthermore be useful to tackle group integrals as they appear in lattice qcd @xcite , quantum optics @xcite , stochastic processes @xcite and mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "in quantum information they can be found in the context of symmetric states ( _ werner _ and isotropic states @xcite ) and the _ a priori entanglement _ of quantum systems @xcite .    within recent years",
    "much attention has been paid to integrals over unitary groups , i.e. @xmath4 whose integrand is a polynomial in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it was shown that such integrals can be replaced by a sum of function values @xmath7 using a finite set of unitaries @xmath8 .",
    "such sets are termed _ unitary @xmath9-designs _ @xcite , wherein @xmath9 denotes that the degree of the polynomial in @xmath5 and @xmath6 is at most @xmath9 .",
    "whereas the existence of a unitary @xmath9-design was proven for all dimensions @xmath10 and all polynomial degrees @xmath9 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is generally unknown how to construct them for arbitrary @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , there currently exists no simple analytic method for solving any integral over any polynomial . due to this",
    ", there have been several attempts to find schemes to approximate unitary @xmath9-designs . here ,",
    "the usefulness of our results in the context of unitary @xmath9-designs and their approximations is obvious : since we do not only provide the haar measure but also the exact parameter ranges for group covering , the integration of polynomials can be performed explicitly and solved analytically in many cases .",
    "this in return allows to verify ( or falsify ) suggested unitary designs and to test the accuracy of approximations .",
    "apart from that , our tools for computing integrals are not limited to polynomials , but are applicable to arbitrary functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ compu ]",
    "we review the composite parameterization of the unitary group @xmath0 . in section [ compsu ]",
    "we introduce the composite parameterization of the special unitary group @xmath1 . in section [ haaru ] the general formula for the haar measure on @xmath0",
    "is stated and proven .",
    "an analogous formula for the haar measure on the special unitary group @xmath1 can be found in section [ haarsu ] .",
    "finally , in section [ notesint ] we make useful remarks on computing integrals over @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the composite parameterization and the associated haar measure .",
    "consider a @xmath10-dimensional @xmath11 complex hilbert space @xmath12 spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath13 . on this space",
    "define @xmath10 one - dimensional projectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 anti - symmetric matrices ] @xmath16 each acting on a two - dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in our previous paper @xcite , using these operators we have proven the following theorem :    [ theorem1 ] any operator of the unitary group @xmath0 can be written as ] @xmath19 \\cdot \\left [ \\prod_{l=1}^{d } \\exp(i p_l \\lambda_{l , l})\\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath20 real parameters @xmath21 in the ranges @xmath22 $ ] for @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] for @xmath25 .",
    "the idea behind this construction was to compose the unitary group out of ` elementary operations ' such as rotations and phase shifts . here",
    ", these operations are realized through the matrix exponential functions @xmath26 ( generates a rotation ) and @xmath27 ( shifts a phase ) . to make an ansatz for an arbitrary unitary operator it is useful to think of unitaries as orthonormal basis transformations . in this way ,",
    "the form ( [ uc ] ) can be interpreted as one option of incorporating @xmath10 global phase operations @xmath28 as well as @xmath29 rotations followed by relative phase shifts @xmath30 that result from partitioning the hilbert space into two - dimensional subspaces according to ( [ antisymm ] ) . that this @xmath20 parameter set of unitary operators indeed covers the whole unitary group @xmath0 was proven in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "this was done by showing that for any @xmath31 there exists a @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "unitary operators obeying @xmath34 constitute a subgroup of @xmath0 called the special unitary group @xmath1 .",
    "the first new result of this paper is that this group can be parameterized similarly as @xmath0 using the concept of the composite parameterization .",
    "first , let us note that as special unitary operators satisfy an additional constraint the special unitary group @xmath1 can be described by @xmath35 real parameters . as redundant parameters are undesirable we have to find a parameterization that contains exactly this number of parameters .",
    "second , it is known that @xmath36 is special unitary for all @xmath37 only if @xmath3 is hermitian and _ traceless_. in the composite parameterizaton of the unitary group @xmath0 we have used matrix exponentials of @xmath38 and @xmath39 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ projector ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ antisymm ] ) .",
    "the latter is already traceless but any one - dimensional projector @xmath38 has @xmath40 .",
    "as the projectors @xmath38 were used to create phase shifts it is clear that they have to be replaced by a set of diagonal _ traceless _ operators . for that we introduce the following operators @xmath41 these are possible generalizations of the diagonal pauli matrix @xmath42 acting on the subspace spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in ( [ distinc ] )",
    "the operation @xmath43 was used to generate a relative phase shift between the vector components @xmath17 and @xmath18 . however",
    ", the same effect can also be achieved with @xmath44 meaning that ( [ distinc ] ) can be replaced by @xmath45 it now remains to turn our attention to the last part of ( [ uc ] ) , i.e. @xmath46 $ ] . here ,",
    "each @xmath47 is regarded as a global phase operation on @xmath48 .",
    "special unitarity implies that there are only @xmath49 independent global phase operations instead of @xmath10 for @xmath0 .",
    "there is no unique way how these operations can be realized using matrix exponentials of ( [ genz ] ) .",
    "however , a possible and convenient choice is @xmath50 in this version , the first @xmath49 vectors @xmath51 experience the phase shifts + @xmath52 while the last vector @xmath53 gets phase shifted in the overall inverse direction , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "note that according to our labeling there is no parameter @xmath55 .",
    "thus , in total we have the desired number of @xmath35 parameters @xmath56 . in summary",
    ", this leads to the next theorem :    [ theorem2 ] any operator of the special unitary group @xmath1 can be written as @xmath57 \\cdot \\left [ \\prod_{l=1}^{d-1 } \\exp(i z_{l , d } \\lambda_{l , l})\\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath35 real parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 again run from @xmath60 to @xmath10 except that there is no @xmath55 .",

    "let @xmath67 be an arbitrary special unitary operator , i.e. @xmath5 fulfils @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the conjugate transpose of @xmath32 as given in ( [ suc ] ) using the abbreviation ( [ distincsu ] ) is @xmath70 \\cdot \\left[\\prod_{m=1}^{d-1 } \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{m }   \\lambda_{d - m , d+1-n}^{\\dagger }   \\right ) \\right ] \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the order of the factors in @xmath71 implies that @xmath72 acts first on @xmath5 . for @xmath73",
    "one obtains @xmath74 all other components remain unchanged , i.e. @xmath75 for @xmath76 if @xmath77 .",
    "we observe that @xmath78 can always be made zero using particular values for @xmath79 and @xmath80 : in case @xmath81 and @xmath82 both are zero , both parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be chosen freely . if only @xmath83 one chooses @xmath84 .",
    "if both are unequal zero then @xmath78 vanishes for @xmath85 this can always be achieved with @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "analogously , one can make the component @xmath88 of @xmath89 zero for the case @xmath77 . in this way",
    ", all components @xmath90 with @xmath91 of @xmath92 can be made zero .",
    "the unitarity constraints @xmath93 imply that also all @xmath90 with @xmath94 have become zero during this procedure .",
    "hence , @xmath95 is diagonal @xmath96 where @xmath97 are complex numbers of magnitude one , i.e. @xmath98 . the first @xmath49 phases @xmath99 can be compensated via @xmath100 \\overline{u}$ ] by choosing @xmath101 .",

    "recall that so far we have only multiplied special unitary operators implying that @xmath103 \\overline{u}$ ] is still a member of @xmath1 .",
    "we have achieved that @xmath104 is diagonal and that the first @xmath49 diagonal entries are all equal @xmath60 .",
    "now , the fact that @xmath105 still holds implies that also the last diagonal entry equals @xmath60 .",
    "hence , @xmath66 , which proves the theorem .",
    "it is worth mentioning some properties of the composite parameterization . in our previous paper @xcite on the parameterization of @xmath0",
    "we have shown that it can be rather insightful to gather the parameters @xmath56 in a matrix @xmath106 \\begin{array}{c } \\leftarrow \\mbox{rotations } \\\\ \\ \\\\ \\ \\end{array } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this notation the lower left entries represent relative phase shifts , the diagonal global phase shifts and the upper right rotations ( with respect to the computational basis @xmath13 ) . using this representation is particularly useful for illustrating which parameters are irrelevant for certain tasks .",
    "for instance , we have shown that for parameterizing an orthonormal set of @xmath107 vectors @xmath108 only the @xmath109 non - zero parameters of the following matrix are relevant @xmath110 \\begin{array}{c }    \\left .",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a similar example was given for parameterizing the set of @xmath107-dimensional subspaces in @xmath111 where the corresponding @xmath112 relevant parameters @xmath56 were illustrated .",
    "for the composite parameterization of the special unitary group @xmath1 all this remains valid as the operations ( [ distinc ] ) and ( [ distincsu ] ) are equivalent up to a global phase and are applied in the same order in both cases . using this matrix representation for the special unitary group one should only keep in mind that there is no diagonal element @xmath55 .",
    "let us illustrate another important feature of the composite parameterization .",
    "the @xmath113 or @xmath114 , respectively , non - zero parameters @xmath115 \\begin{array}{c }    \\left .",

    "this directly follows from the correct number of required parameters in combination with the fact that the subspace @xmath118 is independent of the illustrated parameters .",
    "note that this feature will be helpful in an upcoming proof .",
    "let us now assign an infinitesimal volume element @xmath119 to the unitary group @xmath0 in terms of the composite parameterization @xmath120 .",
    "this can be achieved by determining the associated haar measure .",
    "this means that , as for any compact lie group , we must find a measure of volume which is left and right invariant @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we require that @xmath119 satisfies @xmath121 for all @xmath122 . generally , an invariant measure is ( up to an irrelevant constant ) determined by the absolute value of the jacobian determinant @xmath123 wherein @xmath124 are coefficients of the unitary @xmath125 expanded in an orthogonal operator basis @xmath126 of @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 and where @xmath129 are any @xmath20 parameters that cover @xmath0 . here , a left or right translation @xmath122 merely induces a unitary basis transformation of @xmath126 which is length and angle preserving .",
    "hence , @xmath130 is invariant under these transformations and @xmath131 is a haar measure to the non - orthogonal coordinates @xmath129 the infinitesimal volume element transforms as @xmath132 according to the jacobian determinant . ] .",
    "our aim is to derive a general expression of @xmath119 for arbitrary @xmath10 in terms of the parameterization introduced in section [ compu ] , i.e. @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a normalization constant such that @xmath135 .",

    "one could in principle compute @xmath119 analogously for arbitrary @xmath10 , i.e. using the canonical operator basis @xmath146 and the naive order @xmath147 .",
    "for instance , a long and cumbersome computation reveals that @xmath148 demonstrating the validity of theorem [ theorem3 ] for @xmath149 .",
    "unfortunately , in this way , computing the determinant of the @xmath150 jacobian matrix becomes increasingly unfeasible the larger @xmath10 gets .",
    "more importantly , this approach is not suitable to prove a general expression such as ( [ haaru ] ) for all @xmath10 .",
    "however , the jacobian matrix can be considerably simplified by taking into account the invariance of the haar measure , the structure of the composite parameterization as well as the freedom in the choice of the operator basis and the order of the derivatives @xmath151 . in this way",

    "for instance , since all projectors @xmath158 commute , for any derivative with respect to a global phase transformation @xmath159 one obtains @xmath160 as can directly be inferred from the structure of @xmath32 ( [ uc ] ) , the derivatives @xmath161 are @xmath162 \\left[\\prod_{n = x+1}^{y } \\lambda_{x , n }   \\right ] iy_{x , y}\\left[\\prod_{n = y+1}^{d } \\lambda_{x , n }   \\right]\\left[\\prod_{m = x+1}^{d-1 } \\prod_{n = m+1}^{d } \\lambda_{m , n }    \\right ] \\prod_{l=1}^{d } \\exp(i p_l \\lambda_{l , l})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath163 , and @xmath164 \\left[\\prod_{n = y+1}^{x-1 } \\lambda_{y , n }   \\right ] ip_{x}\\left[\\prod_{n = x}^{d } \\lambda_{y , n }   \\right]\\left[\\prod_{m = y+1}^{d-1 } \\prod_{n = m+1}^{d } \\lambda_{m , n }    \\right ] \\prod_{l=1}^{d } \\exp(i p_l \\lambda_{l , l})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath165 .",
    "consequently , if we apply @xmath166 from the left , the products to the left of @xmath167 ( respectively @xmath168 ) cancel out and we get @xmath169 where @xmath170\\left[\\prod_{m = x+1}^{d-1 } \\prod_{n = m+1}^{d } \\lambda_{m , n }    \\right ] \\prod_{l = x}^{d } \\exp(i p_l \\lambda_{l , l } )   & \\mbox{for } \\",

    "this and the observation ( [ diagglobal ] ) imply that when we choose the following orthogonal operator basis and order @xmath177 the jacobian matrix becomes a lower block - triangular matrix +    ( 14,9)(0,0 ) ( 3,4.5 )    ( 0,0 ) [ ]    @xmath178    ( 5,0 )     + where all entries outside the grey - shaded blocks are zero .",

    "this can directly be followed from the construction of the composite parameterization in combination with the haar measure on @xmath220 and the jacobian matrix ( [ jacobianu2 ] ) . since in the jacobian matrix ( [ jacobianu2 ] ) and in its determinant",
    "the phase operations @xmath221 only appear as @xmath222 , i.e. complex numbers of magnitude 1 , and since in the end we are only interested in the absolute value of this determinant , it is clear that @xmath211 ( [ u2 ] ) is independent of these parameters .",
