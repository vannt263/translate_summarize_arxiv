    "the spectrum of electrons from the decay of a muon bound in an atom ( decay in orbit , dio ) has two parts .",
    "the low - energy part , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the electron energy and @xmath2 is the muon mass ) is present also in the free muon decay but is reshuffled because the bound muon is moving and the daughter electron interacts with the electric field of the nucleus .",
    "this modification of the spectrum was observed by twist @xcite .",
    "in addition , the possibility of transferring momentum to the nucleus approximately doubles the range of energy accessible to the electron , adding the high - energy region @xmath3 .",
    "this region has already been explored for some nuclei including titanium , sulfur and gold @xcite .",
    "upcoming experiments comet and mu2e @xcite will measure it for aluminum with a high precision .",
    "their main goal is to discover the lepton - flavor violating muon - electron conversion .",
    "high - energy electrons from the dio are a background in this search .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve the theoretical description of the entire spectrum by determining logarithmically enhanced radiative corrections .",
    "we focus on aluminum , the stopping material in comet and mu2e .",
    "the spectrum of the free muon decay is known including corrections of the first @xcite and of the second order @xcite in the fine structure constant @xmath4 , as well as the leading logarithms in the third order @xmath5 @xcite . in the case of the bound muon ,",
    "even @xmath6 effects are known only in a limited range of electron energies .",
    "radiative corrections near the top of the electron spectrum in the free muon decay ( @xmath7 ) were evaluated in @xcite by convoluting the @xmath6 free - muon spectrum with the so - called shape function @xcite , reconciling twist results @xcite with quantum electrodynamics .",
    "this approach had been developed in the heavy quark effective theory to describe decays of @xmath8-mesons @xcite using factorization theorems .",
    "alas , the factorization can not be applied when the electron energy is much larger than the half of the muon mass .",
    "fortunately , the highest energy endpoint of the dio spectrum ( @xmath9 ) offers a different simplification : one can expand in the number of photons exchanged with the nucleus , parameterized by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the proton number of the nucleus ( for aluminum , @xmath12 ) .",
    "radiative corrections in the endpoint region have been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "it is still unknown how to compute full radiative corrections for intermediate electron energies @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , the likely largest corrections can be computed .",
    "enhanced effects @xmath14 arise from collinear photons and can be found from collinear factorization theorems @xcite , without a new loop calculation .    in a muonic atom , vacuum polarization ( vp )",
    "is an additional source of large logarithms .",
    "it modifies the coulomb potential and is taken into account numerically together with the effects of the finite charge distribution in the nucleus . typically , the vp correction is on the order of @xmath15 , or @xmath16 near the dio endpoint .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] presents details of both collinear and vp corrections .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] summarizes numerical results . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we discuss the uncertainty due to the nuclear charge distribution and suggest a means of lowering it .",
    "we assume that the daughter electron is relativistic . for a low - energy electron",
    ", additional non - perturbative phenomena would have to be considered .",
    "for example , a slow electron can be captured into the atom in the final state .",
    "the low - energy part of the spectrum is not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "however , it involves only a small fraction of electrons because of the phase space suppression and it is not relevant for conversion experiments , sensitive only to the high - energy region of the spectrum .",
    "focusing on an energetic electron , we first consider the emission of collinear photons .",
    "for electron energies much larger than the electron mass @xmath17 , coulomb corrections are small and do not affect the collinear limit of the amplitude in the leading order in @xmath10 . before the emission of a collinear photon , the electron is almost on - shell and propagates over distances large compared with the size of the muonic atom .",
    "hence , the collinear emission is a long - distance phenomenon that takes place after the electron escapes the region of the strong binding potential . on the other hand , if the photon is emitted before the last scattering of an electron on the nucleus , the electron is still off - shell and the amplitude is not singular . in such case ,",
    "the corrections are not enhanced by a large logarithm @xmath18 or are suppressed by additional powers of @xmath19 . for aluminum , @xmath20 .",
    "these corrections are comparable with the non - logarithmic term @xmath21 and we neglect them .",
    "collinear corrections can be calculated using a factorization theorem , previously employed to improve the free muon spectrum @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we evaluate the collinear logarithms @xmath22 convoluting the leading order spectrum @xmath23 with the electron structure function , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the electron splitting function is @xmath26_{+}.\\ ] ] we employ the dimensionless variable @xmath27 with @xmath28 denoting the maximum electron energy .",
    "the convolution is defined as @xmath29 and the leading order term @xmath30 includes coulomb effects to all orders in @xmath19 .",
    "( [ eq : conv ] ) ensures a cancellation of the mass singularity in the correction to the bound muon lifetime , in agreement with the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem @xcite .",
    "the second type of large logarithms comes from the vacuum polarization that strengthens the binding .",
    "the vp does not contribute to the free muon spectrum at one loop , hence this correction is exclusive to the bound muon and related to other binding effects .",
    "the @xmath6 correction to the potential is known as the uehling term @xcite . for a pointlike nucleus",
    "the binding potential is    @xmath31    the vp potential for an arbitrary charge distribution is given in ref .",
    "the electron loop modifies the potential at distances comparable to the compton wavelength of electron @xmath32 or smaller .",
    "the vp term reduces the endpoint energy and increases the number of high - energy electrons .",
    "it also shrinks the muon orbit . as a result , the muon kinetic energy and the lifetime increase .    in muonic atoms ,",
    "the vp effect is much larger than in ordinary atoms @xcite .",
    "the binding energy , @xmath33 receives a correction that is not suppressed by extra powers of @xmath19 . in an ordinary atom",
    "the lamb shift contributes at the @xmath34 order .",
    "for example , the vp correction starts with @xmath35 .",
    "this behaviour follows from the range of the vp potential , much smaller than the size of the electron orbit @xmath36 when the electron is replaced by a muon , the potential reaches beyond the muon orbit , @xmath37 , and the correction to the binding energy behaves as @xmath38 . for a pointlike nucleus and using non - relativistic muon wave function , in the limit @xmath39",
    ", we get the correction to the binding energy @xmath40 this is larger than the total uncertainty in the binding energy and has to be included in the evaluation of the endpoint energy .",
    "we will return to this correction in the discussion of numerical results in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the logarithmic terms in the vp correction can also be reproduced by using in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eb ] ) the running coupling constant @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .    in the dio spectrum ,",
    "the vp effects do not factorize , unlike the collinear corrections .",
    "they are accounted for , together with the finite nuclear size , by numerically solving the dirac equation .",
    "large corrections with logarithms of @xmath19 are also present in the dio spectrum .",
    "pure relativistic corrections can contain @xmath43 , typically suppressed by two powers of @xmath19 @xcite . in our numerical approach , we solve the dirac equation without any non - relativistic expansion ; hence , these terms are automatically included in our leading order spectrum .",
    "logarithms of @xmath19 will appear also in radiative corrections involving ultra - soft photons , like in the classical calculation of the lamb shift @xcite .",
    "these bethe - type logarithms are suppressed by additional powers of @xmath19 , in the same manner as the vp shift of the binding energy in electron atoms .",

    "an analytical solution is not known for a realistic distribution of the nuclear charge density . in order to find the dio spectrum we have implemented in python matrix elements , including nuclear recoil corrections , given in @xcite . as a check of the numerical code ,",

    "we use the fermi model for the nuclear charge density distribution fitted to the electron elastic scattering data @xcite . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we discuss other possible models and the uncertainty related to the nuclear charge radius .    near the endpoint ,",
    "the spectrum rapidly varies with energy , like @xmath44 , so a precise value of @xmath28 is critical .",

    "also , we are not including the energy scale uncertainty in the fit .",
    "this reduces the number of fit parameters to one : the overall normalization of the spectrum .",
    "the quality of the fit is characterized by @xmath70 per degree of freedom , @xmath70/dof .",

    "the quality of the fit could likely be improved by including the twist systematic errors and correlations among energy bins but we are not qualified to do this .",
