    "if we consider the motion of a spinning particle in the gravitational field of a central body of mass @xmath7 and proper angular momentum j , it turns out that the spin s of the orbiting particle undergoes a tiny precessional motion @xcite . the most famous experiment devoted to the measurement , among other things , of such gravitomagnetic effect in the gravitational field of earth is the stanford university gp ",

    ".    if the whole orbit of a test particle in its geodesic motion around @xmath7 is considered as a sort of giant gyroscope , its orbital angular momentum  undergoes the lense  thirring precession , so that the longitude of the ascending node @xmath8 and the argument of pericentre @xmath9 of the orbit of the test particle are affected by tiny secular precessions @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the semimajor axis , the eccentricity and the inclination , respectively , of the orbit , @xmath15 is the speed of light and @xmath16 is the newtonian gravitational constant . up to now , the only attempts to detect the  effect on the orbit of test particles in the gravitational field of earth are due to ciufolini and coworkers @xcite who analysed the laser data of the existing lageos and lageos ii satellites over time spans of some years .",
    "the observable is a suitable combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes of lageos and lageos ii and the perigee , while @xmath17 .",

    "the quantity @xmath18 is the solved  for least square parameter which is 0 in newtonian mechanics and 1 in gtr .",
    "the lense - thirring signature , entirely adsorbed in the residuals of @xmath19 and @xmath20 because the gravitomagnetic force has been purposely set equal to zero in the force models , is a linear trend with a slope of 60.2 milliarcseconds per year ( mas yr@xmath21 in the following ) .",
    "the standard , statistical error is evaluated as 2@xmath0 .",
    "the claimed total accuracy , including various sources of systematic errors , is of the order of @xmath22 .",
    "the main sources of systematic errors in this experiment are    * the unavoidable aliasing effect due to the mismodelling in the classical secular precessions induced on @xmath8 and @xmath9 by the even zonal coefficients @xmath23 of the multipolar expansion of geopotential * the non  gravitational perturbations affecting especially the perigee of lageos ii @xcite . their impact on the proposed measurement is difficult to be reliably assessed @xcite    it turns out that the mismodelled classical precessions due to the first two even zonal harmonics of geopotential @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the most insidious source of error for the lense  thirring measurement with lageos and lageos ii .",
    "the combination is insensitive just to @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "according to the full covariance matrix of the egm96 gravity model @xcite , the error due to the remaining uncancelled even zonal harmonics amounts to almost 13@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , if the correlations among the even zonal harmonic coefficients are neglected and the variance matrix is used in a root  sum ",
    "square fashion , amounts to 46.6@xmath0 @xcite . with this estimate and the evaluations of @xcite for the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations the total error in the lageos",
    " lageos ii  experiment would be of the order of 50@xmath0 .",
    "if the sum of the absolute values of the individual errors is assumed , an upper bound of 83@xmath0 for the systematic error due to the even zonal harmonics of geopotential is obtained ; then , the total error in the lageos  lageos ii  experiment would become of the order of 100@xmath0 .",
    "this evaluations agree with those released in @xcite .",
    "the originally proposed lageos iii / lares mission @xcite consists of the launch of a lageos  type satellite  the lares  with the same orbit of lageos except for the inclination @xmath14 of its orbit , which should be supplementary to that of lageos , and the eccentricity @xmath26 , which should be one order of magnitude larger in order to perform other tests of post  newtonian gravity @xcite .",
    "the choice of the particular value of the inclination for lares is motivated by the fact that in this way , by using as observable the sum of the nodes of lageos and lares , it should be possible to cancel out to a very high level all the contributions of the even zonal harmonics of geopotential , which depends on @xmath27 , and add up the lense  thirring precessions which , instead , are independent of @xmath14 .",
    "the use of the nodes would allow to reduce greatly the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations to which such keplerian orbital elements are rather insensitive @xcite .    in @xcite an alternative observable based on the combination of the residuals of the nodes of lageos , lageos ii and lares and the perigee of lageos ii and lares has been proposed .",
    "it would allow to cancel out the first four even zonal harmonics so that the error due to the remaining even zonal harmonics of geopotential would be rather insensitive both to the unavoidable orbital injection errors in the lares inclination and to the correlations among the even zonal harmonic coefficients .",
    "it would amount to @xmath28@xmath6 only @xcite ( egm96 full covariance and variance rss calculations ) .    in regard to the present status of the lares project , unfortunately , up to now , although its very low cost with respect to other much more complex and expensive space  based missions , it has not yet been approved by any national space agency or scientific institution .",
    "from the previous considerations it could be argued that , in order to have a rather precise and reliable estimate of the total systematic error in the measurement of the lense  thirring effect with the existing lageos satellites it would be better to reduce the impact of geopotential in the error budget and/or discard the perigee of lageos ii which is very difficult to handle and is a relevant source of uncertainty due to its great sensitivity to many non  gravitational perturbations .",
    "the forthcoming more accurate earth gravity models from champ @xcite and , especially , grace @xcite will yield an opportunity to realize both these goals , at least to a certain extent . in order to evaluate quantitatively the opportunities offered by the new terrestrial gravity models we have preliminarily used the recently released eigen2 gravity model @xcite .    with regard to the combination",
    ", it turns out that the systematic error due to the even zonal harmonics of geopotential , according to the full covariance matrix of eigen2 up to degree @xmath29 , amounts to 7@xmath0 , while if the diagonal part only is adopted it becomes 9@xmath0 ( rss calculation ) . of course",
    ", even if the lageos and lageos ii data had been reprocessed with the eigen2 model , the problems posed by the correct evaluation of the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations on the perigee of lageos ii would still persist .",
    "a different approach could be followed by taking the drastic decision of canceling out only the first even zonal harmonic of geopotential by discarding at all the perigee of lageos ii .",
    "the hope is that the resulting gravitational error is reasonably small so to get a net gain in the error budget thanks to the fact that the nodes of lageos and lageos ii exhibit a very good behavior with respect to the non  gravitational perturbations .",
    "indeed , they are far less sensitive to their tricky features than the perigee of lageos ii .",
    "moreover , they can be easily and accurately measured , so that also the formal , statistical error should be reduced .",
    "a possible observable is ^l + c_1^l  ii~48.2_lt ,  c_1~0.546.according to the full covariance matrix of eigen2 up to degree @xmath29 , the systematic error due to the even zonal harmonics from @xmath30 to @xmath29 amounts to 8.5 mas yr@xmath21 yielding a 17.8@xmath0 percent error , while if the diagonal part only is adopted it becomes 22@xmath0 ( rss calculation ) .",
    "egm96 would not allow to adopt because its full covariance matrix up to degree @xmath29 yields an error of 47.8@xmath0 while the error according to its diagonal part only amounts even to 104@xmath0 ( rss calculation ) .",
    "note also that the combination preserves one of the most important features of the combination : indeed , it allows to cancel out the very insidious 18.6-year tidal perturbation which is a @xmath31 constituent with a period of 18.6 years due to the moon s node and nominal amplitudes of the order of 10@xmath32 mas on the nodes of lageos and lageos ii @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations on the combination over a time span of , say , 7 years can be quantified in just 0.1 mas yr@xmath21 , yielding a 0.3@xmath0 percent error .",
    "the results of table 2 and table 3 of @xcite have been used .",
    "it is also important to notice that , thanks to the fact that the periods of many gravitational and non  gravitational time ",
    "dependent perturbations acting on the nodes of the lageos satellites are rather short , a reanalysis of the lageos and lageos ii data over just a few years could be performed .",
    "this is not so for the combination because some of the gravitational @xcite and non ",
    "gravitational @xcite perturbations affecting the perigee of lageos ii have periods of many years . then , with a little time  consuming reanalysis of the nodes only of the existing lageos and lageos ii satellites with the eigen2 data it would at once be possible to obtain a more accurate and reliable measurement of the lense  thirring effect , avoiding the problem of the uncertainties related to the use of the perigee of lageos ii .",
    "very recently the first preliminary earth gravity models including some data from grace have been released ; among them the ggm01c model , which combines the center for space research ( csr ) teg4 model with data from grace , seems to be very promising .",
    "indeed , the error due to geopotential in the combination , evaluated by using the variance matrix only ( rss calculation ) , amounts to 2.2@xmath0 ( with an upper bound of 3.1@xmath0 obtained from the sum of the absolute values of the individual terms ) . instead , the combination would be affected at almost 14@xmath0 level ( rss calculation ) , with an upper bound of almost 18@xmath0 from the sum of the absolute values of the individual errors .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that extensive calibration tests have to be still performed for the ggm01c model .",
    "when more robust and complete terrestrial gravity models from champ and grace will be available in the near future the combination could hopefully allow for a measurement of the lense  thirring effect with a total systematic error , mainly due to geopotential , of some percent over a time span of a few years without the uncertainties related to the evaluation of the impact of the non  gravitational perturbations acting upon the perigee of lageos ii .",
    "on the other hand , the obtainable accuracy with the combination , whose error due to geopotential is smaller than that of , is strongly related to improvements in the evaluation of the non  gravitational part of the error budget and to the use of time spans of many years .",
