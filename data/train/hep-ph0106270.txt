    "it involves several quantum field theoretical issues such as phase coherence @xcite . in this talk",
    ", we will show some peculiarities coming from this sort of discussions , introduced in a quite conceptual manner and illustrated by several examples .",
    "in order to demonstrate several kinematics and coherence issues of a decay model , we choose majoron decay as an example @xcite .",

    "the decay may happen at @xmath6 , changing the direction of the secondary neutrino by an angle @xmath7.,height=113 ]    one can derive from the kinematics of majoron decay that the angle @xmath7 is limited by a maximum angle @xmath8 for @xmath9 decay @xmath10 the angle @xmath8 is determined by the @xmath11-dependence for a not too hierarchical mass spectrum .",

    "furthermore , we notice that especially for massive supernova neutrinos , the travel times on different paths may be different even for small angles @xmath8 . as we will see later , this will modify the time dependence of the signal at the detector .      in this section",
    ", we will study phase coherence in decay processes . especially , we are interested in the observability of interference effects with intermediate decays between production and detection .",
    "neutrino oscillations of decay products will be one example for such an interference effect .    neglecting the majoron field as well as the operators ,",
    "we know that to first order in the s - matrix expansion @xmath14 thus , the interaction destroys an @xmath15 state and creates an @xmath16 state by application of the appropriate annihilation and creation operators in the field expansions within the lagrangian .",

    "in other words , the wave packets of the different neutrino flavors do not sufficiently overlap because of the kinematics of the different leptons .",
    "thus , the feynman diagrams for different flavors need to be summed incoherently .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath21 decay , the produced neutrino - antineutrino pairs have small enough mass differences to allow wave packet overlaps of different flavor or mass eigenstates .",
    "this means that we need to sum the feynman diagrams coherently @xcite .    comparing @xmath21 decay to majoron decay ,",
    "we conclude that interference is not necessarily destroyed in neutrino decay .",
