    "complementing our gpi _ jh _ spectrum with the sinfoni _ k _ band spectrum presented in @xcite , we estimated the spectral type of hd  984  b from spectral templates constructed from a large number of near - infrared spectra of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs . to account for spectral covariances ,",

    "several photometric and spectral indicators were also computed to look for additional evidence of low surface gravity .",
    "none of these indicators suggested a low surface gravity for hd  984  b , and we therefore do not assign a gravity classification to the spectral type .",

    "as demonstrated for this object , substellar companions discovered in these campaigns can be rapidly characterized with an integral field spectrograph , and preliminary constraints on orbital parameters can be derived with a relatively short baseline between epochs . with the many ongoing surveys using extreme adaptive optics instruments such as gpi , sphere , and scexao ,",
