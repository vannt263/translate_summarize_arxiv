    "the sivers effect  @xcite was proposed originally to explain the large single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) observed in inclusive pion hadro - production ( @xmath5 ) at fnal  @xcite .",
    "the effect can be quantitatively described by a @xmath6-dependent distribution named as sivers function  @xcite @xmath7 , which is the distribution of unpolarized partons in a transversely polarized proton .",
    "it arises from a non - trivial correlation between the nucleon transverse spin and the intrinsic transverse momenta in the nucleon . despite its ( naively ) @xmath8-odd property  @xcite",
    ", sivers function has been proven to be non - vanishing  @xcite due to its special gauge - link property  @xcite .",
    "recently the ssa measured in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) processes with transversely polarized targets at hermes  @xcite and compass  @xcite , has been shown to be interpreted by the sivers effect .",
    "the asymmetry is identified by the angular dependence @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote respectively the azimuthal angles of the produced hadron and of the nucleon spin polarization , with respect to the lepton scattering plane .",
    "the coexistent collins asymmetry  @xcite , with a angular dependence @xmath12 , has also been measured in those experiments .",
    "the data on the sivers ssa has been utilized by different groups  @xcite to extract the sivers functions of the proton , especially those for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks , on the basis of the generalized factorization  @xcite .",
    "those sets of parametrization of the sivers functions are qualitatively in agreement  @xcite among themselves , and were applied to predict the sivers ssa in various processes in the established or planed facilities , such as the sidis at jlab , and the drell - yan process at compass , rhic and gsi .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the role of the sivers function on the transverse double spin asymmetry ( dsa ) in the drell - yan process .",
    "the transverse dsa has been investigated  @xcite for many years , and is believed to have advantage to unravel the transverse spin property of the nucleon  @xcite , especially the transversity distribution @xmath15  @xcite .",

    "we will show that through the appropriate weighting function @xmath19 , the asymmetry from the sivers function can be isolated without mixing with the contribution from other functions .",
    "using two sets of parameterizations  @xcite of the sivers functions we calculate the double spin asymmetry from the sivers functions in the @xmath20 drell - yan process at gsi .",
    "an asymmetry around 1 % is predicted .",
    "the asymmetries estimated from these two sets of sivers functions are quantitatively different .",
