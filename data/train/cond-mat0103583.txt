    "vulcanization   has a vast array of technological and commercial applications .",
    "the vulcanization process transforms a macromolecular liquid into an amorphous solid by randomly introducing permanent ( chemical ) crosslinks . in the liquid state",
    "all macromolecules are delocalized . in the amorphous solid state",
    "a non - zero fraction of macromolecules forms a macroscopic network .",
    "the constituents of this network are localized at random positions about which they execute thermal motion characterized by a distribution of finite localization lengths .",
    "the vulcanization transition ( vt ) between the two states ( occurring at a critical density of crosslinks ) represents a continuous phase transition .    due to the work of goldbart , zippelius , and coworkers ( gz )   a rather comprehensive theoretical description of the vt exists to date on the level of a mean field approximation .",
    "the mean field theory gave a first glance on the relation between the vt and the percolation transition , and the critical exponents describing the vt were shown to be consistent with the mean field critical exponents for percolation .",
    "et al_.   introduced a minimal model for the vt and discussed it under the aspects of universality as a common theoretical formulation of general amorphous solidification transitions ( of which the vt is a prime example ) .",
    "recently peng and goldbart ( pg )  @xcite carried out a renormalization group improved one - loop calculation based on the minimal model  .",
    "their calculation showed that the critical exponents of vulcanization and percolation are in conformity to one - loop level .    in the past",
    ", the vt has often been addressed directly from the perspective of percolation theories  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the work of gz this perspective takes into account only a single ensemble of random connections , and therefore does not incorporate the effects of both quenched randomness and thermal fluctuations .",
    "given that an essential aspect of the vt is the impact of the quenched random constraints on the thermal motion of the constituents , the a priori identification of the vt with percolation is a nontrivial matter and one may ask : what is the relevance of percolation theory to the vt ?    the purpose of this paper here is to explore the connection between vulcanization and percolation in depth . we compare the minimal model   to a field theoretic model for the random resistor network ( rrn ) which we recently studied  . such a rrn is nothing more than a percolation model where randomly occupied bonds are assigned a finite nonzero conductance .",
    "in contrast to pg , which implement a `` momentum shell '' renormalization group , we use the powerful methods of renormalized local field theory . the momentum shell procedure , although physically intuitive , mixes scaling properties with features of other universal quantities like scaling functions .",
    "therefore it is extremely difficult to extend the procedure beyond first order in perturbation theory .",
    "renormalized field theory goes the other direction . instead of the elimination of fluctuating degrees of freedom near the upper momentum cutoff and a rescaling of the momenta , the momentum cutoff is send to infinity at the beginning .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) infinities resulting from this limiting procedure are eliminated by the so called renormalization factors .",
    "these renormalization factors then determine the gell  mann - low renormalization group equation ( rge ) which encodes all the scaling properties of the theory .",
    "this rge represents the cleanest way to analyze the full scaling structure and its critical exponents .",
    "physical properties beyond the scaling structure , however , can not be inferred from the rge .",
    "indeed , these may be distinct for different theories like vulcanization and percolation .",
    "a further advantage of renormalized field theory is that it allows to find out general properties of the renormalization factors ( and hence the rge ) to all orders of perturbation theory because they result solely from so called superficially divergent feynman diagrams .",
    "our analysis presented in this paper thrives on this advantage .",
    "we show rigorously that vulcanization and percolation involve the same primitive divergences and hence are governed by the same critical exponents .",

    "now we turn to @xmath90 and assume that all featured liquid propagators are of the same color , @xmath82 for sake .",
    "since this color is distinguished , it is convenient to isolate it by setting @xmath115 with @xmath116 . then @xmath90 has the expansion @xmath117 .",
