    "recent data on the basic double - pionic fusion reactions @xmath7 and @xmath8 demonstrate that the so - called abc effect is tightly correlated with a narrow resonance structure in the total cross section of these reactions @xcite .",
    "the abc effect denoting a huge low - mass enhancement in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum is observed to occur , if the initial nucleons or light nuclei fuse to a bound final nuclear system and if the produced pion pair is isoscalar .",
    "the effect has been named after the initials of abashian , booth and crowe , who first observed it in the inclusive measurement of the @xmath10hex reaction more than fifty years ago @xcite .    the resonance structure with @xmath11 @xcite observed in the @xmath12 total cross section at @xmath13 2.38 gev",
    "is situated about 80 mev below @xmath14 , the peak position of the conventional @xmath15-channel @xmath16 process , which is also observed in this reaction .",
    "the resonance structure has a width of only 70 mev , which is about three times narrower than the conventional process . from the dalitz plot of the @xmath7 reaction",
    "it is concluded that this resonance nevertheless decays via the intermediate @xmath17 system ( at least predominantly ) into its final @xmath18 state . in the @xmath19 reaction",
    "the resonance has been sensed , too @xcite , though in this case there is no abc effect associated with the resonance . in consequence",
    "it has no longer be called abc resonance , but @xmath5  adopting the notation of the predicted so - called `` inevitable dibaryon '' @xcite with identical quantum numbers .    by subsequent",
    "quasifree polarized @xmath20 scattering measurements it has been demonstrated that there is a resonance pole in the coupled @xmath21 partial waves corresponding to the @xmath5 resonance structure in mass , width and quantum numbers @xcite  supporting thus its @xmath22-channel character .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then also the @xmath0 reaction should be affected by this resonance , since this channel may proceed via the same intermediate @xmath23 system as the @xmath24 and @xmath19 reactions do . from a simple isospin point of view",
    "we expect the resonance effect in the @xmath25 system to be identical in size to that in the @xmath18 system . and from more refined estimates in refs .",
    "@xcite , which account also for the different phase space situations , we expect the resonance effect in the @xmath25 channel to be about 85@xmath26 of that in the @xmath18 system .",
    "since the peak resonance cross section in the latter is 270 @xmath27b @xcite sitting upon some background due to conventional @xmath15-channel roper and @xmath16 excitations , we estimate the peak resonance contribution in the @xmath25 system to be in the order of 200 @xmath27b .",
    "since there exist no data at all for the @xmath0 channel , we have investigated this reaction experimentally with the wasa detector at cosy ( fz jlich ) by using a deuteron beam with an energy of @xmath2  =  2.27  gev impinging on a hydrogen pellet target @xcite . by exploiting the quasi - free scattering process @xmath28",
    ", we cover the full energy range of the conjectured resonance .",
    "in addition , the quasi - free process in inverse kinematics gives us the opportunity to detect also the fast spectator proton in the forward detector of wasa .",
    "the hardware trigger utilized in this analysis required at least two charged hits in the forward detector as well as two neutral hits in the central detector .",
    "the quasi - free reaction @xmath29 has been selected in the offline analysis by requiring two proton tracks in the forward detector as well as four photon hits in the central detector , which can be traced back to the decay of two @xmath30 particles .",
    "that way the non - measured neutron four - momentum could be reconstructed by a kinematic fit with three over - constraints .",
    "a difficulty emerges from deuterons , which originate from the @xmath31 reaction and which partly also break up while passing the detector . since in the @xmath32 energy loss plots used for particle identification proton and deuteron bands",
    "overlap somewhat , deuterons can not be separated completely from @xmath33 pairs stemming from the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "to suppress such misidentified events we require the angle between emitted neutron and proton to be larger than 5 degrees and also their energies to be in the expected range .",
    "nevertheless a monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation of the @xmath34 reaction , which is known in very detail @xcite , shows that we have to expect still a contamination of about 5@xmath26 in the spectra of the @xmath0 reaction . in figs . 1 - 6",
    "the observables are shown with the mc - generated contamination events already subtracted . in the @xmath35 invariant - mass spectrum @xmath36 , where the contamination shows up most pronounced , this concerns only the first two bins ( fig .  3 , bottom ) .    in fig .",
    "1 the measured and acceptance corrected spectator momentum distribution is shown in comparison with a monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation of the quasifree @xmath37 process . due to the beam - pipe ejectiles",
    "can only be detected in the wasa forward detector for lab angles larger than three degrees .",
    "the good agreement between data and simulation provides confidence that the data indeed reflect a quasifree process .",
    "the constraint for the suppression of breakup events ( see above ) causes the maximum accepted spectator momentum to be @xmath38 0.14 gev / c fulfilling the spectator momentum condition used in previous works @xcite this implies an energy range of 2.35 gev @xmath39 2.41 gev being covered due to the fermi motion of the nucleons in the deuteron .",
    "this energy range corresponds to incident lab energies of 1.07 gev @xmath40 1.23 gev .",
    "reaction within the wasa acceptance , which allows the detection of the spectator proton only for lab angles larger than three degrees .",
    "in addition the constraint for the suppression of breakup events has been applied ( see text ) .",
    "data are given by solid circles .",
    "the solid line shows the expected distribution for the quasifree process based on the cd bonn potential @xcite deuteron wavefunction . for comparison",
    "the dashed line gives the pure phase - space distribution as expected for a coherent reaction process . ]    in total a sample of about 24000 good events has been selected .",
    "the requirement that the two protons have to be in the angular range covered by the forward detector and that the gammas resulting from @xmath30 decay have to be in the angular range of the central detector reduces the overall acceptance to about 7@xmath26 . efficiency and acceptance corrections of the data",
    "have been performed by mc simulations of reaction process and detector setup . for the mc simulations model descriptions",
    "have been used , which will be discussed in the next chapter .",
    "since the acceptance is substantially below 100@xmath26 , the efficiency corrections are not fully model independent .",
    "the hatched grey histograms in figs .",
    "3 - 6 give an estimate for systematic uncertainties due to the use of different models with and without @xmath5 resonance hypothesis for the efficiency correction .",
    "the absolute normalization of the data has been performed by the simultaneous measurement of the quasi - free single pion production process @xmath41 and its comparison to previous bubble - chamber results for the @xmath42 reaction @xcite . that way the uncertainty in the absolute normalization of our data is essentially that of the previous @xmath43 data , _",
    "i.e. _ in the order of 20@xmath26 .",
    "in order to determine the energy dependence of the total cross section we have divided our data sample into 10 mev bins in @xmath3 . the resulting total cross sections together with their statistical and systematic uncertainties are listed in table 1 .",

    "they are compared to previous bubble - chamber measurements from kek ( open circles ) @xcite in case of the @xmath48 channel .    in case of the @xmath25 channel there",
    "exist no dedicated data from previous investigations",
    ". however , there are some connected data from the pinot experiment at saclay , where the inclusive reactions @xmath49 and @xmath50 were measured at @xmath51 = 1.3 and 1.5 gev @xcite . by excluding the two - photon invariant mass regions corresponding to single @xmath30 or @xmath52 production the remaining two - photon events populating the combinatorial background are likely to originate from @xmath53 production . by using this feature a measure of the ratio of the cross sections @xmath54 to @xmath47 has been obtained .",
    "this leads to a crude estimate for the @xmath55 cross section to be larger than the @xmath56 cross section by roughly a factor of two  in qualitative support of our results from the exclusive measurements @xcite .    [ t ]        in fig .",
    "2 we compare the data to theoretical calculations in the framework of the valencia model @xcite , which incorporates both non - resonant and resonant @xmath15-channel processes for two - pion production in @xmath57 collisions .",
    "the @xmath15-channel resonance processes of interest here concern first of all the excitation of the roper resonance and its subsequent decay either directly into the @xmath58 system or via the @xmath59 system as well as the excitation and decay of the @xmath16 system .",
    "deviating from the original valencia calculations @xcite the present calculations have been tuned to describe quantitatively the isovector two - pion production reactions @xmath60 @xcite , in particular the @xmath48 @xcite and @xmath61 @xcite channels by the following modifications :    * relativistic corrections for the @xmath62 propagator as given by ref .",

    "the latter modification was necessary , in order to account for the unexpectedly large @xmath67 cross section @xcite .",
    "the predictive power of these modifications has been demonstrated by its successful applications to the recent @xmath56 data at @xmath51 = 1.4 gev @xcite and to the @xmath19 reaction @xcite .",
    "final state interaction ( fsi ) in the emitted @xmath57 system has been taken into account in the migdal - watson @xcite factorized form .",
    "the @xmath57 fsi is by far strongest in the isovector @xmath68 @xmath35 state and less strong in @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath35 states as apparent from the scattering lengths in these systems . at energies above 1 gev",
    "the @xmath15-channel @xmath16 process is the dominating one .",
    "isospin decomposition of its contribution to the total @xmath0 cross section @xcite shows that in this process the @xmath68 final state is much less populated than the isoscalar @xmath70 state .",
    "the situation is somewhat different in the near - threshold region , where the roper excitation process dominates . in this process",
    "equal amounts of @xmath35 pairs are emitted in @xmath68 and @xmath70 states .",
    "since the modified valencia calculations have been tuned to the @xmath47 reaction , it is no surprise that its total cross section is fairly well described ",
    "2 , left . for the closely related @xmath71 reaction the calculations predict a similar energy dependence , but an absolute cross section , which is larger by roughly a factor of two  whereas the data are larger by more than an order of magnitude  see fig .",
    "2 , right .    as an independent check of these calculations we may perform an isospin decomposition of cross sections using the formulas given in refs . @xcite and the matrix elements deduced from the analysis of the @xmath69 induced two - pion production @xcite . as an result of such an exercise we get agreement with the modified valencia calculation within roughly 30@xmath26 .    as we see from fig .  2 ,",
    "the experimental cross sections obtained in this work for the @xmath0 reaction are three to four times larger than predicted .",
    "this failure points to an important reaction component not included in the @xmath15-channel treatment of two - pion production .",
    "it is intriguing that we deal here with the energy region , where the @xmath5 resonance has been observed both in @xmath33 scattering @xcite and in the isoscalar part of the double - pionic fusion to deuterium @xcite .",
    "also it has been shown that the description of the @xmath19 cross section improves greatly in this energy region , if this resonance is included @xcite .",
    "hence we add also here the amplitude of this resonance to the conventional amplitude . according to the predictions of fldt and wilkin @xcite as well as abaladejo and oset @xcite , its contribution at the resonance maximum should be about 200 @xmath27b ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 ) as discussed in the introduction .",
    "it is amazing , how well the resulting curve ( dash - dotted line in fig.2 ) describes the data .",
    "of course , it is a pity that there are no data outside the energy region covered by our data . in particular at energies below 1 gev and above 1.3 gev , _",
    "i.e. _ outside the resonance region , such data would be very helpful to examine experimentally the reliability of the predictions for the @xmath15-channel contributions .",
    "when binned into @xmath3 bins of 10 mev the different distributions do not exhibit any particular energy dependence in their shapes  which is of no surprise , since the energy region covered in this measurement is dominated by the @xmath5 resonance as evident from the discussion of the total cross section .",
    "hence we refrain from showing the differential distributions for single @xmath3 bins .",
    "we rather show them unbinned , _",

    "3 - 6 ) , but close to the predictions both with ( dashed and dash - dotted lines ) and without ( solid lines ) inclusion of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "the invariant mass spectra for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath82 ( figs . 4 - 5 ) are characterized by @xmath62 and @xmath83 dynamics as they naturally appear in the deexcitation process of an intermediate @xmath16 system created either by @xmath5 decay or via @xmath15-channel meson exchange .    the pion angular distribution ( fig .",
    "6 ) behaves as expected from the @xmath84-wave decay of the @xmath62 resonance . and",
    "also the proton angular distribution is similarly curved .",
    "both t - channel meson exchange and the @xmath85 requirement for @xmath5 formation predict comparable shapes in agreement with the data .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath72 spectra ( fig .",
    "3 ) need a more thorough discussion .",
    "the data of the @xmath72 spectrum appear to be quite well described by the calculations , which hardly deviate from each other . at small invariant masses",
    "though , in the range 0.3 - 0.4 gev / c@xmath86 , there is an indication of a small surplus of strength .",
    "taken the uncertainties inherent in the data and in the theoretical description , these deviations appear not to be particularly significant .",
    "therefore , if this constitutes a sign of the abc effect , then it is obviously very small in this reaction .",
    "note that contrary to the situation in the @xmath19 reaction , where the pion pair has to be in relative @xmath84-wave and hence the abc - effect is absent , the pion pair here is preferentially in relative @xmath22-wave allowing thus , in principle , the occurrence of the abc effect .",
    "hence , the finding that there is no or nearly no abc effect comes as a surprise at least for some of its interpretations .",
    "this finding is of no surprise , if the abc effect is described by a formfactor at the @xmath16 vertex of the @xmath5 decay @xcite .",
    "however , then a problem arises with the description of the @xmath36 spectrum , as we discuss in the following .    the @xmath36 spectrum peaks sharply at its low - mass threshold , which is characteristic for a strong @xmath33 fsi as discussed above .",
    "this low - mass peaking is well accounted for by the modified valencia calculations ( solid lines in figs .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath5 resonance as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dashed lines ) exaggerates the low - mass peaking deteriorating thus the agreement with the data .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the formfactor at the @xmath16 decay vertex of @xmath5 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the description of the abc effect , _",
    "i.e. _ the low - mass enhancement in the @xmath87 spectra observed in double - pionic fusion reactions .",
    "however , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this formfactor acts only on the @xmath72 and @xmath88 spectra , if the nucleon pair is bound in a final nuclear system .",
    "if this is not the case , then the formfactor acts predominantly on the invariant - mass spectrum of the nucleon pair .",
    "this is illustrated by comparison of the calculations including @xmath5 with ( dashed ) and without ( dash - dotted ) this formfactor .",
    "as we see , the formfactor hardly changes the @xmath72 distribution , but shuffles substantial strength in the @xmath36 spectrum to low masses  thus overshooting the observed low - mass enhancement .",
    "this finding indicates that the formfactor introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite on purely phenomenological grounds for the description of the abc effect is possibly at variance with the data for isoscalar two - pion production in non - fusion channels .",
    "hence alternative solutions for this phenomenon may have to be looked for , such as @xmath89-wave contributions in the intermediate @xmath16 system and/or final nucleon - pair @xcite .    another alternative involving @xmath89-waves has been proposed recently by platinova and kukulin @xcite . in their ansatz",
    "they assume the @xmath5 resonance not only to decay into the @xmath18 channel via the route @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being a @xmath92 state near the @xmath83 threshold , but since the pion emitted in the @xmath5 decay is in relative @xmath84-wave to @xmath93 , this route is practically indistinguishable from a @xmath94 decay at the given kinematic conditions ] but also via the route @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath96 is a spin zero object , it has to be in relative @xmath89-wave to the deuteron in this decay process , in order to satisfy the resonance condition of @xmath97 . in consequence the available momentum in this decay process",
    "is concentrated in the relative motion between @xmath89 and @xmath96 leaving thus only small relative momenta between the two emerging pions .",
    "therefore the @xmath72 distribution is expected to be peaked at low masses  _",
    "i.e. _ , the low - mass enhancement ( abc effect ) in this model is made by the @xmath98 decay branch ( in the amount of about 5@xmath26 ) and not by a formfactor as introduced in ref .",
    "the enhancement in this model is further increased by interference of the @xmath98 decay amplitude with the decay amplitude via the @xmath17 system .",
    "it appears straightforward to extend this ansatz also to reaction channels , where the @xmath33 system is unbound .",
    "however , since we hardly observe a low - mass enhancement ( abc effect ) in the @xmath72 spectrum , much less @xmath99 contribution is needed here than in the @xmath7 reaction  which possibly poses a consistency problem for this ansatz @xcite .",
    "another point of concern with this ansatz is that mass and width of the sigma meson have been fitted to the @xmath7 data in ref .",
    "@xcite with the result that @xmath100 300 mev and @xmath101 100 mev .",
    "both values are much smaller than the generally accepted values for the sigma meson @xcite , which are @xmath102 = ( 400 - 550 ) mev and @xmath103 = ( 400 - 700 ) mev . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that these deviations could be a sign of chiral restoration in the hadronic / nuclear environment - in particular within the six - quark bag .",
    "however , any evidence for this hypothesis from other experiments is lacking so far . whether the enhanced abc effect observed in the double - pionic fusion to @xmath104he @xcite is in support of such an argumentation",
    "is an open question .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction , for which no dedicated previous data exist , has been investigated by exclusive and kinematically complete measurements .",
    "they have been carried out in quasifree kinematics with a deuteron beam impinging on a hydrogen pellet target . utilizing the nucleons fermi motion in the deuteron projectile an energy region of 2.35 gev @xmath105",
    "2.41 gev could be covered corresponding to an incident lab energy range of 1.07 - 1.23 gev .",
    "this energy region covers the region of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "the data are in agreement with a resonance contribution of about 200 @xmath27b , as predicted by fldt and wilkin @xcite as well as by albaladejo and oset @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the differential data are reasonably well described by calculations , which include both the @xmath5 resonance and the conventional @xmath15-channel processes .",
    "the data indicate only a very small low - mass enhancement ( abc effect ) in the @xmath6-invariant mass distribution . though this not in disagreement with the phenomenological ansatz of a formfactor at the @xmath106 decay vertex introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the worsening of the description of the @xmath36 spectrum by use of this formfactor calls possibly for an improved explanation of the abc effect in connection with the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "after having found evidences for the @xmath5 resonance in the @xmath18 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 channels , the channel investigated here has been one of the two remaining two - pion production channels , where the predicted contributions of the @xmath5 resonance had not yet been checked experimentally .",
    "as we have shown now , the data for the @xmath25 channel are consistent with the @xmath5 hypothesis and provide an experimentally determined branching for the @xmath5 decay into this channel .",
    "since @xmath5 has been observed meanwhile also in the elastic channel by polarized @xmath20 scattering , the only remaining unexplored decay channel is @xmath109 .",
    "this channel has been measured recently at hades and preliminary results have been presented already at conferences @xcite .",
    "it will be highly interesting , not only to obtain total cross sections for this channel , but also differential distributions .",
    "of particular interest will be the @xmath36 and @xmath88 distributions as discussed in this work .",
