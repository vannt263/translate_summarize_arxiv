    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have been considered as the most likely power sources of the activity in quasars and active galactic nuclei ( lynden - bell 1969 ; rees 1984 ) .",
    "smbhs at the centers of all galaxies are now recognized as ubiquitous , whose mass @xmath0 is proportional to the spheroidal bulge mass of the host galaxy or the galactic bulge luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; richstone et al . 1998 ) and is strongly correlated with the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000a ; ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "recently , evidence for the existence of a smbh in the center of our galaxy has been added ( eckart & genzel 1997 ; genzel et al .",
    "1997 ; ghez et al .",
    "1998 ) . though searches for smbhs are primarily based on spatially resolved kinematics , another possible way to infer the presence of smbhs and to shed light on the physical condition is to examine spectral energy distribution over a wide range from the radio to the hard x - ray frequencies .",
    "this emission spectrum is produced by an accreting matter , as the surrounding gas accretes onto the central smbh ( e.g. , frank et al .",
    "1992 ; ho 1999 ) .",
    "several attempts have been made in utilizing this fact to estimate smbh masses ( yi & boughn 1998 , 1999 ; franceschini et al . 1998 ; lacy et al .",
    "2001 ; ho 2002 ; alonso - herrero et al . 2002 ; cao & jiang 2002 ) .",
    "it has been also suggested that advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) are responsible for the observed radio and x - ray luminosities of some of the x - ray bright galactic nuclei ( fabian & rees 1995 ; di matteo & fabian 1997 ; yi & boughn 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , yi & boughn ( 1999 ) discussed that the observed radio / x - ray luminosity relation in terms of the standard adaf model and demonstrated that it could be used as a relatively effective and consequently suitable tool to estimate unknown black hole masses . in this study",
    "we further explore this possibility both by increasing the number of data available and by deriving similar relations for the models with additional features , such as , truncations , winds , and investigate sensitivities of the method yi & boughn suggested on modifications of the standard adaf model .",
    "this paper begins with model descriptions for the standard adaf model and modified versions of the model in @xmath1 2 .",
    "we derive analytical expressions to describe the radio / x - ray luminosities for various models .",
    "we present the calculated ratios of the luminosities and compare them with the observational data in @xmath1 3 .",
    "we discuss and conclude in @xmath1 4 .",
    "when a mass accretion rate is below a critical rate , the radiative cooling becomes slower than the viscous heating . as a result of this ,",
    "the dissipated accretion energy is inefficiently radiated away and advected inward to the central object with the accreted matter , which is a key idea of adaf models ( see rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , b ) .",
    "detailed numerical calculations based on this idea have been performed , and the resulting spectra have been successfully applied to a number of extra galactic systems ( e.g. , narayan et al . 1995 ; lasota et al .",
    "1996 ; mahadevan et al . 1996 ; manmoto et al .",
    "1997 ; narayan et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "in this study we apply analytical scaling laws for self - similar solutions to derive the luminosity relation for adaf - variations ( narayan & yi 1994 ; mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt the following dimensionless variables : mass of the smbh @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the solar mass ; radius from the smbh @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ; and mass accretion rate @xmath6 , where @xmath7 when @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the flows are spherically symmetric as the adaf is quasi - spherical ( narayan & yi 1995a ) .",
    "however , the anisotropic extinction of host galaxies is not taken into account explicitly .",
    "this fact should be considered carefully if one wishes to elaborate this method .",
    "the advection fraction @xmath9 is determined such that the ion and electron energy balance equations are met .",
    "the quantities of interest are the volume - integrated quantities which are obtained by integrating the heating rate and cooling rates throughout the volume of the flows . for",
    "spherically symmetric flows the volume - integrated quantities are defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes any quantity of interest ( cf .",
    "mahadevan 1997 ) . as canonical values in a model for the adafs parameters",
    "are taken to be @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the inner and the outer boundaries of the disk , respectively , @xmath18 is the viscosity parameter , and @xmath19 is the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure .",
    "the results of this study are insensitive to these values unless these parameters are very small .",
    "the lower limit of the integration corresponds to the last stable orbit for the schwarzschild black hole , and the upper limit is not very crucial since most of radiation and heating occur around the central black hole .",
    "we assume that the electron temperature is constant for @xmath20 , as suggested by narayan & yi ( 1995b ) .      the total heating by the viscous dissipation for ions @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant defined as in mahadevan ( 1997 ) .",
    "we neglect the possibility of the viscous heating of the electrons , since we expect that the fraction of viscous energy transferred to the electrons is in the mass ratio of the electron to the ion , @xmath24 .",
    "the electrons are assumed to gain energy only by coulomb interactions with the ions .",
    "the total heating of the electrons due to the coulomb interaction is given by stepney & guilbert ( 1983 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 being a modified bessel function , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 being the boltzmann constant , the electron mass , and the speed of light , respectively , @xmath32 is a constant given in narayan & yi ( 1994 ) .",
    "the synchrotron photons are self - absorbed and give a blackbody radiation upto a critical frequency @xmath33 .",
    "for a given @xmath34 , the synchrotron spectrum @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the electron charge , the magnetic field strength , respectively .",
    "the radio luminosity @xmath44 at @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 .",
    "the highest radio frequency arises from the innermost radius of the accretion flows , @xmath47 ; @xmath48 . at this peak frequency",
    "the peak radio luminosity is given by @xmath49 we obtain the total power due to synchrotron radiation from @xmath50 we set @xmath51 , since @xmath52 is much smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "we neglect the comptonization of bremsstrahlung emission and consider the comptonization of synchrotron emission alone .",
    "a contribution by compton up - scattered synchrotron photons to the hard x - ray luminosity becomes important as @xmath57 increases , while bremsstrahlung emission dominates the hard x - ray luminosity when @xmath57 is substantially low .",
    "we approximate the comptonized spectrum by assuming that all the synchrotron photons to be comptonized have an initial frequency of @xmath53 .",
    "the maximum final frequency of the comptonized photon is @xmath58 , which corresponds to the average energy of the photon for saturated comptonization in the wien regime . on average",
    ", we assume that all the photons would see one half the total optical depth ( mahadevan 1997 ) , which is written as @xmath59 . the spectrum of the emerging photons at frequency @xmath45 has the power - law shape @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the initial luminosity at the initial frequency @xmath62 of the photons that are comptonized , @xmath63 , @xmath64 being the mean amplification factor in a single scattering .",
    "the total compton power is therefore given by @xmath65^{1-\\alpha_c}-1 \\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for given @xmath66 , the total heating of the electrons should be balanced to the sum of the individual cooling ; @xmath67 .",
    "the electron temperature is obtained by adjusting until this equality is satisfied .",
    "adafs have the positive bernoulli constant , which is a kind of total energy of the fluid , and , therefore , are susceptible to outflows ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "it might be the case that jets are present near the inner region of adafs .",
    "radio emission due to adafs at the high frequency will be suppressed if the inner part of the accretion flow is truncated by low frequency jets . in order to simulate this situation ,",
    "we truncate adafs at a certain inner radius .",
    "we suppose that the truncation occurs at @xmath68 .",
    "an observation of ngc 4486 ( m87 ) indicates that the jet is formed in a smaller radius than @xmath69 ( junor et al .",
    "this is also about where is the maximum radius that 15 ghz radio emission is generated for @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath71 can be estimated by @xmath72 .",
    "we consequently set @xmath16 in expressions in the previous subsection to @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 in corresponding expressions in the truncation case in order to obtain the radio luminosity and the x - ray luminosity .",
    "since the frequency at which the radio luminosity is the highest arises from the innermost radius of the accretion disk , @xmath75 , the truncation radius affects the peak radio luminosity at this frequency according to eq .",
    "in addition to a jet or outflows , since the gas in adaf solutions is generically unbound winds may also carry away infalling matter ( see , e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ; di matteo et al .",
    "1999 ; quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "we allow @xmath57 to vary with @xmath71 as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mass accretion rate at @xmath17 , @xmath78 is the parameter which controls the effects of winds ( see , e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "the mass loss causes a significant effect on a model spectrum for a large value of @xmath78 .",
    "bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emissions decrease with increasing @xmath78 , due both to the lower density and to the lower @xmath34 in inner parts .",
    "compton emission decreases with increasing @xmath78 even more strongly than the other two emissions since it depends both on @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "as @xmath57 is replaced by @xmath81 , expressions for the standard adafs are to be modified as described below .",
    "the total heating for ions @xmath21 reads @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",

    "values of @xmath78 considered correspond to the moderate wind case , and the strong wind case .",
    "the case of @xmath102 may represent the adafs where the convection is present in adafs in that the density scales @xmath103 with the radius instead of a power of @xmath104 ( narayan , igumenshchev , & abramowicz 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "for each curve , a constant @xmath57 for non - windy models or @xmath77 for windy models varies from @xmath105 ( upper left corner ) to @xmath106 ( lower right corner ) . a general trend of model predictions from the standard adaf , the truncated adaf , and the moderately windy adaf is somewhat similar and overlapped .",
    "as long as the canonical model parameters remain unchanged , however , the strongly windy adaf model with large @xmath78 , which represents the convection , results in quite different trends . besides the trend ,",
    "none of data points fall on the area defined by the convective adaf model predictions .",
    "the open circles denote the observed core radio luminosity at 15 ghz , and the filled circles the spatially resolved core radio luminosity which are converted from ones at 5 ghz to at 15 ghz using the @xmath107 power law ( cf . yi & boughn 1999 ) .",
    "we need such a conversion in order for a direct comparison of these luminosities at different frequency .",
    "sources generally fall into the region where theoretical curves predict .",
    "for instance , the mass of the central black hole in ngc 3377 is known as about @xmath108 ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . according to our theoretical predictions from the models except the strong wind adaf model",
    ", the mass of the central black hole in ngc 3377 falls in between @xmath109 to @xmath110 . apparently , even though the inherent radio / x - ray luminosity relation provides an estimate of the central smbh masses currently available , radio / x - ray flux relations are yet insufficiently accurate to give unambiguous estimates of the smbh mass . or , the observed radio / x - ray fluxes should be analyzed to extract disk components more carefully",
    ".    as for the sources which do not agree with the predictions very well , it is thought either because they have non - adaf sources in their centers or because the observed radio and/or x - ray flux is due to a non - adaf origin .",
    "the predicted mass of ngc 224 ( m31 ) is smaller than the estimated mass at least by two orders of magnitude .",
    "ngc 224 has a very low core radio luminosity , which is even lower than predicted with the mass accretion rate that the x - ray luminosity implies on the basis of an adaf model .",
    "ngc 224 seems to harbor a double nucleus ( lauer et al .",
    "1993 ; bacon et al .",
    "it is unclear whether adaf is viable under such circumstance .",
    "predicted masses of ngc 1068 , ngc 3031 ( m81 ) , ngc 3079 , ngc 4151 are @xmath111 to @xmath112 a few @xmath113 . on the other hand ,",
    "reported mass estimates of smbhs of these galaxies are less than @xmath114 .",
    "masses of these sources are thought to be over - estimated due to high radio / x - ray luminosities resulting from strong jet - related activities .",
    "moreover , uncertainties in x - ray flux measurements and intrinsic variations could cause errors in our predictions .",
    "ngc 1068 is famous in that it has a strong compact radio source , which results in a much higher radio / x - ray luminosity ratio than other seyferts ( gallimore et al .",
    "the radio core of ngc 3031 ( m81 ) is also highly variable on many timescale ( ho 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , ngc 3031 is substantially brighter in x - rays relative to the uv than in luminous agns ( ho 1999 ) , and its core luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band varies by a factor of @xmath115 in a timescale of years ( ishisaki et al .",
    "1996 ) . in ngc 3079",
    "the high radio luminosity may be due to an unresolved small - scale jet .",
    "the radio morphology of ngc 4151 suggests that the emitting material has been energized from the nucleus and that the jet interacts with the ambient medium ( carral et al .",
    "1990 ) .    in figure 2 ,",
    "the predicted core radio luminosity is shown as a function of the smbh mass in a logarithmic scale , with plots of smbh candidates whose mass estimates are publicly known . from top to bottom , for each pair of lines , the mass accretion rate corresponds to @xmath116 and @xmath105 .",
    "the line types and symbols are same as those in figure 1 .",
    "although the radio flux data are in high angular resolution there appears a somewhat wide range of radio luminosities , which is likely the result of small , and thus invisible , radio jets or other components of various frequencies rather than the pure adaf emission . in particular",
    ", the radio luminosity of objects such as ngc 3079 , ngc 3031 , and ngc 1068 seems too high to be explained by the pure adaf emission . in figure 3 ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity for the 2 - 10 kev band is shown as a function of the smbh mass in a similar way as in figure 2 .",
    "quoted x - ray fluxes of ngc 4486 and ngc 3377 should be considered as upper limits ( reynolds et al . 1999 ; pellegrini 1999 ) .",
    "note that the observed x - ray flux of ngc 3377 in the energy band of 0.2 - 4 kev is converted to the value in the energy band of 2 - 10 kev , assuming a power - law with the canonical spectral index for seyfert 1 galaxies , i.e. , @xmath117 .",
    "high resolution x - ray images have revealed discrete x - ray sources for ngc 224 ( trinchieri et al .",
    "1999 ) , ngc 3031 ( ishisaki et al .",
    "1996 ) , ngc 4736 ( roberts et al .",
    "for these sources we adopt core or bulge x - ray fluxes .",
    "one of important predictions of the adaf model is the radio / x - ray luminosity relation which can be used to estimate central smbh masses .",
    "we compute the theoretical predictions of the radio / x - ray luminosity relation for the adaf models with various modifications and compare the predicted relation with that from the available smbh candidates .",
    "several nearby extra galaxies have consistent ratios of radio to x - ray luminosities with the adaf predictions for an estimated mass of the central smbh .",
    "if the type of the accretion flow is provided by observations with a high angular resolution , the inherent radio / x - ray luminosity relation provides a direct estimate of the central smbh mass .",
    "we show the logarithm of the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosities against the logarithm of the x - ray luminosity for several smbh masses in figure 1 .",
    "the observations for several extra galactic objects are consistent with the predictions of adaf models , as can be checked in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that the model representing the adafs with the strong wind can be ruled out unless the microphysics in the standard adaf model has to be modified significantly .    in this study",
    ", we implicitly assume that all the smbhs are non - rotating .",
    "when the black hole rotates , the last stable circular orbit is no longer 3 @xmath118 .",
    "it becomes smaller than this value and eventually the event horizon when the black hole spin parameter @xmath119 .",
    "if this is the case the boundary condition should change as well as the dynamical properties of the flows in inner parts ( gammie & popham 1998 ; popham & gammie 1998 ) . besides dynamics of the flows , a rotating black hole may power a jet by the blandford - znajek process ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) . therefore , even if the black hole rotates slowly , the rotation should be properly taken into account in order to make this method robust .",
    "another crucial modification could be made in terms of microphysics we simplified .",
    "we have assumed that the viscously generated energy mainly heats the ions , heat exchanges between ions and electrons occur only due to the coulomb interaction , other physical processes , such as , mhd turbulence , pair production , are ignored .",
    "many works have been done to quantify the effects of such processes ( e.g. , zel et al .",
    "2000 ) . once clear understanding is incorporated in the method we present here , its implication can be more robust .",
    "on the other hand , at the moment , the peak luminosity of the radio is unlikely to be modified though the wings of the radio spectrum are modified by the nonthermal electrons .",
    "therefore , as long as we use the peak radio luminosity instead of whole structure , this method is not seriously defected .",

    "<S> optically thin and geometrically thick accretion flows are known to be responsible for the observed radio / x - ray luminosity relation of the x - ray bright galactic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been suggested that supermassive black hole masses can be estimated from measurements of the core radio luminosity and the x - ray luminosity by using the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we increase the number of data available by compiling the radio / x - ray fluxes and the mass in published literatures , and compare the observed ratio of the luminosities with predictions from various models of optically thin accretion flows . </S>",
    "<S> semi - analytically derived relations of the luminosities are presented in cases of the standard adaf model and modified adaf models , in which a truncation of inner parts of the flows and winds causing a reduction of the infalling matter are included . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed relation can be used indeed to estimate the supermassive black hole mass , provided that properties of such accretion flows are known . having investigated sensitivities of the method on modifications of the standard adaf model </S>",
    "<S> , we find that a general trend of model predictions from the standard adaf , the truncated adaf and the windy adaf are somewhat indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> we also find , however , that the extreme case of the windy model is inconsistent with currently available observational data , unless microphysics parameters are to be substantially changed . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution radio observations , however , are required to avoid the contamination of non - disk components , such as , a jet component , which , otherwise , results in the over - estimated smbh mass . </S>"
