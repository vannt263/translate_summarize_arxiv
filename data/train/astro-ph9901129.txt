    "there is abundant evidence that strong anisotropies play a major role in the observed characteristics of radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ; see antonucci 1993 and urry & padovani 1995 for a review ) .",
    "radio jets are in fact known to be strongly affected by relativistic beaming , while part of the optical emission in some classes of objects is likely to be absorbed by a thick disk or torus around the active nucleus .",
    "a unification of all high - power radio sources has been suggested ( barthel 1989 ; urry & padovani 1995 and references therein ) and according to this scheme , the lobe - dominated , steep - spectrum radio quasars ( ssrq ) and the core - dominated , flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) are believed to be increasingly aligned versions of fanaroff - riley type ii ( fr  ii ; fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxies . within this scheme , broad - line ( fwhm @xmath6 2000  ) radio galaxies ( blrg )",
    "have a still uncertain place .",
    "they could represent either objects intermediate between quasars and radio galaxies , ( i.e. , with the nucleus only partly obscured and the broad emission lines just becoming visible at the edge of the obscuring torus ) or low - redshift , low - power equivalent of quasars .",
    "the scenario described above makes a number of predictions about the x - ray emission of these radio - loud agn .",
    "moreover , the hard x - ray band , that is less affected by absorption , is essential for a complete knowledge of the intrinsic nature of these objects .",
    "although the x - ray spectrum can be very complex , the presence of a nuclear , likely beamed x - ray component in quasars is quite well established in particular for fsrq and blazars ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; shastri et  al . 1993 ; sambruna et al .",
    "there are mainly two arguments to support this : 1 ) the tendency for radio loud agn to have systematically flatter x - ray slopes than radio quiet ones ; 2 ) the fact that the soft x - ray slope decreases with core dominance ( shastri et  al . 1993 ) and increases with radio spectral index ( fiore et al .",
    "both these results are explained with the presence of a radio - linked synchrotron self - compton component of the x - ray emission that is likely to be beamed .",
    "this component would be dominant in the fsrq . in ssrq ,",
    "in which `` blazar - like '' , non - thermal emission is probably less important because of the larger angle w.r.t .",
    "the line of sight , the `` uv bump '' would be stronger ( as effectively observed : e.g. , wills et al . 1995 ) and the steeper soft x - ray component would represent its high - energy tail .    although a nuclear x - ray component has been detected also in radio galaxies , it appears to be much weaker than in radio quasars ( consistent with the idea that radio galaxies have an obscured nucleus ) .",
    "for example , the x - ray spectrum of cygnus  a ( ueno et  al . 1994 ) is consistent with a typical quasar spectrum absorbed by a high column density of cold gas along the line of sight . on the other hand , in the case of the broad - line radio galaxy 3c 390.3 ( inda et  al .",
    "1994 ) , its hard x - ray spectrum can be described by a relatively flat , unabsorbed power - law .",
    "this would suggest that blrg might well be the low - redshift counterpart of radio quasars and therefore aligned within @xmath7 ( as predicted by unified schemes : see e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .    from the above it",
    "is clear that a spectral x - ray study of lobe - dominated , broad - line radio sources ( including both ssrq and blrg ) , covering a large x - ray band is necessary for a number of reasons .",
    "namely : 1 ) to study the hard x - ray properties of lobe - dominated , broad - line radio sources , at present not well known ; 2 ) to investigate if the difference in the soft x - ray spectra of ssrq and fsrq apply also to the hard x - ray band . the detection of a flatter component in ssrq will be extremely important for our understanding of the emission processes in this class of objects ; 3 ) to increase the number of blrg for which the x - ray spectrum is known in detail in order to disentangle the real nature of blrg and investigate if the x - ray spectra of blrg and ssrq are similar .",
    "in this paper we present _ bepposax _ observations of five lobe - dominated , broad - line radio sources , namely three ssrq and two blrg ( we follow the commonly adopted definition of lobe - dominated source , which implies a value of the core dominance parameter @xmath8 ) .",
    "the sample is well defined ( i.e. , it is not a compilation of known hard x - ray sources ) and it is extracted from the 2-jy sample of radio sources for which a wealth of radio and optical information is available . the unique capability of the _ bepposax _ satellite ( boella et  al .",
    "1997a ) of performing simultaneous broad - band x - ray ( @xmath9 kev ) studies is particularly well suited for a detailed analysis of the x - ray energy spectrum of these sources .    in ",
    "2 we present our sample ,   3 discusses the observations and the data analysis , while   4 describes the results of our spectral fits to the _ bepposax _ data . in   5",
    "we also examine the rosat pspc data of our sources to better constrain the fits at low energies , in   6 we combine the analysis of the _ bepposax _ and rosat data while in   7 we briefly comment on the lack of iron lines in our spectra .",
    "finally ,   8 discusses our results and   9 summarizes our conclusions . throughout this paper spectral indices",
    "are written @xmath10 .",
    "the lobe - dominated , broad - line objects studied in this paper belong to a complete subsample of the 2  jy catalogue of radio sources ( wall & peacock 1985 ) .",
    "this subsample , defined by redshift @xmath11 and declination @xmath12 , includes 88 objects and is complete down to a flux density level of 2 jy at 2.7 ghz .",
    "optical spectra are available for all the sources together with accurate measurements of the [ o  iii]@xmath135007 , [ o  ii]@xmath133727 and h@xmath14 emission line fluxes ( tadhunter et  al . 1993 , 1998 ) .",
    "estimates of the core dominance parameter @xmath15 [ @xmath16 have been derived from both arcsec - resolution images and higher resolution data ( morganti et al .",

    "a study of the soft x - ray characteristics of the objects in the sample has been carried out using the rosat all - sky survey and/or rosat pspc pointed observations ( siebert et  al .",
    "1996 ) . for most of the objects ,",
    "however , no useful x - ray spectral information is available .",
    "the 2  jy subsample described above contains 16 lobe - dominated , broad - line objects ( excluding compact steep - spectrum sources , whose relation to other classes is still not clear ) . from those ,",
    "we have selected the 10 sources with estimated flux in the 0.1  10 kev band larger than @xmath17 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 for an x - ray spectral study with the _ bepposax _ satellite times more luminous in the x - ray band than the 6 sources which did not make the x - ray flux cut .",
    "our sample is then biased towards the most x - ray luminous lobe - dominated , broad - line sources in the 2-jy sample . ] .",
    "here we present the results obtained for the 5 objects so far observed in cycle 1 .",
    "the list of objects and their basic characteristics are given in table 1 , which presents the source name , position , redshift , optical magnitude @xmath20 , 2.7 ghz radio flux , radio spectral index @xmath21 ( taken from wall & peacock 1985 ) , core dominance parameter @xmath15 at 2.3 ghz , galactic  and classification .",

    "as can be seen from the table , the model parameters are extremely well determined .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath30 values are very similar to the rosat pspc energy indices , while the @xmath31 values are basically the same as the mecs ( plus lecs ) energy indices . the spectra are obviously concave , with @xmath32 and energy breaks around 1.5 kev ( pictor a has a break at about 4 kev but with a large error due to the relatively small difference between the soft and the hard spectral indices ) . the fact that the breaks fall at relatively low energies explain why the energy indices derived from the lecs fits are basically the same as those obtained from the combined lecs and mecs fits .    the addition of a thermal component in pictor a and pks 2152@xmath2569 improves significantly the fit ( @xmath33 level ) even in the case of a broken power - law model . as for the single power - law plus thermal component ,",
    "free  fits do not result in a significant improvement in the goodness of the fits , so galactic  is assumed .",

    "these are perfectly consistent with those obtained from the broken power - law fit to the _ bepposax _ and rosat pspc data and with the temperatures derived from the rosat pspc data , but the uncertainties are now poorly determined because of the relatively large number of parameters .",
    "a number of agn exhibit in their x - ray spectra iron k@xmath42 lines which are characteristic of relativistic effects in an accretion disk surrounding a central black hole ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "it appears that radio - loud agn have weaker iron lines than radio - quiet ones , although some low - luminosity , radio - loud sources are known to have strong iron lines ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we searched for fe k@xmath42 emission in our mecs spectra : none was found .",
    "the 90% upper limits on the equivalent width ( in the source rest frame ) of an unresolved iron line ( @xmath43 ) at energy 6.4 kev are the following : of @xmath44 : 380 ev ; pictor a : 150 ev ; om @xmath23 : 300 ev ; phl 1657 : 170 ev ; pks 2152@xmath2569 : 400 ev .",
    "note that for any broader line the limits are correspondingly higher .",
    "our result for pictor a is consistent with the upper limit of 100 ev given by eracleous & halpern ( 1998 ) based on a @xmath45 ks _ asca _ observation , and our limit for phl 1657 agrees with the upper limit of 140 ev given by williams et al . ( 1992 ) based on a 15 ks _ ginga _ observation .",
    "we note that the upper limits on iron lines in our sources are not very stringent and still consistent with values found in other lobe - dominated broad - lined sources ( e.g. , inda et al .",
    "1994 ; lawson & turner 1997 ; woniak et al .",
    "we have presented the first systematic , hard x - ray study of a well - defined sample of lobe - dominated , broad - line agn .",
    "our main result is that this class of objects has a hard x - ray spectrum with  @xmath46 at @xmath47 kev .",
    "in addition , we also detect a thermal emission component present at low energies in the spectra of two blrgs , but we find that this component contributes only @xmath48 of the total flux .",
    "hard x - ray emission is also present in core - dominated radio - loud quasars , and the detection of similarly flat spectra in our sample of lobe - dominated agn has important implications for our understanding of the relation between the two classes .    in order to make a more quantitative comparison between the hard x - ray spectra of the two classes we searched the literature for a study of core - dominated / flat - spectrum radio quasars similar to ours , i.e. , based on a well - defined , homogeneous sample .",
    "surprisingly , we found none .",
    "we then decided to collect all the information we could find on the @xmath3 kev spectra of fsrq , excluding objects with large ( @xmath49 ) uncertainties on the x - ray spectral index .",
    "the data come from _ ginga _ and exosat / me observations published in makino ( 1989 ) , ohashi et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1992 ) , lawson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , saxton et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , williams et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , sambruna et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and lawson & turner ( 1997 ; @xmath50 in the @xmath51 kev range ) .",
    "the resulting sample includes 15 objects and is characterized by @xmath52 , perfectly consistent with our results .",
    "we stress again that the sample of fsrq is heterogeneous whereas our sample , although relatively small , is well defined and has very well determined spectral indices .",
    "however , within the limits introduced by the biases likely present in the fsrq sample , lobe - dominated and core - dominated broad - line agn appear to have practically identical hard x - ray spectra in the @xmath53 kev region .    the objects in our sample are lobe dominated and therefore we investigated if inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons into the x - ray band by relativistic electrons in the diffuse radio lobes could be responsible for the observed x - ray emission ( see e.g. , harris & grindlay 1979 ; feigelson et al .",
    "we find that this is not the case and the derived x - ray emission is almost two orders of magnitude lower than observed .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that no strong resolved components have been found for our objects by rosat .",
    "the hotspot in pictor a is known to have associated x - ray emission but this is very weak and indeed only marginally detected by einstein ( rser & meisenheimer 1987 ; perley et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray component present in fsrq is usually interpreted as due to inverse compton emission , most likely due to a combination of synchrotron self - compton emission ( with the same population of relativistic electrons producing the synchrotron radiation and then scattering them to higher energies ) and comptonization of external radiation ( possibly emitted by material being accreted by the central object ; see e.g. , sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) .",
    "as the hard x - ray emission in our sources has a similar , flat slope , it seems natural to attribute it to the same emission mechanism .",
    "the smaller effect of doppler boosting for lobe dominated sources would then make this component to appear and become dominant only at high energies , and this is exactly what is shown by our data .",
    "this is further confirmed and clearly shown in figure 2 , where we plot the @xmath3 kev spectral index _ versus _ the core dominance parameter @xmath15 .",
    "( the open triangles indicate the ssrq and blrg found in the literature , in some of the papers listed above for fsrq ) .",
    "it is evident from the figure that no correlation is present between the two quantities .",
    "this seems in disagreement with the correlation claimed by lawson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ( based on exosat / me data ) and lawson & turner ( 1997 ) ( based on _ ginga _ data ) , the only previous hard x - ray studies which included some steep - spectrum radio quasars .",
    "we note that the spectral indices derived from exosat data had relatively large errors and that our sample of fsrq , ssrq and blrg is larger than the samples used by lawson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and lawson & turner ( 1997 ) ( 26 vs. 18 and 15 objects respectively ) especially as far as lobe - dominated broad - line sources are concerned ( where we have basically doubled the number of available sources ) .",
    "moreover , the correlation claimed by lawson & turner ( 1997 ) becomes significant only by excluding the three blrg in their sample ( the exclusion of the blrg has no effect on the lack of correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath15 in our sample ) .",
    "larger homogeneous samples ( especially of fsrq ) are clearly required in order to investigate this issue in more details .",
    "our hard x - ray spectra are well fitted by a single power law and we find no evidence for the hard excess often seen in low - luminosity agn ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) and interpreted as due to compton reflection of the x - rays off optically thick material ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ) . in the case of pictor",
    "a , this is also confirmed by the results of eracleous & halpern ( 1998 ) based on a longer _ asca _ observation .",
    "we note , however , that this reflection component should normally be apparent above @xmath54 kev and that our data reach these energies only for pictor a ( and even then with relatively small statistics ; see sect .",
    "[ sec : pds ] ) .",
    "woniak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have recently studied the x - ray ( and soft @xmath55-ray ) spectra of blrg using _ ginga _ , _ asca _ , osse and exosat data .",
    "their object list includes 4 lobe - dominated blrg , namely 3c 111 , 3c 382 , 3c 390.3 , and 3c 445 .",
    "the x - ray spectra have an energy index @xmath56 , with some moderate absorption .",
    "fe k@xmath42 lines have also been detected with typical equivalent widths @xmath57 ev .",
    "any compton reflection component is constrained to be weak and is unambiguously detected only in 3c 390.3 .",
    "our results are consistent with their findings .",
    "our mecs results for phl 1657 are in agreement with the _ ginga _ energy slope obtained by williams et al .",
    "( 1992 : see their table 3 ) , while our @xmath58 kev flux appears to be @xmath59 smaller .",
    "eracleous & halpern ( 1998 ) reported on a @xmath45 ks _ asca _ observations of pictor a. our lecs and mecs data appear to require a slightly flatter spectral index than given by these authors ( @xmath60 , from the sis and gis fits ) while our @xmath3 flux is similar to that derived from the sis ( but @xmath61 smaller than the @xmath3 kev flux estimated from the gis ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , various previous studies had found that ssrq displayed a steep soft x - ray spectrum ( see , e.g. , fiore et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , despite the hard component at higher energies , we nevertheless observe a steeper spectrum at lower energies . in the whole rosat band",
    "we find @xmath62 ( excluding om@xmath25161 , for which the rosat  has large uncertainties ) , which is intermediate between the values obtained for ssrq by fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) between @xmath63 kev ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 kev ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "our best fits to the whole @xmath0 kev range indeed _ require _ a spectral break @xmath67 between the soft and hard energy slopes at about @xmath5 kev .",
    "the dispersion in the energy indices is larger for the soft component .",
    "we find @xmath68 while @xmath69 , which might suggest a more homogeneous mechanism at higher energies .",
    "we note that fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also found a concave spectrum ( @xmath70 ) for radio - loud agn ( both flat- and steep - spectrum ) in the rosat band .",
    "there are some concerns ( r. mushotzky , private communication ) of miscalibration between rosat , on one side , and _ bepposax _ , _ asca _ and rxte on the other side , which could affect some of our conclusions .",
    "namely , the inferred rosat spectral indices might be steeper than those derived , in the same band , by other x - ray satellites ( a detailed comparison of simultaneous _",
    "asca_/rxte/_bepposax _ spectra of 3c 273 is given by yaqoob et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the spectral breaks we find in the spectra of our objects could then be partly due to this effect .",
    "this is clearly an important point , very relevant for x - ray astronomy , but which goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we can still comment on this as follows : 1 .",
    "the `` _ bepposax _ only '' spectrum of phl 1657 shows , by itself , significant evidence of a break , with best fit parameters consistent ( within the rather large errors ) with those obtained from the full rosat and _ bepposax _ fit ( see sect . [",
    "sec : lecsmecs ] ) . at least in this source ,",
    "then , the evidence for a spectral break is `` rosat independent . ''",
    "the fact that this is not the case for the two other objects with lecs data , pictor a and om@xmath25161 , can be explained by the relatively smaller break in the first object and the small lecs statistics in the latter . in other words ,",
    "the available evidence is _ consistent _ with breaks similar to those derived from the combined rosat and _ bepposax _ fits to be present also in the lecs / mecs data ; 2 .",
    "our main result , that is , the presence of a hard x - ray component in all our sources at @xmath71 kev , is based on _ bepposax _ data and therefore clearly independent of any possible rosat miscalibration",
    ".    one could also worry about possible miscalibrations between different x - ray instruments affecting the ( lack of ) correlation in fig .",
    "however , the results of woniak et al .",
    "( 1998 ) appear to exclude that possibility .",
    "the _ asca _ , _ ginga _ and exosat x - ray spectra of the sources studied by these authors , in fact , agree within the errors , particularly in the hard x - ray band . given the good cross - calibration between _",
    "bepposax _ and _ asca _ , a large miscalibration between _ bepposax _ , _ ginga _ and exosat ( the instruments used to obtain the data used in fig .",
    "2 ) seems to be ruled out .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper , which presents _ bepposax _ data for a well defined sample of 2-jy steep - spectrum radio quasars and broad - line radio galaxies can be summarized as below .",
    "all five lobe - dominated , broad - line sources included in this study have been clearly detected up to 10 kev ( 50 kev for pictor a ) and display a flat x - ray spectrum ( @xmath72 ) in the @xmath3 kev range .",
    "one source ( out of the three with lecs and mecs data , i.e. , reaching down to 0.1 kev ) shows significant evidence of a spectral break at @xmath73 kev .",
    "when rosat pspc data , available for all five sources , are included in the fit , the evidence for concave overall spectra , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 kev , becomes highly significant for all objects with good enough statistics at low energies ( i.e. , excluding om@xmath25161 ) .",
    "no iron lines are detected in our spectra but the upper limits we derive are not very stringent ( due to the relatively short exposure times ) .",
    "the flat high - energy slope we find for our lobe - dominated sources is consistent with the hard x - ray emission present in core - dominated radio quasars .",
    "in fact , by collecting data from the literature on the x - ray spectra of radio quasars , we show that the available data are consistent with _ no dependence _ between the @xmath3 kev spectral indices and the core - dominance parameter , somewhat in contrast with the situation at lower energies .",
    "finally , a thermal emission component is present at low energies in the spectra of the two broad - line radio galaxies , although only at the @xmath61 level .",
    "three more targets have been approved as part of this _ bepposax _ observing program ( one at a lower priority ) .",
    "we will be presenting results on these additional objects , and a more thorough discussion of the implications of our results in terms of emission processes , orientation , and more generally unified schemes in a future paper .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with alfonso cavaliere , andrea comastri , fabrizio fiore , paolo giommi , paola grandi , richard mushotzky , tahir yaqoob .",
    "we thank paola grandi also for her help with the analysis of the pds data of pictor a. this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",

    "<S> we present new _ bepposax _ lecs , mecs and pds observations of five lobe - dominated , broad - line active galactic nuclei selected from the 2-jy sample of southern radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> these include three radio quasars and two broad - line radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> rosat pspc data , available for all the objects , are also used to better constrain the spectral shape in the soft x - ray band . </S>",
    "<S> the collected data cover the energy range @xmath0 kev , reaching @xmath1 kev for one source ( pictor a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main result from the spectral fits is that _ all _ sources have a hard x - ray spectrum with energy index @xmath2 in the @xmath3 kev range . </S>",
    "<S> this is at variance with the situation at lower energies where these sources exhibit steeper spectra . </S>",
    "<S> spectral breaks @xmath4 at @xmath5 kev characterize in fact the overall x - ray spectra of our objects . </S>",
    "<S> the flat , high - energy slope is very similar to that displayed by flat - spectrum / core - dominated quasars , which suggests that the same emission mechanism ( most likely inverse compton ) produces the hard x - ray spectra in both classes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a ( weak ) thermal component is also present at low energies in the two broad - line radio galaxies included in our study .    </S>",
