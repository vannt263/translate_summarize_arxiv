    "the nature of the excited @xmath10 @xmath11 bound states above the @xmath12 threshold is of interest but still not well known . the @xmath13 resonance , as the lightest charmonium state lying above the open charm threshold , is generally assigned to be a dominant @xmath14 momentum eigenstate with a small @xmath15 admixture  @xcite .",
    "it has been thought almost entirely to decay to @xmath12 final states  @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , the bes collaboration found a large inclusive non-@xmath12 branching fraction , @xmath16 , by utilizing various methods  @xcite , neglecting interference effects , and assuming that only one @xmath13 resonance exists in the center - of - mass energy between 3.70 and 3.87  gev .",
    "a later work by the cleo collaboration , taking into account the interference between the resonance decays and continuum annihilation of @xmath17 , found a contradictory non-@xmath12 branching fraction , @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the bes results suggest substantial non-@xmath12 decays , although the cleo result finds otherwise . in the exclusive analyses ,",
    "the bes collaboration observed the first hadronic non-@xmath12 decay mode , @xmath19  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , and the decay to light hadrons @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "while experimentalists have been continuing to search for exclusive non-@xmath12 decays of the @xmath13 , the sum of the observed non-@xmath12 exclusive components still makes up less than 2% of all decays  @xcite , which motivates the search for other exclusive non-@xmath12 final states .",
    "the radiative transitions @xmath24 are supposed to be highly suppressed by selection rules , considering the @xmath13 is predominantly the @xmath14 state . however , due to the non - vanishing photon energy in the decay , higher multipoles beyond the leading one could contribute  @xcite .",
    "recently , authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the partial decay widths @xmath25  kev and @xmath26  kev ( with corresponding branching fractions @xmath27 and @xmath28 calculated with @xmath29  mev  @xcite ) by taking into consideration significant contributions from the intermediate meson loop ( iml ) mechanism , which is important for exclusive transitions , especially when the mass of the initial state is close to the open channel threshold .",
    "experimental measurements of the branching fractions @xmath30 will be very helpful for testing theoretical predictions and providing further constraints on the iml contributions .    in this paper , we present the results of searches for the radiative transitions @xmath24 . in order to avoid high combinatorial background and to get good resolution ,",
