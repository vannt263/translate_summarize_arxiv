    "experimental data on high energy physics say that elementary particles are complex systems with internal degrees of freedom .",
    "fundamental particle which in certain relation can pretend to simplicity , on the one hand , and underlie all known interactions , on the other hand , is the electron .",
    "nonexistence of the electron , being a source of electromagnetic field , in the maxwell theory and its generalizations is paradoxical .",
    "it may be explained by that the maxwell theory describes macroscopical averaged fields created by systems consisting of large quantity of moving charges .",
    "therefore the electron theory , whose foundations were laid by lorentz , is necessary for the description of the majority of the electromagnetic phenomena in material systems .",
    "the electron theory has been developing in classical trend after discovery of the electron by j.j.thomson in cathode rays .",
    "the theory by abraham  @xcite , based on the maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics , became the first theory considering internal structure of the electron . during two decades preceding experience by stern - gerlach and the kronig - uhlenbeck - goudsmit hypothesis about electron spin , there were appeared a few alternative theories and guesses about electron structure .",
    "it should be mentioned here works by compton  @xcite-  @xcite , influenced by both the paper by parson  @xcite and stereoscopic photos of tracks of the @xmath1-rays , made by wilson , some of which had almost ideal form of a helix .",
    "compton has come to a conclusion that the model of the electron , `` spinning like a tiny gyroscope '' , can eliminate difficulties in an explanation of curvature of these tracks , as well as of richardson - barnett effect and diffraction of x - rays by magnetic crystals . nevertheless , the parson - compton theory continuing early idea of vortex atoms , going back to greek atomists , kepler , descartes , leibnitz , svedenborg , boskovich , ampere , kelvin , and theories of some other researchers had rather natural philosophic and empirical nature , than they gave any mathematical instrument for future theory .",
    "the first mathematical realization of the parson - compton theory was the work by frenkel  @xcite , where the electron was considered as a point with six - vector of magnetic moment , what has allowed to explain the anomalous zeeman effect .",
    "after creation of quantum mechanics , especially after works by pauli and dirac , the electron theory began to develop chiefly in quantum direction . in 1930",
    "schrdinger has shown that the trembling motion ( zitterbewegung ) of the electron takes place in the dirac theory where eigenvalues of any component of the velocity operator are equal to @xmath2 .",
    "microscopic trembling motion with the velocity of light of imaginary center of the cloud of charge , whose amplitude is about half compton wave length , is imposed on translational macroscopic motion of the center of mass of the electron . as shrdinger talks , `` exclusively entangled relations , which are present according to the dirac equation already at free movement of a mass point ,",
    "seem to me worthy of enunciating though i can not present some completed result of this research ''  @xcite . in 1952",
    "huang has shown that zitterbewegung of a free dirac electron may be looked upon as a circular motion about the direction of the electron spin that in turn may be interpreted as the `` orbital angular momentum '' of this motion . as a result",
    "the electric current produced by zitterbewegung is seen to give rise to the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron  @xcite .",
    "however , as early as in 1937 mathisson has written down general relativistic equations of motion for systems possessed multipole momenta  @xcite .",
    "he has shewed also , that their application to a particle with spin treated as a dipole gives rise to equations of motion , describing zitterbewegung  @xcite .",
    "mathisson has considered the motion of a free uncharged particle with spin and free electron taking account of the reaction of radiation .",
    "here he has assumed spin to be a constant ( pseudo-)vector , what was rather stringent assumption , for spin direction in general can change .",
    "nevertheless , having associated trembling motion of the electron with the de broglie s wave , he has obtained the well - known value of a spin @xmath3 .    following basic articles by schrdinger and mathisson a lot of works",
    "were appeared , developing both quantum and classical electron theory and establishing connection between them .",
    "sufficiently full list of references one may find in the books  @xcite ,  @xcite . despite a considerable quantity of researches devoted to the theory of the electron",
    ", there are many unclear matters associated both with radiation of the electron and with dependence of its trajectory from its spin ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "an interest in classical theory of the electron has especially increased at the recent years , and this work contains some arguments in favour of a classical origin of zitterbewegung .",
    "relating of the electron spin with its proper rotation allows considering the electron as non - inertial object which can be described as a mass point with internal degrees of freedom  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the formalism of such description based on generalization of the second newton s law is considered in  2 . here",
    "the equations of motion of the point interacting with an external field described by the potential function depending on relative variables are obtained .",
    "consequence of the equation of motion is the equation of balance of energy which is integral of motion only if a certain condition is fulfilled .",
    "non - conservation of the energy , in general , seems to be caused by the fact that mass point in question is non - inertial system .",
    "it is supposed that internal degrees of freedom are described by the pseudo - vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 connected both with internal structure of the point , and with its interaction with external fields . it is shown in  3",
    "that equation of motion of free mass point reduces to a conservation of the velocity of the center of inertia . to obtain solutions natural equations of motion",
    "are introduced for internal degrees of freedom describing precession of pseudo - vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 round the direction of the velocity of the center of inertia .",
    "all solutions of the equation of motion for a free mass point ( when @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) in the center - of - inertia reference frame are found in  4 .",
    "the center of inertia proves to be does not coincide with the center of mass . as a result , the center of mass moves by a complicated trajectory round the direction of motion of the center of inertia .",
    "some solutions in the center - of - inertia reference frame are infinite .",
    "it is shown that they become finite at zero energy of the mass point .",
    "it is of interest that equation of motion admits also solutions for zero mass and transversal polarization . in  5 equation of moments",
    "is considered and speculations are contained about the physical sense of pseudo - vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 and their relation with spin whose equation of motion in general case we deal with in  6 , which contains also conclusive remarks on possible interpretation of obtained solutions .",
    "a mass point with internal degrees of freedom can be considered as a non - inertial system whose equation of motion taking into account its interaction with an external field has the form of the newton s second law (  @xcite-@xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 \\ ; , \\eqno{(2.2)}\\ ] ] is a dynamical momentum of the point , @xmath12 is its rest mass , @xmath13 \\ ; , \\eqno{(2.3)}\\ ] ] is a force , acting to the point .",
    "expressions ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) follow from the definition of the elementary work of force , @xmath14 , if potential function @xmath0 depends on velocity .",
    "potential function characterizes both medium in which the point moves and interaction of the point with physical objects which are in this medium .",
    "therefore it should be assumed that @xmath0 generally can depend on time @xmath15 , relative coordinates @xmath16 , velocity @xmath17 and accelerations @xmath18 , @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 .",
    "internal degrees of freedom are characterized by pseudo - vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 connected with both internal structure of mass point and interaction .",

    "<S> nonrelativistic formalism is developed , which allows describing systems with internal degrees of freedom in the scalar potential field @xmath0 , which is a function both on relative coordinates and time , and on relative speed and accelerations . </S>",
    "<S> the equation for energy , which is an integral of motion when @xmath0 satisfies to certain differential condition , is derived for the general case . for a free mass point </S>",
    "<S> all solutions of the equations of motion in the center - of - inertia reference frame , moving with constant velocity , are found . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the center of mass follows along helical and more complicated trajectories round a direction of motion of the center of inertia . </S>",
    "<S> this motion can be interpreted as trembling movement ( zitterbewegung ) . on this basis a conclusion is done that zitterbewegung has purely classical origin , arising even in a nonrelativistic case if internal degrees of freedom are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the general equation of motion for a spin which can be interpreted from positions of a classical mechanics is written down . </S>",
    "<S> application of the obtained results to the electron leads to new conception of electric charge , sign of which corresponds to a sign of spin polarization .    </S>",
