    "<S> water near hydrophobic surfaces is like that at a liquid - vapor interface , where fluctuations in water density are substantially enhanced compared to that in bulk water . here </S>",
    "<S> we use molecular simulations with specialized sampling techniques to show that water density fluctuations are similarly enhanced , even near hydrophobic surfaces of complex biomolecules , situating them at the edge of a dewetting transition . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , water near these surfaces is sensitive to subtle changes in surface conformation , topology , and chemistry , any of which can tip the balance towards or away from the wet state , and thus significantly alter biomolecular interactions and function . </S>",
    "<S> our work also resolves the long - standing puzzle of why some biological surfaces dewet and other seemingly similar surfaces do not .    </S>",
    "<S> much of biology happens in aqueous environments , with interfaces of biomolecules being wet  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> yet , hydrophobically driven assembly leads to contact surfaces that contain little or no water  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how biomolecules are able to perform the task of removing water from their vicinity is an important open question  @xcite . here , we show that the answer lies in the proximity of water near hydrophobic surfaces to an underlying phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamically , water at ambient conditions is already close to the liquid - vapor phase boundary . near a hydrophobic surface , </S>",
    "<S> water molecules are pulled away from the surface , because they interact only weakly with the surface , but have strong hydrogen bonding interactions with water in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> this further destabilizes water near hydrophobic surfaces and pushes it close to the edge of a dewetting transition . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , idealized repulsive hydrophobic surfaces nucleate a soft liquid - vapor like interface  @xcite . however , weak attractive van der waals forces exerted by realistic hydrophobic surfaces pull the soft interface closer , rewetting the surface , and masking the proximity to the underlying dewetting transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this proximity is then revealed not by the mean water density near the surface , but instead by fluctuations away from the mean  @xcite , and by the response of water density to perturbations  @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we employ specialized sampling techniques  @xcite to measure water density fluctuations near complex biomolecular surfaces , and show that they can be enhanced near a sufficiently hydrophobic patch . </S>",
    "<S> further , we demonstrate the sensitivity of water density to perturbations near such surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> it is by exploiting this sensitivity to perturbations , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , through subtle conformational changes , that biomolecules are able to dewet their surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this near - the - edge behavior can also be important in the function of certain biomolecules , such as in the vapor - lock gating of ion channels . </S>",
    "<S> our results also explain why the gap between two hydrophobic protein surfaces was found to be wet in one case  @xcite , and dry in another  @xcite : the two systems are close to , but on either side of the dewetting transition .    to illustrate that water density fluctuations provide a clear signature of hydrophobicity , we characterize them near self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) surfaces with -ch@xmath0 and -oh head groups , and in bulk water  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we calculate the probability distribution , @xmath1 , of observing @xmath2 water molecules in a volume , @xmath3 , of interest ( see supplementary information below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average number , @xmath4 , of water molecules in @xmath3 , reflected in the peak of @xmath1 , is similar in all three cases , indicating that both the -ch@xmath0 and the -oh sams are wet . </S>",
    "<S> the density fluctuations in bulk water and at the hydrophilic -oh sam are also similar and approximately gaussian ( parabolic on a log scale ) , as expected  @xcite . however , fluctuations near the hydrophobic -ch@xmath0 sam are different , with @xmath1 enhanced significantly for low @xmath2-values  @xcite . because the differences in the distributions at low @xmath2 correspond to fluctuations that are extremely rare , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath1 is very small , they do not affect the average equilibrium behavior . however </S>",
    "<S> , these rare fluctuations play an important role in the presence of a perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the response of water near the -ch@xmath0 and -oh surfaces to an unfavorable linear potential , @xmath5 , is very different . near the -oh surface , increasing @xmath6 shifts the distribution to the left  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) , and lowers the mean density of water , @xmath7 , gradually  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , near the -ch@xmath0 surface , even small @xmath6-values , of the order of the thermal energy ( @xmath8 ) , are sufficient to dramatically alter the distribution , with low-@xmath2 fluctuations being enhanced so much that they become the most probable ones ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , even a small perturbation is able to dry the hydrophobic -ch@xmath0 surface , and @xmath7 decreases precipitously  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the sensitivity of water density to perturbations , quantified by the susceptibility , @xmath9 , displays a peak near the hydrophobic surface ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1f ) ; a known feature of phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the remarkable sensitivity of water density to perturbations is directly connected to the enhanced low-@xmath2 fluctuations , with both observations resulting from the proximity of water to an underlying dewetting transition  @xcite .    to explore whether the principles governing the dewetting of hydrophobic interfaces illustrated above extend to the topologically and chemically complex surfaces of biomolecules , </S>",
    "<S> we study a subunit of the enzyme bphc , which includes a large hydrophobic patch at the boundary between its two domains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the protein surface is rugged ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) , which makes the calculation of @xmath1 in volumes that complement the protein surface challenging . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we developed an extension of the indirect umbrella sampling ( indus ) method  @xcite that enables the sampling of @xmath1 in arbitrarily shaped volumes . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b shows that @xmath1 near a hydrophilic patch is bulk - like , similar to that near the -oh sam . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , despite the presence of a highly polar backbone and possible interactions with charged side chains and counter - ions , @xmath1 near a hydrophobic patch on the isolated domain i surface shows enhanced low-@xmath2 fluctuations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c ) , similar to that demonstrated for the -ch@xmath0 sam .    to investigate how water near the hydrophobic patch responds to realistic perturbations , we place domain  ii near domain  i at different separations , @xmath10 , and calculate @xmath1 in the space between the two domains . as the domains are brought closer , while the likelihood of drying [ @xmath11 $ ] increases  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2d ) , the inter - domain region remains wet . </S>",
    "<S> even at @xmath12 nm , where only a single layer of water can be accommodated between the domains , the average value of @xmath2   [ peak of @xmath1 ] is high , consistent with the findings of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> berne : bphc . </S>",
    "<S> this might seem surprising given the prevalence of hydrophobic residues on the protein surfaces surrounding the inter - domain region . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath1 distributions at all @xmath10 display enhanced low-@xmath2 fluctuations , suggesting that water is at the edge of a dewetting transition , albeit on the wet side . </S>",
    "<S> if this is indeed the case , a sufficient additional perturbation should be able to push it over the edge and trigger dewetting . to test this , and motivated by zhou _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we turned off the partial charges on the protein , which is expected to be an unfavorable perturbation , and disfavor the presence of water . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the hydrophobicity of the patch on the isolated domain i surface is enhanced , as reflected in the enhanced fluctuations in fig .  2c . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this perturbation on water in the inter - domain region is dramatic : an essentially dry state is now preferred even at a distance of 0.6 nm between the domain surfaces ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2e ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the assembly of bphc domains , that of melittin dimers represents a system which sits on the dry side of the dewetting transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated @xmath1 near the putative hydrophobic face of an isolated dimer surface ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) , which indeed displays enhanced fluctuations  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , when the system is perturbed by placing a second wild - type dimer nearby , a drying transition in the space between the dimers is clearly seen in the @xmath1 distributions in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c . for @xmath14 nm , </S>",
    "<S> the average value of @xmath2 [ peak of @xmath1 ] is high , implying a wet state ; whereas for @xmath15 nm , the space between the dimers is dry . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for intermediate @xmath16 nm , the @xmath1 distributions show bimodal behavior , indicating the presence of a desolvation barrier separating the wet ( high @xmath2 ) and the dry ( low @xmath2 ) states . </S>",
    "<S> barriers along this simple order parameter , @xmath2 , can play an important role in governing the kinetics of dimer - dimer assembly .    although a drying transition is observed for the wild - type melittin dimers , once again </S>",
    "<S> , it is extremely sensitive to small perturbations , such as point mutations , as noted by berne and co - workers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated @xmath1 distributions near six isolated melittin dimer mutants , which all show enhanced fluctuations , with subtle differences between them ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) . to highlight the effect of a perturbation on the drying transition in melittin , we selected a point mutant , ile20gly ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are only subtle differences in the @xmath1 distributions near the isolated wild - type and the mutant dimer  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , they translate into dramatic differences in confinement , where the system is poised at the edge of a dewetting transition . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the ile20gly mutant no longer displays a drying transition , as the average value of @xmath2 remains high even at the smallest @xmath10  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the data in figs .  2 and 3 underscore that both bphc and melittin sit near the edge of a wetting - dewetting transition , one on the wet and the other on the dry side , and each can be pushed to the other side by a small perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> this proximity to the phase transition is not evident in the mean behavior of water , but is revealed by water density fluctuations .    to enable regulation , biological systems </S>",
    "<S> are generically thought to position themselves near phase transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our application of specialized techniques that measure rare fluctuations allowed us to highlight that water near hydrophobic surfaces of biomolecules is similarly situated at the edge of a dewetting transition , and is sensitive to small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity provides biomolecules with the powerful ability to tune their interactions and function by manipulating the local context , for example , by confining water between them , or by changing their shape or chemistry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given that desolvation is a component of the reaction coordinate for hydrophobically driven assembly  @xcite , manipulating wetting - dewetting may appreciably influence the kinetics of assembly . </S>",
    "<S> dewetting transitions are also central in the function of some ion channels ( _ e.g. _ , mechano sensitive channel mscs ) , where a 10 - 20    long interior hydrophobic wall of the channel provides gating by the  vapor lock \" mechanism  a wet channel conducts ions rapidly ; whereas , a small conformational change can dry the channel and stop ion conduction completely  @xcite . dewetting </S>",
    "<S> can also be induced by manipulating solution conditions ( _ e.g. _ , temperature , pressure , ph , and co - solvent or solute concentration )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the sensitivity of nanoscale dewetting transitions is also responsible for the spontaneous filling and emptying of hydrophobic nanotubes  @xcite , and can be harnessed in various other non- biological settings , ranging from switches in nanofluidic devices and networks  @xcite , to aqueous solution based catalysis in hydrophobic zeolites  @xcite . </S>"
