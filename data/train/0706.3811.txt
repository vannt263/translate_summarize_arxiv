    "the existence of gauge / sting dualities has been anticipated from the very beginning of these fields , based on the striking similarity between the large n thooft limit and the genus expansion in string theory .",
    "further insights were revealed with the discovery of d - branes , their description in terms of dbi action and identification as sources of the known p - brane solutions in super gravity .",
    "however it was not until maldacena conjectured his decoupling limit when significant progress was made and the ads / cft correspondence emerged @xcite as a manifestation of the gauge / string duality providing holographic description of super gravity on @xmath3 space in terms of @xmath4=4 susy yang - mills theory living at the asymptotic boundary .",
    "the observed correspondence was conjectured to hold for the full string theory on any asymptotically @xmath5 background .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of the correspondence is that it is a strong - weak correspondence and that it can give us tools to explore the strongly coupled regimes of the yang - mills theory .    in recent years progress",
    "has been made towards the study of matter in fundamental representation in the context of ads / cft correspondence .",
    "one way to achieve this is by introducing space filling flavor d7-branes in the probe limit @xcite and in order to keep the probe limit valid the condition @xmath6 is imposed .",
    "the fundamental strings stretched between the stack of @xmath7 d3 branes and the flavor @xmath8 d7-branes give rise to @xmath4=2 hypermultiplet , the separation of the d3 and d7 branes in the transverse directions corresponds to the mass of the hypermultiplet , the classical shape of the d7-brane encodes the value of the fermionic condensate and its quantum fluctuations describe the light meson spectrum of the theory @xcite .",
    "this technique for introducing fundamental matter has been widely employed in different backgrounds .",
    "of particular interest was the study of non supersymmetric backgrounds and phenomena such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these phenomena were first studied in this context in @xcite , where the authors developed an appropriate numerical technique . in recent years",
    "this approach received further development , and has proven itself as powerful tool for the exploration of confining gauge theories , in particular , for the description of their thermodynamic properties or for the building of phenomenological models relevant to qcd@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : + in the second section we review the method of introducing magnetic field to the theory , employed in @xcite . we describe the basic properties of the d7 brane embedding and the thermodynamic properties of the dual gauge theory , in particular the dependence of the fermionic condensate on the bare quark mass .",
    "we describe the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking caused by the external magnetic field and comment on the spiral structure in the condensate vs. bare quark mass diagram .",
    "the third section contains our main results and splits into two parts : + the first part is dedicated to the detailed study of the spiral structure described in @xcite .",
    "we perform analysis similar to the one considered in @xcite for the study of merger transitions and calculate the critical exponents of the bare quark mass and the fermionic condensate .",
    "we also describe the discrete self - similarity of the spiral and calculate the scaling factor characterizing it .    in the second part of this section we consider the meson spectrum of the states corresponding to the spiral .",
    "first we study the critical embedding corresponding to the center of the spiral and reveal an infinite tower of tachyonic states organized in a decreasing geometrical series .",
    "next we consider the dependence of the meson spectrum on the bare quark mass and confirm the expectations based on thermodynamic considerations that only the lowest branch of the spiral is stable .",
    "we observe that at each turn of the spiral there is one new tachyonic state .",
    "we comment on the self - similar structure of the spectrum and calculate the critical exponent of the meson mass .",
    "we also consider the spectrum corresponding to the lowest branch of the spiral and for a large bare quark mass reproduce the result for pure @xmath9 supersymmetric yang mills theory obtained in @xcite .",
    "we end with a short discussion of our results and the possible directions of future study .",
    "in this section we briefly review the method of introducing external magnetic field to the theory considered in @xcite and the basic properties of the d7-brane probe in this background .",
    "we also review the properties of the corresponding dual theory and the effect that the external magnetic field has on it .",
    "let us consider the @xmath10 geometry describing the near horizon geometry of a stack of @xmath7 extremal d3-branes .",
    "@xmath11    in order to introduce fundamental matter we first rewrite the metric in the following form : @xmath12+\\frac{r^2}{\\rho^2+l^2}[d\\rho^2+\\rho^2d\\omega_{3}^2+dl^2+l^2d\\phi^2],\\nonumber\\\\ d\\omega_{3}^2&=&d\\psi^2+\\cos^2\\psi d\\beta^2+\\sin^2\\psi d\\gamma^2 , \\label{geometry1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are polar coordinates in the transverse @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , satisfying : @xmath17 .",

    "the gauge field @xmath25 comes in next order in @xmath30 expansion compared to the metric and the @xmath1-field components . therefore to study the classical embedding of the d - brane one can leave only the @xmath31 part of the dbi - action .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that one can consistently satisfy the constraints imposed on the classical embedding resulting from integrating out @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting effective lagrangian is : @xmath32 the equation of motion for the profile @xmath33 of the d7-brane is given by : @xmath34 as expected for large @xmath35 or @xmath36 , we get the equation for the pure ads@xmath0 background @xcite : @xmath37 therefore the solutions to equation ( [ eqnmnl ] ) have the following behavior at infinity : @xmath38 where the parameters @xmath39 ( the asymptotic separation of the d7- and d3- branes ) and @xmath40 ( the degree of bending of the d7-brane ) are related to the bare quark mass @xmath41 and the fermionic condensate @xmath42 respectively @xcite .",
    "we have provided derivation of these relations in appendix a. as we shall see below , the presence of the external magnetic field and its effect on the dual sym provide a non vanishing value for the fermionic condensate , furthermore the theory exhibits chiral symmetry breaking .    now notice that @xmath28 enters in ( [ lagrangian ] ) only through the combination @xmath43 .",
    "the other natural scale is the asymptotic separation @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that different physical configurations can be studied in terms of the ratio @xmath44 : once the @xmath45 dependence of our solutions are known , the @xmath39 and @xmath28 dependence follows .",
    "indeed let us introduce dimensionless variables _ via _ : @xmath46 the equation of motion ( [ eqnmnl ] ) then takes the form : @xmath47 the solutions for @xmath48 can be expanded again to : @xmath49 and using the transformation ( [ cordchange ] ) we can get : @xmath50      the properties of the solution have been explored in @xcite , both numerically and analytically , when possible .",
    "let us briefly review the main results .",
    "for weak magnetic field @xmath28 and non - zero bare quark mass @xmath39 it was shown that the theory develops a fermionic condensate : @xmath51 or using dimensionless variables : @xmath52    the case of strong magnetic field @xmath28 can be explored by numerically solving equation ( [ eqnmnld ] ) , it is convenient to use initial conditions in the ir as has been recently discussed in the literature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we used the boundary condition @xmath53 .",
    "we used shooting techniques to generate the embedding of the d7 for a wide range of @xmath45 .",
    "having done so we expanded numerically the solutions for @xmath48 as in equation ( [ expansiond ] ) and generated the points in the @xmath54 plane corresponding to the solutions .",

    ", one can observe that the analytic result is valid for large @xmath45 .",
    "it is also evident that for @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding value of the condensate is @xmath57.,width=377 ]    as one can see there is a non zero fermionic condensate for zero bare quark mass and hence there is a spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the corresponding value of the condensate is @xmath57 .",
    "it is also evident that the analytical expression for the condensate ( [ 1/m ] ) that we got in the previous section is valid for large @xmath45 , as expected . now using equation ( [ hdepend ] )",
    "we can deduce the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath28 : @xmath59    another interesting feature of our phase diagram is the spiral behavior near the origin of the @xmath54-plane which can be seen in figure [ fig : spiral - revisited ] .",
    "note that the spiral presented in this figure has two arms , we have used the fact that any two points in the @xmath54 plane related by reflection with respect to the origin describe the same physical state .",
    "a similar spiraling feature has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors have argued that only the lowest branch of the spiral corresponding to positive values of @xmath39 is the stable one ( corresponding to the lowest energy state ) .",
    "the spiral behavior near the origin signals instability of the embedding corresponding to @xmath60 .",
    "if we trace the curve of the diagram in figure [ fig : spiral - revisited ] starting from large @xmath39 , as we go to smaller values of @xmath39 we will reach zero bare quark mass for some large negative value of the fermionic condensate @xmath61 .",
    "now if we continue tracing along the diagram one can verify numerically that all other points correspond to embeddings of the d7-brane which intersect the origin of the transverse plane at least once .",
    "after further study of the right arm of the spiral , one finds that the part of the diagram corresponding to negative values of @xmath45 represents solutions for the d7-brane embedding which intersect the origin of the transverse plane odd number of times , while the positive part of the spiral represents solutions which intersect the origin of the transverse plane even number of times .",
    "the lowest positive branch corresponds to solutions which do nt intersect the origin of the transverse plane and is the stable one , while the upper branches have correspondingly @xmath62 intersection points and are ruled out after evaluation of the free energy .",
    "indeed let us explore the stability of the spiral by calculating the regularized free energy of the system .",
    "we identify the free energy of the dual gauge theory @xcite , @xcite with the wick rotated and regularized on - shell action of the d7-brane : @xmath63 the second term under the sign of the integral in ( [ freeenergy ] ) , corresponds to the subtracted free energy of the @xmath64 embedding and serves as a regulator .",
    "now we can evaluate numerically the integral in ( [ freeenergy ] ) for the first several branches of the spiral .",
    "the corresponding plot is presented in figure [ fig : free - energy ] .",
    "note that we have plotted @xmath65 versus @xmath66 , since the bare quark mass depends only on the absolute value of the parameter @xmath45 .",

    "in the following section we analyze the spiral structure described in @xcite . the technique that we employ",

    "let us explore the asymptotic form of the equation of motion of the d7-brane probe ( [ eqnmnld ] ) in the near horizon limit @xmath69 . to this end",
    "we change coordinates to : @xmath70 and consider the limit @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting equation of motion is : @xmath72 equation ( [ rescaled ] ) enjoys the scaling symmetry : @xmath73 in the sense that if @xmath74 is a solution to the e.o.m .",
    "then @xmath75 is also a solution .",
    "next we focus on the region of the parametric space , close to the trivial @xmath76 embedding , by considering the expansion : @xmath77 and linearizing the e.o.m . .",

    "actually as we are going to show there is a linear map from the parametric space @xmath83 to the plane @xmath54 which explains the spiral structure , a subject of our study . to show this let us consider the linearized e.o.m . before taking the @xmath87 limit : @xmath88 with the solution : @xmath89 expanding at infinity : @xmath90",
    "we get : @xmath91 now if we match our solution ( [ linbefore ] ) with the solution in the @xmath92 limit ( [ linafter ] ) we should identify @xmath93 with the parameters @xmath94 . combining the rescaling property of @xmath83 with the linear map to @xmath54 we get that the embeddings close to the trivial embedding @xmath76 are represented in the @xmath54 plane by a double spiral defined _ via _ the transformation : @xmath95 note that the spiral is double , because we have the symmetry @xmath96 .",
    "this implies that in order to have similar configurations at scales @xmath97 and @xmath98 we should have : @xmath99 and hence : @xmath100 which is equivalent to : @xmath101 therefore we obtain that the discrete self - similarity is described by a rescaling by a factor of : @xmath102 this number will appear in the next subsection where we will study the meson spectrum . as one may expect the meson spectrum also has a self - similar structure",
    "it is interesting to confirm numerically the self - similar structure of the spiral and to calculate the critical exponents of the bare quark mass and the fermionic condensate .",
    "it is convenient to use the separation of the d3 and d7 branes at @xmath103 , @xmath104 as an order parameter .",
    "there is a discrete set of initial separations @xmath105 , corresponding to the points @xmath106 in figure [ fig : spiral - revisited ] , for which the corresponding d7 brane s embeddings asymptote to @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "the trivial @xmath109 embedding has @xmath110 and is the only one which has a zero fermionic condensate @xmath111 , the rest of the states have a non zero @xmath112 and hence a chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "each such point determines separate branch of the spiral where @xmath113 is a single valued function . on the other side",
    "each such branch has both positive @xmath45 and negative @xmath45 parts .",
    "the symmetry of the double spiral from figure [ fig : spiral - revisited ] , suggests that the states with negative @xmath45 are equivalent to positive @xmath114 states but with an opposite sign of @xmath112 .",
    "this implies that the positive and negative @xmath45 parts of each branch correspond to two different phases of the theory , with opposite signs of the condensate .",
    "as we can see from figure [ fig : free - energy ] the lowest positive branch of the spiral has the lowest free energy and thus corresponds to the stable phase of the theory . in the next subsection",
    "we will analyze the stability of the spiral further by studying the light meson spectrum of the theory near the critical @xmath109 embedding .",
    "here we are going to show that both the bare quark mass @xmath45 and the fermionic condensate @xmath112 have critical exponent one , as @xmath115 .",
    "indeed let us consider the scaling property ( [ scaling1 ] ) , ( [ scaling2 ] ) .",
    "if we start from some @xmath116 and transform to @xmath117 , we can solve for @xmath118 and using equation ( [ scaling2 ] ) we can verify that the bare quark mass and the fermionic condensate approach zero linearly as @xmath119 . to verify numerically our analysis we generated plots of @xmath120 vs. @xmath121 and @xmath122 vs. @xmath121 presented in figure [ fig : mspiral ] .",

    "we will explore the light meson spectrum of the theory corresponding to quadratic fluctuations of the d7 brane embedding .",

    "some interesting effects such as zeeman splitting of the states and a characteristic @xmath128 dependence of the meson spectrum have been reported .",

    "the chapter is organized as follows :    first we study the spectrum of the @xmath109 embedding in the spirit of the analysis provided in @xcite .",
    "we perform both a numerical and analytical study and show that the spectrum contains infinitely many tachyonic states approaching zero in a decreasing geometrical series , representing the self - similar structure of the meson spectrum .",
    "next we study the spectrum as a function of the bare quark mass and show that at each turn of the spiral one of the energy levels become tachyonic .",
    "similar behavior has been recently reported in @xcite .",
    "we show that as we approach the critical @xmath109 embedding the spectrum becomes tachyonic and the corresponding critical exponent is two .",
    "we also present plots showing the spiraling of the spectrum as one approaches criticality .",
    "finally we provide an analysis of the spectrum of the stable branch of the spiral and comment on the small @xmath45 behavior of the spectrum as a consistent with the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scenario .",
    "in this section we study the @xmath109 embedding and in particular the spectrum of the fluctuations along the @xmath127 coordinate .",
    "let us go back to dimensionfull coordinates and consider the following change of coordinates in the transverse @xmath132 space :    @xmath133    in these coordinates the trivial embedding corresponds to @xmath134 and in order to study the quadratic fluctuations we perform the expansion : @xmath135    note that in order to study the mass spectrum we restrict the d7 brane to fluctuate only in time .",
    "in a sense this corresponds to going to the rest frame .",
    "note that due to the presence of the magnetic field there is a coupling of the scalar spectrum to the vector one , however for the fluctuations along @xmath136 the coupling depends on the momenta in the @xmath137 plane and this is why considering the rest frame is particularly convenient .",
    "our analysis follows closely the one considered in @xcite , where the authors have calculated the quasinormal modes of the d7-brane embedding in the ads - black hole background by imposing an in - going boundary condition at the horizon of the black hole .",
    "our case is the @xmath138 limit and the horizon is extremal , however the @xmath134 embedding can still have quasinormal excitations with imaginary frequencies , corresponding to a real wave function so that there is no flux of particles falling into the zero temperature horizon . the resulting equation of motion",
