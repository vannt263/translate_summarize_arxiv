    "the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( bhbs ) are known to be highly variable .",
    "the temporal structure exhibits diverse morphologies ( @xcite ) , which can vary from a single smooth large pulse to an extremely complex light curve with many erratic spikes ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) . from the observational point of view , most of the observed light curves are favored the later case , i.e. , presented with many spikes overlapping within a short duration ( e.g. , figure 1 , 4 , and 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed that the observed variabilities may provide an interesting clue to understand the nature of grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the variabilities of the prompt emission , such as internal shock model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , relativistic mini - jets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or relativistic turbulence ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in a bulk relativistic jet . within the internal shock model ,",
    "the variabilities of prompt emission are attributed to the history of central engine activity .",
    "then , the variabilities from the central engine may be important for our understanding of grbs nature .",
    "several scenarios for grbs central engine have been discussed in the literature ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the leading type of these scenarios is a stellar - mass black hole surrounded by a hyper - accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this type , two kind of energy reservoirs",
    "are proposed to provide the jet power .",
    "the first kind of energy reservoir is the rotational energy of black hole / accretion disk , which can be extracted through the blandford - znajek / blandford - payne mechanism ( bz / bp model ) by the aid of large - scale magnetic field in the disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the second kind of energy reservoir is the accretion energy in the disk carried by neutrinos and antineutrinos . the annihilation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs outside the disk fuels a relativistic jet .",
    "in these two energy reservoirs , the formation of jets is associated with the hyper - accretion disk .",
    "then , it is natural to expect that the variabilities in the hyper - accretion disk would lead to the fluctuations of jet ( @xcite ) . in black hole binaries ( bhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , x - ray emission from accretion disks is observed to display significant aperiodic variabilities on a broad range of timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it reveals that fluctuations may appear in the accretion disk of bhbs and agns .",
    "one basic question is that , what would be the behaviour of jet in grbs , if the mechanism driving fluctuations in the disk of bhbs and agns operates in a hyper - accretion disk .",
    "this is the focus of our work .    for the variabilities of x - ray emission in bhbs and agns ,",
    "the most promising explanation is the model of propagating fluctuations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the variabilities of disk emission arise from the fluctuations of mass accretion rate , which are produced at different radii and propagate into the inner region of the disk .",
    "the fluctuations of mass accretion rate in the inner region would modulate the energy released in the vicinity of black hole , where produces most of x - ray emission .",
    "observations have shown that the variabilities of x - ray emission are non - linear .",
    "in addition , the root - mean - square ( @xmath0 ) variability is proportional to the average flux over a wide range of time - scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that short time - scale variations are modulated by those with longer time - scales , and thus favours the model of propagating fluctuations . in this work",
    ", we adopt the model of propagating fluctuations to study the variabilities of jet power in grbs .",
    "as first suggested by @xcite , if the viscosity parameter @xmath1 fluctuates at each radius on the local viscous timescale and in a spatially uncorrelated manner , the characteristic power spectral density ( psd ) of observed x - ray variabilities can be reproduced .",
    "following the work of @xcite , we discretize the accretion disk into a finite number of annulus .",
    "the ratio between radii for consecutive annulus remains constant . with this kind of geometric spacing and keeping a constant variability power of @xmath1 for different annulus , the characteristic shape of x - ray variabilities psd can be produced .",
    "then , the fluctuations of @xmath1 in an annulus is modelled as @xmath2^\\xi,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are constants , @xmath6 is the radius of annulus relative to the central black hole , and @xmath7 sets the fluctuations of @xmath8 .",
    "the conditions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are adopted , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the average value and maximum absolute value of @xmath7 , respectively . in order to produce most of variability power at the viscous timescale @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath7 is modelled as random fluctuations with a lorentzian - shaped - psd , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is adopted and @xmath16 determines the width of the lorentzian - shape ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relation of @xmath17 is found for an accretion disk , where @xmath18 is the the kinematic viscosity .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath19 would determine the fluctuation of @xmath1 or the value of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 represents the amplitude of @xmath1 fluctuation . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "the condition of @xmath22 is adopted in order to find the fluctuations of mass accretion rate by analytical method .",
    "however , @xmath22 does not the requirement of the propagating fluctuations model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , a turbulent viscous stress , which is believed to be arose from the magneto - hydrodynamic rotational instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , always shows high - amplitude variabilities as indicated by numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one can find this behavior in figure  10 of @xcite , of which the ratio of maximum @xmath1 to minimum @xmath1 can reach @xmath23 .",
    "this reveals that the value of @xmath19 can be as high as @xmath24 . in our work",
    ", we will discuss the situations with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , which can reproduce the observed psd of disk emission in bhbs and agns ( see discussions in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "for these situations , @xmath28 or @xmath22 does not satisfy .",
    "then , we present numerical studies on the fluctuations of mass accretion rate .",
    "in the model of propagating fluctuations , the fluctuations of @xmath1 would produce a varying mass accretion rate @xmath29 in the inner region of disk .",
    "the value of @xmath29 in the disk can be estimated * as * ( e.g. , equation  ( 3.15 ) in @xcite ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the sound velocity of gas , @xmath33 is the half thickness of the disk at radius @xmath6 , and the surface density @xmath34 satisfies ( e.g. , equation  ( 3.18 ) in @xcite ) @xmath35.\\ ] ] equations  ( [ eq : accretion rate ] ) and ( [ eq : surface_density ] ) are the same as equations  ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) in @xcite , respectively , but with different symbol for surface density of disk .",
    "as showed in @xcite , equations  ( [ eq : accretion rate ] ) and ( [ eq : surface_density ] ) can present a better explanation for the observed variabilities .",
    "in addition , the results found in our work are the qualitative results",
    ". then , we use equations  ( [ eq : accretion rate ] ) and ( [ eq : surface_density ] ) to study the variabilities of grbs .",
    "the outflow and gas adding into the disk , which are not considered in equation  ( [ eq : surface_density ] ) , may be present in the central engine of grbs , bhbs , and agns .",
    "however , the disk emission in bhbs and agns is also observed with highly variable even above two ingredients are believed to be present in the disk .",
    "that is to say , the outflow and gas adding into the disk do not alter the highly variable behavior in bhbs , agns , and the central engine of grbs ( @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the variabilities of grbs jet under the situation that the mechanism driving x - ray variabilities in bhbs and agns operates in a hyper - accretion disk .",
    "then , the outflow and gas adding into the disk are not considered .",
    "the value of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is associated with the advection factor @xmath36 of the accretion flow , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the advection cooling ( viscous heating ) in the accretion flow , and @xmath41 is the kepler s rotation velocity of gas around black hole .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 are found in the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; @xcite ) and in the inner region of neutrino - cooling - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "since the value of @xmath33 does not change significantly for these two cases , we adopt @xmath44 in our calculations . then , the value of @xmath32 can be estimated with @xmath45 .      in order to estimate the variabilities of jet power",
    ", the dependence of jet power on @xmath29 should be prescribed .",
    "the dominant paradigms for jet production are outlined in the works of @xcite and @xcite . in both of the models ( i.e. , bz / bp model )",
    ", the jet power @xmath46 can be modeled as ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 is taken to follow the radial loss rate of gravitational energy in the accretion flow , @xmath50 is the schwarzschild radius of black hole , and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the inner ( outer ) radius of disk involved to produce the jet .",
    "the observations show that the launch region of jet in m87 is limited to @xmath53 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "then , we adopt @xmath54 and @xmath55 in our calculations .    in a ndaf , the jet may be powered by neutrino - antineutrino annihilation , which depends on the luminosity of hyper - accretion disk .",
    "the disk luminosity can be estimated with @xmath29 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58 where @xmath52 is the outer radius of ndaf . for disks with @xmath29 satisfying @xmath59",

    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are the critical mass accretion rates for igniting and suppressing neutrino cooling , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , the dependence of @xmath64 on the radius may be modeled as @xmath65 with @xmath66 . with @xmath67 in equation  ( [ eq : disk_luminosity_init ] )",

    "as showed by @xcite , the variabilities of @xmath81 produced with equation  ( [ eq : jet_power_nu ] ) and constant mean value of @xmath82 do not present significantly difference from the variabilities of @xmath83 . to simplify , equation  ( [ eq : jet_power_nu ] )",
    "is used with @xmath55 and @xmath84 , which does not affect our qualitative conclusions in this work .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : jet_power ] ) and ( [ eq : jet_power_nu ] ) are used to estimate the variabilities of jet power .",
    "since we are interested in the variabilities of jet power , the jet power is normalized with its maximum value in our simulations .",
    "the black hole - torus engine is widely discussed in both the collapsar scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the compact star merger scenario ( @xcite ) . in the collapsar scenario , the accretion of the stellar core , which forms an accretion disk around the central black hole , fuels the prompt emission . in the compact star merger scenario ,",
    "a debris disc is formed within only a few dynamical time - scales when the lighter companion neutron star is tidally disrupted .",

    "<S> the emission from black hole binaries ( bhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) displays significant aperiodic variabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the most promising explanation for these variabilities is the propagating fluctuations in the accretion flow . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to expect that the mechanism driving variabilities in bhbs and agns may operate in a black hole hyper - accretion disk , which is believed to power gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . </S>",

    "<S> it is found that the variabilities of jet power and the temporal profile of erratic spikes in this scenario are similar to those in observed light curves of prompt gamma - ray emission of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the mechanism driving x - ray variabilities in bhbs and agns may operate in the central engine to drive the variabilities of grbs .    </S>",
