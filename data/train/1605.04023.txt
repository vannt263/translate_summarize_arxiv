    "ligo s recent discovery of the gravitational wave ( gw ) from an inspiralling binary black hole ( bh ) system of essentially equal mass bhs ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath8@xcite has led to suggestion that all or at least a significant part of the dark matter ( dm ) is made up of primordial bhs ( pbh ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite argue that this pbh mass range is not ruled out by astronomical observations and the observed rate at @xmath9(a few ) gpc@xmath10yr@xmath3 @xcite can be accounted for if dm pbhs are distributed in dense , low velocity - dispersion concentrations which escaped merging .",
    "there is abundant motivation for pbhs forming in the very early universe @xcite , e.g. during phase transition at the qcd epoch when horizon mass is of the right magnitude @xcite ; see a nice overview of possible mechanisms in @xcite .",
    "if pbhs indeed constitute the bulk or all of dm , they would contribute an additional poissonian component to the power spectrum of the mass distribution from adiabatic fluctuations from the earlier inflationary era @xcite .",
    "if so , this component would dominate small scales leading to significant modification of the history of collapse ( and possibly formation of the first sources ) , resulting in greater rates of cosmic infrared background ( cib ) production at @xmath11 .",

    "this proposition is currently a subject of debate @xcite , although the cib fluctuations on relevant scales appear to be uncorrelated with the diffuse light in the visible produced by sources down to ab mag @xmath13 @xcite , but , at least in its present form , fails to account for numerous prior observational cib data @xcite ; see e.g. fig .",

    "2 ) the angular shape of the cib power spectrum on arcminute scales reflects the epochs spanned by the sources ; the shape from the _ spitzer _ data is consistent with high-@xmath1 origin within the current errors and the upcoming _ euclid _ all - sky survey would further probe the epochs and history of emissions much more accurately @xcite .",

    "cib integrated / bolometric flux levels depend on three efficiency parameters : 1 ) the efficiency of collapse of halos suitable for forming luminous sources , or the mass - fraction of the universe in these halos , denoted @xmath16 , 2 ) the formation efficiency of conversion of baryons inside each halo into luminous sources , @xmath17 , and 3 ) the radiation efficiency of converting the rest mass into radiation for the luminous sources inside the collapsed halos , @xmath18 .",

    "populations at high @xmath1 are strongly biased , span a short period of cosmic time , and would be expected to produce cib with relative fluctuation amplitude of @xmath20 on arcminute scales , which would then require producing @xmath21 nw m@xmath2 sr@xmath3 @xcite in the integrated flux at near - ir wavelengths @xmath22 .",

    "furthermore , unlike the part of the power from clustering , white noise power contributions to the angular cib power spectrum are not affected by biasing amplification @xcite .",

    "in general , collapse and subsequent formation of compact objects is driven by balance between pressure and gravity , which in turn is determined by cooling in the collapsing gas .",
    "two modes of halo collapse are relevant here : if enough h@xmath70 forms the gas will have @xmath71k and in the absence of metals the h cooling will in any event keep the gas at @xmath72k ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the resultant rms density fluctuation vs mass at various @xmath1 relevant here for @xmath73 with the vertical lines demarcating where the halo virial temperatures exceed these limits .",
    "the strong increase in the rms density contrast , over that in the absence of the pbhs , at masses of the first halos capable of producing luminous objects , is obvious .",
    "this increase will lead to substantially more collapsed halos capable for forming luminous sources at @xmath32 .",
    "we use the press - schechter formalism @xcite to compute the fraction of collapsed halos as the probability of a density field region with virial temperature @xmath74 having overdensity @xmath75 . for gaussian - distributed density fluctuation",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the fraction in halos that collapsed by @xmath1 having @xmath77 ( right ) and @xmath78k for @xmath73 .",
    "the increase in @xmath16 is large enough to produce the required cib flux with very modest baryon conversion efficiencies ( eq . [ eq : fraction_bc ] ) of well below @xmath79 for the h - burning @xmath80 even by @xmath81 in halos with @xmath82-cooling . even in halos with @xmath77k ,",
    "the required @xmath17 remains at a modest few percent level at @xmath83 for @xmath57 . if the bulk of the cib comes from bh accretion , the values of the required @xmath17 drop by over an order of magnitude .",
    "thus to account for the observed near - ir cib fluctuation signal with high-@xmath1 emissions , very few baryons would need to be converted into luminous sources inside first collapsed halos at @xmath84 if the dm is made of pbhs such as discovered by ligo .",
    "if pbhs make up dm , luminous sources within the much more abundant early collapsed halos would reproduce the observed _ spitzer / akari _ source - subtracted cib fluctuations with modest formation efficiency requirements .",
    "this can be demonstrated by taking population models from @xcite and rescaling them by the collapse - efficiency ratio from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . thus fig .",
    "2 , upper right from @xcite would now reproduce the observed cib signal with only @xmath85 forming out to @xmath86 ( instead of 4% with formation continuing to @xmath87 ) and the lines in fig . 5 of @xcite need to be rescaled down by the corresponding factors .",
    "additionally the measured cib - cxb coherence @xcite would require that at least @xmath88(1015)% of the luminous cib - producing sources are accreting bhs , broadly consistent with this discussion .",
    "we now outline briefly the possible modifications in the early collapse and source formation that the pbhs may require .",
    "two temperature regimes are relevant for description of emitting sources : 1 ) minihalos where h@xmath70 formation is efficient evolve at @xmath89k and the gas converges toward density of @xmath90cm@xmath10 ( * ? ? ? * and refs therein ) , 2 ) in the absence of h@xmath70 , the metal - free gas will be able to cool to @xmath92k and collapse in halos with larger virial temperature will proceed isothermally .",
    "feedback effects from first sources would affect h@xmath70 formation via a resulting lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation at [ 11.2 - 13.6]ev ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "gas collapse / evolution in the pbh minihalos may affect the subsequent emitting source formation inside them .",
    "pbhs will accrete the minihalo gas resulting in both the additional source of emission from pbh accretion as well as the lw radiation feedback .",
    "the gas at sound speed @xmath93 within the halo of velocity dispersion @xmath94 will be accreted within the typical radius @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "the total accretion mass will be @xmath97 . for typical parameters this may be a non - negligible fraction of the minihalo baryons at @xmath98 up to a few percent , but will not increase the pbh mass dramatically .",
    "( note the sensitive dependence on @xmath99 , so @xmath100 is rapidly decreased when @xmath101km / sec ) .",
    "the spectrum of the resultant emission may be modeled after @xcite : 1 ) the multicolor black - body from different parts of the accretion disc with temperatures up to @xmath102kev shifted mainly into observer s near - ir , after reprocessing by the surrounding medium , and 2 ) hot corona and reflection emissions , which leave their mark in the observer soft x - rays .",
    "the coherence between the near - ir and x - ray emissions would be strong for the pbhs because of the larger value of @xmath103 than for dcbhs .",
    "this mode of evolution , inevitable if pbhs make up dm , may influence adjacent star formation and dcbh collapse and evolution as discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the pbhs in minihalos will evolve via stellar dynamical effects similar to that discussed in @xcite and by loss of energy to gw emissions @xcite .",
    "stellar evaporation will lead to a core - halo structure with the isothermal core of radius @xmath104 and @xmath105 pbhs evolving on gyr - timescales @xmath106 , at constant binding energy , or @xmath107 , because evaporating pbhs carry zero energy . at the same time , a fraction of pbhs will become binary when gw emission exceeds their kinetic energy ( @xmath108 ) ; the cross - section for this process being @xmath109 @xcite . the fraction of pbhs that will form binaries before evaporation is then @xmath110 instead of evaporating the resultant binaries will spiral in to the center due to dynamical friction possibly forming a central large bh contributing to the massive bh formation in early universe .    finally , we note further constraints from reionization by both first stars and bhs as discussed in this context in @xcite . while reionization would be complicated in the presence of x - rays @xcite , the thomson optical depth of @xmath111 may imply that the ionizing photons at rest @xmath112 are mostly absorbed in their paternal minihalos , although @xcite recover @xmath113 from hot gaseous bubbles reionized by first stars producing the observed cib levels and forming to @xmath114 .",
    "the situation , while important , is clearly model - dependent : emissions probed at observer @xmath115 , where current cib data appear established , would translate directly into ionizing , lyman - continuum , photons only at @xmath116 ; at these epochs the baryon density is high and harder to reionize and only a small fraction of the cib is expected to be produced .",
    "a possibility , discussed in @xcite for the dcbh model , whereby the gaseous collapsed halos are compton thick so the ionizing photons are absorbed and reprocessed into a two - photon continuum , may also appear relevant here .",
