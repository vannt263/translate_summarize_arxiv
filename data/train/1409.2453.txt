    "for each case , compared to the previous epoch s position , these points were offset along a position angle of @xmath62 east of north , suggesting that low - level jet activity was affecting the apparent core position .",
    "this was dramatically confirmed on 2013 may 24 when a superluminal jet component moving along position angle @xmath57 dominated the emission ( see section [ sect : jetmotion ] ) .    generally for vlbi measurements , formal position precision does not fully represent astrometric accuracy .",
    "typically , slowly varying ( @xmath59hours ) uncompensated differences in tropospheric propagation delays among antennas and sometimes structural changes in the radio sources among epochs lead to degraded position accuracy @xcite . in order to account for these effects",

    ". we can then add error - floor values in quadrature with the formal measurement uncertainties and adjust their values to achieve component chi - squares per degree of freedom ( @xmath64 ) near unity in each coordinate . in this way , the more jittery data parallel to the jet receives a larger total uncertainty and is appropriately down - weighted compared to the more stable data perpendicular to the jet . after removing the two outliers discussed above , we achieved @xmath65 for each component of the data with error floors of 0.09 and 0.19 mas for the position residuals perpendicular and parallel to the jet , respectively .",
    "given the ( expected ) larger uncertainties in the parallel compared to the perpendicular data , and the shape of the parallax ellipse which has a smaller amplitude in the parallel compared to the perpendicular direction , the parallax for  is nearly totally constrained by the perpendicular - to - the - jet data .",
    "fitting for the parallax of  _ relative _ to the galactic water maser source , with no prior constraints on distance , gives @xmath66 mas , which places both sources at nearly the same distance .",

    "[ fig : parallax ] displays the relative parallax and proper motion for both the data and the model .",
    "changing the position angle rotation of the data by @xmath67 changes the relative parallax by about @xmath68 mas .",

    "these data were originally presented by @xcite , who reported a parallax for  of @xmath69 mas measured relative to .",

    "thus , we adopt @xmath83 kpc with uniform probability as prior information when fitting the data .",
    "traditionally , when fitting relative position as a function of time , one parameterizes the model with a parallax parameter ( and proper motion terms ) .",
    "owing to the inverse relation between distance and parallax , @xmath84 , a flat distance prior transforms to a quadratic parallax prior : @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 for @xmath83 kpc and zero elsewhere ) .",
    "then after fitting , the posteriori probability density function ( pdf ) for parallax should be transformed to the desired distance pdf , rescaling by @xmath87 ( in order to account for the non - linear stretching of @xmath78 with decreasing @xmath84 ) .",
    "this latter scaling is important only if the parallax uncertainty is a significant fraction (  @xmath88% ) of the parallax .",
    "alternatively , one can fit the data with a model parameterized with distance instead of parallax .",
    "this is more convenient when applying prior information on distance and gives the desired distance pdf directly without rescaling .",
    "of course , both approaches are equivalent .",
    "we adopted the distance parameterization for our final fits and obtain the posteriori pdf for the distance of  shown in fig .",

    "the peak of the pdf is at 7.8 kpc , and the expectation value for distance is 8.6 kpc , reflecting the asymmetric tail of the pdf toward larger distances .",
    "the minimum - width 68% confidence interval is 7.0 to 10.6 kpc , which includes the small contribution from the distance uncertainty of the maser . adopting the expectation value as the best estimate of distance",

    "( 2013 ) , is limited by the published radial velocity values of the template stars used .",
    "we retrieved several archival spectra of one of our templates , hd  176354 , which was observed with the high - resolution harps spectrograph at eso .",
    "four observations that span four years show a very stable velocity for this template of @xmath91 .",
    "this translates into a refined heliocentric systemic velocity for  of @xmath92  .",

    "the lorentz factors of ballistic jets from black hole microquasars are generally assumed to be in the vicinity @xmath97 @xcite , although there is a dearth of strong constraints .",
    "specifically , the bulk of observational data provide only _ lower _ limits on the lorentz factor , when derived directly from kinematic measurements and flux ratios . generally , these lower limits fall near @xmath98 @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "proper motion data are frequently unable to place significant upper bounds on @xmath99 .",
    "this is due to the strong , nonlinear degeneracy between @xmath99 and distance , particularly when @xmath99 is large and the distance estimate approaches the maximum limit , @xmath100 , at which @xmath101 .",
    "only when @xmath99 is relatively modest and the distance is well - constrained below @xmath100 can the lorenz factor be reliably bounded from above via kinematic data .",
    "although direct measurements provide only limited upper bounds for @xmath99 , there are indirect arguments which suggest that lorentz factors are modest , usually @xmath102 , e.g. , based on observations of radio - x - ray coupling @xcite and of the deceleration of jets at late times as they expand @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been argued that microquasar jets may have @xmath103 , based on observations of very narrow jet opening angles and the assumption that the jet plasma expands freely at nearly the speed of light @xcite .",

    "have provided evidence for such confinement in some systems .    during one observation ( see section [ sect : jetmotion ] ) , we observed a motion of @xmath56  along a position angle of @xmath104 , consistent with the approaching jet in . at the parallax distance of 8.6 kpc , this corresponds to @xmath105 , where @xmath80 is the speed of light , making this source just marginally superluminal .",
    "the magnitude of the motion we measured agrees ( exactly ) with that measured by @xcite for the approaching jet of @xmath56 mas d@xmath106 , but our position angle differs significantly from their value of @xmath107 , estimated from the orientation on the sky of multiple jet components separated by @xmath108 mas in 1997 november .",

    "the peculiar velocity components for  estimated in section [ sect : propermotion ] are relatively modest and consistent with an old stellar system that has orbited the galaxy many times , having responded to random gravitational perturbations from encounters with spiral arms and giant molecular clouds , and acquired a peculiar velocity of 20 - 30  as observed .",
    "this suggests that the  binary system did not receive a large velocity `` kick , '' owing to mass loss from the primary as it evolved and became a black hole .",
