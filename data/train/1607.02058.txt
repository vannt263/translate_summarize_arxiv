    "the study of the @xmath9 interaction with coupled channels has been a traditional test field for chiral dynamics in its unitarized version . since the pioneer works of  @xcite , many works have been done in this field including also the contribution of the higher order chiral lagrangians ( see recent review in  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the unexpected results was the finding of two poles for the @xmath4 resonance @xcite , which recently became official in the particle data group  @xcite [ see note on the @xmath4  @xcite ] .",
    "the other issue that became topical was the possibility of having kaonic nuclei , in particular a bound @xmath7 system .",
    "the study of this system has been thoroughly addressed theoretically  @xcite ( see review paper in  @xcite ) , obtaining a binding energy that varies from a few mev to 100 mev .",
    "there are also discrepancies in the width of the state , which varies from 10 to 90 mev .",
    "one step forward in the evaluation of the width was given in  @xcite , where two - nucleon @xmath10 absorption was explicitly considered .",
    "in that study a binding of 1530 mev was found , together with a width of the order of 80 mev .",
    "the fact that the width is larger than the binding energy is shared by most of the theoretical approaches .",
    "one interesting point of view was to consider this system as a bound state of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this allows one to make some qualitative pictures that help understanding some of the results obtained when studying the possible formation of this system in different reactions .",
    "there have been previous claims of the formation of this state in some experiments , but soon the experimental signals were interpreted in terms of unavoidable conventional mechanisms ( see overview in @xcite ) . yet , the experimental search has continued  @xcite with often contradictory views ( see overview in  @xcite ) .    in this line , very recently , a peak structure was observed near the @xmath0 threshold in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum of the in - flight @xmath12 reaction of the j - parc e15 experiment  @xcite . according to their analysis , this peak can be described by the breit - wigner formula with mass @xmath13 and width @xmath14 .",
    "this structure could be a signal of the @xmath2 bound state with a binding of @xmath15 from the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "in this paper we theoretically investigate the origin of the peak structure observed in the j - parc e15 experiment . for this purpose ,",
    "we take into account two possible mechanisms for producing a peak in the mass spectrum of the @xmath16 reaction .",
    "one corresponds to assuming the formation of a @xmath17 resonance that does not not form a bound state with the remaining proton , while the other considers the formation of a bound state of the @xmath7 system .",
    "we evaluate the cross section of the @xmath16 reaction assuming the @xmath18 scattering around threshold and the @xmath4 resonance to be described by the chiral unitary approach  @xcite , while the description of the @xmath7 bound state is done in terms of the so - called fixed center approximation to the faddeev equation  @xcite .    as a result",
    ", we can unambiguously interpret the experimental spectrum in the scenario of a @xmath7 broad bound state , obtained from the interaction of the @xmath10 with a pair of nucleons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in this scenario , we obtain a two peak structure of the mass spectrum near the @xmath19 threshold .",
    "the peak below the threshold is the signal of the @xmath7 bound state , while the peak above the threshold originates from the quasi - elastic scattering of the kaon in the first collision emitting a fast nucleon , in processes of the type @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",

    "[ sec:2 ] we develop our formulation to obtain the cross section of the @xmath16 reaction , describing the details that allow us to obtain the scattering amplitude for the uncorrelated @xmath22 mechanism and for the @xmath19 bound state one .",

    "this process has a possibility of making a peak structure around the @xmath0 threshold in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum , since the @xmath17 resonance appears below the @xmath61 threshold . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3na ] we show the two diagrams which implicitly contain the @xmath17 resonance in the intermediate state . in these diagrams , a fast neutron is emitted after the first collision of the @xmath26 with a nucleon ( @xmath62 ) .",

    "finally , the rescattered @xmath26 is absorbed into a proton to become a @xmath33 particle .",
    "an important point is that one expects a kaon , rather than another meson like the @xmath65 or the pion , to be absorbed by the last nucleon because 1 ) the propagating kaon after the first collision is almost on its mass shell , hence the amplitude @xmath64 covers the region of the @xmath4 resonance , 2 ) the @xmath66 is expected to be a @xmath67 bound state  @xcite , hence the process is dominated by the isospin @xmath68 component of the @xmath9 interaction , and 3 ) the coupling strength of the @xmath69 vertex is strong while that of @xmath70 is very weak in flavor su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : t_fca ] and related discussions below ) .",
    "we note that the exchanged kaon after the secondary scattering ( @xmath89 ) goes highly off its mass shell in the present kinematics , so the term @xmath90 is unnecessary in the denominator of the corresponding propagator .",
    "the energies of the intermediate kaons are fixed in two ways : one employs the watson approach  @xcite and the other one relies on the truncated faddeev approach  @xcite , to which we refer as options a and b , respectively .",

    "<S> a theoretical investigation is done to clarify the origin of the peak structure observed near the @xmath0 threshold in the in - flight @xmath1 reaction of the j - parc e15 experiment , which could be a signal of the lightest kaonic nuclei , that is , the @xmath2 state . for the investigation </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum assuming two possible scenarios to interpret the experimental peak . </S>",
    "<S> one assumes that the @xmath4 resonance is generated after the emission of an energetic neutron from the absorption of the initial @xmath5 , not forming a bound state with the remaining proton . </S>",
    "<S> this uncorrelated @xmath6 system subsequently decays into the final @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the other scenario implies that , after the emission of the energetic neutron , a @xmath7 bound state is formed , decaying eventually into a @xmath3 pair . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the experimental signal observed in the in - flight @xmath8 reaction at j - parc is qualitatively well reproduced by the assumption that a @xmath7 bound state is generated in the reaction , definitely discarding the interpretation in terms of an uncorrelated @xmath6 state . </S>"
