    "many times as researchers in combinatorics we face the task of computing an evaluation of the tutte polynomial of a family of graphs or matroids . sometimes this is not an easy task , or at least time consuming .",
    "later , not surprisingly , we find out that a formula was known for a class of graphs or matroids that contains our family . here",
    "we survey some of the best known formulas for some interesting families of graphs and matroids .",
    "our hope is for researchers to have a place to look for a tutte polynomial before engaging in the search for the tutte polynomial formula for the considered family .",
    "we present along with the formulas , some explanation of the techniques used to compute them .",
    "this may also provide tools for computing the tutte polynomials of new families of graphs or matroids .",
    "this survey can also be considered a companion to the book chapter graph polynomials and their applications i : the tutte polynomial by j.  ellis - monaghan and c.  merino  @xcite . there",
    ", the authors give an introduction of the tutte polynomial for a general audience of scientists , pointing out relevant relations between different areas of knowledge .",
    "but very few explicit calculations are made .",
    "here we consider the practical side of computing the tutte polynomial .",
    "however , we are not presenting evaluations , that is an immense area of research for the tutte polynomial , nor analysing the complexity of computing the invariant for the different families . for the former",
    "we strongly recommend the book of d.j.a .",
    "welsh @xcite , for the latter we recommend s.d .",
    "noble s book chapter @xcite .",
    "there are many sources for the theory behind this important invariant .",
    "the most useful is definitively j. oxley and t. brylawski book chapter @xcite .",
    "we already mentioned  @xcite , which also surveys a variety of information about the tutte polynomial of a graph , some of it new .",
    "we also do not address the closely related problem of characterizing families of matroids by their tutte polynomial , a problem which is generally known as tutte uniqueness .",
    "for this there are also several articles , for example  @xcite .",
    "we assume knowledge of graph theory as in @xcite and matroid theory as in @xcite .",
    "further details of many of the concepts treated here can be found in welsh  @xcite and oxley and brylawski  @xcite .",
    "some of the richness of the tutte polynomial is due to its numerous equivalent definitions ; which is probably inherited from the vast number of equivalent definitions of the concept of matroid . in this chapter",
    "we revise three definitions and we put them to practice by computing the tutte of some families of matroids , in particular uniform matroids .",
    "one of the simplest definitions , which is often the easiest way to prove properties of the tutte polynomial , uses the notion of rank .",
    "if @xmath0 is a matroid , where @xmath1 is the rank - function of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , we denote @xmath4 by @xmath5 and @xmath6 by @xmath7 , the latter is called the nullity of @xmath8 .",
    "[ definition ] the tutte polynomial of @xmath2 , @xmath9 , is defined as follows : @xmath10      recall that if @xmath0 is a matroid , then @xmath11 is its dual matroid , where @xmath12 . because @xmath13 and @xmath14 , you get the following equality @xmath15 this gives the first technique to compute a tutte polynomial .",
    "if you know the tutte polynomial of @xmath2 then you know the tutte polynomial of the dual matroid @xmath16 .",
    "our first example is the family of uniform matroids @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . here",
    "the tutte polynomial can be computed easily using ( [ eq : expansion ] ) because all subsets of size @xmath19 are independent , so @xmath20 is zero ; all subsets of size @xmath21 are spanning , so @xmath22 is zero and if a subset is independent and spanning , then it is a basis of the matroid .",
    "@xmath23    thus , for @xmath24 we get @xmath25 as @xmath26 , we get by using equation  ( [ eq : duality ] ) @xmath27      given a matroid @xmath0 with a subset @xmath28 that is both a circuit and a hyperplane , we can define a new matroid @xmath29 as the matroid with basis @xmath30 . that @xmath29 is",
    "indeed a matroid is easy to check .",
    "for example , @xmath31 is the unique relaxation of @xmath32 .",
    "the tutte polynomial of @xmath29 can be computed easily from the tutte polynomial of @xmath2 by using equation  ( [ eq : expansion ] ) .",
    "@xmath33    matroid relaxation will be used extensively in the last section .",
    "our second example can be considered a generalization of uniform matroids but it is a much larger and richer family . a _ paving matroid _",
    "@xmath0 is a matroid whose circuits all have size at least @xmath1 .",
    "uniform matroids are an example of paving matroids . paving matroids",
    "are closed under minors and the set of excluded minors for the class consists of the matroid @xmath34 , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the interest about paving matroids goes back to 1976 when dominic welsh asked if most matroids were paving , see  @xcite .",
    "_ sparse paving matroids _ were introduced in  @xcite .",
    "a rank-@xmath1 matroid @xmath2 is sparse paving if @xmath2 is paving and for every pair of circuits @xmath35 and @xmath36 of size @xmath1 we have @xmath37 .",
    "for example , all uniform matroids are sparse paving matroids .",
    "there is a simple characterization of paving matroids which are sparse in terms of the sizes of their hyperplanes . for a proof ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "[ sparse_circuit_hyperplane ] let @xmath2 be a paving matroid of rank @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath2 is sparse paving if and only if all the hyperplanes of @xmath2 have size @xmath1 or @xmath39 .",
    "note that we can say a little more , any circuit of size @xmath1 is a hyperplane .",
    "conversely , any proper subset of a hyperplane of size @xmath1 is independent and so such a hyperplane must be a circuit .",
    "thus , the circuits of size @xmath1 are precisely the hyperplanes of size @xmath1",
    ".    many invariants that are usually difficult to compute for a general matroid are easy for sparse paving matroids .",
    "for example , observe that if @xmath2 is sparse paving , all subsets of size @xmath40 are independent , and all subsets of size @xmath41 are spanning . on the other hand",
    "the subsets of size @xmath1 are either bases or circuit  hyperplanes .",
    "thus , the tutte polynomial of a rank-@xmath1 sparse matroid @xmath2 with @xmath42 elements and @xmath43 circuit  hyperplanes is given by @xmath44    clearly , given a @xmath1-rank paving matroid @xmath2 with @xmath42 elements , we can obtain the uniform matroid @xmath17 by a sequence of relaxations from @xmath2 . if @xmath2 has @xmath43 circuits - hyperplanes , equation  ( [ eq : relajacion ] ) also gives  ( [ eq : sparse_paving ] ) .",
    "another easy formula that we can obtained from the above definition involves the free extension , @xmath45 , of a matroid @xmath0 by an element @xmath46 , which consists of adding the element @xmath47 to @xmath2 as independently as possible without increasing the rank .",
    "equivalently , the rank function of @xmath48 is given by the following equations : for @xmath49 a subset of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 again , the tutte polynomial of @xmath45 can be computed easily from the tutte polynomial of @xmath2 by using equation  ( [ eq : expansion ] ) .",
    "@xmath53 here the trick is to notice that @xmath54 , where the sum is over all subsets of @xmath50 with @xmath55 , i.e. , spanning subsets of @xmath2 .",
    "the presentation given here is from  @xcite , but the formula can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "for example , the graphic matroid @xmath56 , has as free extention the matroid @xmath57 . because @xmath56 is sparse paving , by using  ( [ eq : sparse_paving ] ) , we can compute its the tutte polynomial and obtain @xmath58 now , by using  ( [ eq : free_expansion ] ) , we get the tutte polynomial of the free extension .",
    "@xmath59 this result can be check by using  ( [ eq : sparse_paving ] ) , as @xmath57 is also sparse paving .      in the second ( equivalent ) definition of the tutte polynomial",
    "we use a linear recursion relation given by deleting and contracting elements that are neither loops nor coloops .",
    "this is by far the most used method to compute the tutte polynomial .",
    "[ def : recursive ] if @xmath2 is a matroid , and @xmath47 is an element that is neither a loop nor a coloop , then @xmath60 [ end_recursion ] if @xmath47 is a coloop , then @xmath61 and if @xmath47 is a loop , then @xmath62    the proof that definition  [ definition ] and  [ def : recursive ] are equivalent can be found in  @xcite . from this",
    "it is clear that you just need the tutte polynomial of the matroid without loops and coloops . also ,",
    "if you know the tutte polynomial of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then you know the tutte polynomial of the matroid @xmath2 .",
    "this way of computing the tutte polynomial leads naturally to linear recursions .",
    "we present two examples where these linear recursions give formulas .      as a first example of this subsection we consider the graphic matroid @xmath66 . here , by deleting an edge @xmath47 from @xmath65 we obtained a path whose tutte polynomial is @xmath67 , while if we contract @xmath47 we get a smaller cycle @xmath68 .",
    "thus , as the tutte polynomial of the 2-cycle is @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70    by duality , the tutte polynomial of the graph @xmath71 with two vertices and @xmath42 parallel edges between them is @xmath72      as an almost trivial application of deletion - contraction we look into the common case when you have a graph or a matroid with parallel elements .",
    "let us define a _ parallel class _ in a matroid @xmath2 as maximal subset @xmath49 of @xmath73 such that any two distinct members of @xmath49 are parallel and no member of @xmath49 is a loop , see  @xcite .",
    "then the following result is well known and has been found many times , see  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath49 be a parallel class of a matroid @xmath2 with @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath49 is not a cocircuit , then @xmath75    the proof is by induction on @xmath76 with the case @xmath77 being  ( [ eq : deletion - contraction ] ) .",
    "the rest of the proof follows easily from the fact that each loop introduces a multiplicative factor of @xmath78 in the tutte polynomial .",
    "a _ series class _ in @xmath2 is just a parallel class in @xmath16 and by duality we get    let @xmath49 be an series class of a matroid @xmath2 with @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath49 is not a circuit , then @xmath79      the rectangular lattice , that we will define in a moment , is our first example where computing its tutte polynomial is really far from trivial and no complete answer is known .",
    "the interest resides probably in the importance of computing the potts partition function , which is equivalent to the tutte polynomial , of the square lattice",
    ". however , even a complete resolution of this problem will be just a small step towards the resolution of the really important problem of computing the tutte polynomial of the cubic lattice .",
    "let @xmath81 and @xmath42 be integers , @xmath82 . the _ grid _ or _ rectangular lattice _",
    "@xmath80 is a connected planar graph with @xmath83 vertices , such that its faces are squares , except one face that it is a polygon with @xmath84 edges .",
    "the grid graph @xmath80 can be represented as in figure  [ fig : grid_mxn ]    . ]",
    "the vertices of @xmath80 are denoted as ordered pairs , such that the vertex in the intersection of the row @xmath85 and the column @xmath86 is denoted by @xmath87 .",

    "the formulas are very complicated to use in practical calculations .",

    "for every positive integer @xmath42 .",
    "the graph @xmath93 is defined from the graph @xmath94 by contraction of the edge @xmath95 of @xmath94 . in particular , the graph @xmath96 is one isolated vertex , see figure  [ fig : first_terms ]     and the last three are from @xmath97 . ]     and the last three are from @xmath97 . ]    the initial conditions to construct the recurrence relations for the tutte polynomial of the grid graphs @xmath94 are :    1 .",

    "@xmath100    the third condition is true because the graph @xmath91 is isomorphic to the cycle @xmath101 , so we can use equation  ( [ eq : c_n ] ) .",
    "the formula for the recurrence relation to calculate the tutte polynomial of the graphs @xmath94 is : @xmath102    from this , we get a linear recurrence of order two , @xmath103 that is easy to solve . thus , the general formula is @xmath104 for @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 are @xmath110\\ ] ]    a _ recursive family of graphs _ @xmath111 is a sequence of graphs with the property that the tutte polynomials @xmath112 satisfy a linear homogeneous recursion relation in which the coefficients are polynomials in @xmath113 and @xmath78 with integral coefficients , independent of m , see  @xcite .",
    "so , the sequence @xmath114 is such a family and in general , @xmath115 , for a fixed @xmath116 , is a recursive family .",
    "probably the most common class of matroids , when evaluations of the tutte polynomial are considered , are graphic matroids . if @xmath2 is the graphic matroid of a graph @xmath117 , then deleting an element @xmath47 from @xmath2 amounts to deleting the corresponding edge from @xmath117 , and contracting @xmath47 to contracting the edge .",
    "this is easy to do in a small graph and by using definition  [ def : recursive ] you can compute the tutte polynomial .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : recursive ]        as we mentioned computing the tutte polynomial is not in general computationally tractable . however , for graphic matroids there are some resources to compute it for reasonably sized graphs of about 100 edges .",
    "these include sekine , imai , and tani  @xcite , which provides an algorithm to implement the recursive definition  [ def : recursive ] .",
    "common computer algebra systems such as maple and mathematica will compute the tutte polynomial for very small graphs , and there are also some implementations freely available on the web , such as http://ada.fciencias.unam.mx/~rconde/tulic/ by r. conde or http://homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~djp/tutte/ by g. haggard and d. pearce .    similarly , given a matroid @xmath0 , representable over a field @xmath118 , you can compute its tutte polynomial using deletion and contraction . for any element @xmath119 ,",
    "the matroids @xmath63 and @xmath64 are easily computed from the representation of @xmath2 , see  @xcite .",
    "this can be automatized and there are already computer programs that compute the tutte polynomial of a representable matroid . for our calculations",

    "now , in order to get a formula for the tutte polynomial of paving matroids , we need the following definition from  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath140 is an @xmath81-partition of @xmath50 , then @xmath140 is the set of hyperplanes of a paving matroid of rank @xmath141 on @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath142 , the set of hyperplanes of every rank-@xmath1 paving matroid on @xmath50 is an @xmath143-partition of @xmath50 .",
    "brylawski gives the following proposition in  @xcite , but we mentioned that his proof does not use activities .    [ prop : paving ] let @xmath2 be a rank-@xmath1 matroid with @xmath42 elements and tutte polynomial @xmath144 .",
    "then , @xmath2 is paving iff @xmath145 for all @xmath146 .",
    "in addition if the @xmath143-partition of @xmath50 has @xmath147 blocks of cardinality @xmath116 , for @xmath148 , then @xmath149 and for all @xmath150 , @xmath151    note that when @xmath2 is the uniform matroid @xmath17 , @xmath2 is a paving matroid with @xmath143-partition all subsets of size @xmath39 .",
