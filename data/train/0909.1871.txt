    "control of interaction strength between particles by utilizing a feshbach resonance makes it possible to form weakly bound molecules of two fermi particles with controllable binding energy  @xcite . with the help of this controllability , crossover between the usual bcs superfluid state to the bose - einstein condensation ( bcs - bec crossover )",
    "was observed in two - component fermi gases ( mixtures of two - hyperfine states )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the success in tuning interactions , optical lattices formed by standing waves of light also provide us with ideal systems to study various phenomena , such as the superfluid - mott insulator transition in bose systems  @xcite .",
    "this controllability of parameters makes ultracold atomic gases ideal model systems to investigate interacting many - body systems .",
    "since we can control both interaction strength and lattice potential depth , it is possible to realize any region of energy scales , such as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the interaction energy , @xmath3 is the energy of band gaps and @xmath4 is the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , we have a chance to study the interpolating region between solid state physics where @xmath5 usually stands and molecular physics where @xmath6 stands .",
    "the intermediate region @xmath7 is both complicated and interesting .",
    "this is because the interaction mixes two bands separated by the band gap and therefore orbital degrees of freedom play important roles . in this region , treating molecules as a fixed minimum unit is not justified because several different types of molecular bosons can be formed with different combinations of orbitals .",
    "internal degrees of freedom of bosons that are often considered in ultracold atomic gases are the spin degrees of freedom of hyperfine states .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that because of spin degrees of freedom of bosons , there can be several nontrivial phases  @xcite .",
    "however , roles of other types of freedom are rarely considered and remain open questions . in this paper , we highlight effects of orbital degrees of freedom arising from multi - band effects .    here , we first review an intriguing experiment with two - component fermi gases of @xmath8li done by zwierlein _ et al .",
    "_ under the condition with @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "they observed the superfluidity both in the bcs and in the bec sides with attractive interaction in optical lattices .",
    "we need to pay attention to the density of particles per unit cell @xmath9 . in this experiment ,",
    "the density of particles , @xmath9 is equal to two , which means that there is one particle of each component per unit cell on average .",
    "in this optical lattice , a band gap between the lowest and the second - lowest bands is nonzero under strong periodic lattice potentials .",
    "if the gap is nonzero and there is no interaction , we should obtain a band insulator . nevertheless , they observed the superfluidity for the lattice potential strong enough to form a band gap between the lowest and the second - lowest bands .",
    "in addition , they observed the disappearance of the superfluidity by strengthening the lattice potential .",
    "then , the authors claimed that it was a transition between the superfluidity and the mott insulator of _ molecular bosons_.    considering the experimental condition , however , we conclude that they observed the transition between a band insulator and a superfluid state .",
    "the reasons are the following .",
    "the added attractive interaction was about @xmath10 $ ] estimated from ref .",
    "@xcite , while the critical band gap where the superfluidity vanished was about @xmath11 $ ] estimated using our model shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : bi - sf ] .",
    "the energy cost to add one fermion to the insulator was @xmath11 $ ] while the energy cost to add a pair of fermions to the insulator was @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this means that low - energy excitations are fermionic rather than bosonic ones .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to conclude that the transition observed by zwierlein _",
    "_ is the band insulator - superfluid transition .",
    "this transition occurs in the case where @xmath7 stands . since this condition is hardly realized in electron systems and is not fully studied , unexpected mechanisms or phenomena as well as internal degrees of freedom of molecular bosons may play important roles .",
    "some theoretical works suggested possible insulator - superfluid transitions caused by the attractive interactions  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , little is known on the character of the transition and on properties of phases around the transition point with thermal effects .",
    "therefore , detailed analyses on the transition are desired . how the mott insulator of _ molecular bosons _ emerges is also an interesting open question .    in this paper",
    ", we first focus on a case with attractive interaction between @xmath13-components and @xmath14-components ( we call two hyperfine states @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , which we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : bi - sf ] .",
    "this condition is realized by utilizing a feshbach resonance as in the experiment by zwierlein _",
    "et al . _",
    "we show that the band insulator - superfluid transition is characterized by a remarkable feature that the superfluid gap is not scaled by the superfluid order parameter and is already large in contrast to the order parameter growing from zero in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "furthermore , the binding energy of a cooper pair near the transition point is large enough that a cooper pair is considered as a molecular boson .",
    "thus , this transition is characterized by a transition between the band insulator and the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "these features were mentioned in refs .",
    "in addition , with decreasing temperatures , a reentrant transition into the non - ordered phase appears .",
    "it is also illuminative to compare this emergence of the superfluidity with a completely different and extreme case of simple one - component bosonic atoms . in atomic bose gases with optical lattices , the binding interactions which stabilize bosons ,",
    "namely bose atoms are nuclear or electron - nuclei coulomb interactions , which are much stronger than the lattice potential . in comparison with the interaction scales in the first system ( interacting fermions ) ,",
    "the attractive interactions stabilizing atoms are strong enough , where the system shows the superfluidity .",
    "nevertheless , in bose systems , there exists an insulator , namely the mott insulator in optical lattices , if the repulsive interaction between bosons is enhanced .",
    "the emergence of the mott insulator of _ molecular bosons _ was claimed in previous works  @xcite .",
    "they claimed that the mott insulator emerges from the band insulator by a crossover .",
    "however , it is not a simple problem . in a mott state ,",
    "repulsive interaction is needed to stabilize the insulating phase .",
    "the repulsive interaction between molecular bosons in attractive fermi systems is caused only when molecules have a spatial extension , which is scaled by the @xmath15-wave scattering length between opposite components of fermi gases @xmath16  @xcite and becomes negligible in the limit of bose atoms .",
    "this means that the mott insulator of _ molecular bosons _ does not exist in the strong coupling limit ( the limit of bose atoms ) in attractive fermi systems .",
    "therefore , the mott insulator is possible only when the spatial extension or finite interaction range of the molecular boson comes into play .",
    "we then need to introduce repulsive interaction between molecules caused by its spatial extension to find the mott insulator .",
    "in fact , the mott insulator of bose atoms such as two - dimensional @xmath17he on the periodic potential of the substrate can be realized through van der waals repulsive interaction which indeed requires the finite range interaction of extended molecules .",
    "to realize these conditions , we introduce the second model , where one @xmath15-wave feshbach resonance between the opposite components and two @xmath18-wave feshbach resonances  @xcite , one for the  @xmath13-@xmath13 \" channel and the other for the  @xmath14-@xmath14 \" channel , are assumed .",
    "it is easy to realize that the repulsive interactions are mimicking repulsive ( van der waals ) interactions in the bose atom limit .",
    "such a system may be realized in experiments , though it is difficult so far because of large losses of atoms around resonance points .",
    "in addition to feshbach resonances induced by magnetic fields which are widely used in experiments , optical feshbach resonances  @xcite and feshbach resonances induced by dc electric fields  @xcite are , in principle , available simultaneously . with the help of combinations of three different feshbach resonances , it is possible to tune several interactions .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : mi - mb ] that one candidate for the mott insulator of _ molecular bosons _ which is associated with the boson mott insulator emerges in this system in the form of an orbital ordered insulator ( ooi ) in the mean - field theory .",
    "the ooi is caused by the orbital internal degrees of freedom of molecular bosons .",
    "if we assume that all the molecular bosons are the same kind , these typical internal degrees of freedom do not exist .",
    "we also investigate the case where the density of particles deviates from @xmath19 and find a new phase where superfluidity and orbital order coexist also emerges . in this phase ,",
    "the insulating and the superfluid particles show a sharp differentiation in momentum space .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bi - sf ] , we focus on the case with attractive interaction . setting the density of particles per site as @xmath19 , we clarify the origin of the band insulator - superfluid transition and reveal the characteristic properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mi - mb ] , we discuss the case where there is a repulsive interaction between the same components of fermions coexisting with an attractive interaction between the same components .",
    "if the attractive interaction between the opposite component becomes strong , this system is categorized as a bose gas with repulsive interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] , we summarize the results and discuss future problems .",
    "let us consider two - component fermi gases loaded in optical lattices .",
    "both components are assumed to have the same mass @xmath20 and the interaction between the opposite components is tuned via the feshbach resonance . since a lattice potential is induced by standing waves of light , the 3d lattice potential with the simple cubic symmetry has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a wave number of light , @xmath23 is the recoil energy defined as @xmath24 , and the coefficient @xmath25 is a constant which can be controlled by tuning the intensity of light .",

    "we first transform the hamiltonian into momentum space by the fourier transformation , such that @xmath31 substituting eq.([eq : ft ] ) into the kinetic term of the hamiltonian yields @xmath32 here @xmath33 has a finite value only when one of @xmath34 equals to @xmath35 , the length of the unit reciprocal vector , and the others vanish . by this transformation",

    "leads to the lattice hamiltonian @xmath38 where the superscript @xmath39 represents the band index and @xmath40 expresses the band dispersion energy , which is a function of the lattice potential depth @xmath25 . differing from the single - band hubbard model , this lattice hamiltonian contains more than one band because we consider not only the weak coupling but also the strong coupling regions , where the energy scale of the interaction strength is larger than that of the band gap . in this hamiltonian",

    "the coefficient of the quartic term is definitely real and positive , while the quadratic term changes the sign as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "this is a typical feature of the second - order transition in the landau expansion , which is consistent with the behavior of the order parameter shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] .",
    "this expansion is justified because the chemical potential is located in the band gap near the transition point , which means that all @xmath77 are not equal to zero .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical value of interaction @xmath78 is roughly estimated as follows : let us consider the energy required to excite a pair of fermions from the lower to the higher band . if there is no interaction between the particles , the energy is equal to twice the energy of the band gap , namely @xmath79 . however , with the interaction , the energy is modified to about @xmath80 .",
    "this is because the pair in the second - lowest band gains @xmath81 from the bcs channel which is prohibited by pauli principle in the band insulator . at sufficiently large @xmath30 ,",
    "some configurations lower the energy than that of the band insulator . from this insight",

    "since both the band insulating and the superfluid states should show gapped dos , it is worth investigating the transition of dos over the transition . in our calculation ,",
