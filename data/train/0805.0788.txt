    "recently , it has been theoretically demonstrated @xcite and experimentally verified @xcite that the onsager - casimir reciprocity relations @xcite can not be , in general , extended to mesoscopic transport far from equilibrium . departures of microreversibility at equilibrium have been related to the interaction of the nanostructure with an environment driven out of equilibrium.@xcite in both cases , it is found that the current flowing through the system is not invariant under reversal of the external magnetic field , leading to the observation of _ magnetoasymmetries _ solely due to the asymmetric properties of the internal electrostatic potential .",
    "thus , the effect is induced purely by electron interactions .",
    "previous literature has discussed the size of the magnetoasymmetries for the electric conductance . here , we are concerned with the _ shot noise _ , which is known to offer a complementary and , quite often , unique tool to probe electronic transport in quantum correlated nanostructures.@xcite shot noise has been shown to reveal electronic entanglement detection in mesoscopic interferometers,@xcite dynamical spin blockade in dots attached to ferromagnetic leads,@xcite quantum shuttling in nanoelectromechanical systems,@xcite nonequilibrium lifetime broadenings in cotunneling currents,@xcite and quantum coherent coupling in double quantum dots,@xcite just to mention a few .",
    "it is worth noting that the linear conductance and the equilibrium noise are related each other via the linear fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which is a general statement about the response of a system near equilibrium and its dynamical fluctuations induced by random forces.@xcite for mesoscopic conductors the theorem is expressed as the johnson - nyquist formula between equilibrium current fluctuations and the linear conductance.@xcite both the linear conductance and the current fluctuations at equilibrium obey reciprocity relations.@xcite at nonequilibrium , however , onsager s microreversibility is generally not fulfilled .",
    "notably , our calculations explicitly show an _ exact _ relation between both magnetoasymmetries corresponding to the noise susceptibility and the nonlinear conductance to leading order in the applied voltage bias , implying a higher - order fluctuation - dissipation relationship .",
    "recent works @xcite find similar fluctuation relations .",
    "we show our result considering a simple but paradigmatic mesoscopic system  a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime for which the charge is quantized and transport is blocked at low temperature unless charging energy is supplied by external voltage.@xcite we study a dot coupled to two chiral states @xcite ( filling factor @xmath0 ) propagating along the opposite edges of a quantum hall conductor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsample ] . for positive magnetic fields @xmath1 carriers in the upper ( lower ) edge state move from the left ( right ) terminal to the right ( left ) terminal .",
    "the current flow is reversed for @xmath2 .",
    "coupling between the dot and the edge states takes place via tunnel couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 and capacitive couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we consider a single energy level @xmath7 which can be externally tuned with a gate voltage .",
    "( @xmath7 is a kinetic energy invariant under @xmath8 reversal ) .",
    "the dot lies deep in the coulomb - blockade regime for which @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) is well above the electrochemical potentials @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) of both left ( @xmath13 ) and right ( @xmath14 ) leads , @xmath15 being the common fermi energy .",
    "we assume that each edge state is in equilibrium with its corresponding injecting reservoir .",
    "therefore , they act effectively as massive electrodes with well defined electrochemical potentials . without loss of generality , we take @xmath16 with @xmath17 the applied bias voltage .    for temperatures @xmath18 and",
    "voltages low enough , @xmath19 ( but @xmath18 sufficiently high to neglect kondo correlations ) , the charging energy @xmath20 is the dominant energy scale of the problem and double occupation in the dot is negligible . in the master equation approach , the charging state of the dot is given by an integer number of electrons , @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that quantum coherence between states with differing @xmath21 is lost , as occurs in the pure coulomb blockade regime . for definiteness , we consider spin polarized carriers , although the model can be easily extended to the spinful case .",
    "thus , the dot can be either in the empty state ( @xmath22 ) or in the occupied state ( @xmath23 ) with instantaneous occupation probability @xmath24 at time @xmath25 .",
    "the main transport mechanism is via single - electron tunneling ( @xmath26 ) and we can write quantum rate equations for @xmath27 and @xmath28,@xcite    @xmath29    in a more compact form , one has @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the vector with components @xmath32 and the @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) .",
    "we note that the columns of @xmath34 add to zero to fulfill the condition @xmath35 at every instant of @xmath25 .",
    "the elements of @xmath34 represent transition rates , @xmath36 , to tunnel on ( @xmath37 ) and off the dot ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the total rates are given by @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath1 we find ( see fig .",
    "[ figsample ] ) @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] where the occupation factors are given by @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the electrochemical potential in the dot , @xmath46 , is self - consistently found from the electrostatic configuration , which depends on the @xmath8 direction.@xcite for @xmath1 , one has @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath2 the chirality of the edge states is inverted and the nonequilibrium ( @xmath48 ) polarization charge changes accordingly . injected electrons in the upper ( lower ) edge state",
    "are now predominantly emitted from lead @xmath14 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , the rates now read @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] , where @xmath53 .",
    "we stress that the rates depend , quite generally , on the @xmath8 direction and differ for @xmath54 . as demonstrated in ref .",
    ", the magnetoasymmetry of the polarization charge leads to a magnetoasymmetric addition energy of the quantum dot and , as a result , the current average is an uneven function of @xmath8 .",
    "we can thus ask ourselves whether the current fluctuations also exhibit this effect .",
    "current fluctuations are characterized by the power spectrum , @xmath55 , of the current  current correlation function,@xcite @xmath56\\,dt \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the averaged current across the @xmath58 junction .",
    "its stationary value can be found from the steady state solution of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) , which reads @xmath59 and @xmath60 . as a consequence , @xmath61=e \\frac{\\gamma_\\alpha^+\\gamma^--\\gamma_\\alpha^-\\gamma^+}{\\gamma}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 .",
    "the correlator @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_sn ] ) can be obtained from the conditional probability @xmath64 that the state @xmath21 is occupied at time @xmath65 when the dot was in the state @xmath66 at @xmath67 . within our scheme",
    "the quantum regression theorem holds , and @xmath64 obeys the same equations as @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the eigenvalues of @xmath34 completely determine the dynamical behavior of @xmath68 .",
    "this can be seen from the noise expression @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the schottky noise produced by correlated tunneling through a single junction and @xmath71 g_{\\frac{1-\\epsilon'}{2},\\epsilon}(\\omega ) \\,,\\ ] ] where the `` green function '' matrix for eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) reads , @xmath72 care must be taken with the @xmath73 limit since @xmath34 is singular .",
    "the matrix @xmath34 has two eigenvalues , namely , @xmath74 with an eigenvector given by the stationary solution @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which describes a charge excitation in the system .",
    "therefore , we can now use in eq .",
    "( [ eq_g ] ) the spectral decomposition @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a matrix with the element @xmath79 equal to 1 and the other elements are zeroes , the @xmath80-th column of @xmath81 being the @xmath80-th eigenvector of @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath82 contribution cancels out the term @xmath83 . as a result , @xmath84",
    "and we find the shot noise @xmath85 at @xmath73 , @xmath86 for @xmath1 and large bias such that @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . substituting these values in eq .",
    "( [ eq_noise0 ] ) we recover the double barrier case for noninteracting electrons , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows results for the averaged current @xmath94 and the fano factor @xmath95 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the current is exponentially suppressed at low @xmath17 , increases at @xmath96 and reaches the limit value @xmath97 for large voltages .",
    "when @xmath8 is reversed , the current now increases at @xmath98 .",
    "since we choose @xmath99 the @xmath100 is shifted to larger voltages compared to @xmath101 . as a consequence ,",
    "the differential conductance is generally @xmath8-asymmetric .",
    "the fano factor is poissonian at small @xmath17 since transport is dominated by thermal activated tunneling . for increasing @xmath17 ,",
    "the noise becomes sub - poissonian and reaches saturation for large @xmath17 .",
    "the crossover step from poissonian noise to sub - poissonian noise has a width which depends on @xmath18 . like the current , the crossover center shifts to larger voltages when @xmath8 is reversed , thus yielding a magnetoasymmetric fano factor .    since the fano factor depends on both the noise and the current and these are asymmetric under @xmath8 reversal , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the magnetic field asymmetry for the noise alone , which we define as @xmath102/2 $ ] .",
    "the asymmetry vanishes for small @xmath17 , fulfilling the onsager symmetry . at large @xmath17",
    "the noise saturation value is independent of the @xmath8 direction since this limit corresponds to noninteracting fermions . as a result , the asymmetry vanishes .",
    "the asymmetry becomes maximal for intermediate voltages .",
    "importantly , the asymmetry increases with the capacitance asymmetry , @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the current fluctuations are magnetoasymmetric only in the case where the electrostatic coupling of the dot with the edge states leads to an asymmetric screening of charges .",
    "furthermore , we consider the case of low voltages , @xmath104 .",
    "then , we can expand @xmath105 and @xmath106 in powers of @xmath17 , @xmath107 we have checked that both the linear conductance @xmath108 and the equilibrium noise @xmath109 are even functions of @xmath8 .",
    "they satisfy the _ linear _ fluctuation dissipation theorem , @xmath110 .",
    "while @xmath108 depends on the equilibrium potential in the dot , the nonlinear conductance term @xmath111 is , in general , a function of the screening electrostatic potential.@xcite this potential need not be @xmath8-symmetric.@xcite thus , the magnetoasymmetry @xmath112/2 $ ] acquires a finite value : @xmath113 for high @xmath114 , eq .",
    "( [ phig2 ] ) yields @xmath115 since thermal fluctuations are @xmath8-symmetric .",
    "@xmath116 determines the rate at which the current magnetoasymmetry increases with voltage , thus showing that magnetoasymmetries are a truly nonequilibrium effect .    the nonequilibrium noise at linear response [ i.e. , @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) ] is also @xmath8-asymmetric . to leading order in @xmath17",
    ", we find @xmath118 where @xmath119/2 $ ] .",
    "this is a relevant result of our work .",
    "remarkably , we obtain the same functional dependence for the magnetoasymmetries of noise and current in the leading - order nonlinearities .",
    "we numerically confirm this prediction for a small value of @xmath17 ( see inset of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this result can be related to the _ nonlinear _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which reads @xmath120 .",
    "it has been derived in ref . for mesoscopic conductors at arbitrary voltages within the framework of full counting statistics .",
    "thus , it is shown@xcite that the nonlinear fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds even for interacting particles assuming time - reversibility ( no magnetic fields ) . the nontrivial difference , however , is that in our theory microreversibility is broken due to the combined effect of magnetic fields and interactions @xcite but still eq .",
    "( [ eqs1g2 ] ) holds .",
    "while detailed balance conditions are shown to hold far from equilibrium in the absence of magnetic fields,@xcite the same relations can not , generally , be established when microreversibility is broken.@xcite despite this , we obtain an unexpected symmetry relation between the conductance and noise response magnetoasymmetries .",
    "we note in passing that eq .",
    "( [ eqs1g2 ] ) is not a generalized of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for which nonlinear fluctuations and the response are related via a ( nontrivial ) effective temperature , as in glassy systems , @xcite since the prefactor for both linear and nonlinear theorems is the same .",
    "our result also differs from more general fluctuation theorems obeyed by full probability distributions.@xcite    to analyze higher - order terms one should consider fluctuations of the screening potential , which are beyond the scope of a mean - field approximation",
    ". nevertheless , for classical coulomb blockade effects the local potential fully screens the excess charges and quantum fluctuations are absent .",
    "therefore , our model system is perfectly suitable for further extensions .",
    "we note that the fano factor magnetoasymmetry , @xmath121/2 $ ] , is _",
    "quadratic _ in voltage : @xmath122    a complete characterization of current fluctuations is given by the full counting statistics,@xcite which yields the entire probability distribution @xmath123 of the transferred charge during the measurement time @xmath124 .",
    "we follow the method of bagrets and nazarov @xcite to assess the cumulant generating function @xmath125 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we count charges in the @xmath14 lead .",
    "therefore , we make the substitutions @xmath126 and @xmath127 in the off - diagonal elements of @xmath34 and @xmath128 is derived from @xmath129 .",
    "we calculate @xmath123 within the saddle - point approximation , valid in the limit @xmath130 @xcite and determine the magnetoasymmetry of @xmath123 .",
    "we show @xmath131/2 $ ] in fig .",
    "@xmath132 increases for increasing capacitance asymmetry and vanishes around @xmath133 .",
    "this point corresponds to the mean current @xmath134 for a dot symmetrically coupled ( @xmath135 ) in the limit @xmath136 .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated magnetoasymmetric current fluctuations of a coulomb - blockaded quantum dot . it is well established that the linear fluctuation - dissipation theorem makes an equivalence between linear - response functions to small perturbations and correlation functions describing fluctuations due to electric motion . in this work ,",
    "we have found a similar fluctuation - dissipation relation that predicts an exact equivalence between the leading - order rectification and noise magnetoasymmetries , valid in the presence of external magnetic fields .",
    "such relation has been very recently shown to derive from fundamental principles.@xcite moreover , we have shown that the full probability distribution associated to the flow of charges is , generally , magnetic - field asymmetric .",
    "since the effect studied here relies purely on interaction , it should be observable in many other systems exhibiting strong charging effects .",
