    "while much of this work has focused on the hubbard or @xmath4-@xmath5 model , a simpler case to understand is that of the spatially anisotropic square - lattice spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet , @xmath6 ( and see fig .",

    "the essential question is whether nel order sets in for infinitesimal @xmath8 or whether there is a finite minimum coupling ratio necessary for long range order ( lro ) .",

    "[ sec : ser_calc ] we present such a numerical investigation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) based on high order series expansion about both the nel and dimer phases . that analysis seems to indicate that if there is a critical ratio it is rather small .",
    "spin - wave theory plays an important role in our understanding of antiferromagnetism . a systematic @xmath10 expansion ( where @xmath11 is the spin magnitude ) is generally believed to give , in low orders , a fairly accurate estimate of the sublattice magnetization on various lattices . in particular , it correctly predicts the absence of long range order at @xmath1 for a one - dimensional antiferromagnet .",

    "nonetheless , we might be tempted to believe the conclusion that it does occur at @xmath1 .",
    "a more sensible application of this mean field theory for @xmath42 is to the case of a staggered intra - chain coupling at @xmath1 ( see sec .  [",

    "the value of the 2d effective coupling , when the cut - off has been reduced to @xmath65 , then acts as the initial condition for further rg calculations : as we lower the cut - off still further we should use the isotropic 3d rg equations using @xmath67 as the initial value . in the limit @xmath68 , the 2d coupling flows to its zero - cutoff fixed point , @xmath69 .",

    "the important question is whether or not @xmath76 .",
    "if it is , then an arbitrarily weak inter - plane coupling leads to order for all @xmath77 . in the other case ,",
    "if @xmath78 , then there will be some special temperature , @xmath79 , such that below this temperature an arbitrarily weak inter - plane coupling leads to lro but above this temperature there is a minimum inter - plane coupling necessary for lro .",
    "numerical simulations of the classical layered @xmath51 model indicate that @xmath76 @xcite . in this case",
    "the present approach predicts a critical coupling , @xmath80 , for weakly coupled planes , slightly above @xmath81 .",
    "this can be estimated as the bare coupling for which the renormalized coupling at scale @xmath82 , @xmath83 . using the 2d kosterlitz renormalization group equations",
    "this gives : @xmath84 in agreement with estimates based on plane mean field theory @xcite and another approach @xcite somewhat closer in spirit to the present one .",
    "now let us consider the half - integer spin quantum heisenberg chain @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional @xmath53-model action now has an extra topological term added to it , with topological angle @xmath19 .",
    "this angle itself does not renormalize , for symmetry reasons , but it has a crucial effect on the renormalization of @xmath85 .",
    "there is now a finite coupling critical point , @xmath69 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgflow ] .",
    "( the strong coupling phase is spontaneously dimerized ; it can be reached with a sufficiently strong antiferromagnetic second nearest neighbor coupling . )",
    "the three - dimensional rg flows are expected to be the same for both integer and half - integer spin , although the nature of the disordered phase may depend on whether the spin is half - integer , odd integer or even integer , due to a berry s phase topological term @xcite .",
    "we assume the only important effect of the topological terms is to produce a finite @xmath69 critical point in two dimensions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgflow ] .",
    "the situation is then similar to the classical @xmath51 case . whether or not a disordered phase occurs for weak interchain coupling depends on whether or not @xmath86 .",
    "let us contrast this approach to either of those discussed above , in secs .",
    "[ sec : swt ] and [ sec : cmft ] . first consider the calculation of the breakdown of the nel state in lowest order spin - wave theory .",
    "this can be regarded as the above calculation of the renormalization of the 2d coupling , using _ only the lowest order 2d rg equations_. for large @xmath11 we begin with a very small bare coupling .",
    "however , the lowest order rg equations always break down for small enough @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , these equations do not distinguish integer and half - integer @xmath11 . in @xmath53-model language ,",
    "the lowest order rg is independent of the topological term .",
    "actually the rg equations are independent of it to all orders in @xmath58 ; its effects are exponentially small in @xmath58 .",
    "nonetheless , for small enough @xmath9 we always renormalize into the regime where these non - perturbative contributions are important .",
    "blind use of the lowest order equations essentially leads to the conclusion that @xmath69 is infinite and hence that the system is disordered at small enough @xmath9 .    on the other hand",
    "consider the standard mean field argument @xcite . because the 2d susceptibility is divergent along the whole kt critical line , or in the heisenberg case with topological term",
    ", it predicts lro in all these cases .",
    "we argue that in order to go beyond a mean field treatment one should consider not the 2d susceptibility but rather the renormalized 2d effective coupling .",
    "naively if the 2d susceptibility is infinite , the 2d effective coupling is zero .",
    "but in fact , this is not actually the case .",
    "since the 2d effective coupling is finite at zero cut - off we must consider whether or not it is below @xmath70 , leading to the above conclusion .",
    "it was suggested recently by parola _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite that , for @xmath9 less than a finite @xmath2 , the long wavelength behavior `` can be interpreted in terms of decoupled one dimensional chains . ''",
    "the implausibility of this proposal can be seen by considering a finite number of chains . in this case",
    ", we can analyze the scaling behavior entirely in terms of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional renormalization group .",
    "the inter - chain coupling , of dimension 1 , is relevant .",
    "we might then naively expect from standard scaling arguments that for two chains there should be a gap , proportional to @xmath9 ( up to logarithms ) .",
    "the existence of a gap in this case has been shown numerically @xcite . in the case of three chains , white _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite found that the gap appears to vanish and this has been argued to be the case for any odd number of chains . however , this does not necessarily mean that the system asymptotically behaves like decoupled chains .",
    "indeed , it seems more likely that the low energy states would be those of a _ single _ @xmath0 chain .",
    "this assertion is motivated by the behavior of a single spin @xmath11 chain as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "for integer @xmath11 one expects a gap while for half - integer @xmath11 one expects universal gapless behavior which is independent of @xmath11 ( _ i.e. _ , always in the free boson or @xmath87 wess - zumino - witten universality class ) . for half - integer @xmath11 the density of low - lying excitations ( after scaling out the spin - wave velocity ) _ does not increase _ with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "we may expect similar behavior for @xmath88 coupled spin-@xmath46 chains : inter - chain coupling is relevant and the system scales away from decoupled chains to the single chain fixed point with fewer gapless degrees of freedom .",
    "note that in this case , the number of low - lying degrees of freedom does not scale with the area of the system but only with the length .",
    "it is of course possible that , as the number of chains is increased , the gap to other excitations decreases and asymptotically approaches zero as the number of chains goes to @xmath89 .",
    "indeed , this must happen if the @xmath89-chain system nel orders . however , it then seems unlikely that the low - lying excitations would be those of decoupled chains .",
    "we rather expect that , if a disordered phase exists at small @xmath9 , it has a genuinely 2-dimensional nature .",
    "previous work on the isotropic @xmath0 square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet with next - nearest neighbor interactions suggests that a dimer - ordered ground state is the most likely to occur in a magnetically disordered phase @xcite .",
    "however , other possibilities with or without a gap can not be ruled out .",
    "actually , the result of our reasoning is pretty uninformative .",
    "it is simply that we can not tell from rg arguments whether or not the system orders for arbitrarily weak inter - plane coupling , in cases where the 2d system has an infinite correlation length .",
    "we might expect that the existence or non - existence of a critical @xmath9 is not universal .",
    "different realizations of the model may have different values of @xmath70 or @xmath69 , since critical temperatures ( or couplings ) are in general not universal .",
    "for instance , a different phase diagram might ensue if the chains are coupled with a first and second nearest neighbor inter - chain coupling , both proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "it would thus seem that the question of the existence of a disordered phase for finite @xmath9 in a particular model must be answered by numerical work .",
    "we now turn to numerical studies of weakly coupled , @xmath0 heisenberg chains , and in particular the anisotropic two - dimensional lattice of fig .  [ fig : lattice ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "it is obviously not possible for any numerical calculation to distinguish between @xmath90 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the persistence of nel order for arbitrarily small interchain couplings , and a sufficiently small but positive @xmath91 . provided that there is no strong evidence for any particular nonzero value of @xmath91 , the best one can do is argue that numerical data are consistent with a vanishing @xmath91 and offer reasonable upper bounds on its value .",
    "our numerical studies consist of a variety of zero - temperature series expansions ( _ i.e. , _ rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory ) following the cluster - expansion techniques described in ref .  14",
    ". series expansions have several advantages over finite - size calculations in two - dimensional lattice quantum many - body problems .",
    "there is no need to worry about cluster - shape effects  which should be of particular concern in anisotropic models such as the one of present interest . given comparable computing power ,",
    "series calculations can account for much further - range correlations than would be possible in an exact diagonalization calculation ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "v of ref .  14 ) .",
    "finally , the fact that the series calculations do not directly study the model of interest , but rather yields results on a one ( or more ) parameter family of models , may allow for further informative comparisons with approximate analytic calculations .",
    "expansions were carried out about both ising and dimer hamiltonians .",
    "the calculations and analyses will be described in detail below ; here let us preview the results .",
    "the results of both types of expansions are consistent with @xmath90 .",
    "we believe that @xmath91 is unlikely to exceed @xmath92 .",

    "[ fig : simplest_phase_diagrams](b ) were to hold . as a partial test of the reliability of the series estimates of @xmath138",
    ", we have considered the problem of _ two _ coupled chains by the dimer series expansion method .",
    "the chains were taken to lie parallel to the bonds in the columnar dimer configuration .",
    "the only differences between these calculations and those preceding are the set of connected clusters ( and their lattice constants ) , and that we will present results for @xmath163 rather than @xmath144 .",
    "( in fact one can use @xmath163 to estimate @xmath138 for the plane of chains as well ; the differences between the estimates based on @xmath163 and @xmath144 are insignificant for the @xmath20 of interest . )    for two chains the only critical point in the @xmath44-@xmath20 plane is @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "estimates of @xmath138 coming from inhomogeneous differential approximants to the @xmath134 and @xmath163 series for two chains are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : twochains ] , on the same scale as in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_planestuff ] for ease of comparison .",
    "the thick solid and thin dotted - dashed curves are the chain and dimer mean field results , respectively , for _ two _ chains .",
    "( one obtains these from the mean field results for planes of chains by the substitution @xmath165 . )",
    "several points are evident upon inspection .",
    "first , even at very small @xmath20 one can distinguish between the estimates of @xmath145 from the differential approximants for the plane of chains and for two chains ; they seem to approach zero with different slopes , on these plots . this could be taken as further evidence that , for the plane of chains , @xmath91 is extremely small if not vanishing .",
    "however , for @xmath166 , where the approximants are well - converged , one might conclude that there are critical points at @xmath167 , contrary to the known behavior of coupled pairs of chains .",
    "we believe this line segment of `` pseudocritical '' points reflects the existence of local maxima in the correlation length at @xmath168 for fixed , small @xmath20 , where the correlation length at these maxima exceeds the typical cluster length in the seventh - order calculation ( which is roughly 10 ) . that such pseudocritical points should exist is entirely plausible : numerical studies for pairs of finite chains @xcite find that the gap initially _",
    "decreases _ as @xmath20 is increased from zero .",
    "what is somewhat disturbing is that , for @xmath169 , the two - chain approximants are as consistent with chain mean field theory ( for two chains ) as the plane - of - chain approximants are with chain mean field theory ( for a plane of chains ) .",
    "thus it is conceivable that for the plane of chains , the values of @xmath145 indicated by the series at sufficiently small @xmath20 are pseudocritical points , rather than true critical points , as well .",
    "to conclude , the problem of coupled chains at small @xmath20 poses significant challenges to numerical studies .",
    "although the series expansions are consistent with @xmath90 they do not rule out a small but positive @xmath91 . if the disordered phase exists , the correlation length along the @xmath170 direction is probably large throughout that phase , and the gap is everywhere small",
    ". a potentially fruitful avenue for future studies would be the consideration of models which include further - neighbor couplings ; suitable models would have larger critical interchain couplings within spin - wave theory than the simplest coupled heisenberg chain model studied here .",
