    "x - ray observations , beginning with the @xmath2 observatory , have demonstrated that normal early - type galaxies are x - ray emitters , with 0.24 kev luminosities ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( @xcite ; fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath0 is found to correlate with the blue luminosity @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) , but there is a large scatter of roughly two orders of magnitude in @xmath0 at any fixed @xmath6 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the observed x - ray spectra of galaxies with high @xmath7 ratios are consistent with thermal emission from hot , optically thin gas , while those of low @xmath7 objects can be mostly accounted for by emission from stellar sources ( kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath8 diagram has been recognized as the most striking feature of the x - ray properties of early - type galaxies . using new apparent magnitudes and fundamental plane distances",
    ", it was shown that this scatter is reduced by 20% , but not eliminated ( donnelly , faber & oconnell 1990 ; see fig .",
    "this result is based on the old estimate of the x - ray fluxes ( that of canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ) , and on just half of the final sample of x - ray galaxies produced by fabbiano et al .",
    "1992 ( see eskridge , fabbiano & kim 1995 for a detailed comparison of the statistical results by donnelly et al . with those obtained using the whole sample ) .",
    "one can argue that the large dispersion in @xmath9 is definitively not the result of distance errors on the basis of the fact that a scatter of the same size as in fig .",
    "1a is present even in the distance - independent diagram of @xmath7 versus the central stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. , eskridge et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "many theoretical models were developed to explain the findings above , including numerical simulations of the behavior of gas flows fed by stellar mass loss and heated by type ia supernovae ( snia ) .",
    "steady state cooling flow models were investigated first ( nulsen et al .",
    "1984 , @xcite,1988 ) , and it was found that these can only reproduce x - ray bright galaxies .",
    "evolutionary models with a snia rate approximately constant with time have been carried out by mathews & loewenstein ( 1986 ) , loewenstein & mathews ( 1987 ) , and david , forman , & jones ( 1990 , 1991 ) . after a very brief initial wind phase , driven by the explosion of type ii supernovae",
    ", the resulting flow evolution goes from a global inflow to a wind , which is experienced only by the smallest galaxies by the present time .",
    "david ( 1991 ) conclude that all galaxies above @xmath10 host a cooling flow .",
    "so , as in the steady state cooling flow scenario , the scatter in @xmath9 at fixed @xmath1 has to be explained by a combination of environmental differences ( @xcite ) and by large variations from galaxy to galaxy in the stellar mass loss rate per unit @xmath1 , the efficiency of thermalization of the stellar mass loss , and that of thermal instabilities in the hot gas .",
    "an alternative way of explaining the scatter in the @xmath8 diagram is given by the evolutionary scenario of dercole ( 1989 ) , and ciotti ( 1991 , cdpr ) .",
    "assuming that the snia explosion rate is declining with time slightly faster than the rate with which mass is lost by the stars , in the beginning the energy released by snia s can drive the gas out of the galaxies through a supersonic wind . as the collective snia energy input decreases , a subsonic outflow takes place , which gradually slows until a central cooling catastrophe leads to the onset of an inflow . at fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "any of the three phases wind , outflow or inflow can be found at the present epoch , depending only on the various depths and shapes of the potential well of the galaxies . in this way both",
    "the large scatter in @xmath9 and the trend in the spectral properties are accounted for at the same time : in the x - ray bright galaxies the soft x - ray emitting gas dominates the emission , being in the inflow phase , that resembles a cooling flow ; in the x - ray faint galaxies the hard stellar emission dominates , these being in the wind phase .",
    "recent @xmath11 observations seems to indicate that the snia s activity is suppressed in early - type galaxies , which implies that the cdpr scenario is essentially ruled out .",
    "since this issue is far from closed (  1.3 ) , it is still worthwile to explore the effects of snia s on the flows , using the updated rate given by recent optical surveys ; this is lower than that adopted by cdpr , which was 0.67 the standard one estimated by tammann ( 1982 ) .",
    "this aspect , together with the need for changes in other galaxy properties crucial for the evolution of hot gas flows , are discussed below .",
    "previous numerical simulations of hot gas flows used the king ( 1972 ) stellar density distribution mainly for computational ease .",
    "this distribution has an inner region of constant density ( the so called `` core '' ) of the order of a few hundred parsecs , which keeps the time step of the numerical simulation reasonably small ( a stellar density increase implies a reduction of the characteristic hydrodynamical time step ) .",
    "another advantage of density profiles with a constant density core is that the central regions can be resolved using a larger grid size ; this again allows a larger time step ( see cdpr for a more quantitative discussion ) .",
    "it is well known though that a much better description of the surface brightness profiles of ellipticals is given by the de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) law .",
    "a very good fit to this law is given by the jaffe ( 1983 ) and by the hernquist ( 1990 ) distributions , that have the advantage that all their dynamical properties can be expressed analytically .",
    "these distributions belong to the family of the so called @xmath12-models , that has been widely explored recently ( @xcite ; @xcite ) :    @xmath13    the density profile of the hernquist law has @xmath14 , while that of the jaffe law has @xmath15 .",
    "inside @xmath16 the density of @xmath12-models increases as @xmath17 , a significant difference with respect to king models : over a few hundreds of parsecs at the center the @xmath12-models are power laws .",
    "the existence of cores of constant surface brightness has been definitively ruled out by ground based observations ( lauer 1985 , kormendy 1985 ) , and recently by the hubble space telescope ( jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; @xcite ) , that has shown how the central surface brightness profile is described by a power law as far in as can be observed , i.e. , @xmath18 pc in virgo . from the point of view of a very accurate photometry , the surface brightness law implied by eq .",
    "( 1 ) can not reproduce well both the envelope and the very center of all the ellipticals observed by hst .",
    "the jaffe law , though , gives a general description of ellipticals accurate enough for the treatment of hot gas flows , on the scales that are relevant for the problem ( from a few tens to several thousands of parsecs ) .",
    "attempts to estimate the amount of nonluminous mass in elliptical galaxies have been made recently through extensive searches for dynamical evidence of dark matter , either with systematic observations of ionized gas probing the gravitational field ( @xcite ) or with measurements of stellar velocity dispersions profiles out to large radii ( e.g. , @xcite ; carollo et al .",
    "these optical studies are confined to within one or two effective radii @xmath19 , and typically find that luminous matter dominates the mass distribution inside @xmath20 , while dark matter begins to be dynamically important at 23 @xmath19 . in particular , for a sample of x - ray emitting galaxies , it has been found that dark matter halos are not much more massive than the luminous component , with the dark - to - luminous mass ratio @xmath21 ; the value of @xmath22 is most common ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray emission from hot gas provides a great potential for mapping the mass of ellipticals to larger distances ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "the standard method employed derives from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , and requires the knowledge of the gas temperature profile .",
    "attempts to apply this technique to the _ einstein _",
    "data yielded a much larger component of dark matter than found from optical data , but these results are very uncertain because temperature profiles are poorly determined ( forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; @xcite ) .",
    "using superior x - ray data provided by _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ , buote & canizares ( 1997 ) proved that mass does not follow the optical light , out to many @xmath19 , in ngc720 and ngc1332 . adopting plausible gas and mass models",
    ", they find @xmath23 for ngc1332 , and @xmath24 in ngc720 at 90% confidence ; @xmath25 prevails exterior to @xmath19 . similarly mushotzky ( 1994 ) derive @xmath26 within @xmath27 for ngc4636 , and analogous results have been obtained from _",
    "_ data of ngc507 and ngc499 by kim & fabbiano ( 1995 ) .",
    "_ axaf _ will have the combined spatial and spectral resolution to measure accurately the presence of different spectral components , their relative flux and their spatial distribution , and to produce more accurate mass distribution from x - rays .",
    "the radial density distribution of the dark haloes of ellipticals is not well constrained by observations ; theoretical arguments favor a peaked profile ( ciotti & pellegrini 1992 ; evans & collett 1997 ) , and high resolution numerical simulations of dissipationless collapse produce a density distribution with @xmath28 near the center ( @xcite ; navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ; @xcite ; fukushige & makino 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "previous works studying the hot gas flow evolution always used quasi isothermal haloes at least nine times more massive than the luminous component .",
    "we are motivated now to explore even the effects produced by dark haloes not as massive as supposed before , and not quasi - isothermal .",
    "nearby snia rates in early - type galaxies have been carefully reanalyzed recently , and this important ingredient of the simulations of hot gas flows has been revised . from optical surveys",
    "it was estimated to be 0.88@xmath29 snu ( @xcite ) , and then 0.98@xmath29 snu ( @xcite ) .",
    "most recent estimates agree on lower values : 0.25@xmath29 snu ( @xcite ) and 0.24@xmath29 snu ( turatto , cappellaro , & benetti 1994 ) , where @xmath30 and 1 snu = 1 snia per century per @xmath31 .    in principle , constraints on the snia rate can be given also by estimates of the iron abundance in galactic flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these were first attempted using data from the _ ginga _ satellite for ngc4472 , ngc4636 , ngc1399 ( ohashi 1990 ; awaki 1991 ; ikebe 1992 ) , and then from the _ bbxrt _ satellite for ngc1399 , ngc4472 ( @xcite ) , and more recently from _ asca _ with a superior spectral energy resolution ( @xcite ; awaki 1994 ; arimoto 1997 ; matsumoto et al . 1997 ) . under the assumption of solar abundance ratio",
    ", the analysis of all these data suggests a very low iron abundance , consistent with no snia s enrichment and even lower than that of the stellar component .",
    "however , some authors have found that more complex multi - temperature models with higher abundance give a better fit of the data ( @xcite , buote & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , the above results are based on iron line diagnostic tools whose reliability has been questioned ( e.g. , @xcite ) , especially because of uncertainties affecting the fe l - shell atomic physics for temperatures less than 2 kev , that are typical of hot gas flows in ellipticals ( liedahl , osterheld , & goldstein 1995 ) . line emission even in simple ( e.g. , isothermal ) astrophysical plasmas needs to be understood , and reliable fits to the data made , before secure consequences concerning the snia rate can be drawn from x - ray determined abundances .    in summary ,",
    "recent optical studies agree on a present epoch snia rate much lower than previously used , and indicate that also the dark matter content could be lower .",
    "moreover , cuspier density profiles , especially for the stellar distribution , should be used .",
    "all this raises the question of whether the cdpr scenario is altered by these changes in the main ingredients of the problem , and more in general what are the effects on the properties of hot gas flows . in this paper",
    "we address these points , with a new set of hydrodynamical simulations . in section 2",
    "we present the galaxy models , the source terms , and the integration techniques . in section 3",
    "we discuss the main properties of the evolution of gas flows in our new models , and we compare them with the observations and the cdpr results . in section 4",
    "we discuss the results using energetic arguments , and in section 5 the main conclusions are summarized .",
    "following the discussion in sections 1.1 and 1.2 , our model galaxies are a superposition of a jaffe density distribution for the luminous matter @xmath32 [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath15 ] , and of a hernquist distribution for the dark matter [ eq . ( 1 ) with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath14 ] .",
    "we call these two - component mass models jh models .",
    "both density distributions have finite mass , and so no truncation radius is applied .",
    "the relation between the scale length @xmath39 and the effective radius for the jaffe model is @xmath40 .",
    "we constrain the luminous body to lie on the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ) . the input observables are @xmath1 , and the central value of the projected velocity dispersion @xmath41 .",
    "the stellar mass is related to @xmath41 through the projected virial theorem , as described in ciotti , lanzoni , & renzini ( 1996 ) ; the luminous matter distribution is then completely defined , because it is assumed that the stellar mass - to - light ratio is constant with radius , and the orbital distribution is isotropic .",
    "the dark matter distribution is determined by choosing the ratios of the dark to luminous mass ( @xmath42 ) , and of the dark to luminous core radius ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the basic dynamical properties of the jh models ( radial trend of the velocity dispersion , kinetic and potential energy , etc . ) are given in the appendix .",
    "the time evolving input ingredients of the numerical simulations are the rates of stellar mass loss , of snia heating , and of thermalization of the stellar velocity dispersion ; these are calculated as in cdpr , where a detailed description is given . here we summarize only the main properties of the input quantities .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate is accurately described by @xmath44 , where @xmath1 is in @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is time in units of 15 gyr ; in the numerical code the exact mass return prescribed by the stellar evolution theory is used .",
    "the snia heating rate is parameterized as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 erg is the kinetic energy injected in the ism by one snia , @xmath49 snu , and @xmath50 . when @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 is the rate estimated by tammann ( 1982 )",
    "@xmath54 is assumed to be decreasing with time just faster than the stellar mass loss rate .",
    "unfortunately , given our enduring ignorance of the nature of the snia s progenitors ( e.g. , branch 1995 ) the evolution of the snia rate is not known ; some arguments though , as an observed pronounced correlation of the rate with the star formation rate along the hubble sequence , favour a declining rate ( see also renzini 1993 ; ruiz - lapuente , burkert , & canal 1995 ; renzini 1996 ) .",
    "with the assumptions above the specific heating for the gas is decreasing with time , and so we have the wind / outflow / inflow secular evolution in the cdpr models ( @xmath551 ) .",
    "this direction of the evolution of the flow is maintained as long as @xmath53 decreases faster than @xmath56 , and the results do not qualitatively depend on the particular slope adopted for @xmath53 ; when this slope is much higher than that of @xmath57 , though , too much iron is produced at early times ( see renzini 1993 for a more extensive discussion ) .    the heating given by the thermalization of the stellar velocity dispersion at each radius",
    "is determined using the velocity dispersion profile obtained by solving the jeans equation in the global isotropic case ( see the appendix )",
    ".      the time - dependent equations of hydrodynamics with source terms , and the numerical code used to solve them , are fully described in cdpr , together with the initial conditions .",
    "we adopt here a higher spatial resolution in the central regions of the galaxies : the central grid spacing is 30 pc instead of 100 pc .",
    "this allows a better sampling of the inner regions now described by a power law , and is adequate to highlight the differences in the flow properties between jh models and king models plus a quasi isothermal dark halo .",
    "the model galaxies are initially devoid of gas , a situation produced by the galactic winds established by type ii supernovae , early in the evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the gas flow evolution is followed for 15 gyrs .",
    "we present here the results of the hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the basic input parameters and output quantities are shown in table 1 .",
    "two representative blue luminosities have been used to investigate the typical gas flow behavior , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ; the corresponding @xmath60 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "various values of @xmath63 are chosen .",
    "@xmath64 is close to the most secure current estimate coming from optical surveys ( which is @xmath65 , see @xmath66 ) ; to consider the indications coming from the low iron abundances given by x - ray data ( @xmath551.2 ) , we also explore the case @xmath67 ; for comparison with the long - lived inflow case , we also use @xmath68 .",
    "the distribution of the dark mass is broader than that of the luminous mass ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) ; the dark mass prevails outside one or two @xmath19 if @xmath71 , or outside a few @xmath19 if @xmath72 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "a general feature of all the evolutionary sequences , except for those with @xmath73 , is to develop a _",
    "central _ inflow at early times , while the outer regions are still outgassing , i.e. , a decoupled gas flow ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the inflow region is bordered by a stagnation radius @xmath74 that may range from a small fraction of @xmath19 to many @xmath19 , at the end of the evolution ( see table 1 ) .",
    "if @xmath74 maintains its position within a few @xmath19 , we call the flow _ partial wind _ ( hereafter pw ; see the representative case in fig .  3 and 4 ) ; if it increases considerably to more than @xmath75 , we call the resulting flow global inflow , even though this is strictly the case only when @xmath73 . in the pw case ,",
    "radiative losses suppress an outflow in the inner parts of the galaxy , causing a small inflow region , but a wind can be sustained in the external parts , where the gas density is much lower and the gas is also less tightly bound .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of pws and inflows steadly decreases with time , following the decrease of @xmath57 and of the heating .",
    "note that the stagnation points resulting from the simulations are well outside the first grid point , so the flow is properly resolved .",
    "another general trend in the results is that , at fixed @xmath76 , as @xmath77 and/or @xmath78 decrease , the larger are the inflow region , @xmath0 , the mass accreted to the center @xmath79 , the mass flowing to the center per unit time @xmath80 , and the smaller is @xmath81 , the mass escaping the galaxy per unit time , because the heating is lower and/or the dark mass concentration is higher .      for @xmath82 , and @xmath83",
    ", these galaxies develop pws with @xmath74 varying from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath86 a global wind persists until the present time , and so @xmath0 is very low .",
    "even when @xmath64 the hot gas , in pw , shows such a low @xmath0 that the observed x - ray emission must be largely produced by the stellar sources , whose emission has been estimated to be of the order of @xmath87 ( see fig .  1 ) . when @xmath88 , the final @xmath89 , and the hot gas starts to dominate the x - ray emission of the galaxy .",
    "significantly higher @xmath0 values are obtained by increasing the gas temperature , not just by retaining more gas ; in fact the model with @xmath82 and @xmath73 , a global inflow that lasts for the whole galaxy lifetime , has just @xmath90 . to increase the gas temperature _ and _ @xmath0 , the dark matter content must be increased first , because global winds are obtained by just increasing the snia heating .",
    "a deeper potential well by itself produces hotter gas , because of a higher gravitational compression during the inflow ; moreover , it can be coupled to a larger inflow region , if @xmath77 is kept constant , or to a higher heating without full degassing if @xmath91 is increased .    for @xmath71 and @xmath92",
    "the gas is always in a global inflow at the present time .",
    "the highest @xmath93 is obtained when @xmath64 and @xmath69 , i.e. , when the heating by snia s and gravitational compression is the highest possible for the chosen ranges of these parameters .",
    "this @xmath0 is still lower than the highest @xmath0 observed at @xmath94 ( fig .  1 ) , a problem that was known also from previous works ( see the references cited in the introduction ) .",
    "however , @xmath0 as high as @xmath95 are comparable to those typical of poor clusters rather than single galaxies ; at least some of them could be explained with accretion effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    note that for pws ( @xmath82 ) @xmath0 is higher when @xmath77 is lower , because the inflow region is larger . for global inflows",
    "( @xmath96 ) @xmath0 is higher when @xmath77 is also higher , because the gas is hotter .",
    "altogether , the variation in @xmath0 in table 1 is a factor of @xmath97 ; it is of a factor of @xmath98 when @xmath82 , and just @xmath99 when @xmath96 .",
    "models with @xmath82 again develop pws , with quite larger central inflow regions than above for the same range of @xmath77 and @xmath78 values , due to a deeper potential well .",
    "the latter makes also the gas hotter .",
    "larger inflow regions and higher gas temperatures , coupled to a larger mass return rate , make the x - ray emission in these galaxies always higher than that of the models described in @xmath100 , for the same @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath0 goes from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , when the flow is a pw .",
    "so , it is always comparable to or higher than the estimate of the stellar x - ray emission at @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; this is in agreement with the fact that in fig .",
    "1 all galaxies lie above this estimate , for @xmath103 .",
    "as expected , we always have global inflows if @xmath96 , and the highest @xmath0 is reached when @xmath71 and @xmath64 , i.e. , again the most efficient way of increasing @xmath0 when the flow is not decoupled is to increase @xmath76 , and then @xmath77 . the spread in @xmath0 is of a factor of @xmath18 if @xmath82 , and very small for global inflows .",
    "the total spread is roughly of a factor of 30 , lower than for @xmath58 .      in order to investigate",
    "how common is the pw phase , we have run two more series of evolutionary sequences corresponding to a low @xmath104 , and to @xmath105 ; moreover , also the case @xmath106 has been explored .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "pws populate again most of the parameter space .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of @xmath104 models remains at low values even at high @xmath76 , in agreement with the observations ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; for many of these galaxies @xmath0 is likely to be dominated by the stellar emission .",
    "emission temperatures of the hot gas have been calculated recently by matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and buote & fabian ( 1997 ) , using @xmath11 data and two - temperature model fitting , for about 20 early - type galaxies .",
    "these temperatures cover the range @xmath107 kev , and the bulk of values lies within @xmath108 kev .",
    "the x - ray luminosity weighted emission temperatures of the models are given in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "they lie in the range @xmath109 kev , and so are in good agreement with those observed .",
    "they increase with central velocity dispersion , dark matter mass , and snia rate .",
    "note how a substantial snia s heating helps obtaining temperatures close to those observed ; other possible sources of heating not studied here are the presence of an external pressure due to an intracluster or intragroup medium ( e.g. , bertin & toniazzo 1995 ) , and that of a central black hole ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "the comparison with the observed x - ray surface brightness profiles @xmath110 is more delicate , because there is not a typical profile , nor a range of typical profiles . in the next ,",
    "first we examine what kind of @xmath110 are shown by pws ( which are the resulting flow regimes of the bulk of the galaxies , in our scenario ) , and then we discuss how @xmath110 of our models compare with the available observations .    in fig .",
    "5 we compare the _ shapes _ of the x - ray profiles of partial wind solutions with different stagnation radii with that of a global inflow with @xmath68 ( which closely resembles the cooling flow solution ) .",
    "when the stagnation radius is larger than the optical effective radius , the shape of @xmath111 is indistinguishable from that of the inflow , over most of the galaxy .",
    "pws with very small stagnation radii are instead less steep outside @xmath20 ; this is because in the external regions the gas density is actually lower for the pw than for the inflow , but the prevailing effect is given by the higher gas temperature of the pw , produced by the higher @xmath77 .",
    "so , judging from the shape of the @xmath110 profile , inflows and pws should be indistinguishable by x - ray observations , if @xmath74 is a few @xmath19 .",
    "of course , when @xmath74 is very small , @xmath0 is very low too , and so these pws are much less detectable by x - ray observations than global inflows",
    ".    now let s turn to the comparison with the observations .",
    "when @xmath112 of the gas flow is very low , and the x - ray emission is dominated by the contribution of the stellar sources , our models exhibit the x - ray profile of the underlying stellar population .",
    "no detailed @xmath110 for low @xmath7 galaxies is available yet from the observations . when @xmath112 of the flow is high",
    ", the observations  especially those produced by @xmath113  show a large variety of shapes for @xmath110 , often modified also by the interaction with the environment ( e.g. , trinchieri , fabbiano & kim 1997 ) . using _ einstein _",
    "data , trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares ( 1986 ) found that the observed @xmath111 tend to follow the optical ones , for few best studied x - ray bright galaxies . in our scenario such galaxies host pws with large stagnation radii , or inflows ; these flow phases have the same problems as cooling flows to reproduce x - ray profiles following the optical ones : they are too peaked ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "they can be brought in agreement with the observed @xmath110 by the introduction of distributed mass deposition due to thermal instabilities in the hot gas , as shown and discussed in detail by @xcite , and @xcite ; another possibility is stationary convective accretion onto a central massive black hole ( @xcite ) , or unstable accretion ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "a detailed comparison with @xmath110 observed for a specific galaxy requires a large number of simulations to find whether there is a combination of input parameters ( with the possible addition of the effect of the environment , and/or of a central black hole ) that gives a model reproducing the observations .",
    "this goes beyond the scope of this paper ; it has been done successfully for ngc4365 , in the framework of the cdpr scenario , by pellegrini & fabbiano ( 1994 ) .",
    "we summarize here the main properties of the flows , and the main differences with the results obtained by cdpr , produced by the new mass distributions and by the reduction of @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "the global wind phase disappears for all galaxies except the smallest ones ( see the case @xmath114 in table 2 ) : a central inflow , even though very small , is always present from the beginning of the evolution . as a consequence the outflow phase ",
    "the transition from a global wind to a global inflow in cdpr  also disappears .",
    "large @xmath0 variations are produced in the jh models by the different size of the central inflow region .",
    "most of the observed spread in @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 can be reproduced again , as it was in cdpr ( fig .",
    "1 ) : besides the observed variation from galaxy to galaxy in @xmath41 and in the concentration @xmath19 , a spread in the dark matter content , and/or a variation in the snia rate can produce large variations in @xmath74 and in the gas temperature , and then in @xmath0 ( of even a factor of @xmath97 , table 1 and fig .  1 ) .",
    "if @xmath76 remains at low values ( @xmath115 ) , though , it is difficult to reproduce @xmath0 higher than a few times @xmath116 ( table 2 ) , and so to cover all the observed @xmath0 variation .",
    "moreover , for a given range of variation of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , more luminous galaxies show less scatter in @xmath0 .",
    "another property of the flows in jh models is to accumulate cold gas at their centers , during the evolution ( @xmath117 in tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this mass when @xmath83 ranges from @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "evidence of cold gas at the center of bright x - ray galaxies has come recently from the high column densities ( @xmath120 ) required to obtain good fits of their x - ray spectra .",
    "the _ bbxrt _",
    "data require @xmath121 of cold gas in ngc1399 ( @xcite ) ; to fit the _ asca _ data of ngc4472 , @xmath122 of cold material are needed ( @xcite ) ; _ asca _ data require central column densities larger than the galactic value also for ngc4636 , ngc4406 , ngc720 , ngc1399 , ngc1404 , ngc4374 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested to explain this finding as the accumulation of cold material by a steady state cooling flow .",
    "this accumulation could have been produced by a pw as well ; moreover , even different amounts of cold material can be naturally explained in this scenario ( see the large variations of @xmath79 in table 1 ) .",
    "so , the finding of cold matter at the center of early - type galaxies can not be considered as evidence for a long lived cooling flow .",
    "note however that the accuracy of these @xmath120 absorption measurements could be affected by the uncertainties plaguing plasma spectra , and producing the iron - l problem (  1.3 ) .",
    "the origin of pws , and of the flows of a different nature obtained by cdpr , can be explained qualitatively in terms of the _ local _ @xmath123 function .",
    "the _ global _",
    "@xmath124 is defined as the ratio between the energy required to steadily extract the gas lost by the stars per unit time from the galactic potential well ( @xmath125 ) , and the heating supplied by the snia explosions plus the thermalization of the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "@xmath124 was introduced by cdpr to predict the expected flow phases in king galaxies , and was shown to work remarkably well by the numerical simulations : when @xmath127 the flow turned out to be an inflow , when @xmath128 a wind . in tables 1 and 2",
    "most of the resulting flow phases are not global , but pws , and so we are moved to investigate in more detail the distribution of the energetics inside the galaxy models .",
    "this distribution in fact can be much different for two galaxies with the same global @xmath124 .",
    "the local @xmath123 is defined as    @xmath129    where @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the total potential , @xmath134 is the one - dimensional isotropic velocity dispersion obtained by solving the jeans equations for the adopted mass model ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xmath135 is the specific mass return rate .",
    "the global @xmath124 is obtained by replacing the differentials in equation ( 2 ) with their integrals over the whole galaxy .",
    "the differences in the flow behavior of jh models and models with a central constant density region can be understood with the aid of fig .",
    "6 , where @xmath123 is shown for four representative one - component models .",
    "these have the same global @xmath124 , and so from an energetical point of view are globally equivalent .",
    "three of them are @xmath12-models , with @xmath136 , i.e. , they are the jaffe model , the hernquist model , and a model with a core",
    ". the fourth density distribution is described in the appendix , and is flatter at the center than the @xmath137 model , but for large @xmath138 it decreases @xmath139 , as all the @xmath12-models .",
    "this distribution is studied for its similarity with the king ( 1972 ) model , that needs the annoying introduction of a truncation radius , and has more complicated dynamical properties .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "6 that the steeper the density profile , the stronger is the variation of @xmath123 across the galaxy , and the higher are the values that it reaches at the center .",
    "this explains why a strong decoupling can be present in the flow of highly concentrated systems : a @xmath123 significantly higher than unity in the central regions produces a central inflow , while in the external parts a degassing is energetically possible because @xmath140 .",
    "_ this can happen when the global @xmath124 is either @xmath141 or @xmath142 _ ( see fig .  6 and table 1 ) , so this parameter is not a good indicator of the flow phase for highly concentrated systems . if @xmath124 decreases , the radius where @xmath143 moves inward for all the models , and so a larger part of the galaxy is degassing . note a fundamental difference in the trend of @xmath144 as a function of @xmath124 for models with a core and cuspier models : while in cuspy models there is always a region with @xmath145 , even though small , this is not the case for core models , in which such a region suddenly appears by increasing @xmath124 , with a size larger than the core .",
    "a second effect on @xmath123 is produced by the dark halo .",
    "if this halo is more diffuse than the stellar mass , increasing @xmath76 makes more bound the external regions , when @xmath124 is kept constant , and so the radius at which @xmath143 moves outward ( see fig .  7 for the case of jh models ) .",
    "the trend of @xmath146 for models with a core explains the results of the numerical simulations for king models plus diffuse quasi - isothermal dark halos obtained by cdpr and pellegrini & fabbiano ( 1994 ) .",
    "the flow phases found by cdpr with @xmath96 were all global ; with low @xmath76 , instead , the flow can be decoupled again , as found by pellegrini & fabbiano ( 1994 ) in their detailed modeling of the x - ray properties of two ellipticals .",
    "this because with high @xmath76 the region with @xmath147 constant is very large ( of the order of the core radius of the dark halo ) , while with low @xmath76 this region is of the order of the stellar core radius .    in summary ,",
    "the combined effect of snia s and dark matter is more varied for models with a core than for jh models : for a large range of @xmath76 values , the latter keep in pws with a varying @xmath74 , while the former can be in wind , pws , outflows or inflows .",
    "using evolutionary hydrodynamical simulations , we have investigated the properties of hot gas flows in elliptical galaxies described by a jaffe stellar density profile , and containing various amounts of dark matter , distributed as a hernquist law ; the rate of snia explosions is one - fourth of the tammann s rate , or lower .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the simulations show that most of the gas flows are strongly decoupled , i.e. , they develop an inflow in the central region of the galaxy , while the external parts are still degassing , albeit for reasons different from those causing the pws studied here ( dercole & ciotti 1997 ) . ] .",
    "the stagnation radius of these flows ( pws ) may range from a small fraction of the optical effective radius to many @xmath19 .",
    "this situation is present even when the global energy balance of the flow indicates that the energy inputs from snia s and from the thermalization of the stellar random motions is high enough to unbind all the gas ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "alternatively , the gas can be outflowing from the outer part of the galaxy even when the global energy balance indicates that the energy available is less than needed to unbind it all ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "so , @xmath124 is not a good indicator of the flow phase ; larger @xmath148 values , though , correspond to larger stagnation radii , for a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "global inflows are produced when the dark matter content is so high to bind the gas over the whole galaxy .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of pws is higher when @xmath77 is lower , because the inflow region is larger ; for global inflows @xmath0 is higher when @xmath77 is also higher , because the gas is hotter .",
    "the key factor causing large @xmath0 variations in jh models is the size of the central inflow region .",
    "the lowest @xmath7 values observed can be easily reproduced by pws ; high dark matter contents are required to approach the highest @xmath0 observed .",
    "the shape of the x - ray surface brightness profile of pws is close to that of global inflows , over most of the optical image , if the stagnation radius is a few @xmath19 ; it is externally less peaked than that , if @xmath74 is a fraction of @xmath19 , i.e. , when the gas is hotter than in the inflow case .",
    "the strong decoupling of the flow is explained by the radial trend of the local energy balance @xmath123 , that is very peaked for steep mass density profiles as in the jh models .",
    "previously used density profiles which were flat at the center  such as the king models plus quasi - isothermal dark halos  showed a larger tendency to have global flow phases , because also their @xmath146 is flatter .",
    "so , the change of the mass profile has an important effect : both numerical simulations and analytical calculations show how peaked density profiles preferentially develop decoupled gas flows ( in the sense that the region of the parameter space populated by pws is large compared to that of inflows or winds ) .    the results of our simulations compare with the observations in two main aspects .",
    "the first is that most of the observed spread in @xmath0 shown by the data is easily reproduced : the highest @xmath0 are again , as in cdpr , associated with global inflows , while the bulk of the galaxies are now in pw , rather than in outflow ; global winds are present only in the smallest galaxies .",
    "the second is that the presence of cold gas at the center of es , and a peaked x - ray surface brightness profile , can not be unequivocally associated to a cooling flow : a pw could be present as well , with a significant part of the galaxy degassing .",
    "particularly , a galaxy can have @xmath64 and still a non negligible amount of cold matter at the center .",
    "in addition , since @xmath74 varies over a wide range of radii , pws can accumulate largely varying quantities of cold gas .",
    "we wish to thank james binney , annibale dercole , paul goudfrooij and alvio renzini for stimulating discussions .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the contract asi-95-rs-152 .",
    "we derive here the main properties of the jh models that have been used in the numerical simulations and in the computations of @xmath124 and @xmath123 .",
    "the reported quantities are dimensionless , and the normalization constants are expressed in terms of the total stellar mass @xmath60 , the core radius @xmath39 and the gravitational constant @xmath149 ; again @xmath42 and @xmath150 .",
    "the cumulative mass inside @xmath151 and the total potential are given by : @xmath152 @xmath153 in the hydrodynamical simulations we used the globally isotropic stellar velocity dispersion profile , that we calculate here .",
    "for any two - component model the velocity dispersion profile is given by @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the 1-dimensional radial velocity dispersion .",
    "the first term is the isotropic velocity dispersion for the jaffe model : @xmath156 and the second one describes the contribution due to the hernquist dark halo : @xmath157 physically acceptable limits can be easily found for @xmath158 ( thus mimicking a black hole at the center of a jaffe model ) and for @xmath159 .    the cumulative potential and kinetic energies inside @xmath138 can be found analytically for this two - component model , but for simplicity we report here only their total values .",
    "the total potential energy is given by @xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 by integrating over the whole galaxy equation ( 3 ) , we have @xmath163 . the kinetic energy is again the sum of two different contributions , @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 the integration over the whole galaxy of equation ( 4 ) gives @xmath167 .",
    "here we derive the dynamical quantities corresponding to the density distribution @xmath168 the mass contained inside @xmath138 is given by @xmath169,\\ ] ] and the potential is @xmath170 the globally isotropic velocity dispersion is given by : @xmath171 as for the jh model , the potential and the kinetic energy inside the radius @xmath138 can be expressed analytically , but here we give only their total values , being the only ingredient required in the definition of @xmath124 : @xmath172 and @xmath173 finally , the projected distribution associated to @xmath174 is : @xmath175 from which one obtains @xmath176 .",
