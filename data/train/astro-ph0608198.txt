    "the lack of single - mode waveguides for the mid - infrared in the photonics field has pushed advanced technological studies to develop such devices @xcite . in this context , we have initiated , under esa contract , the _ ioda _ program ( _ i_ntegrated _ o_ptics for _ da_rwin ) to investigate the feasibility of a single - mode integrated optics concept operating over the full 5  20 @xmath0 m spectral range .",

    ", this paper presents the first study of the modal properties of selenide and telluride thick films at longer wavelengths .",

    "thus , the quantity @xmath14 increases with the operating wavelength and also depends on the dispersion of the material .",
    "here , we briefly evaluate from a simple theoretical approach the possibility to benefit of a single - mode planar waveguide over the full darwin range ( 5  20 @xmath0 m ) using as@xmath15se@xmath16 glass as the layer and as@xmath15s@xmath16 glass as the substrate .",

    "the adopted models are justified by the fact that the refractive indices of these materials decrease almost linearly in the 5  20 @xmath0 m range . under those assumptions",
    ", we compute the cut - off thicknesses @xmath7 and @xmath21 for modes @xmath11=0 and @xmath11=1 and for 5 @xmath0m@xmath22@xmath19@xmath2220 @xmath0 m .",
    "the acceptable slab thickness @xmath6 for single - mode behavior over our spectral band must comply with @xmath7(20@xmath0m)@xmath22@xmath6@xmath22@xmath21(5@xmath0 m ) .",
    "however , since we found @xmath7(20@xmath0m)=2.903 @xmath0 m and @xmath21(5@xmath0m)=2.577 @xmath0 m , the previous condition can not be fulfilled .",

    "+ we underline that this modal analysis is based only on the study of the opto - geometrical parameters of the waveguide and is thus sensitive to the numerical fit . to better constrain the trade - off between fundamental mode confinement and higher - mode filtering properties ( which requires to be far from the cut - off ) , a more detailed electromagnetic approach through beam propagation method ( bpm )",
    "simulations will be required .",
    "however , our results show that a good compromise could reasonably be reached by splitting the 5  20 @xmath0 m band into no more than two sub - bands , with two dedicated waveguide designs , and on the condition that a sufficient index difference between the film and the substrate is ensured .",

    "the deposition process used is thermal evaporation , which reduces the column - like effects in the structure and provides dense films with higher refractive index with respect to rf - sputtering techniques.the selenide films were deposited from as@xmath31se@xmath32 commercial bulk glass , while the telluride films used bulk glass that was synthesized in the laboratory from commercial components like tellurium ( te ) , arsenic ( as ) and selenide ( se ) .",

    "( [ dm ] ) shows that , for a given @xmath37 , @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath19 .",

    "consequently , we have experimentally investigated the modal behavior of the sample , the refractive index and the thickness of the films through the mid - infrared _ m_-lines experiment developed at laog ( laboratoire dastrophysique de grenoble ) .",
    "the _ m_-lines method , based on prism coupling theory , was first proposed by tien _",

    "this provides a thin air gap that should optimally be a quarter of the operating wavelength to maximize the coupling effect .",
    "when a ray reaches the base of the prism with an incident angle smaller than the critical angle defined by the prism index , it becomes totally reflected .",
    "however , the overlap of the evanescent fields in the air gap as predicted by electromagnetic theory @xcite implies that light can be coupled into the waveguide similarly to a tunneling effect .",
    "the existing modes of the waveguide will be excited if the phase matching conditions given by eq .",
    "( [ phase - match ] ) are fulfilled    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath2 are respectively the prism and the thick film indices , and @xmath41 and @xmath30 are the angular directions of the rays as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ principle ] . exciting the low - order modes of the structure",
    "requires a prism with higher index than the slab waveguide index . under these conditions , and for the incident rays that fulfill the phase conditions , the coupling phenomenon will lead to the observation of `` black lines '' at discrete positions @xmath29 in the reflected beam pattern .",

    "the computation of the thick film index @xmath2 and its thickness @xmath6 is obtained by implementing a non - linear least squares method ( see subsection  [ data_process ] ) .",

    "[ setup ] .",
    "the infrared source is a co@xmath46 laser . to probe either te or tm modes , the quarter - wave plate @xmath47 modifies the intrinsic linear polarization of the source into an elliptical one , then the grid polarizer @xmath48 selects the desired polarization .",

    ", the _ m_-lines experiment was run at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath19=1.196 @xmath0 m ) and for which we used a silicon prism with an angle @xmath27=44.8416@xmath50@xmath515@xmath1810@xmath53 and a refractive index @xmath52=3.5193@xmath5110@xmath53 . in our system , the position of the black line is measured with an accuracy of @xmath510.01@xmath50 .          in this paper , we have assumed that the tested samples are asymmetric slab waveguides ( i.e. air / as@xmath54se@xmath55/as@xmath54s@xmath55 ) with a step index distribution . to obtain a correct numbering of the modes , we used the property of linearity between the squared spectrum of mode indices @xmath56 and the mode numbers set ( @xmath11 + 1)@xmath57 , as formalized by lee _ et al._@xcite .",
    "thus , when more than three experimental mode indices are available , their numbering is derived from the computation of the linear regression coefficient @xmath58 of the experimental curve [ @xmath56,(m+1)@xmath57 ] and compared to unity ( see tables  [ as-1ir],[as-1ir-10um ] ) . in this paper , we assume that mode numbering starts with @xmath11=0 .",
    "successively , we compute @xmath2 and @xmath6 by numerically solving @xcite the waveguide dispersion equation for a step index distribution planar waveguide given by eq .",

    "( [ disp ] ) .",
    "the correct mode numbering is then obtained through a best fit between the theoretical and experimental distributions of indices .",
