    "adiabatic loading appears to preserve the condensate fraction of the ideal gas quite well , while rotation enhances the height of the gaussian relative to the rotating frame harmonic trap , thus deepening the toroidal potential .",
    "another promising method is to evaporatively cool directly into the toroidal trap .",
    "the existence of a scale invariant regime shows that rather than always decreasing with toroidal radius , @xmath1 for such a system reaches a well defined plateau . a system with these properties may be promising for creating and loading a large toroidal trap with a persistent current while maintaining quantum degeneracy .",

    "<S> this property is a consequence of an invariant extensive volume of the system that we identify analytically in the regime where the toroidal potential is radially harmonic . in considering corrections to the scale invariant transition temperature , we find that the first order interaction shift is the dominant effect in the thermodynamic limit , and is also scale invariant . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider adiabatic loading from the harmonic to toroidal trap configuration , which we show to have only a small effect on the condensate fraction of the ideal gas , indicating that loading into the scale invariant regime may be experimentally practical . </S>"
