    "among the various modes of star formation , triggered star formation attracts a special interest due to an increasing availability of multi - wavelength observations of expanding shells in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the idea of self - stimulating star formation is quite old @xcite .",
    "however , there are still only a few examples of star - forming regions , where triggering can be inferred more or less reliably @xcite .",
    "the reason is that expanding shells often have irregular shapes , so it is hard to deduce an evolutionary sequence based on morphology alone .    in our previous paper (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) we presented arguments in favour of triggered star formation around an extended h  region , sh2 - 235 ( hereafter s235 ) , using both morphological and kinematical data .",
    "s235 is located in the perseus spiral arm toward the anticentre of the galaxy at @xmath28 and @xmath3 .",
    "the region surrounding s235 is a site of active star formation .",
    "young star clusters in its vicinity were recently investigated , e.g. by  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in paper",
    "i we argued that the formation of three clusters , located close to the edge of s235 , could have been triggered by an expansion of the h  region via a `` collect - and - collapse '' ( c&c ) process due to gravitational instability in a dense material accumulated between the ionisation front and the shock wave . in the present paper",
    "we refer to these clusters as s235east1 , s235east2 , and s235central , following the notation introduced in paper  i. their cross - identification can be found in  @xcite .    the inhomogeneously distributed molecular gas around the s235 h  region @xcite complicates an analysis of the triggering scenario . in paper  i arguments in favour of triggering",
    "were found on the basis of 1 )  relative positions of the three embedded star clusters , dense molecular clumps , and the h  region itself , and 2 )  kinematics of molecular gas emitting @xmath4co(10 )  and cs(21 )  lines .",
    "it was shown that the young star clusters s235east1 , s235east2 , and s235central  are embedded in dense molecular gas which forms a shell - like structure at the south - eastern side of s235 .",
    "each cluster is embedded in a separate dense clump , which is clearly visible on a cs(21 )  map . the morphology and location of the sources and the distribution of the molecular gas",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : general_view ] .",
    "note that s235 is not completely surrounded by the dense shell .",
    "there is some gas emitting in @xmath5co(10 ) and @xmath4co(10 ) lines to the north and west from s235  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath4co(10 )  brightness significantly decreases in these directions , so we had not observed that area during observing sessions described in paper  i. also , the column density of molecular gas located in front of the h  region decreases to the south of s235 as this gas becomes transparent to the optical emission . in paper",
    "i we proposed that expansion of s235 triggered the formation of a dense shell and subsequent formation of three young embedded stellar clusters .",
    "three kinematic components were distinguished in paper  i that may represent basic stages of interaction of young stellar objects with the surrounding medium . the first component that we refer to as primordial arguably comprises quiescent clumpy gas of the parent giant molecular cloud g174 + 2.5 that has not yet been disturbed by the expansion of s235 .",
    "the second kinematic component represents gas that was entrained in motion and compressed by the expansion of the h  region .",
    "this is the gas out of which the young star clusters have been formed .",
    "this gas still partially surrounds them .",
    "the third kinematic component supposedly corresponds to gas blown away by stellar winds from s235east2  and s235central  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : general_view ] , right panel ) .",
    "it was proposed in paper  i that these two clusters are , probably , more evolved than s235east1 .",
    "the star forming region s235a - b encompasses both s235a and s235b nebulae and is located almost 10  to the south of s235central .",
    "the s235a nebula is an expanding h  region  @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that s235b is a reflection nebula .",
    "a water maser was found toward the region between s235a  and s235b  @xcite suggesting that massive star formation takes place there .",
    "stellar mass estimates by @xcite indicate that this water maser is associated with a young stellar object of high mass .",
    "the s235a - b region is not located in the compressed shell around the s235 h  region . in paper",
    "i we suggested that star formation in s235a - b is not related to the expansion of s235 .",
    "this paper presents new observational data related to the star forming regions s235east1 , s235east2 , s235central  in the immediate vicinity of s235 , and to regions around the s235a  and s235b  nebulae .",
    "the aim of this work is to determine physical conditions in these star forming regions .",
    "ammonia emission was observed to estimate gas temperature and number density as this molecule is known to be both a thermometer and a densitometer for dense molecular gas  @xcite .",
    "the derived physical structure turns out to be consistent with our star formation scenario in this region and the inferred evolutionary stages of the young embedded star clusters .",
    "ammonia emission was mapped toward the s235east1 , s235east2 , and s235central  star clusters as well as toward s235a - b and primordial molecular gas at other locations .",
    "we first searched for ( @xmath6 and ( 2,2 ) emission ( @xmath7 = 23.694496 and 23.722631ghz ) toward three selected positions with the pushchino 22-m telescope ( rt-22 , astro space centre of lebedev physical institute , pushchino , russian academy of sciences ) in april 2006 .",
    "rest frequencies of observed ammonia transitions were taken from the catalogue of  @xcite .",
    "we used an on - on observing technique based on beam switching  @xcite with a beam throw of 10  at 23ghz .",
    "the main beam efficiency was 0.38 and the calibration uncertainty is estimated to be 10@xmath815@xmath8 .",
    "we used the 50  mhz band of the pushchino autocorrelator with 2048 channels .",
    "the spectral resolution was about 24  khz .",
    "the full width at half power ( fwhp ) beam size of the 22-m telescope is about 2.6  which is larger than the size of the individual sources .",

    "emission from the ( @xmath10 , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , and ( 4,4 ) ammonia transitions was mapped with the 100-m effelsberg telescope in april and october 2007 .",
    "we observed areas in star forming regions around s235 that are bright in the cs(21 )  emission and host young embedded star clusters .",

    "thus we were able to obtain data on all four ammonia lines in two orthogonal linear polarizations simultaneously .",

    "observations were done in a position switching mode .",
