    "the most successful observational method for planet searches has been the method of radial velocity surveys . among over 1000 target stars , jupiter- mass planets , with period up to a few years , have been found around more than 10 % of them ( cumming _ et al .",
    "this fraction is likely to increase with follow - up high - precision measurements of trends in the radial velocity curves which reveal suggestive signals for many additional planetary companions .",
    "this prolific success in the discovery of planets around these field stars is in sharp contrast to the rarity of planets around stars in both open and globular clusters . despite several attempts to search for planets in the hyades ( guenther _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) , only one planet is found around one star ( sato _ et al .",
    "it is tempting to attribute this dichotomy to an environmental influence on the proficiency of planet formation .",
    "for example , bonnell et al . ( 2001 ) suggested that , if the cluster went through an initial high density phase , close stellar encounters during the planetary formation epoch may have tidally truncated the disk and eliminated the domain of giant planet formation .",
    "this argument , however , is weakened by the poorly known time scale and location of giant planet formation .",
    "it also does not take into account the possibility of subsequent stellar accretion of the tidally stripped gas which may provide a protracted environment for planet formation .",
    "the discovery of planets in several binary systems with separation of a few au s ( queloz _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , hatzes _",
    "_ 2003 , zucker _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 , correia _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) is another sign that perturbations which are induced by neighboring stars alone can not be an efficient mechanism to quench planet formation .",
    "the current paradigm for star formation theory is based on the realization that field stars are generally formed in dense gaseous environments which are similar to , but slightly less massive and concentrated than the progenitor of the longer - lived open clusters . in many dense star - forming molecular clouds",
    ", the fraction of stars with protostellar disks depends more sensitively on the stellar age rather than the dynamical properties of their host clusters ( hillenbrand 2005 ) . even in dense regions which contain massive stars , such as the orion nebula ,",
    "the silhouettes of protostellar disks are commonly found ( odell _ et al .",
    "traces of radioactive decay products in the most primitive chondritic meteorites provide strong evidence that the formation of the solar system was preceeded by a nearby supernova event ( cameron & truran 1977 ) .",
    "since the massive progenitors of supernovae are only found in relatively dense molecular clouds , it is likely that the solar system actually formed in a stellar aggregate with @xmath2 members ( adams & laughlin 2001 ) .",
    "these circumstantial pieces of evidence support the conjecture that planets may not form less prolifically in open clusters than the progenitors of the present - day field stars .",
    "an alternative scenario for the rarity of planet detection in open clusters may be attributed to post - formation dynamics .",
    "there is supporting circumstantial evidence for dynamical disruption of planetary systems during the infancy of their host stars in dense molecular clouds .",
    "a population of `` freely floating '' planets , with 5 - 15 jupiter masses , has been found in the young cluster @xmath1 orionis ( zapatero - osorio et al .",
    "2000 , lucas et al .",
    "if these free floaters indeed formed near some host stars , a reliable census of their frequency in a wide range of star forming regions would provide a calibration on the critical conditions for planetary system disruption .",
    "however , this task is particularly challenging because their detection and distinction from bound planets by microlensing observations are generally difficult ( c.f .",
    "han 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast to open clusters , stellar associations which provided the birth place for the known planet - bearing field stars probably dispersed under the combined action of internal dynamical relaxation , stellar evolution , and the tidal perturbation of their host galaxies over a time scale @xmath3 yr . during this epoch ,",
    "the planetary - retention probability of individual stars is determined by a competition between cluster disruption and planetary - system break up .",
    "the planetary - system dichotomy would be explained if stellar interactions and encounters affect the stability and dynamical evolution of their companion planetary systems on a time scale longer than the associations dispersal time scale but shorter than the age of typical open clusters .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "smith & bonnell ( 2001 ) inferred that only a small fraction of planets would become detached from their host stars during the characteristic life span of young clusters and association .",
    "their results are obtained using the equations of restricted three body motion to approximate encounters between planetary systems with nearly circular orbits and single stars .",
    "they claimed that the few detached planets would escape from open and young clusters because the planets recoil speed is generally large compared with the clusters velocity dispersion .",
    "these conclusions are modified if the perturbers are binary stars .",
    "this problem has been systematically addressed with a monte carlo approach by laughlin & adams ( 1998 ) in which they focused their attention on the effect of four body scattering ( a binary star , and a planet ) .",
    "they averaged the stellar density over the cluster to obtain effective cross sections for the disruption of a jupiter - like planetary orbit by all the binary stars .",
    "also davies & sigurdsson ( 2001 ) included in their monte carlo study encounters with binaries .    in these early studies ,",
    "a restricted range of planetary orbits was under consideration .",
    "for example , laughlin and adams focused their attention on planets which were initially on a 5 au circular orbit around the host star .",
    "however , the known extra solar planets have a semi - major axis ranging from 0.05 au to several au . those with periods longer than a week have a nearly uniform eccentricity distribution up to unity ( cf .",
    "_ , in prep . )",
    "although planets are probably formed in their nascent disks beyond the snow line with nearly circular orbits ( ida & lin 2004 ) , their eccentricity may be excited shortly after their formation through their interaction with their nascent disks ( goldreich & sari 2003 , creswell _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) or with each other ( rasio & ford 1996 , lin & ida 1997 ) . dynamical instability and relaxation is particularly effective in exciting the planets eccentricity especially in closely - packed multiple - planet systems ( papaloizou & terquem 2002 , zhou _ et al _ 2007 , juric & tremaine 2007 , ford & rasio 2007 ) .    for most non - disruptive encounters ,",
    "the stellar perturbation nonetheless modifies the eccentricities of the planets .",
    "individual planets with modestly eccentric orbits may be more vulnerable to disruption by subsequent stellar perturbations",
    ". repeated stellar interactions may be particularly damaging to the survival of planetary systems .",
    "observational data also indicate that a significant fraction of known planets , if not most of them , have additional planetary siblings around their host stars ( fischer et al .",
    "although the present - day separation in these known systems is generally wide and they are intrinsically stable , stellar perturbation in the past can provide an additional avenue for inducing their dynamical relaxation .",
    "the cumulative excitation of eccentricity , which results from both close and distant single and binary star encounters , may also lead to dynamical instabilities in closely packed multiple planetary systems , resulting in dissolution of a planetary system or in the merger of some planets with their host star .",
    "the destabilization of these multiple - planet systems generally occurs through secular and nonlinear interactions over many orbital periods ( zhou _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) .    taking these physical processes into account",
    ", there is a need to investigate the effect of stellar encounters on planetary systems with more general initial condition than previously considered .",
    "preliminary studies ( see e.g. the different results obtained from direct @xmath0-body simulations of hurley & shara 2002 ) indicate that the planetary retention efficiency may be strongly modified if the planets attain a modest eccentricity shortly after their birth .",
    "ideally , the dynamical interaction between multiple planets and cluster stars needs to be investigated . in reality , the vast range of possible orbital configuration and mass distribution make any attempts to represent potential planetary systems futile .",
    "the orbital periods of compact planetary systems are much shorter than the crossing time of the cluster . on the time scale of a large number of orbital periods ,",
    "multiple planets interact with each other through cumulative low - amplitude secular perturbations .",
    "the accuracy requirement for calculating the long - term behaviour of multiple - planet systems is much higher than that needed for the reliable simulation of star clusters . for long - term solar system dynamics , symplectic methods , using a generalized leap - frog , like the widely used wisdom - holman symplectic mapping method ( wisdom & holman 1991 , see also review by duncan & quinn 1993 ) , are the best suited integration methods .",
    "they do not show secular errors in energy and angular momentum . in principle , the symplectic mapping methods can be used to treat the planets , while the dynamics and perturbation induced by their host stars is computed with an @xmath0-body scheme . however , in their standard implementation , the symplectic mapping methods require a constant time step , which is not compatible with the central motivation of the ahmad - cohen neighbour scheme .",
    "another more practical approach to strongly reducing the planets secular errors in a @xmath0-body scheme is to enforce a time - symmetric scheme by making the time steps reversible through an iteration ( hut , makino , & mcmillan 1995 , funato et al .",
    "1996 , kokubo , yoshinaga & makino 1998 ) .",
    "such schemes have not yet been used for long - term secular evolution of planetary systems .",
    "because of these complications , it would be immensely challenging to consider the effects of secular interactions between closely - spaced multiple planets concurrently with the dynamical evolution of the cluster . as an alternative",
    ", we may aim to disentangle the different physical effects , and we begin here by focusing solely on the influence of gravitational encounters on an otherwise unperturbed planetary orbit .",
    "having derived cross sections and time scales for these processes as functions of relevant parameters of the planetary system and its environment , we will be in a much better position to assess the conditions under which internal and external perturbations of planetary systems will couple , and those in which they will act on very different time scales .",
    "this analysis can also be applied to address the issue of a lack of planets in globular clusters . in a recent search for transit events among stars in the core region of an old , metal - poor globular cluster , 47 tuc ,",
    "no short - period planets have been found ( weldrake 2007 and references therein ) , even though 17 such objects were expected to be discovered ( gilliland et al .",
    "one possible cause for the absence of planets in globular clusters such as 47 tuc may be the suppression of their formation due to lack of heavy elements in their progenitor clouds ( ida & lin 2005a ) .",
    "however , we note that the mean metallicity deficiency ( compared with the solar value ) of 47 tuc is smaller than the spread in the dust mass among disks around t tauri stars ( beckwith 1998 ) .",
    "the detection of another planet around a pulsar in globular cluster m4 confirms that although their formation may be suppressed it is not prohibited around metal - deficient stars .",
    "however , its stellar allegiance may have been altered through an exchange/ capture event during a close encounter between its original parent and its present host star ( sigurdsson et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "short - period ( a few days ) planets reside deeply in the potential of their host stars and can only be perturbed by a very close encounter between stars . using an order of magnitude estimate for the encounter time scale between a single star and a planetary system , bonnell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argued that , in globular clusters , planets with semi major axis greater than 0.3 au may be detached from their host stars .",
    "this estimate is based on an extrapolation from the outcomes of encounters between systems of three bodies of comparable mass , which may not be appropriate for the limiting case in which one of these bodies ( the planet ) is much less massive than the others @xcite .    in dense globular clusters , occasional close stellar encounters can induce eccentricity excitation even for planets with relatively short periods ( davies & sigurdsson 2001 ) . in multiple - planet systems ,",
    "eccentricity excitation of long - period planets can also affect close - in planets through the secular interaction between them ( cf mardling & lin 2002 , nagasawa & lin 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , tidal dissipation inside both short - period planets and their host stars can damp their eccentricity as indicated by the negligible eccentricity observed among all planets with period @xmath4 days ( cf dobbs - dixon _ et al .",
    "the combined influence of these effects heats the planetary interior and may cause the planet to inflate ( bodenheimer _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . very close to their host stars ,",
    "tidal inflation may be sufficiently strong to disrupt planets ( gu _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) . as the stellar relaxation process leads to an increase in the density of background stars , their perturbation on their planetary companions intensifies",
    ". this process may be particularly effective in eliminating planetary companions of relatively low - mass stars in a globular cluster environment such as 47 tuc .    in order to 1 ) verify this induced disruption scenario for the differences between planetary systems around stars inside and outside stellar clusters , 2 ) quantitatively determine the critical condition for planetary retention , and 3 ) assess the impact of stellar perturbations on close - in planets , we consider , in this paper , the dynamical evolution of planet - bearing stars in a range of cluster environments .",
    "in contrast to previous investigations , we focus on the diverse dynamical structure of planetary systems rather than the distribution of stellar kinematics , mass , and multiplicity . for simplicity of analysis , we only consider interactions between single stars and planetary systems",
    ". in realistic clusters where their fraction is large , binary stars may indeed provide more effective perturbers than single stars for the break - up of planetary systems , especially during the early epoch of cluster evolution when the stellar density is relatively high .",
    "nevertheless , interactions between single stars are also important for the long - term survival of planetary systems in star clusters .    in order to resolve some of these outstanding issues in both open and globular cluster environments ,",
    "we carry out a series of numerical simulations which are designed to investigate the influence of stellar encounters on the dynamics of extrasolar planets with a wide variety of orbital properties .",
    "in contrast to previous studies we use a special @xmath0-body code ( nbody6++ : spurzem 1999 ) , which is based on the nbody6 code by aarseth ( 1999a , b , 2003 ) and can be used on massively parallel computers .",
    "in addition we use the hybrid monte carlo model ( hmc ) of giersz & spurzem ( 2003 ) as an approximate model of star clusters with large particle numbers and many planetary systems .",
    "these simulations , though more time consuming than plain statistical approaches in which only encounters are modeled , have the advantage that they can take into account both the spatial and time variation of the stellar background in young , open , and globular clusters .",
    "in a previous series of experiments , davies & sigurdsson ( 2001 ) have studied a monte carlo model of planetary systems interacting with stars and binaries in a dense star cluster such as 47 tuc .",
    "however they did not include the dynamical evolution of the cluster and just studied isolated three and four  body encounters .",
    "( also their coverage of parameters was smaller than ours . )",
    "both the nbody6++ and hmc code are well suited to follow a wide range of encounters and to overcome some of these shortcomings .",
    "the nbody6++ scheme is also ideally suited to the inclusion of the dominant dynamical influence of binary stars and occasional hierarchical triple systems , but in this paper we only focus on interactions of single stars with planetary systems .",
    "another advantage is the possibility of simulating the consequence of several successive stellar encounters .",
    "after the planetary eccentricities are slightly excited by the first encounters , their rate of increase may be accelerated during the subsequent encounters .    in this paper",
    ", we first focus on a comparison between empirical cross sections for orbital changes and analytical estimates ( using several approximations ) .",
    "this study is intended to clarify the extent to which the existing analytical cross sections can be used , and we also are interested to see from the numerical models where they can not be used any more , e.g. for the case of liberation of planets , either by successions of weak encounters or single strong ones .",
    "our main interest is to understand the physical mechanisms , and an improvement for more realistic environments ( binaries , multi - planetary systems and their internal interactions ) is the subject of future work .",
    "section  2 summarizes some of the existing knowledge on analytical cross sections for changes of eccentricity and semi - major axis of a planetary system due to encounters . in section  3",
    "we describe the setup of the numerical simulations and section  4 contains a description and analysis of the results .",
    "we pay special attention to the changes of planetary orbits in a statistical way by searching for encounter events which affect their eccentricities and semi - major axes ( see for comparison also theuns 1996 ) .",
    "once identified , data on these events are accumulated , and the results are then binned and presented as empirical differential cross sections for the outcomes of encounters between single stars and planetary systems ; here we use methods developed for the monte - carlo models and those of giersz & spurzem ( 2003 ) . finally , we summarize the findings of these numerical experiments and discuss their astrophysical implications in section  5 .",
    "we aim to study the statistics of encounters between a passing star ( the third body ) and a simple planetary system consisting of a single planet and its star .",
    "we focus on the change in eccentricity @xmath5 and the relative change in binding energy @xmath6 .",
    "these depend on all the initial parameters of the encounter , but the essential parameters are the distance of closest approach , @xmath7 , and the speed of the third body at infinity , @xmath8 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : scatter - hard ] and [ fig : scatter - soft ] ) . if @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the semi - major axis of the planet , then the encounter is _",
    "tidal_. if @xmath8 is much larger than the orbital speed of the planet then the encounter is _ impulsive _ , unless @xmath7 is so large that the time scale of the encounter becomes comparable with the period of the planet . at still larger @xmath7",
    "the encounter is _",
    "adiabatic _ , which means here that the angular speed of the planet is much larger than that of the passing star .",
    "if @xmath8 is small compared to the orbital speed of the planet , then a tidal encounter is always adiabatic .",
    "when @xmath7 is very large the path of the passing star is _ hyperbolic _ with high eccentricity , but at smaller values ( though still in the tidal regime @xmath9 ) it is nearly _",
    "parabolic_. these distinctions are essential in the analytical interpretation of numerical data .",
    "appendix a collects a number of formulae for @xmath11 and @xmath12 which are approximately valid deep within some of these regimes . in adiabatic regimes an important role is played by parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which serve to quantify these ideas .",
    "the first parameter is just the eccentricity of the relative orbit of the passing star .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath7 denotes the distance of pericentre for the passing star , the mass of the binary is @xmath16 , the mass of the third star is @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in our simulations ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 , and so we have @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath14 measures the ratio of the time scales involved , and a necessary condition for an adiabatic encounter in the sense explained above is @xmath22 .",
    "however , this criterion by itself would be sufficient only if the encounter with the third star were parabolic . if the encounter is hyperbolic the condition for an adiabatic encounter is given by @xmath23 ( heggie & rasio 1996 ) , in which the hyperbolic eccentricity @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath8 denote the impact parameter and relative velocity at infinity . with these parameters we get for the minimum distance @xmath7 of the third star relative to the centre of mass of the planetary system @xmath26 the impact parameter @xmath25 and distance of closest approach @xmath7",
    "are related by @xmath27    now we consider the orbital response of a planet as a consequence of stellar encounters .",
    "due to perturbations by passing stars , the semi - major axis and eccentricity of a planet experiences successive changes @xmath28 and @xmath12 which correspond to changes in its binding energy and angular momentum per unit mass , according to the equations @xmath29 @xmath30 the orbital energy per unit mass @xmath31 is inversely proportional to the semi - major axis , and for a circular orbit it is just minus half the squared velocity .",
    "accompanying the changes in @xmath32 and @xmath10 are changes in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , but we pay no attention to these in this paper .",
    "the formulae in appendix a give approximate expressions for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for a single encounter , and depend on all the initial conditions . for statistical purposes",
    "it is more useful to consider instead _ cross sections _ , @xmath1 .",
    "for example @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , would be defined as the cross section for encounters in which the relative change of binding energy exceeds @xmath11 .",
    "this would be a function of @xmath38 , the masses and ( possibly ) @xmath32 , though usually we will consider cross sections averaged over the distribution of @xmath32 .",
    "often also we consider _ differential cross sections _ such as @xmath39 .",
    "cross sections essentially involve the impact parameter @xmath25 , while the size of the changes @xmath11 and @xmath12 is more directly related to the distance of closest approach , @xmath7 .",
    "there are two limiting cases : ( i ) strongly hyperbolic encounters without significant gravitational focusing , where @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and hence @xmath43 ; and ( ii ) the case in which @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and so @xmath46 .",
    "in this second case we have strong gravitational focusing and the second term in equation  ( [ eq : prp ] ) above dominates , so that @xmath47 . when @xmath48 the encounter is parabolic and @xmath49 .",
    "a given planetary system may experience encounters of either type , but which type dominates depends essentially on @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have performed simulations for two ranges of semi - major axes of planetary orbits , which we denote for reference as `` hard '' ( 0.03 to 5 au ) and `` soft '' ( 3 - 50 au ) , cf . table 1 . as is shown in figs . 1 and 2 our `` soft '' planets",
    "nearly exclusively experience encounters where the velocity @xmath8 of the encountering star at infinity is larger than the orbital velocity of the planet @xmath50 . in the case of `` hard '' planets ( in our sense )",
    "we find a large amount of encounters ( but not all ) with the opposite case @xmath51 .",
    "note that our use of the term `` hard '' and `` soft '' for planetary systems differs from the definition of @xcite .",
    "they use the velocity @xmath52 as a threshold , such that for @xmath53 the binding energy of the planetary system is comparable to the kinetic energy of the incoming star .",
    "such definition is equivalent to what is used for binaries in star clusters ( heggie 1975 ) , where hard binaries have a clear tendency to become harder in close encounters .",
    "however , in our models , the planetary mass is very small compared to the stellar mass ( @xmath20 ) , so we have @xmath54 .",
    "an inspection of our figs .",
    "1 and 2 shows that there are practically no encounters with @xmath55 .",
    "therefore we choose our definition of `` hard '' and `` soft '' planets , which we will use henceforth without quotation marks , just motivated to distinguish two different initial sets of semi - major axes of planetary systems .",
    "indeed , in our models there are effectively only two regimes . for our",
    "_ soft _ planets , @xmath8 typically exceeds the orbital speed of the planet @xmath56 .",
    "these encounters are impulsive if @xmath7 is not too large .",
    "they become adiabatic and hyperbolic if @xmath7 is large enough . on the other hand , many ( but not all ) encounters of our _ hard _ planets fall into the category @xmath57 . here",
    "tidal encounters at small enough @xmath7 are parabolic , but hyperbolic encounters occur at large enough @xmath7 .        in the case of soft planets ,",
    "the most important tidal encounters may be treated as impulsive .",
    "first we provide an estimate for the form of the cross section , and then state an accurate result .",
    "let @xmath58 be the time scale for the encounter , i.e. @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the velocity of the passing star at pericentre .",
    "our assumption here is that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the orbital time of the planetary system , i.e. we are far from the fully adiabatic limit .",
    "then we approximate the change of velocity of the orbiting planet due to the perturbation by the passing star as @xmath63 where @xmath28 is the difference between the acceleration of the planet ( by the perturber ) and that of the parent star ( by the perturber ) , which we estimate by a tidal approximation .    now",
    "the _ relative _ changes in the binding energy , @xmath64 , and angular momentum , @xmath65 , of the planetary system may be estimated by @xmath66 , and so by equation  ( [ eq : dj ] ) this may also be used to estimate @xmath67 , which we define as the change in the _ square _ of the eccentricity , @xmath68 .",
    "( this is more convenient than @xmath12 itself in some later analysis . )",
    "so we have @xmath69 for the last step above we have used @xmath70 .",
    "we also use @xmath71 .",
    "thus @xmath72 the total cross section is @xmath73 , and so we get for the differential cross @xmath74    for a proper estimate we may adopt the approach which was taken by heggie ( 1975 ) for the computation of the cross section for the relative energy change . as shown in appendix",
    "[ sec : imp_tid ] , the result is that @xmath75 where we have specialized to the case in which the two stars ( the passing star and the sun in the planetary system ) have the same mass @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is a constant which is defined in terms of a certain average , and evaluates numerically to @xmath78 approximately .",
    "now we consider adiabatic tidal encounters .",
    "using a first - order expansion , heggie ( 1975 ) and heggie & rasio ( 1996 ) obtained the net secular ( i.e. long - term relative to the binary s orbital period ) changes of eccentricity @xmath12 for parabolic and hyperbolic encounters between a single field star and a close binary star .",
    "we adapt their formula to our case , in which the masses @xmath79 of the planet s host star and @xmath17 of the approaching star are large compared to the planetary mass @xmath80 ; so we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "equation ( 7 ) of heggie & rasio ( 1996 ) yields for this case @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the function in curly brackets in eq.([eq : de - noncirc ] ) in the present paper .",
    "it reduces to @xmath85 for parabolic encounters , so to order of magnitude we use @xmath86 in this case . for highly hyperbolic encounters we have similarly @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and we use @xmath89 .",
    "it follows that @xmath90 from equations  ( [ eq : de ] ) we can deduce approximate total cross sections for both limits , using @xmath91 for the hyperbolic case , and @xmath92 for the parabolic case .",
    "it follows that @xmath93 and so we recover in the parabolic case the form of the result in heggie & rasio ( 1996 ) ( see below ) . from this , differential cross sections are computed by @xmath94    the details are given in appendix b , where the following accurate results are obtained .",
    "( note , however , that these are differential cross sections for the change in @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 . ) in the case of extremely hyperbolic encounters with hard planets , the calculation is carried out in appendix  [ sec : d_hyperbolic ] , and yields a formula of the same form as for impulsive encounters : @xmath97 where @xmath98 approximately . for parabolic encounters , however ,",
    "the corresponding result was essentially given by equation ( 19 ) of @xcite .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ sec : d_parabolic ] this leads to the differential cross section @xmath99 ^ 2\\frac{gma}{v^2}(d)^{-5/3}.\\ ] ] the form of this cross section is different , because of gravitational focusing .",
    "we consider now the relative change in energy , @xmath11 , and begin with impulsive tidal encounters .",
    "as already mentioned , formulae were given by section  4.2 of @xcite for the change in energy in an impulsive tidal encounter , and all that is needed is to specialize to the case @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and to harmonize the notation .",
    "he gives ( his equation  ( 4.24 ) ) a cross section for the change @xmath102 in binding energy @xmath103 . in the language of the present paper",
    "his cross section is our differential cross section @xmath104 . with @xmath105",
    "we readily find that @xmath106 though heggie used units in which @xmath107 and so we have restored it in its proper place here .",
    "this formula makes no distinction of the sign of @xmath11 : it appears that hardening and softening encounters are equally likely . but",
    "section  4.3 of @xcite also showed that an application of the principle of detailed balance could be used to estimate the difference in the _ rate _ of hardening and softening encounters .",
    "a similar principle , however , applies to differential cross sections , and we employ it here . from equation  ( a3 ) in @xcite , which is expressed in slightly different notation ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath108 where we have made explicit the dependence of the cross section on the initial semi - major axis of the planet and the initial speed of the passing star . on the left side we are here considering encounters which begin with values @xmath109 and",
    "end with values @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the right side considers information on the time - reversal of such encounters , and so @xmath112 . in the present case , with @xmath113",
    ", we have @xmath114 . substituting for @xmath115 and @xmath111",
    "we deduce that @xmath116 substituting from equation  ( [ eq : delta_impulsive ] ) we deduce that @xmath117 finally , expanding for small @xmath118 , we find that @xmath119    this interesting result shows that hardening encounters are rarer than softening ones . the same qualitative conclusion results from considering non - tidal impulsive encounters , i.e. impulsive encounters in which the passing star approaches the planet or its sun to a distance less than @xmath10 .",
    "for completeness we present here two results for this case drawn from equation ( 4.12 ) in @xcite , but specialized to the present masses and translated into the notation of the present paper .",
    "they are @xmath120 again we find that softening encounters have a higher cross section than hardening encounters .",
    "though these cross sections apply to impulsive encounters , which is a regime of relevance for soft planets , it was pointed out by section  5.1 of @xcite that the results should be roughly applicable also for non - tidal encounters with hard systems , except for a correction due to gravitational focusing .",
    "the passing star is accelerated by the star of the planetary system until its relative velocity becomes comparable with that of the planet . in the case of stellar - mass binaries , which was the application in @xcite ,",
    "the outcome for hardening encounters ( @xmath37 ) is complicated by the possible capture of the passing star .",
    "this does not occur in the case of a planetary system in the limit @xmath101 , and so equation  ( [ eq : delta_non - tidal ] ) does apply roughly ( with the aforementioned correction ) to planetary systems .",
    "it also helps to explain the discovery by @xcite that a planetary system of intermediate binding energy softens on average ( provided that it is not so hard that capture of the passing star is energetically possible ) .",
    "intermediate refers here to a planetary system in the regime @xmath121 , where @xmath52 is the critical velocity according to @xcite and @xmath50 is the orbital velocity of the planet .",
    "we can discuss changes of the binding energy in much the same way that we discussed changes in eccentricity in section  [ sec : d_adiabatic ] .",
    "for the parabolic case , expressions for @xmath11 are given by @xcite and , more explicitly , by roy & haddow ( 2003 ) , while heggie ( 2005 ) extends these to the hyperbolic case .",
    "again we here give only enough to explain the form of the cross sections , and defer further detail to the appendix .",
    "let @xmath64 denote the binding energy of a planetary system , with semi - major axis @xmath122 , and @xmath20 .",
    "then the relative binding energy change @xmath123 for an encounter becomes @xmath124 the definition of @xmath125 can be obtained by comparison with equation  ( [ eq : deps ] ) .",
    "this factor is obtained from the one given by roy & haddow ( 2003 ) , equation  ( 19 ) and heggie ( 2005 ) , equation  ( 11 ) by taking out the factor @xmath126 .",
    "thus our function @xmath127 is of order unity , and depends only on the eccentricity , orientation and phase of the planetary orbit . for the purpose of our paper",
    "only an average over all possible values is of interest , and to order of magnitude we use here @xmath128 .",
    "now we quote the two functions @xmath129 we discuss the functions for the parabolic case @xmath49 and for the extremely hyperbolic case @xmath130 ; for the first one we have @xmath131 , and in this case we reproduce the result of roy & haddow ( 2003 ) . in the hyperbolic limit we have asymptotically @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and so we get @xmath134 as before we have @xmath135 for the hyperbolic case , and in both cases @xmath136 by definition , whence it follows that @xmath137 to compute differential cross sections we need to invert the function @xmath138 , which can be done easily only if the exponential function dominates .",
    "in that case we have @xmath139 where we think of @xmath11 as positive . thus differential cross sections",
    "are obtained in the forms @xmath140    it is shown in appendix  [ sec : delta_cross_sections ] that , to leading order , the full results are @xmath141",
    "we use our hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) scheme as well as direct @xmath0-body simulations to study the changes in the orbital elements of planetary systems induced by encounters in stellar clusters",
    ". the main limitations of the models are that all stars are single ( except for the planetary companions ) , all have equal mass , and there is no stellar evolution .",
    "the main loss of generality is the choice of a specific range of semi - major axis for the planetary orbits .",
    "though we argue below that the range adopted is astrophysically justified , it is one aim of the analytical work to show how the results might be generalized to values outside this range .",
    "we collect data for encounters between stars and planetary systems in different ways in the two models , as described in the following sections .",
    "the initial parameters of @xmath0-body and hmc models are summarized in table  [ tab : constants ] .",
    "the n - body code we use is the publicly available nbody6++ version .",
    "the equations of motion of each planetary system can be treated by regularization .",
    "encounters and perturbations by flybys affect the orbital elements of these regularized pairs , and a sufficiently strong interaction with a passing star can dynamically dissolve the planetary systems .",
    "the only special refinement to mention is that we utilize the newly applied classical method with which secular errors in the integration of close binaries in stellar systems can be strongly reduced ( mikkola & aarseth 1998 ) .    for all models ,",
    "we adopt an isotropic plummer model for the stars initial phase space distribution function .",
    "this model provides a reasonable approximation for open cluster potentials .",
    "all models are in dynamical equilibrium initially .",

    "for all models , the individual mass of stars thus scales with @xmath144 .",
    "planetary masses are set to the constant value of @xmath145 in @xmath0-body units for both the @xmath0-body and hmc models .",
    "this choice ensures that all our planets are practically massless compared to the stellar masses .",
    "physical units are obtained by ( a ) assigning an individual stellar mass ( @xmath146 ) in units of solar masses ( see table  [ tab : constants ] ) to the stars and ( b ) defining 1 pc as one @xmath0-body unit ( this is the virial radius @xmath147 ) .",
    "the length scaling law also fixes what is one @xmath0-body unit in au ( @xmath148 for a system with solar - mass stars and 1 pc identified with one @xmath0-body unit ) .",
    "for all runs done here all stars have equal mass , and there are no stellar binaries initially .",
    "we place one and only one planet around @xmath149 of the stars . for the direct @xmath0-body models we use 20,000 objects , @xmath150 of which are planets , which are randomly attached to 19,000 equal mass single stars , to form a planetary system .",
    "this is a smaller particle number than in the hmc runs ( see below ) .",

    "the eccentricities of our models range from 0.01 ( in model 1 ) to 0.99 ( in model 6 ) .",
    "the use of several different models with different eccentricities has two effects : ( i ) it improves the statistical data for the relatively small particle number ( and relatively small number of scattering events ) in the direct @xmath0-body simulations ; ( ii ) it allows us to consider the dependence of scattering statistics on the planet s orbital eccentricity , and to facilitate a more straightforward comparison with analytic models ( heggie & rasio 1996 , roy & haddow 2003 , heggie 2005 ) . runs e and eh ,",
    "however , cover all initial eccentricities using a thermal eccentricity distribution @xmath152 , which is also adopted in the hmc models . for small @xmath32 s",

    "_ 2007 ) . in all calculations , the initial phase and orientation of the planets orbits , including the direction of their angular momentum vector and their periastron , are randomized in the obvious senses .",
    "the semi major axes of the planets are chosen with a logarithmic distribution , i.e. a constant @xmath153 , between 3  50 au for run e and between 0.03  5 au for run eh . the initial distribution of semi - major axes in the runs e and eh corresponds to the soft and hard planetary systems in the hmc runs , respectively . note that we denote these planetary systems as soft and hard to distinguish between the two types of runs ( with physically wider and closer planetary systems ) .",
    "we would like to remind the reader again here that our definition of hard and soft differs from the dynamical definition of @xcite . according to the dynamical definition",
    "a planetary system is hard if @xmath154 , where @xmath52 is the critical velocity of the three - body system .",

    "in contrast to previous claims ( smith & bonnell 2001 ) , only very few planets escape during the whole simulation - one order of magnitude less than there are free floaters , even though the initial orbital velocity of typical planets is larger than the velocity dispersion of the cluster .    in order to rule out",
    "the possibility that the retention of disrupted planets in the shallow potential of the host cluster may be due to an under - representation of close encounters by the hmc scheme , an analogous model is simulated with the @xmath0-body scheme . in order to compare the rates of free floater and escaper creation between these two approaches , which were obtained for practical and technical reasons with different numbers of particles and planetary systems , we first have to apply an appropriate scaling factor . in our system of @xmath0-body units ( used here for both methods )",
    "the total mass is constant ( unity ) and individual stellar masses scale as @xmath144 .",
    "rates per crossing time scale only by the number of planets , because in @xmath0-body units the cross section , if gravitational focusing prevails , scales inversely proportional to @xmath0 and the stellar number density is proportional to @xmath0 .",

    "the exact scaling expression is given in the caption of table  [ tab : hmcdata ] .",
    "the tables show that both the rates per crossing time per planet , and the ( scaled ) rates per relaxation time agree well , but the numbers differ , in the sense that the rate of free floater creation is larger by some 35 % in the @xmath0-body system .",
    "however , the intrinsic variation of @xmath0-body results for different eccentricities is as large as that , therefore we conclude that our hmc and @xmath0-body results do agree reasonably with each other .",
    "the @xmath0-body result is that approximately 100 dissolutions of planetary systems occur per relaxation time in this case , regardless of their initial eccentricity .",
    "contrary to the standard expectation that highly eccentric planetary systems should be more prone to disruption ( hurley & shara 2002 ) , we find that the disruption rate is essentially insensitive to the planets original eccentricity .",
    "in fact , there is a slight tendency for fewer disruptions , in the case where all planetary systems are initialized with @xmath196 .    in order to understand this puzzling result ,",
    "we have examined the encounter activity between planetary systems and stars in the @xmath0-body models .",
    "we find that , for highly eccentric planetary systems , there is indeed more encounter activity ( e.g. more ks terminations ) by some 40% ( as compared to models with modest eccentricities , e.g. 0.6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , these encounters do not necessarily lead to free - floaters .",
    "after a brief episode of temporary liberation ( ks termination ) , some of the highly eccentric planets quickly become attached to intruding stars .",
    "the exchange of the host stars occurs as a consequence of three- or more - body interaction .",

    "we do notice , however , that softening encounters ( with @xmath264 ) have a higher cross section than hardening encounters , in accordance with the qualitative discussion at the end of section  [ sec : impulse ] .",

    "fig : scatter - soft ] ) , and so the crossover is expected to occur at values of @xmath265 no less than about 0.1 .",
    "it seems likely that the interpretation of the data is complicated by a considerable admixture of encounters which really should be classified as hard .    for relatively large values of @xmath270",

    "suggest that a significant fraction of planets with semi - major axes between 0.03 and 5 au ( hard in our notation , intermediate in that of @xcite ) could have survived stellar encounters in this cluster ( see further discussions below ) .",
    "the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) is an example of a young star cluster with intermediate central density , of order @xmath292 . for this system",
    ", we use a half - mass radius of 0.8 pc and a velocity dispersion of 2.34 km / s , to obtain the half - mass crossing time as @xmath293 yrs . for onc also the half - mass relaxation time ( @xmath294 yrs ) and particle number @xmath295 are provided @xcite .",
    "planetary system lifetimes are then obtained by using our measured lifetimes in units of crossing times ( see table  [ tab : ffdat ] ) .",
    "note that a scaling using the measured half - mass relaxation time of the onc would provide approximately the same results , if the proper coulomb scaling factor is applied to our measured time scales ( in units of relaxation time , see tables  [ tab : hmcdata ] ,  [ tab : nbdata ] ) .    for the hyades cluster , which is a relatively low density open cluster we use the half - mass radius @xmath296 pc and central velocity dispersion of @xmath297 km / s to determine a half - mass crossing time of approx .",
    "@xmath298 yrs @xcite .",
    "again we derive physical timescales in table  [ tab : ffdat ] .",
    "note that these estimates are subject to many uncertainties , such as the use in our models of stars of equal mass .",
    "@xcite provide in their monte carlo simulations cross sections for orbital changes of planetary systems obtained from a large set of simulations of three - body encounters .",
    "we want to compare their results with ours for the case of ionization of planetary systems due to relatively close encounters . for that we use the usual ansatz for the planetary system lifetime as @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the average particle density",
    ", @xmath301 is the total cross section for dissolution of planetary systems , and @xmath8 is the typical encounter relative velocity .",
    "the relevant total cross section for ionization in our case is taken from equation  ( [ eq : delta_non - tidal ] ) for non - tidal impulsive encounters as @xmath302 \\cr f(\\delta ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\delta } \\left ( \\frac{2}{3\\delta } - 1 \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have obtained the total cross section for `` ionization '' by integrating equation  ( [ eq : delta_non - tidal ] ) ( @xmath303 ) from some suitable @xmath304 to @xmath305 . with @xmath306 and",
    "the assumption that @xmath307 ( the minimum required relative energy change for ionization is unity ) we get @xmath308 , thus @xmath309 and @xmath310 this result is in agreement with @xcite in the case of equal stellar masses , although we get for the case of 47 tuc slightly larger values of the planetary lifetimes .",
    "possible reasons are that the distribution of encounter velocities in a real cluster differs from those in three - body experiments , and that planets , which just escape from a three - body encounter with a very small velocity at infinity could easily be recaptured by their own host star or another star due to potential fluctuations .",
    "note that the lifetime of planetary systems as given in equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) does not vary with the particle number @xmath0 , provided the planetary system s semi - major axes remain constant relative to the @xmath0-body scale ( system scaling radius ) , consistent with our numerical results . if one is interested in ionisation time scales relative to the relaxation time we have to look at the quantity @xmath311 where @xmath312 is the coulomb logarithm contained in the relaxation time . if we take the standard coulomb logarithm @xmath313 , with @xmath314 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) we get for the scaling    @xmath315    this is indeed the empirically measured scaling behaviour , as we have commented in the caption to table  [ tab : hmcdata ] .",
    "note that in these considerations , also in the choice of initial conditions for our runs with different particle number ( hmc and @xmath0-body ) we have neglected the possible influence of a separate variation of the planetary orbit scale @xmath10 with respect to the @xmath0-body system s scaling radius @xmath316 . since @xmath317",
    "the effect would be easy to estimate to first order ( if only the size of planetary orbits relative to the cluster size is varied ) .",
    "if however , the scale changes are due to different cluster models ( e.g. king models of different concentration ) further numerical studies would be required .      we have provided a further step towards a self - consistent modelling of the origin of differences in the frequency of planetary systems between star clusters and the galactic field due to encounters of planetary systems with passing stars .",
    "for two representative star clusters with particle numbers resembling open and globular clusters , respectively , we have tested analytical cross sections against two different series of self - consistent numerical simulations under realistic conditions of a star cluster ( not merely a series of three - body scattering experiments ) . for the illustration of our results ,",
    "we have provided liberation time scales for planets ( to become a free floater ) in their respective cluster environment . in contrast to previous work we have extended our study to planetary systems ranging from 0.05 au to 50 au in semi - major axis and all eccentricities . to ease discussion and understanding we divide our planetary systems in two classes ( hard and soft ) , and determine the average time scale for their survival , see table  [ tab : ffdat ] .",
    "we find that the liberation rate of planets per crossing time is constant , and per relaxation time scales with the scaling factor @xmath318 , where @xmath312 is a coulomb logarithm ( provided the planetary system s size remains constant relative to the star cluster radial scale ) .",
    "the results have been applied to three typical cases of clusters , the high - density old globular cluster 47 tuc , the intermediate density young star forming cluster in the orion nebula ( onc ) , and the low - density open cluster of the hyades .",
    "we find that even in the dense environment of 47 tuc about one quarter of the short - period planets survive even after 10 gyrs .",
    "our results are interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "first of all , the diffusive nature of encounters between planetary systems and stars has been confirmed . with the exception of the few close encounters most intermediate and distant encounters have no preferred sign of change for the orbital parameters of the planet .",
    "therefore planets can be scattered onto a more eccentric orbit , even if they are initially very close to the host star .",
    "subsequent evolution of such planets by tidal effects may lead to their inflation and tidal disruption .",
    "this process is expected to be particularly effective in dense globular clusters .",
    "therefore it is not guaranteed that the fraction of surviving systems we have found for the case of 47 tuc would be observable - it may just be destroyed by secondary processes such as tidal interactions . here",
    "we have just rescaled from our exemplary model simulations to the particle number and mass of 47 tuc ; a detailed case study of 47 tuc would require a model using the half - mass radius and concentration parameter properly tailored so as to reproduce the presently observed values .",
    "also , a more detailed case study of 47 tuc would require as well to include a stellar mass spectrum , stellar evolution , some binary fraction .",
    "this is subject of future work and beyond the scope of this first exploratory study .",
    "in contrast to the less - rich taurus star forming region , the onc contains massive stars similar to the hypothetical progenitors which generated the radioactive isotopes prior to the formation of the solar system .",
    "this and other , slightly less rich associations are also likely to disperse in @xmath319 myr rather than evolve into an open cluster .",
    "the main issue here is whether the planet - bearing stars can preserve their companions before joining the field star population .",
    "our numerical results indicate that in the onc a few times @xmath320 years is a critical threshold for the survival of wider planets and planetary systems such as the solar system .",
    "thus , the disruption of some planetary systems is expected , especially near the region where dense protostellar cores are concentrated . these are also the regions where the existence of free floaters have been reported .",
    "our models suggest that a significant fraction of the free - floater population may represent the relics of disrupted planetary systems .",
    "our results also indicate that the velocity dispersion of the freely floating planets must be generally small , as most are retained by the cluster potential , at least for the case of soft planets ( tables [ tab : hmcdata ] and [ tab : nbdata ] ) .",
    "finally , for open clusters such as the hyades , there is no problem in preventing all the planetary systems ( wide or compact ) from destruction before the cluster dissolves on a gyr time scale .",
    "the observed dichotomy in the fraction of stars with planets between the field stars and the hyades requires additional explanation .",
    "the present - day age of the hyades is @xmath321 0.8 gyr .",
    "it is likely that the cluster was somewhat denser in the past which would shorten the planetary - system disruption time scale below that listed in table  [ tab : ffdat ] .",
    "a more compact young hyades would also reduce its @xmath273 below its lifespan .",
    "both eccentricity excitation and modest migration would shake up otherwise stable planetary systems .",
    "if systems are driven into nearly resonant configurations , modest eccentricity excitation can render them dynamically unstable .",
    "we have not yet taken into account the dynamics of multi - planetary systems in our model , but this subject will be addressed in our future investigations .",
    "last , but not least , stellar encounters with planetary system can alter the eccentricity of orbits with relatively large semi - major axes efficiently , and also they are the only process which can create significant amounts of inclinations out of the original orbital plane of the planetary system ( though we have not considered that issue in this paper ) .",
    "these properties are potentially important for understanding the formation of kuiper - belt objects .",
    "we have neglected for the present paper the effect of stellar binaries and multiples , as well as that of a stellar mass spectrum .",
    "in particular the presence of a large number of binaries would be expected to have a profound effect through the action of binary system - planetary system encounters .",
    "the inclusion of binary stars would certainly reduce the magnitude of @xmath273 and the key issue is by what extent .",
    "also a further study of the free floaters in globular and open clusters is interesting . due to their very small mass",
    "they can not receive large amounts of energy in the mass segregation - equipartition processes structuring the cluster during its dynamical evolution .",
    "therefore large numbers of free floating planets should be retained in the cluster , a conclusion in conflict at least with present observations . from the point of view of escape",
    ", free - floating planets would behave very much like low - mass stars .",
    "there is much observational and theoretical evidence that low - mass objects escape preferentially from star clusters , especially in the presence of steady and time - dependent tidal fields .",
    "mass segregation tends to drive such objects to large radii , where they may be efficiently removed by tidal effects . to study",
    "the fate of a component of very low - mass planetary objects during the standard evolution of star cluster is another interesting future project .",
    "we conclude that , for an understanding of the diversity of planetary systems , the fact that they originate in a dense star cluster can not be neglected .",
    "our solar system could have formed in an open cluster or in the outskirts of an object which evolved from an onc like star cluster .",
    "other processes shaping planetary systems , such as resonances , and interaction with gas , need to be distinguished from the effect of diffusive encounters .",

    "we present formulae for the change in binding energy and eccentricity of a binary as a result of scattering by a distant third body .",

    "we assume that the encounter between the host and field stars occurs on a much longer time scale than the planet s orbital period .",

    "long ago heggie ( 1975 ) , equation  ( 5.66 ) , derived a formula for the change in eccentricity of a binary subject to a parabolic flyby of a third body . corrected for an overall sign error , it is : @xmath322 where @xmath32 is the eccentricity , @xmath17 is the mass of the perturber , @xmath323 is the total mass of the binary , @xmath324 is the total mass of the system , @xmath10 is the ( initial ) semi - major axis of the binary , @xmath7 is the distance of closest approach between the perturber and the centre of mass of the binary ( on a keplerian approximation ) , @xmath325 is a unit vector along the pericentre of the binary , @xmath326 is an orthogonal unit vector in the plane of motion of the binary ( so that @xmath327 is directed along the angular momentum vector of the binary ) , @xmath328 is a unit vector along the pericentre of the third body , and @xmath329 is an orthogonal unit vector in the plane of motion of the third body ( so that @xmath330 is directed along the angular momentum vector of the relative motion of the third body and the binary ) .",

    "roy and haddow ( 2003 ) also provided an expression for the energy change of a circular binary in the case of parabolic flyby .",

    "here our starting point is an expression for the total change , due to the passing star , in the specific angular momentum @xmath65 of the planet relative to its sun .",

    "we have specialised to the case of equal stellar mass and negligible planetary mass .    in the tidal regime",
    "we expand in powers of @xmath357 , obtaining to lowest order @xmath358 where @xmath359 is the unit vector parallel to @xmath356 .",

    "remarkably , we do not need to evaluate it in order to obtain the cross section to lowest order . using equation  ( [ eq : deps - p ] ) in the parabolic limit",
    ", we deduce that @xmath409 where the factor of @xmath410 in the second expression is needed because the geometric factor @xmath84 has the correct sign in only half of all encounters . differentiating with respect to @xmath11",
    ", we can ignore the derivative of @xmath84 ; @xmath84 depends on powers of @xmath7 or @xmath25 and hence on powers of @xmath411 , as we can see from equation  ( [ eq : sigma_working ] ) , and so it varies much more slowly than @xmath11 .",
    "similarly we can neglect @xmath412 by comparison with @xmath118 for sufficiently weak encounters .",
