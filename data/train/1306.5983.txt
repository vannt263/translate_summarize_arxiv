    "in the last few years considerable research has been done in the light propagation in parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetric optical media @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0-symmetric optical structures deliberately exploit the quantum mechanical notion of parity @xmath1 and time reversal @xmath2 symmetry of a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "non - hermitian hamiltonian having unbroken @xmath0-symmetry possesses entirely real and positive energy eigenvalues and may constitute a physically viable system without violating any of the axioms of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "in fact , some @xmath0-symmetric complex hamiltonians has a threshold above which the corresponding energy eigenvalues become complex and the system undergoes a phase transition because of spontaneous breaking of @xmath0-symmetry @xcite . for the realization of the mathematical concept of @xmath0-symmetry in real settings , one can make use of the quantum - optical analogy that the linear propagation equation derived for optical beams in the paraxial approximation is formally equivalent to the quantum mechanical schrdinger equation . in optics",
    "@xmath0-symmetric structures have been constructed by judiciously incorporating balanced gain and loss profile in the refractive index distribution . for such settings",
    "it is necessary that the complex refractive index obeys the condition @xmath3 i.e. , the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index profiles must be symmetric and anti - symmetric functions of the transverse coordinate @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "optical systems endowed with this symmetry are known to exhibit previously unattainable distinctive light propagation features such as power oscillation , band merging , double refraction , abrupt phase transitions , non reciprocity @xcite , unidirectional invisibility @xcite , mode selection in @xmath0-symmetric lasers @xcite , as well as existence of coherent lasing absorbing modes @xcite .",
    "+ a natural extension of the analysis of the linear @xmath0-symmetric structures is the investigation of the existence and stability of the optical solitons in a variety of nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems . in the nonlinear domain , a class of both the one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) localized modes , of the nonlinear schrdinger like equation ( nls ) in the presence of kerr nonlinearity ,",
    "are found below and above the @xmath0 threshold of the external potential @xcite .",
    "the effect of nonlinearity on the stability of the fundamental spatial solitons is investigated in a number of complex potentials e.g. complex @xmath0-symmetric periodic @xcite , hyperbolic scarf @xcite , gaussian @xcite , bessel @xcite , and parabolic potentials @xcite .",
    "the presence of gap solitons in competing cubic - quintic media @xcite , defect nonlinear modes in linear lattice @xcite , gray solitons @xcite and multi - pole solitons @xcite in kerr nonlinear media in the presence of extended gain / loss are reported . the existence of dark soliton and vortices described by a harmonic trap with a rapidly decaying @xmath0-symmetric imaginary component in the presence of defocusing nonlinearity is also studied @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 dipole embeded into the kerr nonlinear medium has been shown to admit a full family of analytical soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spatial and temporal solitons and their stability in the @xmath0-symmetric coupler with balanced gain / loss are examined in @xcite . in most of these events",
    "the complex potentials have localized ( asymptotically vanishing ) imaginary part which render the associated solitons to propagate stably under appropriate restriction on the gain / loss parameter . in a recent study @xcite",
    ", however , we have shown that the nonlinear modes in a complex rosen - morse potential well are always unstable although spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0-symmetry is absent in such system .",
    "the reason behind this is that the gain / loss profile for such systems is asymptotically non - vanishing and any small fluctuations of the initial field are amplified which leads to the instability .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the optical beam propagation in a single @xmath0 cell which is characterized by the nonlinear schrdinger equation with a generic complex hyperbolic potential ( given in equation ( [ e2 ] ) ) with competing gain and loss profile .",
    "the motivation behind the study of the present model is two fold .",
    "the first one is that the beam dynamics in a single @xmath0 potential is useful to understand the light self trapping in complex optical lattices .",
    "most importantly , one can investigate the effect of asymptotically vanishing and non - vanishing gain and loss profiles on the stable propagation of solitons in the same framework by considering the special cases of the competing parameter @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , the class of potentials considered here belongs to the set of few potentials for which the nls equation admits analytical localized solutions .",
    "we find that exact analytical expression of the spatial localized modes can be obtained for all values of the competing parameter and in the presence of self focusing and self - defocusing kerr nonlinearity . the linear stability analysis followed by the direct numerical simulation",
    "have been performed to study the stability of these localized modes .",
    "emphasis has been given to the cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 to investigate the effect of competing parameter on the stability structure of the solitons supported by the asymptotically vanishing and non - vanishing gain / loss profiles , respectively .",
    "the spatial localized modes in two - dimensions as well as the transverse power - flow density associated with these localized modes are also discussed .",
    "consider the optical beam propagation along longitudinal @xmath8 axis in a kerr nonlinear media with a transverse complex @xmath0-symmetric refractive index distribution .",
    "the dynamics of the beam is governed by the @xmath9-dimensional nls equation with external potential @xcite @xmath10 \\psi + \\sigma |\\psi|^2 \\psi = 0 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is proportional to the electric field envelop , and @xmath12 corresponds to a self - focusing nonlinearity and @xmath13 to a defocusing one .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the real and imaginary parts of the complex potential which satisfies the @xmath0-symmetry i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , in the context of optics , @xmath14 determines the bending and slowing down of light , and @xmath15 is responsible for either amplification or absorption of light within an optical material .",
    "here we investigate optical beam propagation in a single @xmath0 cell which is characterized by the following class of complex potential with competing gain and loss profile @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath21 are the amplitude of the real part of the potential , @xmath22 is proportional to the strength of the imaginary part and @xmath23 is the competing parameter .",
    "each value of @xmath5 gives rise to a new potential whose functional forms are different .",
    "specifically , the nature of the gain and loss profile @xmath15 depends much on @xmath5 : @xmath15 becomes asymptotically non vanishing for @xmath24 , whereas non zero values of @xmath5 make @xmath15 to localize ( asymptotically vanishing ) .",
    "the stationary solution of the nonlinear equation ( [ e1 ] ) can be obtained by assuming @xmath25 , where the complex valued function @xmath26 describes , in general , the soliton and @xmath27 is the real propagation constant .",
    "substitution of this expression of @xmath11 and the potential ( [ e2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) yield an ordinary nonlinear differential equation of @xmath26 : @xmath28 \\phi + \\sigma |\\phi|^2 \\phi = \\beta \\phi , \\label{e3}\\ ] ] which can be solved numerically by applying the boundary conditions @xmath29 for sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote ` real ' and ` imaginary ' respectively .",
    "however , in the following we have shown that the equation ( [ e3 ] ) admits analytical localized solution for both the self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities .      to obtain the analytical expression of the localized modes to equation ( [ e3 ] ) , we assume @xmath32 where two unknown quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be determined shortly . substituting the above expression of @xmath26 in equation ( [ e3 ] ) and then separating out the real and imaginary parts we have @xmath35 now , one can easily solve the above two equations to obtain @xmath36 and hence the analytical localized solution of the equation ( [ e3 ] ) is reduced to @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "similar approach can be applied to find other localized solutions of the equation ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "specifically , for @xmath40 , the equation ( [ e3 ] ) is found to admit another analytical solution of the form @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . however , the first solution given in equation ( [ e4 ] ) is valid for all nonnegative real values of @xmath5 including @xmath44 .",
    "therefore we shall consider the solution ( [ e4 ] ) in the remaining part of the paper to investigate the effect of both @xmath44 and @xmath40 on the stable propagation of such solutions . in order to probe physical properties of these localized solutions",
    "we shall examine following three quantities : the total power @xmath45 , the transverse power ( poynting vector ) @xmath46 across the beam and the linear stability analysis of those localized modes . in the present case ,",
    "the total power is calculated as @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that the power is independent of the competing parameter @xmath5 and remains positive for @xmath48 .",
    "the transverse power or energy flow of light field accross the beam is given by @xmath49 .",
    "obviously @xmath46 depends on the competing parameter @xmath5 and it remains positive for positive values of @xmath50 and @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that the power flow in the @xmath0 cell is unidirectional i.e. from gain towards loss region .    in order to investigate the effect of the competing gain and loss profile on the linear stability properties of the self - trapped nonlinear modes obtained here , we consider small perturbation to the solution @xmath11 , in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath51 ~e^{\\delta z } + [ f^*(x ) -g^*(x)]~ e^{\\delta^ * z}\\right\\ }   e^{i \\beta z}\\label{e30}\\ ] ] where superscript @xmath52 represents the complex conjugation , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the infinitesimal perturbation eigen - functions which may grow upon propagation with the perturbation growth rate @xmath55 . substituting the perturbed solution into eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and linearizing it around the stationary solution @xmath26 , one obtains a coupled set of linear eigenvalue equations : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this coupled equations can be solved numerically with the help of fourier collocation method @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of a soliton is determined by the nature of the spectrum of the above eigenvalue problem ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "if there exist any @xmath55 with a positive real part , the perturbed solution ( [ e30 ] ) would grow exponentially with @xmath8 and thus corresponding solitons become linearly unstable . on the other hand stationary solutions can be completely stable only when all real parts of @xmath55 are equal to zero .    in the following we consider some particular values of @xmath5 for which the hypergeometric function ( appeared in the phase of the solution [ e4 ] ) can be expressed in closed analytical form .",
    "for numerical computation we have also restricted ourself in the self focusing nonlinearity @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "self defocusing case @xmath61 is discussed in subsequent section . for each of the particular choices of @xmath5",
    ", we have numerically investigated the linear stability analysis of the corresponding localized modes for arbitrary values of gain and loss parameter @xmath50 .",
    "we find that for @xmath6 the localized modes are unstable for all @xmath50 .",
    "whereas in other cases , considered here , stable propagation is obtained below a certain value of @xmath50 .",

    "<S> the existence and stability of the nonlinear spatial localized modes are investigated in parity - time symmetric optical media characterized by a generic complex hyperbolic refractive index distribution with competing gain and loss profile . </S>",
    "<S> the exact analytical expression of the localized modes are found for all values of the competing parameter and in the presence of both the self - focusing and self - defocusing kerr nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of competing gain / loss profile on the stability structure of these localized modes are discussed with the help of linear stability analysis followed by the direct numerical simulation of the governing equation . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial localized modes in two - dimensional geometry as well as the transverse power - flow density associated with these localized modes are also examined . </S>"
