    "the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory  @xcite , proposed in 1950 , is perhaps the most successful macroscopic description of superconductivity , proceeding the famous phenomenological description of the electromagnetic field in a superconductor by the london brothers  @xcite .",
    "the proposed macroscopic quantum theory by ginzburg and landau makes use of a quartic potential and the higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite to generate a local mass term of the vector potential . as such",
    ", it successfully describes the meissner - ochsenfeld effect  @xcite , for the magnetic field flux expulsion , the phenomenology associated with the phase transition  @xcite , and also predicts the existence of a coherence length in superconductors , resulting from the local scalar order field fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , in 1957 , abrikosov @xcite predicted the penetration of strong magnetic fields in type - ii superconductors through quantum vortices , giving farther credibility to the gl model .",
    "the gl - theory can be regarded nowadays as the three - dimensional version of the 3 + 1-dimensional scalar quantum electrodynamics , studied in detail by coleman and weinberg @xcite , in the early seventies , as an attempt to generate the scalar field mass through radiative corrections .",
    "the size limitations and effects in superconductivity have been under study for several decades  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", a new method is developed to derive the approximate size limit of type - ii superconductors in the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the application of the ginzburg - landau theory is , first and foremost , constrained by the magnitude of the coherence length , below which such a macroscopic theory is no longer valid .",
    "however , for type - ii superconductors , with small coherence lengths , the quantum fluctuations may become significant enough to impose a new physical limit to superconductivity , above the coherence length .",
    "in addition to this , the ginzburg - landau theory , in the london approximation , shall only be applied to type - ii superconductors with large gl parameters , also known as `` clean '' superconductors , as opposed to type - i superconductors , yielding non - local effects , where the pippard s model must be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a macroscopic massive scalar higgs - like field pervading the superconducting region in the ginzburg - landau theory , corresponding to the collective excitation of the cooper pairs in the lattice  @xcite , implies the existence of a ground - state energy resulting from the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field between the superconductor walls .",
    "while for macroscopic superconductors , these fluctuations are usually negligible as the scalar field behaves continuously in the classical approximation , they become relevant for small sized superconductors , leading to a discretization of energy levels , and therefore , of the supercurrents as well . in particular , for small superconductor , the ground state energy is expected to increase , eventually to the point where it surpasses the condensation energy and restores the vacuum symmetry of the gl potential .",
    "these quantum fluctuations can be parameterized by a quadratic approximation around the minimum of the potential , leading to the klein - gordon equation for the scalar field . therefore",
    ", the ground - state and the allowed energy levels can be directly extracted from the klein - gordon solutions for the scalar field in a box .",
    "such approximation is , of course , limited to small fluctuations , but may also be extrapolated to large fluctuations , in order to provide an interesting lower limit on the size of superconductors .",
    "the ginzburg - landau ground - state energies , derived from the klein - gordon solutions , and the corresponding size limits predictions at absolute zero and near the critical temperature , are presented in this letter . in particular , as the condensation energy vanishes near the second - order phase transition , the lower size limit increases , possibly reaching macroscopic dimensions .",
    "at zero kelvin , the hamiltonian of the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity can be written as : @xmath0 with the order parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are real fields , @xmath4 is the electric charge of the cooper pairs , and the real constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 give the strength of the quadratic and quartic terms , respectively . the vector field",
    "is represented by @xmath7 .",
    "the ground state of the potential , @xmath8 , is particularly interesting for a negative mass parameter @xmath5 , @xmath9 corresponding to an infinite number of degenerate states .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , _ i.e. _ fixing the gauge to @xmath10 , the energy density becomes @xmath11 the mass term of the vector field , resulting from the spontaneous symmetry breaking , and also known as the meissner - higgs mass term  @xcite , suppresses the magnetic field inside , with a corresponding london penetration length , @xmath12 on the other hand , the scalar field mass term can be associated with the coherence length , @xmath13 finally , the thermodynamic critical magnetic field can also be extracted from the condensation energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the necessary energy to restore the vacuum symmetry , which leads to @xmath14 at finite temperature near @xmath15 , the quadratic parameter varies linearly with the temperature , @xmath16",
    "as mentioned before , the quartic potential of the ginzburg - landau theory can be approximated to a parabola around the expectation value , by expanding it to the second order of taylor series , @xmath17 where the fluctuations around the expectation value can be expressed in terms of a higgs - like field , .",
    "the quadratic approximation around the expectation value is represented in figure [ size ] .        in the particular case of small dimensions superconductors , where significant quantum fluctuations arise , the four - dimensional version of the ginzburg - landau theory ,",
    "the coleman - weinberg model , comprising time dependencies , becomes a more accurate description .",
    "assuming there is no external magnetic field , and the internal contributions to the electromagnetic field are too small , the dynamics of the scalar higgs field in the quadratic approximation of the coleman - weinberg model results in the following time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath18 as such , in this approximation , the dynamic equation for the scalar field simplifies to a klein - gordon equation , @xmath19 it should be stressed , however , that this approximation is more favorable for temperatures near criticality , rather than at zero kelvin , as the expectation value of the higgs potential approaches to zero giving rise to a second order phase transition . in any case , it provides a good estimate on the magnitude of the ground - state energy one shall expect in such potential , even at low temperature .",
    "the plane wave solutions for the higgs - like field are , therefore , of the type , @xmath20 where @xmath21 . in the particular case the scalar field is constrained to a small sized three - dimensional box , like in a superconductor with small dimensions , the different energy levels are given by the solutions for the free particle of the infinite square potential  @xcite , @xmath22 in the particular case the box dimensions are much larger than the coherence length ( @xmath23 ) , the second term in equation ( [ energylevels ] ) becomes less relevant .",
    "note that this condition is necessary to keep the validity of the ginzburg - landau theory intact in this regime . as a result ,",
    "the kinetic component of the ground - state energy is approximately given by the non - relativist limit , @xmath24",
    "in small superconductors , but still larger than the coherence length , as the ground - state energy arises , it may surpass the condensation energy and restore the vacuum symmetry .",
    "as such , one can establish a limit on the size of the superconductor by imposing that the energy density of its ground - state is equal to the condensation energy , @xmath25 which leads to , @xmath26 or , @xmath27 at zero kelvin , the size limit of a superconductor in the ginzburg - landau theory depends on both the coherence and penetration lengths , prominently on the first .",
    "for that reason , this result is only valid for clean superconductors with a ginzburg - landau parameter  @xcite much larger than one , @xmath28 , so that the minimum allowed scale can be at least one order of magnitude larger than the coherence length , enabling the validity of the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "on the other hand , as the quadratic term vanishes near criticality , the ground - state energy of the scalar field at finite temperature in this regime is no longer in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath29 as a result , the minimal allowed scale in the ginzburg - landau theory near the critical temperature is , @xmath30 or , @xmath31 it should be noted , as well , that since the minimum allowed scale near criticality also depends on both the coherence length and the london penetration depth , its temperature dependence near the critical temperature is expected to increase at a smaller rate than the coherence length . as such , the validity of this model is quite questionable for temperatures extremely close to the criticality , even in clean superconductors .",
    "the lower size limits of clean high - temperature superconductors were derived in the framework of the ginzburg - landau theory at zero kelvin and near the critical temperature .",
    "the existence of a ground - state for the scalar higgs - like field was predicted and derived , and compared with the condensation energy for extremely small superconductors . as result ,",
    "the minimum allowed scale was found to depend on both the coherence length and the london penetration depth in both regimes , within the range of applicability of this model , limiting it to clean high - temperature superconductors .",
    "as the experimental results on the size limits of clean high - temperature superconductors are , to the best of our knowledge , currently quite limited , we would like to challenge experimental groups to test the predicted results obtained with this model .",
    "a concurrent result would provide additional to the already successful ginzburg - landau theory , while the opposite would oblige further scrutiny on its range of validity",
