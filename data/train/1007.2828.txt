    "we note that the normalized strength of the interpulse around phase 0.2 comparing to the main pulse around phase 0.5 increased significantly but the third peak around phase 0.8 appears to vanish entirely from january to march .",
    "since the center of the source in all the pc mode observations is `` pile - up '' that leads to detector saturation , the central source photons has already been eliminated in the clean image . in order to avoid the pronounced depression of counts in the center of our target , we therefore directly downloaded the spectral products of pc mode observations from the uk _ swift _ science data centre ( www.swift.ac.uk/user@xmath26objects/ ) .",

    "because of a strong absorption feature around 0.5 kev , which is associated with the oxygen edge @xcite , we only fitted our spectra in the 0.510 kev band using xspec 12.5.1 and rebinned the data with a minimum of 50 counts per bin to ensure @xmath22 statistics .",
    "we produced a phase - averaged spectrum for each pc and wt observation with enough exposures to generate more than 30 degrees of freedom in statistics for spectral fit .",
    "among all the investigations , we applied a single power - law model to represent the main non - thermal emission of the accretion column/ outer gap ( table  [ ntspresult ] & table  [ psspresult ] ) and a single blackbody model to indicate the thermal emission contributed by the hot spot of the neutron star ( table  [ tspresult ] & table  [ psspresult ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath27 of the result is larger than 1 , an additional component is required to improve the fit .",

    "the best - fit spectral parameters of different models are all given with the errors at 90% confidence level .",
    "for all observations , a single power - law model can not provide a reasonable fit as demonstrated in table  [ ntspresult ] ( except for the observation of january 06 ) . on the other hand , a single blackbody model can provide an acceptable fit ( table  [ tspresult ] & ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ accept_fit ] ) for the data observed in january when we took account the systematic uncertainties caused by calibrations ( fig .",
    "[ poor_fit ] ) .",
    "the spectra with long exposures seem to have worse statistics than those with short exposures .",
    "this might be caused by the complicated absorption features associated with the response matrices @xcite . a composite model with both power - law and blackbody",
    "can be fitted with the extracted spectra in march ; however , the photon index ( @xmath28 ) is too soft compared with other x - ray binary pulsars ( xbps ) and the inferred luminosity in the range 0.310  kev will exceed the eddington luminosity .",
    "a composite model can also fit most of the spectra in january , but the associated photon index of the power - law component is still too soft and the main contribution is dominated by the blackbody component .",
    "we therefore ignore the contribution from the power - law for all the spectra and only considered a single / composite model with the blackbody component(s ) to explain the spectral behavior .",
    "two - blackbody components can improve the spectral fit during the outburst . for obsid 3 and 5 in wt mode , an f - test shows that the additional soft component during the outburst is significant at @xmath29 .",
    "but for the other 3 observations in january , an additional soft blackbody component does not improve the fits significantly . in contrary , for the observations detected after the flaring in march ,",
    "a two - blackbody model fits significantly better than a single blackbody one in table  [ tspresult ] ( ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ accept_fit ] ) . however , we note the wt spectra in obsid 1 , 2 & 4 can be described by an acceptable single blackbody model with much shorter exposures than the other observations .",
    "it is unclear whether the single blackbody fits might be due to the larger statistical uncertainty in shorter exposures .",
    "however , the single blackbody component fits with long exposures in january are still much better than the single blackbody component fits of march observations .",
    "this indicates the variation of the spectral behavior might be real .",
    "we also note that the fitting parameters of jan 04 observations ( obsid 1 & 2 ) are very different .",
    "this might be caused by the fact that the fitting parameter of the hydrogen absorption is very sensitive to the soft band spectrum if the the photon counts are low ; a very small variation of the spectrum at soft band will result in a complete different hydrogen absorption , which will then cause a large variation in other fitting parameters . for the spectra of jan",
    "04 observations ( obsid 1 & 2 ) , if we fixed the hydrogen absorption to be @xmath30  @xmath31 , the obsid 1 & 2 of the wt mode observations can both be fitted by a single blackbody model with @xmath32  kev , r  = @xmath33  km with @xmath34 with 69 d.o.f and @xmath35  kev , r  = @xmath36  km with @xmath37 with 37 d.o.f .",
    "the variations of the parameters between these two spectra with the fixed hydrogen absorption are much smaller than those listed in the table  [ tspresult ] .",
    "this indicates that the huge variations of the polar cap temperatures and radius within the same day may not be real .",
    "for all the spectra extracted in march , only the second spectrum of march 14 ( obsid 10 ) does not provide an acceptable fit with a two - blackbody model ; this might be due to the serious nickel contamination at 78  kev that is not fully subtracted from the calibration and many absorption features .",
    "some of the features are caused by the instrumental effects as shown by @xcite ; however , the true spectra of the source might be much more complicated than our models and the instrumental effects probably do not explain all the poor fits to the data .",
    "to further study the emission from the neutron star , we also generated the pulsed spectrum of 1a 1118615 with the data observed in the wt mode .",
    "we divided each observation into pulsed and unpulsed emission depending on their pulsed phase shown in fig .",
    "[ psfile ] . the light curve of 1a 1118615",
    "was folded with 32 bins and we assign the phase from 0.375 to 0.90625 ( 12th  29th of 32 bins ) to be the pulsed phase of the 407.69 s period and the phase from 0.125 to 0.75 ( 4th  24th of 32 bins ) to be the pulsed phase of the 407.26 s one .",
    "we also used the same criterion to estimate all the pulsed photons in 0.310 kev for each data listed in table  [ oblog ] . to get enough counts for pulsed spectral fits , all the pulsed spectra in january and march",
    "were combined into a january spectrum and march one respectively .",
    "the associated ancillary response files were also combined with weightings depending on the relative exposures ( shown in table  [ oblog ] ) .",
    "the pulsed spectrum was then obtained by subtracting the unpulsed emission from the pulsed emission . according to table  [ tspresult ] , the average hydrogen absorption in the best fit to a single blackbody spectrum obtained at the outburst stage in january is @xmath30  @xmath31 and is @xmath38  @xmath31 to a two blackbody spectrum after the flare detection in march . in the fits to the pulsed spectra , we fixed these values to associate with the pulsed - average spectra ( table  [ psspresult ] ) .",
    "the difference of the absorption can be caused by the possibility that the absorber is related to the different amounts and/or the viewing angle of the material accreted by the pulsar along the line - of - sight .",
    "the pulsed spectra of january and march can not be well fitted by a single power - law , and we can not find any evidence of the non - thermal emission from each phase - averaged spectrum . however , a single blackbody model can be applied to the pulsed spectra in january and march at 0.510  kev with @xmath39  kev , @xmath40  km with @xmath41 and @xmath42  kev , @xmath43  km with @xmath44 .",
    "the inferred pulsed flux is @xmath45  ergs @xmath31 s@xmath46 in january and @xmath47  ergs @xmath31 s@xmath46 in march .",
    "the decrease of the luminosity might be caused by the cooling of the surface temperature .",
    "according to _ ariel v _ @xcite , _ cgro_/batse @xcite and _ swift_/bat observations , the time separation of @xmath18 17 years between the detection of each outburst for 1a 1118615 suggests that the neutron star does not interact violently with the massive companion during most of the orbit @xcite . if the outburst is only caused by the approaching of the neutron star to the periastron , the long time separations of the outbursts indicate a very flat elliptical orbit",
    ".    however , the orbital periods for known be / xbps range from several days ( a  053866 ; @xcite ) to hundred of days ( x1145619 ; @xcite ) and no other convincing evidence can connect this long time separation to be the orbital period of 1a 1118615 .",
    "the time separation of @xmath18 1 month between the outburst of 2009 january detected by _",
    "swift_/xrt and the flare of 2009 february detected by _",
    "integral _ might also indicate a possible orbital period .",
    "one major concern is that we would expect to have observed much more flares during the interval of 17 years or at least more than one flares after the main outburst if the orbital period was only around 1 month .",
    "in addition , each main outburst detected every 17 years is the normal outbursts ( type i , 10@xmath48  10@xmath49",
    "erg / s ) .",
    "however , we would expect to observe a giant burst for a long recurrence interval ( type ii , @xmath50 erg / s ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the orbital period for 1a  1118615 is 17 years , this binary system will have the longest orbital period than all the other known be / xbps shown by @xcite .",
    "we would expect to observe some evidences of the passage of the neutron star during the periastron in other wave bands .",
    "@xcite found that the equivalent width of h@xmath6 varied on very short time scales around the outburst of 1992 ; this can be explained as the disruption of the circumstellar disk caused by the passage of the neutron star during the periastron .",
    "this indicates that the assumption of the 17-year orbital period is consistent with the h@xmath6 equivalent width variation .",
    "further optical investigations and the study of high - energy emission mechanism of this be / x - ray transient may help us to verify the orbital period and solve the related mystery .",
    "the pulsation in january was measured during the outburst while in march it was detected after the flare detection of february .",
    "the pulsations of 1a  1118615 , shown in fig .",
    "[ psfile ] , obviously demonstrate that the pulsar has spun - up during the period between the outburst and flare events .",
    "the pulse periods do not show variation during the different observations of january and march respectively . as a result",
    "it is unclear whether the outburst or flare is responsible for the spinning - up of the pulsar .",
    "but the change of the pulse profile for 1a 1118615 may relate to the decrease of the pulsed luminosity ; similar luminosity dependencies were also claimed for cen x-3 @xcite , lmc x-4 @xcite and exo 2030 + 375 @xcite . in the evolution of the pulse profile for exo 2030 + 375 following the first outburst decay , an interpulse appeared and became stronger as the luminosity decreased from the maximum and this trend continued until the main pulse had become entirely disappeared .",
    "then the profile became dominated by the contribution from the interpulse .",
    "the same luminosity dependence was also evident for 1a  1118615 .",
    "the pulse profiles of 1a 1118615 show features similar to those of exo 2030 + 375 @xcite ; the pulsed luminosity decreased and the normalized strength of the interpulse became significant relative to the main pulse after the flaring .",
    "a long term survey is needed to further examine the dependence of the pulse profile and x - ray luminosity .    according to table  [ tspresult ]",
    ", a single blackbody model can provide an acceptable fit with a temperature of @xmath51  kev and a small hot spot radius ( @xmath52  km ; assuming a source distance of 4 kpc ; @xcite ) for most of the data observed in the outburst .",
    "the thermal emission can be attributed to the ionized photons or the collision of the heated gas ; however , the most plausible origin is from the surface ( polar cap ) emission of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a clear physical picture to show the emitting process during the accretion . in this picture , the radius of the accreting polar cap is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the radius of the neutron star , typically assumed to be 10 km . in contrary to the spectra of most xbps @xcite , we did not find any obvious evidence of a main non - thermal contribution . instead of x - rays emitted from the accretion column or outer gap , we detected strong emission from a surface layer .",
    "this x - ray contribution during the outburst can be originated from the thermal emission around the compact source , which is similar to the polar cap emission of an isolated neutron star .",
    "the second thermal feature ( @xmath55 & @xmath56 ) resembles the x - rays from the inner edge of an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "this additional soft characteristic may become an important component when the pulsed flux of the source weakens .",
    "such x - ray thermal contributions are always observed in the bright xbps with luminosity @xmath57   10@xmath58  ergs / s @xcite , but the source luminosity of 1a 1118615 in 0.5  10 kev observed by _",
    "swift_/xrt is only @xmath59  ergs  s@xmath46 .",
    "our results might indicate that the soft excess contributed by the emission from the inner disk can generally be observed for the xbps after flaring , not only for the bright targets .",
    "if the variation of the second thermal component is real , our spectral analyses in different time intervals may indicate that the surface ( polar cap ) emission of the neutron star dominates the observed x - rays from 1a 1118615 at the beginning of outburst .",
    "the fact that the thermal emission contributed by the accretion disk becomes significant at another specific time interval may represent that a different violent radiation process starts in one month and may be also associated with the flare detection .",
    "although the average source luminosity in different time intervals only changes by a small fraction , the cooling of temperature in the similar polar cap area clearly exhibit a decay of the surface emission from the neutron star .",
    "the decrease of the pulsed emission derived from our phase - resolved spectrum also supports this viewpoint .",
    "the parameters of the neutron star and the properties of the orbital motion for the binary system , 1a  1118615 , are not well understood .",
    "furthermore , the possible orbital period of @xmath60  yr is extremely large compared with 100  days for the typical be / xbps with long spin period .",
    "therefore , it will be worth examining the parameters of the neutron star and orbital motion for further discussion on this unique high - mass x - ray binary system .",
    "the increasing x - ray emission at the outburst stage in january of 2009 allowed us to find a rotation period of @xmath61 sec . on the other hand , a rotation period of @xmath62  sec",
    "was reported by _",
    "observation on august 21 of 2003 in the quiescence stage of the source @xcite .",
    "assuming that this spin up of the neutron star from its quiescence stage is a result of a continuous accretion of matter onto the stellar surface of the neutron star , we can estimate the accretion rate and the magnetic field of the neutron star .",
    "chandra _ observation in 2003 detected an x - ray luminosity of @xmath63 in the 0.5 - 10  kev energy bands . assuming the x - ray emission is from the accretion onto the stellar surface , the accretion rate at the surface is estimated as @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the bolometric correction , @xmath54 and @xmath66 are stellar radius of and the mass of the neutron star , respectively . in addition",
    ", @xmath67 is the x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the stellar radius of the neutron star in units of @xmath70  cm and @xmath71 is the mass of the neutron star in units of the solar mass .",
    "we assume that the accretion rate is constant in the quiescent stage before the onset of the outburst in 2009 january . combining the estimated accretion rate @xmath72 with conservation of the angular momentum that @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the magnetospheric radius where the magnetic pressure is balanced with the pressure of the accretion disk , the strength of the magnetic field of the neutron star is given by @xmath75 where we used the momentum of inertia of @xmath76 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field can be estimated as @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79  cm .",
    "this value is also similar to those extremely magnetized neutron stars ( known as magnetar , @xcite ) if the bolometric correction is @xmath80 . on the other hand , a typical strength of the magnetic field of a young neutron star @xmath81",
    "is expected if @xmath82 .",
    "accretion onto the neutron star surface is permitted when the magnetospheric radius @xmath74 becomes smaller than the corotation radius , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the period of the neutron star .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath85 .",
    "it will be expected that the outburst occurs as a result of the interaction between the equatorial disk of the be star and the neutron star at the periastron passage . near the periastron ,",
    "the velocity of the neutron star , @xmath86 , will become @xmath87 , where we used stellar mass and radius of be star of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this implies that the velocity of the neutron star is in general larger than the typical velocity for the matter of the equatorial disk of the be star , whose typical initial velocity is @xmath90  km / s @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the neutron star dominates that of the matter of the equatorial disk of the be star near the periastron .",
    "then the capture of the matter from the equatorial disk of the be star by the neutron star will occur at a radius of @xmath91 from the neutron star , where @xmath92 is the velocity of the material of the equatorial disk relative to the neutron star .    at the outburst stage in january of 2009 ,",
    "the average x - ray emission at 0.510  kev was measured with a luminosity of @xmath93 , indicating that the accretion rate onto the neutron star is @xmath94 this accretion rate for a young neutron star is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than typical mass loss rate ( @xmath95 ; @xcite ) of an equatorial disk around a be star .",
    "we can also estimate the accreting density of the surrounding medium from bondi accretion ( @xmath96 ; where @xmath97 is the ambient density ) .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath98 this is several orders smaller than the typical value ( @xmath99 ) of the density at the inner region of the disk @xcite , implying that ( 1 ) the neutron star is likely interacting with the outer edge of the be star disk or ( 2 ) the disk of be star in 1a  1118615 is relatively thin .",
    "our spectral analyses show one thermal polar cap component during the outburst stage in january and show an additional thermal disk component after the flaring in march .",
    "this might be explained as a result of the neutron star approaching the equatorial disk of the be star .",
    "when the neutron star first approached the equatorial disk , the accretion disk of the neutron star could have accumulated relatively little material , so the accretion disk would not have significant emission and we could only detect the polar cap emission of the neutron star .",
    "the flare of february might be caused by disk instabilities of the accretion disk of the neutron star .",
    "this indicates that the neutron star would have accreted significant amount of material from the equatorial disk of the be star during the periastron ; this makes the thermal disk component visible in the march observations after the february flare .",

    "on the other hand , the time interval of @xmath52  month between the detection of the outburst and the flaring in 2009 might also give another indication of the orbital period ; especially given the fact that the new be / xbp ( e.g. sax  j2103.5 + 4545 ; @xcite ) was discovered to have a rapid orbital motion with a long spin period .",

    "the soft thermal excess shows a lower temperature of @xmath100  kev and a larger emitting radius of @xmath101  km ; this component might be connected to the emission from the inner accretion disk of the binary system . in",
    "contrary to other xbps , we do not find a significant non - thermal component in the spectrum of 1a 1118615 .",
    "our results show that the thermal radiation from the hot spot of neutron star and from the reprocessing of the dense material in the inner disk provides the emission mechanism for 1a 1118615 after the outburst .",

    "<S> we report results of _ swift _ observations for the high mass be / x - ray binary system 1a 1118615 , during an outburst stage in january , 2009 and at a flaring stage in march , 2009 . using the epoch - folding method , we successfully detected a pulsed period of 407.69(2 ) sec in the outburst of january and of 407.26(1 ) sec after the flare detection in march . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectral detection for the source during outburst can be described by a blackbody model with a high temperature ( @xmath0  kev ) and a small radius ( @xmath1  km ) , indicating that the emission results from the polar cap of the neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the spectra obtained after the outburst can further be described by adding an additional component with a lower temperature ( @xmath2  kev ) and a larger emission radius ( @xmath3  km ) , which indicates the emission from around the inner region of an accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the thermal emission from the hot spot of the accreting neutron star dominates the radiation in outburst ; the existence of both this x - ray contribution and the additional soft component suggest that the polar cap and the accretion disk emission might co - exist after the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> because the two - blackbody signature at the flaring stage is a unique feature of 1a 1118615 , our spectral results may provide a new insight to interpret the x - ray emission for the accreting neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the time separation between the three main outbursts of this system is @xmath4  years and it might be related to the orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> we derive and discuss the associated physical properties by assuming the elongated orbit for this specific be / x - ray transient .    </S>",
