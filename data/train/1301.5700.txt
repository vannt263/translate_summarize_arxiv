    "the bohm criterion , as originally derived  @xcite , provides a condition that the ion flow speed must satisfy as ions leave a quasineutral plasma and enter a nonneutral sheath .",
    "bohm s derivation assumed a single species of monoenergetic ions with velocity @xmath2 and boltzmann electrons with temperature @xmath3 . from these assumptions , he showed that ions must be supersonic as they leave the plasma : @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it has since been shown theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite that equality typically holds in the bohm criterion .",
    "although the assumptions that bohm made in his seminal work often provide an accurate approximation of physical systems , an important question to answer is : how does the bohm criterion change for more general electron and ion distribution functions ?",
    "attempts to answer this question have been the topic of several theory papers over the past fifty years @xcite .",
    "harrison and thompson put forth one of the first such generalizations of the bohm criterion  @xcite . like bohm",
    ", they assumed that the electron density obeys a boltzmann relation , but allowed for a general ion distribution , @xmath5 .",
    "they predicted that ions should obey the criterion @xmath6 , at the sheath edge .",
    "later work by riemann @xcite generalized the electron term as well and found the criterion @xmath7 equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) is commonly called the `` generalized bohm criterion '' or the `` kinetic bohm criterion . ''",
    "it is a frequently cited result that has been applied in both analytic and numerical models of laboratory  @xcite and fusion  @xcite plasmas .",
    "it is also discussed in a popular textbook  @xcite . in deriving equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) , the electric field of the sheath",
    "is taken to be aligned in the @xmath8 direction , and it is assumed that the only spatial gradients of the particle distribution functions are caused by this electric field .",
    "although it is frequently cited in the theoretical literature , equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) does not produce a meaningful criterion for many plasmas of interest . if the ion distribution function has any particles with zero velocity , the left side of equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) diverges .",
    "if the velocity gradient of the electron distribution does not vanish at @xmath9 , the right side of equation ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) diverges . consider the common example where the ion distribution function is a flow - shifted maxwellian and the electron distribution is a stationary maxwellian . in this case",
    ", the left side of equation ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) is infinite and the right side is @xmath10 , which produces an unphysical prediction . equation ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) places undue importance on the part of the distribution functions where particles are slow .",
    "these shortcomings of equation ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) have been pointed out before . shortly after the publication of harrison and thompson s",
    "result , hall discussed the fact that unphysical divergences arise when the ion distribution contains slow particles @xcite .",
    "lieberman and lichtenberg @xcite mentioned that equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) can lead to `` mathematical difficulties '' at low energies .",
    "however , despite the fact that it often gives unphysical results and that this shortcoming has been discussed in previous publications , equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) continues to be used in plasma physics literature .",
    "experimental and numerical studies of presheath physics have been published that appear to contradict equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) .",
    "laser induced fluorescence has been used to measure the ion distribution function in the presheath of laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "these experiments found a maxwellian ion distribution with a flow speed approaching the sound speed at the sheath edge ; thus , @xmath11 .",
    "numerical simulations by sheridan  @xcite , meige  @xcite and robertson  @xcite also find ion distribution functions with populations of low energy ions throughout the presheath . these used hybrid ( fluid electron , kinetic ion ) and fully kinetic particle - in - cell techniques .",
    "consistent with the experiments , these simulations find that the ion flow speed approaches the sound speed at the sheath edge .",
    "these studies apparently contradict the implication of equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) that the low energy part of the ion distribution function dominates the ion dynamics at the sheath edge .    in section  [ sec : previous ] , we reconsider previous derivations of equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) .",
    "we show that these derivations contain two errors .",
    "the first of these is taking the @xmath12 moment of the collisionless kinetic equation ( i.e. vlasov equation ) . neglecting",
    "the collision operator is a mistake because the @xmath12 moment of it diverges if the distribution functions contain particles near zero velocity .",
    "not all distribution functions of interest satisfy the vlasov equation . only velocity moments with a positive power should be applied , otherwise divergences can arise in the integrand at @xmath9 for non - vlasov solutions .",
    "the second error is a mathematical mistake where integration by parts is misapplied to a function that is not continuously differentiable .",
    "this error can easily be corrected , but the resultant criterion then differs from equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) .    in section  [ sec : newbohm ] , we derive an alternative kinetic bohm criterion that is based upon positive exponent velocity moments of the kinetic equation , rather than the @xmath12 moment of previous work .",
    "this approach avoids the possibility of divergent velocity - space integrals .",
    "particles with low energy do not have any special significance in this theory .",
    "it also supports previous derivations of the bohm criterion based on fluid equations , and it returns these results in the fluid limit .",
    "in contrast , equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) can not return fluid results because it places undue importance on low energy particles .",
    "in section  [ sec : examples ] , we consider some example distribution functions that are common in low temperature plasmas , but for which the generalized bohm criterion we derive in section  [ sec : newbohm ] can give significantly different predictions than equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) .",
    "we consider example presheath models with a cold ionization source ( the tonks - langmuir problem ) , a warm ionization source as well as a collisional example where ions and electrons are maxwellian . in section [ sec",
    ": collisions ] , we discuss how electron - electron and ion - ion collisions in the presheath are often important in order to determine the distribution functions near the boundaries of laboratory plasmas . specifically , we show how ion - acoustic instabilities can significantly enhance these collisions and drive the distribution functions toward maxwellians .",
    "to derive equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) , one must first develop a mathematical definition of where the quasineutral plasma ( presheath ) ends and the nonneutral sheath begins .",
    "if the debye length is shorter than the ion momentum transfer collision length ( @xmath13 ) , the presheath and sheath are separated by a transition region  @xcite .",
    "this transition region scales as @xmath14  @xcite , which is typically much shorter than the presheath length scale ( @xmath15 ) . in the asymptotic limit @xmath16 ,",
    "the transition region is so short that the boundary layer problem can effectively be split into the two regions of quasineutral plasma ( presheath and bulk plasma ) and nonneutral sheath @xcite .",
    "the sharp boundary that results in this limit is what is typically referred to as the `` sheath edge . ''",
    "the sheath criterion is a condition that the spatial gradient of the charge density must satisfy at the sheath edge .",
    "riemann derives the sheath criterion by applying to poisson s equation the physical requirement that quasineutrality breaks down at the sheath edge  @xcite .",
    "his derivation can be summarized as follows .",
    "expanding poisson s equation about the sheath edge , where the electrostatic potential is referenced to zero @xmath17 , yields @xmath18 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath19 is the charge density .",
    "it is assumed that the electrostatic potential variation of the presheath and sheath is one - dimensional and we align this in the @xmath8 direction . at the sheath edge , which is the boundary of quasineutral plasma , the first nonvanishing term in this expansion is the linear term : @xmath20 .",
    "multiplying this by @xmath21 and integrating with respect to @xmath22 yields @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "since @xmath25 as @xmath26 on the sheath length scale , the constant @xmath24 must be zero @xcite .",
    "we are then left with @xmath27 , which implies the sheath criterion @xmath28 the sheath criterion provides a mathematical definition of the sheath edge .",
    "using the fact that @xmath29 , the sheath criterion can also be written @xmath30 .",
    "since the relation between density and the distribution function is simply @xmath31 , equation  ( [ eq : sheathcrit1 ] ) becomes @xmath32      equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) has been derived using various approaches by different authors @xcite , but each approach contains the following elements .",
    "these are collisionless theories based on the one - dimensional steady - state vlasov equation @xmath33 where it is assumed that the only spatial gradients of @xmath34 are due to the electric field in the presheath and sheath .",
    "each approach ( at some point in the derivation ) also divides equation  ( [ eq:1dvlasov ] ) by @xmath35 , to obtain an expression for @xmath36 , which can be put into the sheath criterion of equation  ( [ eq : sheathcrit ] ) . in other words , the @xmath12 moment of the vlasov equation",
    "is used . applying this approach yields the following form of a kinetic bohm criterion @xmath37 assuming that the plasma consists of a single species of ions with charge @xmath38 and electrons , this is @xmath39    one additional step",
    "is required in order to write equation  ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) in the form of equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) .",
    "this is to integrate the @xmath35 component of the ion term by parts , @xmath40 where the surface term ( the first on the right side ) is taken to vanish since @xmath41_{v_z = \\pm \\infty}=0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "applying equation  ( [ eq : intbyparts ] ) to the left side of equation  ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) completes this simple derivation of the conventional kinetic bohm criterion from equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) .",
    "two mistakes are made in all derivations of the conventional kinetic bohm criterion , including the one presented in section  [ sec : ckbc ] .",
    "they are :    1 .",
    "the collision operator should not be neglected if one is to take the @xmath12 moment of the kinetic equation .",
    "this is because @xmath42 diverges unless the collision operator vanishes .",
    "however , the collision operator only vanishes when the plasma is in equilibrium , which implies that both ions and electrons have maxwellian distributions with the same temperature and flow speed @xcite .",
    "this would lead to a contradiction in equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) because it reduces to @xmath43 for maxwellian distributions .",
    "since the function @xmath44 is not generally continuously differentiable , the integration by parts conducted in equation  ( [ eq : intbyparts ] ) is invalid .",
    "this deficiency has also been pointed out before  @xcite .",
    "the easier of these two issues to correct is ( ii ) since the integration by parts step can simply be avoided and the kinetic bohm criterion left in the form of equation  ( [ eq : kbohmspec ] ) or ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) .",
    "however , even these equations are incorrect because of issue ( i ) , which will be discussed below . that the integration by parts step of equation  ( [ eq : intbyparts ] ) is incorrect can be shown from a simple example .",
    "the contentious step is of the form @xmath45 for any physically possible distribution function ( e.g. , the restrictions @xmath46 and that @xmath47 is positive for all @xmath48 can be imposed since any physical distribution must obey these ) . if one takes as an example @xmath49 , the left side of equation  ( [ eq : ibpex ] ) can be evaluated directly @xmath50 however , if the surface term on the right side of equation  ( [ eq : ibpex ] ) is taken to be zero , as it is in derivations of the conventional kinetic bohm criterion , the right side of equation  ( [ eq : ibpex ] ) diverges @xmath51 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & -2 \\sqrt{\\pi } + \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{2}{|\\epsilon | } e^{-|\\epsilon |^2 } \\rightarrow \\infty    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reason that integration by parts can not be applied in equation  ( [ eq : intbyparts ] ) is that it is only valid for continuously differentiable functions @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath52 is not continuous unless @xmath53 , and @xmath52 is not continuously differentiable unless both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are continuous .",
    "many physically reasonable , often expected , plasma distribution functions do not satisfy these properties .",
    "thus , issue ( ii ) restricts the previous kinetic bohm criteria to the form of equation  ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) .",
    "however , issue ( i ) will show that there is a problem with equation  ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) as well .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) also places undue importance on the low - velocity part of the distribution functions .",
    "the primary deficiency of the collisionless vlasov approach is simply that the collision operator can not be neglected if one is interested in @xmath12 moments of the kinetic equation . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider what happens if the approach of section  [ sec : ckbc ] is taken but the collision operator is not neglected .",
    "then , the relevant kinetic equation has the form @xmath56 in which @xmath57 is the total collision operator .",
    "the total collision operator consists of the sum of component collision operators describing collisions between the test species @xmath58 with all species in the plasma ( @xmath59 ) including itself ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the component collision operators have the landau form  @xcite @xmath61 in which @xmath62 is a tensor kernel .",
    "lenard @xcite and balescu @xcite have shown that in a stable plasma @xmath63 where @xmath64}{\\bigr| \\hat{\\varepsilon}({\\mathbf}{k } , { \\mathbf}{k } \\cdot { \\mathbf}{v } ) \\bigl|^2 }   .",
    "\\label{eq : qlb}\\ ] ] here @xmath65 is the plasma dielectric function for electrostatic fluctuations in an unmagnetized plasma .",
    "taking the @xmath12 moment of equation  ( [ eq : pke ] ) , in order to find an equation for @xmath36 , and putting the result into equation  ( [ eq : sheathcrit ] ) gives the criterion @xmath66 which can be compared to the vlasov result from equation  ( [ eq : kbohmspec ] ) .",
    "a brief study of equation  ( [ eq : kbohmwithc ] ) shows that not only the left side , but also the right side , which depends on the @xmath12 moment of the collision operator , diverges if @xmath67 or @xmath68 for any species @xmath58 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : kbohmwithc ] ) shows that neglecting the collision operator is not a consistent approximation when the @xmath12 moment is applied .",
    "for example , consider a plasma with a stationary maxwellian electron species and a maxwellian ion species flowing relative to the electrons . in this case @xmath69 and @xmath70 , but @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 , the @xmath73 term will cause the right side of equation  ( [ eq : kbohmwithc ] ) to diverge .",
    "the ion term on the left side of equation  ( [ eq : kbohmwithc ] ) diverges for this example as well .",
    "the only case for which the vlasov approach , and thus equation  ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) , is strictly correct is for maxwellian ions and electrons with the same temperature and flow speeds : in this limit @xmath74 . for this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : kbohmint ] ) [ or equivalently equation  ( [ eq : kbohmwithc ] ) ] reduces to @xmath75 , which is a true statement , but is not useful as a bohm criterion .",
    "the presence of an ionization source in the vlasov equation can produce additional problems for the conventional kinetic bohm criterion . including the effects of a source @xmath76 in the above analysis",
    ", one finds an equivalent divergent contribution to the right side of equation  ( [ eq : kbohmwithc ] ) unless @xmath77 .",
    "section  [ sec : colesions ] discusses the implication for the bohm criterion of various ionization source functions that have been considered in previous literature . in some of these examples , such as a maxwellian source function ,",
    "the resultant ion distribution function contains slow particles causing the conventional kinetic bohm criterion to diverge .",
    "by taking positive velocity moments ( e.g. , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) of the full kinetic equation , a formally exact set of fluid equations are derived .",
    "however , this approach suffers from the `` closure '' problem where evolution equations for low order moments are determined by higher order moments . because of this accounting difficulty",
    ", the fluid equations are not closed unless further approximations are made . in the limit",
    "that the distribution function is a flow shifted maxwellian , the plasma is completely described by the lowest order moments @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , which determine the evolution of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "a hierarchy of fluid moment equations can be constructed from velocity moments of the plasma kinetic equation for species @xmath58 @xmath87 by applying the standard definitions of the fluid variables in terms of velocity - space integrals of the distribution function .",
    "these are density @xmath88 fluid flow velocity @xmath89 scalar pressure @xmath90 stress tensor @xmath91 temperature @xmath92 and frictional force density @xmath93 here we have defined the relative velocity @xmath94 , where @xmath85 is the fluid flow velocity from equation  ( [ eq : fluidflow ] ) .",
    "the density moment @xmath95 of the kinetic equation  ( [ eq : kineticeq ] ) yields the continuity equation @xmath96 the momentum moment @xmath97 yields the momentum evolution equation @xmath98 equations  ( [ eq : cont ] ) , ( [ eq : momentum ] ) and subsequent equations built from higher exponent velocity moments of the kinetic equation constitute a hierarchy of fluid equations . in the next section ,",
    "we use equations  ( [ eq : cont ] ) and ( [ eq : momentum ] ) to formulate a bohm criterion that can be written in terms of the distribution functions by associating the fluid variables with their definitions in terms of @xmath34 from equations  ( [ eq : density ] )  ( [ eq : fric1 ] ) . in this way the resultant criterion retains a kinetic form .",
    "bohm s original criterion ( @xmath99 ) was a condition concerning the ion speed ( assumed to be monoenergetic in his paper ) at the sheath edge .",
    "kinetic bohm criteria seek to generalize this condition to account for arbitrary ion and electron distribution functions .",
    "however , it is unclear exactly what qualifies as a `` kinetic bohm criterion . '' for instance , the sheath criterion of equation  ( [ eq : sheathcrit ] ) specifies a condition that the spatial gradients of the distribution functions must satisfy at the sheath edge , yet it is not typically called a `` bohm criterion . '' a possible definition for `` bohm criteria '' might be statements concerning the ion flow speed at the sheath edge .",
    "although it is not obvious that the conventional kinetic bohm criterion of equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) always fits this definition , we will look specifically for a condition concerning the fluid flow velocity of ions [ defined in terms of equation  ( [ eq : fluidflow ] ) ] at the sheath edge .",
    "we assume that the plasma is in steady - state and that the only spatial variation in @xmath34 is due to the electric field in the sheath and presheath .",

    "it makes no assumptions about the distribution functions and can be written explicitly in terms of them by substituting the fluid variables with their definitions from equations  ( [ eq : density ] )  ( [ eq : fric1 ] ) .",
    "it does depend on spatial gradients of the higher - order moments temperature and stress tensor and the collisional friction .",
    "these could be eliminated in terms of spatial gradients of even higher order fluid moments , the heat flux in this case , by using the temperature evolution equation [ obtained from the @xmath113 moment of the kinetic equation ] .",
    "however , no matter how far one carries out the hierarchy expansion , the subsequent bohm criterion will still depend on a spatial derivative of @xmath34 inside of some fluid moment integral .",
    "various closure schemes can be applied to deal with these higher - order moments  @xcite .    in many plasmas , but not all ( see e.g. section  [ sec : trun ] ) , the temperature and stress moments vary on spatial scales much longer than the debye length . for instance , the gradient length scales for the temperature and stress terms are often characteristic of the length scale for collisions between species @xmath58 and the background neutrals or another species ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "these lengths are typically on the order of the presheath length scale ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : longbohmcrit ] ) can be simplified significantly for such plasmas because the terms in parentheses become negligible .",
    "the friction term is also controlled by collisions and acts over a collision length scale ( including friction with neutrals  @xcite ) .",

    "it was also shown that the ion term of equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) is based on a misapplication of integration - by - parts if a general ion distribution function is to be allowed .",
    "an alternative kinetic bohm criterion based upon positive - exponent velocity moments of the plasma kinetic equation was derived in section  [ sec : newbohm ] .",
    "the result is similar to conventional fluid theories , but where the fluid variables are defined in terms of positive - exponent velocity moments of the distribution functions .",
    "developing the theory in this manner avoids the possibility of divergent integrals .",
    "in contrast to the conventional kinetic bohm criterion , slow ions and electrons have no particular significance in this new kinetic formulation of the bohm criterion .",
    "this model was compared with equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) for several example distribution functions that are common in various laboratory plasmas .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) contained divergent integrals for some of these examples , while the new theory provided the condition that the ion flow speed be supersonic at the sheath edge .    in section  [ sec : collisions ] , we considered the role of coulomb collisions in determining the ion distribution function in the presheath .",
    "typically ions are assumed to be either collisionless or to collide only with neutrals in the presheath because the ion - ion collision length in a stable plasma is usually much longer than the presheath length near the sheath edge .",
    "however , the presheath of plasmas in which @xmath239 can be unstable to ion - acoustic instabilities .",
    "section  [ sec : collisions ] shows that these ion - acoustic instabilities shorten the ion - ion collision length to such a degree that ions can be considered collisional ( to ion - ion collisions ) near the presheath - sheath boundary and through the sheath .",
    "when this happens , the ions have a flowing maxwellian distribution function at the sheath edge .",
    "a flowing maxwellian distribution is one example where the conventional kinetic bohm criterion of equation  ( [ eq : kbohm ] ) diverges .",
    "the kinetic bohm criterion of section  [ sec : newbohm ] simply reduces to the fluid - like result of a supersonic ion flow speed for this case .",
