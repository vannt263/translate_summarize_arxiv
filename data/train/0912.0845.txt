    "in the ` standard ' model of long - duration , soft - spectrum gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. @xcite ) , the prompt high - energy emission arises in ultra - relativistic ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 ) , highly collimated ( opening half - angle of a few degrees ) jets .",
    "the high lorentz factors are inferred from the requirement of a sufficiently low opacity to photon - photon annihilation or to scattering by photon annihilation - produced electron - positron pairs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the high collimation makes it possible to reduce the total flow energy down to values that are comparable to the energy of stellar explosions .         as the jets make their way through the interstellar medium they sweep the ambient gas into a thin relativistic shell that itself becomes a strong source of electromagnetic radiation . after a sufficiently large amount of gas",
    "is swept up , the shell begins to decelerate .",
    "simplified models of this interaction predict that a panchromatic break would then occur in the afterglow light curve , provided that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the jet opening half - angle .",
    "the detection of such ` jet breaks ' on time scales of @xmath5 day in several ( primarily long / soft ) grb afterglows has been a key reason for the widespread adoption of the jet model for these sources .",
    "the observed break parameters have made it possible to deduce the opening half - angle of these jets .",
    "the inferred values are strongly model dependent , although they usually lie the range of @xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although more recent observations by the _ swift _ satellite have revealed that late - time panchromatic jet breaks are not that common and that various aspects of the jet model may need to be modified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these breaks remain the strongest evidence for collimated outflows in grb sources .",
    "the supernova connection of long / soft grbs provides strong support for theoretical models of their jet engines that invoke dying massive and rapidly rotating stars .",
    "these models are generally divided into two groups depending on the mechanism of jet acceleration . in the first group",
    "the acceleration is driven by the thermodynamic pressure of plasma heated to ultra - relativistic temperatures via the annihilation of neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted by the accretion disk formed around the central black hole , thus tapping the disk thermal energy . in the second group",
    "the acceleration is driven by magnetic stresses , tapping the rotational energy of the disk or the central compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) . at present , both the magnetic and",
    "the thermal mechanisms seem possible , although the lack of detection of a thermal component in the spectra of some grbs is consistent with the notion that , at least in certain cases , the outflow is initially magnetically dominated @xcite .    the magnetic jet acceleration mechanism has been the subject of theoretical study for many years . due to the mathematical complexity of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) ,",
    "which is even more pronounced in the relativistic limit , it has been possible to find analytical and semi - analytical solutions only for a rather limited number of problems characterized by a high degree of symmetry .",
    "in fact , there is only one available _",
    "exact _ solution of the relativistic mhd equations including thermal and magnetic effects , the self - similar model of @xcite .",
    "the advance of numerical methods for relativistic mhd during the last decade has opened a new direction of study that has already resulted in significant progress ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in particular , @xcite investigated the magnetic acceleration of ultra - relativistic flows within channels of prescribed geometry , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are dimensionless cylindrical coordinates ) , determined by the shape of coordinate surfaces of elliptical coordinates .",
    "such shapes correspond to power - law distributions of the confining pressure that can approximate the expected distributions in the envelopes of the progenitor stars in both the collapsar and the magnetar scenarios ( which correspond to the dying star leaving behind a black hole or a neutron star , respectively ) as well as the effect of a confining disk wind . among other results",
    ", they found that in the case of a gradually widening channel , @xmath10 , the acceleration is not efficient , whereas in the case of a channel with gradually increasing collimation , @xmath11 , the acceleration is effective but the asymptotic flow obeys the inequality @xmath12 .",
    "these numerical results have been strengthened by complementary theoretical analyses @xcite , which led to the question of whether the magnetic models can accommodate the jet breaks at all .",
    "recently , a similar numerical study was carried out by @xcite , who confirmed the findings of @xcite .",
    "they have , however , also considered a somewhat modified setup , wherein at some distance from the origin , roughly corresponding to the stellar surface , the channel geometry changes from progressively collimating to progressively de - collimating .",
    "in this setup @xcite observed a remarkable change in the jet behaviour : beyond the point where the geometry changed , the jet speed underwent a strong boost that was accompanied only by a very small increase in the jet opening angle . as a result ,",
    "the asymptotic flow had @xmath13 , which made it possible for late - time jet breaks to occur .",
    "the exact shape of the channel above the transition point did not seem to matter .    in this paper",
    "we describe ( section  [ simulations ] ) simulations that confirm the results of @xcite and then analyse ( section  [ interpretation ] ) the underlying physical mechanism . we discuss and summarize our results in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the numerical method is exactly the same as in @xcite and we refer the reader interested in technical details to that paper . here",
    "we only remark that our numerical code is based on the godunov - type scheme for relativistic mhd @xcite and that we look for steady - state axisymmetric solutions using time - dependent simulations with time - independent boundary conditions .    for our purpose we selected model b1 from @xcite ,",
    "for which the channel shape parameter is @xmath14 .",
    "this model describes a cold flow with values of the field - line constant @xmath15 , defined as the energy flux per unit rest - mass energy flux , as large as @xmath16 .",
    "this constant sets the upper limit on the lorentz factor that can be achieved in this model via ideal mhd mechanism .. ] the initial ratio of the poynting flux to the hydrodynamic energy flux is @xmath17 , as the initial lorentz factor , @xmath18 , is close to unity , corresponding to a sub - alfvnic flow .",
    "the base rotation is uniform , with the dimensionless light - cylinder radius @xmath19 being @xmath20 ; we used the distance of the inlet boundary from the origin as the unit of length .    to examine the effect of changing the channel shape , we map the solution at @xmath21 and @xmath22 onto the inlet boundary of a new grid corresponding to a conical channel of the same local radius and with a vertex located at the origin . in this way",
    "we introduce a change in the channel shape to a profile that results in less collimation .",
    "we then proceed with the simulations on the new grid , following the same procedure as in model b1 .",
    "the two solutions obtained in this way , which we denote as b1a and b1b , are analysed below .",
    "[ lorentz ] shows the overall geometry as well as the shape of the magnetic surfaces and the evolution of the lorentz factor in models b1 and b1b .",
    "one can see that , in contrast with the situation in model b1 , the field lines in model b1b straighten out .",
    "one might think that this reflects the conical shape of the channel , but this is not so .",
    "in fact , the jet is separated from the channel wall by a near vacuum .",
    "this is the reason why the red - coloured boundary layer in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ lorentz ] is free from magnetic field lines .",
    "a similar separation has been seen in model e of @xcite and , we believe , also in the simulations of @xcite . as a result , the wall and the jet are causally disconnected and the precise shape of the wall does not matter .    in model",
    "b1b the jet lorentz factor approaches its maximum possible value @xmath23 at the jet boundary , signalling a total conversion of the poynting flux . the acceleration is weaker in the jet interior but , as one can clearly see in fig .",
    "[ lorentz ] , it is still more effective than in model b1 .",
    "this is further illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ sigma ] , which compares the acceleration in both models along the magnetic surface enclosing @xmath24 of the jet s total poloidal magnetic flux . in the case of model b1a , where the channel opens up much earlier",
    ", the jet also passes through a phase of rapid acceleration .",
    "however , the acceleration slows down dramatically when the jet enters the phase of ballistic expansion . as a result ,",
    "the final lorentz factor in this model is even lower than in model b1 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ lorentz ] , the opening angle of the jet does not change much after passing the point where the channel widens , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , the product @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the local opening half - angle , is expected to increase following the rapid increase of the lorentz factor .",
    "this is indeed the case , as one can see in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ sigma ] . in model",
    "b1b this product is much larger than in model b1 , approaching values that are @xmath1 near the jet boundary . concluding this section , we reiterate that our results are in very good agreement with those obtained in @xcite , thus confirming that the effect is real and must have a robust physical basis .",
    "once the jet separates from the wall in models b1a and b1b it enters the phase of free expansion and eventually becomes a ballistic conical outflow with radial streamlines . during the transition from the one regime to the other a strong fast - magnetosonic rarefaction wave propagates into the jet . since at this point the jet is causally connected ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the wave is not confined to a boundary layer but propagates all the way to the jet core .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ pressure ] , which compares the distributions of the magnetic pressure @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the magnetic field amplitude in the comoving frame ) in models b1 and b1b downstream from the channel - widening point .",
    "the observed jet acceleration is apparently related to the properties of this wave .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon has already been seen in other numerical simulations of both purely hydrodynamic and magnetized flows @xcite . here",
    "we elucidate its physical nature by considering a simpler one - dimensional problem of relativistic expansion into vacuum in a slab geometry .",
    "the rarefaction wave in this case is described by a self - similar solution known as a ` simple wave ' .",
    "although such a flow is not identical to the one in our simulated jets , it nevertheless captures the underlying physical mechanism .",
    "consider a quasilinear hyperbolic system @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a vector of dependent variables , e.g. the gas pressure , density , etc .",
    ", and @xmath31 is an @xmath32 matrix .",
    "when the initial ( @xmath33 ) configuration describes two uniform states separated by a discontiniuty at @xmath34 ( a riemann problem ) , the system allows self - similar solutions that depend only on @xmath35 . in general , the solution involves a combination of shock and rarefaction waves , but in the case of expansion into vacuum it describes a single rarefaction wave ( a simple wave ) . in terms of the new independent variable @xmath36 , the system of equations  ( [ h - system ] ) reduces to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unit matrix .",
    "this equation has the form of the characteristic equation for the matrix @xmath39 , and thus @xmath36 is equal to one of the eigenvalues of @xmath39 , @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the corresponding right eigenvector .",
    "each eigenvalue represent the phase speed of a particular wave , whereas the right eigenvector determines the connection between the variations of the dependent variables that are induced by the wave .",
    "equation  ( [ sw - eq ] ) can be conveniently written as @xmath42 integrating this system , one finds @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , and then equation  ( [ eq - of - char ] ) ( the equation of characteristics ) can be used to obtain @xmath45 .",
    "the systems of equations for relativistic hydrodynamics and for relativistic mhd can be written in the form of equation  ( [ h - system ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for all hyperbolic waves can be found , for example , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "simple waves have been analysed in @xcite for purely hydrodynamic flows and in @xcite for magnetized flows in which the magnetic field is tangential to the discontinuity and orthogonal to the flow velocity .",
    "consider a simple one - dimensional problem with plane geometry describing the evolution of an initial discontinuity that separates a uniform magnetized cold plasma at rest on the left and vacuum on the right .",
    "this problem is related to the transverse expansion of our simulated jets after they lose external support , as seen in the jet comoving frame .",
    "the discontinuity decays into a single wave , namely the simple fast - magnetosonic rarefaction wave .",
    "the left front of this wave ( the head ) propagates into the left state with the local fast - magnetosonic speed and the right front ( the tail ) moves into vacuum with some finite terminal speed .",
    "in such a simple geometry , the lorentz force only involves the magnetic pressure , and the equations of mhd reduce to those of hydrodynamics of an ideal gas with a polytropic index @xmath46 . in this case",
    "the effective sound speed @xmath47 is equal to the fast - magnetosonic speed , which satisfies @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the rest - mass density and @xmath50 is the local magnetization parameter .",
    "this property allows us to utilize the results obtained for the corresponding problem in relativistic gas dynamics .",
    "in particular , the integration of equation  ( [ sw - eq1 ] ) yields the integral across the rarefaction @xmath51 @xcite , where @xmath52 is the local flow speed . this equation can be used to deduce @xmath53 , the wave s expansion speed into vacuum . specifically , by equating the value of the above invariant as derived from the given left state to the value obtained at the boundary with the vacuum ( where @xmath54 ) , one finds @xmath55 @xmath56 for example , if in the left state , where @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 , and hence @xmath59 , then the lorentz factor of expansion into vacuum is @xmath60 .",
    "next , consider another reference frame that moves along the initial discontinuity with a lorentz factor @xmath61  this corresponds to the jet source frame in our simulations .",
    "the lorentz factor of plasma at the right front of the rarefaction wave in this frame is @xmath62 which in our example is three times larger than @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the seemingly weak acceleration in the jet frame may correspond to a huge boost in the jet source frame : in our example the lorentz factor increases from @xmath63 to the left of the rarefaction wave to @xmath64 at the boundary with vacuum .",
    "this is the essence of the acceleration mechanism that operates in the free expansion regime of the jet simulations .",
    "however , the jet expansion problem can not be completely reduced to the one considered here since it is inherently two dimensional ( see section  [ bunching ] and appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "the results can therefore be expected to be _ quantitatively _ different , as one can readily verify .",
    "indeed , along a magnetic surface of a steady jet the energy flux per unit rest mass flux is conserved , which for a cold flow leads to the integral @xmath65 where @xmath66 and where @xmath61 and @xmath67 represent the initial jet lorentz factor and magnetization , respectively .",
    "thus , the lorentz factor at the tail of the rarefaction wave , where the magnetization has decreased to zero , has to be @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , equations  ( [ exp_gamma ] ) and  ( [ lor ] ) imply that @xmath69 , where @xmath67 is the magnetization of the undisturbed left state of the riemann problem ( which we identify with the initial magnetization in the steady - jet problem ) .      here",
    "we consider a more complicated riemann problem where the velocity of the left state is not zero but has a component tangent to the discontinuity , @xmath70 .",
    "this corresponds to the jet expansion as seen in the jet source frame .",
    "the magnetic field of the left state is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 corresponds to the jet azimuthal magnetic field as measured in the comoving frame .",
    "in addition , we no longer assume that the left state is cold , which will allow us to compare the purely hydrodynamic and mhd cases .",
    "in the rarefaction wave @xmath73 and @xmath74 . this case has been analysed in @xcite .",

    "this is indeed the behaviour seen in our jet simulations .",
    "the rarefaction acceleration process has been seen in numerical simulations of both unmagnetized and magnetized flows and a number of conclusions have been drawn about the role of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "as both cases may have applications in astrophysics , we are motivated to extend our analysis and investigate the role of the magnetic field in the rarefaction mechanism a bit further .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to see if the presence of strong magnetic fields can lead to some observationally identifiable features . to check on ths",
    "we have derived self - similar solutions of the riemann problem described in section  [ case2 ] for four different left states : a cold mhd flow , a hot mhd flow and two purely hydrodynamic ( hd ) flows with different values of @xmath61 . in all of these cases",
    "the magnitude of the energy flux per unit rest - mass energy flux @xmath95 is kept the same .",
    "the lorentz factor near the boundary with the vacuum approaches this value , independently of the other characteristics of the rarefaction wave ( see equation  [ boundary - g ] ) . however , the spatial distribution of the lorentz factor near the right boundary turns out to be quite sensitive to the magnetization of the left state .",
    "[ raref_gammacont ] shows the results of the numerical integrations for an ideal gas with polytropic index @xmath134 .",
    "if we compare the properties of the cold mhd flow ( first column ) with those of the hd flow ( third column ) we see that the acceleration is much stronger in the cold mhd case . in the first place this is due to the fact that , in the mhd case , the acceleration occurs over a larger volume of the jet .",
    "this is simply a reflection of the difference in the speeds of the rarefaction wave s head  in the hd case it is determined by the sound speed @xmath135 , whereas in the mhd case it is determined by the fast - magnetosonic speed @xmath83 , which can approach the speed of light .",
    "a second reason for the difference between the mhd and hd cases has to do with the dependence of the ( generalized ) specific enthalpy on the mass density .",
    "whereas @xmath136 is proportional to the mass density @xmath49 , @xmath137 is proportional to @xmath138 . as the density drops across the rarefaction wave , the magnetic energy declines much faster than the thermal energy , which explains the relative inefficiency of the hydrodynamic case .",
    "for example , in the hd flow shown in the third column of fig .",
    "[ raref_gammacont ] , the density is @xmath139 at @xmath140 , but the value of @xmath137 is still 2 ( meaning that the lorentz factor is only a half of its maximum value , @xmath141 ) .",
    "in contrast , in the cold mhd case @xmath136 is only @xmath142 at the same value of the density , meaning that @xmath133 is already @xmath143 .",
    "note that the time dependence of the density of a particular fluid parcel is different in the two cases . as shown in appendix  [ append_approx ] , in the mhd case",
    "the density drops with time as @xmath144 , whereas in the hd case it declines faster ( @xmath145 ) due to the higher speed of the tail of the rarefaction . nevertheless , the ( generalized ) specific enthalpy in the mhd and hd cases is proportional to @xmath144 and @xmath146 , respectively , implying that the increase of the lorentz factor is much stronger in the former case .",
    "the above interpretation of the rarefaction - acceleration mechanism is consistent with the general analysis of the acceleration of cold , steady - state jets presented in @xcite , where it was shown that the bulk flow acceleration is intimately related to the shape of the field ( or stream ) lines through the ` bunching function ' @xmath147 where @xmath8 is the cylindrical distance from the rotation axis , @xmath148 is the amplitude of the poloidal magnetic field and @xmath149 is the magnetic flux function . in the super  fast - magnetosonic regime the lorentz factor increases when @xmath150 decreases .",
    "specifically , one can show that @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the distance measured along the poloidal magnetic field lines and the effective rest - mass @xmath153 is constant on magnetic flux surfaces ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "the coefficient in front of the derivative on the left hand side of this equation vanishes at the fast - magnetosonic critical surface which , in the highly relativistic limit , implies @xmath154 .",
    "thus , in the super  fast - magnetosonic regime , acceleration corresponds to a decrease in @xmath150 , whereas in the sub  fast - magnetosonic regime it corresponds to an increase in the bunching function .",
    "this is analogous to the transonic hydrodynamic flow in a de laval nozzle , with @xmath155 playing the role of the nozzle cross section",
    ".    equation ( [ bf ] ) shows that , for @xmath150 to decrease , @xmath148 should decrease faster than @xmath156 , i.e. the separation between neighbouring magnetic flux surfaces should increase with distance faster than @xmath8 , their cylindrical radius . in confined flows , such as model b1 and the other cases studied in @xcite ,",
    "this is realised through the stronger collimation of the inner flux surfaces relative to the outer ones .",
    "for this reason , the acceleration mechanism at work in such flows can be dubbed the _",
    "collimation mechanism_.     and the amplitude of poloidal magnetic field decreases faster than @xmath156 .",
    ", width=302 ]    the acceleration mechanism that operates in models b1a and b1b during the transition to the ballistic regime is different from the collimation mechanism in that it involves a rarefaction wave , and we therefore dub it the _ rarefaction mechanism_. in this process , the rarefaction wave that is launched at the jet boundary at the point where the channel widens reaches the jet axis much further downstream .",
    "therefore , the outer field lines straighten much closer to the source than the inner ones ( see fig .  [ ill ] ) .",
    "the net effect is again that @xmath148 decreases faster than @xmath156 .",
    "inspection of models b1a and b1b shows that the magnetic bunching function indeed decreases along the magnetic field lines ( see fig .  [ s ] ) and that in both of these models the flow becomes super  fast - magnetosonic well upstream of the channel widening point .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm the discovery by @xcite of the additional fast acceleration of relativistic jets during the transition from a confined to an unconfined regime .",
    "we have analyzed the acceleration mechanism and concluded that it is related to the sideways expansion of the jet that is triggered by the elimination of support from the confining wall .",
    "this expansion does not lead to a significant increase of the jet opening angle because of the high mach number that the flow has already attained by the time it reaches the location where the channel opens up .",
    "the induced rarefaction wave is nevertheless strong enough to lead to the conversion of a large fraction of the remaining magnetic energy into kinetic energy of bulk motion .",
    "the rarefaction - acceleration mechanism and its potential relevance to relativistic astrophysical flows were previously considered by @xcite and @xcite for unmagnetized and magnetized flows , respectively . as discussed in section  [ hdvsmhdsection ] , the slow expansion of the left front of the rarefaction and the weak dependence of the enthalpy on the density in a hydrodynamic outflow ,",
    "as compared to the faster expansion and stronger dependence of the magnetic energy on the density in mhd cases , is evidently behind the finding of @xcite that this acceleration mechanism is more efficient in mhd outflows than in purely hydrodynamic ones .",
    "although this mechanism operates even in newtonian flows , its role there is not that important .",
    "this is because a high fast - magnetosonic mach number in the newtonian regime implies that most of the magnetic energy has already been converted into kinetic energy of bulk motion , so the effect of any additional acceleration is rather insignificant even if it involves a full conversion of the remaining magnetic energy .",
    "the situation is different in the relativistic case since the flow can remain magnetically dominated even in the highly super  fast - magnetosonic regime .",
    "note in this connection that the gradual increase of the lorentz factor of an unmagnetized long / soft grb outflow as it first emerges from underneath the surface of the associated progenitor star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has a different origin than the rarefaction acceleration considered here . in the unmagnetized case , a ` cocoon ' of moderately relativistic , shocked jet and stellar material that formed",
    "while the outflow was confined within the star is the first component to be revealed .",
    "the second component to emerge is the faster shocked jet material that occupies the region between the jet head and the reverse shock that was induced by the interaction of the outflow with the stellar envelope .",
    "finally , the unshocked , high - velocity jet itself comes out .",
    "the behaviour of the latter component after it leaves the star is initially influenced by the presence of the ` shielding ' cocoon gas .",
    "whether significant rarefaction acceleration could occur under these circumstances even in a jet that reaches the stellar surface with a measurable fraction of its thermal energy not yet converted into kinetic energy remains to be investigated .",
    "we have shown that when the rarefaction wave propagates inside the jet it produces a region where the separation between neighbouring poloidal magnetic surfaces increases faster than their cylindrical radius .",
    "this is a common feature of magnetic acceleration in the super  fast - magnetosonic regime and is also a characteristic of the magnetic acceleration process of externally confined flows by the collimation mechanism .",
    "however , there are also significant differences between these two mechanisms .",
    "most importantly , acceleration by the collimation mechanism can be sustained over many decades in distance and produces asymptotic flows with @xmath157 , whereas the rarefaction mechanism continues only for as long as it takes for the rarefaction wave to cross the jet ( of the order of the current jet length in our numerical models ) , and subsequently the flow enters a phase of ballistic expansion wherein the magnetic acceleration is so slow that it can be ignored .",
    "we emphasize that the present study has involved axisymmetric simulations . a fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) treatment is needed to address the issue of stability ,",
    "although we note that the results to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that magnetically accelerated relativistic jets basically remain stable as they propagate away from the source .",
    "it is also not yet entirely clear whether the acceleration / collimation properties of 3d outflows remain the same as in the axisymmetric case , but , at least on the basis of newtonian simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it appears that the acceleration efficiency remains roughly the same .",
    "the most effective magnetic acceleration of steady flows could be achieved via a combination of both mechanisms  first the collimation mechanism produces a flow with @xmath157 , and then the rarefaction mechanism provides additional acceleration , resulting in a particle - dominated ( @xmath158 ) flow .",
    "model b1b is an illustrative example of such a combination ( see fig .",
    "[ sigma ] ) , and it is interesting to examine whether it could in principle be realized in long / soft grb sources .",
    "if the jet originates from a rapidly rotating black hole then the light cylinder radius is of the order of a few gravitational radii , @xmath159 cm for a @xmath160 black hole .",
    "if the confining medium is the stellar envelope , the collimation mechanism operates up to @xmath161 .",
    "a quick inspection of fig .  [ sigma ] shows that this corresponds to the channel widening point in our model b1b .",
    "thus , it may indeed be possible to accelerate long / soft grb flows to the high lorentz factors indicated by observations , with @xmath162 decreasing to values @xmath163 ( as happens in this example on scales @xmath164 cm )",
    ". however , it seems unlikely that the low magnetization ( @xmath165 ) required for effective dissipation in the internal - shocks model for the prompt @xmath166-ray emission can be attained in this scenario , which suggests that magnetic energy dissipation might need to be invoked to explain this emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the initial magnetization @xmath167 is very high , well above @xmath168 , the jet will still be magnetically dominated when it enters the ballistic regime .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the rarefaction - acceleration mechanism can in principle give rise to magnetically accelerated outflows that satisfy @xmath3 . in the standard model of uniform grb jets , this condition allows a late ( on a time scale @xmath169 day ) panchromatic jet break in the afterglow light curve .",
    "however , as the asymptotic structure of magnetically accelerated jets is far from being uniform , further investigation is required to fully establish this result .",
    "furthermore , in some of the grb sources detected by _ swift _",
    "there have been indications of an early ( on a time scale of @xmath5hr ) jet break ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to @xmath170 and @xmath171 , as predicted by pure collimation - acceleration models @xcite . if these inferences are corroborated by further observations , the reasons why certain long / soft grb sources show no evidence of rarefaction acceleration will need to be clarified .",
    "it is , however , also conceivable that the acceleration of jets that exhibit a late break in the afterglow lightcurve is predominantly thermal , since in this case the value of @xmath172 is not limited as in the magnetic acceleration scenario .",
    "one may , however , be able to distinguish between the thermal and magnetic mechanisms  at least in some cases  based on other observational diagnostics , such as the appearance of a photospheric emission component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this issue could potentially be further illuminated by studies of short / hard grb afterglows .",
    "since the outflows in the latter sources evidently do not propagate through a stellar envelope , the rarefaction - acceleration mechanism would not operate in this case ( or at least not in the same way as in long / soft grb sources ) . if short / hard grb outflows are accelerated predominantly by magnetic stresses , this suggests that there should be no late - time breaks in their afterglow lightcurves ( or at least fewer than in the case of long / soft grbs ) . while the data on short / hard grb afterglows are still sparse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this prediction could in principle be tested as more such afterglows are observed .",
