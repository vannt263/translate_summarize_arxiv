    "the tortuous shape in fig .",

    "3 in the case @xmath136 @xmath137 the multi - peaked distribution is very peculiar compared to the poisson s in the usual cs .",

    "the developing from single- to multi - peaked structure as @xmath119 increases can be called self - splitting @xcite which would bring about abundant nonclassical phenomena including quantum interferences if the peaks are located nearby and comparable in heights .",
    "as for higher orders @xmath141 unexpectedly , the self - splitting tends to be less pronounced as seen from fig .",
    "4 . besides getting less tortuous , the more important fact is that the curve decreases much faster for higher @xmath131 hence , for @xmath142 the @xmath119-governed self - splitting is negligible physically . instead , for @xmath143 another kind of splitting , the @xmath0-governed one , appears independent of the lamb - dicke parameter .",

    "the parity gets its intuitive meaning : the state @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) contains only even ( odd ) numbers of quanta and it can be referred to as even ( odd ) ncs @xcite .",
    "this evenness ( oddness ) is also clear from the view point of the decomposition ( [ 13 ] ) according to which @xmath166 @xmath167 by virtue of eqs . ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , @xmath168 and @xmath169 these mean that the combination in eq .",
