    "<S> the searches for magnetic monopoles ( @xmath0s ) is a fascinating interdisciplinary field with implications in fundamental theories , in particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum theory of @xmath0s and its consistency with electrodynamics was derived by p.a.m . </S>",

    "<S> this marked the start of the searches for _ classical monopoles _ at every new accelerator , up to the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic monopoles are required by grand unification theories , but unlike classical monopoles they would be incredibly massive , out of the reach of any conceivable accelerator . </S>",
    "<S> large efforts have been made to search for them in the cosmic radiation as relic particles from the early universe in the widest range of mass and velocity experimentally accessible .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the status of the searches for classical @xmath0s at accelerators , for gut , superheavy @xmath0s in the penetrating cosmic radiation and for intermediate mass @xmath0s at high altitudes is discussed , with emphasis on the most recent results and future perspectives . </S>"
