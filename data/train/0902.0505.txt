    "the recently discovered iron - pnictide high temperature superconductors@xcite have several features in common with the much studied cuprate superconductors .",

    "intriguingly , there is also a common tendency for breaking of the fourfold rotational symmetry of the crystal@xcite which in the case of the cuprates is most likely an intrinsic electronic property related to the strong correlations.@xcite for the pnictides ( as well as in some cases for the cuprates ) there is at low doping a crystal symmetry breaking from tetragonal to orthorombic which is closely connected to an accompanying spin density wave ( sdw ) order.@xcite this interplay between atomic and electronic degrees of freedom naturally leads to the question : what is the role of phonons for the electronic properties of these systems ? focusing on the pnictides , results from density functional theory ( dft)@xcite are credible as they give an electronic spectral distribution consistent with photoemission experiments@xcite but have also found that the electron - phonon coupling is much too weak to explain the high t@xmath10.@xcite challenging these findings was the recent report of an isotope shift of t@xmath10 ( and t@xmath11 ) when substituting @xmath12fe with @xmath13fe with an exponent of @xmath14 close to the bcs value of @xmath15 for a pure iron mode.@xcite the mechanism for superconductivity in the pnictides is a major unresolved issue and it is clearly essential to understand better the lattice - electron interplay .    in this paper",
    "we measure and model one particular raman active phonon which lives primarily on fe atoms and thus common to all iron - pnictide superconductors .",
    "the purpose is to study the anharmonic structure of the fe - as plane with two main objectives : first , to investigate whether any non - phonon contributions are necessary to describe the temperature dependence of the phonon energy and lifetime .",
    "second , to estimate the magnitude of the lattice expansion that follows from substitution with a lighter mass and the corresponding changes in electronic hopping integrals , thus investigating the plausibility of a non - phonon related isotope effect in the pnictides.@xcite    in brief , we model the harmonic spectrum of the as - fe plane and use standard greens function methods to calculate the self energy of the fe b@xmath16 raman phonon to second order in the cubic anharmonic fe - as interatomic coupling . the harmonic spectrum is based on a minimal parameter fit to spectra derived within the local density approximation ( lda ) of dft but the calculation of the temperature dependent contribution from phonon - phonon interactions is beyond the capabilities of that method .",
