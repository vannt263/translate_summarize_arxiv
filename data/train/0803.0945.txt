    "the problem of determining the symmetry of incommensurate ( ic ) magnetic order from diffraction experiments is an old one and is the subject of several well - known reviews.@xcite the reviews are based on the idea that the spin structure that develops at a continuous transition must transform like an irreducible representation ( irrep ) of the group of operations which leaves the ic wave vector @xmath0 invariant.@xcite however , perhaps surprisingly , these standard references do not exploit additional restrictions that are due to inversion symmetry when that operation is not a member of the group of the wave vector .",
    "although the group theoretical formalism for doing this has been described@xcite and these restrictions had previously been used to aid in structure determinations,@xcite the effect of inversion symmetry is often not included in the classification of possible magnetic structures .",
    "here we perform the requisite analysis for the star of wave vectors of the ic phases@xcite of the  125 \" systems , rmn@xmath1o@xmath2 , where r is a rare earth ion , which may be magnetic or not ( _ e . g. _ when r is yttrium ) .",
    "the interest in these materials stems from the fact that they exhibit ferroelectricity@xcite whose onset coincides with a magnetic ordering transition.@xcite we show that when inversion symmetry is taken into account , there are about half as many degrees of freedom that describe the basis functions of the irreducible representations compared to an analysis when inversion symmetry is overlooked . even when an unrestricted fit ( not taking account of any symmetry ) is performed,@xcite it is useful to have the results of the present paper to see if the hypothesis of a single irrep@xcite holds .",
    "thus , it is clear that magnetic structure determination using an approach that includes inversion symmetry will lead to an increase in the accuracy of the structure determinations .",
    "finally , this approach leads naturally to the introduction of order parameters which have symmetry properties that we explicitly display and in terms of which a landau expansion was developed for a number of systems@xcite and which has led to a generic magnetoelectric ( me ) phase diagram for the 125s.@xcite the purpose of the present paper is to a ) analyze the symmetry of the various ic phases , b ) show how the symmetry implies relations between order parameters of different symmetry magnetic phases , and c ) analyze the symmetry of the me interactions which explain the appearance of ferroelectric order at some of the magnetic phase transitions .",

    "it happens that the wyckoff orbit of this set of operators generates the entire set of spine sites and also separately the entire set of cross - tie sites . in that case",
    "inversion ( which does not leave the wave vector invariant ) fixes all the relative phases.@xcite ( the phases are not necessarily the same , but they are fixed . ) in the case of tmo the mn sites form a wyckoff orbit of the symmetry operations that leave the wave vector invariant , but the tb sites break into two orbits . in this case inversion",

    "so it is not surprising that this situation is like that of the tb sites in tmo : the magnitudes of the two related orbits , which according to mody were unrelated , are now , by virtue of inversion symmetry , fixed to be the same .",
    "it is natural to introduce order parameters because as the temperature is reduced into the ordered phase , the critical eigenvector is nearly temperature - independent except for a change in its normalization , governed by the magnitude of the order parameter .",
    "furthermore , the phase of the complex order parameter is either a free variable or , if it is fixed , it is only fixed by subtle effects of higher - than - quadratic terms in the free energy .",
    "so the order parameter describes properly the low energy sector of the free energy .",
    "note that our definition of the order parameter is such that if one is given the spin wave function over all the sublattices it is possible to uniquely determine both the phase and the magnitude of the order parameter , except that it could be multiplied by @xmath199 .",

    "then the prefactor will be the desired order parameter .",
    "note that the phase is fixed by having the first and fourth components written in terms of complex conjugates .",
    "this type of identification would not be possible for a one - component complex variable .",
    "it should be noted that the order parameter inherits the symmetry of the full wave function .",

    "we will discuss the trilinear me interaction which involves the lowest number ( two ) of magnetic order parameters . in succeeding subsections we will discuss higher order me interactions which involve a product of four magnetic order parameters .",
    "these higher order terms yield components of the spontaneous polarization which are allowed by symmetry but are not present in the trilinear interaction",
    ". however , these higher - order terms are probably small for two reasons .",
    "firstly , in the ic phases which occur at high temperatures near the paramagnetic phase , the order parameters are small .",
    "secondly , most microscopic models of the me interaction@xcite treat ( within lowest order perturbation theory ) a trilinear hamiltonian involving two spin variables and one displacement variable .",
    "however , to obtain these higher order phenomenological interactions probably involve processes of higher order in some small parameter such as @xmath335 or @xmath336 , where @xmath337 is a hopping matrix element , @xmath111 is the spin - orbit constant , and @xmath338 is a coulomb interaction .",
    "initially we will consider the lowest order ( trilinear ) me coupling .",
    "we start by considering the case when only the wave vectors @xmath339 , where @xmath43 may or may not be zero , are involved .",
    "the interaction of lowest order in the magnetic order parameters which conserves wave vector and is time - reversal invariant is of the form@xcite @xmath340 where @xmath341 and @xmath12 assume the values",
    " e \" and  o \" , @xmath342 is the spontaneous electric polarization and @xmath343 labels the component.@xcite using table [ trans ] , one sees that terms in @xmath344 with @xmath345 are not allowed by inversion invariance .",
    "if one has only a single irrep present , then one can always redefine the location of the origin so as to have inversion symmetry with respect to that new origin and hence such a phase can not exhibit magnetically induced ferroelectricity .",
    "if both irreps are present , then we write @xmath346 p_\\gamma \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and inversion invariance forces @xmath347 to be pure imaginary : @xmath348 , where @xmath349 is real",
    ". then @xmath350 p_\\gamma \\ . \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from table [ trans ]",
    "one sees that the square bracket in this equation changes sign under @xmath52 , so @xmath351 must also change sign under @xmath52 in order for @xmath344 to be invariant under @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath347 can be nonzero only for @xmath352 , as is observed .",
    "if we set latexmath:[$\\sigmav_\\gamma({\\bf q}_+)=    result latexmath:[\\ ] ]",
    "we have performed a representation analysis of the magnetic order for the ic phase of the rmn@xmath1o@xmath2 series by including inversion symmetry , thereby reducing by about half the number of degrees of freedom allowed for magnetic ordering .",
    "our results emphasize that a full inclusion of inversion symmetry is necessary to determine the magnetic structure and associated order parameters , not only in multiferroics , but also in a wide range of magnetic materials .",
    "we have also determined the physically important order parameters and have analyzed the transformation properties which they inherit from the wave functions . using these symmetry properties",
    "we have analyzed the magnetoelectric interaction responsible for the simultaneous magnetic and dielectric phase transitions .",
    "the lowest order magnetoelectric interaction , which is bilinear in the magnetic order parameters , explains the observed direction of the spontaneous polarization .",
    "we have shown that higher order and _ umklapp _ magnetoelectric interactions ( which are quartic in the spin variables ) can induce nonzero values for all components of the spontaneous polarization , but since the order parameters are small in the relevant phases and since microscopic mechanisms tend to involve terms quadratic in the spin variables , these anomalous components to the spontaneous polarization may be very difficult to observe .",
    "we have also explicitly obtained the compatibility relations for the transition between the ic phase and the cm phase ( or more generally the phase where the @xmath386-component of wave vector is locked to its cm value ) .",
