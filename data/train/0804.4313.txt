    "transition metal nitrides are of intense interest for researchers.@xcite not only do they offer the fundamental scientific challenge of finding methods to control , tune and enhance their peculiar physical properties , but they also have important technical applications such as cutting tools,@xcite oxidation - resisting materials,@xcite optical and magnetic apparatus.@xcite transition metal nitrides possess particular mechanical , optical , electric , and magnetic properties , which attribute to their unusual electronic bonding ( a mixture of covalent , metallic , and ionic bondings ) and strong electron - phonon interaction . the higher valence electron density ( ved ) and the stronger hybridization between transition metal _ d _ electrons and nonmetal _",
    "p _ electrons as well as less elastic anisotropy make some of them exhibit large incompressibility and high hardness , considered as powerful candidates of superhard materials.@xcite    at present , there are three kinds of transition metal nitrides confirmed : x@xmath3n@xmath4 ( x = hf , zr),@xcite yn@xmath5 ( y = pt , ir , os),@xcite and zn ( z = ti , ta , nb , mo).@xcite many works , including determination of the structure , discussion of elastic and electrical properties , have been carried out theoretically and experimentally.@xcite the interaction of experiment and first - principles calculation has become a powerful tool to predict , test and confirm the structure of the new materials.@xcite for example , jointing experiment and first - principles calculation , osn@xmath5,@xcite irn@xmath5@xcite and @xmath6-mon@xcite were identified as orthorhombic @xmath7 , monoclinic @xmath8 and hexagonal @xmath9 structures , respectively . the sites of nitrogen atoms in unit cell can be confirmed by theoretical calculation , which makes it possible to deeply study the mechanical , electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal nitrides .",
    "haq and meyer@xcite reported the superconducting and electrical properties of re@xmath10n@xmath11 ( @xmath12=0.13@xmath130.5 ) by means of ion implantation experimental technique .",
    "the rhenium nitride with @xmath14 structure was observed and the corresponding superconducting temperature @xmath15 value of 4.5 - 5.0 k was obtained .",
    "however , isaev _ _ et al__@xcite pointed out that transitional metal mononitrides with ten and more valence electrons in the nacl - type structure are dynamically unstable which has been verified in mon and nbn . @xcite as such , ren with face centered cubic structure maybe unstable mechanically .",
    "so the crystal structure of ren remains an open question to date .",
    "moreover , to the best of our knowledge , the mechanical property of ren has not been reported .    in this paper , the structural , mechanical and electronic properties of ren are investigated by first - principles calculations . because most of the transition - metal mono - nitrides are known to be generally based on cubic or hexagonal metal sublattice , and n atoms occupy octahedral or trigonal prismatic interstitial sites , therefore , all the possible cubic and hexagonal structures are chosen as candidate structures of ren , including zinc blende ( zb ) ( space group @xmath16 ) , rocksalt ( nacl ) ( space group @xmath17 ) , cscl ( space group @xmath18 ) , wc ( space group @xmath19 ) , and nias types ( space group @xmath0).@xcite then incompressibility and elastic anisotropy are discussed .",
    "further , the superconduction transition temperature @xmath1 of ren is estimated using the modified mcmillan equation by allen and dynes.@xcite finally , the electronic property of ren is given by electron structure calculation and mulliken atomic population analysis .",
    "our calculations on structural and electronic properties of ren are based on the full - potential linearized augmented plane waves plus local orbitals method ( fp - lapw)@xcite as implemented in the wien2k package to solve the scalar - relativistic kohn - sham equations.@xcite for the exchange correlation energy functional , the local density approximation ( lda ) is employed .",
    "the muffin - tin radii are set to 1.9 and 1.60 bohr for re and n , respectively .",
    "the maximum value @xmath20 for the wave function expansion inside the atomic spheres is limited to 10 .",
    "we expand the basis function up to _",
    "_ r__@xmath21__k__@xmath22=7.0 ( _ _ k__@xmath22 is the maximum modulus of the reciprocal lattice vector ) . full relativistic approximation is used for the core electrons , and scalar relativistic approximation is used for the valence electrons of 5__s__5__p__4__f__5__d__6__s _ _ for re and of 2__s__2__p _ _ for n. the self - consistent cycle",
    "is achieved by taking 1200 points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the convergence has been followed with respect to the energy and density .",
    "the elastic constants of ren are obtained within the framework of the finite strain technique by castep code using first - principles plane - wave basis pseudopotential method ( pw - pp ) based on dft.@xcite all the possible structures are also optimized by the bfgs algorithm@xcite which provides a fast way of finding the lowest energy structure and supports cell optimization in the castep code . in the calculation ,",
    "the interaction between the ions and the electrons is described by using vanderbilt s supersoft pseudopotential with the cutoff energy of 310 ev . in the geometrical optimization , all forces on atoms are converged to less than 0.002 ev /  , all the stress components are less than 0.02 gpa , and the tolerance in self - consistent field ( scf ) calculation is 5.0@xmath2310@xmath24 ev / atom .",
    "relaxation of the internal degrees of freedom is allowed at each unit cell compression or expansion . from the full elastic constant tensor",
    "we determine the bulk modulus @xmath25 and the shear modulus @xmath26 according to the voigt - reuss - hill ( vrh ) approximation.@xcite the young s modulus , @xmath27 , and possion s ratio , @xmath28 , can be calculated by the formulae @xmath29 .",
    "the equilibrium volume , bulk modulus and its pressure derivative are obtained by fitting the total energy calculated at different volumes to the 3-rd order birch - murnaghan equation of state.@xcite the equilibrium structural parameters , density , valence electron density , the total energy , as well as the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative obtained from fp - lapw method are listed in table i. the energy - volume curve is plotted in fig .",
    "ren is more energetically stable in the hexagonal structure under ambient pressure than cubic structure and nias - ren structure is most stable , as shown in table i and fig .",
    "1 . in nias - ren",
    "( space group @xmath0 ) the unit cell contains two chemical formula units ( f.u . )",
    "in which two re atoms are at @xmath30 ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and two n atoms at @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) sites .",
    "the equilibrium volumes per formula unit ( f.u . ) are 23.5037 @xmath35 for zb - ren , 19.5258 @xmath35 for nacl - ren , 18.9065 @xmath35 for cscl - ren , 19.4775 @xmath35 for wc - ren , and 19.0162 @xmath35 for nias - ren , which are higher than that of re metal ( 14.7173 @xmath35)@xcite due to the adding of n atoms .",
    "we note that the expansion of lattice when incorporating the n in the pure re is not high enough to compensate for the decrease for the interatomic distance between the first neighbors .",
    "the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath36 between atoms in ren is much less than that of re ( which is about 2.74  ) , which means that ren maybe possess the much higher bulk modulus than pure re metal ( discussed later ) .",
    "the densities of ren are 14.1476 , 17.0299 , 17.5877 , 17.0721 , and 17.4862 g / cm@xmath35 , for zb - ren , nacl - ren , cscl - ren , wc - ren , and nias - ren , respectively .",
    "the valence electron shell of re is @xmath38@xmath39 , and that of n is @xmath40 so the total valence electron number is 12 per ren molecule .",
    "the calculated veds are 0.5106 electrons / @xmath35 for zb - ren , 0.6146 electrons / @xmath35 for nacl - ren , 0.6347 electrons / @xmath35 for cscl - ren , 0.6162 electrons/@xmath41 for wc structure , and 0.6310 electrons / @xmath35 for nias - ren .",
    "it is worthy to note that all veds for these three structures are higher than that of re metal ( 0.4761 electrons / @xmath35)@xcite and are compared with 0.70 electrons / @xmath35 for diamond.@xcite generally , the higher ved , the stronger the incompressibility .",
    "in addition , from table i , it is clear that the bulk modulus of ren is larger than that ( 360 gpa)@xcite of re metal except for zb - ren ( unstable mechanically ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ren is less compressible than the pure re .",
    "it is delighted that the estimated bulk modulus of ren with nias , cscl , and wc structures is even comparable to that of diamond,@xcite which means that the ren with these structures has a stronger incompressibility , indicating that ren can be a candidate of superhard material .    in order to get more accurate elastic constants of ren using pw - pp scheme ,",
    "all considered structures are optimized firstly.@xcite the calculated elastic constants are presented in table ii . for a stable hexagonal structure , the five independent elastic constants @xmath42 ( @xmath43,@xmath44,@xmath45,@xmath46 and @xmath47 ) should satisfy the well known born - huang criteria for stability:@xcite @xmath48 while for cubic crystal , the three independent elastic constants @xmath42 ( @xmath43,@xmath46 and @xmath45 ) satisfy inequalities:@xcite @xmath49 clearly , our calculated elastic constants @xmath42 for both cubic cscl - ren and the hexagonal nias - ren satisfy the born - huang stability criteria , suggesting that they are mechanically stable .",
    "cubic zb - ren and nacl types are unstable mechanically because of their negative @xmath45 .",
    "our results stand by for isaev s viewpoint of which the transition metal mononitrides with ten and more valence electrons in the nacl - type structure are unstable mechanically .",
    "wc - ren type is also unstable mechanically due to the very small @xmath45 value ( near zero ) . in the following",
    ", only cscl and nias types of ren are discussed .    from the elastic constants calculated above ,",
    "bulk modulus @xmath25 , shear modulus @xmath26 , young s modulus @xmath27 , and possion s ratio @xmath28 are obtained and listed in table ii , which are important in order to understand the elastic properties of ren .",
    "the bulk modulus of ren calculated by using elastic constants agrees well with the one obtained through the fit to the 3rd order birch - murnaghan eos , which shows that the discussion - above on compressibility of ren is reasonable . to further discuss the incompressibility of ren , the evolution of the volume compressions as a function of pressure are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . for comparison ,",
    "the volume compression of diamond is given simultaneously .",
    "it is evident that ren with nias structure is slight higher incompressible than diamond , while ren with cscl structure has slightly less incompressible than diamond in the entire pressure range ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .    to explain the directional dependence of compression , fraction axis compression as a function of pressure for diamond and two structures of ren are given in fig .",
    "3 . compression of the axes presents interesting anisotropy . for hexagonal nial - ren , the @xmath50 axis is more incompressible than the @xmath51 axis .",
    "the incompressibility along @xmath51-axis is slightly less than that of diamond , while @xmath50 axis is even more incompressible than the analogous axis of diamond .",
    "while for cubic cscl - ren , it is slightly lower incompressible than diamond ( fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 ) . therefore",
    ", we can claim that ren is an ultra - incompressible solid .",
    "the shear modulli obtained are 248 gpa for cscl - ren and 237 gpa for nias - ren , and corresponding @xmath52 values are 0.588 and 0.526 .",
    "the possion s ratio is 0.25 and 0.28 for cscl and nias types , respectively , which indicates that ren has central interatomic forces and is relatively stable against shear.@xcite the high @xmath52 ratio or , equivalently , the low poisson s ratio also implies a high value degree of covalency .",
    "it is well known that the elastic anisotropy of crystals has significant application in engineering science since it is highly correlated with both the hardness of materials and the possibility to induce microcracks in the materials . hence it is important to calculate elastic anisotropy in order to understand the properties and improve the durability of materials .",
    "the anisotropy factor for cubic cscl - ren , @xmath53=@xmath54=0.45 , shows that cubic cscl - ren is elastic anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy of linear compression along the @xmath51 axis and @xmath50 axis with respect to the @xmath55 axis can be evaluated by means of two parameters : @xmath56 and @xmath57,@xcite where a value of 1 indicates compression isotropy and any departure from one corresponds to a degree of compression anisotropy . for low symmetry crystal ,",
    "the percentage of anisotropy in compressibility and shear can be derived from two expressions , bulk modulus anisotropic factor @xmath58 and shear anisotropy factor @xmath59 , respectively.@xcite the calculated linear compression parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and two other anisotropy factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 are listed in table iii .",
    "nias - ren is almost isotropy in compressibility ( 0.317% ) and has slightly shear anisotropy ( @xmath59=4.199% ) . from table iii",
    ", one can see that cubic cscl - ren is compression isotropy , and hexagonal ren s @xmath50 axis has much stronger incompressibility than that of @xmath51 axis , which is in good agreement with fractional axis compression analysis mentioned above .",
    "the small elastic anisotropy of nias - ren , including linearized compressibility and shear anisotropy , along with the ultra - high bulk modulus and the higher shear modulus ( or @xmath45 ) , indicates that nias - ren can be as a good candidate of superhard material . comparing @xmath45 with shear modulus for hexagonal nias - ren",
    ", we find that they are almost the same , imaging that nias - ren hardness can be given a consistent estimation by the viewpoints on hardness from teter@xcite and jhi _ _ et al.__@xcite . here",
    ", using the correlation between shear modulus and vickers harness given by teter , the estimated vickers hardness of ren are 33.6 gpa for cscl - ren and 32.1 gpa for nias - ren , and 36.2 gpa for mon - ren .",
    "all the hardness of ren presented here are comparable to that of b@xmath60o ( 35@xmath615gpa ) and that of tib@xmath5 ( 33@xmath612gpa).@xcite    the debye temperature correlates with many physical properties of solids , such as elastic constants , specific heat , melting temperature and superconduction transition temperature .",
    "since the vibrational excitations mainly arise from acoustic vibrations at low temperature , the debye temperature obtained from elastic constants is the same as that determined from specific heat measurements .",
    "the debye temperature can be derived by bulk modulus , shear modulus and density @xmath62.@xcite the calculated debye temperature @xmath63s are as high as 968 k for cscl - ren and 950 k for nias - ren , which indicates that ren maybe a superconductor .",
    "so , we further estimate the superconducting transition temperature of ren with nias structure using the modified mcmillan equation,@xcite where the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath64 is calculated by density - functional perturbation theory by means of the quantum espresso package.@xcite the calculated @xmath64 is 1.67 and the estimated superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 is about 4.8 k for the screened coulomb pseudopotential @xmath65 equal to 0.1 , which agrees well with available experimental result.@xcite to understand the correlation between the electronic properties and the mechanical properties , we present density of states ( dos ) and the electron density distribution of ren in the equilibrium geometry .",
    "electronic structure properties play an important role in material physical properties .",
    "the total density of states ( dos ) and partial dos of two phases of ren are shown in fig . 4 and fig .",
    "the obtained @xmath66 and the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath67 are given in table i. the finite value @xmath66 shows that ren is a metal .",
    "for two phases , the electrons from re-_d _ and the n-_p _ states both contribute to the dos near the fermi level .",
    "the peak emerging in the lower energy region of the dos curve mainly originates from the localized _",
    "s _ states of n. the energy region just above fermi level is dominated by unoccupied re _ d _ states .",
    "the dos of re-_d _ and n-_p _ are energetically degenerate from the bottom of the valence band to the top of conduction band , indicating the possibility of covalent bonding between re and n atoms . the covalent characteristic between re and n atoms can be confirmed by the charge density distribution . the charge density distribution in ( 110 )",
    "plane for cscl - ren and ( 11@xmath680 ) plane for nias - ren are shown in fig . 6 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "it is clearly seen that a strong directional bonding exists between re and n in the ren , which contributes to high bulk modulus @xmath25 , namely , strong incompressibility of ren .",
    "additionally , the mulliken atomic population analysis is carried out by using castep code .",
    "the obtained total charge transfer from re to n in cscl - ren ( nias - ren ) is 0.55 ( 0.62 ) , implying that the chemical bondings between re and n have some characteristics of ionicity .",
    "thus our results demonstrate that the bondings should be a mixture of covalent , mental , and ionic attribution in ren .",
    "the structural , elastic , and electronic properties of different structures for ren are investigated based on first - principles calculation under the framework of density functional theory within local density approximation .",
    "two competing structures , i.e. , cscl - ren and nias - ren , are found .",
    "high valence electron density , strong incompressibility and low elastic anisotropy indicate that ren is an ultra - incompressible superhard solid .",
    "electron structure calculation shows that ren presents an obvious metal feature .",
    "in particular , we obtain a superconducting transition temperature @xmath1@xmath24.8 k for hexagonal ren .",
    "the strong hybridization between metal _ d_-electron and nonmetal _",
    "p_-electron are observed , indicating that there is a strong covalent bonding between re and n. from mulliken atomic population analysis along with discussion of mechanical and electronic properties , it can be concluded that the bondings in ren should be a mixing of metal , ionic and covalent characteristics .",
    "our results indicate that ren can be used as a potential ultra - incompressible conductor .",
    "we hope this work can stimulate the experimental research for ren .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation of china under grant nos 10504036 and 90503005 , the special funds for major state basic research project of china(973 ) under grant no .",

    "part of the calculations were performed in the shanghai supercomputer center .",
    "the @xmath6-mon ( space group @xmath69 ) type is also considered in our research .",
    "it is found that @xmath6-mon type is also stable mechanically and has a strong incompressibility ( bulk modulus @xmath25 , 451 gpa ; shear modulus @xmath26 , 267 gpa ) .",
    "symmetry analysis show that the mon - ren structure is a slight distortion of the supercell ( 2@xmath232@xmath231 ) of nias - ren structure . the unit cell ( _ _ a__=5.4981 and _",
