    "one of the main goals of the present and next generation ultrapure liquid scintillator detectors , such as kamland @xcite , borexino @xcite , sno+ @xcite and lena @xcite , is the determination of the neutrino fluxes produced by the cno cycle in the sun .    despite being sub - dominant in the sun , the cno cycle @xcite has a key role in astrophysics , being the prominent source of energy in more massive stars and in advanced evolutionary stages of solar like stars , see @xcite . the evaluation of cno efficiency is connected with various interesting problems , like e.g. the determination of globular clusters age @xcite from which we extract a lower limit to the age of the universe . at the moment , we still miss a direct observational evidence for cno energy generation in the sun .",
    "we only have a loose upper limit on cno luminosity , @xmath7 , obtained by combining the results of the various solar neutrino experiments . the most recent solar standard model ( ssm ) @xcite",
    "predicts the cno contribution to the sun s luminosity to be equal to about 0.7% .",
    "experimental bounds report @xmath8% at 99% c.l . , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the detection of cno solar neutrinos would clearly provide a direct test of the cno cycle efficiency .",
    "the measurement of the cno solar neutrino flux can also provide clues to solve the so called `` solar composition problem '' .",
    "the flux is , in fact , directly related to the abundance of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen in the sun .",
    "the photospheric abundances of these ( and other ) heavy elements have been recently re - determined @xcite , indicating that the sun metallicity is lower than previously assumed @xcite .",
    "solar models that incorporate these lower abundances are no more able to reproduce the helioseismic results .",
    "detailed studies have been done to solve this discrepancy , see e.g. @xcite , but a definitive solution of this problem is still missing .    the above points show the importance of cno solar neutrinos detection which , however , is a very difficult task .",
    "not only the flux is relatively low , but also their energy is not large .",
    "the neutrinos produced in the cno cycle have continuous energy spectra with endpoints at about @xmath9 mev with an endpoint at @xmath10 mev and the o - neutrinos produced by @xmath11 with an endpoint at @xmath12 mev . ] . differently from the monochromatic",
    "be and pep solar neutrinos , they do not produce specific spectral features that permit to extract them unambiguously from the background event spectrum in high purity liquid scintillators .",
    "in particular , as it is shown in fig.[spectrum ] , the electrons produced by the @xmath0-decay of bismuth-210 to polonium-210 have a spectrum that is similar to that produced by cno neutrinos . as a consequence ,",
    "spectral fits are able to determine only combined `` bismuth+cno '' contribution , as it is done e.g. by borexino in @xcite .    in order to remove this degeneracy",
    ", we propose a simple method to determine the bi-210 decay rate which is based on the relationship between the bi-210 and po-210 abundances .",
    "polonium-210 , which is the bismuth-210 daughter , is unstable and decays with a lifetime @xmath13 days emitting a monochromatic @xmath3 particle that can be easily detected . in the absence of bismuth-210",
    ", the @xmath4decay rate of po-210 nuclei follows the exponential decay law , @xmath14 .",
    "the deviations from this behaviour can be used to determine the @xmath15decay rate of bi-210 nuclei .",
    "the only required assumptions are that the @xmath3 particle detection efficiency is stable and external sources of po-210 are negligible during the data acquisition period .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    ", we determine the relationship between the @xmath4decay rate of po-210 , @xmath16 , and the @xmath15decay rate of bi-210 , @xmath17 . in sect.[determination ] , we estimate the accuracy @xmath18 of the bi-210 decay rate determination as a function of the detector mass @xmath19 , the data acquisition period @xmath20 and the initial polonium decay rate @xmath21 . in sect.[implications ]",
    ", we discuss the implications of the proposed approach for cno neutrino signal extraction . in sect.[conclusions ] , we summarize our results .     for details .",
    "bismuth-210 and polonium-210 are both daughter of @xmath22 .",
    "bismuth-210 is produced by the slow decay of lead-210 which has a lifetime equal to @xmath23 .",
    "it then undergoes a @xmath24 decay to polonium-210 : @xmath25 with a lifetime @xmath26 .",
    "the electrons produced in the decay have a continuous spectrum with an endpoint @xmath27 that lays over the event spectrum produced by cno neutrinos , see fig.[spectrum ] . in the analysis of the 192 days",
    "data @xcite , borexino obtained an event rate equal to about @xmath28 @xcite for the combined contribution provided by bismuth+cno neutrinos . for reference",
    ", we consider that the expected cno neutrino signal is equal to about 5  cpd/100ton as predicted by the ssm and the lma - msw scenario ( see sect.[implications ] for details ) .",
    "polonium-210 is also unstable and undergoes @xmath3 decay to lead-206 : @xmath29 with a lifetime @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath3 particles produced in the decay have an energy @xmath31 , but they are observed at a much lower effective energy , due to the large quenching factor of alpha particles in liquid scintillators . they produce a sharp peak superimposed to the low energy part of the @xmath32 neutrino event rate at a visible energy @xmath33 , see fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "naively , one could expect that secular equilibrium between bismuth-210 and polonium-210 is obtained , which would imply that the rate of @xmath0 decays of bi-210 is equal to the rate of @xmath3 decays of po-210 . however , this is not the case in practical situations .",
    "borexino , in fact , observes a po-210 abundance which is about a factor 100 larger than what implied by secular equilibrium and that corresponds to an initial alpha decay rate of the order @xmath34 @xcite . the large counting rate permits to determine the polonium activity with a high accuracy .",
    "we remark that the @xmath3 particles emitted in the decay , beside producing the very distinctive spectral feature shown in fig.[spectrum ] , can be directly identified by using a pulse shape discrimination .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite a high purity liquid scintillator could have very good @xmath35 discrimination properties . a figure - of - merit based on the gatti discrimination technique",
    "@xcite has been used in borexino to produce an @xmath3-subtracted spectrum where the po-210 background is removed .",
    "the relationship between the po-210 and the bi-210 abundances can be quantified in a very simple way .",
    "we have that : @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the number of polonium-210 ( bismuth-210 ) nuclei per unit mass in the detector at a time @xmath39 , and @xmath40 indicates any possible external source of polonium-210 ( i.e. not related to @xmath22 decay chain ) .",
    "the solution of eq .",

    "we assume that , during a data acquisition period , after liquid scintillator purification , external sources of polonium can be neglected , i.e. @xmath47 . in this assumption , the @xmath4decay rate of polonium and the @xmath15decay rate of bismuth , given by : @xmath48 respectively , follow the relation : @xmath49 the above equation provides all the ingredients that are necessary for our analysis .",
    "it shows that , if we are able to measure @xmath16 as a function of time with a high accuracy , we can provide an estimate for @xmath17 , which is the main background for cno neutrinos detection .",
    "the main observation of this letter is that , due to the high statistics of po-210 events , the beta - activity of bi-210 nuclei can be extracted from the time evolution of polonium-210 counting rate in a relatively short time ( i.e.  comparable with polonium lifetime ) .",
    "it is not necessary , in particular , to wait that secular equilibrium between polonium-210 and bismuth-210 is reached , which would require much longer times .",

    "the possibility to determine the bi-210 event rate represents an important step forward in the direction of cno solar neutrino detection , as can be immediately understood by looking at the expected event spectrum in liquid scintillator detectors in fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum was calculated by assuming the solar neutrino fluxes predicted by @xcite and the oscillation parameters corresponding to the lma - msw solution of the solar neutrino problem given by @xcite .",
    "the integrated rates are @xmath82 from beryllium neutrinos , @xmath83 for pep neutrinos and @xmath84 for boron neutrinos .",
    "the cno neutrino signal is taken as @xmath85 that corresponds to the prediction obtained by using the high photospheric metal abundances of @xcite .",

    "we see that the cno neutrino fluxes are not expected to produce significant and/or recognizable features anywhere in spectrum ( see fig.[spectrum ] ) . as a consequence , spectral fits are unable to constrain the cno signal .",

    "the degeneracy between bi-210 and cno neutrinos is removed when we use the time evolution of the po-210 contribution to determine the bi-210 background . by performing a fit to the simulated data _ in the domain of energy and time _ and taking advantage of eq.([eq - final ] ) between po-210 and bi-210 rates ,",
