    "this paper concerns with the chord index and it applications in virtual knot theory and twisted knot theory . virtual knot theory , which was introduced by l. kauffman in @xcite , studies the embeddings of @xmath0 in @xmath1 $ ] up to isotopy and stabilizations . here",
    "@xmath2 denotes a closed orientable surface with genus @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath4 , virtual knot theory reduces to the classical knot theory .",
    "it was first observed by kauffman @xcite that each real crossing point of a virtual knot can be assigned with a parity , and a kind of self - linking number , the odd writhe , was proved to be a virtual knot invariant .",
    "later this idea was extended by mantutov in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we introduced the notion of chord index , which assigns an integer to each real crossing point such that the parity of it exactly equals the parity that introduced by kauffman .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to provide some applications of the chord index in virtual knot theory and its extension , the twisted knot theory .",
    "first , we would like to discuss how to construct finite type invariants of virtual knots by using chord index .",
    "a well - known result in finite type invariant theory is , for classical knots there is no finite type invariant of degree one .",
    "however for virtual knots this is not the case . in @xcite sawollek",
    "used a degree one finite type invariant to distinguish between a virtual knot and its inverse . later in @xcite henrich defined three degree one finite type invariants for virtual knots , and",
    "the strongest one is a  universal \" degree one finite type invariant for virtual knots ( do not confuse this",
    " universal \" invariant with the kontsevich integral @xcite , we refer the reader to @xcite for the precise definition of this ",
    "universal \" finite type invariant ) .",
    "the first application of the chord index is investigating how to construct finite type invariants of virtual knots in general cases .    as the second application of the chord index , we introduce a sequence of jones polynomials , say the indexed jones polynomial . by ignoring all virtual crossing points ,",
    "the classical jones polynomial can be naturally defined for virtual knots with the help of kauffman bracket .",
    "we remark that if @xmath5 is a classical knot , then jones polynomial @xmath6 takes value in @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "however for a virtual knot @xmath5 , the jones polynomial of @xmath5 takes value in @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "therefore if @xmath6 contains nonzero coefficient for some term @xmath9 @xmath10 , then we conclude that @xmath5 is not classical . on the other hand",
    "when @xmath5 is a proper alternating virtual knot diagram , n. kamada proved that the span of @xmath11 @xcite , here @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the crossing number and supporting genus of @xmath5 respectively . later in @xcite",
    "the classical jones polynomial was generalized by manturov to the parity skein relation polynomial invariant .",
    "similar idea was used to define the parity arrow polynomial and its categorification @xcite . in this paper , by using the chord index , the set of real crossing points is divided into several subsets . for each subset",
    "we introduce an indexed jones polynomial associated to it .",
    "analogous to the classical case , we show that each indexed jones polynomial provides a lower bound for the cardinality of the corresponding subset .",
    "thirdly , we introduce the notion of indexed quandle . roughly speaking ,",
    "an indexed quandle is a set with a sequence of binary operations ( indexed by @xmath14 ) which satisfies certain axioms .",
    "when all operations coincide the indexed quandle reduces to the classical quandle structure , which was first introduced in @xcite . therefore the indexed quandle can be thought of as an extension of the classical quandle . for each virtual knot @xmath5",
    "we define the indexed knot quandle of it , denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "this invariant is equivalent to the fundamental quandle of @xmath5 when @xmath5 is a classical knot .",
    "but for virtual knots , we give some examples to show that it contains much more information than the fundamental quandle .",
    "in particular , with a given finite indexed quandle @xmath16 one can define the coloring invariant @xmath17 by counting the homomorphisms from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . as an analogue of the quandle cocycle invariants @xcite",
    ", we define the indexed quandle cocycle invariants .",
    "some examples are given to reveal that this cocycle invariant is more powerful than the coloring invariant .    in section 6 the definition of the chord index",
    "is revisited .",
    "we want to understand what is a chord index essentially .",
    "as we understand it , the chord index can be regarded as a particular biquandle cocycle . in this way",
    "we discuss how to generalize the definition of the chord index for virtual links .",
    "the last section is devoted to investigate the chord index and its applications in twisted knot theory .",
    "let @xmath2 be a closed orientable surface with genus @xmath3 and @xmath5 an embedded circle in @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "assume we have another embedded circle @xmath19 $ ] , we say @xmath5 and @xmath20 are _ stably equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other one by isotopy in the thickened surfaces , homeomorphisms of the surfaces and addition or subtraction of empty handles .",
    "we define the _ virtual knots _ to be the stable equivalence classes of circles embedded in thickened surfaces . for a virtual knot @xmath5 the minimal genus of the surface @xmath2",
    "is called the _ supporting genus _ of @xmath5 . by using some classical technique in 3-manifold topology ,",
    "kuperberg @xcite proved that the embedding of a virtual knot in the minimal supporting genus thickened surface is unique .",
    "it follows that if two classical knots are stably equivalent as virtual knots , then they are also equivalent as classical knots .",
    "this implies the virtual knot theory is indeed an extension of the classical knot theory .    from the diagrammatic viewpoint",
    "a virtual knot can be interpreted by virtual knot diagrams .",
    "a virtual knot diagram is an immersed circle in the plane with finitely many double points . by replacing each double point with an overcrossing , or an undercrossing , or a virtual crossing ( denoted by a small cricle )",
    "we obtain a virtual knot diagram .",
    "obviously if there exists no virtual crossing the virtual knot diagram represents a classical knot .",
    "we say a pair of virtual knot diagrams are _ equivalent _ if they can be connected by a sequence of generalized reidemeister moves , see figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "+    now we can define _ virtual knots _ as the equivalence classes of virtual knot diagrams up to generalized reidemeister moves .",
    "the two definitions above are closely related .",
    "assume we have a embedded circle in a thickened surface , now consider a projection of the circle to the plane in general position .",
    "if the preimage of a double point is an overcrossing ( undercrossing ) in the thickened surface , then we still use an overcrossing ( undercrossing ) to denote it . if the two strands of the preimage of a double point locate in two different levels , then we use a virtual crossing to denote it . in other words ,",
    "the virtual crossings can be regarded as artifacts of the projection of the surface to the plane .",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "conversely , suppose we have a virtual knot diagram @xmath5 on the plane . by taking one - point compactification",
    "we obtain a virtual knot diagram on @xmath21 . for each virtual",
    "crossing we add a 2-handle locally to eliminate the crossing .",
    "finally we obtain an embedded circle in @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 denotes the number of virtual crossings in @xmath5 .",
    "the following theorem shows that the two definitions above are equivalent .",
    "two virtual knot diagrams are equivalent if and only if their corresponding surface embeddings are stably equivalent .",
    "another way to understand virtual knots is to regard them as gauss diagrams .",
    "let @xmath5 be a virtual knot diagram , which can be seen as an immersed circle in the plane .",
    "consider the preimage of this immersed circle with an anticlockwise orientation .",
    "for each real crossing point , we draw a chord directed from the preimage of the overcrossing to the preimage of the undercrossing .",
    "finally we assign a sign to each chord according to the sign(writhe ) of the corresponding crossing point .",
    "we call this chord diagram the _ gauss diagram _ of @xmath5 and use @xmath24 to denote it , see figure [ figure2 ] for a simple example .",
    "we note that all virtual crossing points are ignored on the gauss diagram .",
    "+    it is well known that each classical knot diagram has a corresponding gauss diagram , but the converse is not true in general .",
    "if we use virtual knot diagrams instead of the classical knot diagrams , then for each gauss diagram we can always find a corresponding virtual knot diagram that represents it .",
    "although there may exist infinitely many different virtual knot diagrams which correspond to the same gauss diagram , we have the following correspondence between them .",
    "a gauss diagram uniquely defines a virtual knot isotopy class .",
    "since the time when virtual knot theory was introduced , many virtual knot invariants have been introduced .",
    "several classical knot invariants can be directly extended to the virtual world .",
    "for example , the knot group , the knot quandle and the jones polynomial can be similarly defined for virtual knots @xcite .",
    "some generalizations of the alexander polynomial for virtual knots can be found in @xcite and @xcite , and some generalizations of the jones polynomial can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "readers should refer to @xcite for some recent progress and open problems in virtual knot theory .      in the present paper we will focus on the virtual knot invariants induced from the chord index .",
    "roughly speaking , a chord index is an integer assigned to each chord in a gauss diagram , or equivalently to each real crossing point of the virtual knot diagram .",
    "we are going to give two definitions of the chord index , one comes from gauss diagrams and the other one comes from knot diagrams .    let @xmath5 be a virtual knot diagram and @xmath24 the corresponding gauss diagram . according to the one to one correspondence between the real crossing points in @xmath5 and chords in @xmath24",
    ", we will use the same notation to denote a real crossing in @xmath5 and its corresponding chord in @xmath24 . choose a chord @xmath25 in @xmath24 ,",
    "we associate four integers to @xmath25 as follows :    1 .   @xmath26 the number of positive chords crossing @xmath25 from left to right ; 2 .",
    "@xmath27 the number of negative chords crossing @xmath25 from left to right ; 3 .",
    "@xmath28 the number of positive chords crossing @xmath25 from right to left ; 4 .",
    "@xmath29 the number of negative chords crossing @xmath25 from right to left .",
    "+    now we define the _ index _ of @xmath25 as    ind@xmath30 .",
    "roughly speaking , the index of a chord @xmath25 counts the signed sum of the chords which have nonempty intersections with @xmath25 .",
    "in other words , each chord that has nonempty intersection with @xmath25 contributes @xmath31 to ind@xmath32 .",
    "now we follow @xcite to give another definition of the chord index from the viewpoint of knot diagrams . before proceeding to give the definition ,",
    "we need to take a quick review of the linking number in virtual knot theory .",
    "let @xmath33 be a 2-component virtual link diagram .",
    "we use over@xmath34 ( under@xmath34 ) to denote the set of crossings between @xmath35 and @xmath36 that we encounter as overcrossings ( undercrossings ) when we travel along @xmath35 .",
    "now we define the _ over linking number _ @xmath37 and the _ under linking number _",
    "@xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the writhe of @xmath25 .",
    "note that if @xmath40 is classical , we always have @xmath41 .",
    "but when @xmath40 has some virtual crossings , this is not true in general .",
    "we turn to the definition of chord index using over linking number and under linking number .",
    "let @xmath5 be a virtual knot diagram and @xmath25 a real crossing point of it .",
    "by smoothing @xmath25 along the orientation of @xmath5 we obtain a 2-component link @xmath33 , where the order of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is indicated in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "the _ index _ of the crossing point @xmath25 can be defined as below    ind@xmath42 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    we end this section with some useful properties of the chord index .",
    "the details of the proof can be found in , for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a virtual knot diagram and @xmath25 a real crossing point of it , then we have the following results :    1 .",
    "the two definitions of the chord index mentioned above are equivalent .",
    "2 .   if @xmath25 is isolated , i.e. no other chord has nonempty intersection with @xmath25 , then ind@xmath43 .",
    "the two crossings involved in @xmath44 have the same index .",
    "the indices of the three crossings involved in @xmath45 are invariant under @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 preserves the indices of chords that do not appear in @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "6 .   if @xmath5 contains no virtual crossings , then every crossing of @xmath5 has index zero .",
    "ind@xmath32 is invariant under switching some other real crossings .",
    "a finite type invariant ( vassiliev invariant ) is a knot invariant which takes values in an abelian group , and it vanishes on all singular knots with @xmath48 singularities if @xmath48 is greater than some fixed integer .",
    "finite type invariant was first introduced by vassiliev in @xcite and later reformulated by birman and lin in a combinatorial way @xcite .",
    "as kauffman did in @xcite , the definition of the finite type invariant can be directly extended to virtual knots . when there is no virtual crossing point , this definition coincides with the combinatorial definition given in @xcite .    before defining the finite type invariants we need to take a quick review of the singular virtual knot theory . by a singular virtual link diagram ,",
    "we mean a 4-valent planar graph with some vertices replaced by real crossings and some vertices replaced by virtual crossings . for the remaining crossings , we call them _",
    "singular crossings_. two singular virtual link diagrams are _ equivalent _ if and only if one can be obtained from the other one by a sequence of generalized reidemeister moves ( figure [ figure1 ] ) and singular reidemeister moves ( figure [ figure5 ] ) .",
    "+    let @xmath49 be a virtual knot invariant which take values in an abelian group .",
    "we extend @xmath49 to an invariant of singular virtual knots with @xmath48 singularities via the following recursive relation    @xmath50 ,    here @xmath51 is obtained from @xmath5 by resolving a singular crossing point into a positive crossing and @xmath52 is obtained from @xmath5 by resolving the same singular crossing point into a negative crossing .",
    "for the initial condition we set @xmath53 .",
    "we say a virtual knot invariant @xmath49 is a _ finite type invariant of degree @xmath48 _ if @xmath54 vanishes on all singular virtual knots with @xmath55 singularities , but there exists a singular virtual knot @xmath5 with @xmath48 singularities such that @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath49 is a finite type invariant of degree @xmath48 , then for any singular virtual knot diagram @xmath5 with @xmath55 singular crossings we have    @xmath57 .",
    "here @xmath58 runs over all @xmath59-tuples of zeros and ones , @xmath60 denotes the number of ones in @xmath58 and @xmath61 is obtained from @xmath5 by replacing the @xmath62-th singular crossing with a positive ( negative ) crossing if the @xmath62-th position of @xmath58 is zero ( one ) .",
    "for example , for classical knots , a finite type invariant of degree 0 means it is preserved under crossing change , hence it takes the same value for all knots .",
    "it is easy to observe that there is no finite type invariant of degree 1 for classical knots .",
    "later we will find that this is not the case for virtual knots .      as before we use @xmath5 to denote a virtual knot diagram and @xmath25 to denote a real crossing of @xmath5 .",
    "proposition 2.3 enlightens us to consider the following integers    @xmath63    where @xmath39 and @xmath64 denote the writhe of @xmath25 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath65 in fact can be determined by other @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "more precisely ,    @xmath68 .",
    "the following theorem can be easily derived from proposition 2.3 .    for each @xmath69",
    ", @xmath70 is a virtual knot invariant .",
    "for convenience , we rewrite these invariants @xmath71 in the form of a polynomial .",
    "we define the _ writhe polynomial _ , which was introduced in @xcite , as    @xmath72 .",
    "obviously @xmath73 is also a virtual knot invariant . if we want to include the contributions from the real crossings with index zero , following @xcite we define the _ affine index polynomial _",
    "@xmath74 to be    @xmath75 .",
    "the writhe polynomial @xmath73 has many applications in virtual knot theory .",
    "first , @xmath76 if @xmath5 is classical , since all crossing points have index zero in this case .",
    "hence whenever @xmath77 , then @xmath5 must be non - classical .",
    "on the other hand , the writhe polynomial is quite sensitive to some symmetries of virtual knots .",
    "for example , consider the virtual trefoil knot in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "direct calculation shows that the writhe polynomial of it is @xmath78 , however the mirror image of it has writhe polynomial @xmath79 .",
    "some examples in @xcite show that writhe polynomial also can be used to distinguish some virtual knots from their inverses .",
    "according to the definition of the chord index , it is evident that @xmath80 @xmath10 gives a lower bound for the number of crossings with index @xmath48 .",
    "however , if a crossing point has index zero , then it has no contribution to the writhe polynomial .",
    "therefore in general we can not obtain any information about the number of crossing points with index zero from the writhe polynomial .",
    "for example , the index of any crossing in a classical knot diagram is zero but the writhe polynomial is also zero .",
    "one approach to overcome this problem was given in @xcite recently . in section 4 we will give an alternative solution to this problem .      in order to discuss finite type invariants of degree 0 , it is convenient to consider the flat virtual knot theory .",
    "flat virtual knot diagram _ is an immersed @xmath0 in the plane , where each crossing is either a virtual crossing point or a flat crossing point .",
    "two flat virtual knot diagrams are _ equivalent _ if they are related by finitely many flat reidemeister moves indicated in figure [ figure1 ] , where all real crossings should be replaced by flat crossings . roughly speaking ,",
    "flat virtual knots are equivalence classes of virtual knots up to crossing changes .",
    "therefore , if a flat virtual knot diagram has no virtual crossing point , then it must be trivial .",
    "given a virtual knot diagram @xmath5 , one can define the corresponding flat virtual knot @xmath81 by replace all real crossings in @xmath5 with flat crossings .",
    "notice that if @xmath5 and @xmath20 can be connected by a sequence of generalized reidemeister moves , then @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be connected by a sequence of corresponding flat reidemeister moves .",
    "this makes a guarantee that the definition of @xmath81 is well defined .",
    "we remark that each flat virtual knot diagram obviously has a corresponding gauss diagram , where each chord in the gauss diagram has no direction or sign .",
    "however for a given gauss diagram , in general it corresponds to infinitely many different flat virtual knot diagrams .",
    "all these flat virtual knots are equivalent if we add one more move in the equivalence relations .",
    "this leads to the _ free knot theory",
    "_ introduced by manturov .",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite and references therein for more details .",
    "recall that a finite type invariant of degree 0 is a nonzero virtual knot invariant which vanishes on all singular virtual knots with one singularity .",
    "according to the recursive relation , it follows that a nonzero virtual knot invariant is a finite type invariant of degree 0 if and only if it is invariant with respect to crossing changes . therefore if we have a nonzero flat virtual knot invariant @xmath3 ( for example , the counting invariant derived from semiquandle introduced in @xcite ) , then by defining @xmath83 we obtain a finite type invariant of degree 0 .",
    "conversely , each finite type invariant of degree 0 also provides us a flat virtual knot invariant .",
    "now we define a flat virtual knot invariant ( hence a finite type invariant of degree 0 ) based on the writhe polynomial @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a virtual knot diagram and @xmath81 the corresponding flat virtual knot .",
    "we define a polynomial of @xmath81 as below    @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is a well defined flat virtual knot invariant .",
    "it suffices to prove that if another virtual knot @xmath20 can be obtained from @xmath5 by some generalized reidemeister moves and crossing changes , then @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath73 is invariant under generalized reidemeister moves , it is sufficient to consider the case that @xmath20 can be obtained from @xmath5 by taking crossing change on a crossing point @xmath25 . without loss of generality , we assume the index of @xmath25 in @xmath5 equals to @xmath87 and the writhe of it is positive .",
    "then after switching @xmath25 this crossing has index @xmath88 and negative sign in @xmath20 .",
    "note that the indices and writhes of all other crossings are preserved .",
    "now we have    @xmath89 .",
    "the proof is finished .",
    "consider the virtual knot @xmath5 and its corresponding flat virtual knot @xmath81 in figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "direct calculation shows that @xmath90 .",
    "hence @xmath91 , which means @xmath81 is a nontrivial flat virtual knot .     and its corresponding flat virtual knot @xmath81,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "let @xmath5 be a virtual knot , if @xmath92 , then the corresponding flat virtual knot @xmath81 is nontrivial .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , several finite type invariants of degree 1 have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite . for the coefficients of the affine index polynomial we have the following result .",
    "for each virtual knot @xmath5 and any @xmath93 , @xmath70 is a finite type invariant of degree 1 .",
    "first we prove that @xmath94 vanishes on each singular virtual knot with 2 singularities .",
    "let @xmath5 be a virtual knot diagram and @xmath95 two real crossing points of @xmath5 .",
    "without loss of generality we assume @xmath96 , ind@xmath97 and ind@xmath98 .",
    "denote the diagram obtained from @xmath5 by switching @xmath99 as @xmath100 .",
    "similarly we can define @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath103 .",
    "then we have    @xmath104 , + @xmath105 , + @xmath106 , + @xmath107 .",
    "it follows that @xmath108 .",
    "now for each @xmath69 it suffices to find a singular virtual knot with one singularity such that @xmath109 is nonzero .",
    "consider a gauss diagram which consists of @xmath110 parallel positive chords ( with the same direction ) and one other positive chord @xmath25 crossing all of them , such that ind@xmath111 . replace the real crossing @xmath25 with a singular crossing we obtain a singular virtual knot @xmath5 .",
    "according to the definition we have    @xmath112 ,    which implies @xmath113 and @xmath114 are nonzero .",
    "there are several different kinds of generalization of the writhe polynomial .",
    "for example , henrich in @xcite defined three virtual knot invariants .",
    "the first one is special case of the writhe polynomial .",
    "the other two invariants , called the smoothing invariant and the gluing invariant , are polynomials of flat virtual knots and singular flat virtual knots respectively .",
    "henrich proved they are all finite type invariant of degree one .",
    "one can simply generalize the writhe polynomial using the idea of smoothing invariant ( see also @xcite ) and gluing invariant .",
    "in @xcite we gave a completely different extension of the writhe polynomial by replacing the chord index with an index function .",
    "it was proved that this generalized invariant is also a finite type invariant of degree one .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for more details .",
    "in @xcite , michael polyak and oleg viro gave a description of finite type invariants of degree two and three by means of gauss diagram representations . by using virtual knots ,",
    "mikhail goussarov @xcite proved that any finite type invariant of classical knots can be described by a gauss diagram formula .",
    "in other words , any finite type invariant of classical knots can be calculated by counting the subdiagrams of the gauss diagram with weights , where the weight of a subdiagram is the product of the writhes of all the chords in the subdiagram . for virtual knots ,",
    "this weight can be strengthened by including the information of chord indices . from this point of view , proposition 3.6 can be reinterpreted as the signed sum of all subdiagrams which consists of only one chord with a fixed nonzero index is a finite type invariant of degree 1 .    it turns out that this idea can be naturally generalized to finite type invariants of higher degrees .",
    "let @xmath24 be a gauss diagram .",
    "for any @xmath115 which satisfies @xmath116 , we define @xmath117 to be the set of all @xmath48-chords @xmath118 in @xmath24 such that ind@xmath119 .    for each virtual knot @xmath5 ,",
    "the integer @xmath120 is a finite type invariant of degree @xmath48 .",
    "note that proposition 3.6 can be recovered from this theorem by taking @xmath121 .",
    "first we show that @xmath122 is a virtual knot invariant . for @xmath123 , since each chord in @xmath118 has nonzero index , therefore each @xmath48-chords in @xmath117 does not contain the chord appears in @xmath123 .",
    "for @xmath44 , let us use @xmath124 to denote the two chords involved in @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath125 if @xmath126 , hence each @xmath48-chords in @xmath117 does not contain both @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "if some @xmath48-chords @xmath118 contains @xmath127 , for example @xmath129 . then the contribution of @xmath130 will be cancelled out by the contribution from @xmath131 . for @xmath45 , since the index and writhe of each chord are both preserved , it follows directly that @xmath132 is invariant under @xmath45 .",
    "now we show that the degree of @xmath132 is less than @xmath55 .",
    "it is sufficient to show that for any singular virtual knot diagram @xmath5 with @xmath55 singular crossings @xmath133 , we have    @xmath134 .",
    "as before here @xmath58 runs through all @xmath59-tuples of zeros and ones , @xmath60 denotes the number of ones in @xmath58 and @xmath61 is obtained from @xmath5 by replacing @xmath135 with a positive ( negative ) crossing if the @xmath62-th position of @xmath58 is zero ( one ) .",
    "fix a @xmath136 , choose a @xmath48-chords @xmath137 of @xmath117 in @xmath138 .",
    "it is possible that some chords may appear both in @xmath133 and @xmath137 . without loss of generality",

    "notice that the index of @xmath141 @xmath142 is invariant under switching @xmath143 @xmath144 .",
    "now fix the first @xmath62 positions of @xmath58 and let the last @xmath145 positions of @xmath58 run over @xmath146 , then the contributions of @xmath137 from these @xmath147 virtual knots will cancel out , because half of them have the positive sign and the other half have the negative sign . repeat this process until the contributions from all @xmath48-chords have been cancelled out , the desired result follows directly .    to complete the proof we need to show that the degree of @xmath132 is exactly @xmath48 .",
    "let us consider the gauss diagram in figure [ figure21 ] , which contains @xmath148 positive chords ( figure [ figure21 ] supposes that @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) .",
