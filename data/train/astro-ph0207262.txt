    "the transition to sqm is expected to occur in nss if sqm has lower energy per baryon than ordinary nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this has strong consequences in the astrophysics of compact stars since , if sqm is the true ground state of strongly interacting matter rather than @xmath3fe , compact objects could be strange stars ( ss ) instead of nss .",
    "some tentative strange star candidates are the compact objects associated with the x - ray bursters gro j1744 - 28 @xcite , sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite , and the x - ray pulsar her x-1 @xcite . in addition , the observed high and low frequency quasi periodic oscillations in the atoll source 4u 1728 - 34 have been shown to be more consistent with a strange star nature @xcite .",
    "a number of different mechanisms has been proposed for nm to sqm conversion @xcite inside the star .",
    "all them are based on the formation of a `` seed '' of sqm inside the ns .",
    "a possible mechanism is the so - called strangelet contamination , where a seed of sqm from the ism enters a ns and converts it to a ss . in another possible scenario , a seed of sqm forms in the core of a ns as a result of the increase of the central density above the critical density for deconfinement phase transition . a way to do",
    "this is through mass accretion onto the ns in a binary stellar system . in a third mechanism ,",
    "a seed of sqm may naturally form inside a newly born neutron star from a core - collapse supernova explosion after a deleptonization timescale @xcite .",
    "no matter which of these mechanisms are actually triggering the ns to ss transition , once the first seed of sqm is produced inside the ns , it will propagate as a combustion swallowing neutrons , protons and hyperons .",
    "the transition to sqm inside the burning front has actually two stages .",
    "deconfinement driven by _",
    "strong _ interactions first liberates quarks confined inside hadrons .",
    "the just deconfined quark phase has a certain finite strangeness due to the presence of strange hadrons in ns matter .",
    "however , the composition of the just deconfined phase ( with u , d and s quarks ) is not in beta equilibrium and consequently chemical equilibrium is reached by _",
    "weak _ interactions .",
    "it is in this phase that a large amount of energy is released and then @xmath4 s are copiously produced .",
    "the type of diffusion - driven combustions studied so far by several authors @xcite actually correspond to laminar deflagrations ( slow combustions ) . whether the conversion process remains forever as a deflagration , either laminar or turbulent ; or jumps to the detonation regime , thus driving",
    "an explosive transient @xcite has been debated in the literature .",
    "the situation is closely analogue to the much more studied thermonuclear combustions leading to type ia supernovae .",
    "in addition to the lack of detailed studies on the mode(s ) of combustion ( laminar / turbulent deflagration or detonation ) , there is ( to the best of our knowledge ) no calculation of the influence of ubiquitous magnetic fields expected to be promptly generated or already present in the ns as a fossil .",
    "we shall consider hereafter an initially laminar deflagration in presence of a @xmath5-field .",
    "as stated , previous works @xcite have calculated the velocity of the laminar deflagration by considering the diffusion of @xmath6-quarks as the main agent for the progress of the conversion . given that the combustion is idealized to happen near the @xmath7 limit ( which is small when compared with the chemical potential of quarks ) , these diffusion - limited `` cold '' models are reasonable for this purpose .",
    "the general result , which also holds when temperature corrections and full non - linearity are considered , is that the laminar velocity of the front is relatively slow ( @xmath8 ) although this speed may be uncertain by several orders of magnitude ( olinto 1991 ) .",
    "this velocity is a direct consequence of both the timescale for weak decays that create @xmath6-quarks ( @xmath9 ) and the physics of the diffusion process .",
    "a nuclear flame that starts as a laminar deflagration propagating outward rapidly enters the wrinkled flamelet regime due to the action of several hydrodynamic instabilities , such as the landau - darrieus ( ld ) and rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) . for the largest scales ( those @xmath10 than the thickness of the flame ) ,",
    "the rt instability dominates over ld ( see ghezzi et al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "it is possible to identify distinct regimes in the deflagration stage , and we will apply the fractal model of combustion @xcite for all those regimes . the wrinkled surface @xmath11 behaves like a fractal with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the fractal dimension of the surface , with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the mean radius of the wrinkled surface @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite and laboratory experiments involving different gas mixtures @xcite show that the fractal growth actually increases the velocity of the combustion front because of the change in the transport mechanism from a laminar to a fully turbulent burning .",
    "the burning of nuclear matter to sqm has been studied so far in the absence of any @xmath5-field .",
    "however , there is an ample consensus that strong magnetic fields should be present at the center , as indicated by the observations of surface pulsar fields ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "even though there is no detailed information on the fields of non - pulsating nss , it seems reasonable to assume a field at least as strong as the one at the surface of radio pulsars _ inside _ the object .    the fractal model presented in ghezzi et al .",
    "2001 for the thermonuclear burning of a white dwarf is applicable to the present case since all the basic ingredients and the key points of the physics are similar . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall assume hereafter a dipolar geometry and thus the flame propagating in two particularly representative directions , one parallel to the b - field lines ( in the polar direction ) and the other one perpendicular to them ( in the equatorial direction ) .",
    "within the fractal description , the effective velocity of the flame is given by @xmath17 where l and @xmath18 are the maximum an minimum length scales of perturbations unstable to rt .",
    "the characteristic velocity of the rt growing modes must be @xmath19 , i. e. @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the inverse of the characteristic rt time . in the absence of a b - field @xmath22 and so @xmath23 .",
    "however , in the equatorial direction , the presence of b is essential in modifying the dispersion relation for the rt instability which reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the wavelength of the perturbation , and @xmath27 is the density difference between the upstream and downstream parts of the flame front @xcite . taking into account the velocity of the flame , the minimum cut - off length is given by the condition @xmath28 , from which we derive the minimum scale in the equatorial direction @xmath29 .",
    "so , from the above definition of the fractal velocity we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "note that l is not modified by b and has the same value in both directions .",
    "then , the ratio between the equatorial and polar velocities is @xcite : @xmath32^{d-2 } .\\ ] ]    that is , although the magnetic pressure @xmath33 is not relevant , the b - field quenches the growth of rt instabilities in the equatorial direction acting as a surface tension , while it is innocuous in the polar one where in average we have @xmath34 .",
    "more specifically b modifies the minimum rt instability scale and since the turbulent flame velocity is related to rt - growth this results in a different velocity of propagation along each direction . since the density of the products of combustion ( sqm ) is comparable to the fuel ( nuclear matter ) @xmath35 ; and using the values for @xmath36 found in previous works @xcite ( @xmath37 ) , we find that @xmath38 for relatively low values of @xmath39 ) , so that for @xmath40 ( which is in good agreement with numerical studies , blinnikov et al .",
    "1995 ) , @xmath41 scales linearly with the field to a good approximation .",
    "so , @xmath42    and large asymmetries can be produced even for moderate values of @xmath5 .",
    "next , we evaluate the time that the polar front needs to reach the surface @xmath43 : @xmath44    note that eq .",
    "( 3 ) gives actually an upper bound to @xmath45 because we have approximated @xmath46 by @xmath36 .",
    "an asymmetry in the @xmath4-emission will be possible only if @xmath47 , that is , if @xmath45 is smaller than the typical diffusion timescale @xmath48 through nuclear matter in the equatorial direction ( @xmath48 is at least @xmath49 , pons et al .",
    "only in this case we can assume that the lateral sides of the cylinder are opaque and almost all the @xmath50 are emitted through the polar caps .",
    "otherwise , we will still have a strong asymmetry in the shape of the sqm region but this will not yield an asymmetry in the @xmath4-emission structure .",
    "the minimum @xmath5 for which @xmath47 is satisfied is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) @xmath51    in other words , for @xmath52 we recover the isotropy of the neutrino emission ( see below ) .",
    "when the polar front reaches the stellar surface , the equatorial front will have travelled only @xmath53 , and therefore the sqm region will begin to emit its neutrino content mainly through a cylinder aligned with the poles with a radius @xmath54 km and a height @xmath55 km ( see fig 1 ) . notice that if @xmath56 , @xmath57 is very small and the total energy released by the sqm conversion is negligible in this asymmetric stage . an estimate for the ratio of the neutrino flux in the equatorial and the polar directions",
    "is found by comparing the flux through the opaque ns matter in the equatorial direction with the free streaming flux of neutrinos emitted from the polar caps , namely @xmath58 \\ ; / \\ ; [ c   \\epsilon_{\\nu } ] \\approx    \\lambda_n / ( 3 \\delta r)\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 is the difference between the radius of the star and the equatorial radius of the sqm core .",
    "@xmath60 is the mean free path of neutrinos diffusing from the surface of the sqm core in the equatorial direction @xcite .",
    "this @xmath61 is mainly due to neutral - current elastic scattering off neutrons . for typical values of @xmath61 and a highly asymmetric sqm region",
    "we have @xmath62 .",
    "thus , once the polar front reaches the surface , almost all @xmath4 s are released through the polar caps .",
    "this is due to the fact that the flux in the equatorial direction is quenched due to the high @xmath63 while @xmath0 s in the polar surface escape freely .",
    "the neutrino transport inside the sqm cylinder can be described by : @xmath64 $ ] , with the boundary conditions @xmath65 , @xmath66 and the initial condition @xmath67 , being @xmath68 the neutrino energy density , @xmath69 the total energy density of sqm , @xmath70 the height of the cylinder , and @xmath71 . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that neutrino transport is driven by electron - neutrino pairs , so that @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "although muon and tau neutrinos are in fact important , this simplification does not essentially modify the picture and allows a simple solution for the problem .",
    "the total internal energy released in the conversion of a whole ns into sqm is @xmath73 ergs @xcite .",
    "so , a rough estimate of the initial temperature of the just formed sqm will be @xmath74 ( in units of @xmath75 ) . from the integration of the equations above we obtain the temperature in the polar cap surface as a function of time @xmath76 , and the corresponding neutrino luminosity @xmath77 ^ 4 ( \\delta / 1 km ) ^2.\\ ] ]    the emitted @xmath0 s annihilate into @xmath1 pairs with rather low efficiencies .",
    "following the procedure of haensel et al .",
    "1991 we have calculated the luminosity in @xmath1 for this cylindrical configuration ( see haensel et al .",
    "1991 for the result in spherical symmetry ) @xmath78 ^ 9 \\ ; ( \\delta / 1 km ) ^2   ( r /10 km ) .",
    "\\label{7}\\ ] ]    these luminosities are shown in fig .",
    "we find that @xmath79 of the @xmath80 pairs are injected inside small cylinders located just above the polar caps ( with radius @xmath57 and height @xmath81 ) in a timescale of @xmath82 almost independently on the initial temperature .",
    "grbs appear to fall into at least two distinct categories , namely the short duration bursts ( @xmath83 0.2 s ) and the long duration ones ( @xmath83 20 s ) ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "previous works have explored the idea that the conversion of nuclear matter into sqm in nss may be an energy source for grbs @xcite .",
    "these models addressed spherically symmetric conversions of the whole ns giving isotropic @xmath2- emission .",
    "we show here that if a conversion to sqm actually begins near the center of a ns , the presence of a _ moderate _ magnetic field @xmath5 ( @xmath84 ) will originate a prompt asymmetric @xmath2-emission which will be observed as a short , beamed grb .",
    "given that all pairs contributing to eq.([7 ] ) will annihilate into @xmath2 s , we are lead to the conclusion that an asymmetric short grb can be generated by this process . the energy injected in @xmath2-rays is @xmath85 erg , comparable to the ones derived for long grbs .",
    "the asymmetry crucial for this conclusion is controlled by the quotient of the field @xmath5 to the laminar velocity @xmath36 ( eq.1 ) .",
    "had the latter been larger by a few orders of magnitude no significant asymmetry would be produced by realistic magnetic fields .",
    "it should be remarked that we have _ not _ shown that the turbulent deflagration will be the actual propagation mode , but rather assumed its realization all the way down to the stellar surface .",
    "actually , a possible transition from a deflagration to a detonation mode ( ddt ) ( in close analogy with the ddt in white dwarf combustions ) , may be achieved @xcite depending on the behavior of the microphysics . however , if a substantial asymmetry has already been produced when the ddt is achieved , the polar flow will detonate before the equatorial one .",
    "basic requirements for associating asymmetric sqm burnings to ( short ) grbs are the absence of a large amount of matter above the polar regions and a rate per galaxy high enough ( @xmath86 ) so as to compensate the collimation of the emission .",
    "it is unclear whether both can be achieved , but in any case it is clear that further studies of the hydrodynamics and statistics of the events are desirable .",
    "however , and quite independently of the specific astrophysical setting , the result of nm to sqm conversion in presence of @xmath87 will produce an asymmetry in the neutrino emission and an enhanced annihilation to @xmath2 s .",
    "however , the observational outcome and the rate of the events will depend on the type of system in which the ns is being burned .",
    "for example , in transitions produced by accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf , the energy is deposited in a region that contains a low baryon loading .",
    "so , this collimated emission has an advantage over the isotropic one , where @xmath88 , in that the total baryon loading `` seen '' by the beamed burst ( @xmath89 of the total ) is low enough to allow for a relativistic expansion of the fireball with very high lorentz factors and is sufficient to explain apparent burst luminosities @xmath90 up to more than @xmath91 ergs / s for burst durations of @xmath92 .",
    "nss in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are also likely candidates for the conversion to sqm because mass accretion may raise the central density of the ns above the critical density for transition .",
    "these nss have `` weak '' magnetic fields in their surface ( b = @xmath93 g ) which are generally understood as the result of mass accretion .",
    "since this affects in principle only the field in the surface , the field in the _ interior _ of the ns would be in the range of values that leads to an asymmetric short grb .",
    "note also that if the emission is beamed it would be difficult to explain the observed rate of grbs by conversions in binary systems alone . for transitions in newly born proto - nss ,",
    "the presence of the supernova envelope makes necessary to explain how the @xmath2-emission produced by the central proto - ns traverses the young expanding ejecta ( one clue may have been provided by grb980425/sn1998bw association ) . in any case",
    ", we may expect emission of quasi - thermal x - ray flashes with rates per galaxy @xmath94 , being @xmath95 the unknown fraction of proto - ns with fields @xmath87 from the events .",
    "other consequences for the ejected envelopes may include asymmetries of the envelope itself due to the non - isotropic injection of energy .",
    "we plan to discuss these issues thoroughly in a future work ."
