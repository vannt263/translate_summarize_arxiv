    "increasing demands for high - density data storage with ultra - fast accessibility present tremendous challenges . in parallel to the characterization of new materials , important size - dependent effects must be understood to optimize design .",
    "this is particularly true for ferroelectric memories , whose nonvolatility and low power consumption make them well - suited for portable applications ;  @xcite their dielectric properties are strongly dependent on electromechanical boundary conditions due to the long - range nature of their underlying electrostatic interactions .",
    "the sensitivity of ferroelectricity to homogeneous strain in bulk perovskite oxides is well - known .",
    "@xcite in thin films , the effects of homogeneous misfit strain have been identified,@xcite studied and controlled to the point that particular systems have been strain - engineered to have spontaneous polarizations significantly larger than those in the bulk .",
    "@xcite despite these impressive achievements , several authors  @xcite have suggested that homogenous epitaxial strain can not qualitatively account for all the observed effects in ferroelectric films . in particular , the thickness - dependence of their dielectric properties has been attributed to defect - induced strain gradients .",
    "@xcite in this paper we explore whether these observed size - effects are also consistent with an alternative scenario where the majority of each ferroelectric film is homogeneously strained .",
    "our phenomenological study indicates that thickness - dependent dielectric measurements are insufficient to determine the presence / absence of underlying inhomogeneous strain and we suggest further benchtop experiments that will resolve this issue .    in well - screened coherent epitaxial ferroelectric thin films , uniform polarization is energetically favored .",
    "lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate is a key source of macroscopic strain in these systems .",
    "@xcite for very thin films , the energy cost for homogeneously straining the film to match the substrate is less than that associated with the introduction of stress - relieving defect structures at the interface .",
    "however in thicker films , such misfit dislocations form and produce strain gradients  @xcite ; threading dislocations and point defects are additional sources of inhomogeneous strain . in planar",
    "ferroelectric films , inhomogeneous strain can affect the ferroelectric transition through both smearing and through its coupling to the polarization .",
    "such flexoelectric coupling of strain gradients to the polarization has been the topic of much recent interest  @xcite particularly as it has been suggested that flexoelectric effects are enhanced by large dielectric coefficients .",
    "@xcite recently it has been argued that such strain / stress gradients are crucial for the modelling of thickness - dependent dielectric properties of ferroelectric films .",
    "@xcite here we propose an alternative model : that the misfit dislocations reside within a thin buffer layer next to the interface ; the majority of the film , which is relatively defect - free , is then homogeneously strained .",
    "@xcite in our phenomenological treatment , we also include a bulk anisotropy  @xcite in the form of an effective field ,  @xcite possibly due to asymmetry of the electrodes and/or to the thin buffer layer .",
    "we model the thickness - dependent dielectric properties in two different types of ferroelectric films , and compare our results with experiment and with first - principles calculations whenever possible .",
    "finally we discuss a benchtop `` smoking gun '' probe to distinguish our segregated strain scenario with that of inhomogeneous strain in ferroelectric thin films .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the experiments that motivate this study and their implications for any descriptive model .",
    "details of our phenomenological landau approach are presented in section iii , with specific discussion of the appropriate boundary conditions and depolarization effects . in section",

    "broadening of the temperature - dependent permittivity in thin films near the paraelectric - ferroelectric transition is reported by several experimental groups ;  @xcite this observed smearing , accompanied by an overall reduction in its magnitude , is more pronounced with decreasing film thickness .",
    "careful measurements on free - standing ferroelectric lamellae yield bulk - type dielectric responses , suggesting interfacial effects as the source of these thickness - dependent effects .",

    "[ pgfig ] we display relative permittivity measurements done on @xmath0 ( bst ) thin films grown on @xmath4 ( sro ) .",
    "@xcite the measurements show suppression of the relative permittivity with decreasing film thickness . as the film thickness decreases to 340 nm , the temperature associated with the maximum of the permittivity ( @xmath3 ) appears to saturate at about 300 k , with @xmath3 for the two thinnest films not being clearly discernable .",
    "as we will discuss in section iv , this is consistent with the prediction of our model that there should be a maximum in @xmath5 at a thickness @xmath6 ; from the data in figure [ pgfig ] we estimate @xmath7 nm in bst films grown on sro . in ferroelectric films ,",
    "in contrast with their bulk counterparts , there is an observed distinction  @xcite between @xmath3 and @xmath8 , the temperature where polarization becomes switchable .",
    "this separation of temperature - scales and the permittivity broadening discussed earlier are both features characteristic of dielectric behavior in an applied bias field  @xcite ; the latter could be due to a real charge distribution or it could result from another physical effect  @xcite that breaks the symmetry @xmath9 .",
    "for example it has been noted  @xcite that flexoelectric coupling , known to increase near a ferroelectric transition ,  @xcite implies a spatially - varying effective field term due to the underlying inhomogeneous strain  @xcite .",

    "therefore in our segregated strain approach , thin films experience homogeneous film strain that decreases exponentially with their overall thickness @xmath12 ; more specifically we model this thickness - dependent in - plane film strain as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a characteristic length - scale of the strain relaxation , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to the in - plane lattice parameters of the film ( bulk value ) and the substrate , respectively  @xcite .",

    "we note that these values of @xmath15 are comparable to the film thicknesses of interest ( @xmath18 ) , resulting in a non - trivial thickness - dependence of the strain - related properties .",

    "the defect buffer layer is also displayed in fig .

    "[ templfig ] .",
    "we note here that although @xmath8 increases , it has negative nonphysical value for these low strain values , and thin films remain in the nonswitchable regime down to zero temperature .",
    "as noted previously , the thickness - dependence of this temperature scale arises from competition between strain and bias field contributions ( see eq .",

    "we begin with a general discussion of the effective bias field in epitaxial perovskite oxide films . both the inhomogeneous ( see fig .",
    "[ catalanstrain2fig ] ) and the segregated ( see fig .  [ homogstrain2fig ] ) strain models describe the thickness - dependent dielectric properties of ferroelectric films consistently with experiment , and thus further measurements are required to determine the presence / absence of underlying inhomogeneous strain throughout the film .",
    "these models each have effective bias fields , one that is spatially varying  @xcite and the other that is uniform , and it is exactly this feature that we exploit in a proposed benchtop experiment to distinguish these two scenarios",
    ".    an effective bias field breaks up - down symmetry at all temperatures . in a film above the zero-(external ) field ( @xmath111 ) ferroelectric transition temperature @xmath8 , this results in a nonzero macroscopic polarization in zero external electric field ( see eq .",
    "[ eqnp ] ) ; for the sake of completeness , we note that the curie temperature @xmath66 refers to the paraelectric - ferroelectric transition at zero total field ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "while this polarization can vary with temperature , making the film pyroelectric , it should not be confused with a ferroelectric spontaneous polarization . the correct distinction between polar and ferroelectric films",
    "is made on the basis of switchability , as determined , for example , through a hysteresis measurement . in a nonswitchable polar film ,",
    "there is only one locally stable polarization state with @xmath111 , and the system will show dielectric behavior in a finite external electric field . on the other hand , if there are two ( or more ) stable polarization states for the system with @xmath111 that can be switched by application of an external electric field , then the film is ferroelectric , and it will exhibit a characteric ferroelectric hysteresis loop .",
    "an effective bias field @xmath38 will lead to a lateral shift in the ferroelectric hysteresis loop , which can be used to determine the associated effective bias voltage across the film .",
    "field offsets have been indeed experimentally observed in @xmath174 nm @xmath211 ( pzt ) thin films .",
    "@xcite we also remark that an effective bias field will make the two polarization states symmetry - inequivalent with different energies .",
    "the transition from nonswitchable to switchable ferroelectric phases usually occurs as a function of decreasing temperature at @xmath8 .",
    "the detailed thickness - dependence of t@xmath212 depends on material - specific parameters , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ templfig ] and  [ tferrolstrainstofig ] for bst and sto thin films .",
    "more generally the @xmath12-dependence of the dielectric properties enters via the strain relaxation ( eq .  [ eqnul ] ) , the bias ( eq",
    ".  [ eqnwl ] ) and the depolarization fields . for the strain relaxation ,",
    "an exponential decay on a characteristic length scale of several hundred nanometers was observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite in our model , we assume the same exponential decay for the magnitude of the uniform effective bias field .",
    "these two quantities determine the thickness - dependence of the quantities of interest in all but the very thinnest films , where the depolarization field term dominates , strongly suppressing @xmath8 , the polarization , and @xmath3 . in the case of the temperature",
    "@xmath8 ( see figs .  [ templfig ] and  [ tferrolstrainstofig ] ) , the strain and effective bias contributions opppose each other ( eq .  [ eqntferro ] ) and depending on their relative strengths , @xmath213 increases ( bst case where @xmath38 dominates ) or decreases ( situation for strained sto where @xmath13 is greater ) with increasing film thickness @xmath12 .",
    "a direct consequence of the strain contribution to @xmath8 is that we predict that ferroelectricity can be strengthened as the films get thinner ( @xmath13 increases with decreasing @xmath12 ) , resulting in a transition from a nonswitchable polar phase to a ferroelectric state below a critical thickness @xmath214 ; more specifically , for sto measured at @xmath174 k and compressive strain @xmath215 ( see fig .",
    "[ tferrolstrainstofig ] ) , the critical thickness below which ferroelectricity appears is @xmath216 nm . this runs counter to the usual notion that ferroelectricity is suppressed as the film thickness decreases , disappearing below a critical thickness ; we note that would be the case for bst on sro ( here @xmath38 dominates the expression for @xmath8 ) where our results displayed in fig .",
    "[ templfig ] indicate a critical thickness of about @xmath174 nm at temperature @xmath139 k. this reentrant ferroelectricity as a function of decreasing @xmath12 should be readily observable in an appropriate experiment for strained sto films with the polarization normal to the film - substrate interface .    both the strain and the effective bias contributions act to decrease @xmath5 and @xmath63 ( related by eq .  [ eqntmax ] ) as a function of increasing film thickness ( @xmath12 ) ( see figs .  [ templfig ] ,  [ pl300aptbstfig ] and  [ pl300tstofig ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the depolarization contribution suppresses @xmath5 and @xmath63 with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "the dominance of this depolarization term explains the observed shift of the peak of @xmath5 to higher values of @xmath128 for semiconducting substrates ( e.g. pss ) ( see fig  [ ertbstptfig ] ) that have longer screening lengths ( @xmath21 ) than their metallic counterparts ( e.g. sro ) ; here we recall that the depolarization contribution to the free energy expansion is @xmath217 ( eq .",
    "[ eqnalphad ] ) .",
    "we note that the thickness - dependent effect of the depolarization field on the relative permittivity has been noted before  @xcite with a similar term , @xmath218 , where boundary conditions for the spatially - varied polarization are proposed that incorporate the effects of a symmetry - breaking effective field . in this previous approach ,",
    "@xcite @xmath16 then is a boundary - related characteristic length . since the thickness - dependence in both treatments is the same , one obtains similar results for the relative permittivity with appropriate choice of these length - scales ( @xmath21 and @xmath16 ) although their physical origins are different .",
    "here we have extended this treatment to address the thickness - dependence of other dielectric properties ( e.g. polarization ) as well , and we note that the previous inhomogeneous strain approach  @xcite did not include such depolarization effects for thin ferroelectric films .

    "the smearing of the sharp peak in the temperature - dependent dielectric response(figs .",
    "[ ertbstfig ] ,  [ ertbstptfig ] and  [ ertlstofig ] ) in zero electrical field ( @xmath111 ) is a signature of the presence of a finite effective bias field @xmath221 ; this point has been much discussed previously both here ( see eqs .  [ eqnchi ] ,  [ eqnp ] ) and by others .",
    "@xcite @xmath38 assumes larger values for thinner films ( see eq .",
    "[ eqnwl ] ) and so pushes the permittivity to smaller values in thinner films ( see eq .",
    "[ eqnchi ] ) , in accordance with experiment ( fig .",
    "[ pgfig ] ) . in the bulk limit ,",
    "both the strain and the bias field vanish and bulk behavior of the dielectric properties is recovered .    while there is general agreement that effective bias fields play an important role in the properties of perovskite thin films ,  @xcite their specific origins and their spatial natures in the films",
    "are less well understood .",
    "for example , an effective bias field can be produced by a spatially ( z)-dependent strain via a flexoelectric effect ;  @xcite we will refer to this as the inhomogeneous strain model and it is schematically depicted in fig .  [ catalanstrain2fig ] . in this scenario ,",
    "misfit dislocations are distributed roughly isotropically throughout the film and produce strain gradients . by contrast , in the segregated strain model presented here , the elastic defects are concentrated in a thin buffer layer near the film - substrate interface ( see fig .",
    "[ filmfig ] and fig .",
    "[ homogstrain2fig ] ) .",
    "this buffer layer itself breaks the up - down symmetry of the film , which then results in a nonzero effective field . to be more specific",
    ", it may be that an edge dislocation in the buffer layer produces a local polar distortion .",
    "this makes the buffer layer polar and produces a field in the uniform film .",
    "we then expect the strength of the effective bias field to be related to the areal density of dislocations , and thus to the magnitude of the homogeneous strain in the film .    as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ bstsec ] , using the segregated strain model ( see figs  [ filmfig ] and  [ homogstrain2fig ] ) we recover the thickness - dependent dielectric properties of bst films consistent with those measured  @xcite and calculated using flexoelectric effects  @xcite within an inhomogeneous strain scenario ( see fig  [ catalanstrain2fig ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to determine which of these two models is applicable to a particular film , additional experimental characterization is necessary .",
    "the presence of strain gradients in the bst films studied using flexoelectricity  @xcite was verified by x - ray analyses  @xcite , though similar studies on different bst films ( on different substrates ) indicate the absence of such inhomogeneous strain .",
    "@xcite therefore it is clear that observations of thickness - dependent permittivities and polarizations are not enough to indicate the underlying strain profile of the ferroelectric film .",
    "naturally the presence / absence of strain gradients can be addressed directly by x - ray diffraction but this probe may not be always easily accessible or practical .",
    "here we emphasize that the effective bias fields associated with these two strain models are spatially different ( see figs  [ catalanstrain2fig ] and  [ homogstrain2fig ] ) , and we will use this distinction to propose a benchtop experiment to distinguish between these two scenarios . in the inhomogeneous strain model ,  @xcite the effective bias field is spatially nonuniform ; more specifically is proportional to the strain gradient via a flexoelectric coupling , and thus has an exponentially decaying spatial profile within the film ( see fig  [ catalanstrain2fig ] ) .",
    "by contrast , in the segregated strain model ( see fig  [ homogstrain2fig ] ) , the effective bias field is uniform from the edge of the buffer layer to the surface . assuming that this effective bias field @xmath38 is uniform in the majority of the film",
    ", one can tune an external electric field to the right value , @xmath222 , to create a net zero - field condition ( @xmath223 ) where the specific value of the necessary external field would be thickness - dependent .",
    "therefore there would exist an external field value @xmath224 when the hysteresis loop would no longer have a field offset ; at this value of the applied external field , a sharp peak in the temperature - dependence of the relative permittivity should be observed ( fig  [ hysteresis3fig ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that this must be a unipolar hysteresis experiment , with single top and bottom electrodes ; many measurements are performed across two top electrodes , namely two series capacitors , where one would always be uncompensated .",
    "another probe of the spatial uniformity of @xmath221 would be to measure t@xmath212 as a function of @xmath35 ; for a uniform effective bias field there would be a sharp peak in t@xmath212 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tferrodbstfig ] .",
    "this pronounced peak would not be present for a spatially - varying effective bias field @xmath225 since the latter would have varying magnitude in the sample and no particular value of applied ( uniform ) @xmath35 could completely compensate for it everywhere in the film ; physically we note that @xmath225 could arise from coupling of the polarization to gradients in the strain ,  @xcite in chemical composition , and in temperature .",
    "@xcite there do exist graded ferroelectric structures where such spatially varying quantities are explicitly present by design ; here a charge offset is often observed in the charge - voltage hysteresis loops ,  @xcite and this could serve as an indicator of underlying gradients in ferroelectric films if a suitable `` charge origin '' could be chosen as a reference .",
    "we emphasize that we expect different films , with varying compositions , substrates and growth conditions , to have diverse strain and effective bias field profiles .",
    "the inhomogeneous scenario may describe some while others may be better modelled by the segregated strain approach ; still others may exhibit intermediate behavior . by carefully monitoring growth conditions",
    ", it should be possible to control the density and spatial distribution of strain - relieving defects ; in some case , it may even be feasible to kinetically inhibit them to obtain uniform coherently - strained films .",
    "@xcite we emphasize that in each case , the strain and effective bias field distributions must be carefully characterized for a full interpretation of the measured thickness - dependent dielectric behavior , and we have presented simple proposals for benchtop measurements to ascertain the importance of strain gradients in the films .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that a segregated strain model ( cf .",
    "fig  [ filmfig ] ) describes the observed thickness - dependent dielectric properties of ferroelectric films as well as does a previous model of inhomogeneous strain .",
    "@xcite therefore such thickness - dependent behavior is not signatory of underlying strain gradients , and more measurements must be performed to determine the strain profile in the film .",
    "if the effective bias field is spatially uniform , it can be compensated by the application of an applied external electric field @xmath226 whose value will be dependent on the overall film thickness @xmath12 .",
    "benchtop experiments performed with @xmath227 will yield bulk - like sharp dielectric responses .",
    "however such compensation will not be possible if the effective bias field is spatially varying , since then its effects can not be cancelled by the application of an external uniform field .",
    "we have compared our results with experiment ( bst on sro ) whenever possible and have also made predictions for measurements on strained sto films with out - of - plane polarization .",
    "agreement with existing ab - initio calculations , when appropriate , has been good .",
    "the possibility of reentrant ferreoelectricity in strained sto films has also been discussed and we hope that this will be explored experimentally in the near future .",
    "our phenomenological study of planar films suggests that their thickness - dependent dielectric properties are not indicative of underlying inhomogeneous strain , and are consistent with other strain profiles .",
    "we view this project as the beginning of a broader study of the physical consequences of boundary - induced effects in ferroelectrics of increasingly complex host topologies .",
    "a next step is to explore cases where the strain gradients will be induced by geometry : examples include curved films and cylindrical shells . because of the coupling between the elastic and the electrical degrees of freedom in these systems , we expect tunable strain gradients to stabilize novel polarization configurations with rich phase behavior , and here flexoelectric effects",
    "should definitely be investigated .",
    "more complex host geometries and boundary conditions are expected to favor more novel orderings and dielectric properties ; the possibility of identifying and characterizing these features in three - dimensional ferroelectrics on the nanoscale could also be useful in the design of future ferroelectric memories .",
