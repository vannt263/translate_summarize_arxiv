    "in this paper we study neutron stars of two types .",
    "first , they are _ cooling isolated middle - aged _ ( @xmath0 yr ) neutron stars which are born hot in supernova explosions but gradually cool down mostly via neutrino emission from their superdense cores .",
    "they are mainly thermally relaxed and isothermal inside .",
    "a noticeable temperature gradient still persists only in their thin heat blanketing envelopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , we study old ( @xmath1 yr ) _ transiently accreting quasi - stationary neutron stars in low - mass x - binaries _ ( lmxbs ) ; such transient systems are called x - ray transients ( xrts ) .",
    "these neutron stars accrete matter from time to time ( in the active states of xrts ) from their low - mass companions .",
    "the accreted matter is compressed under the weight of newly accreted material and the compression is accompanied by deep crustal heating @xcite due to beta - captures , neutron absorption and emission , and pycnonuclear reactions with characteristic energy release of 12 mev per accreted nucleon deeply in the crust .",
    "the accretion episodes are supposed to be neither too long ( months weeks ) nor too intense to overheat the crust and destroy the internal equilibrium between the crust and the core .",
    "nevertheless , the deep crustal heating should be sufficiently strong to keep the neutron stars warm and explain observable thermal emission of such neutron stars during quiescent states of xrts @xcite .",
    "the mean neutron star heating rate is determined by the average mass accretion rate @xmath2 ; the averaging has to be performed over characteristic cooling times of such stars ( typically @xmath3 yr ) .",
    "the isolated cooling neutron stars are usually studied by calculating their _ theoretical cooling curves _ ( time dependence of their effective surface temperature @xmath4 or ( equivalently ) thermal surface luminosity @xmath5 , redshifted or non - redshifted for a distant observer ) .",
    "the curves are calculated under different assumptions on the neutrino emission in the stellar core , and then they are compared with observations ( to reach the best agreement ) .",
    "the transiently accreting neutron stars in xrts are investigated by simulating their _ theoretical heating curves _ , which give average @xmath6 or @xmath7 for accreting neutron stars in quiescent states as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the heating curves are also compared with observations .",
    "it is important that the cooling and heating curves have much in common ( e.g. , @xcite ) and allow one to study fundamental physics of neutron stars . as a rule , one plots the cooling and heating curves to interpret observations of individual stars .",
    "the most important cooling / heating regulators to be tested are as follows .    1 .   a level of neutrino luminosity of the star . specifically , it is the neutrino cooling rate @xmath8 for a cooling neutron star or neutrino luminosity @xmath9 for a transiently accreting star ( @xmath10 being the heat capacity of the star ) .",
    "2 .   stellar mass and equation of state ( eos ) of superdense matter in the stellar core which regulate the level of the neutrino emission in the core .",
    "composition of the heat blanketing envelope of a cooling or heating star which determines the relation between the internal and surface temperature of the star .    since observations of isolated and transiently accreting neutron stars are rapidly progressing , it is instructive to utilize the accumulated statistics of the sources and develop a statistical theory of their evolution",
    ". it is the aim of this paper to put forward such a theory .",
    "it will take into account that the cooling and heating curves can strongly depend on neutron star masses .",
    "then , one can introduce the probability to find a source in different places of the cooling / heating diagram by averaging these curves over mass distributions of isolated or accreting stars .",
    "naturally , these mass distributions can be different .",
    "comparing theoretical and observational distributions of the sources one can study not only individual cooling regulators mentioned above but also the mass distributions of neutron stars of different types",
    ". the problem would be to find out which physical models of neutron stars and mass distributions of isolated _ and _ accreting neutron stars give the best agreement of calculated and observed distributions of such stars on the cooling _ and _ heating diagrams .",

    "table [ tab : cool ] gives the data on 19 isolated middle - aged neutron stars whose thermal surface radiation has been detected or constrained .",
    "the table gives the source number , source name , estimated age , the effective surface temperature @xmath11 ( redshifted for a distant observer ) as inferred from observations , the confidence level of @xmath11 , a model which has been used to infer @xmath11 , and references to original publications from which the results are taken .",
    "the data have been collected in the same way as in @xcite and @xcite but supplemented by new results .",
    "the data contain neutron stars in supernova remnants ( like the crab pulsar ) , the famous vela pulsar and its twin psr 170644 , compact stellar objects in supernova remnants ( like neutron star in cas a ) , the `` dim '' ( `` truly '' isolated ) stars ( e.g. , rx j1865.43754 ) , etc .",
    "the distances are not very certain even if parallaxes are measured ( see a discussion on rx j1865.43754 in @xcite ) . in many cases the ages are uncertain as well .",
    "the presented values of @xmath11 refer to thermal emission from the entire surface of the stars .",
    "these temperatures are inferred from the observed spectra using blackbody ( bb ) model for thermal emission , the models of nonmagnetic and magnetic hydrogen atmospheres ( ha and mha , respectively ) , the models of hydrogen atmospheres of finite depth , ha@xmath12 and mha@xmath12 , as well as the carbon atmosphere ( ca ) models ( as reviewed , e.g. , by @xcite ) .",

    "extracting @xmath14 and @xmath13 from observations is a very complicated problem as discussed in many references cited in table [ tab : heat ] .",
    "both quantities are often constrained ( given as upper limits ) rather than measured . if measured , their values are rather uncertain ( the error bars are large and difficult to estimate , often not presented ) .",
    "therefore , one should be careful in dealing with these data .",
    "the statistical approach we describe here seems most suitable for this situation .",

    "the authors denoted this eos as hhj ; it belongs to the family of parameterized eoss suggested by @xcite .",

    "the first is the maximum mass model , with @xmath20 ( to be consistent with recent measurements of masses @xmath21 of two neutron stars by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the circumferencial radius of the most massive stable star in this case is @xmath22  km and the central density @xmath23  g  @xmath19 .",
    "the second model in table [ tab : models ] is the model with @xmath24 . at lower @xmath15 the powerful direct urca process of neutrino emission @xcite",
    "is forbidden in a neutron star core , while at higher @xmath15 it is allowed in the central kernel of a star ( at densities @xmath25  g  @xmath19 ) .",
    "such high - mass stars undergo very rapid neutrino cooling .",
    "we calculate thermal evolution of cooling and heating neutron star models using our generally relativistic cooling code @xcite on a dense grid of masses @xmath15 , from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the cooling curves of isolated neutron stars are obtained by directly running the code ( although we are most interested in the ages from @xmath28 to @xmath29 yr at which the stars are isothermal inside and cool via neutrino emission so that the cooling problem is considerably simplified ) .",
    "the heating curves of transiently accreting neutron stars are calculated as stationary solutions of the heat balance equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the averaged deep crustal heating power ( redshifted for a distant observer and determined by the time - averaged mass accretion rate @xmath2 ) .",
    "the interior of the star is assumed to be isothermal ( with general relativistic effects properly included ) while the internal temperature is related to the effective surface one by corresponding heat blanketing solution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "calculated cooling curves will be plotted on the @xmath32 diagram , while heating curves will be plotted on the @xmath33 diagram .",
    "these will be ordinary cooling and heating curves which have been extensively studied by the theory . as a rule",

    "indeed , this theory can in principle explain any cooling or heating curve in the space between the upper ( @xmath43 ) and lower ( @xmath27 ) curves , but the explanation might be unlikely .",
    "for instance , all cooling curves of stars with @xmath44 in fig .  [ fig : theorcoolna ] merge actually into single ( basic ) cooling curve which describes cooling of non - superfluid neutron stars via the modified urca process of neutrino emission ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , at @xmath45 the power direct urca process appears in an inner kernel of the star , the star cools much faster , and becomes much colder than the stars with @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we have actually two types of cooling stars  slowly cooling ( @xmath44 , `` warm '' ) and rapidly cooling ( @xmath46 , `` cold '' ) ones separated by a `` gap '' ; intermediate coolers are available but rather improbable .",
    "equivalently , we have two types of heating neutron stars ( fig .  [",
    "fig : theorheatna ] )  sufficiently warm ( @xmath44 ) and much colder ( @xmath46 ) ones ; intermediate stars are again rather improbable ( the latter circumstance is evident but is not widely known in the literature ) .",
    "the presence of light elements in the heat blanketing envelope ( i.e. accreted envelopes instead of pure iron ) somewhat reduce the `` gap '' and smooths the transition between `` cold '' and `` warm '' stars . but as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : theorcoola ] and [ fig : theorheata ] , the presence of accreted matter can not actually merge two populations and fill in the `` gap '' .",
    "the existence of these two representative types of cooling and heating neutron stars separated by a small amount of intermediate sources formally contradicts the observations ( sect .",
    "[ s : observa ] , figs .",
    "[ fig : cool ] and [ fig : heat ] ) . we will show that it is actually not so .",
    "now we are ready to formulate statistical theory of the thermal evolution of neutron stars .",
    "the stars in question are assumed to have the same internal structure ( eos , neutrino emission properties ) but they can naturally have different parameters such as mass , the amount of light elements in heat - blanketing envelopes , magnetic fields , rotation , etc .",
    "in this situation instead of deterministic cooling / heating curves in appropriate diagrams we can introduce probabilistic ( statistical ) description , and discuss the probability distributions to find a star in different places of a diagram .",
    "these distributions can be obtained by averaging the cooling / heating curves over statistical distributions of probabilistic parameters such as masses @xmath15 and the amount of light elements in heat - blanketing envelopes .",
    "after this averaging , the cooling / heating , that initially followed specific trajectories , is replaced by statistical probabilities to find neutron stars at different stages of their evolution .",
    "in order to illustrate this scheme we simplify our consideration .",
    "first , we neglect the effects of magnetic fields and rotation on thermal states of cooling neutron stars and transiently accreting neutron stars in xrts .",
    "this seems to be a reasonably valid first approximation . to study isolated cooling neutron stars and transiently accreting neutron stars we introduce the distribution functions over neutron star masses for these sources , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these functions are naturally different ; the masses of accreting neutron stars should be overall higher than those of isolated neutron stars .",
    "these distribution functions are taken in the form ( fig .",

    "are artificially set to zero .",
    "note that for the normal distribution function @xmath55 , the parameter @xmath56 is the most probable mass .",

    "it seems these functions do not contradict the data and theoretical expectations ( e.g. , @xcite ) but they are definitely not unique .",
    "it is important that accreting neutron stars are overall heavier as a natural result of accretion .",

    "scaledwidth=51.0% ]    the heat transparency of the blanketing envelope is determined by the mass @xmath64 of light elements ( mainly , hydrogen and helium ) in these envelopes .",
    "the higher @xmath64 , the larger thermal conductivity in the envelope , and the higher @xmath65 for a given internal temperature of the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath64 can not be larger than @xmath66 because at formally larger @xmath64 the light elements at the bottom of the heat blanketing envelope transform into heavier ones due to beta captures and pycnonuclear reactions",
    ". we will consider @xmath67 as a random quantity which is characterized by a distribution function @xmath68 . by way of illustration , in calculations",
    "we take @xmath69 the @xmath70 distribution is highly uncertain ; we take ( [ e : f - deltam ] ) to show the range of effects such distributions can produce .",
    "our cooling code @xcite allows us to take into account the effects of superfluidity on thermal evolution of neutron stars . to reduce the number of variable parameters , we employ a semiphenomenological approach ( although we mention some effects of superfluidity in section [ s : broadurca ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will broad out artificially a step - like density dependence of the neutrino emissivity @xmath71 provided by the direct urca process @xcite . in the absence of superfluidity the direct urca process switches on sharply with increasing density , from @xmath72 at @xmath73 to finite @xmath71 at @xmath74 ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : broadfunc ] ) .",
    "moreover , in our model hhj eos , superdense matter of neutron star cores consists of neutrons with admixture of protons , electrons and muons , and we have direct urca processes of two types , electronic and muonic ones ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , we have two density thresholds for the onset of the electronic and muonic processes ( and the emissivity of both processes  if open  is the same ) .",
    "the density threshold for the muonic process is always higher than for the electronic one .",
    "accordingly , when we increase @xmath15 ( or @xmath17 ) the electronic direct urca always switches on first , sharply ( by 67 orders of magnitude ) increases the neutrino luminosity of the star , and appears to be the leading one .",
    "the switch - on of the muonic process with further increase of @xmath15 or @xmath17 is relatively unimportant ( although included properly in the calculations ) .",
    "it is well known ( see below ) that a sharp step - like onset of the direct urca process is incompatible with observations .",
    "one needs to broaden the direct urca threshold .",
    "we will include this broadening on a phenomenological level by multiplying the electronic and muonic neutrino emissivities by a broadening factor @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , for the electronic direct urca we take ( fig .  [",
    "fig : broadfunc ] ) @xmath76 , \\label{e : broadd}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the threshold emissivity , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , erf(@xmath80 ) is the standard error function , so that @xmath81 at @xmath82 and @xmath83 at @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is a parameter assumed to be small , @xmath86 ( see fig.[fig : broadfunc ] ) .",
    "this parameter determines a narrow range of densities @xmath87 in which the direct urca process gains its strength .",
    "similar broadening is introduced for the muonic direct urca process but it does not affect significantly our results .     versus @xmath88 , eq .  , which approximates broadening of the electronic direct urca threshold @xmath89 for three values of @xmath90 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "the solid line ( @xmath91 ) corresponds to no broadening at all ( see text for details).,scaledwidth=51.0% ]    for example , the broadening of the direct urca threshold can be provided by proton superfluidity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this superfluidity ( due to singlet - state pairing of protons ) is characterized by the proton critical temperature @xmath92 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the critical temperatures are very model dependent , with a large scatter of theoretical @xmath92 , so that it is instructive to not to rely on specific theoretical models but to consider @xmath92 on phenomenological level .",
    "one can expect that proton superfluidity is strong in the outer core of the neutron star ( with @xmath93  k ) but becomes weaker or disappears entirely in the inner core , at a few nuclear matter densities .",
    "as long as it is strong , it greatly suppresses the direct urca process ( even if the direct urca is formally allowed ) by the presence of a large gap in the energy spectrum of protons .",
    "when proton superfluidity becomes weaker with growing @xmath88 , the superfluid suppression is removed and the direct urca becomes very powerful .",
    "it switches on after exceeding some threshold density , but not very sharply , as if the threshold is broadened .",
    "in addition to the nucleonic direct urca process , there could be weaker processes of fast neutrino emission produced , for instance , by the presence of pion or kaon condensates in inner cores of neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these processes are known to be important if the direct urca process itself is forbidden or greatly suppressed .",
    "we will consider such situations in an approximate manner by multiplying the emissivity due to the direct urca process by a factor @xmath94 , where @xmath95 or @xmath96 imitate the presence of pion or kaon condensations , respectively .",
    "all elements of cooling / heating theory of neutron stars employed in our calculations are not new .",

    "these facts indicate that @xmath100 provides insufficient broadening of the direct urca threshold .",

    "fig : coolcr_100 ] and [ fig : heatcr_100 ] ) .",
    "this case is qualitatively similar to the case of open direct urca process ( section [ s : broadurca ] ) . without broadening the threshold @xmath89 of the enhanced neutrino emission we would have two distinct populations of rather warm ( @xmath101 ) and cold ( @xmath45 ) neutron stars separated by a wide `` gap '' ( in disagreement with the observations ) .",
    "however , the gap would be narrower than in section [ s : broadurca ] and colder stars would be warmer . averaging over the distribution of masses of light elements in the heat blanketing envelope",
    "somewhat broadens both populations but the effect is again rather insignificant .",
    "if we introduce some broadening of the threshold for the enhanced emission , the two populations of stars will merge into one population .",
    "however , it is most important that now the transiently accreting massive neutron stars would be warmer and we would never be able to explain the existence of the ultracold neutron star in sax 1808.43658 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : heatcr_100 ] ) .",
    "this star can be explained _ only if _ the direct urca process operates in a massive neutron star .",
    "considering only the isolated cooling neutron stars ( and disregarding the transiently accreting ones ) we would be able to explain all the sources by setting appropriate value for @xmath85 .",
    "finally , let us assume a weakly enhanced neutrino emission with @xmath111 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : coolcr_10000 ] and [ fig : heatcr_10000 ] ) .",
    "if we take the heat blanketing envelopes made of iron and do not broaden the threshold of the enhanced neutrino emission , we would again obtain two distinct populations of rather warm ( @xmath112 ) and less warm ( @xmath45 ) neutron stars separated by a `` gap . ''",
    "if , however , we introduce the averaging over masses of light elements in the heat blanketing envelopes , the two populations will merge into a single one ( almost no broadening of the threshold for the enhanced neutrino emission is required ! ) .",
    "then we would be able to explain the data on isolated cooling neutron stars .",
    "however , we would be unable to interpret the observations of xrts , especially the coldest source sax 1808.43658 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : coolcr_10000 ] and [ fig : heatcr_10000 ] ) .",
    "therefore , our models of neutron stars whose neutrino cooling is less enhanced than the direct urca process can ( in principle ) explain the data on isolated neutron stars but can not explain the data on quasi - stationary neutron stars in xrts .    , but the enhanced neutrino emissivity is multiplied by a factor of @xmath113 .",

    "the two populations of stars merge , but the coldest sources ( and some warmer ones too ) contradict this model.,scaledwidth=51.0% ]",
    "we have proposed a statistical theory of thermal evolution of cooling isolated middle - aged neutron stars and old transiently accreting quasi - stationary neutron stars in xrts .",
    "the theory is based on the standard theory of neutron star cooling and heating added by important elements of statistical theory such as mass distributions of isolated and accreting neutron stars and mass distributions of light elements in heat blanketing envelopes of these stars . instead of traditional cooling and heating curves",
    "we introduce the probability to find cooling and heating neutron stars in different parts of @xmath32 and @xmath114 diagrams , respectively .",
    "these probabilities have been compared with observations of neutron stars of both types .",
    "we have considered the simplest version of the statistical theory .",
    "we have taken one eos of nucleon matter in the neutron star core ( @xmath20 ) where the powerful direct urca process is switched on at @xmath115 g  @xmath19 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "we have introduced phenomenologically the broadening of the direct urca threshold , distribution functions over neutron star masses ( different for isolated and transiently accreting neutron stars ) and calculated the required probabilities .",
    "we have varied the broadening of the direct urca threshold [ the parameter @xmath85 in equation ( [ e : broadd ] ) ] , and typical mass ranges of isolated and accreting neutron stars . in this way we have obtained a reasonable agreement with observations of isolated and accreted neutron stars for @xmath102 , @xmath59 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath117 .",
    "this explanation of _ all the data _ essentially requires ( i ) the presence of the direct urca process in the inner cores of massive neutron stars ( to interpret the observations of sax 1808.43658 ) ; ( ii ) quite definite broadening of the direct urca threshold ( @xmath118 ) to merge the populations of warm ( @xmath44 ) and colder ( @xmath45 ) stars of each type into one ( observable ) population ; and ( iii ) higher typical masses of accreting stars ( to explain the very cold accreting source sax 1808.43658 and the absence of very cold middle - aged isolated neutron stars ) . in this scenario",
    "the averaging over the masses of light elements in the heat blanketing envelopes plays relatively minor role but is helpful to explain the existence of warmer isolated and accreting sources .",
    "nevertheless , these sources can be explained by assuming the presence of strong proton superfluidity in stars with @xmath119 .",
    "this superfluidity suppresses the modified urca process , which is the major process of neutrino emission in low - mass stars .",
    "such stars will become slower neutrino coolers , and hence warmer sources ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the required broading of the direct urca threshold can also be produced by weakening of proton superfluidity in the massive stars ( section [ s : broadurca ] ) .",
    "therefore , the obtained explanation , in physical terms , can be reached by assuming the presence of proton superfluidity in neutron star cores .",
    "this superfluidity should be strong in low - mass stars but weaken in high - mass ones whose neutrino emission is greatly enhanced by the direct urca process .",
    "the present scenario is different from the minimal cooling model @xcite .",
    "the latter model assumes that the enhanced neutrino cooling is produced by the neutrino emission due to the triplet - state pairing of neutrons .",
    "this enhancement is much weaker than that due to the direct urca process ; it can not explain the observations of sax 1808.43658 .",
    "on the other hand , recent analysis of the observations of the neutron star in the cassiopeia a ( cas a ) supernova remnant by @xcite and @xcite indicated that this neutron star has carbon atmosphere , is sufficiently warm but shows rather rapid cooling in real time ( with the surface temperature drop by a few percent in about 10 years of observations ) .",
    "these results have been explained @xcite within the minimum cooling model , by a neutrino outburst within the star due to moderately strong triplet - state pairing of neutrons .",
    "however , the presence of real - time cooling has been put into question by @xcite who attribute it to the chandra acis - s detector degradation in soft channels . a detailed analysis of the cas",
    "a surface temperature decline has been done recently by @xcite by comparing the results from all the _ chandra _ detectors with the main conclusion that the real time cooling is available although somewhat weaker than obtained before .",
    "thus the problem of real time cooling of the cas a neutron star remains open .",
    "if it is available it can not be explained by the scenario suggested in this paper .",
    "let us mention other results of this paper which seem original .",
    "first , we have shown that if the direct urca threshold is not broadened , there are two different populations of accreting neutron stars , warmer and colder ones , separated by a large `` gap . ''",
    "second , we have obtained that if the neutrino emission in massive stars is enhanced only slightly ( @xmath120 , section [ s : pion - kaon ] ) , then the averaging over different amounts of light elements in the heat blanketing envelopes merges the populations of warmer and colder ( isolated and accreting ) stars into one population even without broadening the threshold of the enhanced neutrino emission .    there is no doubt that the statistical theory presented above can be elaborated further .",
    "for instance , we have used only one eos of superdense matter in neutron star cores , while one can try many other ones .",
    "however , it is possible to predict that the results will be similar , rescaled with respect to the values of @xmath121 for new eoss .",
    "one can also try different mass distributions of isolated and accreting neutron stars .",
    "in addition , one can expect that the distribution of light elements in the heat blanketing envelopes is not entirely arbitrary but is regulated by diffusion processes in the envelopes .",
    "another issue for future studies would be to include the effects of rotation and magnetic fields , and also numerous effects of nucleon superfluidity ( see , e.g. , fig.[fig : coold_10 ] ) .",
    "note that statistical studies of populations of cooling neutron stars have been performed in several publications ( e.g. , @xcite ) but under quite different approaches and with different conclusions .",
