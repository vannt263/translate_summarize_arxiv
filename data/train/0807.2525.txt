    "galaxy clusters have been one of the most important probes of cosmology ( e.g. , bartlett & silk 1994 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; kitayama & suto 1996 , 1997 ; kitayama , sasaki , & suto 1998 ; holder et al . 2000 ; haiman , mohr , & holder 2001 ; majumdar & mohr 2004 ) . in the context of dark energy surveys , which attracts much of the attention of the cosmology and particle physics communities ,",
    "galaxy cluster surveys are also unique in that they most directly probe the growth of structure rather than relying solely on distance measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to capitalize on this , galaxy cluster surveys , in particular those utilizing the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( for reviews see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are currently operating and many more are planned in the near future .",
    "however , one of the biggest challenges in interpreting these surveys is relating physical quantities of galaxy clusters , namely mass , to observable ones .",
    "in particular , these mass - observable relations may be sensitive to the inherent complex structure of clusters .",
    "therefore we must better understand galaxy clusters to utilize fully the potential of galaxy cluster surveys in constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "recent observations of galaxy clusters have revealed a rich variety of structural complexity .",
    "recent x - ray satellites with their improved angular resolution , collecting area , and simultaneous spectral measurement capabilities have unveiled complex temperature structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shock fronts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cold fronts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and x - ray holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". improved observational strategies and analysis methods of lensing observations of galaxy clusters show that the mass distribution , as opposed to just the gas , is often complicated as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . both x - ray and lensing observations of galaxy clusters",
    "reveal that clusters are frequently undergoing mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with such various and sundry structural complexities may galaxy clusters reliably be used as cosmological probes ?",
    "the complex structure seen in galaxy clusters motivates our investigation of the intracluster medium ( icm ) inhomogeneity .",
    "we note , however , that we take a statistical approach to modeling the inhomogeneity rather than directly modeling such complex phenomena as shocks , cold fronts , etc .",
    "motivated by results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we explore the ramifications of a lognormal model of the inhomogeneity of the icm .",
    "this model was first proposed ( kawahara et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter paper i ; kawahara et al .  2008 ) , in this context , to explain the discrepancies between emission weighted and spectroscopic temperature estimates from galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "they found that local inhomogeneities of the icm play an essential role in producing the systematic bias between spectroscopic and emission weighted temperatures .",
    "thus far , the lognormal model has been motivated by and applied only to clusters from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "therefore it is crucial to see if inhomogeneities in real galaxy clusters also show the lognormal signature . in reality",
    ", this is not a straightforward task since one can observe clusters in x - rays only through their projection over the line of sight .",
    "thus we develop a method of extracting statistical information of the three - dimensional properties of fluctuations from the two - dimensional x - ray surface brightness .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first summarize the log - normal model in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we create synthetic clusters to explore the relationship between the intrinsic cluster inhomogeneity and x - ray observables in  [ sec : synthetic ] . in  [ sec : obs ] we apply our methodology to _ chandra _  observations of the galaxy cluster abell 3667 , and then attempt to quantify the nature of cluster inhomogeneity .",
    "we also compare our synthetic cluster results with cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in  [ sec : con ] . finally , we summarize our results in  [ sec : sum ] . throughout the paper",
    "the hubble constant is parameterized by @xmath1 in the usual way , @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "in order to characterize the inhomogeneity of the icm , we define the density and temperature fluctuations as the ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the local density and temperature at radius @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the angular average profiles defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are polar and azimuthal angles , respectively .",

    ", we also need the properties of the power spectra of the density and temperature fluctuations .",
    "we adopt statistically isotropic fluctuations with a power - law type power spectrum for both the density fluctuations @xmath22 and the temperature fluctuations @xmath23 .",
    "these assumptions are based on the results of the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations described in ",
    "[ subsec : hydro_sim ] .",
    "we use this model to generate synthetic clusters to explore the relationship between the three - dimensional inhomogeneity in the icm and the two - dimensional x - ray surface brightness .",
    "when one considers the projection of galaxy clusters to two dimensions for mock x - ray observations , the power spectrum of the fluctuations is important in addition to the pdf of the inhomogeneity . here , we once again turn to simulations to investigate the power spectrum of the fluctuations .",
    "we extract the six massive clusters from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the local universe performed by @xcite .",
    "the simulations utilize the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) method , and assume a flat @xmath24 cdm universe with @xmath25 , and a dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the number of dark matter and sph particles is @xmath27 million each within a high - resolution sphere of radius @xmath28 mpc , which is embedded in a periodic box @xmath29 mpc on a side that is filled with nearly seven million low - resolution dark matter particles .",
    "the simulation is designed to reproduce the matter distribution of the local universe by adopting the initial conditions based on the _ iras _ galaxy distribution smoothed over a scale of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the six massive clusters are identified as coma , perseus , virgo , centaurus , a3627 , and hydra .",
    "a cubic region with 6 @xmath31 mpc on a side centered on each simulated cluster is extracted and divided into @xmath32 cells .",
    "the density and temperature of each mesh point are calculated from sph particles using the b - spline smoothing kernel .",
    "a detailed description of this procedure is given in paper i. the distance between two adjacent grid points is given by @xmath33 kpc , which is comparable to the gravitational force resolution ( 14 kpc ) and the inter - particle separation reached by sph particles in the dense centers of clusters .",
    "therefore , the ( maximum ) resolution is @xmath34 assuming @xmath35 kpc .",
    "this is about one order of magnitude worse than that of both the synthetic clusters (   [ sec : synthetic ] ) and the observational data (   [ sec : obs ] ) .    for each simulated cluster ,",
    "we compute the radially averaged density and temperature profiles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively ( eqn . [ [ eq : averagen ] ] and [ [ eq : averaget ] ] ) , and use them to compute the density and temperature fluctuations @xmath36 and @xmath37 at each grid point .",
    "we extract @xmath38 cells of @xmath14 and @xmath15 around the center of a simulated cluster and compute the power spectrum .",
    "the distance from the center to the corner of the @xmath38 cells is @xmath39 mpc which is approximately equal to the virial radius of the simulated clusters ( @xmath40-@xmath41 mpc ) .",
    "the virial radius , @xmath42 , is the radius within which the mean interior density is 200 times that of the critical density .",

    "the power spectra for both the density and temperature are relatively well approximated by a single power law .",

    "the resolution of our current simulations , however , is limited , especially when compared to the resolution available from current generation x - ray satellites .",
    "in addition , we need to systematically survey the parameter space of @xmath45 and @xmath46 in order to relate the x - ray surface brightness fluctuations to the density fluctuations .",
    "thus we create a set of synthetic clusters at higher resolution that have lognormal fluctuations around their mean profile .",
    "analysis of mock observations of these synthetic clusters enables us to investigate the relation between the x - ray surface brightness and the statistical properties of the three - dimensional density fluctuations , namely @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the three - dimensional synthetic clusters will be projected to two dimensions when considering the x - ray surface brightness . in order to incorporate a power - law type power spectrum of spatial fluctuations into the synthetic clusters ,",
    "we follow a similar methodology as that of several studies of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "first a gaussian random field with a power - law power spectrum is constructed and that field is mapped into a lognormal field . therefore , our assumption for the power spectrum is adopted for the gaussian field @xmath47 as opposed to @xmath48 .",

    "<S> we analyze _ chandra _  observations of the galaxy cluster abell 3667 , and find that its x - ray surface brightness fluctuations follow the lognormal distribution . while the lognormal model was originally motivated by cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , this is the first observational confirmation of the lognormal signature in a real cluster .    </S>",

    "<S> the empirical relation between the two- and three - dimensional fluctuation properties calibrated with synthetic clusters when applied to simulated clusters shows large scatter . </S>",
