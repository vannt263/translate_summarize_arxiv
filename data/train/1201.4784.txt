    "<S> conclusive experimental evidence of a supersolid phase in any known condensed matter system is presently lacking . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a supersolid phase has been recently predicted for a system of spinless bosons in continuous space , interacting via a broad class of soft - core , repulsive potentials . </S>",
    "<S> such an interaction can be engineered in assemblies of ultracold atoms , providing a well - defined pathway to the unambiguous observation of this fascinating phase of matter . in this article , we study by first principle computer simulations the elementary excitation spectrum of the supersolid , and show that it features two distinct modes , namely a solid - like phonon and a softer collective excitation , related to broken translation and gauge symmetry respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence , physical properties and possible observation of a supersolid phase of matter , have been the subject of intense scientific debate for decades@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a phase should feature the seemingly antithetic properties of crystalline order and superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the investigative effort , aimed at identifying and characterizing this phase in known condensed matter systems , has focused on the most obvious candidate , namely solid @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> presently , however , consensus is lacking as to whether the existing experimental evidence unambiguously points to supersolidity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in recent times , attention has turned to the field of ultracold atoms as a possible experimental venue affording supersolid behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations have yielded evidence of a supersolid phase in a two - dimensional system of spinless bosons in continuous space ( i.e. , _ not _ on a lattice ) , interacting through a specific class of soft - core repulsive potentials@xcite . at low temperature and high density , despite the repulsive character of the interaction , particles pile up in clusters , in turn forming a periodic array , to which we refer as  cluster crystal\"@xcite : this is a lattice with a basis of @xmath1 particles of the same kind and null basis vector . </S>",
    "<S> this solid turns superfluid at temperatures sufficiently low that phase coherence can be established through quantum hopping of particles across lattice sites ( i.e. , adjacent clusters ) . </S>",
    "<S> + to our knowledge , the particular soft - core interaction that underlies this supersolid phase does not occur in ordinary condensed matter systems ; however , it can be engineered for ultracold atoms@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this could pave the way for a clear - cut experimental realization of this up to now elusive phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , soft - core bosons may be regarded as the archetypal supersolid , an ideal playground wherein fundamental properties of the supersolid phase of matter can be explored . of particular interest is the spectrum of elementary excitations of a supersolid , which offers access to arguably even more cogent information on the physics of a system , than structural or energetic properties of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> + there are a number of outstanding issues , regarding the basic features of the dynamic response function of a supersolid . for example , it is not obvious how the excitation spectrum would combine specific traits of a solid and of a superfluid , i.e. , whether two separate goldstone modes should be present , reflecting the two broken symmetries , or a single mode of distinct , different character . also of interest </S>",
    "<S> is establishing whether the excitation spectrum of a superfluid system , that also breaks translational invariance , displays a roton minimum . </S>",
    "<S> these fundamental issues go to the heart not only of supersolidity , but of our current , general understanding of quantum many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the experimental study of the dynamic structure factor in assemblies of ultracold atoms has recently begun@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this article , we report results of a calculation of the low - temperature excitation spectrum of density fluctuations@xcite in the dense fluid , cluster crystal and supersolid cluster crystal phases . </S>",
    "<S> we take the soft - disk ( sd ) potential as representative@xcite of the class of interactions described above , which support the phases of interest here . </S>",
    "<S> + we find that a new branch of acoustic modes appears , not specifically related to the phonon - maxon - roton of the superfluid or the phonons in the solid . </S>",
    "<S> this branch , which has an analogue in the spectrum of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) in its superfluid phase@xcite , can be related to the breaking of the gauge symmetry@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the system in reduced units is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance between particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the particle number . the diameter @xmath7 of the soft disks is taken as the unit of length , while @xmath8 is the energy unit . </S>",
    "<S> the system is enclosed in a cell of area @xmath9 , with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we express the density @xmath10 through the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 , i.e. , the mean interparticle distance . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a range of density where the mean number @xmath1 of particles per site in the cluster crystal phase is relatively high ( roughly between ten and twenty)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we use the worm algorithm in the continuous - space path - integral representation@xcite to simulate the system described by ( [ mod ] ) in the grand canonical ensemble ( i.e. , at fixed temperature @xmath12 , area @xmath9 and chemical potential @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation gives an unbiased , accurate numerical estimate of the imaginary - time intermediate scattering function @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the density fluctuation operator at wavevector @xmath16 and the brackets denote a thermal average . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic structure factor @xmath17 , which measures the excitation spectrum of the density fluctuations , is related to @xmath18 via an inverse laplace transform : @xmath19 it is well known that there exists no general scheme to invert a laplace transform from noisy data , in a way that is reliable , accurate and controlled . however , for physical spectra whose dominant contribution is given by a few well - defined peaks , some techniques are able to identify satisfactorily locations and spectral weights of those peaks . in this work , we made use of the genetic inversion via falsification of theories ( gift)@xcite approach for the numerical inversion of the laplace transform ( [ sqomega ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to superfluid @xmath0he , the gift method has been shown to separate correctly the sharp quasiparticle peak of the phonon - maxon - roton elementary excitation from the broad multiphonon contribution@xcite , whereas the more commonly adopted maximum entropy scheme@xcite tends to merge both structures@xcite . alongside with this method , using the information on the number @xmath20 of excitations visible in the reconstructed spectrum , we compute the energy of the @xmath20 observed excitations by assuming the spectrum @xmath17 as a function of @xmath21 only is constituted by @xmath20 delta functions ( @xmath20-pole approximation ) and fit their positions and strengths to the available @xmath18 data . </S>",
    "<S> +    figure [ sqom_all ] , colormap , shows gift reconstructions of the dynamical structure factor @xmath17 in the superfluid , supersolid and cluster crystal phases ; datapoints are obtained from the @xmath20-pole approximation instead . in the superfluid phase ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sqom_all ] a ) , the spectrum is characterized by the usual phonon - maxon - roton dispersion , with the notable peculiarity that the roton minimum is located just short of @xmath22 , rather than around @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the incipient crystallization takes place with a lattice parameter larger than the mean interparticle distance . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , upon increasing @xmath13 , the superfluid undergoes a first order phase transition into a triangular cluster ( super)solid with a lattice spacing @xmath24 somewhat larger than @xmath7@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the spectrum of the cluster crystal is also standard ( we have studied longitudinal excitations only ) . figure [ sqom_all]c ) shows that , within the first brillouin zone , most of the spectral weight is concentrated in an acoustic phonon band . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a non - negligible zero - frequency contribution at all wavelengths , representing a diffusive mode of lattice defects ( phase - incoherent hopping of particles between multiply occupied sites ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe for some @xmath16-points the presence of an optical mode , which might be the analog of the highly degenerate breathing mode of individual clusters observed for classical cluster systems@xcite , but we do not determine its dispersion relation here . </S>",
    "<S> + the excitation spectrum of the supersolid phase ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sqom_all]b ) , is the central result of this work . the spectral weight is clearly partitioned in two distinct branches . </S>",
    "<S> the higher - energy mode is a longitudinal acoustic phonon , with a linear dispersion at small @xmath16 and near the reciprocal lattice vector ( the end of the @xmath16 scale in the figure ) , and frequencies between the phonon - maxon of the liquid and the longitudinal phonon of the solid . </S>",
    "<S> this assignment is further supported by the following analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the average potential @xmath25 felt by a test particle across a lattice site ( upper panel of figure [ density_confronto ] , also showing the particle density profile ) . </S>",
    "<S> we define a force constant by fitting a quadratic potential to the bottom of @xmath25 , and obtain the phonon frequency of a harmonic crystal with that force constant and the average mass of a cluster , given by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the sound velocity of the harmonic crystal is in satisfactory agreement ( to within @xmath26 ) with the slope of the phononic branch of the supersolid displayed in figure [ sqom_all ] b ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the lower branch of the supersolid spectrum is also acoustic .    </S>",
    "<S> its nature is assessed by studying its behaviour as the superfluid fraction @xmath27 decreases on approaching the transition to the normal cluster crystal . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ spectrum_confronto ] displays @xmath28 at the brillouin zone edge for @xmath29 , as in figure [ sqom_all]b ) , and for a denser system at @xmath30 where the system is still supersolid but @xmath27 drops from 0.30 to 0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> when the density increases the particles progressively get more localized around lattice sites , as shown by the density profiles of figure [ density_confronto ] , and the system gets stiffer . correspondingly , the high energy peak of the supersolid spectrum shifts to higher frequencies , as expected for a phonon - like excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy mode instead loses spectral weight following the loss of superfluid fraction , and shifts to lower frequencies , reducing its bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained if superfluidity is suppressed by increasing the strength ( @xmath31 ) of the interaction , at fixed density . </S>",
    "<S> the lower branch is thus seen to be largely unrelated to the spectra of the superfluid or the cluster solid phases . </S>",
    "<S> it could only be related to the phonon - maxon - roton of the superfluid if the density modulation of the supersolid could vanish smoothly . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is preempted , however , by the first - order phase transition at the melting density of the supersolid .     </S>",
    "<S> + the structural properties of the cluster crystal@xcite , with particles hopping between adjacent lattice sites , suggest an analogy with the bose - hubbard model which is clearly born by the spectral properties of both systems . </S>",
    "<S> while in continuous space the lattice is self - assembled , and thus features vibrational modes that are obviously absent in the bhm , the lower branch of the supersolid phase shows noteworthy similarities with the acoustic excitation present in the superfluid phase of the bhm . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , its behaviour for wavelengths approaching the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath32 parallels the expected linear vanishing of the superfluid mode of the bhm . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations use a finite simulation cell , implying a minimum distance of the wavevector from @xmath32 . within this limitation , we find that the spectrum of the cluster supersolid is gapless at the reciprocal lattice vectors , i.e. there is no roton minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the analogy between the supersolid cluster crystal and the bhm superfluid is further supported by the softening of the low energy branch of the supersolid observed for increasing density ( and/or increasing @xmath31 ) , figure [ spectrum_confronto ] . </S>",
    "<S> a higher density implies reduced hopping probability and enhanced on - site repulsion , as shown in figure [ density_confronto ] . in the bhm </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to lowering the @xmath33 ratio , which in turn is known to reduce the bandwidth of the superfluid acoustic mode of the superfluid phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition between supersolid and cluster solid observed in the sd system has thus some bearing with the superfluid to mott insulator ( mi ) quantum transition in the bhm . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a full correspondence , as finite temperature and lattice dynamics contribute to stabilize a compressible cluster solid phase with non - integer mean occupation of lattice sites , more similar to the normal liquid ( nl ) than the mi phase of the bhm ; on the other hand , the finite temperature nl and mi phases are not fundamentally different , being connected by a crossover upon varying @xmath33@xcite .    in the bhm , where the translation invariance is explicitly broken , the presence of an acoustic mode is due to long - range phase coherence , which breaks the continuous gauge symmetry . in a continuous space superfluid , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding mode is second sound . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is not seen in the spectrum of the sd superfluid phase ( figure [ sqom_all]a ) , where its spectral weight is presumably exceedingly low . in view of the analogy between the sd supersolid and the bhm superfluid , </S>",
    "<S> we are led to suggest that the lower branch of the supersolid is a kind of second sound . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the presence of a second longitudinal acoustic branch in a supersolid is a common feature of several phenomenological models , which assume some degree of phase coherence and the possibility of a density modulation not commensurate to the particle number@xcite . in particular , ref . characterizes this second branch in the supersolid phase as a brillouin peak , with out - of - phase fluctuations of the normal and the superfluid density , emerging from the defects - associated rayleigh mode of the normal solid , much as second sound in superfluid @xmath0he@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + summarizing , we have carried out a numerical study of the excitation spectrum of a model cluster supersolid . </S>",
    "<S> the main finding is that two well - defined , distinct acoustic modes are present in the supersolid phase . the higher - energy branch is determined by the lattice dynamics , while the softer mode is uniquely due to the presence of a finite superfluid fraction . </S>",
    "<S> its dispersion closely parallels that of the excitation spectrum of a superfluid bose - hubbard model : it further softens as superfluidity is demoted approaching the insulating solid phase ; furthermore , for the system sizes studied here , it looks linearly vanishing at the reciprocal lattice vectors , rather than featuring a finite roton minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization of a ss system similar to that studied here appears possible in assemblies of ultracold atoms@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the double acoustic excitations , peculiar to the supersolid phase , could be detected via bragg spectroscopy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this could be an interesting experimental verification of our findings , and a tool for identifying the supersolid phase unambiguously as well .    </S>",
