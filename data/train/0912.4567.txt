    "it is also possible to create ferromagnetism and superconductivity in graphene via the proximity effect .",
    "superconductivity is one of the interesting properties of graphene . in nature , graphene is a zero - gap semiconductor and not a superconductor .",
    "however , superconductivity of graphene may be induced by placing a superconducting electrode on the top of graphene via the proximity effect@xcite or coating a sheet of graphene with metallic atoms@xcite .",
    "there have been many studies on superconductivity of graphene .",

    "interestingly , for a doped nonmagnetic graphene superconducting junction with @xmath136 comparable to @xmath19 and @xmath137 , @xmath120 is not equal to @xmath119 either .",
    "the fermi energy of a conventinal metal , such as cu or al , is in the order of 1 ev@xcite and hence is several thousand times as big as the bias voltage @xmath136 . for conventional nonmagnetic metals ,",
    "therefore , @xmath138 , where the fermi wave vector @xmath139 , and the incident angle @xmath119 is always equal to the andreev reflected angle @xmath120 .",
    "it is interesting that for a graphene superconducting junction , when @xmath140 , the path of the andreev reflected hole would severely deviate from the normal line at the small incident angle . by changing the fermi energy via a gate voltage",
    ", we can reach the condition of @xmath140 easily . fig .",
    "3 illustrates the modified retro - andreev reflection , specular andreev reflection and normal reflection . from fig .",
    "3 , it can be seen that the normal reflection in a graphene superconducting junction is not qualitatively different from a conventional superconducting junction .",
    "however , the retro- and specular reflectivity of andreev reflection can be drastically broken under the effect of the exchange energy and the bias for the graphene superconducting junction .",
    "in addition , when either @xmath141 or @xmath142 changes sign , there is a trasition between the retro - andreeve reflection and specular andreev reflection .",
    "this happens at a dirac point .",
    "2(b ) for example , the dirac points of the bands of the spin - down electron and hole excitations are located at @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "an incident spin - up electron proceeds with the specular andreev reflection when @xmath145 .",
    "as the bias voltage @xmath136 is increased up to the dirac point of the band of the spin - down electron(@xmath146 ) , the electron would undergo the retro - andreev reflection .",
    "keeping increasing the bias voltage , the electron would proceed with the specular andreev reflection again when @xmath147 .",
    "similarly , a trasition between the retro - andreeve reflection and specular andreev reflection occurs at the dirac points as a spin - up electron incidents . in short , for a graphene fis junction , there are two transition points .",
    "this is quite different from a graphene nis junction which has only a transition point .",
    "measurement of spin polarization is an important subject in spintronics .",
    "there are several ways to measure spin polarization , such as spin - polarized photoemission spectroscopy@xcite , meservey - tedrow spin tunnelling spectroscopy@xcite and andreev reflection spectrum@xcite .",
    "the btk formula provide a quite simple method to measure the spin polarization of a metal by andreev reflection spectrum .",
    "how to define the spin polarization is also a valuable question and has been discussed before by mazin@xcite .",
    "the most popular definition of spin polarization in a ferromagnet is @xmath148 , where @xmath149 [ @xmath150 denotes spin - up [ down ] dos at the fermi level . for a conventional metal , the fermi level does not move much when a bias is applied , and the dos remains almost constant .",
    "now consider the effect of the bias on the dos for graphene . @xmath151 and @xmath152 are now given in eq .",
    "therefore , the spin polarization of dos can be written as , @xmath153    the spin polarization in a graphene ferromagnetic segment varies with the applied voltage . when @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "conversely , @xmath156 . in the low bias regime ( @xmath157 )",
    ", we find that @xmath158 if @xmath159 and @xmath160 if @xmath161 .",
    "the spin polarization becomes independent of @xmath136 .",
    "furthermore , it is counterintuitive that the spin polarization is not always positively correlated with @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that we could increase the spin polarization in graphene by tuning the fermi energy via a gate voltage .",
    "the fermi energy in graphene is usually in the order of 0 - 100 mev . for the lightly doped graphene ,",
    "therefore , we only need to apply a gate voltage of a few milli - electron voltage to change the spin polarization in graphene significantly . furthermore , for @xmath162 , graphene is a half metal with @xmath163 .",
    "the exchage energy is fixed by the proximity effect .",
    "hopefully , this interesting prediction of half - metallic graphene will stimulate future experiments on graphene by tuning the gate voltage to the condition of @xmath164 .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth mentioning that when @xmath165 is in the vicinity of the neutrality point ( i.e. the dirac point ) , the carrier density goes to zero .",
    "the electron - hole puddles can appear at low carrier densities and in the presence of disorder.@xcite in this case , local variations of the fermi energy should be taken into account .",
    "it is well known that a perfect graphene sheet is very difficult to obtain experimentally@xcite .",
    "therefore , in experiments , corrugations are one source of disorder .",
    "fascinatingly , it has been very recently demonstrated that an ultraflat graphene with height variation less than 25 pm can be obtained@xcite , suggesting that disorder induced behaviors such as electron - hole puddle formation , of graphene could be avoided . in a ferromagnetic graphene , the carrier density of spin - down electrons would approach zero in the vicinity of @xmath4 at @xmath164 .",
    "however , unlike in nonmagnetic graphenes , the dirac points of different spin species in a ferromagnetic graphene are not located at the same position .",
    "therefore , the total carrier density is not necessarily close to zero as @xmath165 approaches @xmath4 , and our calculations would be still valid in the sufficiently clean ( little dirty ) regime .     with @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",

    "due to spin diffusion@xcite , the spin current in the junction does not remain constant , and indeed , deep inside the superconductor , @xmath169 of the tunneling current would go to zero .",
    "we show the spin polarization of tunneling current as a function of bias voltage in fig .",

    ". @xmath230 decreases with increasing @xmath4 and hence the transimission of quasiparticles in region s falls as @xmath4 raises .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 reduces the conductance even if @xmath223 is enhanced by @xmath4 .      from fig .",
    "5(b ) , we find the conductance still oscillates as a function of @xmath3 with a period @xmath231 like a graphene nis junction under the effect of exchange energy .",

    "7(b ) and ( c ) show that the transmission coefficient also depends on the spin of incident electrons for the fis junction .",

    ", we do not represent the transmission of the case with @xmath187 .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of any incident angle would increases the amplitude of oscillation ( @xmath270 ) . in short , the increase of critical angle",

    "a , we do not consider the evanescent wave functions when we calculate the conductance of the fis junction . as stated above , in the low bias regime , for @xmath226 , @xmath214 . from eq .",
    "( 8) , we see that if @xmath189 , @xmath271 decreases with increasing @xmath4 and conversely , @xmath271 increases with increasing @xmath4 . however , for @xmath272 , @xmath216 .",

    "in fact , at these dirac points , the transitions between the specular andreev reflection and andreev retroreflection happen , as mentioned in sec .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the transport properties of a graphene fis junction within the btk formalism . unlike the previous works on grephene fs junctions@xcite , among other things , we study the spin - polarization of tunneling current at the i - s interface and also invesigate how the exchange energy influences the characteristic conductance oscillation behavior in graphene junctions .",
