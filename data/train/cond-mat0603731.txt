    "a classical theory of this effect was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . at high temperatures",
    "there are two contributions to the effect :    \\a ) the first contribution is purely classical and it can be described in the framework of the boltzmann kinetic equation : an electric field accelerates electrons creating a non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "this non - equilibrium distribution function consists of two parts : an anisotropic - in - momentum part that is proportional to @xmath10 and a quadratic - in-@xmath10 contribution which is isotropic in the momentum .",
    "in isotropic media , the relaxation of this non - equilibrium distribution due to inelastic scattering processes yields no net current ; however , in non - centrosymetric media and in the presence of the magnetic field , the inelastic relaxation rate has odd in electron momentum components , which give rise to the odd - in-@xmath1 part of eq .",
    "[ eq : inlgen ] described by @xmath12 .",

    "the description of these processes is beyond the classical boltzmann kinetic equation . in non - equilibrium and non - centro - symmetric media and in the presence of the magnetic field",
    "these shifts take place in a particular direction determined by a crystal symmetry , and lead to an odd in @xmath1 contribution in the net current through the sample .",
    "this contribution is similar to that discussed in the framework of the anomalous hall effect @xcite .",
    "the above two contributions to @xmath12 are proportional to the inelastic electron relaxation rate @xmath18 , and consequently , they vanish at @xmath19 ( there are of course contributions from the above effect to the i - v characteristics which at @xmath19 are proportional to higher powers of @xmath10 ) .    it has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that in mesoscopic metallic samples , where all spatial symmetries are broken , there is an odd - in-@xmath1 contribution to eq .",
    "[ eq : inlgen ] which survives in the limit @xmath19 and which therefore determines the magnitude of the effect at small @xmath20 .",
    "this effect has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "as usual for mesoscopic effects , this contribution is due to random electronic interference",
    ". therefore it exhibits random sample specific oscillations as a function of the external magnetic field , temperature and the electron chemical potential .",
    "the characteristic feature of the effect is that it is proportional to the amplitude of the electron - electron interaction rather than the scattering rate .",
    "the qualitative explanation of the effect is the following @xcite : the linear in @xmath10 mesoscopic fluctuations of the current density are due to random interference of electron waves travelling along different diffusive paths .",
    "though the total current through the sample should be an even function of @xmath1 , the local current densities contain a part which is odd - in-@xmath1 . by the same token",

    "these nonequilibrium densities create an additional random potential due to electron - electron interaction @xmath23 and an additional exchange magnetic field @xmath24 were @xmath25 are interaction constants .",

    "we show that in the case of parallel magnetic field , the effect exists entirely due to spin - orbit scattering . the temperature dependence of the magnitude of the effect ( both in parallel and in the perpendicular magnetic field ) randomly oscillates with a characteristic period on the order of the temperature itself .",
    "we also take into account the exchange contribution to the effect and clarify the nature of the electron - electron interaction constant which determines the value of @xmath12 in eq.[eq : inlgen ] .",
    "let us consider a sample shown in the insert of fig.1 with the characteristic size @xmath30 which is much larger than the electron elastic mean free path @xmath31 . in this limit @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we shall characterize the magnitude of the current by the variance @xmath33 . before averaging over random potential configurations , to first order in the electron - electron interaction constant ,",

    "1a . after averaging , the quantity @xmath35 is given by diagrams shown in fig . 1d . in these diagrams ,",
    "the solid lines which correspond to the electron green functions carry frequencies on the order of the temperature @xmath20 , so we can neglect frequency dependence of interaction propagators .",

    "the system of equations [ deltau],[deltah],[inl],[eq : beta ] is a generalization of that in ref .",

    "[ eq : beta ] is typical for many effects in mesoscopic conductors with interacting electrons ( see for example aronovaltshuler , aleiner ) .",

    "the magnitude of the effect is proportional to @xmath47 .    to get eq .",
    "[ eq : inlgen ] one has to expand the expression for the conductance in eq .",

    "we assume boundary conditions , which correspond to zero current through a closed boundary , and @xmath54 at the open boundary . generally speaking the electron density @xmath55 and , consequently @xmath28 contain all spatial harmonics , and the problem is similar to the sensitivity of the sample conductance to a change in the scattering potential @xmath28 considered in leestone , altshulerspivak .",

    "[ fafterav ] converges quickly and , consequently , the main contribution comes from the zero - harmonic with @xmath78 ( this fact is related to the long range character of the correlation function of the part of the electron densities which are proportional to @xmath10 @xcite ) .",

    "[ eq : inlgen ] .    at some level",

    "@xcite electrons scatter on equilibrium friedel oscillations of the electron density , which are even in @xmath139 . at @xmath140",

    "the origin of our effect is the electron scattering on non - equilibrium fluctuations of the electron density . in this case",
    "the electron interaction determines the magnitude of the effect .",
    "the effect considered above is also different from classical effects @xcite the amplitude of which is proportional to the inelastic relaxation rate and which does not exhibit oscillations as a function of temperature , magnetic field and the chemical potential .",
    "the magnitude of the effect discussed above decays as the temperature increases .",
    "if the crystalline structure of the material is non - centro - symmetric , at high enough temperatures , the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath102 is determined by the `` classical '' effects considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , if the structure of the pure crystal is centro - symmetric , then the only source of the effect at high temperatures is the non - centro - symmetric distribution of the scattering potential @xmath141 . in this case",
    "the effect is of a classical nature .",
    "namely , one should consider the classical motion of interacting electrons in the presence of a frozen random potential , similar to what has been done for average quantities in @xcite .",
    "this problem however , is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "finally we would like to discuss a difference between our approach and the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite . at @xmath19 and in the absence of the electron interaction",
    "the landauer formula in a combination with the random matrix theory has been a useful tool for describing the linear conductance of mesoscopic samples . in this approximation",
    "it can be derived from the kubo formula @xcite . however , even in this case the derivation can be carried out only in the case of ideal leads , @xmath142 , when incident and transmitted waves through the sample are well defined . at finite temperature , and in the absence of inelastic processes @xmath143 equation [ landauer ] still can be applied . however , to describe the temperature dependence of the conductance @xmath144 one has to know delicate properties of the energy dependencies of the matrix elements @xmath145 . at even higher temperatures , @xmath146 , when inelastic scattering processes are significant , eq . [ landauer ] can not be applied .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the electron channels ( and even their number ) in eq .",
    "[ landauer ] are not well defined in this case .",
    "for example , the landauer formula can not reproduce the well - known bloch @xmath147 and @xmath148 temperature dependencies of resistivity of bulk metals associated with electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering @xcite .",
    "it also can not reproduce electron interaction corrections to the conductance considered in @xcite .",
    "sometimes the landauer approach gives correct results for linear conductance of samples even in the case when the leads are not ideal and @xmath149 .",
    "consider for example a constriction between two semi - infinite 3d metals and assume that the diffusion coefficient is independent of the coordinates .",
    "the landauer formula still gives a correct result for the conductance of the sample in a single particle approximation because the conductance is determined by the part of the sample near the constriction . on the other hand , the magnetic field @xmath150 and the temperature @xmath151 dependencies of the conductance in this case",
    "are determined by the interference of diffusive paths travelling on distances of order of the magnetic length @xmath152 and the coherence length @xmath153 of the normal metal . at small @xmath154 and",
    "@xmath155 these lengths are much bigger than the constriction size , and they diverge as @xmath156 . as a result , in the case of non - ideal leads , @xmath157 , and in the absence of inelastic phase breaking processes ,",
    "the periods of oscillations of @xmath158 as a function of @xmath159 and @xmath160 decrease at small @xmath96 and @xmath20 , and the derivatives @xmath161 and @xmath162 diverge at @xmath163 and @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "to cut off these divergencies one has to take into account inelastic electron scattering processes .",
    "such effects are beyond the landauer formula .",
    "the situation with non - linear parts of the i - v characteristics is more complicated . in the single particle approximation",
    "the i - v characteristics can be expressed in terms of the @xmath165-dependence of the matrix elements @xmath166 , where @xmath165 is the electron energy .",

    "can not be justified even in the case of ideal leads , and even at @xmath19 .",
    "one of the reasons is that in the presence of electron - electron and electron - phonon inelastic processes allowed at @xmath168 , the electron channels are not well defined . in other words",
    "the voltage plays the role similar to the temperature , and at @xmath169 there exist effects which are similar to @xmath20-dependent interactional corrections to conductivity @xcite . on the other hand , at small voltages these processes lead to the value of @xmath75 proportional to a power of v greater than or equal to three .",
