    "it has been realized by gribov already before the advent of qcd that there exists a deep relation between the phenomenon of high - energy diffraction and the nuclear shadowing phenomenon @xcite . in particular ,",

    "@xmath17 is the invariant mass squared of the quark - gluon system to which a virtual photon is transformed @xcite . in the case of the charged parton structure functions ( @xmath13 ) connection between shadowing and",
    "diffraction has been explored for a long time , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the importance of the color fluctuations - weakly interacting configurations in the shadowing phenomenon was first understood in @xcite where this effect has been estimated based on the qcd aligned jet model and included in the calculation of @xmath13 .",
    "additional contributions to the nuclear structure function are related to the piece of the photon wave function for which the coherence length @xmath18 is of the order of the average internucleon distance @xmath19 .",
    "these important nuclear effects have been estimated and explored in @xcite using constraints which follow from the qcd momentum and baryon sum rules .",
    "account for these effects leads to a more complicated qcd evolution which mixes shadowing region and the region of larger @xmath20 .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite we started analysis of the implications of the information which is now available from hera on the role of the gluon degrees of freedom in the diffractive processes in dis for the gluon nuclear shadowing .",
    "we were able to study shadowing for @xmath8 and @xmath21gev@xmath22 and predict a factor @xmath23 larger shadowing for the gluon channel than for the quark channel .",
    "this is in line with expectations of @xcite , though it differs from the pattern assumed in a number of the models , see e.g. for the recent summary @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will extend this analysis to a broad range of @xmath20 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main tool we will use is the qcd factorization theorem for the hard diffractive scattering @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "application of the qcd factorization theorem makes it possible to establish correspondence between the deuteron(nucleus ) infinite momentum frame ( imf ) and the rest frame descriptions and therefore to explore advantages of both descriptions .",
    "an evident advantage of the imf description is the simple interpretation of the momentum and the baryon sum rules . on the other hand space - time development of high energy processes and nuclear shadowing phenomenon",
    "have a more clear interpretation within the nucleus rest frame approach .",
    "using the qcd factorization theorem @xcite and the gribov analysis of nuclear shadowing we will derive the model independent expressions for the leading twist nuclear shadowing of parton densities in the case of coherent interactions with two nucleons ( section 2 ) .",
    "however the shadowing due to the interaction with two nucleons can not diminish the parton density by more than a factor of 0.75 without introducing ghosts into the theory ( see discussion in the end of section 3 ) .",
    "hence in section 3 we use the recent analysis @xcite of the hera diffractive data to extract the information on the s - channel dynamics of diffraction which is necessary to calculate the effects of coherent interactions with @xmath3 nucleons .",
    "we find out that this analysis implies that the average strength of the interaction responsible for the diffraction in the gluon channel at the resolution scale @xmath24gev and @xmath8 is very large : @xmath25 .",
    "large value of the interaction strength could be related to the large cross section of the small color octet dipole interaction with a nucleon which is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath28 larger than for the case of `` color triplet dipole '' @xcite .",
    "if we take for @xmath29 the value we estimated before for the color triplet case : @xmath30 , we find that the cross section is close to the @xmath31-channel unitarity limit for the range of applicability of dglap approximation corresponding to @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 gev@xmath22 .    for the scattering of a system with a radius @xmath35 the slope of the elastic scattering",
    "is given by the square of the two - gluon form factor @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "for this situation condition @xmath38 corresponds to the effective cross section of @xmath39 .",
    "this value is close to the one which emerges from the analysis of the diffractive data where the size of diffractive system is smaller though not negligible as compared to the nucleon size .",
    "note also that the smallness of the shrinkage of the diffractive cone for the @xmath10 elastic photoproduction ( @xmath40 for @xmath41 between 5 and 200 gev as compared to @xmath42 expected in the soft regime ) indicates that perturbative physics occupies most of the rapidity range for @xmath43 for hera energy range .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that inapplicability of the dglap evolution equation and possible closeness to the unitarity limit we discuss here are due to the growth of @xmath44 generated predominantly by the @xmath45 terms in the dglap evolution equations rather than solely by the @xmath46 terms which would be the bfkl approximation . hence the pattern discussed here is qualitatively different from the bfkl scenario of high - energy dynamics . indeed , large values of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 in the small @xmath20 hera kinematics and growing with @xmath49 as @xmath50 ) emerge not because of long ladders in rapidity - the ladders contain no more than 2 - 3 gluons in the multi - regge kinematics , but rather due to a large number of emitters at the lower resolution scale .",
    "possible closeness to the unitarity limit makes it likely that for moderate @xmath51 corrections to the dglap predictions for the nuclear shadowing would be rather large .",
    "this would primarily affect our predictions for moderate @xmath4 since the information about the gluon induced diffraction is obtained predominantly at larger @xmath4 and extrapolated to lower @xmath4 via the dglap equations .    in section 4",
    "we first analyze the dynamics of the fluctuations of the interaction strength ( color coherence - color opacity and color transparency phenomena ) and explain that significant fluctuations of the strength of interaction should be present in particular due to the qcd evolution .",
    "next we study the nuclear shadowing originating from the interactions with @xmath3 nucleons .",
    "we point out that the eikonal type approximation seems reasonable in the soft qcd regime when the projectile wave function contains a large number of constituents . on the contrary in the pqcd regime where photon wave function is given by a @xmath52 dipole",
    "not more than two inelastic collisions are allowed by energy conservation law . otherwise the energy released in the inelastic collisions calculated through the cuts of exchanged parton ladders will be larger than the sum of the energies of the colliding particles .",
    "evaluation of a larger number of rescatterings in pqcd is beyond the scope of the naive semiclassical approximation and requires an accurate account of the space - time evolution of the scattering process , in particular a calculation of the nlo approximation to the photon wave function .",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath3 interactions are sensitive to the existence of the fluctuations of the interaction strength .",
    "this sensitivity is rather small for @xmath53 . for such @xmath54",
    "we predict significantly larger shadowing for gluons : @xmath55 than for quarks : @xmath56 . for larger @xmath54 sensitivity to fluctuations",
    "steadily increases .",
    "however we find that the average interaction strength in the gluon channel is large at the normalization scale of @xmath57 gev so a significant nuclear shadowing of average and larger than average interaction strengths into the cross section is determined by the geometry of collisions and rather insensitive to the structure of the distribution over the strengths . as a result of shadowing of strongly interacting ( nonperturbative ? ) configurations , the relative contribution of the interactions with small @xmath58 is strongly enhanced in the parton distributions in heavy nuclei .",
    "we estimate possible effects of the weakly interacting configurations and find that they may contribute up to 50 % to @xmath59 . at the same time",
    "the fraction of the cross section due to weakly interacting configurations should diminish with decrease of @xmath20 .",
    "we want to stress here that the use of information on the diffraction in dis at hera allows us to take into account the nonperturbative effects in the gluon nuclear parton densities at the boundary of the qcd evolution . in the previous studies",
    "the gluon shadowing either was treated purely perturbatively as for example in the imf model of mclerran and venugopalan @xcite or it was introduced in a phenomenological way assuming similarity between the shadowing in the gluon and quark channels , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "overall a currently popular scenario which is used in the discussion of the heavy ion collisions assumes that reduction of gluon densities is a relatively small correction , for the recent review and references see @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce the constraints on the gluon densities which follow from the momentum sum rule and imply presence of the gluon enhancement at @xmath60 .",
    "combing this effect with the quark and gluon shadowing for small @xmath20 we calculate the @xmath61 dependence of the leading twist nuclear densities .",
    "in the end of the section we also consider nuclear structure functions in the limit when the nucleus thickness is large enough so the black disk approximation is applicable .",
    "obviously , the predicted large gluon shadowing has many implications for the various high - energy processes of scattering off nuclei . in section 5",
    "we calculate the impact parameter dependence of the gluon shadowing and briefly analyze two phenomena : the emergence of the color opacity in the coherent production of @xmath10 and @xmath62-mesons from nuclei in the hera kinematics , and the suppression on the minijet production in @xmath63 collisions at the lhc energies .",
    "we find both the color opacity effect and minijet suppression to be very large .",
    "for example , for the lead - lead collisions we predict a suppression of the minijet production at @xmath64 gev / c by a factor @xmath65 .    in section 6",
    "we briefly discuss properties of final states and predict a dip in the ratio of the spectra of leading hadrons produced in the current fragmentation region in ea and in en collisions for rapidities shifted from the maximum rapidity by @xmath66 $ ] where @xmath67 is the average diffractive mass@xmath22 produced in en scattering .    in section 7",
    "we compare our approach with some of the recent studies of the nuclear shadowing .",
    "the studies of the diffraction production in hard processes lead to the introduction of the diffractive parton densities @xmath68 with @xmath69 , which represent the number densities of partons in the initial hadron , but conditional on the detection of the diffracted outgoing hadron @xmath70 in the target fragmentation region with light - cone fraction @xmath71 and fixed momentum transfer @xmath72 .",
    "for example in the case of the diffractive process @xmath73 the diffractive structure function @xmath74 which is introduced via = 2 ^ 2q^4 ( f_2^d - y^2 f_l^d ) , can be written as f_2^d(,q^2,x_ip , t)=_a e^2_a f_a / p(,q^2,x_ip , t ) + ht   corrections . in the case of the proton production this structure of the hard diffractive processes",
    "was first suggested in the framework of the ingelman - schlein model @xcite .",
    "recently it was demonstrated@xcite that the qcd factorization theorem is valid for the @xmath61 evolution of these parton densities at fixed @xmath75 .",
    "the evolution is governed by the same dglap equations as for the inclusive processes .",
    "the hera data on diffraction in dis are consistent with the dominance of the leading twist contribution except near the edge of the phase space ( see discussion below ) .    for the processes dominated by the vacuum channel the gribov theory @xcite unambiguously relates diffractive processes in the scattering of a projectile off a single nucleon to the process of nuclear shadowing due to the interaction of the projectile with two nucleons .",
    "the simplest way to visualize this connection for example in the case of the scattering off the deuteron is to consider @xmath76 scattering in the deuteron rest frame in the kinematics where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the radius of the deuteron ) . due to the difference of the spatial scales characterizing the deuteron and the soft qcd strong interactions , the dominant contribution is given by the diagrams where the photon dissociates into a hadron component before deuteron and",
    "then this component interacts with both nucleons .",
    "let us use the agk theorem @xcite and consider the cut of the double scattering diagram corresponding to the diffractive final state ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the scattering off one nucleon in the @xmath79 state and off the second nucleon in the @xmath80 state .",
    "the final state interaction between nucleons is accounted for as usual within the closure approximation .",
    "the interference between two diagrams results from the fermi motion of nucleons in the deuteron since the spectator nucleon in the @xmath79 state has to have a momentum equal to the momentum of the diffracted nucleon in the @xmath80 state .",
    "the screening effect is expressed ultimately through @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the diffractive amplitude of the interaction of the probe with the nucleon as compared to @xmath83 in the case of diffractive scattering off the nucleon .",
    "the real part of the diffractive amplitude is rather small and can be calculated from the information about the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "thus the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath81 is small and easy to deal with .",
    "hence we can apply the gribov results for the scattering off the deuteron and nuclei to evaluate the shadowing contribution to the deuteron parton density of flavor @xmath84 in terms of the corresponding nucleon diffractive densities ( we consider only the pomeron type contribution , so we do not distinguish diffraction of protons and neutrons ) @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the electromagnetic form factor of the deuteron , and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , in the approximation when only scattering off two nucleons in the nucleus is taken into account one can similarly deduce the expression for the shadowing term in terms of the parton densities f_j",
    "/ a(x , q^2)/a = f_j / n(x ,",

    "[ aeq ] here @xmath89 is the nucleon density in the nucleus normalized according to the equation @xmath90 . for simplicity we gave the expression for the limit when the slope of the dependence of diffractive amplitude on the momentum transferred to target nucleon , @xmath91 , is much smaller than the one due to the nucleus form factor so that impact parameters of two nucleons are equal .",
    "note that eq.[aeq ] is similar to the corresponding expression for the shadowing in the vector dominance model , see eq.(5.4 ) in @xcite since the space - time evolution of the interaction is the same in both cases .",
    "this leads to the same structure of the nuclear block , provided one substitutes the vdm expression for the longitudinal momentum transfer , @xmath92 by the bjorken limit value : @xmath93 .",
    "the crucial feature of eqs.[deuteq],[aeq ] is that the parton densities which enter in the shadowing term evolve according to the leading twist evolution equations .",
    "when they are folded with a function of @xmath94 which does not depend on @xmath4 they retain this property .",
    "since the qcd evolution of real and imaginary parts of hard amplitude is governed by the same evolution equation at sufficiently small @xmath20 we investigate in the paper the fact that real parts enter into diffraction and into shadowing in a different way does not influence the qcd evolution .",
    "this proves that eqs.[deuteq],[aeq ] correspond to the leading twist contribution to the nuclear parton densities .",
    "_ in the limit of the low nuclear densities eqs.[deuteq],[aeq ] provide a complete description of the leading twist nuclear shadowing . _    obviously the derived equations could not provide a complete picture of the deviations of nuclear parton densities from the sum of the nucleon densities for all @xmath20 .",
    "this is because the derived equations take into account the contributions related to the distances @xmath95 but not the ones related to the configurations with much smaller coherence lengths .",
    "the simplest way to estimate the corresponding additional piece is to apply the energy - momentum and baryon sum rules which are exact in qcd for the leading twist parton densities .",
    "therefore to satisfy these sum rules the shadowing should be accompanied by an enhancement of some parton densities at higher @xmath20 .",
    "this enhancement term has to be added to eqs .",
    "[ deuteq],[aeq ] .",
    "if we introduce this term at a scale @xmath96 for @xmath97 it would contribute for large @xmath4 for much smaller @xmath20 .",
    "hence the gribov type approximation becomes inapplicable for fixed @xmath20 and @xmath98 .",
    "emc effect ) but for any practical purposes this effect is negligible . ] below , to deal with the enhancement effects we will adopt the procedure of @xcite in which these effects are estimated at a low normalization point and the subsequent evolution is dealt with by solving the dglap evolution equations .",
    "the range of the validity of approximation where interactions with @xmath3 nucleons are neglected strongly depends on the strength of the corresponding diffraction channel . hence in the next two sections we review the results of the recent analysis of the hera diffractive data and",
    "build approximation for treating interactions with several nucleons .",
    "first , let us briefly summarize the results of the studies of diffraction in dis which were performed over the last few years at electron - proton and proton - antiproton colliders and recast them in the form necessary for the studies of the nuclear shadowing phenomena . the data obtained at hera include studies of the diffractive structure functions in @xmath99 scattering , production of dijets and charm in @xmath100 scattering .",
    "the leading twist contribution appears to describe the data well except very close to the edge of the phase space where higher twist effects are important .",
    "so the factorization theorem for these processes @xcite seems to hold for the studied @xmath4 range , see @xcite for the recent analysis .    in the practical applications",
    "an assumption is usually made that the semiinclusive parton densities at small values of @xmath94 can be written as a product of a function of @xmath94 and a parton density which depends on @xmath101 and @xmath4 .",
    "hence for the sake of brevity we will refer to these densities as the parton densities in the `` pomeron .",
    "'' contributions of the higher twist to diffraction become important which are proportional to @xmath102 and hence lead to intercept of the effective  pomeron ",

    "should be more close to @xmath105 familiar from the soft qcd interactions .",
    "these are particular illustrations of the deep difference between the qcd factorization theorem and the regge pole factorization @xcite .",
    "note also that the energy dependence of diffraction is different from that for soft hadronic processes .",
    "this is not surprising since the coherence length for the soft hadronic processes is significantly larger than that for soft hadronic processes in dis . ] as a result one can define a diffractive parton density at given @xmath20 as a convolution of the so called pomeron flux factor , @xmath106 and corresponding pomeron parton density for example for gluons : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the maximal value of @xmath94 for which diffractive picture still holds .",
    "the important finding of the hera diffractive studies is that @xmath109 for a wide range of @xmath110 ( similar trend was observed in @xmath111 collisions , see review in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the best global fit of the hera diffractive data @xcite ( fit * d * ) : @xmath112    let us consider probability of diffractive events where the proton remains intact for the hard leading twist processes coupled solely to the gluons . it can be defined as @xmath113 since this definition includes only the leading twist contribution into diffraction it effectively excludes the contribution of small masses to the diffraction which could originate from the higher twist effects . since at small @xmath114 and",
    "@xmath115 few gev@xmath22 the ratio of the quark and gluon densities in a nucleon is @xmath116 , and @xmath109 one obviously expects @xmath117    we can quantitatively estimate @xmath118 using the fit * d * of @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite chooses the initial conditions for the dglap evolution at @xmath119 - see eq.[fitd ] .",
    "we also take @xmath120 which is the highest @xmath94 for which the one has enough sensitivity to the gluon density in the `` pomeron '' .",
    "however for @xmath121 the diffraction probability practically does not depend on the choice of @xmath108 .",
    "we find that @xmath122 which is much larger than @xmath123 .",
    "total probability of rapidity gap which includes double diffractive events ( proton dissociation ) is larger by a factor @xmath124 .",
    "this factor can be estimated assuming the regge factorization for @xmath125 : @xmath126 independent of the diffraction state @xmath127 , and taking into account that the slope of the @xmath72 dependence in the double dissociation should be smaller by about a factor of two due to almost complete disappearance of the proton form factor in the proton vertex .",
    "however the cross section given by the hera groups includes a small contribution of the proton dissociation of about 15% @xcite .",
    "so effectively the scaling factor is smaller @xmath128 .",

    "this suppresses the contribution of large @xmath58 -nonperturbative qcd physics and therefore enhances the contribution of small @xmath58-pqcd physics .    as a result of large absorption for @xmath187 fluctuations near the * average * value of @xmath58",
    "practically do not change the shadowing ( for @xmath188 ) provided @xmath189 is kept fixed . if , for example , we assume that @xmath190 the @xmath191 would change even for heavy nuclei by less than 20% .",
    "besides , as we mentioned in the introduction the diffraction in the gluon induced hard processes without proton break up constitutes about 35% of the events at @xmath8 . large contribution of small @xmath58 in @xmath192 would imply that for scattering in a significant fraction of configurations the gap probability is much smaller than average . hence some configurations would have to generate the gap events with a probability exceeding 35% .",
    "this is one of indications for the problems for the applicability of dglap to describe @xmath160 scattering at hera at low normalization point @xmath193 . at the same time",
    "there is a natural mechanism in pqcd for the generation of a contribution of very small @xmath58 in @xmath192 .",
    "it comes from the qcd evolution .",
    "the partons at given @xmath20 which originated from ancestors at lower resolution scale with @xmath194 do no contribute to diffraction and hence effectively correspond to @xmath195 ( in other words this effect reflects the contribution of small coherence lengths to the small @xmath20 physics due to the qcd evolution ) .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced in the models of qcd evolution with low normalization point like the grv model @xcite .",
    "to estimate the sensitivity to this effect we will use two models .",
    "the first one is the quasieikonal which neglects higher order fluctuations .",
    "the second model is the fluctuation two - component model ( to which we will refer to as a fluctuation model ) which implements an extreme assumption that a fraction @xmath29 of the total cross section at given @xmath20 originates from configurations with small cross section and the rest from the average ones .",
    "the second model is similar to the qcd aligned jet model of @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath196 where @xmath197 is fixed by eq.[seff ] to @xmath198 the requirement that the gap probability for this component ( including dissociation of the nucleon ) does not exceed 50% puts an upper limit on @xmath29 . taking into account uncertainties in the value of the total rapidity gap probability we estimate that @xmath199 .",
    "so we will use @xmath200 in this model . note that for small values of @xmath201 and moderate values of @xmath29 the screening weakly depends on @xmath29 .",
    "hence we will ignore this effect for the quark channel .",
    "for simplicity we will also assume that @xmath202 does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "this should be considered as a rather rough approximation since for small enough @xmath203 one may expect the contribution of small @xmath18 to decrease with decrease of @xmath20 .",
    "also for larger @xmath20 the drop of the parameter @xmath139 can be due to an increase of @xmath29 .",
    "however in this region we anyway have significant uncertainties due to the contribution of @xmath204 .",
    "thus the results in this @xmath20 range can be considered simply as a smooth interpolation between the region of large shadowing and the region where shadowing disappears .",
    "obviously , small @xmath58 s in eq.[fluct ] would give the dominant contribution for @xmath205 .",
    "however for large @xmath139 and @xmath199 for @xmath206 a contribution of the weakly interacting component could at most become comparable to the soft contribution , see figs.3,4 below .      based on the above discussion of the fluctuation effects we adopt the following prescription in the calculation for the gluon and quark nuclear shadowing for @xmath207 :    \\(i ) for @xmath208 we use two models : the quasieikonal model and the fluctuation model with @xmath200 analogous to the ones we used in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the amount of shadowing in the two models is given by g_a(x , q_0)/g_n(x , q_0)_fluct.mod.(_eff(x , q_0)= + + ( 1-)g_a(x , q_0)/g_n(x , q_0)_quasieik.mod .",
    "( _ eff(x , q_0)1- ) ( ii ) to constrain the behavior of the gluon density at @xmath209 in the normalization point we use the analysis of @xcite which indicates that gluons in nuclei carry approximately the same fraction of the momentum as in a free nucleon : _ 0 ^ 1 dx xg_a(x , q^2 ) _ 0 ^ 1 dx xg_n(x , q^2 ) .",
    "[ sumrule ] this allows to estimate the amount of the gluon enhancement at @xmath210 assuming that it should be concentrated at @xmath211 where average longitudinal distances ( the ioffe distances ) contributing to the parton density are comparable to the internucleon distances - this procedure is similar to one we introduced in @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) based on the rational presented above we use the dglap evolution equations to calculate the nuclear shadowing for larger @xmath4 .",
    "since in this paper we are interested primarily in the behavior of the nuclear gluon and quark densities at @xmath212 we are not sensitive to details of the enhancement pattern .",
    "so we do not try to introduce an @xmath54 dependent shape for the enhancement and assume that the enhancement is present for @xmath213 and can be approximated by @xmath214 .",
    "we also do not model small enhancement for @xmath13 and @xmath215 at @xmath216 . in the calculations we use the standard fermi step fit to the nuclear densities : @xmath217 , where @xmath218 .",
    "first , in fig.3 we present a comparison of the gluon shadowing calculated in two models at @xmath57gev and @xmath219 .",
    "one can see that shadowing for @xmath53 is already very significant , though the effect of fluctuations is still small",
    ". with a further increase of @xmath54 the effect of fluctuations becomes larger and it reaches a factor of 1.4 for a@xmath129 200 . for these @xmath54 in the fluctuation model weakly interacting configurations contribute approximately half of the cross section .",
    "note however that we expect that in a more realistic model of fluctuations a relative contribution of these contributions is likely to decrease with decrease of @xmath20 , see discussion in section iv.a .",

    "( variations of the parameter @xmath139 within a factor of @xmath221 allowed by the uncertainties in the value of the gluon diffractive density at @xmath125 lead to the similar variations of @xmath222 at @xmath8 and of @xmath223 $ ] for @xmath213 . )",
    "shadowing decreases with increase of @xmath4 but remains large up to very large @xmath4 .",
    "the shadowing in the charged parton channel is much smaller and rather weakly decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath224 shadowing for @xmath225 first increases with increase of @xmath4 due to a larger shadowing in the gluon channel .",
    "note also that eq.[sumrule ] leads to a rather large enhancement of @xmath191 for @xmath226 .",
    "however the enhancement is rather large already for @xmath227 .",
    "as a result a further growth of the enhancement between carbon and tin is of the order of 10% and it is well consistent with the analysis of the current data in @xcite .",
    "the decrease of shadowing with increase of @xmath4 is due to the feeding of the small @xmath20 by partons which originated from @xmath209 at @xmath96 .",
    "effectively , as we discussed above , the qcd evolution leads to fluctuations in the value of interaction strength due to the mixing of the contributions of small and large @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the use of eq.[fluct ] in the quasieikonal model with @xmath228 defined at a high resolution @xmath4 would lead to an overestimate of the nuclear shadowing since the cross section fluctuations lead to a decrease of the shadowing for the fixed value of @xmath139 , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "note also that it is often stated in the literature that nuclear shadowing for the total cross section of @xmath229 should be practically the same for the real photon and for virtual photons with moderate ( few gev@xmath22 ) virtualities .",
    "however our analysis predicts a significant drop of the nuclear shadowing in the total cross sections of @xmath229 scattering between @xmath230 and @xmath231 due to the strong @xmath4 dependence of the diffraction contribution to @xmath232 .",
    "the results of our calculation using data on the diffraction in the @xmath233 scattering at @xmath234 @xcite and at hera @xcite and a smooth interpolation between two energy ranges is presented in fig.6 . for a rough estimate we use the quasieikonal approximation which leads to a slight overestimate of shadowing for the heavy nuclei .",
    "it is of interest to consider also the structure functions in the limit @xmath4=const , @xmath235 , @xmath205 first analyzed by gribov for @xmath236 @xcite .",
    "it was argued in this paper that in such a limit interactions of all essential configurations in the virtual photon wave function with a nucleus can be treated in the black body ( @xmath31-channel unitarity ) limit .",
    "since in the black disc limit the dispersion over the strengths of interactions can be neglected one finds @xcite f_2a(x , q^2)=r_a^212 ^ 2 _",
    "m_o^2^w^22m_n r_a m^2 ( m^2 ) dm^2 ( m^2+q^2)^2 , and f_l  a(x , q^2)=q^2 r_a^212 ^ 2 _",
    "m_o^2^w^22m_n r_a ( m^2 ) dm^2 ( m^2+q^2)^2 , where @xmath237",
    ".    we can generalize the gribov formulae deduced for the sea quark distribution @xcite to the case of the gluon channel : xg_a(x , q^2)/q^2= _",
    "m_o^2^w^22m_n r_a ( m^2)m^2dm^2 ( m^2+q^2)^2 [ blackdisc ] here @xmath238 is the ratio of the cross section of the gluon hadronic processes initiated by the local operator @xmath239 introduced in @xcite to the perturbative cross section of the annihilation of the gluon source into gluons . for @xmath240 , @xmath241 .",
    "so in the black disk limit xg_a(x , q^2)/q^2= ( w^2q^2 2m_n r_a)(x_0x ) , [ black ] where @xmath242 .",
    "eq.[black ] provides a solution for the problem of the gluon nuclear shadowing in the theoretical limit @xmath4=const , @xmath243 , @xmath205 .",
    "it also illustrates that investigation of the @xmath4 dependence of the nuclear structure functions will provide an effective method to establish whether fluctuations of strengths play a significant role in the gluon structure functions .",
    "it is useful to compare eq.[black ] with the impulse approximation value of @xmath244 .",
    "for example for @xmath245 this equation leads to @xmath246 while the current fits to the nucleon data lead to @xmath247 .",
    "hence the model independent unitarity constrain implies a large gluon shadowing for this kinematics .",
    "this is consistent with our model calculations presented in the previous subsection .",
    "let us now briefly discuss some of the consequences of the found magnitude of the gluon shadowing .    the production of minijets is often considered as an effective mechanism of producing high densities in the head on heavy ion collisions .",
    "however in the lhc kinematics for the central rapidities minijets are produced due to collisions of partons with @xmath248 . for heavy ion collisions @xmath249 and the gluon - gluon collisions are responsible for production of most of the minijets .",
    "therefore the gluon nuclear shadowing would lead to a reduction of the rate of the jet production due to the leading twist mechanism by a large factor up to @xmath250 , see fig.7 where we give results of calculation in the quasieikonal and fluctuation models .",
    "the nuclear gluon shadowing leads to a similar very strong reduction of the heavy onium production in @xmath251 and @xmath63 collisions at lhc energies for @xmath252 and small @xmath253 .    for the central impact parameters the reduction is even larger . using generalized eikonal approximation of eq.[fluct ]",
    "we can calculate also the suppression of the parton densities at a given impact parameter @xmath185 as @xcite : @xmath254 since in the impulse approximation @xmath255 we finally obtain @xmath256 the results of calculation using eq.[fluct1 ] are presented in fig.8 .",
    "so we conclude that the shadowing effects are likely to reduce very substantially the parton densities generated at the first stage of heavy ion collisions at the lhc energies .",
    "however theoretical uncertainties related to the role of point - like configurations lead to rather large uncertainties in the estimate of the suppression for the case of the heavy ion collisions",
    ". hence it would be very important to perform a direct measurement of the gluon nuclear shadowing at hera in this kinematics .",
    "presence of a large gluon shadowing leads to large effects in the diffractive @xmath9 collisions at hera energies .",
    "here we consider the simplest example - coherent diffractive production of vector mesons at large @xmath4 by the longitudinally polarized photons - @xmath257 , and photo(electro ) production of heavy onium states .",
    "since these processes are dominated by production of @xmath258 in a small size configuration one may naively expect that color transparency should hold for such processes and the amplitudes of these processes should be proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "however the qcd factorization for exclusive processes leads to the amplitude of this process been proportional to @xmath259 @xcite . for small @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath72 @xmath260 so we expect that the color transparency regime for @xmath261 ( with a small enhancement at @xmath216 due to enhancement of @xmath259 for these @xmath20 ) would be followed by the color opacity regime for @xmath262 . as an illustration in fig.9 we present the ratio of the cross section of the @xmath10 and @xmath62 production off nuclei with @xmath263 and nucleon calculated under the assumption that the leading twist gives the dominant contribution in these processes .",
    "it is plotted as a function of x and normalized to the value of the ratio at @xmath264 . in the calculation we use the analysis of @xcite which indicates that @xmath265 for @xmath10(@xmath62 ) production .",
    "one can see from the figure that we expect onset of the color opacity regime for @xmath10 starting at @xmath266 .",
    "the color opacity effect remains quite significant for production of @xmath62 .",
    "numerous data on hadron - nucleus scattering at fixed target energies indicate that the multiplcities of the leading hadrons @xmath267 decrease with increase of a. here @xmath268 is the light - cone fraction of the projectile @xmath269 momentum carried by the hadron `` h '' . on the contrary , the qcd factorization theorem for the inclusive hadron production in dis implies that in the case of electron - nucleus scattering no such dependence should be present in the dis case .",
    "this indicates that there should be a interesting transition from the soft physics dominating in the interactions of real photons with nuclei to the hard physics in the inclusive hadron production in the dis kinematics .",
    "it would be manifested in the disappearance of the a - dependence of the leading spectra at large z : @xmath270 at small x a new interesting phenomenon should emerge due to the presence of diffraction and nuclear shadowing for smaller @xmath268 .",
    "indeed , the diffraction originates from the presence in the wave function of @xmath271 of partons with relatively small virtualities which screen the color of the leading parton(partons ) with large virtuality and can rescatter elastically from a target ( several target nucleons in the case of nuclear target ) .",
    "inelastic interactions of these soft partons with several nucleons should lead to a plenty of new revealing phenomena in small @xmath272 dis ea scattering , which resemble hadron - nucleus scattering but with a shift in rapidity from @xmath273 related to the average rapidities of these soft partons .",
    "this shift can be expressed through the average masses of the hadron states produced in the diffraction : @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the soft scale .",
    "partons with these rapidities will interact in multiple collisions and loose their energy leading to a dip in the ratio @xmath276 . at the same time",
    "these multiple interactions should generate a larger multiplcities at smaller rapidities .",
    "application of the agk rules indicates that for @xmath277 , where @xmath278 the hadron multiplicity in the case of nuclei will be enhanced by the factor : @xmath279 at the rapidities close to the nuclear rapidities a further increase of @xmath280 is possible due to formation of hadrons inside the nucleus . a sketch of the expected rapidity dependence of @xmath280 is presented in fig.10 .",
    "one also expects a number of phenomena due to long range correlations in rapidity .",
    "this includes : ( a ) local fluctuations of multiplicity in the central rapidity region , e.g. the observation of a broader distribution of the number of particles per unit rapidity , due to fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations should be larger for the hard processes induced by gluons , for example the direct photon production of two high @xmath253 dijets .",
    "( b ) correlation of the central multiplicity with the multiplicity of neutrons in the forward neutron detector , etc .    another important manifestation of nuclear shadowing is a large probability of diffractive final states for small x. in the case of the generic @xmath281 scattering this probability would reach @xmath282 for @xmath283 @xcite . due to a larger effective cross section of interaction in processes induced by the hard interactions with gluons",
    ", this effect should be even more pronounced in the lepton scattering processes where a hard process corresponds to hard @xmath284 interaction .",
    "hence for example in the charm electroproduction of a heavy nucleus we expect about a half of the events to originate from the coherent diffraction where the nucleus remains intact @xcite .",
    "also one expects more strong filtering out of the gluon dominated diffraction than the diffraction dominated by the coupling to the quarks .",
    "several approaches were developed over last decade to the dynamical calculation of nuclear shadowing phenomenon in dis    first group of approaches is based on the gribov work @xcite which established connection between the diffraction and nuclear shadowing . among these considerations",
    "@xcite the one of @xcite is the most detailed and comes closest to our analysis in the case of @xmath285 .",
    "the analysis is based on the fit to the hera diffractive data on the @xmath286 reaction within the model developed by the authors and a set of assumptions about higher order screening effects which are anyway rather small for @xmath285 .",
    "they demonstrate that the model can well describe the nmc data at @xmath287 and give predictions for the hera kinematics .",
    "the main differences from our approach are the use of the model for diffraction which does not explicitly satisfy the qcd factorization theorem for diffraction in dis and neglect by the effects of enhancement of gluon distributions in nuclei at @xmath216 . besides the gluons appear to play a rather small role in their model of @xmath160 diffraction leading to the expectation of the gluon shadowing smaller than in the case of @xmath285 as compared to the larger shadowing for gluons expected in our analysis .    in the case of hadron - nucleus scattering both total cross section and inelastic diffraction",
    "can be described based on the idea of the fluctuations of the interaction strength in the projectile treating interaction of each component in the eikonal approximation , for the review and references see @xcite .",
    "there are a several models where a similar approach has been applied to the calculation of the nuclear shadowing by introducing the impact parameter @xmath52 virtual photon wave function @xmath288 and introducing the cross section of the @xmath52-n interaction for the fixed @xmath185 , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "so far it was assumed in these models that @xmath289 .",
    "hence the qcd evolution which leads to a fast increase of @xmath290 with incident energy was neglected .",
    "moreover in this approximation shadowing for the small b configurations is a higher twist effect , leading to an expectation of lack of the leading twist shadowing for @xmath291 and lack of gluon shadowing .",
    "another group of approaches uses the infinite momentum picture and treats all the process within the perturbative qcd . to avoid problems with positivity of the cross section for @xmath292 ( see discussion in section xx ) one has to include interactions with @xmath3 nucleons .",
    "the current models which include such interactions ( see @xcite and references therein ) assume that all shadowing is generated perturbatively and do not include information about diffractive processes .",
    "qualitative expectations of these models are a rather large gluon shadowing and significant nonlinear effects in the evolution of the parton densities",
    ". it would be interesting to compare two approaches after the leading twist shadowing effects are implemented and constraints following from the hera diffractive data are taken into account .",
    "we have demonstrated that dominance of gluons in the `` pomeron '' diffractive parton densities leads to a large enhancement of the nuclear gluon shadowing in a wide range of @xmath293 .",
    "gluon shadowing of this magnitude will strongly affect the first stage of the heavy ion collisions at lhc , lead to a number of color opacity phenomena in the hera kinematics for the @xmath9 collisions .",
    "study of the gluon shadowing for heavy nuclei may allow to enhance contribution of the small interaction strengths , allowing to unmask pqcd physics in the @xmath9 collisions at hera .",
    "the studies of coherent diffraction off nuclei and hadron production in the inclusive ea scattering will provide complementary handles for studying the small x dynamics .",

    "<S> the qcd factorization theorem for diffractive processes in dis is used to derive formulae for the leading twist contribution to the nuclear shadowing of parton distributions in the low thickness limit ( due to the coherent projectile ( photon ) interactions with two nucleons ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on the current analyzes of diffraction at hera we find that the average strength of the interactions which govern diffraction in the gluon sector at @xmath0 is @xmath1 mb . </S>",
    "<S> this is three times larger than in the quark sector and suggests that applicability of dglap approximation requires significantly larger @xmath2 in the gluon sector . </S>",
    "<S> we use this information on diffraction to estimate the higher order shadowing terms due to the photon interactions with @xmath3 nucleons which are important for the scattering of heavy nuclei and to calculate nuclear shadowing and @xmath4 dependence of gluon densities . for the heavy nuclei </S>",
    "<S> the amount of the gluon shadowing : @xmath5 is sensitive to the probability of the small size configurations within wave function of the gluon `` partonometer '' at the @xmath2 scale . at this scale for @xmath6 the nonperturbative contribution to the gluon density </S>",
    "<S> is reduced by a factor of @xmath7 at @xmath8 unmasking pqcd physics in the gluon distribution of heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the shadowing of this magnitude would strongly modify the first stage of the heavy ion collisions at the lhc energies , and also would lead to large color opacity effects in @xmath9 collisions at hera energies . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the leading twist contribution to the cross section of the coherent @xmath10 production off @xmath11 nuclei at @xmath12 gev is strongly reduced as compared to the naive color transparency expectations . the gribov black body limit for @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> is extended to the case of the gluon distributions in nuclei and shown to be relevant for the hera kinematics of @xmath9 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> properties of the final states are also briefly discussed . </S>"
