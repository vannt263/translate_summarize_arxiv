    "this can be explained by the different relative magnitude of the hydraulic impedance of the flow paths between the ends of the rod and the side walls and of the direct paths between the rod and the front walls .",
    "finally , the influence of the viscosity has been investigated by comparing the results of experiments using identical parameters but fluids with two different viscosities : @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) and @xmath158 ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the points coincide , which confirms that the drag force is proportional to the viscosity .",
    "the experiments and numerical simulations reported in the present paper have allowed one to determine the influence of confinement effects on the drag force @xmath0 on a static rigid cylinder in a viscous flow inside a rectangular slit .",
    "significantly different results have been obtained in the cases of cylinders with their length parallel and perpendicular to the mean flow , although , in both cases , @xmath0 is proportional to the mean velocity and the viscosity in the range investigated and can , therefore , be characterized by drag coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath40 .    in the parallel case ,",
    "@xmath2 increases linearly with the confinement parameter @xmath18 but does not diverge for @xmath159 ; @xmath40 increases much faster with @xmath30 and diverges near @xmath160 ( due to the blockage of the flow ) when the length @xmath4 of the cylinder is close to the width @xmath17 of the slit . @xmath6",
    "numerical simulations in planes respectively perpendicular ( for @xmath2 ) and parallel ( for @xmath40 and @xmath121 ) to the mean flow reproduce well the results obtained in these two cases . in the perpendicular case analytical model based on the lubrication",
    "also provides a good agreement , still for @xmath121 and for a strong enough confinement ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath161 ) .",
    "when the cylinders are shorter than the width @xmath17 of the slit , a bypass flow appears in the space between the between the edges of the cylinder and the side walls of the slit : this reduces the direct flow in the gap between the front walls and the cylinders .",
    "this effect is particularly strong when the confinement parameter @xmath30 is close to @xmath144 ; it results in a sharp decrease of the coefficient @xmath40 . @xmath11",
    "numerical simulations are needed in order to predict quantitatively this effect .",
    "the present experiments also provided evidence for an inertial lift force in the case of cylinders perpendicular to the flow direction .",
    "this force was observed for reynolds numbers as low as @xmath122 and kept the cylinders in the middle plane of the model : this may explain recent observation of the depinning of fibers trapped inside fractures @xcite .",
    "this observation may be contrasted with numerical simulations  @xcite which predict an opposite effect , _",
    "i.e. _ a force pushing the cylinder towards the walls .",
    "this latter force should however appear only at larger reynolds numbers : further studies are needed to investigate these issues .",
    "the present study dealt only with motionless rigid cylinders inside a viscous flow .",
    "extending these studies to the measurement of forces on moving cylindrical objects , both rigid and flexible , will make the results applicable to the motion of freely swimming microorganisms @xcite .",
    "we thank r. pidoux for realizing the experimental setup and a. aubertin for the data acquisition program .",
    "we also thank s. del pino for providing us with help in the use of freefem3d and j. hinch for helpful suggestions and discussions ."
