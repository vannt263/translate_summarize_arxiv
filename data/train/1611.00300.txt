    "neural models aim at elucidating the grounding architecture that regulates information processing in biological nervous systems @xcite .",
    "the level of abstraction that is accommodated for in the chosen mathematical scheme reflects the specific topic under investigations .",
    "detailed single neurons models can be devised , which account for the sharp changes in the action potential .",
    "the number of neurons in the human cortex is extraordinarily large and for many practical aspects a bottom - up approach that moves from a detailed representation of each individual unit is virtually impracticable .",
    "the physiology of neurons is also quite intricate .",
    "a single neuron receives input from thousand of axon terminals coming from other neurons , but the inherent degree of redundancy contributes to drastically reduce the effective connections to a limited subset .",
    "almost @xmath0 of the neurons are excitatory , whereas the remaining @xmath1 belong to the inhibitory type .",
    "irrespectively of their intimate characteristics , neurons can be pictured as complex switching devices which organize into two macroscopic families of homologous constituents , the activators and inhibitors .",
    "this enables in turn to climb the hierarchy of complexity , and elaborate , to a suitable level of coarse graining , on the interlaced dynamics of homogenous populations of binary neurons .",
    "the celebrated wilson - cowan ( wc ) model @xcite and its further extensions provide an interesting arena to shed light onto the complex dynamics of a multi - species neuronal system .",
    "the model displays elementary limit cycle behavior , mimicking in silico neural oscillations .",
    "stimulus - dependent evoked responses are also predicted , as well as the existence of multiple stable states .",
    "the original wc model is deterministic in nature and the average concentration of active / inactive excitatory / inhibitory neurons appear to be self - consistently ruled by a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "spatially extended versions of the model can be straightforwardly designed which in turn amount to operate with partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "deterministic systems can be analyzed by resorting to a gallery of well - developed tools from the theory of dynamical systems and involving concepts such as trajectories in phase space and attractors of various kinds @xcite .",
    "stochastic systems exhibit an equivalently rich plethora of attributes , ranging from stochastic fluctuations about the deterministic trajectories , rare events which prompt the transitions from one attractor of the deterministic dynamics to another , stationary probability distributions , to mention a few @xcite .",
    "the stochasticity can be externally imposed and hence impact on the deterministic scenario , as an exogenous source of disturbance .",
    "more intriguing is instead the role played by intrinsic perturbation , stemming from the intimate discreteness of the system under scrutiny .",
    "individual - based effects should be unavoidably accommodated for in any sensible model of natural phenomena and yield an endogenous stochastic contribution , which lacks instead under the idealized continuum representation . at first sight",
    "it might appear surprising that stochastic effects are important when the interacting population consist of a large number of individual constituents .",
    "demographic fluctuations can however amplify through resonant effects @xcite and drive the spontaneous emergence of collective macroscopic patterns , both in time  @xcite and in space  @xcite , marking a clear distinction between stochastic and deterministic viewpoints .",
    "endogenous noise is certainly relevant to neural systems @xcite .",
    "channel noise arising from the variability in the opening and closing of a finite number of ion channels , is a microscopic source of intrinsic disturbance . at the population level ,",
    "the instantaneous photograph of the system is drawn by looking at the number of active neurons , which sits on a given patch .",
    "state transition can be assigned to monitor the evolution of the inspected system via a suitably defined master equation , the mean field deterministic picture being eventually recovered in the thermodynamic limit . following these lines of reasoning ,",
    "the wc model has been recently revised under the generalized stochastic angle , so to cast the accent on the specific traits which ultimately emanates from the endogenous component of the noise @xcite .",
    "our paper is positioned in this context @xcite .",
    "we will in particular reformulate the wc dynamics as a simple birth and death stochastic process , with non linear transition rates .",
    "the obtained master equation will be expanded in powers of the inverse population size so to yield an approximate stochastic description for the density of the interacting species .",
    "more specifically , the fluctuating hydrodynamics for the stochastic wc model is represented by a pair of non linear langevin equations , with multiplicative noise .",
    "these latter are shown to provide an adequate description of the original stochastic process , the analysis being specifically targeted to the domain of dynamical bistability . to gain further insight",
    "we will confine ourselves to inspecting the special setting where the bistability solely interests one the two species , the excitatory neurons , while the concentration of the inhibitors converges to a stationary stable fixed point , in the limit of diverging population . working in this setting",
    ", one can effectively reduce the system to just one langevin equation for the excitatory species : an additional contribution appears in the expression for the multiplicative noise , which exemplifies the action exerted by the inhibitory neuron .",
    "the population of inhibitors acts as a source of intrinsic noise , shaking the discrete ensemble of excitators from the _",
    "inside_. interestingly , the perturbation magnifies as @xmath2 , the relative ratio of inhibitory versus excitatory neurons , gets reduced . for actual physiological conditions ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the mechanism here identified is hence potentially relevant .",
    "finite size noise and its inhibitory based component causes an extension of the region deputed to the excitatory bistability , as compared to deterministic predictions .",
    "this contribute in turn to broaden the plasticity of the system and elevate its degree of inherent flexibility .",
    "the analytical tools developed in the early part of the paper are subsequently generalized to the relevant setting where both species can undergo bistable dynamics . a recursive perturbative scheme targeted to such a general scenario",
    "is successfully implemented and tested versus direct numerical simulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the stochastic version of the wilson - cowan model and carry out the analysis that yields to the fluctuating hydrodynamical picture . in section 3",
    ", we will silence the retroaction of the activators on the inhibitors , and assign the parameters so to fall in the region of deterministic bistability for the excitatory species . by linearizing around the fixed point of the inhibitors",
    ", one can reduce the overall dynamics to a non - linear langevin equation for the density of activators : the multiplicative noise incorporates the effect which stems from the population of inhibitors . working in this framework",
    ", one can analytically determine the probability distribution for both species and quantitatively elaborate on their mutualist interdependence .",
    "noise - induced bistability is uncovered , the effect being progressively more evident the smaller the population ratio @xmath2 . building on these premises , in section 4",
    "we generalize the study to the setting where the retroaction of the activators is restored . finally in section 5 we sum up and draw our conclusions .",
    "the wilson - cowan ( wc ) model describes the self - consistent interactions between distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons . we shall hereafter provide a plausible microscopic formulation of the dynamics that eventually converges to the sought wc model in the deterministic limit . as mentioned earlier , by providing a microscopic characterization of the scrutinized dynamics we aim at shedding light onto the role played by finite size fluctuations .",
    "in particular , working under the kramers - moyal approximation we will derive an effective description of the stochastic model in terms of fluctuating hydrodynamical equations .",
    "the model deals with a spatially homogeneous distribution of the interacting entities .",
    "extensions of the proposed scheme which assume the constituents dislocated on the nodes of a complex graph , so to probe the heterogeneity in the emerging distribution , are certainly conceivable .    in the following",
    ", individual excitatory and inhibitory neurons will be respectively identified with the symbols @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "both excitatory and inhibitory neurons can manifest into two distinct states : activated ( @xmath6 ) or quiescent ( @xmath7 ) . to identify to which",

    "the population of inhibitors can be ideally schematized as an additional noise source .",

    "an iterative scheme is in fact devised that builds on the zeroth order approximation described above , and allows us to explain the modifications displayed in the recorded probability distribution function , when a modest feedback of the excitatory on inhibitory neurons is accommodated for . in conclusion we have contributed to the understanding of the stochastic wc model , focusing on a dynamical regime for which the linear noise approximation is manifestly inadequate .",
    "the non linear langevin equations which represent the fluctuating hydrodynamic limit of the original model , can be analytically characterized under suitable operating conditions , so contributing to shed light on the subtle dynamical interplay between distinct families of interacting neurons .",
