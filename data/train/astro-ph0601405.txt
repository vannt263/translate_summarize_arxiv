    "cepheus b ( cep b ) , the hottest co component of the cepheus molecular cloud @xcite , is located near the northwestern edge of the cloud at a distance of 725 pc from the sun @xcite . outside cep b , to the north and west of the cloud , lies the stellar cep ob3 association , composed of two subgroups of stars of different ages with the youngest ( cep ob3b ) lying closer to the molecular cloud @xcite ( see figure [ fig_intro_fig ] ) .",
    "@xcite considered cep ob3 to be a good example of sequential star formation , following the model of @xcite . the interface between the molecular cloud and the ob star association is clearly delineated by the optically visible hii region sharpless 155 ( s 155 ) , where cloud material is ionized and heated by the radiation field of the youngest generation of the cep ob association @xcite . the photodissociation region ( pdr ) at s 155 is favorably oriented to reveal the progression of star formation . as the surface of the cloud is being eroded by the early - type stars , the cloud edge moves eastward across the observer s field of view with new stars emerging from the obscuring molecular cloud .",
    "radio continuum @xcite , far - infrared , co @xcite , and near - infrared studies @xcite reveal a few young stars embedded in the cep b cloud behind the pdr .",
    "sources located on the edge of the molecular cloud and exhibiting high extinction were suggested to represent a third generation of star formation triggered by the hii region shock propagating into the cloud .    the low mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stellar population of cep ob3b can be effectively discriminated using x - ray emission due to the heavy contamination in optical and near - infrared ( onir ) surveys by both foreground and background galactic field stars .",
    "x - ray surveys are complementary to onir surveys because they trace magnetic activity ( mainly plasma heated in violent magnetic reconnection flares ) rather than photospheric or circumstellar disk blackbody emission , and pms x - ray emission is elevated @xmath3 above main sequence ( ms ) levels @xcite .",

    "one hundred and eight sources with @xmath31 have median @xmath32 ( @xmath33 detection threshold of _ pwdetect _ ) .",
    "the _ ae _ package provides a variety of source characteristics including celestial position , off - axis angle , net and background counts within the psf - based extraction area , source significance assuming poisson statistics , effective exposure ( corrected for telescope vignetting , satellite dithering , and bad ccd pixels ) , median energy after background subtraction , a variability indicator extracted from the one - sided kolmogorov - smirnov statistics , and occasional anomalies related to chip gap or field edge positions .",
    "these are all reported in table [ tbl_bsp ] ; see @xcite for a fuller description of these quantities .",
    "an automated cross - correlation between the _ chandra _ source positions and 2mass nir catalogs was made using a search radius of @xmath34 within @xmath35 of the acis field center , and a search radius of @xmath36 in the outer regions of the field where the _ chandra _ psf deteriorates .",

    "subgroups of different ages may exist , each with different xlf and imf characteristics .",
    "the xlfs are relatively insensitive to these age effects ; between 1 and 10 myr , only a slight decay ( roughly 0.3 in @xmath87 ) is found in the coup population @xcite .",
    "an older assumed age will have a bigger effect on the klf .",
    "figure [ imf2_fig]b summarizes a klf analysis similar to that in ",

    "the excess of lower mass stars over the onc imf then mostly disappears .",
    "however , a younger age for cep ob3b has two advantages : the unusual inferred imf agrees with the unusual observed xlf (  [ xlf_sub.sec ] ) , which is insensitive to age assumptions ; and the shape of the background - subtracted klf more closely agrees with the imf of the x - ray detected population for 1 myr compared to 3 myr ( figure [ imf2_fig ] ) .",
    "an argument in favor of the older age can be seen in figure [ imf2_fig]b : the background - subtracted klf more closely matches the galactic field imf ( grey line ) than in the case of 1 myr .",
    "we thus emerge with a clear determination that the xlfs of cep ob3b and the onc differ , but without a clear interpretation of this effect",

    "followup optical photometry and spectroscopy of 321 cep ob3b x - ray sources would assist in unravelling these possibilities , as individual ( rather than statistical ) masses and ages can be directly estimated on the hertzsprung - russell diagram .    if we assume that the 1 myr ages are correct , then the inferred imf difference may be related to differences between the physical processes of star formation in the cep b and orion molecular clouds .",

    "most of the detected x - ray sources occupy the locus of low - mass pms stars with a typical absorption of @xmath55 mag ( assuming age of @xmath48 myr ) , but as many as 60 sources with nir counterparts , residing close to / in the molecular cloud , have even much higher absorptions up to @xmath314 mag",
    "twenty four unidentified hard x - ray sources are classified as possible extragalactic contaminants ( table [ tbl_spe ] , ` a ' ) .",
    "though some of them still may be embedded members of the cloud , about 70% percent of them are probably true agns , as argued by a detailed simulation of the extragalactic background population , including instrumental background and local ( cepheus ) plus large scale galactic absorptions . through careful simulations of x - ray emission from the galactic foreground and background populations , employing a stellar population synthesis model of the galactic disk , and through the inspection of nir colors of x - ray detected sources we expect to have no more than a few galactic background stars and we suggest 13 field star candidates ( table [ tbl_spe ] , ` f ' ) .",
    "\\3 . in order to obtain a reliable x - ray luminosity function of the detected pms stars we determine source x - ray fluxes based on knowledge of their nir absorptions and x - ray median energies .",

    "this may be caused by a nonstandard imf in cep ob3b with an excess of @xmath1 m@xmath2 stars if the cluster age is @xmath48 myr .",
    "this excess also appears in the independently derived klf based on 2mass source counts ( after an uncertain subtraction of background counts from two control fields ) which show more @xmath316 stars than expected from a standard imf .",
    "however , the discrepancy may also be attributed to different ages and star formation histories for the cep ob3b and onc clusters .",
