    "it is clear that gpds parameterize many hadronic property at the same time .",
    "the fact that they are connected to so many measurable quantities is not only the reason why they are of such central importance for hadron structure but at they same time provides a realistic hope that a combination of data from different classes of experiments together with enough theoretical constraints will eventually suffice to pin down these observables .",

    "the rest of the paper will be devoted to discussing this connection and and illustrating its consequences . before doing so , it is worthwhile to discuss what kind of result one may anticipate .",
    "first of all , since a measurement of a parton distribution corresponds to a measurement of the momentum component of partons in the direction of the target s momentum .",
    "because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , one should therefore not expect to be able to measure the ` longitudinal ' position of partons .",

    "the fact that the impact parameter dependent parton distributions have a density interpretation is very important because it shows that they have a physical significance beyond being the fourier transforms of gpds !",

    "since such a procedure is clearly model dependent , it is desirable to use as many general theoretical constraints as possible in order to minimize the dependence on specific model features .",
    "the results from this paper can be used to provide some general theoretical constraints as we will discuss in the following .",
    "first of all , in order to be consistent with the above positivity constraints [ ( [ eq : dens2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dens3 ] ) ] , all realistic anstze for @xmath39 should satisfy d^2**_e^-i*b _ * _ h_q(x,0,-**_^2 ) & & 0 x>0 + d^2**_e^-i*b _ * _ h_q(x,0,-**_^2 ) & & 0 x<0 for any value of @xmath47 and any value of @xmath4 .",
    "of course , many anstze , especially those with a gaussian @xmath73 dependence , are already consistent with these new constraints .",
    "however , additional constraints arise due to the fact that gpds can be linked to impact parameter dependent pdfs .",
    "first of all , the mere fact that the impact parameter dependent pdfs are measured with respect to the transverse center of momentum @xmath74 implies that @xmath39 should become @xmath73-independent as @xmath75 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is very simple : the transverse center of momentum of a hadron is defined as the weighted average of transverse positions of all partons in the hadron , where the weight factors are the momentum fractions carried by each parton . since @xmath4 in @xmath39 is the momentum fraction carried by the active quark , this active quark carries all the momentum of the hadron when one takes @xmath75 and therefore the contribution from all partons other than the active quark in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rperp ] ) becomes negligible .",
    "hence the active quark is always very close to the transverse center of momentum when @xmath75 and the impact parameter dependent pdf @xmath31 has a very peaked ` transverse profile ' in this limit .",
    "more precisely , the transverse width of the impact parameter dependent pdf r_^2(x ) should vanish as @xmath75.-mesons , where the @xmath58 quark does not recoil very much and therefore has a very localized distribution in position space .",
    "] thus @xmath76 ( being the fourier transform of @xmath31 ) should become independent of @xmath77 as @xmath75 .",
    "we should emphasize that this behavior is consistent with the feynman picture for hadron form factors near @xmath78 @xcite . in this picture , configurations where one parton carries @xmath79 and all others",
    "are ` wee ' can be easily scattered elastically ( by striking the parton with @xmath79 ) since the wee partons do not have a direction and thus can be easily ` turned around ' . therefore , in the feynman picture , contributions to the form factor where the active quark carries a larger fraction of the hadron s total momentum tend to have a weaker @xmath73 dependence .    the constraint that @xmath39 should become @xmath73 independent as @xmath75 rules out factorized anstze of the form h_q(x,0,t",
    ") = q(x ) f(t ) , since they do not become @xmath73 independent near @xmath78 .",
    "the position space interpretation of gpds also allows one to put constraints on the behavior near @xmath80 .",
    "space time descriptions of hadron structure @xcite suggest that the transverse size of hadrons should grow like @xmath81 near @xmath80 , where @xmath82 is some constant .",
    "in fact , a more rapid growth ( e.g. power law ) of the transverse size for @xmath83 would also lead to power law growth of total cross sections and would therefore lead to violations of unitarity bounds .",
    "because of the connection between the transverse size and the slope of @xmath39 , this result implies for example that an ansatz like h_q(x,0,-**_^2 ) = q(x ) e^-a**_^2 , [ eq : gauss ] is inconsistent with abovementioned constraints about the transverse size of hadrons near @xmath80 .",
    ", this ansatz may nevertheless be a useful approximation to the actual behavior and this ansatz also satisfies our above constraint that @xmath39 should become @xmath73 independent near @xmath78 . ]",
    "an improved gaussian ansatz for @xmath76 , which is consistent with both the @xmath75 and @xmath83 constraints , is given by h_q(x,0,-**_^2 ) = q(x ) e^-a**_^2 [ eq : log1 ] or h_q(x,0,-**_^2 ) = q(x ) e^-a**_^2(1-x ) .",

    "although the above discussion may appear purely academic at the present stage , where very little information on gpds exists , it may still have some phenomenological significance because in compton scattering the contributions from the small @xmath4 region are enhanced due to the factor @xmath87 ( [ eq : gff ] ) . the ansatz in eq .",
