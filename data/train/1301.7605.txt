    "identification of the recently observed @xcite scalar field at the lhc with the higgs would cast a long shadow on gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the well known phenomenon that in pure gauge mediation models , mixing in the scalar sector is minimum .",
    "this implies that in order to raise the higgs mass to @xmath2 gev one needs stop masses at several tev , castigating these models to an _ unnatural _ existence with bleak chances to be probed at collider experiments like the lhc .    a resolution of this predicament is to consider direct coupling between the messenger and matter fields or models with gauge messengers",
    "these scenarios can in principle generate a sizable trilinear coupling that can boost the higgs mass given by , @xmath3 \\ ,   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , while keeping the scalar spectrum within the range of interest for collider physics . in case of gauge messengers",
    "the trilinear couplings are proportional to gauge charges .",
    "however realistic models recently studied in @xcite predict a relatively heavy spectrum . in this paper",
    "we will consider models of direct messenger - matter interactions that can lead to relatively large trilinear coupling and a considerably light soft spectrum making them more pleasing from a fine - tuning point of view and more interesting phenomenologically .",
    "these interaction terms generally lead to new contributions to the scalar masses , thus producing a correlated perturbation of the pure gauge mediation soft spectrum .",
    "the strength of the interaction and hence the size of the trilinear coupling is principally constrained from the considerations to keep the scalar masses non - tachyonic and achieve radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) .",
    "also a cause for concern are the complications in the flavor sector @xcite .",
    "these tend to push the messenger scale upward into regions where the gravitino mass goes beyond @xmath6 sub - kev range putting unfavorable upper bounds on the reheating temperature inviting strong constraints from bbn @xcite .",
    "the flavor constraints are severe for the first two generations of fermions and can be minimized by considering that the messengers preferentially couple to the third generation , which is relevant for enhancing the higgs mass .",
    "this can be ensured by imposing judiciously chosen flavor symmetries .",
    "several models of gmsb augmented with messenger - matter interactions to alleviate the problem with the heavy higgs have been suggested in the literature .",
    "the basic idea being the coupling of the messengers to one of the @xmath7 mssm multiplets , generating a sizable @xmath8 at the messenger scale .",
    "possible interaction terms in a given scenario get determined by the content and quantum numbers of the messenger sector . in this paper",
    "we make a systematic study of messenger - matter interactions , possible within a well defined framework . as an organizing strategy we consider the messengers as vector pairs embedded in one of the simpler representations of the gut group su(5 ) .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to messengers in the 1 , 5 and 10 dimensional representations of su(5 ) or an admixture .",
    "this ensures that the perturbative unification of gauge coupling is not ruined due to introduction of these additional fields @xcite .",
    "for the first time we make a quantitative comparison of various models , including some that have been discussed in the literature and some entirely new scenarios , in term of their effectiveness to raise the higgs mass without the usual pitfall of large scalar masses . in order to make the comparison , we numerically scan all parameters of every given model over a suitable range and project the allowed regions on a common parameter space .",
    "this allows us to make precise statements about scenarios preferred by the recent data on the _ supposed _ higgs mass .    for simplicity ,",
    "in our study we will not attempt to model the hidden sector and simply assume supersymmetry is broken by the vev of a spurion field which couples to the messengers .",
    "the crucial point would be that the messengers other than having usual gauge couplings to the mssm sector , now also couple directly through the superpotential . in this paper",
    ", we enumerate possible messenger - matter interaction terms allowed by a given messenger sector .",
    "for each scenario we compute the contributions of these new terms to the scalar masses at one and two loop order .",
    "we find that the one loop contributions are always tachyonic but they are suppressed by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are messenger scale and supersymmetry breaking scale respectively .",
    "thus for a given @xmath12 or soft scalar mass , this contribution decouples as the scale of supersymmetry breaking is increased .",
    "the sign of the two loop contribution is model dependent , however there is no suppression from the supersymmetry breaking scale . in most regions of the parameter space",
    "this becomes the dominant contribution from the new terms .",
    "one loop renormalization group equations are used to run these soft parameters down from the scale of supersymmetry breaking to the weak scale and the sparticle spectrum is generated .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our organizing principle and enumerate the possible interaction terms . in section 3",
    "we compute the soft masses and trilinear couplings for the different models . in section 4",
    "we describe our numerical procedure and present our results comparing the models .",
    "finally we conclude .",
    "in this section , we collect the possible interactions between the messenger sector and the mssm fields . a useful way to organize these is to consider the fields embedded in a representation of some gut group like su(5 ) . as usual",
    ", the mssm fields can be embedded into representations of the su(5 ) group as follows , @xmath13    the messenger fields are in a vector like pair embedded in 1 , 5 , 10 and their conjugate representations of su(5 ) . for the rest of this paper",
    "we use the following nomenclature for the messenger sector , @xmath14 where the subscript @xmath15 identifies the messenger fields .",
    "technically the singlet is not a valid gauge messenger in the usual sense .",
    "however , it can couple directly to the visible sector through superpotential terms and thus will be considered in the following discussion . within this framework for the messenger and the matter sectors , it is simple to write down all the possible su(5 ) invariants that can be constructed : @xmath16 note that the invariants @xmath17 and @xmath18 will not give @xmath8 hence will not be considered further . the possibility that the messenger sector is composed of fields in different representation can also exist . in this case",
    "we expect the usual invariants listed above should reappear .",
    "the new possible invariants are given below , @xmath19 again we find that terms like @xmath20 and @xmath21 will not give @xmath22 to keep the discussion tractable we will utilize prudently chosen flavor symmetries to suppress interaction terms other than the ones listed above .    as emphasized earlier a host of issues with flavor including fcnc can be controlled if we consider scenarios where the messenger sector preferentially couples to the third generation multiplet . an economical proposition is to connect this to the flavor symmetry that is responsible for the hierarchy in measured mass of the standard model fermions@xcite .",
    "for example one can consider the froggatt - nielsen @xcite framework that necessitates an @xmath23 flavor symmetry group , under which the mssm chiral multiplets may be charged .",
    "this flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken at some high scale @xmath24 by the vev of the flavon field @xmath25 , with a conventionally assigned flavor charge @xmath26 . for this choice , operators with a negative @xmath23 charge mismatch ( @xmath27 )",
    "are considered absent in the effective theory . however , if @xmath28 for any superpotential term then it is suppressed by the usual froggatt - nielsen factor @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "flavor symmetries of this kind can successfully explain observed fermion mass matrices within present experimental uncertainties . interestingly the anomalous nature of the symmetry can motivate compensatory exotic particles that can be probed at present and future collider experiments @xcite , thus providing an handle to probe the existence of these flavor structures .",
    "together with r - parity assignments this will be enough to determine the interaction terms uniquely for most of the scenarios that will be explored in this paper .",
    "the usual charges for the mssm and the flavon multiplets are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "another symmetry that is usually useful in safely segregating the messenger and visible sectors in usual gmsb models is the messenger parity @xcite under which all the messenger multiplets are assumed odd while the mssm multiplets are considered even .",
    "one can classify the interaction terms introduced above into two categories with different implications for possible messenger parities . in models where the interaction term involves two messenger multiplets and one mssm multiplet",
    "one can impose messenger parity consistently .",
    "this immediately forbids mass mixing terms between the messenger and matter multiplets at all orders of the perturbation theory . while for models where the interaction term involves one messenger multiplet and two mssm multiplets , a consistent messenger parity can not be constructed .",
    "this will lead to messenger - matter mixing either at tree level or at higher orders , leading to non - trivial contributions to the soft spectrum .",
    "we will discuss the consequences of this for specific scenarios in the next section .    .",
    "u(1 ) flavor symmetry and the r - parity charges of different mssm multiplets .",
    "the subscripts denote the flavor index .",
    "values @xmath31 approximately explain the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "the charge assignment for the mssm multiplets will remain same throughout the paper . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly from this models 5 , 7 , 9 , and 10 can be identified as most promising in terms of boosting the higgs mass to experimentally favored range without admitting too much fine - tuning . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the allowed region for the models 5 , 7 , 9 and 10 where the higgs mass is between @xmath32 gev , in the parameter space of the lightest stop and the gluino masses . these plots can be directly translated to a measure of naturalness of the models by relating them to the _ barbieri - giudice _",
    "@xcite fine - tuning parameter using the approximate relation @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 $ ] , @xmath35 is the top yukawa coupling and @xmath36 .",
    "a recent study in pure mgmsb models @xcite indicates that for a single messenger pair in @xmath37 of su(5 ) requires a stop mass beyond @xmath38 tev to obtain a @xmath39 gev higgs that tantamount to a considerable fine - tuning .",
    "we note that the benchmark points given in table  [ table3 ] implies an improvement in the fine - tuning at @xmath40 thus an order of magnitude improvement in fine - tuning can be achieved through the messenger - matter interactions discussed in this paper .    within the framework of gmsb models ,",
    "the collider constraints on the sparticle masses are rather model sensitive , crucially depending on the nlsp @xcite .",
    "interestingly we observe that among the preferred models only one has a nutralino nlsp while the rest have slepton nlsps rate through loop contributions in the large @xmath41 regime @xcite and can explain the slight excess over sm prediction indicated by the present experimental data .",
    "the search strategies and hence the consequent constrains are different for the two scenarios . in case of a bino nlsp one",
    "expects a @xmath42 signal , the limits were discussed in a fairly model independent manner through _ simplified models _ in @xcite .",
    "the limits presented for the natural susy ( light stop ) scenario indicate @xmath43 tev and @xmath44 gev .",
    "subsequent updates @xcite marginally enhance the exclusion on the gluino .",
    "the models with slepton nlsp are constrained from @xmath45 and @xmath46 searches .",
    "conservative limits around @xmath47 gev were suggested in @xcite .",
    "recent updates from the cms , see for example @xcite and the atlas , see @xcite will certainly increase this bound .",
    "however we could not find a comprehensive model independent study of this scenario in terms of simplified models in the literature .    in table",
    "[ table3 ] we present indicative benchmark points for the four preferred models .",
    "clearly the limits on the neutralino nlsp scenario already push the fine - tuning of the models beyond 10 .",
    "let us also point out that recent study on the gravitino phenomenology indicates that a cosmologically safe upper limit gravitino mass might be as low as 16 ev @xcite .",
    "the gravitino mass is given by the usual relation @xmath48 where @xmath11 and @xmath49 are defined in eq .",
    "[ master_lang ] and @xmath50 is the planck mass . comparing with the gaugino masses given in eq .",
    "[ usual ] we see that , @xmath51 where @xmath10,@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the messenger scale , messenger multiplicity and the dynkin index respectively .",
    "it is clear that the restrictive limits from the gravitino mass can be accommodated in models with higher messenger multiplicity and/or high dynkin index .",
    "it might be expected that the large gravitino mass ( e.g. the benchmark point for model 5 in table  [ table3 ] ) for models with low dynkin index can be handled by considering higher messenger multiplicity .",
    "a detailed study of the effect of varying the number of messengers is beyond the scope of this paper .    note that most of the discussion in this paper corresponds to this light gravitino scenario .",
    "however as the gravitino mass crosses @xmath54 the nlsp becomes increasingly stable leading to stronger constraints from searches for long living particles at the lhc .",
    "for example a quasi - stable stau has the constraints @xmath55 gev on its mass @xcite .",
    "consequently this would rule out most of the low fine - tuned regions in our models providing an added motivation to consider low scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "supersymmetric scenarios with viable uv complete supersymmetry breaking sectors are severely challenged by the measured higgs mass at the lhc .",
    "several extension of these models that conjecture the existence of extra exotic particles have been proposed in the literature to address this issue @xcite . within gauge mediated models one can evade these constraints economically , by considering messenger - matter interactions .",
    "some of these models have also been studied in the recent past , . in the present paper",
    "we study a class of these models that can be embedded in su(5 ) gut group .",
    "we find r - parity and flavor symmetries provide an organized way to study these models .",
    "interestingly the flavor symmetry can be tied to the origin of the observed sm fermion masses and mixing through a froggatt - nielsen like framework .",
    "we construct all the possible invariant terms with the messengers in the 1 , 5 and 10 dimensional representations of the su(5 ) group . some models or their close variants studied in the literature show up naturally within this framework while a whole set of new models are predicted .",
    "however it should be emphasized that the choice of flavor symmetries presented here is not unique .",
    "they are presented mostly in the spirit of proof of principle .",
    "it might as well be that the form of the interaction superpotential discussed here arises from a completely different underlying flavor structure .",
    "nevertheless the phenomenological features studied in the second half of the paper are independent of these assumptions .",
    "a detailed numerical study of the relevant parameter space of the different scenarios is carried out to compare these models .",
    "we identify models that can effectively raise the higgs mass to the favoured range without admitting too much fine - tuning .",
    "we find many of the generic and specific susy searches at lhc imply considerable constraints on these models .",
    "incidentally we observe that all but one of the preferred models have a slepton nlsp .",
    "however we could not locate a detailed model independent study of the lhc constraints on this scenario in the literature .",
    "most studies are restricted to benchmark points or related to details of the entire spectrum . considering that many other possible _ natural _ susy models within the context of gmsb could lead to a slepton nlsp , a detailed study of this scenario is highly anticipated .",
