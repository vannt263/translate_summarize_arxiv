    "one of the main driving forces for the evolution of our universe are nuclear processes .",
    "these nuclear processes are responsible for the energy production in stars as well as for the production of the elements in our universe .",
    "the process of the creation of the elements is called nucleosynthesis .",
    "we have three different scenarios , where nucleosynthesis occurs : in the big bang ( primordial nucleosynthesis ) , in interstellar space ( interstellar nucleosynthesis ) and in stars ( stellar nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "the result of nucleosynthesis is reflected today by the observed elemental abundances in different objects ( sun and other stars , planets , meteorites , interstellar matter ,  ) .",
    "the light elements from hydrogen to lithium with mass numbers @xmath7 to @xmath8 were mainly synthesized in primordial nucleosynthesis . in interstellar nucleosynthesis",
    "primarily elements from lithium to boron with mass numbers @xmath9 to @xmath10 were produced .",
    "finally , all the heavier elements from carbon to uranium ( in the astrophysical jargon these elements are called metals ) with mass numbers @xmath11 to @xmath12 were created in stellar nucleosynthesis . even though the heavier elements amount to",
    "about only 1% of the total observed abundance they are obviously indispensable for our environmemt . without stellar nucleosynthesis",
    "our universe would be a boring place with the two gases hydrogen and helium ( with a negligible amount of lithium , beryllium and boron ) and without all the elements necessary for the existence of life .",
    "one of the essential inputs for the investigation of different astrophysical scenarios for nucleosynthesis are cross sections , astrophysical s  factors and reaction rates of nuclear reactions as well as half lives and decay rates of nuclear decays .",
    "these quantities are determined using different experimental facilities ( accelerators , reactors ,  ) . however , in many cases it is not possible to obtain the needed cross sections directly from experiments .",
    "this is due to the fact that astrophysically relevant reactions take place mainly at thermonuclear energies .",
    "these energies are mostly well below the coulomb and/or centrifugal barrier , and in this region the cross sections are often too small for experimental determination .",
    "furthermore , in nucleosynthesis often radioactive nuclei are involved , for which experimental information is only scarcely available . for nuclei",
    "far  off stability often experimental information is not attainable at all .    in the next section a short introduction to nucleosynthesis",
    "is given emphasizing those astrophysical scenarios , where light nuclei are involved and methods developed in the few  body field could be applied . in sect .",
    "3 we show as an example for an application of few  body calculations for astrophysically relevant nuclear reactions the two  step process @xmath0he(2n,@xmath1)@xmath2he .",
    "this reaction involves also the halo nucleus @xmath2he . in the last section",
    "we calculate the reaction rate for this reaction as well as other two  step reactions involving halo nuclei , like @xmath2he(2n,@xmath1)@xmath4he and @xmath5li(2n,@xmath1)@xmath6li , using the simpler direct  capture ( dc ) model .",
    "in this section we only can give a short introduction to nucleosynthesis .",
    "there are many textbooks where this subject can be found in more detail ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis took place as the cooling early universe reached a temperature of about @xmath13k about three minutes after the big bang . before that time",
    "the temperature was high enough that formed deuterons were immediately again destroyed through photodisintegration . from primordial nucleosynthesis calaculations",
    "we can deduce abundance ratios of the light stable nuclides @xmath14h , @xmath15h , @xmath16he , @xmath0he , @xmath2li and @xmath17li .",
    "even some primordial abundance ratios may be altered somewhat by interstellar and stellar nucleosynthesis , the agreement between the abundances obtained from primordial nucleosynthesis with the observed abundances is remarkable .    in interstellar nucleosynthesis",
    "the nuclides @xmath2li , @xmath17li , @xmath5be , @xmath18b and @xmath6b are produced . in this scenario",
    "high  energy ( larger than about 1gev ) cosmic rays hit interstellar matter and create through spallation processes the above nuclei .",
    "the results for the parameters of the cross sections for the second step and the reaction rates are also shown in table  [ t5 ] .",
    "the reaction rate for @xmath2he(2n,@xmath1)@xmath4he is at @xmath19 about a factor 40 larger than for @xmath0he(2n,@xmath1)@xmath2he .",
    "very similar results for the reaction rate of @xmath0he(2n,@xmath1)@xmath2he have also been obtained in another dc calculation by grres et al .",
    "@xcite . however , our reaction rate for @xmath2he(2n,@xmath1)@xmath4he is more than a factor 10 larger than in ref .",
    "@xcite , mainly because we used a larger spectroscopic factor .",
    "the reaction rate for @xmath5li(2n,@xmath1)@xmath6li ( table  [ t5 ] ) is at @xmath19 almost a factor two enhanced compared to @xmath0he(2n,@xmath1)@xmath2he ( table  [ t4 ] ) , even though the total q  value for the li ",
    "reaction is a factor three smaller ( table  [ t3 ] ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the more pronounced halo structure of the li  nuclei as compared to the he  nuclei .",
    "the authors are indebted to i.j .",
