    "the quantum rabi model @xcite describes the interaction between a bosonic mode and a two  level system  probably the simplest interaction between light and matter .",
    "its semiclassical form was first introduced by rabi in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite . in 1963 ,",
    "jaynes and cummings @xcite found its application in describing the interaction between a two - level molecular and a single mode photon field . with the developments of experiments ,",
    "many systems can be described by this model in quantum optics @xcite , condensed matter @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , circuit qed @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , trapped ions @xcite and so on . although this model takes a very simple form , its analytical solution was not so easy to obtain , so various approximations were made , one of which is the famous `` rotating  wave approximation '' @xcite . in 2011 , its solution was analytically found by braak @xcite in the bargmann space @xcite .",
    "it can describe the ultrastrong qubit - photon coupling regime , which has been reached in recent circuit qed experiments @xcite , where the `` rotating wave approximation '' breaks down .",
    "after that , various researches are done to the full rabi hamiltonian , including recovering the solution of the rabi model @xcite , real - time dynamics @xcite , the solution of the two - qubit rabi hamiltonian @xcite , dynamical correlation functions @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "two - qubit system is basic and fundamental to the construction of the universal quantum gate .",
    "various qubit - qubit interactions are applied to generate qubit - qubit entanglement and realize quantum computation @xcite , one of which is mediated by a resonant cavity , described by the two - qubit quantum rabi model @xcite . in this case , the ultrafast two - qubit quantum gate can be constructed in the ultrafast qubit - photon coupling regime @xcite . besides , the distant qubits can be coupled through a resonant cavity and the coherent quantum state storage and transfer can be realized @xcite . working for the whole qubit - photon coupling regime , the two - qubit quantum rabi model can be applied in many systems in quantum optics @xcite and quantum information @xcite .",
    "its analytical solution was obtained in @xcite by means of bargmann space approach , and also in @xcite with extended coherent states representation .",
    "one interesting result is that there exist coupling - dependent eigenstates in the whole coupling regime with constant eigenenergy  reminiscent of `` dark states '' , but they are coupling - dependent and the photon number is bounded from above at @xmath0 , which is novel and interesting . besides , there are quasi - exact solutions with finite photon numbers @xmath4 , which are not presented in the one - qubit rabi model .",
    "these special solutions may have some interesting application , however , the algebraic structure behind the possibility of these special solutions needs to be clarified .    in this paper , we have clarified the algebraic structure of the two - qubit quantum rabi model for its special quasi - exact solutions with finite photon numbers found in @xcite . by analyzing the hamiltonian in the photon number space , we find the condition for closed subspace , i.e. the algebraic structure are related with the permutation symmetry of the qubit - photon coupling terms for the two qubits .",
    "even more interestingly , the quasi - exact solution with at most @xmath0 photon exists in the whole coupling regime with constant eigenenergy equal to single photon energy @xmath1 , which can be clearly found from the algebraic structure .",
    "these eigenstates are partly like `` dark states '' , but are coupling dependent and the photon number is bounded from above , so they may have some interesting . according to the algebraic structure of the two - qubit quantum rabi model , we may conjecture there are similar `` dark states''like solutions to those models with homogenous qubits - photon coupling terms .",
    "for example , we consider the two - qubit jaynes - cummings model @xcite , which is commonly applied for simplicity in the weak coupling regime @xcite . very interestingly , under similar condition",
    ", we find many `` dark states''like eigenstates , existing in the whole coupling regime with constant eigenenergy @xmath5 , one of which is also the eigenstate of the two - qubit rabi model .",
    "since the jaynes - cumming model is simper than the rabi model , these eigenstates may provide some interesting application easier . on the other hand",
    ", we analytically retrieve the solution of the two - qubit quantum rabi model , using bogoliubov operators . with this more physical and straightforward method",
    ", we find a way to obtain its solution by convergent power series , so that we can make reasonable cutoff in practical calculation and the solution can reach arbitrary accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we clarify the algebraic structure behind the possibility of quasi - exact solutions with finite photon numbers obtained in @xcite and also find the special `` dark states''like solutions of the two - qubit jaynes - cummings model . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we analytically retrieve the solution of the two - qubit quantum rabi model using bogoliubov operators .",
    "finally , we make some conclusions in section [ s4 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two - qubit quantum rabi model reads ( @xmath6 ) @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the single mode photon creation and annihilation operators with frequency @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 are the energy level splittings of the two qubits . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the qubit - photon coupling constants for the two qubits respectively",
    ". there are quasi - exact solutions with finite photon numbers @xmath4 obtained by analyzing the recurrence relation of the coefficients in @xcite .",
    "however , the algebraic structure behind the possibility of these novel exceptional solutions needs to be clarified .",
    "quasi - exact solutions with finite photon numbers @xmath4 correspond to the existence of closed subspace in the photon number representation , i.e. the algebraic structure . here",
    "we demonstrate the closed subspace are related with the permutation symmetry of the qubit - photon coupling terms by analyzing the structure of the hamiltonian in the photon number space . @xmath16 ( [ gq ] ) process a @xmath17 symmetry with the transformation @xmath18 . taking odd parity for example ,",
    "supposing the initial state @xmath19 is in a subspace formed by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath4 are even , then the hamiltonian reads ( @xmath10 is set to @xmath0 ) @xmath22 if for @xmath23 , the coefficients of @xmath24 and @xmath25 equal to @xmath26 , then this subspace is closed . for the first case ,",
    "we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coefficients of @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . from equations ( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) and @xmath32",
    ", we obtain @xmath33 and @xmath34 . by using the time - independent schdinger equation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath35 so that @xmath36 for the special case @xmath37 and @xmath38 , there is a invariant subspace formed by @xmath39 , and the eigenstate is @xmath40 which is the famous `` dark state '' @xcite , where the spin singlet is decoupled from the photon field .",
    "if @xmath41 , considering the coefficient of @xmath25 must be @xmath26 , it is required that @xmath42 , which contradicts with @xmath43 , so that the only possible choice is @xmath44 .",
    "now we have obtained a closed subspace ( algebraic structure ) formed by @xmath45 then by using the time - independent schdinger equation , we can obtain quasi - exact solutions with finite photon number @xmath4 for certain choice of parameters @xmath46 ,  @xmath47 ,  and @xmath48 .",
    "for example , if @xmath49 , the determinant of the matrix @xmath50 must equal to @xmath26 , which gives @xmath51=0.\\ ] ]    this is the condition for an odd parity solution with photon number bounded from above at @xmath49 , coinciding with @xcite , which depends on @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath52 .",
    "so now , we have found the algebraic structure and quasi - exact solutions with finite photon numbers @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , it is very interesting for the solution with @xmath53 , whose existing condition is independent of @xmath52 .",
    "the closed subspace is formed by @xmath54 , and the condition is @xmath55 which gives @xmath56=0,\\ ] ] which is independent of @xmath52 , coinciding with @xcite .",
    "so for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we obtain two quasi - exact solutions @xmath59 respectively , where @xmath60 .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath33 , the numerical spectrum of the two - qubit quantum rabi model is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the horizontal line at @xmath63 corresponds to the special eigenstate @xmath64 ( equation ( [ dk2 ] ) ) .",
    "this eigenstate exists in the whole coupling regime with constant eigenenergy , like `` dark states '' , but are coupling dependent , and with at most @xmath0 photon .    ,  @xmath62 ,  @xmath65 ,  @xmath66 ,  @xmath67 . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are solutions with even and odd parity respectively.[figure1],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for even parity , similarly , we obtain one such special eigenstate @xmath70 with the condition @xmath71 , @xmath33 and @xmath63 , consistent with @xcite .",
    "now , we have demonstrated all the exceptional eigenstates of the two - qubit quantum rabi model with finite photon numbers presented in @xcite by finding its algebraic structure in the photon number space .",
    "the special eigenstates @xmath64 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 originate from the permutation symmetry of the qubit - photon coupling terms , and we may conjecture there are similar solutions for similar models . in the weak - coupling regime , the rabi model can reduce to jaynes - cummings model by the rotating - wave approximation , so if there are similar special eigenstates for the two - qubit jaynes - cunmmings model , we may find its application in a simpler way .",
    "now we try to find similar structure for the two - qubit jaynes - cunmmings model @xcite @xmath74 it is easy to find @xmath75 commutes with @xmath76 , so there is a conserved quantity @xmath77 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath73 ( equation ( [ dk1 ] ) ) has a conserved quantity @xmath78 , and it is easy to testify @xmath73 is also an eigenstate of @xmath76 existing in the whole coupling regime with constant eigenenergy for @xmath33 and @xmath79 . to find out all such kinds of eigenstates",

    "the spin singlet is decoupled from the photon field , so the eigenenergy and eigenstate are coupling - independent .",
    "the second case is partly like `` dark state''the eigenenergy is also coupling independent , but the eigenstate is not . for @xmath33 and @xmath79 , equation ( [ en ] )",

    "then we consider the bogoliubov operator @xmath145 .",
    "now @xmath122 is given as @xmath146 applying transformation @xmath136 to the time - independent schdinger equation , we obtain four equations similar to ( [ 1])([4 ] ) @xmath147 expanding the photon field states as @xmath148 , where the normalized extended coherent state @xmath149 is the eigenstate of @xmath150 , and left multiplying @xmath151 , we obtain the recurrence relations for @xmath152 @xmath153 there are three initial conditions , which can be chosen as @xmath154 . to utilize the reflection symmetry @xmath155 , @xmath156 ,",
    "finally , we expand the photon states in terms of the photon number states as @xmath157 , and obtain the recurrence relations for @xmath158 @xmath159 considering @xmath160 , @xmath161 , we obtain @xmath162 , @xmath163 , so there are only two initial conditions , which can be chosen as @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "states @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 in different representations should be only different by a constant ( here can be chosen as @xmath0 ) if they are nondegenerate eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath84 , so we obtain @xmath169 equations @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is chosen arbitrarily , then ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) are mapped to @xmath172    now we are still dealing with power series with infinite terms , so to obtain clear reliable result , we must make all the power series convergent . according to the recurrence relations for @xmath142 ( equations ( [ ac1])([ac4 ] ) ) , @xmath152 ( equations ( [ ad1])([ad4 ] ) ) and @xmath158 ( equations ( [ ae1])([ae4 ] ) ) , we find the radii of convergence of corresponding power series are @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively .",

    "the spectrum is shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "it is seen there are no level crossings within the same parity subspace , so we can label each eigenstates with two quantum numbers  energy level and parity , but the total degrees of freedom are three , so according to the quantum integrability criterion proposed by braak @xcite , the model is non - integrable , consistent with what the narrow avoided crossings in the same parity subspace indicate @xcite and the result in @xcite .    ,  @xmath106 ,  @xmath65 ,  @xmath186 ,  @xmath189 . @xmath190 and @xmath191 are numerical solutions with even and odd parity respectively , while @xmath68 and @xmath69 are analytical solutions with even and odd parity respectively.[figure3],scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "we have clarified the algebraic structure behind the possibility of the quasi - exact solutions with finite photon numbers found in @xcite . by analyzing the hamiltonian structure in the photon number space , we find that the permutation symmetry of the qubit - photon coupling terms for the two qubits brings about closed subspace , and hence quasi - exact solutions for certain parameters .",
    "the novel coupling - dependent eigenstates existing in the whole coupling regime with constant eigenenergy @xmath84 equal to single photon energy @xmath1 correspond to quasi - exact solutions with at most @xmath0 photon , with the condition for the qubits energy splittings @xmath192 or @xmath193 .",
    "we have demonstrated this directly from the hamiltonian structure .",
    "these special eigenstates are partly like `` dark states '' , but are coupling - dependent , which may have some potential application . furthermore , based on our study on the two - qubit quantum rabi model ,",
    "we conjecture such `` dark states''-like eigenstates commonly exist in similar models with permutation symmetry of the qubit - photon coupling terms .",
    "for example , for the homogenous coupled two - qubit jaynes - cummings model , there are many such kinds of eigenstates with constant energy @xmath5 in the whole coupling regime , with the condition @xmath194 .",
    "one of these special states is also the eigenstate of the two - qubit quantum rabi model .",
    "since the jaynes - cummings model is simper than the rabi model , we may find the application of these special eigenstates easier .    besides , using bogoliubov operators , we have analytically retrieved the solution of the two - qubit quantum rabi model .",
