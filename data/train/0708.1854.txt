    "the reflection nebulae ic4954 and ic4955 are located in the vulpecula constellation on the galactic plane around ( @xmath2)=(@xmath3 ) .",
    "these nebulae are associated with the young open cluster roslund 4 @xcite . the heliocentric distance and the age of this cluster",
    "are estimated based on the analysis of isochrones as 10myr and 2.9kpc by @xcite , 4myr and 2kpc by @xcite ( hereafter p03 ) , and 15myr and 2kpc by @xcite ( hereafter d04 ) .",
    "these studies suggest the presence of stars of a relatively wide age range and on - going star - formation in the ic4954/4955 region . in this paper",
    "we assume the distance to be 2kpc .",
    "p03 and d04 also detected three active regions in [ sii ] images and some of them are classified as herbig haro objects . the h@xmath4 , [ nii ] and [ sii ] emission lines from the cluster members are detected in optical spectroscopic observations ( d04 ) .",
    "this region is an interesting place for the study of star - formation process because of the co - existence of both young and relatively old populations ( p03 ; d04 ) . except for the dedicated observation of d04 ,",
    "the parallax , radial velocity , proper motions and spectral type of the cluster members ( or clues for the identification of the members ) are largely unavailable in existing catalogs because of its far heliocentric distance .",
    "@xmath5co observations show that at least one cloud of 10@xmath6 @xmath7 is associated with this region @xcite . in the infrared , these nebulae",
    "are observed in the iras and msx galactic surveys .",
    "the iras point source catalog ( psc ) has entries of three point sources in this region , whereas the msx map shows distinguished structures in four mid - infrared bands of a(8.28@xmath0 m ) , c(11.2@xmath0 m ) , d(14.3@xmath0 m ) and e(21.34@xmath0 m ) .",
    "however , the poor spatial resolution of iras and the insufficient sensitivity of the msx 21@xmath0 m prevent us from making detailed analysis of this interesting region in the infrared .",
    "this region is not included in the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire with _ spitzer _",
    "( glimpse ; @xcite ) .",
    "akari is the first japanese infrared astronomical satellite dedicated for infrared astronomy @xcite .",
    "it has two scientific instruments : the infrared camera ( irc ; @xcite ) that covers near- and mid - infrared wavelengths of 226@xmath0 m , and the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ; @xcite ) that covers the far - infrared spectral range of 50200@xmath0 m .",
    "the performance of both instruments has been confirmed by observations during the performance verification ( pv ) phase from 2006 april 24 to may 8 .",
    "the present paper reports the results of observations of the ic4954/4955 region with both irc and fis taken mainly during the pv phase .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in  2 .",
    "the observational results are shown in  3 .",
    "the nature and the origin of the roslund 4 region are discussed in ",
    "finally , we summarize the results in  5 .",
    "akari seven band images were taken by two scientific instruments with three kinds of operation mode .",
    "the observational parameters are summarized in table [ table : data ] .",
    ".observational parameters for ic4954/4955 by akari [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     comparison of figures  [ fig:3color1]a and c indicates that the density of stars is low in between ic4954 and ic4955 in the optical image , whereas the dust emission is seen in the corresponding region in the wide - l ( 140@xmath0 m ) image .",
    "the size of the region ( @xmath8 ) is sufficiently larger than the fwhm of the beam size of the wide - l band ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) , thus the presence of the far - infrared emission in between the two nebulae is not spurious .",
    "it can be surmised that the region is a dark nebula filled with dust grains .",
    "the region around source f in figure  [ fig : gallery]b also appears dark in the optical image , suggesting that source f is surrounded by a large amount of dust .",
    "the mid - infrared color variation , the location of early - type stars , and the distribution of red objects strongly suggest that ysos are being born in the region on the north - east side of the arcs .",
    "their formation may be triggered by the existing early - type stars and star - formation is propagating from south - west to north - east .",
    "this picture is revealed by the high spatial resolution ( especially in 11@xmath0 m ) and the multi - band ( especially 140 or 160@xmath0 m ) infrared data of akari . because of the arc - like shape rather than the cometary shape , it is conjectured that the regions where ysos are concentrated in ic4954/4955 are not pre - existing clouds imploded and/or evaporated by the effect of stellar winds , such as in the elephant trunk nebula @xcite , but are rather triggered by the ` collect and collapse ' type mechanism with stellar winds of the heating stars @xcite .",
    "rather uniformly distributed ysos may also support this interpretation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to investigate the origin of the ic4954/4955 , mid - infrared maps of the surrounding region of about @xmath1 at 9 and 18@xmath0 m are created from the irc all - sky survey data .",
    "the s9w / l18w color image is shown in figure  [ fig : wide]a with the contours of the 100@xmath0 m data of the iras sky survey atlas ( issa , @xcite ) .",
    "it indicates that there is a cavity of low mid - infrared emission centered around ( @xmath4 , @xmath10 ) = ( 20h 03 m , + 29@xmath11.00 ) and that the ic4954/4955 region is located on an edge of the cavity .",
    "image ( figure  [ fig : gallery ] ) .    to examine and confirm the presence of the cavity ,",
    "hi 21 cm data of the region are obtained from the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) and examined .",
    "figure  [ fig : posdef ] shows a plot of the intensity vs. velocity of the hi data .",
    "it indicates that the hi gas in this region has a velocity range of 030kms@xmath12 .",
    "this is in good agreement of the velocity range of co emission associated this region of 619kms@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the hi intensity integrated over 030kms@xmath12 is shown in figure  [ fig : wide]b , which clearly supports the presence of a low density cavity around the center of the map . in figure",
    "[ fig : wide]b also plotted by the crosses are yso candidates .",
    "they are selected from the 2mass catalog based on the same criteria , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as in figure  [ fig:3color1]b .",
    "in addition a condition of @xmath15 is estimated from the k magnitude of the yso candidates in figure  [ fig:3color1]b and applied to exclude foreground and background sources .",
    "the symbols @xmath4 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 indicate the regions where concentration of ysos is seen .",
    "yso candidates seem to be located on the edge of the cavity .",
    "it is most clearly seen in the eastern edge , which includes the ic4954/4955 region as well as the regions @xmath4 and @xmath16 , however , only a few ysos are found at the north and south edges .",
    "( 160mm,160mm)figure6.eps    ( 110mm,110mm)figure7.eps    the radius of the cavity is estimated as about 10pc .",
    "the cavity is elongated and partly collapsed .",
    "such structures are commonly seen in galactic bubbles @xcite .",
    "the cavity of the ic4954/4955 may have been created by supernovae ( sne ) or o - type stars .",
    "progenitor candidates have been searched for in the tycho-2 spectral type catalog @xcite , all - sky compiled catalog @xcite , mean radial velocities catalog @xcite , and snrs catalog @xcite . but",
    "any progenitors of such a kind are not found .",
    "any snr like structures are not found either in the soft x - ray maps of rosat or in the nvss 1.4ghz map @xcite , although there seem to be some point - like condensations in the region .",
    "the cavity of the size of @xmath1840pc in ic1396 is made by a single o6.5 star @xcite .",
    "thus the o8en star located at the south - west of the ic4954/4955 ( figure  [ fig:3color1]b ) could be the progenitor because the dense region is spread at the north - east of the cavity",
    ". however the star may be too young if the age of roslund 4 is 15myr and the star - formation was delayed relative to the trigger event because of the internal motions @xcite .",
    "since snrs disappear in the time scale of @xmath181myr and the age of the cavity must be older than 4myr based on the age of the roslund 4 , it is not unexpected that there is no direct sign for the progenitor .",
    "the cepheus bubble @xcite is also thought to be formed by o - type stars or supernovae , but shows no direct hint of them .",
    "the present akari observations have revealed another bubble of small scale , which seems to trigger past ( 415myr old ) star - formation in ic4954/4955 .",
    "it also indicates the ` current star - formation ' in the region , which is triggered by stars of the second generation .",
    "this trigger seems to be different from the ` globule - squeezing ' type in the elephant trunk nebula near the cepheus bubble .",
    "the present observations indicate triggered star - formation over the three generations in a different spatial scale in the ic4954/4955 .",
    "with the two scientific instruments ( irc and fis ) on board akari we obtained 7 band images of ic4954/4955 from 7 to 160@xmath0 m with higher spatial resolution and higher sensitivities than previous observations .",
    "based on these observations we obtained the following results .",
    "\\(1 ) the mid - infrared images at 9 , 11 , and 18@xmath0 m reveal several distinct structures in the region .",
    "particularly they show three arc - like structures that seem to have been created by stellar winds from the existing b - type stars .",
    "the difference between the s9w ( 9@xmath0 m ) and s11 ( 11@xmath0 m ) images is not significant , indicating that the variation in the spectrum of 613@xmath0 m is not large and that the contribution of line emission from ionized gas , such as [ neii]12.8@xmath0 m , is relatively small compared to the uir band emissions at 6.2 , 7.7 , and 11.2@xmath0 m .",
    "\\(2 ) the s9w ( 9@xmath0 m ) to l18w ( 18@xmath0 m ) images appear systematically different from each other .",
    "the l18w emission is strong near the exciting stars , whereas the s9w emission is dominant in the surrounding region .",
    "the s9w filter probes the uir band emission more effectively than the iras 12@xmath0 m because its band profile is shifted to shorter wavelengths .",
    "we interpret the systematic mid - infrared color variation in terms of the decreasing contribution of thermal dust emission with the distance from the exciting source .",
    "the color variation clearly indicates the location of exciting stars , suggesting that the star - formation in ic4954/4955 is progressing from south - west to north - east .",
    "\\(3 ) young stellar objects are distinguishable for the first time at 11@xmath0 m .",
    "they are located in the large s9w to l18w ratio regions , suggesting that current star - formation has been triggered by previous star - formation activities .",
    "\\(4 ) the fis data allow to correctly estimate the total infrared luminosity from the region , which is about one sixth of the energy emitted from the existing early - type stars .",
    "thus there is little possibility that embedded luminous stars have escaped detection .",
    "it also suggests that the total dust mass of the infrared emission is about 60@xmath7 .",
    "the 140 and 160@xmath0 m images reveal the presence of a high density region between ic4954 and ic4955 , which is also supported by optical images .",
    "\\(5 ) the irc all - sky survey data together with the hi 21 cm data further suggest the presence of a bubble - like structure of a degree scale , on whose edge the ic4954/4955 region is located , indicating triggered star formation over three generations .",
    "the ic4954/4955 region is not a massive star - formation region , and is currently populated by b - type stars .",
    "the mass of the infrared emitting material is also not huge .",
    "the suggested hole of the interstellar matter is not large and thus should be created by a less energetic event compared to ic1396 .",
    "the present observations suggest that even in such a moderate star - forming region , the sequential star - formation occurs and is on - going at present . medium - scale star - formation could be common and should be studied in future investigations .",
    "akari continues to provide significant data for the study of interstellar medium and star forming regions owing to its high sensitivity , wide wavelength coverage and wide mapping capability , during the course of its mission .",
