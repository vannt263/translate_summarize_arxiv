    "the particle motion on a given curved surface is old but interesting problem in wide range of physics .",
    "especially the diffusion process of particles on such a manifold is still an open problem , and related to various kinds of phenomena .",
    "for example the motion of protein on cell membrane has great importance in biophysics .",
    "there are several research papers discussing on this problem .",
    "some of them are treating this problem by using usual diffusion equation with curved coordinate , and discuss the curvature ( gauss curvature ) dependence of its solution @xcite .",
    "other of them use the langevin equation on curved surface and calculating the curvature dependence of diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanics of particle motion on such a curved manifold is also considered by many authors .",
    "this problem is usually explained by the schroedinger equation with laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "however , when we treat the curved surface as embedded one in 3 dimensional euclidean space , situation is changed and then we have a quantum potential term related to the curvature additional to the kinetic operator @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "another example is in larger scale physics in which our consideration is devoted .",
    "patterns of animal skins are well expressed by the reaction diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "but the patterns are different for each parts even in one individual . for example , char fish , the side part has white spot pattern , but the back part has labyrinth pattern .",
    "( for these two patterns , see for example @xcite . )",
    "one of the reasons might come from the curvature difference between side part and back part .",
    "if the diffusion is influenced by the curvature , this difference of patterns might be explained .",
    "furthermore , the cross section of fish has form of ellipsoid and the surface can be approximated as the one of elliptic cylinder . in two dimensional space , we have only two kinds of curvature , one is gauss curvature and other is mean curvature .",
    "both are constructed from second fundamental tensor by taking determinant or trace .",
    "gauss curvature can also be constructed only by metric tensor and its derivatives , but this is not the case for the mean curvature .",
    "the elliptic cylinder , in which we have much interest , has zero gauss curvature and non - zero mean curvature . therefore to explain the pattern change of char fish , solution of the diffusion equation should depend on mean curvature",
    "this is impossible if we start from usual diffusion equation because it depends only on metric but not on second fundamental tensor .",
    "therefore we need some new diffusion equation , which bring not only gauss curvature but also mean curvature . in this article",
    ", we discuss how to construct such curvature dependent diffusion equation .",
    "the simple extension of diffusion equation in euclidean space to riemannian space can be done by changing laplacian with cartesian coordinate to the one with curved coordinate , i.e. laplace beltrami operator .",
    "this coordinate change is not enough for our purpose , however .",
    "the way of construction of new diffusion equation in this paper is the followings .",
    "we re - identify the two dimensional diffusion as the limiting process from three dimensional diffusion .",
    "we place the curved surface @xmath2 in three dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 , and we put two similar copies of @xmath2 , called @xmath3 and @xmath4 at a small distance of @xmath5 .",
    "our particles can only move between these two surfaces , and later we take a limit @xmath6 .",
    "we look for the form of diffusion equation in this limit .",
    "the coordinates we use hereafter is the followings .",
    "( see fig.1 )    @xmath7 is the cartesian coordinate in @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath8 is the cartesian coordinate which specifies only the points on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath9 is the curved coordinate on @xmath2 .",
    "( small latin indices @xmath10 runs from 1 to 2 .",
    ") @xmath11 is the coordinate in @xmath0 normal to @xmath2 .",
    "further by using the normal unit vector @xmath12 on @xmath2 at point @xmath13 , we can identify any points between two surfaces @xmath4 and @xmath3 by the following thin - layer approximation @xcite .",
    "@xmath14    where @xmath15 .        from this relation",
    "we can obtain the curvilinear coordinate system between two surfaces ( @xmath16 ) by the coordinate @xmath17 , and metric @xmath18 .",
    "( hereafter greek indices @xmath19 runs from 0 to 2 . )",
    "@xmath20    each part of @xmath18 is the following .    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the metric on @xmath2 .",
    "hereafter indices @xmath23 are lowered or rised by @xmath24 and its inverse @xmath25 .",
    "we also obtain    @xmath26    we can proceed the calculation by using the new variables .",
    "we first define the tangential vector to @xmath2 by    @xmath27    note that @xmath28 .",
    "then we obtain two relations .",
    "gauss equation : @xmath29    weingarten equation : @xmath30    where @xmath31 @xmath32 is called euler - schauten tensor , or second fundamental tensor defined as    @xmath33    the second fundamental tensor @xmath32 is the projection of @xmath34 into the surface .",
    "furthermore , the mean curvature is given by @xmath35    and ricci scalar curvature @xmath36 is obtained by    @xmath37    then we have the formula for metric of curvilinear coordinate in a neighborhood of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath38    under the inversion @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 from @xmath42 .",
    "therefore @xmath43 is invariant under @xmath39 .",
    "+ now we have the total metric tensor such as , @xmath44",
    "let us denote 3 dimensional diffusion field as @xmath45 , and laplacian as @xmath46 .",
    "then we have the equation with normalization condition @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the diffusion constant , and @xmath49 .",
    "our aim is to construct the effective two dimensional diffusion equation from 3d equation above .    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the two dimensional diffusion field , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is unknown effective 2d diffusion operator which might not be equal to simple 2d laplace beltrami operator .    from two normalization conditions ,",

    "next we analyze new operator @xmath60 . from the form of laplace beltrami operator @xmath61 we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64    then our diffusion equation has form    @xmath65    the contribution from @xmath66 vanishes because @xmath67 \\mid _ { -\\epsilon/2}^{\\epsilon/2 } = 0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equality is the requirement that diffusion flow does not pass through the surface : @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "+ now we calculate r.h.s of ( [ eq : new ] ) up to @xmath68 .",
    "since we have @xmath69 from ( [ eq : relation ] ) , we need to expand @xmath70 up to @xmath68 .",
    "the following relations are useful    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is used .    then the operator @xmath70 can be expanded as follows    @xmath73    where ,    @xmath74    @xmath75    then our two dimensional effective diffusion equation up to @xmath76 is , @xmath77    to proceed the @xmath11 integration , we suppose there is no diffusion flow in normal direction in layer , that is , @xmath78 solution is , @xmath79    each integration can be explicitly performed , and we obtain @xmath80 where we have used the definition @xmath81    we obtain the final form of equation up to @xmath82 as    @xmath83    where @xmath84 .",
    "+ we give two comments here .",
    "first , @xmath76 term disappears .",
    "since @xmath1 has the dimension of length , it always appears with curvature @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the 1st order term , if it exists , it contains 1st order of curvature @xmath85 . but this curvature depends on unphysical choice of normal unit vector @xmath86 , and so it does not appear .",
    "second , additional potential term disappears . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the similar embedding techniques leads to the appearance of additional potential term written by curvature .",
    "but in our classical case we have no such terms .",
    "because in diffusion equation , potential term breaks probability conservation law , i.e. @xmath87 @xmath88    the normal diffusion flow can be written in general coordinate , @xmath89 the anomalous diffusion flow is , @xmath90    the diffusion equation is written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the covariant derivative . by using a suitable boundary condition , we can prove @xmath93",
    "the anomalous flow equals to zero for the flat surface .",
    "the last term in equation ( [ eq : anom ] ) shows that curvature gradient generate the flow without particle density gradient . from the signature of this term",
    ", this flow goes from the smaller ricci scalar point to the larger ricci scalar point .",
    "ricci scalar can take the negative , zero , and positive values .",
    "( ricci scalar @xmath36 is related to gauss curvature by @xmath94 $ ] . )",
    "let us work with the coordinate which satisfies @xmath95,\\ ] ] at point @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the curvature radius along the @xmath9 coordinate and it takes positive or negative value for convex or concave .",
    "( the metric can be diagonalized by choosing the two coordinates as to satisfy orthogonality , and it can be normalized by using the re - parametrization .",
    "the second fundamental tensor is diagonalized by rotation of coordinate . )",
    "then at point @xmath96 , we have @xmath98 and ,    * @xmath99  if the surface is convex or concave . * @xmath100  if the surface is essentially flat . *",
    "@xmath101  if the surface is hyperbolic .",
    "therefore the flow goes from hyperbolic or flat points to convex or concave points with positive larger ricci scalar value .",
    "+ next we consider the first term in ( [ eq : anom ] ) .",
    "we have positive or negative value for @xmath102 depending on the value of curvature . in our coordinate",
    ", we can immediately write it in the simple form    @xmath103    when the surface is hyperbolic ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 usual diffusion occurs ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .",
    "when the surface is convex or concave ( @xmath106 ) , @xmath107 @xmath108    in this case , we have three possibilities .",
    "one possibility is that both are negative , if @xmath109 then we have no diffusion but concentration occurs ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .",
    "the second possibility is that one of two is positive and the other is negative , if @xmath110 then we have diffusion in one direction , but concentration in another direction ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    the third possibility for @xmath106 is ,    @xmath111 this is critical point , where the flow stops for larger curvature direction and flow concentrates for smaller curvature direction",
    ". +        when the ricci scalar is zero ( @xmath112 ) , for example @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 follows .",
    "the diffusion occurs only in @xmath116 direction but not in another direction .",
    "( see fig .",
    "5 ) .        in this way",
    ", this anomalous diffusion flow has much varieties depending on the curvature .",
    "let us consider one simple example where diffusion coefficient depends on curvature .",
    "the surface of elliptic cylinder is the case of @xmath117 just as figure 5 , but the surface has non zero mean curvature .",
    "ellipsoid is given by the equation @xmath118        then any points on cylinder are specified by curved coordinate @xmath119 and @xmath120 ; @xmath121    another choice of coordinate instead of @xmath119 is , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is defined as @xmath124    the length of @xmath125 is given by @xmath126 with @xmath127 @xmath128 is the elliptic integral of the second kind .",

    "@xmath134 then we collect all the necessary quantities as follows @xmath135    then we obtain the total diffusion equation expressed by the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath136 where the effective diffusion coefficient depends on mean curvature .",
    "@xmath137 where @xmath138 .    under this equation , we obtain the following particle number conservation law . @xmath139 with suitable neumann boundary condition .    by using the variable @xmath140 instead of",

    ", curvature dependent potential @xmath143 can be written as function of @xmath140 .",
    "the simulation can be done as usual diffusion equation . for @xmath144 and @xmath145 using periodic boundary condition ,",
    "since the length of @xmath146 is larger than one of @xmath140 , the diffusion in @xmath125 direction occurs fastly and then the diffusion in @xmath146 direction follows slowly just like @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath125-directional diffusion can not occur uniformly , because at @xmath148 and @xmath149 the diffusive coefficient is higher than other points .",

    "we have discussed on the diffusion equation on curved surface embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "we obtained the new diffusion equation up to @xmath68 which includes anomalous diffusive flow additional to the usual one .",
    "this anomalous flow depends on the second fundamental tensor , and it has not only diffusion but also concentration properties depending on the curvature of its manifold .    at the point with negative ricci scalar @xmath104 , surface is hyperbolic , and diffusion in both direction occurs .",
    "( fig.2 )    when ricci scalar is positive @xmath106 , we have three possibilities .",
    "@xmath97 appearing below is curvature radius in each direction ( @xmath151 ) .    * concentration in both direction ( fig.3 ) , when @xmath109 * concentration in smaller curvature direction , and diffusion in higher curvature direction ( fig.4 ) , when @xmath110 * concentration in smaller curvature direction , and no flow in higher curvature direction , when @xmath152    when ricci scalar is zero @xmath117 , surface is essentially flat , but we have finite curvature radius in one direction",
