    "in recent years , observational advances have made it possible to measure column density profiles in prestellar cores .",
    "various methods are being used in the literature .",
    "@xcite measured mm continuum emission , while @xcite utilized mid - ir absorption , and @xcite measured dust extinction and reddening of the light of background stars in the near - ir .",
    "a fourth method is to use flux measurements in optically thin lines @xcite .",
    "most of the column density profiles measured in these ways show certain prominent common features : a central flat region , followed by a power - law decline .",
    "some cores additionally exhibit signatures of steepening of the profile , while some show a more - or - less smooth merger to some background value of the column density @xcite .",
    "one model often used to fit to such cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the _ bonnor - ebert sphere _ ( hereafter be sphere ) .",
    "this model assumes an isothermal sphere in equilibrium , acted upon only by gravity and thermal pressure , and bound by some external pressure @xcite . in the central region its density profile is flat with density @xmath1 .",
    "the size of this region is proportional to the jeans length , @xmath2 .",
    "it transitions into a power - law decline that approaches the _ singular isothermal sphere _ ( sis ) with @xmath3 for large radii @xcite .",
    "the cloud is finally cut off at some finite radius , where external pressure forces match the internal forces .",
    "the be model invokes the dimensionless radius parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the value @xmath5 marks a dividing line such that clouds truncated at dimensionless radius @xmath6 are in an unstable equilibrium , and clouds with @xmath7 are stable .",
    "the column density profile of the be sphere , obtained by integrating the volume density numerically along a line of sight , matches well with some observations ( b68 ; * ? ? ?",
    "depending on the parameters , the power - law decline @xmath8 in column density can be more or less pronounced , or even almost completely absent .",
    "the profile steepens at the edge because the line of sight through the sphere becomes shorter .",
    "this is a geometric effect which is present in all truncated models , unless the density _ increases _ sufficiently fast with radius .    while physically motivated and reproducing features of several observed column density profiles , the be model has shortcomings .",
    "the most important is the key assumption of equilibrium .",
    "in fact , most fits are found to be supercritical @xcite , representing unstable equilibria .",
    "these states are not expected to exist in reality , as any perturbation will send them to immediate collapse . on a more practical side ,",
    "the procedure of fitting the be model to observations is quite involved .",
    "the volume density is only available as a numerical solution , which then needs to be integrated ( again numerically ) to calculate the column density .",
    "sometimes the fit demands temperatures _ well above _ those measured for the centres of prestellar cores @xcite , and predicted by detailed models of the thermodynamics within the core @xcite . finally , most of the observed cores are deeply embedded within their parent clouds , and the source of a bounding external pressure is not obvious .",
    "the often - cited example b68 @xcite is an exception , as it is thought to lie within a hot hii region .",
    "we stress that the generic features of the be density profile are not unique to equilibrium situations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the flat region with adjacent @xmath9 density profile appears also in solutions of the hydrodynamic equations for gravitationally collapsing objects @xcite , as long as pressure is not completely negligible @xcite .",
    "the pressure gradient then establishes a region where it nearly balances gravity . here",
    ", the density is nearly constant on the scale of the local jeans length , shrinking in size over time as the density increases . inverted",
    ", this requires that @xmath10 in the outer profile that is left behind outside the central region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "there is no reason why the above two features ( flat region with size of jeans length and adjacent @xmath9 density profile ) should be present in a non - self - gravitating cloud .",
    "however , @xcite find that convergent turbulent flows , with and even without self - gravity ( which are expected to have very different volume density profiles ) , nevertheless yield column density profiles that resemble those of a be sphere .",
    "there are three reasons for this seemingly surprising result .",
    "the first one is the effect of smoothing the data , by angle - averaging , and also by integration along the line of sight .",
    "secondly , the be sphere leaves the modeller the freedom to fit the size of the central flat region by varying the temperature . indeed ,",
    "@xcite fit their simulated cores with be temperatures in the range of @xmath11 , despite their models being strictly isothermal at @xmath12 .",
    "finally , the position of the outer radius cutoff is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "this often leaves large parts of profiles unfitted . in this paper",
    ", we argue that fitting a prestellar core profile at a _ set _ temperature _ does _ still allow one to distinguish between different models of internal structure .",
    "we propose an analytic density profile reproducing the characteristics of not only isothermal equilibria @xcite , but also non - equilibrium collapse solutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and many observed profiles @xcite . within the margins of uncertainty",
    "it fits the observations as well as the be model does .",
    "however , it possesses a closed - form expression for the column density , and is therefore very easy to fit .",
    "furthermore , the temperature can be an input parameter instead of a fitting parameter , so that the model avoids some of the possible inconsistencies of fitting the be model to either observations or simulation results .",
    "we can use our model to make some inference about the dynamical state of the core .",
    "this paper is organized the following way : section [ sec : sphericalgeometry ] describes the spherical model and its parameters , while section [ sec : diskgeometry ] presents a corresponding model for intrinsically flattened objects . in section [ sec : applications ] , we apply our model to b68 and l1689b , and we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the characteristics found in observed column density profiles and theoretically both in equilibrium and collapse solutions can be parametrized by a volume density more generic than the be sphere .",
    "we propose using the profile@xmath13characterized by a central volume density @xmath14 and truncated at some radius @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 fits the size of the flat region in terms of the jeans length , and is given by @xmath17where @xmath18 is the gravitational constant and @xmath19 is a constant of proportionality .",
    "this profile is also mentioned in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the temperature @xmath20 , which can be constrained observationally , is _ not _ used as a fitting parameter .",
    "it enters through the value of the isothermal sound speed @xmath21 . the boltzmann constant",
    "is denoted by @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the mean mass of a particle , where @xmath24 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .",
    "we assume a @xmath25 number fraction of helium .",

    "the quantity @xmath36 determines the size of the region described by the power - law .",

    "the dashed - line shows a model dominated by the power - law regime , with @xmath39 .",

    "the three parameters to fit are ( i ) the outer radius @xmath15 , ( ii ) the central column density @xmath42 , and ( iii ) the size of the flat region @xmath16 .",
    "the latter contains the product of @xmath19 and @xmath43 , as shown in equation ( [ eq : definitiona ] ) .",
    "if the temperature is pre - determined , @xmath16 only depends on the value of @xmath19 .",
    "this then allows for a stability assessment , as demonstrated in the following section .",
    "the pressure in an isothermal system is given by @xmath44 , and hence the pressure gradient for the spherically symmetric volume density profile of equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) is@xmath45 ^{2}}.\\]]in the inner regions , where @xmath46,@xmath47this demonstrates a simple point : the larger the flat region @xmath16 , the smaller the pressure gradient in that region .",
    "the minimal value for @xmath16 is reached in an equilibrium situation . a larger @xmath16 would result in a smaller pressure gradient , gravity would win out , and collapse would ensue .",
    "conversely , for @xmath16 smaller than its equilibrium value the pressure force would dominate , causing expansion . however , that case is not probable since a profile with @xmath48 mandates a strong gravitational influence .",
    "another well - known model besides the sis is the so - called larson - penston solution ( lp solution ) , a self - similar spherical collapse solution , assuming a homogeneous initial density distribution @xcite .",

    "the be profile does not join onto the sis profile right away .",
    "it overshoots , then steepens and asymptotically approaches the sis profile at large radii .",
    "we may ask which value of @xmath19 is most appropriate to model a critical be sphere .",
    "the overshoot effectively produces a larger flat region if the solution is truncated at @xmath59 .",
    "the resultant @xmath16 has to be larger than for the sis .",

    "[ fig : bevsgeneric ] . profile ( a ) shows a subcritical be sphere , i.e. a stable equilibrium solution . in this case",
    ", there is no discernible power - law region and the central flat region makes up a significant portion of the total radius . the cut - off becomes dominant just outside the flat region , and the best - fit dimensionless dynamics parameter is @xmath60 .",
    "note that the density contrast is less than an _ e_-folding , which means a mean column density enhancement of @xmath61 over the background .",
    "such an object would not be observationally characterized as a prestellar core @xcite .",
    "profile ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bevsgeneric ] shows the opposite situation , where the power - law portion of the profile is fit , and @xmath62 is closer to the equilibrium value . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bevssisvslpvsgeneric ] , the be model initially has a power - law index steeper than @xmath63 .",
    "this is the reason why the profiles do not match up as well as for the other cases .",
    "profile ( b ) finally shows a critical be sphere .",
    "a density contrast greater than @xmath64 would characterize an unstable equilibrium , initiating collapse upon the smallest of perturbations .",
    "the two profiles are very similar , only minor deviations are discernible . in order to fit our model to the overshoot of the be profile over the sis , @xmath16 has to be larger , which can only be achieved by @xmath65 .",
    "we demonstrate this effect on the examples of b68 and l1689b in sections [ subsec : b68 ] and [ subsec : l1689b ] : as a consistency check , we insert the derived be temperatures into our model , and indeed find @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "note that the be model _ is _ a valid model in absence of any effects other than gravity and thermal pressure , and thus we conclude that in this case , not the asymptotic value of @xmath68 but rather the critical be value of @xmath65 is relevant for the stability assessment .",
    "we stress that if @xmath19 is significantly larger than that , it is strongly indicative of collapse .",
    "( see text for explanation ) .",
    "( c ) presents a fit to a highly supercritical ( unstable ) be model . ]    since the be model effectively has @xmath69 and collapsing clouds have @xmath70 , trying to force a be model fit to such a cloud results in spurious higher temperatures .",
    "this can be seen in @xcite .",
    "a factor of @xmath71 in the dimensionless dynamics parameter @xmath19 needs to be compensated by a factor of @xmath72 in temperature when fitting a be equilibrium state .",
    "both our model and the be sphere have a well - defined outer radius , and the total mass depends on it . for the profile of equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) , the total mass has a closed - form expression . evaluating @xmath73 yields@xmath74 .",
    "\\label{eq : mass}\\]]there is evidence for some power - law behaviour in most observed profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such a situation , the value of @xmath75 must be at least @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : sigmageneric ] ) .",
    "then , the contribution of @xmath77 is quite close to its limiting value of @xmath78 , and the total mass is given by@xmath79with @xmath80 error .",
    "the equivalent expression for the be model is ( derived assuming an sis profile at large radii ) @xmath81    both expressions for the masses are linearly dependent on the unknown radius @xmath15 . for a given ( measured ) temperature , our model additionally invokes the dimensionless dynamics parameter @xmath19 , which is well constrained by the size of the flat region .",
    "the be mass instead depends on the temperature of the fit , which we show in sections [ subsec : params_spher ] and [ subsec : l1689b ] to potentially be a very poor value , and prone to overestimation by as much as a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "most observed cores do not appear circular in projection . a corresponding analysis as in section [ subsec : params_spher ] can be done for a disc - like geometry as well . here , a generic face - on column density profile is@xmath82this profile provides a good fit to the column density of collapsing flattened clouds @xcite , even though the models in that paper are not truncated .    assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and ignoring the effect of external pressure , the volume density is proportional to the square of the column density@xmath83and the density accordingly is given by@xmath84the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "is well justified by simulations when some source of flattening is present , such as rotation @xcite , or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "abbreviating @xmath85 , the volume density profile has exactly the same form as for the spherical case ( with a different constant ) .      integrating @xmath86 through",
    "the disc viewed edge - on , the column density versus the offset @xmath31 has the same functional form as derived above for the spherical case in equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that the central column density is now given by @xmath87 , since for a thin disc , the relation between @xmath16 and the jeans length is @xmath88    this similarity means that both a flattened and a spherical object ( see section [ sec : sphericalgeometry ] ) can be fit with the same formula . note that @xmath89 is the face - on column density , whereas @xmath90 is its edge - on counterpart .",
    "we can compare the ( face - on ) generic column density profile to one of an equilibrium solution , in order to get the minimal value for @xmath16 , as done for the spherical case above . here ,",
    "the appropriate profile is the singular isothermal disc , characterized by@xmath91following the same steps as in section [ subsec : params_spher ] , the large - radius asymptote of equation ( [ eq : disk_sigma ] ) is @xmath92yielding @xmath93 . comparing this expression to equation ( [ eq : jeans_length_disk ] ) , we find @xmath94 for equilibrium .",
    "@xcite show that for an isothermal disc - like cloud during runaway collapse , the self - similar column density profile is given by @xmath95 , analogous to how the lp solution is over - dense compared to the sis .",
    "this provides a good estimate for the value of the dimensionless dynamics parameter for a dynamically collapsing disc - like cloud , @xmath96 .",
    "flattened cloud cores best fit with values for the dimensionless dynamics parameter @xmath97 are therefore close to equilibrium , while @xmath98 is strongly indicative of dynamical collapse .",
    "inclusion of magnetic fields into a spherical model poses a problem : the magnetic field lines can not be arranged in a spherically symmetric way .",
    "there has to be a preferred direction .",
    "however , in disc - like geometry , the axis perpendicular to the disc is preferred already , and can be chosen as the axis of orientation of a large - scale magnetic field . starting with initially straight field lines through a collapsing astrophysical gas sphere , flattening ensues along this preferred direction .",
    "matter can contract significantly along the field lines , but the lorentz force will impede motions perpendicular to the field @xcite .    in the limit of a magnetic field much stronger than the field of the ambient cloud , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite showed that the contribution of the magnetic field can be folded into a force calculation of the collapse of a magnetized disc by magnetic pressure modifying the effective sound speed , and magnetic tension changing the effective gravitational constant .",
    "then we can write ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath99we use the standard definition of the mass - to - flux ratio in units of the critical value : @xmath100collapse requires @xmath101 , otherwise the magnetic forces will dominate over gravity and stabilize the cloud , and evolution can only happen on long time scales by ambipolar diffusion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we can absorb the modification into an effective @xmath19 , writing it as @xmath102 .",
    "the value @xmath103 as derived for the non - magnetic case remains the minimal value , while @xmath104 can exceed it by a factor of @xmath105 to @xmath71 for @xmath106 , which is a reasonable estimate for supercritical cores @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath107 , which leaves it still a factor of @xmath71 smaller than the value for the dimensionless dynamics parameter for dynamical collapse ( @xmath98 , as shown above ) , and thus clearly distinguishable .",
    "similar to the problem for magnetic fields , rotation can not be considered in strict spherical symmetry .",
    "in fact , rotation can be the cause of disc - like geometry , as a collapsing rotating spherical cloud will flatten along the rotation axis before contracting in the radial direction .",
    "there exist self - similar solutions for the collapse of a rotating thin disc @xcite . following the discussion in @xcite",
    ", one can express the additional effect of rotation as an effective acceleration @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the thermal acceleration , while @xmath110 denotes the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "assuming the column density profile of equation ( [ eq : disk_sigma ] ) and proportionality between the specific angular momentum and enclosed mass , this leads to @xmath111this number is computed for a background rotation rate of the molecular cloud @xmath112 , a central column number density @xmath113 , and a temperature @xmath114 .",
    "hence , we find that the effective radial acceleration opposing gravity exceeds the thermal acceleration by less than @xmath115 .",
    "this shows that , unlike magnetic forces , rotation does not significantly modify the size of the flat region and hence the dimensionless dynamics parameter @xmath19 .",
    "we fit both the be model and our model to observational data by determining the best - fitting parameters using a standard levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization algorithm based on minpack .",
    "we fit our model to b68 , the prime example in the literature for an extraordinarily good fit of the be model to a ( angular - averaged ) column density profile measured in near - ir dust extinction @xcite .",
    "b68 is an isolated bok globule , a small dark cloud which has been studied extensively .",
    "@xcite assume a distance of @xmath116 and quote a be mass of @xmath117 , a temperature of @xmath118 , an outer radius of @xmath119 , and a dimensionless outer radius @xmath120 . @xcite and @xcite more recently updated some of these values by measuring the temperature to be @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively , and estimated the cloud to be closer by about @xmath123 , placing it at the near side of the ophiuchus complex .",
    "this reduces the outer radius and decreases the be mass to @xmath124 , but does not change the value for @xmath125 , as that is determined by the shape of the profile .",
    "we perform a similar analysis as @xcite .",
    "we calculate a be sphere , vary the temperature , the dimensionless and physical outer radii @xmath125 and @xmath15 , and fit the line - of - sight integral to the observational data , assuming a distance of @xmath126 .",
    "this procedure yields a be mass of @xmath127 , a be model temperature of @xmath128 , and a central number density of @xmath129 . the outer radius of the best",
    "be fit is @xmath130 , and the dimensionless outer radius @xmath131 .",
    "the best fit of our model to the same data yields a total mass of @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "the size of the flat region is @xmath135 .",
    "assuming a temperature of @xmath136 , as in the observations mentioned above , this corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "we showed in section [ subsec : params_spher ] that a critical be sphere is fit with @xmath65 , and we conclude that the internal structure of b68 may indeed very closely resemble a critical be sphere .",
    "[ fig : fitb68 ] shows that the best fits to b68 of the be sphere and our model differ by very little over the whole range of data .",
    "the be analysis is much more involved and computationally expensive than our model .",
    "it necessitates a numerical solution of the lane - emden equation .",
    "this ordinary differential equation ( ode ) underlies the be model , and does not have a general analytical solution .",
    "the numerical solution is truncated at the dimensionless radius @xmath125 and converted into physical units . only then can one integrate along lines of sight through the solution numerically , yielding the column density to be compared with observational data .",
    "in contrast , fitting our model to a dataset requires less than a dozen lines of code .",
    "another prestellar core to which we apply our model is l1689b .",
    "its central column density is much greater and it is more extended than b68 .",
    "furthermore , it is not isolated , but rather embedded within the larger complex of the ophiuchus molecular cloud .",
    "its profile was measured by @xcite using mid - ir absorption observations and updated by @xcite .",
    "we use the east - west profile , which shows evidence of steepening in the outer regions .",
    "the be fit to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitl1689b ] yields @xmath137 ( supercritical , unstable core ) and a mass of @xmath138 , similar to what @xcite found . fitting our model results in @xmath139",
    ". however , in contrast to the case of b68 , the temperatures of the two fits are vastly different .",
    "the be model requires a temperature @xmath140 , whereas our model can achieve the same quality of fit with a temperature @xmath114 .",
    "we fit the size of the flat region @xmath141 which is a combination of the temperature and @xmath19 .",
