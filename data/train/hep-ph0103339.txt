    ".2 cm let us proceed along the lines of ref . @xcite .",
    "we treat the leptonic part relativistically , but for the description of mesons as bound states of spinless quarks use the nonrelativistic potential model with a confining potential .",
    "we consider the decay in the @xmath17-rest frame .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath40 system at rest has the form    @xmath41 , @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath46 system produced in the semileptonic @xmath47 decay reads    @xmath48 .",
    "the eigenstates of this hamiltonian are @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 potential can be expanded as follows :    @xmath54    .4 cm",
    ".2 cm the relationship between the sum over the individual channels and the meson matrix elements of the operators is established by the sum rules .",
    "let us introduce @xmath55 through the relation ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 the @xmath55 is the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath49 the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "the sum rules are obtained by inserting the full system of the eigenstates @xmath49 into @xmath60 : @xmath61 is the @xmath62 transition form factor .",
    "this relation represents the sum over all @xmath63 resonances in terms of the @xmath17-meson matrix element of the operators @xmath64 . for the potential regular at the origin",
    "@xmath4 the sum over @xmath65 is convergent for any @xmath66 , whereas for the singular potential both sides of eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) are convergent for small @xmath66 and diverge for large @xmath66 . at the moment",
    "we proceed formally and discuss this problem in more detail in section e.    .4 cm",
    ".2 cm making use of the sum rules ( [ sr ] ) , we represent the amplitude as a sum of the operators : @xmath67 this expression is the duality relation for the amplitude : the sum ( [ t1 ] ) runs over the infinite number of the charm resonances , and the sum ( [ t2 ] ) runs over the infinite number of the operators of the increasing dimensions ( the ope series ) .",
    "in fact , the location of singularities in the complex @xmath1-plane in the series ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t3 ] ) is quite different : in ( [ t1 ] ) it is an infinite set of single poles at the different locations corresponding to different charm resonances , and in ( [ t2 ] ) it is an infinite set of poles of the increasing order at the same point .",
    "however this set of equations is only a formal one ; in fact , ( [ t1 ] ) is a summable series leading to a finite result in all cases ; on the other hand , the situation of eq ( [ t3 ] ) is more subtle . in the singular case ,",
    "the coefficients are infinite beyond some order , and one must accordingly truncate the series . in the regular case ,",
    "the eq ( [ t3 ] ) is only an asymptotic series : notice that the geometric sum over @xmath66 in eq ( [ t2 ] ) has a domain of convergence which is repelled to infinity with @xmath65 .",
    "let us illustrate it with a simple example : assume that @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "then the analog of the above equations takes the form @xmath70 the last step is obtained by changing the order of summation and using the relation @xmath71 the series ( [ t4 ] ) in @xmath66 is only asymptotic and not even borel summable .    from the amplitude @xmath15 under the form",
    "( [ t1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ t3 ] ) , respectively , by integration over the same contour c , we can obtain either the width as a sum over the exclusive final states , or as the ope series .",
    "the expression ( [ t3 ] ) is an accurate approximation to ( [ t1 ] ) only when @xmath1 is far from the singularities of @xmath72 .",
    "the contour c can be deformed away from the singularities except near its fixed end points .",
    "when integrating over @xmath1 this is a possible source of discrepancy , i.e. of duality violation .",
    "consequently , we are now going to estimate the integral of expression ( [ t1 ] ) , i.e. the sum over the exclusive channels , and the integral of expression ( [ t3 ] ) , i.e. the ope prediction , and compare both results .",
    ".2 cm    let us first proceed with the amplitude in the form ( [ t3 ] ) and obtain the ope expression for the decay rate .",
    "we consider the leptonic tensor of the general form @xmath73 . for technical reasons ,",
    "it is convenient to isolate @xmath74 in the expression for @xmath58 as follows @xmath75 substituting ( [ deltah1 ] ) in ( [ t3 ] ) and performing the necessary integrations gives a series in @xmath6 @xcite @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . an important feature of the ope series ( [ gamma - ope ] ) is that the leading - order term reproduces the free - quark decay rate , and the first correction emerges only in the @xmath8 order ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    ".2 cm now let us sum the rates of the exclusive channels .",
    "the @xmath62 transition form factors have the form @xcite @xmath79 since @xmath80 in the decay region , these expressions allow calculating the decay rate to the accuracy @xmath81 . explicitly , we obtain @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the main contribution is given by the @xmath84 transition .",
    "excited states contribute only starting from the @xmath85 order in the sv limit .",
    "notice that _ each of the exclusive rates contains terms of the order @xmath81 and @xmath86 which are absent in the ope series_.    summing over all opened exclusive channels gives @xmath87 the sum over the charm resonances is truncated at @xmath88 , which is the total number of the resonance levels opened at @xmath89 . for the confining potential and in the sv limit @xmath88",
    "is found from the relation @xmath90 .",
    "the transition radii in the expression ( [ excl ] ) are not independent and related to each other through the sum rules",
    ". these sum rules can be obtained from ( [ sr ] ) . expanding both sides of ( [ sr ] ) in powers of @xmath2 and taking the linear @xmath16 term",
    "gives the set of the sum rules @xcite : for @xmath91 one finds the bjorken sum rule @xcite , for @xmath92 - the voloshin sum rule @xcite , for @xmath93 - higher moment sum rules : @xmath94    using these relations to rewrite the ope result ( [ gamma - ope ] ) as the sum over hadronic resonances , the difference between the ope and the exclusive sum ( the duality - violating contribution ) explicitly reads @xmath95 quite remarkably , @xmath96 happens to be equal to the sum of the extrapolated widths for charm states beyond the kinematical limit .",
    "a similar expression is found in @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the duality - violating effect is connected with the charm states forbidden kinematically in the decay process .",
    "notice that @xmath98 , because @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is odd .    to estimate the size of the duality - violation effects , the behavior of the _ transition radii _ and the relation between @xmath102 and @xmath88 , which will be given by the behaviour of the _ excitation energies _ also at large @xmath65 , are needed .",
    "for quite a general form of the confining potential we can write the following relations for @xmath102 at large @xmath65 @xmath103 for @xmath100 and @xmath104 , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 some positive numbers .",
    "in particular , this estimate is valid for the confining potentials with a power behavior at large @xmath107 .",
    "this estimate for @xmath102 is only depending on the behaviour of the potential at large distances .    the behavior of the radii @xmath108 at large @xmath65",
    "are then connected with the finiteness of the r.h.s . of the sum rules ( [ sr2 ] ) : for a potential regular at @xmath4 , the matrix elements in the r.h.s . of the sum rules",
    "are finite for any @xmath66 , which means that the radii @xmath108 are decreasing with @xmath65 faster than any power .",
    "essentially this means that @xmath109 , and therefore the duality - violating effect in the decay rate in ( [ dv ] ) is of order @xmath110 .",
    "one of such examples , the harmonic oscillator potential , is discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , if the potential is singular at @xmath4 , the situation changes dramatically .",
    "first , only a few first number of the matrix elements @xmath111 are finite . as seems to be the case in the pure coulomb case@xcite . for similar phenomena in a perturbation expansion ,",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "we can try to proceed along the same lines but then have to truncate the series in @xmath7 at the last finite term .",
    "we want to estimate the difference between this truncated series and the exclusive sum .",
    "let us illustrate this considering a potential with a coulomb behavior at small @xmath107 , @xmath112 , and confining at large @xmath107",
    ". then @xmath113 are finite for @xmath114 , but diverge starting from @xmath115 .",
    "we then find that @xmath116 such @xmath108 lead to the estimate @xmath117    more generally , if the above matrix element begins to diverge for some value @xmath118 , the formulas are to be replaced by : @xmath119    @xmath120    notice that this @xmath96 is smaller than the last retained term in the ope series which is of order @xmath121 .",
    "therefore the duality violation is just smaller than the last retained term as for the asymptotic series .",
    "this means in fact that there is _ no indication of duality violation at this computable order_. this is independent of @xmath106 , therefore of the _ large distance behavior of the potential_.",
    "summarizing our results , the amplitude @xmath24 - the t - product , eq .",
    "( [ tproduct ] ) - can be expanded in inverse powers of @xmath122 , the so - called ope expansion .",
    "exact duality would mean that the ope series was convergent and equal to @xmath15 .",
    "actually , this is not exactly the case . even in the favourable case of the _ regular potentials _",
    "( at @xmath123 ) , the ope series is not convergent , it is only asymptotic to the actual @xmath15 . for _ singular potentials _ , the coefficients are simply infinite beyond a certain order .    besides these problems concerning the amplitude , additional problems appear for the expansion of the width , which is given by a contour integral of @xmath15 in the @xmath1 complex plane : the ope expansion is accurate far from the singularities in @xmath1 , while the contour has fixed end points in the complex plane close to the singularities ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in view of this situation ,",
    "we have computed explicitly the difference between the ope and the actual width . for singular potentials , the series must be truncated , and the difference is found smaller than the last retained term .    as to the perspectives opened by this work , we must first emphasize that singular potentials seem more interesting than regular ones . indeed , in qcd the effective quark potential is singular , a smoothed coulomb singularity .",
    "moreover , in @xmath97 , one can suspect some similarity with a linear potential @xmath124 , which is also singular at the origin in the sense of this paper .",
    "for a singular potential , we have seen that the entire series must be truncated at some order , because the coefficients become eventually infinite .",
    "we think that such infinite coefficients in an entire series expansion correspond to the fact that the correct expansion is not entire but must include fractional powers and/or logarithms in the expansion parameter , i.e. @xmath125 . in qcd , one can argue that the operator matrix elements are finite due to renormalisation , but nevertheless the coefficients still contain logarithms of heavy masses . in the non - relativistic case , the object of the present paper , the method which has been followed does not lead to definite conclusions as regards duality for singular potentials : namely , to the order we are able to calculate in this paper , we find that there is no duality violation , but this leaves open the question of duality violation at some higher order .",
    ", one has demonstrated duality up to the order @xmath126 and it may be believed that duality has been fully demonstrated in higher orders @xcite .",
    "however , a comment is in order here . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the matrix element of the leading operator @xmath127 is dual to the sum of the widths of the full tower of resonances .",
    "therefore , one can suspect that there is a difference between the actual width and the ope , that is of higher order @xmath128 , corresponding to the extrapolated width of the kinematically forbidden states .",
    "this difference , however , has the same order @xmath128 as the matrix elements of the higher dimension operators @xcite .",
    "it was then _ assumed _ that both quantities are dual to each other , but the corresponding ope coefficients were not calculated and we have not found where this assumption was demonstrated . ] to proceed further , one would have to devise new methods to obtain the above conjectured generalized expansions .",
