    "<S> the employed device structure for ln optomechanical system is microdisk resonators which support high - q whispering gallery modes ( inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mechmode]a ) . we have developed a robust nano - fabrication technique ( see appendix ) to realize high - q ln microdisks . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mechmode]a shows a typical example of our fabricated microdisks with a radius of 6  @xmath5 and device thickness of 400 nm sitting on a 2 @xmath5 thick oxide pedestal . </S>",
    "<S> the fabrication process is optimized to produce a smooth device sidewall , which is critical for minimizing the scattering loss of the optical modes to achieve high optical q.    radiation pressure induced by the optical mode in the device couples strongly to the mechanical radial - breathing modes ( rbms ) ( inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mechmode]b ) whose dominant motion is along the radial direction of the microdisk . </S>",
    "<S> simulation by the finite - element method ( fem ) indicates the frequency of the fundamental rbm scales inversely with the device radius . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mechmode]b shows that shrinking the device radius below 7  @xmath5 is able to realize a high mechanical frequency above the vhf band ( @xmath6 300 mhz ) . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the 6-@xmath5 radius microdisk exhibits a mechanical frequency of @xmath7357 mhz with an effective motional mass of 152 pg . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of a smaller microdisk is the larger optomechanical coupling coefficient , which scales as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the optical resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed fem simulation shows that the microdisk with a radius of 6 @xmath5 exhibits @xmath10 28 ghz / nm for a telecom - band wavelength , which thus corresponds to a vacuum optomechanical coupling rate of @xmath11 for the interaction between the fundamental quasi - transverse - electric ( quasi - te ) mode and the fundamental rbm .    the fabricated 6-@xmath5 radius microdisk is characterized with the experimental setup ( shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ mechmode]c ) at room temperature and atmosphere ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ opticalq ] shows the optical transmission spectrum of the ln microdisk from 1470 to 1545 nm , which clearly exhibits different mode families of quasi - te modes with the lowest three radial orders . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental quasi - te modes with a free spectral range ( fsr ) of @xmath12 31 nm exhibit high optical q over the telecom band . the detailed cavity transmission spectra with lorentzian fitting ( insets of fig .  [ opticalq ] ) show high intrinsic optical qs of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the fundamental quasi - te modes at 1498 nm and 1529 nm , repectively .    </S>",
    "<S> to characterize the mechanical quality of the device , we tune the input laser to the optical cavity mode at 1498 nm and record the radio - frequency ( rf ) spectrum of the optical transmission . to enhance the optical transduction of mechanical motion , we increase the coupling depth of the cavity transmission to realize a loaded optical q of @xmath15 and lock the laser frequency half way into the cavity resonance at the blue - detuned side . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ tbm]a shows the transduced rf spectrum of the mechanical modes for the microdisk with negligible optomechanical dynamic backaction effect at low optical drop power of a few microwatts . </S>",
    "<S> we can clearly observe the fundamental and second - order rbms at 375.8 mhz and 1.029 ghz , respectively , which are within 10% of the simulated values . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tbm]b and c show their detailed thermal noise spectra with lorentzian fitting indicating that they have intrinsic mechanical linewidths of 70 and 294 khz , respectively , resulting in intrinsic mechanical qs of 5360 and 3500 while the device resides in the air . the high mechanical qs result from achieving a minimal radius ( @xmath16 100 nm ) of the supporting silica pedestal to dramatically suppress the clamping loss . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the mechanical modes exhibit frequency - quality ( @xmath17 ) products of @xmath18 and @xmath0 hz , which are the highest among the recent reported ln mechanical microresonators @xcite .    when the optical power increases at the current detuning condition , the optomechanical backaction becomes pronounced resulting in decreasing the mechanical damp rate of the fundamental rbm as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ backaction]a . by linear </S>",
    "<S> fitting , we can extract the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath19 , which agrees with the simulated value . to further investigate the optomechanical backaction , we record the rf spectrum ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> backaction]b ) by sweeping the laser frequency at the blue - detuned side while the input power is fixed at 330 @xmath1 , which clearly shows the amplification of the mechanical motion and optical tuning of the mechanical frequency . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ backaction]c shows the measured mechanical damp rate as a function of the normalized laser detuning , which agrees with the theoretical curve quite well . </S>",
    "<S> the observed optimal detuning for optomechanical amplification is at @xmath20 resulting in a much narrowed mechanical linewidth close to 20 khz , where @xmath21 is the photon decay rate of the loaded cavity . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ backaction]d shows that the measured mechanical frequency consistently decreases while the detuning approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the theoretical curve showing a slight frequency change due to the pure optical spring effect , the significant discrepency is due to the static thermal softening resulting from a reduction in the young s modulus of ln as the device temperature increases @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong dynamic backaction in the ln microdisk implies a correspondingly efficient amplification of the mechanical motion on the blue - detuned side of the cavity resonance , resulting in regenerative optomechancial oscillation . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phononlaser]a , the rf spectrum of the fundamental rbm increases dramatically with increased input power , accompanied by a significant narrowing of the mechanical linewidth and a slight red shift in frequency . when the optical drop power is increased to 200 @xmath1 , the peak value of the mechanical spectral intensity </S>",
    "<S> is dramatically enhanced by more than 50 db . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis of the oscillation spectrum ( inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phononlaser]a ) shows that the mechanical linewidth is drastically suppressed down to 173 hz , corresponding to an effective mechanical q factor as high as @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phononlaser]b shows the oscillation spectrum with a much broader span , clearly exhibiting generation of a series of harmonics up to the fifith order , which is limited by the bandwidth of the high speed photo - detector .    by integrating the spectral area of the transduced mechanical spectrum at various drop powers </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the curve shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phononlaser]c , where the mechanical energy is normalized by the room - temperature thermal mechanical energy in the absence of dynamic backaction . </S>",
    "<S> it shows a clear phonon - lasing behavior where the mechanical energy remains rather small when the drop power is below a certain level but starts to increase dramatically and depends linearly on the drop power above the threshold . by linear </S>",
    "<S> fitting the above - threshold data , we obtain a threshold power of 174  @xmath1 , which agrees with the theoretical value ( see the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phononlaser]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the drop power increases further higher , the mechanical energy becomes saturated since the large mechanical displacement induces the cavity frequency shift larger than the cavity linewidth .    in summary , we have demonstrated chip - scale cavity optomechanics in lithium niobate for the first time , and the high performance of the demonstrated device shows great potential for sensing and metrology applications . </S>",
    "<S> the current optical q is still limited by the optical scattering loss and can be possibly further improved to above @xmath23 either by optimizing the fabrication process or by using a laser with a shorter wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by scaling down the dimension of the microdisk ( r @xmath24 ) or utilizing the optomechanical crystal structures @xcite , giant vacuum coupling rates and resolved - sideband regime can be achieved which are favorable for demonstration of various phenomena in quantum physics , such as quantum ground state cooling , optomechanically induced transparency , and squeezing of light and nanomechanical motion .    moreover , the demonstrated ln optomechanics provides a new route to realizing integrated electro - optic - mechanical hybrid systems in the near future . by taking advantage of the excellent piezoelectric properties of ln </S>",
    "<S> , we would be able to achieve a monolithic nanomechanical interface between microwave signals and optical photons enabling translation of quantum states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , incorporation of high - fidelity photon sources and electro - optic tunability on ln would create a new paradigm for integrated quantum photonics with diversified functionalities and provide great potential for broad applications in quantum communication , quantum computing and network . </S>"
