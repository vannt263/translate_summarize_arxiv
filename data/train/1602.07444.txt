    "majorana fermions have recently attracted much attention due to the potential application in topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "majorana fermions are particles that are their own antiparticles  in contrast with the case for dirac fermions  and obey non - abelian statistics@xcite .",
    "the exotic properties of majorana fermions have attracted increasing interest from researchersref1.4,ref1.5,ref1.6,ref1.7,ref1.9,ref1.10 .",
    "majorana fermions with zero energy ( majorana zero modes ) had been predicted to be induced by vortices in two - dimensional spinless @xmath0-wave superconductorref2,ref3,ref4 , or localize at the ends in a one - dimensional spin - polarized superconductor chain .",
    "another creative proposal is the interface of @xmath1-wave superconductors and topological insulators owing to the proximity effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin chain has been studied in depth both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it is known that the transverse - field ising model with z2 symmetry is equivalent to the one - dimensional spin - polarized superconductor model@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically study the non - abelian statistics of the zero - energy majorana fermions on the end of majorana chain and show its application to quantum computing by mapping it to a spin model with special symmetry .",
    "in particular , by using transverse - field ising model with z2 symmetry , we verify the nontrivial quantum statistics of majorana fermions numerically using a t - junction wire network , where the majorana fermions can be braided by tuning local gates .",
    "we may also mimic this t - type braiding in spin representation numerically , where the two zero - energy majorana fermion states correspond to two degenerate ground states of spin chain . in this way",
    ", we provide an easy way of detecting the fundamental non - abelian statistics of majorana fermions , which is useful to quantum computation .",
    "it has been recognized that a one - dimensional quantum spin model with z2 symmetry is equivalent to a one - dimensional superconductor via jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "therefore , we can describe a one - dimensional spin chain using either spin representation ( @xmath2-representation ) or fermion representation ( @xmath3-representation ) .",
    "thus , the majorana fermion and its statistic property can be represented in either representation .    here , we start from the one - dimensional ising chain with z2 symmetry . the hamiltonian of the ising spin chain is given by@xmath4where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the ising coupling constant between two nearest - neighbour ( nn ) sites @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the strength of external field on site @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the total lattice number of the ising chain .",
    "we then introduce the spin operators @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the z2 symmetry is charaterized by as spin rotation symmetry @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 thus , to guarantee the z2 symmetry , the external field should be along @xmath19-direction , or @xmath20 .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation is described by@xcite@xmath21where @xmath22 @xmath23 denote the creation and annihilation operators of dirac fermions and obey the anticommutation relation @xmath24 . by using jordan - wigner transformation ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26then , the majorana fermion is defined as @xmath27with @xmath28 @xmath29 . from the definition , one can see that majorana fermions are their own antiparticle and constitute half  of an ordinary fermion .",
    "we obtain the hamiltonian in the @xmath3-representation ref20,@xmath30    in the fermion representation for the hamiltonian , we see that two majorana fermions on one site @xmath11 are coupled and the coupling constant is @xmath9 ( e.g. , the double dark line links site a and site b inner the box @xmath31 in fig.1 ) and the two majorana fermions on the nn sites are linked by @xmath5 ( e.g. , the single dark line between boxes 1 , 2 and 3 in fig.1 ) . when we adiabatically turn off @xmath9 at all sites such that its value decreases from a certain value @xmath32 to zero ( @xmath33 ) , the majorana fermions of the chain are only coupled by @xmath5 terms except for the two majorana fermions at the ends ( e.g. , the green and blue balls in fig.1 ) .    to characterize the quantum states of majorana fermions , we introduce the creation and annihilation operators of dirac fermions , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the operators of dirac fermions are combined by two majorana fermions at nn sites , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the majorana fermions at the left ( right ) end of the chain @xmath36 @xmath37 remain unpaired and have zero energy@xcite . here , we focus on the edge fermion and have @xmath38it is obvious that the edge fermion has zero energy .",
    "we now define @xmath39 to be a many - body quantum state with occupied single particle states for @xmath40 and empty single particle states @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore introduce a majorana qubit that consists of two basis states @xmath42 @xmath43 defined asref6.1@xmath44",
    "in this part , we numerically study the quantum statistic of the majorana fermions located at the end of spin chain by using one - dimensional quantum ising model with z2 symmetry . to explore the quantum statistic of the majorana fermions ,",
    "we take a 4-spin ( i.e. , 8-@xmath3 ) system as an example and braid the majorana fermions @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 by seven steps using the t - type structure ( see the illustration in fig.1 ) , which is similar to the semiconducting wire networks in ref.@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath9 in the original hamiltonian are given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "we first choose the initial state with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , there must exit two unpaired majorana zero modes located at the left end @xmath52 ( green ball ) and right end @xmath53 ( blue ball ) of the majorana chain . here",
    "@xmath54 represents the initial time and @xmath55 for @xmath11-th step of braiding process .",
    "we denote the quantum states of majorana modes by @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system at @xmath59 is given by @xmath60    we then do the braiding process step by step ( see fig.1 ) : * ( a ) * @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( this means we adiabatically turn on @xmath63 and turn off @xmath64 simultaneously during the time period @xmath65 @xmath66 ) , then @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",

    "it is well known that the braiding of majorana modes changes not only the amplitude but also the phase of the modes .",
    "we next focus on the phase difference of @xmath56 @xmath88 before and after the adiabatic braiding process numerically .",
    "we diagonalize the initial hamiltonian @xmath89 in the @xmath3-representation and obtain two zero energy modes @xmath52 and @xmath90 .",
    "we then define a time - evolution operator @xmath91\\right\\ } , \\]]where @xmath92 is the time ordering operator",

    "in last section , we have verified the non - abelian statistics numerically in @xmath3-representation and construct a phase gate based on the qubits that is simple and easily understood@xcite .",
