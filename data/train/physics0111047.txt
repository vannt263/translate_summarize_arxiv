    "the interferometric gravitational wave detectors currently under construction by ligo@xcite , virgo@xcite , geo@xcite and tama@xcite are expected to reach strain sensitivity levels of @xmath4 at 150 hz over baselines of several hundred meters up to several kilometers@xcite . to achieve this sensitivity",
    "all of these interferometers implement a michelson laser interferometer enhanced by multiple coupled optical resonators@xcite .",
    "ligo implements a power - recycled michelson interferometer with fabry - perot arm cavities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . using optical cavities is essential in reaching the ultimate sensitivity goal but it requires an active electronic feedback system to keep them `` on resonance '' . the control system must keep the round - trip length of a cavity near an integer multiple of the laser wavelength so that light newly introduced into the cavity interferes constructively with light from previous round - trips . under these conditions the light inside the cavity builds up and",
    "the cavity is said to be on resonance@xcite . attaining high power buildup in the arm cavities",
    "also requires that minimal light is allowed to leave the system through the antisymmetric port , so that all the light is sent back in the direction of the laser where it is reflected back into the system by the power recycling mirror .",
    "hence , an additional feedback loop is needed to control the michelson phase so that the antisymmetric port is set on a dark fringe .",
    "it is important to distinguish low ( @xmath5  hz ) and high frequency behaviour of the instrument .",
    "the low frequency region is typically dominated by environmental influences many orders of magnitude larger than the designed sensitivity and in many cases also many orders of magnitude larger than what can be tolerated for stable operations .",
    "it is the high frequency regime which yields good sensitivity and which is used for detecting gravitational waves . to suppress low frequency disturbances many active feedback control systems",
    "are needed to compensate 4 longitudinal@xcite and 14 angular@xcite degrees - of - freedom in the main interferometer alone .",
    "additional feedback compensation networks are needed to locally damp the suspended mirrors ( @xmath6 dofs ) , to control the mode cleaner ( 5 dofs ) and to control the laser ( 2 dofs ) .    for example",
    ", seismic motion of the ground@xcite is many orders of magnitude larger than the required gravitational wave sensitivity . in ligo",
    "a multi - stage passive seismic isolation stack@xcite together with a single - stage pendulum suspension system@xcite is used to isolate the optical components from ground vibrations .",
    "this system system works well for frequencies above @xmath7 , but gives no suppression at frequencies of a hz and below .",
    "in order to implement feedback each degree - of - freedom which is under control of the compensation network has to be measurable .",
    "ligo implements the pound - drever - hall reflection locking technique@xcite to keep cavities on resonance and a variant of this technique is used to control the angular degrees - of - freedom@xcite .",
    "these techniques work well near resonance where they behave linearly but have a strong non - linear behaviour far way from resonance giving no or misleading signals .",
    "the first step of engaging the feedback compensation network is to catch the system on resonance with a highly sophisticated computer code@xcite running on a digital controls system .    a schematic view of the length control system for the common mode degrees - of - freedom is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the signal @xmath8 measuring the common arm length of the interferometer is fed back to a combination of test masses , mode cleaner length and laser frequency to achieve the required laser frequency noise suppression of @xmath9 in the frequency band of interest . to maintain maximum optical power in the system  and thus maximum signal to shot noise ratio ",
    "the control system must hold the common cavity length within @xmath10 of its resonance point .",
    "a similar but less complicated system is deployed to control the differential degrees - of - freedom .",
    "their the differential arm cavity length has to be held within @xmath11 of its operating point to not pollute the gravitational wave signal with laser frequency noise .    ,",
    "is split into two paths : the mode cleaner length path  ( 1 ) feeding back to the position of a mode cleaner mirror , @xmath12 , and the laser path  ( 2 ) feeding back to the laser frequency , @xmath13 , using the vco / aom . the in - phase reflection signal , @xmath14 , of the interferometer ( ifo ) is split into four paths : the arm cavity path  ( 3 ) feeding back to the common arm cavity mirror positions , @xmath15 , the additive offset ( ao ) path  ( 4 ) feeding back to the error point of the mode cleaner control system , the mode cleaner length offset path  ( 5 ) feeding back to the mode cleaner mirror position , @xmath16 , and the tidal path  ( 6 ) feeding back to the reference cavity length , @xmath17 , using the thermal actuator .",
    "the in - phase signal at the power recycling cavity port , @xmath18 , is mostly sensitive to the power recycling cavity length , @xmath19 , and is feed back to the recycling mirror position  ( 7 ) .",
    "the numbers in the feedback paths indicate unity gain frequencies in hertz.,width=302 ]",
    "so far ligo has successfully demonstrated that the interferometer can be locked and kept on resonance for hours .",
    "the main goal in the near term is to improve the sensitivity which is still many orders of magnitude away from design , to engage the remaining feedback control paths and to fine - tune servo parameters .",
