    "pattern formations in diffusion fields have been studied as a typical nonlinear and nonequilibrium problem.@xcite the dendrite is a typical pattern observed in crystal growth . the tip velocity and the shape near the tip region",
    "have been intensively studied .",
    "the growth law of the dendrite is expressed as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the tip velocity and @xmath3 is the radius of curvature of the parabolic tip.@xcite the parabolic structure of the dendritic tip is linearly stable and the formation of sidebranches is considered to be due to some noise effects.@xcite perturbations are expected to grow as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance from the dendritic tip,@xcite and they grow into sidebranches .",
    "well - developed sidebranches can be easily observed in experiments of succinonitrile and nh@xmath6cl .",
    "there are some quantitative investigations about the well - developed sidebranches .",
    "huang and glicksman investigated the development of sidebranches in an experiment of succinonitrile.@xcite they found that the sidebranching spacing , which is the interval between neighboring active sidebranches , grows in a power law of exponent 1.3 as a function of distance from the dendritic tip .",
    "they found the angle of the envelope with respect to the main branch increases as a function of the distance from the tip until 41@xmath0 .",
    "they expected that the angle increases up to 45@xmath0 finally , where the sidebranches grow with the same velocity as the main branch .",
    "li and beckermann analyzed the shape of the envelope of the sidebranches for succinonitrile on the microgravity flight and found that the envelope grows with a power law of exponent 0.859 as a function of the distance from the dendritic tip.@xcite the exponent is less than 1 , and it implies that the envelope angle decreases as a function of distance from the tip , which is different from the observation by huang and glicksman .",
    "recently , honda and honjo are investigating the shape of the sidebranches of kinetic dendrites in viscous fingering on the plate with many grooves of square symmetry.@xcite theoretically , well - developed sidebranches have not been studied in detail .",
    "we will study well - developed sidebranches using a coupled map lattice model .",
    "we proposed a coupled map lattice model as a simple simulation method for crystal growth and succeeded in generating various patterns such as dla , dbm and dendrites.@xcite the dendrite with anisotropic surface tension obeys the growth law @xmath1 also in our coupled map lattice , when the undercooling is sufficiently small.@xcite the model is a deterministic model similar to the phase field model.@xcite our coupled map lattice models involves the kinetic effect and we have not succeeded in removing the kinetic effect as in the phase - field model by karma and rappel.@xcite however , our coupled map model is much simpler and numerically preferable for a large scale simulation even at small undercooling such as @xmath7 .",
    "previously , different types of coupled map lattice models were proposed by kaneko and kessler et al.@xcite their coupled map lattice models may be interpreted as direct discretization of the phase - field models , but they have not reported dendritic growth . our model is a simpler model , in that only the linear diffusion process is assumed in lattice points other than interface sites .",
    "packard and li - godenfeld proposed cellular automaton models for the crystal growth.@xcite in their cellular automaton models , the order parameter takes 0 ( liquid ) or 1 ( solid ) . in our coupled map lattice model",
    ", the order parameter takes a continuous value between 0 and 1 at the interface sites .",
    "the interface grows therefore more smoothly than the cellular automaton models .",
    "our coupled map lattice model is considered to be a preferable model compared to the previous coupled map lattice models and cellular automaton models .",
    "we will perform numerical simulation of dendrites using the coupled map lattice model to study the growth law of the envelope .     and",

    "we consider melt growth of crystal with four - fold rotational symmetry .",
    "our model consists of two steps of time evolution on a square lattice .",
    "the four - fold rotational symmetry of crystal is involved in performing the simulation on the square lattice .",
    "if the triangular lattice is used , a pattern like a snowflake with the six - fold rotational symmetry grows as shown in the previous paper.@xcite the first step is a diffusion process and the second step is a growth process at the interface .",
    "the diffusion process of the latent heat released at the interface is expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes a dimensionless temperature , @xmath15 is the step number , @xmath16 denotes the lattice point and @xmath17 is a diffusion constant .",
    "this process is interpreted as the simplest discretization of the laplacian .",
    "the second step is a growth process at the interface .",
    "the order parameter is expressed with the variable @xmath18 , where @xmath18 is 0 in the liquid phase and 1 in the solid phase .",

    "this growth process is done only at the interface sites , and @xmath22 for the other sites keep the values @xmath23 at the previous step .",
    "when @xmath18 goes over a threshold @xmath24 , the interface site changes into a solid site . the diffusion process ( 1 ) and the growth process ( 2 ) at the interface",

    "the initial temperature is assumed to be @xmath25 .",
    "then , the normalized undercooling @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "we have set a seed of crystal at the origin as an initial condition . to save computation time",

    "( a stable parabolic structure is obtained if the term for the surface tension is included in this model as shown in ref.11 . )",
    "our dendrite is therefore a kinetic dendrite , since the growth direction is determined by the kinetic anisotropy.@xcite our simulation may be closely related to the experiment by honda and honjo , since they investigate kinetic dendrites in two dimensions .",
    "figure 1 displays snapshot patterns of dendrites for ( a ) @xmath30 and ( b ) @xmath10 . to include small noise effect ,",
    "we have assumed that the threshold @xmath31 at the tip site ( only one site ) takes a random value between 0.99 and 1.01 .",

    "the sidebranches which locate in @xmath32 are not shown .",
    "the sidebranches are more developed for @xmath30 than for @xmath10 , since the undercooling is large .",
    "we have calculated the envelope line for each snapshot pattern and constructed an average curve of the envelope for @xmath33 and 0.9 . in our numerical simulation , an envelope of sidebranches",
    "is defined as the line which connects the tip positions of active sidebranches .",
    "a sidebranch is judged as active if it is larger than the neighboring active sidebranch locating in the left of itself ( with smaller @xmath34 ) . as a result of our definition ,",
    "the envelope is a monotonously increasing function .",
    "a relevant length scale of our model is the diffusion length @xmath35 .",
    "the tip velocities are numerically obtained respectively as 0.0058,0.0081,0.0124 and 0.0227 for @xmath36 and 0.3 .",
    "the velocities do not obey the law @xmath37 like the surface tension dendrite in two dimensions , but seem to obey @xmath38 for the kinetic dendrites in our model .",

    "( we have performed numerical simulation with larger size @xmath40 only for @xmath12 , since the development of sidebranches is slow at the parameter . ) the envelope for @xmath30 can be approximated as @xmath41 for large @xmath5 .",
    "that means that the angle of the envelope with respect to the @xmath5-direction approaches 45@xmath0 .",
    "the envelopes overlap with each other rather well , especially , the envelope for @xmath12 overlaps with that for @xmath10 very well",
    ". there may exist a universal scaling function for the envelope function for sufficiently small undercooling .",
    "figure 2(b ) displays logarithmic plots of the envelope functions for @xmath10 and 0.9 . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "the envelope is approximated as @xmath42 , where the sidebranches are not well developed and the parabolic structure of the tip region is maintained .",
    "for relatively larger @xmath5 , the envelope , roughly speaking , obeys a power law with exponent about 1.4 .",
    "however , the envelope in the logarithmic scale has a tendency to curve upwards as @xmath5 is increased .",
    "the derivative @xmath43 is calculated and displayed in fig .  3 for @xmath11 and 0.9 .",
    "the derivative is about 0.5 for small @xmath5 , which corresponds to the parabolic shape , however , it increases from 1.2 to 1.9 in the intermediate region as @xmath5 is increased .",
    "this implies that the envelope does not obey a simple power law .",
    "we have also calculated the spacing between neighboring active sidebranches and obtained the average curve of the spacing between the active sidebranches as a function of the distance from the tip position .",
    "figure 4 displays the average spacing @xmath44 for @xmath10 and 0.9 as a function of the scaled distance @xmath5 .",
    "the two curves again overlap very well .",
    "the sidebranch spacing is almost a linear function of @xmath5 . by the fitting to a power law @xmath45 , the exponent @xmath46 is evaluated to be about 1.15 .",
    "the sidebranch spacing increases with the distance from the tip position because of the competition among sidebranches .",
    "smaller sidebranches stop to grow and the survived sidebranches become larger .",
    "competitive processes between survived large sidebranches go on further , until the spacing between the sidebranches becomes sufficiently larger than the diffusion length .    .",

    "we have performed a numerical simulation in a square box of @xmath52 .",
    "we have imposed periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath34 direction such as @xmath53 at @xmath54 and 0 , and fixed boundary conditions such as @xmath55 at @xmath56 and no - flux boundary conditions @xmath57 at @xmath58 . as an initial condition for a linear seed",

    "many small dendritic branches are created initially , but the number of growing branches decreases in time by the competitive interaction between the neighboring branches .",
    "the velocities of delayed branches decrease and finally become almost zero .",
    "large branches seen in fig .",
    "5(a ) are survived branches for the competitive process .",
    "figure 5(b ) displays contour lines of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "the ensemble average with respect to 20 different initial conditions is taken .",
    "the form of this time evolution is similar to the envelope of sidebranches shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we have compared the two curves by rescaling the coordinates .",
    "the step number @xmath15 can be converted into a length by @xmath65 where @xmath2 is the tip velocity of the main stem and the scaled coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath67 are used in fig .",

    "the two plots overlap very well , although the numerical factor 0.67 is suitably chosen .",
    "we have also calculated the time evolution of the average interval @xmath70 between active branches for the crystal growth starting from a linear seed . here , the active branches at step @xmath15 are chosen as the branches whose tip positions are larger than @xmath71 .",
    "the average interval between active branches increases almost in proportion to @xmath15 , which corresponds to the linear growth of the sidebranch spacing shown in fig .",
    "4 . figure 6(c ) compares the time evolution of the rescaled quantity @xmath72 as a function of @xmath69 ( solid curve ) with the average spacing between active sidebranches shown in fig .  4 for @xmath10 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "( the numerical factor 0.8 is again suitably chosen . )",
    "the good agreement of two plots in fig .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) implies that the competitive dynamics among dendritic branches starting from a linear seed and that for sidebranches in the region far from the dendritic tip are essentially the same .",
    "the tip velocity of the largest branch is small at small @xmath15 and it increases with time as is seen in fig .",
    "this is because the spacings between the survived branches increase with time and the tip velocities become larger for the larger spacing . to understand the relation between the tip velocity and the spacing between the branches , we have performed numerical simulations in a rectangular box of size @xmath73 with periodic boundary conditions in the direction of @xmath5 . as an initial condition ,",
    "we have put a small branch of size @xmath74 at @xmath75 and @xmath76 . since we have assumed periodic boundary conditions , the growth condition is equivalent to the case involving many branches , which have completely the same size and are periodically located with the same interval @xmath51 , in an infinitely wide system .",
    "the system size @xmath77 is fixed to be 700 , and @xmath51 is changed from 10 to 120 , and the parameter @xmath9 is 0.7 .",
    "figure 7(a ) displays the time evolution of the tip position of the branch in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the time evolution seems to obey a power law @xmath78 with exponent 0.7 in fairly wide region of @xmath79 . in a narrow channel , the steady growth of dendrite",
    "is not possible when the undercooling is small .",
    "brener et al . investigated the parameter region for the existence of steadily growing dendrites.@xcite figure 7(b ) displays numerically evaluated exponents @xmath50 as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "the flat interface grows with a power law of exponent 1/2 , which is shown theoretically and was numerically shown also in our coupled map lattice in the previous paper,@xcite which corresponds to the limit of @xmath80 .",
    "inversely , the exponent becomes 1 , when the undercooling and the spacing @xmath51 are larger than a certain threshold , and the steady growth becomes possible .",
    "figure 7(b ) shows that the exponent increases with the spacing @xmath51 for our kinetic dendrites .    in the crystal growth from a linear seed ,",
    "the interface is almost flat and the growth exponent is nearly 1/2 in an initial stage .",
    "then , many small branches are created . at this stage , the branch spacing is small , the growth is slow , and the growth exponent is still close to 1/2 .",
    "as the competitive process proceeds , the average spacing between active branches increases as a result of competition , and the tip velocities of the survived branches increase further . in this time scale",
    ", the tip position seems to grow like a power law with exponent larger than 1 .",
    "the exponents of the power law may be evaluated roughly as follows . if the tip velocity @xmath81 grows in a power law with exponents @xmath50 as shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) , the exponents depend on the average spacing @xmath82 , and the average spacing @xmath82 increases roughly as @xmath83 , the tip position will grow as @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath50 grows as @xmath85 for small @xmath79 with a certain constant @xmath86 , @xmath87 and the exponent for the tip position is evaluated as @xmath88 for small @xmath79 , although this is a very rough approximation .",
    "if the spacing becomes comparable or larger than the diffusion length , the tip velocities of survived branches approach the constant tip velocity for a single branch in an infinitely wide system .",
    "we have performed a large scale numerical simulation of kinetic dendrites with a coupled map lattice model .",
    "well - developed sidebranches have appeared in the coupled map lattice .",
    "many sidebranches are naturally created and the competitive dynamics among sidebranches determines the shape of the envelope .",
    "the envelope has a parabolic shape near the tip of the dendrite , and the angle of the envelope with respect to the main stem grows up to 45@xmath0 finally . in an intermediate region",
    ", the envelope grows , roughly speaking , in a power law , however , the exponent seems to increase gradually as a function of the distance from the tip .",
    "similar competitive dynamics among many dendritic branches is observed in the unidirectional growth .",
    "we could compare quantitatively the temporal evolution of the unidirectional growth with the envelope of sidebranches as a function of the distance from the tip position .",
    "the temporal evolution of a single branch in a narrow rectangular box seems to obey a power law in a wide range of @xmath79 .",
    "the exponent increases with the width of the rectangular box .",
    "the width can be interpreted to correspond to the spacing betweeen the sidebranches for the dendritic growth . as a result of the competition among sidebranches ,",
    "the spacing between the active sidebranches increases , and then the tip velocities of the sidebranches are accelerated further . when the spacing becomes sufficiently large , the tip velocities of the active branches become nearly equal to the tip velocity of a single branch in an infinitely wide system .",
    "we have calculated numerically the spacing @xmath44 and the envelope @xmath89 of sidebranches .",
    "the competitive dynamics among the active sidebranches via the diffusion field determines @xmath44 and @xmath89 . expecting that the large scale competitive dynamics may not depend on the surface tension effect and",
    "we have neglected it in this paper .",
    "the surface tension is important to determine the tip radius and the tip velocity as in the experiments by glicksman et al .",
    "it is not difficult to involve the surface tension effect in our model .",
    "however , the surface tension effect makes the parabolic shape of the dendrites stable , and strong noises are necessary to construct well - developed sidebranches .",
    "it is a future problem to study the sidebranch structure for the surface tension dendrites .",
