    "the issue of the final state of gravitational collapse is important from various points of view .",
    "usually we expect the black holes will eventually form after the gravitational collapse of a star and the spacetime is expected to asymptotically converge to a stationary or static state .",
    "the perturbation analysis @xcite and numerical demonstrations support this picture . as a consequence",
    ", the limiting spacetime will be a stationary or static vacuum spacetime if all the matter is absorbed to the thus produced black hole .",
    "nowadays we know that the uniqueness theorem for black holes holds in asymptotically flat , stationary ( or static ) and vacuum spacetimes and the resulting spacetimes are described by kerr or schwarzschild solutions @xcite",
    ". therefore we can have definite astrophysical predictions using these exact solutions .",
    "while the uniqueness of the vacuum black hole has been established , it is interesting to ask if there is a uniqueness theorem for stationary or static spacetimes of a black hole plus matter . in the stationary case ( i.e.",
    ", time translation symmetry exists but their trajectories are not hypersurface orthogonal ) , clearly this is not the case because many spacetime solutions have been constructed .",
    "the perturbative solution of a slowly rotating black hole surrounded by an infinitesimal ring was constructed by will  @xcite .",
    "there are numerical solutions of a black hole surrounded by an infinitely thin disk  @xcite or by an differentially rotating ring  @xcite .",
    "recently , the black hole with a uniformly rotating ring around it has been calculated with high accuracy  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we expect that there should be some kind of uniqueness theorem for static spacetimes ( i.e. , trajectories of time - translation symmetry are hypersurface orthogonal ) of a black hole with matter .",
    "this is because if we try to put the matter at rest outside a black hole , it is expected to fall into the black hole because of the gravitational attraction .",
    "however , we would like to point out that this intuitive picture does not have a rigorous reasoning .",
    "in fact , one can easily provide a counterexample as follows .",
    "if an infinitely thin disc composed of counter - rotating particles exists on the equatorial plane of the black hole spacetime , there should exist a static configuration after a fine tuning of system parameters .",
    "this example indicates that the uniqueness of spacetimes of a black hole with matter depends not only on the energy condition but also the equation of state matter satisfies .",
    "as far as we know , there is bekenstein s work @xcite which proves the nonexistence of scalar fields outside a black hole in the static spacetime .",
    "however , without assuming the spherical symmetry , the question of nonexistence of matter composed of an ordinary perfect fluid outside a black hole in the static spacetime has not been addressed up to now .",
    "as it turns out , proving the uniqueness in the setting above is rather a delicate problem .",
    "a similar situation is found for the proof of the spherical symmetry of a static isolated star composed of perfect fluid for a certain class of equations of state .",
    "this problem was solved relatively recently by lindblom and masood - ul - alam @xcite after a long history @xcite . in the work of @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the condition that should hold inside of a star _ without _ assuming the spherical symmetry and proved the conformal flatness of the space that directly implies the spherical symmetry in turn .",
    "fortunately , many of the results in @xcite can be used for our situation because much of their analysis was done in quite a general setting . in this paper",
    "we would like to reformulate the analysis of @xcite for the goal of showing the uniqueness of the static spacetime of a black hole plus matter , taking care of the difference between the two setups .",
    "we will provide a partial proof for the non - existence of matter outside a static black hole .",
    "the non - existence we obtain here is conditional under an inequality between the black - hole mass and the stellar mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide our setup concerning the einstein equation . in sec.iii , we summarize the results of lindblom and masood - ul - alam  @xcite , paying particular attention to the part that are directly relevant to our argument .",
    "we prove our theorem in sec.iv and summarize our paper with some discussion in sec.v .",
    "we adopt the unit of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the static spacetime which has the metric @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the induced metric of \\ { @xmath4 const . }",
    "hypersurfaces @xmath5 . in a static spacetime , its event horizon @xmath6",
    "is identified with killing horizon \\{@xmath7 } and thus @xmath8 vanishes on the horizon .",
    "we assume that there is a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath9 and pressure @xmath10 .",
    "the fluid is assumed to satisfy an equation of state @xmath11 .",
    "we assume the surface of the star / fluid is a two - dimensional closed connected equipotential surface @xmath12 for some positive constant @xmath13 .",
    "the einstein equation and equation for fluid are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the covariant derivative and ricci tensor of the metric @xmath3 .",
    ".   indicates that the surface @xmath17 is identical to the surface @xmath18 let us suppose for the moment the condition @xmath19 at the horizon .",
    "except for the extremal charged black holes , this condition is satisfied in all the known static black hole solutions",
    ".   says that the value of @xmath20 diverges at the horizon if matter exists at the horizon @xmath21 , which is an unphysical situation .",
    "hence , this would make the stellar surface disjoint from the horizon .",
    "we stress that the same conclusion can be obtained from eq . without any additional hypothesis . as eq .",
    "is elliptic , a standard boundary elliptic estimate ( see , for example , lemma 6.4 in gilbarg - trudinger @xcite ) says that near the horizon , the norm of the gradient of @xmath22 is bounded by the sup norm of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 00 ] ) as well as that of @xmath22 , both of which are uniformly bounded in our case . as the horizon is the zero set of @xmath22 ,",
    "while the surface of the star is the level set @xmath23 , the gradient bound for @xmath22 provides a positive lower bound ( dependent on @xmath13 ) for the distance between those two level sets , which in turn implies that the star is disjoint from the horizon .    at the moment pictures such as fig.1",
    "are possible configurations of our setup .",
    "although the star surface shown in this figure is spherical , note that its topology is arbitrary as long as it is specified as a connected equipotential surface @xmath24 .",
    "thus our theorem will hold also for , e.g. , a barotropic perfect fluid ring .    here",
    "we stress that we will prove that such configurations as above do _ not _ occur under certain conditions . in doing so , we are also _ not _ assuming any symmetry of the spacelike slice .",
    "asymptotic flatness requires the following asymptotic behavior of @xmath22 and the metric @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the adm mass .",
    "our strategy for the proof is as follows .",
    "we first show that the @xmath29 hypersurface @xmath5 is conformally flat .",
    "the main part of the proof is finding appropriate conformal transformations for @xmath5 so that it becomes a hypersurface with zero adm mass and non - negative ricci scalar curvature .",
    "this wonderful idea was first introduced by bunting and masood - ul - alam @xcite .",
    "we then apply the positive energy theorem @xcite to this surface to conclude that the surface is flat euclidean space . in turn , the original hypersurface @xmath5 is conformally flat and it will immediately follow that @xmath30 . in order to find the appropriate conformal transformation , we will use the lindblom and masood - ul - alam s theorems @xcite that was used for proving the spherical symmetry of a static star .",
    "we review it in the next section .",
    "in this section , we briefly review lindblom and masood - ul - alam s results @xcite where the spherical symmetry of static stellar models was obtained under a certain condition on the equation of state .",
    "we are able to transcribe their argument mostly because the techniques used in treating the _ inside _ of stars are identical .    because the @xmath31 surface is identical to @xmath32 surface due to eq .   and the equation of state @xmath33 ,",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are regarded as functions of @xmath22 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath22 in the star is denoted by @xmath34 . then quantities @xmath35 , @xmath36 are defined as the solutions to the equations @xmath37 @xmath38 where the boundary conditions for eqs .",
    "( [ remark12 ] ) and ( [ remark13 ] ) are @xmath39 @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is some constant suitably chosen in the proof . as we see from eqs .   and , @xmath42 holds and @xmath41 could be interpreted as the local mass of the star . now @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 various lemmas on @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath45 are introduced , such as the existence of the solution on @xmath46 $ ] for some @xmath47 ( lemma 1 - 3 ) . in particular , assuming that the pressure is finite @xmath48 , @xmath49 can be positive for somewhat small @xmath41 over the interval @xmath50 $ ] ( lemma 8) .",
    "we require that the equation of state satisfies at least one of the following constraints .",
    "@xmath51 or @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath55 in the condition ( [ conb ] ) implies that the adiabatic index @xmath56 must be less than or equal to @xmath57 . under this assumption , the following quantity @xmath58 is proved to be non - negative ( lemma 10 @xcite ) .",
    "the most important technical result is lemma 6 in @xcite : _ assuming that @xmath59 and @xmath60 on @xmath61 $ ] , then @xmath62 on @xmath63 holds everywhere _ holds on @xmath61 $ ]",
    ". however , we can easily see from the proof that it holds everywhere outside of the star . ] _ and @xmath64_. because this lemma is relevant to our problem , we briefly review its proof . in @xcite , a differential inequality of elliptic type in the exterior vacuum region",
    "is derived : @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 is some positive constant to be chosen later .",
    "the appropriate boundary condition at infinity is @xmath68 . from the maximum principle",
    ", @xmath69 has the maximum value at the infinity or at the surface of the star @xmath70 . the possibility of maximum value of @xmath71 occurring at @xmath24 is then removed by choosing @xmath67 appropriately .",
    "thus @xmath72 holds everywhere and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath64 is directly derived from the asymptotic expansion of @xmath73 .",
    "note here that in our case where the black hole is additionally present , the possibility that @xmath74 takes a maximal value at the event horizon can not be removed , and we can not use lemma 6 in @xcite without modifications .",
    "we will come back to this point in the next section .",
    "they next introduce @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath75 satisfies @xmath77 and @xmath78 on @xmath79 $ ] while @xmath76 satisfies @xmath80 with @xmath81 at a point @xmath82 .",
    "the existence of @xmath83 is guaranteed by , e.g. , lemma 6  @xcite .",
    "then , they defined @xmath84 by @xmath85 where @xmath86:w_\\mu > 0~{\\rm on}~(v_c , v_s]~{\\rm and}~w_\\mu(v_c)=0   \\rbrace$ ] .    in their lemma 14 , they proved that @xmath87 is positive , where @xmath88 is defined as the solution to the equation @xmath89 with @xmath90 at the surface of the star @xmath91 .",
    "finally they define a conformal metric @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and found that the ricci scalar has the expression @xmath94 where @xmath95 . precisely , we must take care of the differential structure at the center of stars . as the argument is rather technical ,",
    "we refer this point to _ lemma 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 _ and the main theorem in ref .",
    "] by lemma 6 and 14 , this is positive , while the space has zero adm mass . here",
    "the case of equality in the positive energy theorem can be applied and we conclude that the space is conformally flat , which then implies that an isolated star is spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "now we turn our attention to the proof of non - existence of matter outside a static black hole .",
    "the various functions _ inside _ of a star , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath49 and @xmath99 can be introduced without modifications .",
    "we adopt the same condition on the equation of state .",
    "however , the modification for lemma 6 is required as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "lemma 6 in @xcite says that @xmath100 holds everywhere . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "this inequality was proved by showing @xmath101 at @xmath102 and by applying the maximum principle for the inequality @xmath103 which indicates that @xmath104 at infinity is the maximum value .",
    "however , presently we have an additional boundary , which is the horizon @xmath105 , and a possibility of @xmath106 there remains .",
    "we thus have to _ assume _ @xmath101 at the horizon or equivalently @xmath107 we will discuss the physical meaning of this hypothesis in the last section . under this assumption , @xmath108 is guaranteed everywhere , and the results in @xcite that was proven using lemma 6 become available . in particular ,",
    "the existence of @xmath84 is guaranteed .",
    "now we show the conformal flatness of this space .",
    "consider the two conformal transformations defined by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the same as eq .   and @xmath111 now we have two manifolds @xmath112 . as in bunting and masood - ul - alam @xcite",
    ", we can make a smooth manifold out of @xmath113 by gluing along @xmath105 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of each metric is ; @xmath114 and @xmath115 in the manifold @xmath116 , @xmath117 corresponds to a regular point in a 3-dimensional surface .",
    "indeed , introducing a new coordinate @xmath118 , the metric near @xmath119 can be written as @xmath120 if the ricci scalar of this space is non - negative , positive energy theorem tells us that @xmath113 is the flat euclidean space and thus @xmath5 is conformally flat , because this manifold has the zero adm mass and non - negative ricci scalar .",
    "hence we want to show the non - negativity of the ricci scalars @xmath121 .",
    "the three - dimensional ricci scalar becomes the same as for @xmath122 and @xmath123 \\geq 0 , \\label{ricci-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath125 holds as above , it remains to show the non - negativity of @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath127 is guaranteed by lemma 14 in @xcite and @xmath128 is guaranteed by the hypothesis .",
    "then the conformally transformed space @xmath113 has non - negative ricci scalar ( see eq .",
    "( [ ricci+ ] ) ) and zero adm mass , which implies that @xmath129 is flat .",
    "now we have proven under the assumption that the original space @xmath5 is conformally flat .",
    "going back to eqs .   and , we find that @xmath130 holds and they in turn imply @xmath131 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the latter implies that the spacetime should be vacuum .",
    "our result excludes any static configurations of a black hole with a star whose surface is given by @xmath24 as was suggested in fig.1 .",
    "we summarize what we have obtained as the following theorem : + * theorem : * _ in asymptotically flat static black hole spacetimes , the star , which is composed of a perfect fluid satisfying the dominant energy condition and has the surface of level surface set @xmath132 , can not exist if ( i ) the equations of state @xmath11 satisfies the condition or , and ( ii ) for @xmath49 defined by eq . with eqs . and",
    ", the inequality @xmath133 holds on the event horizon ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "_    as a result , the ordinary uniqueness theorem  @xcite of vacuum spacetimes can be applied and then the spacetime in our setup is reduced to the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we have proven the non - existence of matter composed of a perfect fluid under the hypothesis @xmath134 . because the physical meaning of this hypothesis is still unclear ,",
    "we examine it in this section . on the event horizon ,",
    "the value of @xmath135 coincides with the surface gravity @xmath136 of the black hole .",
    "we introduce the komar integral on the event horizon @xmath137 that indicates the local mass of the black hole , where @xmath138 is the area of the horizon",
    ". then , @xmath139 corresponds to @xmath140 the first law of the black hole thermodynamics for the static spacetime @xmath141 implies @xmath142 .",
    "hence @xmath143 and the right hand side of the inequality is @xmath144 . in order to find some upper bound on @xmath41 in terms of the quantities of the star , recall that @xmath145 holds on the surface of the star as appeared in the proof of lemma 6 of @xcite",
    "this is rewritten as @xmath146 . integrating over the surface of the star , we find @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the komar mass of the star and @xmath149 is the area of the surface of the star .",
    "hence , @xmath139 holds if @xmath150 in order to simplify this inequality , let us consider the situation where a ball - shaped star exists outside a black hole and the distance between them is sufficiently large . in this case",
    "@xmath151 is approximated as @xmath152 and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the radius of the star .",
    "then the inequality becomes @xmath155 therefore the main theorem states that a star with smaller mass than a black hole mass can not exist outside of the black hole in static spacetimes .",
    "intuitively , heavy stars are also not permitted to exist outside of black holes in static spacetimes .",
    "we hope to have a different argument for proving the statement because our current approach of adapting lindblom and masood - ul - alam s results @xcite is not expected to produce optimal statements .",
    "lastly we note that the star surface is assumed to be a surface of one connected component . in order to exclude the configuration of a star whose surface has two or more components such as a shell surrounding the black hole ,",
