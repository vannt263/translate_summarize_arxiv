    "the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) is one of the most populous dwarf spheroidal companions to the milky way , second only to the disrupting sagittarius dwarf .",
    "it shows evidence for a very extended history of star formation that ceased only a few million years ago ( e.g. gallart et al . 2005 ; coleman & de jong 2008 ) and a significant range of metallicity ( e.g. battaglia et al .",
    "it has its own system of five metal deficient globular clusters ( buonanno et al .",
    "1999 ; letarte et al .",
    "2006 ) , an extended asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) with numerous carbon stars ( e.g. westerlund , edvardsson & lundgren 1987 ; lundgren 1990 ) and evidence of substructure , possibly a consequence of merging with another galaxy ( coleman et al . 2004",
    "; olszewski et al .",
    "the young stars are more concentrated towards the centre of the galaxy ( coleman & de jong 2008 ) and there is an anti - correlation between the iron content and the velocity dispersion ( battaglia et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggestive of an age metallicity relation .",
    "this paper is one of a series aimed at finding and characterizing luminous agb variables within local group galaxies ; it follows similar work on leo i and phoenix ( menzies et al .",
    "2002 , 2008 ) . here",
    "we report on multi - epoch @xmath5 photometry which enables us to identify the agb variables within fornax .",
    "the large - amplitude variables , generally known as miras are of particular interest , first , because they tell us about the intermediate age population of which they are the most luminous representatives , secondly because they provide an independent distance calibration and thirdly because they will be major contributors to the processed material currently entering the interstellar medium of fornax and are therefore an important source of enrichment .",
    "estimates for the interstellar extinction towards fornax are mostly in the range @xmath6 mag ( e.g. greco et al . 2007 and references therein ) . here",
    "we use a value near the middle of this range , @xmath7 mag , which amounts to @xmath8 and is therefore almost negligible in our work .",

    "the dashed lines mark the boundaries of our fields and the dotted line shows the region covered by the shallow survey of gullieuszik et al .",
    "( 2008).,width=321 ]",
    "observations were made with the sirius camera on the japanese - saao infrared survey facility ( irsf ) at sutherland .",
    "the camera produces simultaneous @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 images covering what is typically a @xmath13 arcmin square field ( after dithering ) with a scale of 0.45 arcsec / pixel . to cover most of the fornax galaxy ,",
    "a @xmath14 grid was used , with successive image centres displaced by 7 arcmin in ra along a row and successive rows displaced by 7 arcmin in dec ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_pos ] ) .",
    "since the aim was to find long - period variables , observations were made at about 15 epochs spread over 3 years in the central @xmath15 grid ; poor weather and other constraints reduced this number to about 11 in the outer ring of 20 fields . in each field , 10 dithered images were combined after flat - fielding and dark and sky subtraction .",
    "typical exposures were of either 10 or 20s , depending on the seeing and on the brightness of the sky in the @xmath12 band .",
    "photometry was performed using dophot ( schechter et al .",
    "1993 ) in ` fixed - position ' mode , using the best - seeing @xmath11-band image in each field as templates .",
    "aladin was used to correct the coordinate system on each template and ra and dec were determined for each measured star .",
    "this allowed a cross - correlation to be made with the 2mass catalogue ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) , and photometric zero points were determined by comparison of our photometry with that of 2mass . in each field , stars in common with the 2mass catalogue with photometric quality a in each colour were identified and the irsf zero point was adjusted to match that of 2mass .",
    "the number of common stars per field varies from over 20 in the middle four fields to as few as four in field 26 ; only 5 fields have fewer than 7 stars in common with 2mass .",
    "the mean standard deviation over all fields of the differences between irsf and 2mass are 0.06 mag in @xmath10 and @xmath11 and 0.08 mag in @xmath12 .",
    "no account was taken of possible colour transformations , such as in kato et al .",
    "those transformations were derived using highly reddened objects to define the red end and it is not obvious that the same transformations will apply to carbon stars .    for a given field ,",
    "10 dithered frames were median averaged to produce an image for measurement .",
    "stars near the edge of a frame tend to have lower photometric precision since they might not have appeared on all 10 dithered frames .",
    "variables appearing in the overlap regions between fields may have been missed because of this effect , though this is unlikely for large amplitude very red variables .",
    "fig .  [ fig_cm ] shows the @xmath16 diagram and fig .",
    "[ fig_jhhk1 ] the @xmath17 diagram for stars selected as follows : for bright stars , i.e. those with @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 mag , standard deviations @xmath21 mag ; for fainter stars the limit depends on the magnitude : for @xmath22 it is @xmath23 , and for @xmath24 it is @xmath25 and for @xmath26 it is @xmath27 .",
    "mean magnitudes from all of our observations are used in all of these plots . selecting the stars in this way",
    "is intended to reject any poor quality photometry , but it also eliminates large amplitudes variables .",
    "the latter are extracted separately , by examining the light curves of the bright stars with large scatter , and are shown in the figures as different symbols .        .",
    "the dotted line represents the relation for galactic carbon miras ( equation 2 from whitelock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) approximately converted onto the 2mass system ( 2mass : @xmath28 ) .",
    "the other two lines are the same models as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] .",
    ", width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] foreground contamination is seen as a broad band with @xmath29 over the whole magnitude range with a few bluer points appearing at fainter magnitudes .",
    "unresolved galaxies provide background contamination and we can compare with the galaxies discussed by morris et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who list 2mass magnitudes for 228 confirmed galaxies with @xmath30 in the central 2.9 square degrees of the fornax cluster of galaxies .",
    "these are point sources with velocities which indicate that they are behind the fornax galaxy cluster .",
    "these sources , which have mean colours of @xmath31 mag and @xmath32 mag and a mean @xmath33 mag , are clearly magnitude limited . if the source density were the same behind the fornax dwarf spheroidal we would expect to see about thirty in our area of 0.4 square degrees .",
    "in fact in the sample illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] there is only one object with @xmath34 mag that stands clear from the dwarf spheroidal giant branch .",
    "what we do find is over 130 sources , with similar colours to the morris et al .",
    "sample , in the magnitude range @xmath35 mag ( magnitude limited at @xmath10 ) , i.e. about 1.5 mag fainter at @xmath12 than the morris et al . sources . in the two - colour diagram ,",
    "[ fig_jhhk1 ] , these sources can be seen to the right of the giant branch sources with the same mean colours as those of the morris et al .",
    "sample ( at 1.5 mag further the volume covered is 8 times larger ) .",
    "the most probable explanation of this is that we resolved galaxies of the brightness that were unresolved by morris et al . and therefore rejected them early on in our analysis that was focused on stars .",
    "indeed there are 2mass sources with colours and magnitudes similar to the morris et al .",
    "unresolved galaxies , which we do not find because they are resolved .",
    "the bulk of the stars fall on the fornax giant branch with @xmath36 mag , while the agb is represented by a group of stars immediately above the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) and by variable stars extending out to @xmath37 mag .",
    "the agb stars are discussed in detail below .",
    "it is clear that the trgb is sloped , being brighter at the red side ( @xmath38 mag at @xmath39 mag ) than at the blue side ( @xmath40 mag at @xmath41 mag ) .",
    "see also figs .",
    "[ fig_sp ] and [ fig_cmbw ] which show the trgb at a larger scale .",
    "this is to be expected in a galaxy which contains stars with a range of ages and metallicities .",
    "battaglia et al . ( 2006 ) find evidence for a young ( few hundred myr ) , an intermediate age ( 2 to 8 gyr ) and an old ( @xmath42 gyr ) population .",
    "the same authors quote earlier work as showing that the giant branch peaks at @xmath43\\sim -0.9 $ ] , but has a metal poor tail extending to @xmath43=-2 $ ] and a metal rich one extending beyond @xmath43=-0.4 $ ] .",
    "we anticipate that our own results will be dominated by the large intermediate age population .",
    "two models from marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are overplotted on figs .",
    "[ fig_cm ] and [ fig_jhhk1 ] providing a useful qualitative comparison .",
    "a distance modulus of 20.69 mag is assumed ( see section 8 for a detailed discussion of the distance ) .",
    "the isochrone which goes through the variable stars ( in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] ) is that for a population with an age of 2 gyr and a metallicity of z=0.0025 ( @xmath44\\sim-0.88 $ ] ) . for this model",
    "the trgb is at @xmath45 mag and @xmath46 .",
    "mag the other curve represents a population with an age of 10 gyr and the same metallicity ; its trgb is at @xmath47 mag and @xmath48 mag .",
    "these two curves bracket the giant branch observations and most of the stars are probably in this 2 to 10 gyr age range , as others have pointed out before ( e.g. gallart et al .",
    "2005 ; coleman & de jong 2008 ) .",
    "the failure of the models to come close to the observations of the dust enshrouded agb stars in fig .",
    "[ fig_jhhk1 ] is presumably the result of an incorrect choice of dust properties ( in particular the composition and/or particle size / shape etc . ) .",
    "the models offer alternative dust compositions , but none of them results in isochrones that fit all aspects of the observations .",
    "as we refine our understanding of the dust chemistry it will become easier to include the appropriate parameters in the models .",
    "we limit our discussion to those stars which are above the trgb as we have no systematic way of determining which of the lower luminosity objects are actually on the agb .",
    "the selection of variables , most of which will be agb stars , is described below .",
    "other probable agb members are selected with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 mag ( this last condition being to minimize the contribution from foreground dwarfs ) .",
    "these are the stars that are shown in black in figs .",
    "[ fig_cm ] and [ fig_jhhk1 ] .",
    "our selection criteria will certainly miss a few real agb stars , particularly those in the overlap parts of our fields where the photometry was not so good , and will probably contain a few foreground stars , but the contamination should be small .    ccrccrrccccccll     + & & & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath52 & 2mass & sp & other names + & & +    & & & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath52 & 2mass & sp & other names + & & +   +   +   +   +   +   + 2 & 38 & 12.8 & 34 & 34 & 56.6 & 29009 & 15.54 & 14.83 & 14.71 & 0.83 & 02381284 -

    "( 2008 ) models , discussed above , fit these agb stars much better than any models published previously .",
    "one of the major improvements is the use of proper molecular opacities as convective dredge up occurs , another is the incorporation of dust into the radiative transfer calculations for the agb , and several different prescriptions for the dust composition are allowed . for the illustrated isochrone",

    "the surface c / o - ratio will gradually increase , and the star will go from being o - rich ( spectral type m or s ) to c - rich ( spectral type c ) .",
    "stars with s - type spectra have c / o ratios less than , but very close to , one ( although see lebzelter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for an exception to this ) .",
    "if the initial metallicity of the star is low it will take very little dredge - up to bring c / o to more than one and this transition therefore tends to occur earlier in metal - weak populations .",
    "there is also a mass dependence , in that this so called  third dredge - up \" does not occur at all in low mass stars ( iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "the transition from o - rich to c - rich thus obviously depends on the mass and metallicity of the parent population .",
    "the luminosity at which this transition occurs is predicted by the models and it is therefore of interest to establish the maximum luminosity for the o - rich stars and the minimum for c - rich stars . within that context",
    "it is important to establish the luminosity range over which m , c and s stars are found .",
    "note that it is also possible to get extrinsic c or s stars , when enriched material is deposited onto the surface of another star to give that star the appearance of having undergone dredge - up before it actually does so .",
    "this is generally thought to be the explanation for low luminosity s and c stars .",
    "there are nine spectroscopically confirmed m stars in our sample with luminosities in the range @xmath58 mag , all with similar colours @xmath59 mag .",
    "there are also seven stars in our sample with s characteristics ( s , sc or ms spectral types ) .",
    "six of these are listed in table  [ agb ] , the seventh , dk54 , is fainter than the trgb and must therefore be assumed to be extrinsic , as dredge - up is not predicted to occur so low on the agb .",
    "the other six have @xmath60 and @xmath61 mag .",
    "none of these m or s stars has colours suggesting significant mass loss and their ranges in bolometric luminosity will be similar to their ranges in @xmath12 luminosity .",
    "the mix of spectral types and luminosities among the s stars , e.g. the faintest two are sc type and the brightest two are s type , suggests that these stars can not be from a single population , but must have a range of masses and/or metallicities",
    ". however , lebzelter et al . ( 2008 ) who do a detailed abundance analysis of agb stars in the intermediate age lmc cluster , ngc1846 , find a similar mixture of luminosity and c / o ratios for the o - rich stars in their study .",
    "in view of the fact that ngc1846 is not expected to have the large spread in ages that fornax does ( although it is probably not a single age population ) they suggest this is the result of some of the stars being in low luminosity phases following a shell flash and dredge - up",
    ". a similar explanation may contribute to the luminosity spread among the s stars in fornax .",

    "the fact that some of the 2mass points do not lie on the light curves is not in itself surprising .",
    "the periods are only good to between 5 and 10 percent so the phase information will not be perfect after a gap of over 1000 days ( 3 or 4 cycles ) .",
    "in addition , while the periods of most miras are very stable the light curves do not repeat exactly from one cycle to the next , and erratic changes and long term trends are a feature of c - rich miras with dust shells ( whitelock et al .",

    ". these could be manifestations of a long term trend , but it is impossible to be certain without many more observations .",
    "following whitelock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who discussed infrared photometry for galactic carbon stars , we consider miras to be stars with peak - to - peak amplitudes at @xmath72 in excess of 0.4 mag , and for which periods can be determined .",
    "it is on this basis that the stars in table  [ tab_lpv ] were divided into miras and semiregulars ( srs ) .",
    "the total , peak - to - peak variation of the stars described as ",
    "srs+trend \" is large , certainly @xmath73 mag , but the pulsation amplitude is relatively low .",
    "they are discussed further in section 7.1 .",
    "it seems likely that our survey for mira variables is complete for the area which we covered .",
    "the limiting magnitude on the @xmath11 reference frames is greater than 19 mag .",
    "an agb star in fornax with an extremely thick shell would probably have @xmath74 or redder . at the limiting @xmath11 magnitude",
    "this would correspond to @xmath75 mag , well above the @xmath12 limit of about 18 mag .",
    "no stars were found on any of the @xmath12 frames that did not have a counterpart on an @xmath11 frame , so it is unlikely that any extreme mira has been missed .",
    "furthermore , hinako fukushi cross identified objects we discuss here with those detected by akari ( with the irc camera in 4 bands between 3 and 11 @xmath76 m ) in 500 square arcmin of the area we survey .",
    "she found nothing beyond the sources detected by the irsf .",
    "it is , however , likely that there are some miras outside of the area that we survey .",
    "a search for 2mass sources with @xmath77 over an area with a radius of one degree centred on the fornax dsph reveals two sources outside our survey area : 024009463406256 and 023806183431194 . both of these have been observed by groenewegen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , their sources fornax15 and fornax31 , respectively , and both are carbon stars .",
    "these two are very likely to be miras and there could easily be one or two other miras in the same region with @xmath78 .",
    "the 2 gyr isochrone , which passes through most of the variable stars in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] , is probably reasonably representative of the bulk of the fornax agb population .",
    "however , the fact that this isochrone passes close to most of the red variables should not be taken to indicate that all the stars in this plot were formed at the same time .",
    "indeed , given the range of ages and metallicities that are known in fornax , it would be extraordinary if all the large amplitude variables were from the same population . in the case of oxygen - rich miras",
    "it is known that the pulsation period is a function of mass , as well as , at the shorter periods , of metallicity ( feast & whitelock 2000 ) .",
    "one would reasonably expect the carbon miras to follow parallel trends and the available evidence is consistent with this . thus the three magellanic cloud clusters discussed by nishida et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have ages of about 1.6 gyr ( mucciarelli et al .",
    "2007a , b ; glatt et al .",
    "2008 ) and their three carbon miras have a mean period of 490 days , whilst van loon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that the cluster kmhk 1603 has an age of 0.9 - 1.0 gyr and contains a carbon mira of period 680 days .",
    "the kinematics of galactic carbon miras ( feast et al .",
    "2006 ) is also consistent with a decreasing age with increasing period .",
    "so far as the isochrones are concerned it is worth noting that the sequence of stars in fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] is not a sequence of increasing period with colour such as might be expected if the miras were evolving with period along a single evolutionary track ( which would be essentially identical to an isochrone for agb stars which evolve very rapidly ) .",
    "furthermore a comparison of the bolometric luminosities of the fornax miras with the models in diagrams such as the @xmath79 plot of marigo et al .",
    "( their fig .",
    "1 ) shows that whilst the fainter , shorter period , stars must be amongst the oldest ( lowest initial mass ) carbon stars allowed by these models , the age of the brighter , longer period carbon miras can not be estimated in this way since it depends on @xmath80 which is known very imprecisely if at all .",
    "the pulsation periods that the marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) models associate with the agb variables bear no relation to the values actually found here .",
    "however , stars at this stage evolve rapidly and the isochrones provided by the on - line model go from @xmath81 ( p=162 ) to @xmath82 ( p=257 ) in a single step , so it is nt practical to match them with the detailed observations .",
    "in theory one might expect the pulsation period of a mira to change as the star evolves and loses mass . in practice",
    "the observational evidence , discussed in the previous paragraph , suggests that the period of a mira depends on its initial mass and does not change significantly with time .",
    "this is primarily because a star only becomes a mira briefly ( lifetimes are around @xmath83 yr ) at the end of its agb evolution .",
    "it remains possible that the mira will evolve very rapidly through longer periods before completely leaving the agb , but that has not been established .",
    "the pulsation periods for the miras in fornax , and a comparison with magellanic cloud clusters mentioned above , suggest ages of a few gyr for most of them .",
    "the short period ones are probably somewhat older and it is possible that the 215 day mira , f5010 , could be significantly older , around 10 gyr ( it is the bluest of the miras in fig .  [ fig_cm ] ) , but then it would not be expected to be a carbon star . for stars as blue as this one , @xmath84 , the colours do not allow us to distinguish between o- and c - rich stars , so spectral classification for f5010 would be particularly interesting .    in the following discussion the magnitudes and colours of the fornax variables are transformed to the saao system to allow a comparison with data for the galaxy and the lmc , and also to apply the colour dependent bolometric corrections ( whitelock et al .",
