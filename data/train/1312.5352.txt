    "in photosynthesis light absorption and charge separation take place in specialised multi - chromophoric systems .",
    "while the reaction centre ( rc ) complexes , where the primary charge separation occurs , are very similar in different photosynthetic systems , the light - harvesting antennas show a wide variety @xcite . clearly , it is possible to optimise absorption of light and make excitation transport to rc efficient in many different ways .",
    "one of the strategies used in most of the photosynthetic systems is to organise the pigments energetically in an energy funnel with the rc in the bottom of the sink @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pigment molecules are usually close enough to enable sufficient resonant interaction and thereby fast excitation transport .",
    "such general optimisation strategies are widely reported and well understood in photosynthetic antenna systems .    a result of the relatively dense packing of the pigment molecules in the antenna complexes is the emergence of delocalised frenkel exciton states  @xcite .",
    "the later has led to recognition of the role of memory effects and coherence in frenkel exciton dynamics in photosynthetic light - harvesting .",
    "the discussion was recently revitalised by novel coherent multidimensional spectroscopy measurements revealing long - lived oscillatory features in a so called fenna - mathews - olson ( fmo ) light - harvesting antenna complex @xcite .",
    "the oscillations were interpreted as electronic coherences and their long lifetime was taken as an evidence for possible coherent excitation transport .",
    "it was argued that parallel coherent excitation transport pathways may enable interference - based quantum optimisation possibilities for making excitation transfer through the fmo complexes more efficient .",
    "analogous observations were also reported for light - harvesting complexes in photosynthetic marine algae @xcite .",
    "this initiated numerous new theoretical investigations of the role of coherence in excitation energy transport @xcite . an important conclusion drawn from these efforts concerned the optimal parameter region of the transport",
    "- it was realized that the most efficient transport takes place in the intermediate regime between fully coherent and incoherent transport where the inter - pigment resonance interaction and the system - bath interaction are not so different @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the efficiency curve has a rather flat maximum meaning that optimal transport can be achieved by quite a broad set of parameters .",
    "in contrast to the large number of simulations following the excitation dynamics @xcite , much fewer studies have made the effort to calculate the coherent multidimensional spectroscopy signals , which would directly correspond to what is observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "it turned out that reproducing the long - lived oscillations in calculated 2d spectra as electronic coherences is not straightforward .",
    "even studies based on hierarchy equations of motion ( heom ) where bath memory effects are included formally exact could not reach agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "additional assumptions had to be made .",
    "for example , assuming correlated static and dynamic disorder at different pigment sites led to long - lived electronic coherences @xcite .",
    "however , neither correlated nuclear motions nor inhomogeneous broadening has any independent support . quite the opposite .",
    "thorough molecular dynamics studies did not show any evidence for such correlations @xcite . a recent study using heom approach produced long - lasting electronic coherences @xcite .",
    "the authors used a spectral density , which fitted well the fluorescence line narrowing experiments @xcite for frequencies above 50 @xmath0 .",
    "however , the low - frequency region , which is particularly important for electronic dephasing and is most sensitive to temperature , had an unrealistically small amplitude .",
    "initially , the possible vibrational origin of the oscillatory features in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) signal in fmo was discarded since the nuclear modes in the frequency region of observed oscillations ( @xmath1150 @xmath0 ) are very weakly coupled to the electronic transition leading to a negligible huang - rhys factor @xmath2 . in the 180 @xmath0 region there are a few modes with the total @xmath2 reaching almost 0.05 @xcite , but even this is too weak to produce significant oscillatory features in 2d signals .",
    "transition energies of the bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) molecules in fmo are quite well established @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the 0 - 1 vibronic transition energy of the 180 @xmath0 mode region on the red - most bchl is almost in resonance with the 0 - 0 transition energy of one of its neighbours .",
    "consequences of such resonance for natural light - harvesting have not been fully analysed before . a vibronic exciton model where one mode per pigment is treated explicitly @xcite was applied for calculating electronic 2d response functions of fmo @xcite .",
    "it was shown that owing to the resonance , the weak transition of mainly vibronic origin at the lowest energy bchl obtains a significant additional oscillator strength due to mixing with the strong purely electronic transition at the neighbouring molecule .",
    "furthermore , the long - lived oscillations observed in 2d experiments were explained by the fact that energy fluctuations of the vibrational levels of a molecule are correlated and consequently the corresponding coherences between vibronic levels have a long lifetime .",
    "the intensity borrowing is quite robust and moving to some extent out from the resonance due to the inhomogeneous broadening does not influence the results appreciably .",
    "an analogous resonance between 0 - 0 and 0 - 1 transitions of neighbouring pigments was recently used in an excitonic dimer model where adiabatic potential energy surfaces were calculated @xcite .",
    "the authors argue that because of the near resonance between the levels , the adiabatic approximation breaks down and non - adiabatic coupling has to be taken into account .",
    "the non - adiabatic coupling causes mixing of the states leading to intensity redistribution very much like in ref .",
    "excitation dynamics due to the non - adiabatic coupling in the context of light - harvesting complexes has been analysed in terms of curve - crossing and surface hopping @xcite .",
    "schrter and khn studied the interplay between non - adiabatic dynamics and frenkel exciton transfer in aggregates where both s@xmath3 and s@xmath4 transitions were considered @xcite .",
    "also excitation annihilation has been described as non - adiabatic coupling between one- and two - exciton manifolds @xcite .",
    "tiwari et al .",
    "@xcite investigated a different situation where the potentials are nested and the crossing points are very far from the equilibrium resembling the situation in internal conversion . using 2d signal calculations the authors argue that the long - lived oscillating features of 2d spectroscopy of light - harvesting systems could be explained in terms of ground state coherent nuclear motions excited via enhanced transitions with strong vibronic character .",
    "several other studies have recently addressed the issue how to separate the electronic and vibrational quantum beats in electronic 2d spectroscopy .",
    "comparison of the oscillatory patterns and oscillation phases in two representative systems , displaced oscillator and excitonic dimer , was reported @xcite .",
    "the model was further developed for a dimer with ground state vibrational levels included @xcite .",
    "the ground and excited state vibrational coherences were thoroughly compared in vibronic exciton dimer model @xcite .",
    "oscillatory phonon features in colloidal quantum dots were modelled @xcite and it was shown that following separately positive and negative frequency components of the population time fourier transform gives additional control over the liouville pathways thereby enabling a more clear distinction between electronic and vibrational beatings @xcite .",
    "we point out that the method used by christensson et al .",
    "@xcite , a so called one particle approximation ( opa ) , only includes excited state vibrations . in order to account for the ground state vibrational states",
    ", at least the two particle approximation ( tpa ) @xcite has to be employed .",
    "tpa is exact in case of a dimer and has been used for analyses of 2d spectra @xcite .",
    "various analogous approaches have been applied for modelling a vibronic dimer @xcite .",
    "an obvious question arrises - what effects does one miss by using simple opa calculations as in @xcite compared to the exact solution of the problem . here",
    "we address the issue by carrying out a comparison of opa and tpa using a model dimer resembling two neighbouring low - energy bchl molecules in the fmo .",
    "the numerically exact reference is provided by the multi - configuration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method @xcite .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    "we start from presenting the basics of the the vibronic exciton model and the opa as well as mctdh approaches .",
    "the theory is followed by comprehensive model calculations of a vibronic heterodimer for various parameter sets .",
    "we show that despite of the dominantly monomeric character of the heterodimer , the intensities of the vibrational features in the fluorescence spectrum are significantly affected .",
    "this has consequences for how to use the fluorescence line narrowing spectroscopy to experimentally determine the spectral densities @xcite . in the final part",
    "the results are discussed and conclusions formulated .",
    "in the following we will use the frenkel exciton hamiltonian describing coupled electronic ( zero , @xmath5 , and one - exciton , @xmath6 , space ) and nuclear degrees of freedom , @xmath7 , @xcite @xmath8 |m\\rangle \\langle n| \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] denoting the monomeric electronic states by @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the ground and excited states , one has @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "the same approximation is made for the linear coupling constant , @xmath18 , which relates to the huang - rhys factor as @xmath19 .",
    "absorption and emission spectra will be calculated in condon - approximation for the monomeric transition dipole matrix elements @xmath20 , summed to give the aggregate dipole operator according to @xmath21      the problem of coupled exciton - vibrational dynamics can be approached by a @xmath22-particle approximation scheme @xcite . to this end",
    "we introduce vibrational states for the different potential energy surfaces according to @xmath23 where it is understood that @xmath24 could be a multi - index in cases where several vibrational modes per monomer need to be taken into account .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath25 of @xmath26 can be expanded as @xmath27 with the one - particle states @xmath28 and the two - particle states @xmath29 in principle eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) will contain further terms , but for the present case of a molecular heterodimer , the two - particle ansatz is already exact .",
    "the restriction to the first term is the so - called opa .    using the eigenstates , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , the absorption spectrum will be calculated in the zero temperature limit as ( @xmath30 normalisation constant ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a parameter mimicking the finite line width ( dephasing time ) of the real system , @xmath33 denotes the eigenstates of @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the overal ground state ( see below ) , and @xmath36 is the transition frequency . the emission spectrum is calculated as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the boltzmann population of an one - exciton - vibrational state with energy @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a normalisation constant .      in principle the @xmath22-particle approach provides a systematic route to the exact eigenstates of the one - exciton hamiltonian .",
    "however , with increasing aggregate size and number of vibrational coordinates one will soon face the dimensionality bottleneck and the problem will become numerically intractable .",
    "an efficient alternative approach is the mctdh method , which rests on the expansion of the time - dependent state vector into a basis of time - dependent hartree products that are composed of single particle functions ( spfs ) @xcite .",
    "applications to exciton dynamics and spectroscopy have been given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , the state vector is expanded in terms of the one - exciton basis , i.e @xmath41 in a next step the nuclear wave function is written in mctdh form as follows @xmath42 here , the @xmath43 are the time - dependent expansion coefficients weighting the contributions of the different hartree products , which are composed of spfs , @xmath44 , for the @xmath45th nuclear degree of freedom in state @xmath46 .",
    "overall there are @xmath47 nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "although it is in principle possible to obtain eigenstates with the mctdh method , being a time - dependent approach , it is more suited to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation . therefore we will use it to calculate the absorption spectrum according to the time - dependent reformulation of eq .",

    "all wave packet propagation simulations have been performed using the heidelberg program package @xcite .",
    "the mctdh dimer setup , which has been applied here , includes three electronic states ( one ground state and two singly excited states ) . since the ground state has been used for the preparation of the initial wave packet only , one spf per mode has been sufficient to describe it properly .",
    "the actual propagation of the wave packet takes place on the two excited states ; here four spfs were necessary to obtain converged results . as a primitive basis",
    "we have used a harmonic oscillator ( 20 points ) discrete variable representation within an interval of [ -3.5:3.5 ] for all modes . for all calculations",
    "the multi - set method was used .",
    "in the following application the case of two sites ( vibronic heterodimer , @xmath54 ) will be considered .",

    "a number of studies have proposed electronic hamiltonian of the complex , based on modelling of a set of spectroscopic observables . for a review see @xcite .",
    "there is a general agreement that the bchl 3 and 4 have the lowest site energies .",
    "the transition energy difference is proposed to be from about 110 to 180 .",
    "excitonic coupling between these two molecules is negative with values from about -50 to -75 @xcite .",
