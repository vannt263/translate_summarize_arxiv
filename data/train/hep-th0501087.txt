    "the renormalization group ( rg ) theory is suitable to the study of many modern physical problems .",
    "generically , every situation where the scale of typical physical interest belongs to a ( wide ) range of correlated or coupled scales may be ( must be ? ) treated by rg techniques .",
    "critical phenomena , which are characterized by one ( or several ) diverging correlation length(s ) , provide the  didactic example @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory , with its strongly correlated quantum fluctuations , is not less famous since it has given rise to the early stages of the rg theory @xcite .",
    "thanks to a fortunate success ( essentially due to an impressive diagrammatic calculation @xcite ) in estimating the critical behavior of some systems @xcite , the perturbative framework has pushed into the background the undoubtedly nonperturbative character 2839,32,5865 of the rg theory . as a consequence ,",
    "there has been relatively little interest in the development of nonperturbative rg techniques 4595 .",
    "in particular the formulation of the rg theory via an infinitesimal change of the scale of reference ( running scale ) , designated by the generic expression exact renormalization group equation@xcite  although known since 1971 @xcite , has actually been actively considered only since the beginning of the nineties @xcite . because the variety of systems to which the exact rg formulation could be applied is large @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and also because the perturbative framework is generally not well adapted to such studies 5865,5744,5745 , it is worthwhile making every endeavour to master , if possible , the exact rg framework .",
    "the exact rg equation is an integro - differential equation the study of which calls for approximations and/or truncations . among the possible approximations , those based on expansions in powers of a small parameter such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 ( where the upper - dimension @xmath9 for the @xmath0-vector model ) are perturbative in essence .",
    "they , however , present the advantage of allowing analytic calculations but are attached to the smallness of quantities that are actually not small in the cases of physical interest . in some cases the perturbative framework may fail @xcite .",
    "the derivative expansion @xcite , of present interest here , is an expansion in powers of the derivative of the field .",
    "it is not associated to a small parameter though it is expected to be rather adapted to the study of phenomena at small momenta ( large distances ) like critical phenomena for instance .",
    "the interest of the derivative expansion is that the physical parameters ( like @xmath10 and @xmath0 ) may take on arbitrary values .",
    "hence , in the range of validity of the expansion ( thus presumed to be in the large distance regime ) , the approach is actually nonperturbative .",
    "the drawback is the necessary recourse to numerical techniques [ for studying coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ode ) ] that are not always well controlled .",
    "consequently very few orders of the derivative expansion have really been explicitly considered .",
    "many studies have been effectuated in the local potential approximation ( lpa ) , i.e. at the leading order [ @xmath11 of the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "also , estimates of the critical exponents for ising - like models ( @xmath12 ) have been obtained several times from full studies of the next - to - leading order ( which is exactly equal to zero at order @xmath13 ) , the order @xmath14 has not been completely considered because the evolution equation of the wave function renormalization has been neglected . in reference",
    "@xcite , @xmath15 systems are incompletely studied up to @xmath16 because one differential equation has been discarded . also , the study of reference @xcite at order @xmath17 though interesting , is incomplete since only three differential equations , among five constituting actually the order @xmath18 , have been treated . ]",
    "[ i.e. @xmath16 ] @xcite , and even from a full study of the third order [ @xmath20 @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", only two full studies have been effectuated up to @xmath16 for the @xmath1 vector model 3828,4754 . yet",
    ", this model provides us with the opportunity of varying @xmath0  and of comparing the results with the best estimates of critical exponents obtained from six @xcite or  seven @xcite orders of the perturbative framework in a wide range of values of @xmath0 .",
    "interesting informations on the possible convergence of the derivative expansion are then reachable .    in the present study ,",
    "i consider the @xmath1 wilson - polchinski exact rg equation expanded up to order @xmath16 in the derivative expansion and i calculate the critical exponents . beyond the specific calculation ( which was lacking )",
    "the real aim is to try to clarify ( and also to evaluate ) the present status of the derivative expansion .",
    "still , i must explain why i consider the wilson - polchinski equation .    indeed ,",
    "there are several different approaches and treatments of the exact rg equation so that it is not easy to really estimate the validity of the choice of the equation or / and of the calculations available in the litterature .",
    "let me try to briefly summarize the situation and to justify my choice .",
    "there are two families of exact rg equations ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the first family expresses the rg flow ( @xmath21 ) of the microscopic action @xmath22 $ ] ( hamiltonian ) associated to a running momentum scale @xmath23 which , in the circumstances , is a running ultra - violet cutoff .",
    "the second family expresses the rg flow of @xmath24 $ ] , the legendre transform of @xmath25 $ ] , in that case the running scale @xmath23 effectively appears as an infra - red momentum cutoff .",
    "there is no fundamental difference between the two families since the object of the rg is the same in the two cases : accounting for all the correlated scales @xmath26 ranging from 0 to @xmath27 ( at criticality ) ; only the physical meaning of the field variable at hand has been changed : @xmath28 is related to a microscopic description ( like a spin of the ising model ) while @xmath29 is thought of as a macroscopic variable ( like the magnetization ) .",
    "if one wants to calculate an equation of state or some correlation functions or some universal critical amplitude ratios , the second family of equations is better adapted .",
    "but if one only wants to estimate critical exponents ( for example to illustrate the convergence of the derivative expansion ) , then considering the first family is surely more efficient .",
    "actually , the set of ode generated in the derivative expansion is much simpler when considered with the first family than with the second .",
    ", the consideration of an exact rg equation of the second family yields a set of ode the writing of which requires 20 pages @xcite while , even at order @xmath30 , the first family yields a set of equations that holds on a half of page progress .",
    "the complexity of dealing with the second family is also well illustrated in the appendix of reference @xcite . ]",
    "the first family is indeed better adapted to the calculation of critical exponents for the same reason as in the field theoretical approach to critical phenomena @xcite , the critical exponents are defined from renormalization functions that are introduced within the microscopic action @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the wilson 440 and polchinski @xcite exact rg equations belong to the first family , they only differ by the way the smooth cutoff function has been defined ( a specific function for wilson , an arbitrary one for polchinski ) .",
    "of course , the two equations are physically equivalent , but due to a misunderstanding in the introduction of the critical exponent @xmath31 in the exact rg equation as formulated by polchinski , it is only recently that the equivalence has been clearly established @xcite .",
    "if the coupled set of ode generated by the derivative expansion is different in the two families of exact rg equations , the treatments of the differential equations encountered in the litterature differ also . for convenience ,",
    "let me classify the studies in two groups according to whether the authors have adopted the conventional approach ( defined below ) or not .",
    "the conventional approach is characterized as follows :    1 .",
    "the set of ode is numerically studied as such ( e.g. , without considering any artefact such as an expansion in powers of the field ) .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath31 is introduced in a conventional way as defined in references @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents are estimated from a set of eigenvalue equations linearized about a fixed point solution of the flow equation .",
    "the reparametrization invariance is explicitly accounted for .",
    "to limit myself to the studies mentioned above that consider @xmath32 systems via equations of the second family developped up to @xmath33 3828,4754 : the study of reference @xcite follows the conventional approach while that of reference @xcite does not .",
    "in fact , in this latter work , except the first point above , none of the other points is satisfied .",
    "this is particularly important relatively to point ( iv ) because the reparametrization invariance induces a line of equivalent fixed points along with @xmath31 is constant @xcite . in the case",
    "where the invariance is broken ( it is generally the case within the derivative expansion , except in reference @xcite ) then the fixed points along the line are no longer equivalents and the effective @xmath31 ( when introduced conventionally ) varies with the global normalisation of the field @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , even if the invariance is broken , one expects that a vestige of this invariance can still be observed @xcite via an extremum of @xmath31 on varying the global normalization of the field @xmath34 .",
    "the absence of explicit consideration of the reparametrization invariance in reference @xcite is intringuing inasmuch as the estimation of the critical exponents is excellent ( see section [ comp ] ) .    by considering the wilson - polchinski rg equation for @xmath35 systems ,",
    "my first aim is to illustrate the conventional treatment as described above .",
    "additionnal aims follow :    1 .   morris and turner @xcite  have imposed the reparametrization invariance by choosing a specific cutoff function and the resulting estimates of the critical exponents are not very good , especially for @xmath36 . does the wilson - polchinski rg equation also produce such bad results at order @xmath37 ? .",
    "2 .   is the wilson - polchinski rg equation able to produce estimates of critical exponents comparable to those obtained by gersdorff and wetterich @xcite ?",
    "the @xmath1 exact rg equation expanded up to order @xmath14 involves three coupled ode .",
    "compared to the ising case @xmath38 , it is somewhat an intermediate state between the order @xmath14 which involves two coupled equations and the order @xmath18 which involves five coupled equations @xcite .",
    "4 .   does one observe some signs of convergence of the derivative expansion already at order @xmath39 ?",
    "relative to this latter point , it is worth mentioning here the work of litim @xcite whose aim , though very interesting , differs from that of the present work .",
    "litim focuses its attention almost exclusively on the second family of the exact rg equations and especially on the arbitrariness introduced by the regularization process ( cut - off procedure ) but he does not account for the reparametrization invariance . from general arguments ( independent from the derivative expansion ) , he provides us with a criterium for choosing the regulator which should optimize the convergence of the derivative expansion already at a very low order .",
    "the considerations are surely useful especially for studying sophisticated systems , such as gauge field theory for example , for which already the leading order of the derivative expansion is difficult to implement .",
    "however , litim has not actually studied the convergence properties of the derivative expansion in itself but , in fact , has implicitly assumed that it converges ( at least , the fact that the expansion could yield only asymptotic series has been excluded ) .",
    "furthermore , litim s criterium of choice does not apply to the wilson - polchinski rg equation .",
    "in particular , at leading order of the derivative expansion , his optimization provides the same estimates of critical exponents as those obtained with the wilson - polchinski rg equation ( see section [ numres ] ) which , at this order , does not display any dependence on the regularization process .",
    "according to reference @xcite , after subtraction of the high temperature fixed point @xmath41 from the action , the wilson - polchinski exact rg equation satisfied by an @xmath42-symmetric action @xmath43 $ ] ( with @xmath44 ) reads as follows : @xmath45 \\right\\ }   \\label{eq : wilpol00}\\end{aligned}\\]]in which @xmath46 stands for @xmath47 ( hence @xmath48 @xmath49 in which @xmath50 is some initial momentum scale of reference @xcite ) , @xmath51 is a dimensionless @xmath10-vector ( @xmath10 is the dimension of the euclidean space and @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 , @xmath54 is a dimensionless cutoff function that decreases rapidly when @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 is an arbitrary function ( except the normalization @xmath58 ) introduced to test the reparametrization invariance , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath61 : @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "then , the resulting value of @xmath31 nececessarily coincides with @xmath99 as defined by equation ( [ eq : etaopt ] ) and the resulting value of @xmath118 gives @xmath119 . though the number of differential equations has increased twofold this procedure of determining the optimized fixed point is the most efficient one when parameters ( like @xmath0 and some other ones , see following section ) have to be varied .      in order to perform an actual numerical study of the set of second order ode described in the preceding section ,",
    "i make the following choice : ( named @xmath120 ) , however the equations were invariant in the change @xmath121 so that one of the two parameters was unnecessary . ] @xmath122    following the terminology of reference @xcite , the free parameter @xmath123 is redundant and is intended to be used to optimize the numerical results of the derivative expansion .",
    "the introduction of @xmath123 is linked to the general property of reparametrization invariance which is broken by the present derivative expansion .",
    "the normalization @xmath124 is chosen in order to distinguish the effect of simply changing the global normalization of the field which induces a line of equivalent fixed points ( at fixed @xmath123 ) .",
    "that line is customarily associated to the arbitrariness of @xmath96 the value of @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) , i.e. the coefficient of the kinetic term in @xmath43 $ ] ( see preceding section ) .",
    "changing the value of @xmath123 in the complete theory would induce new ( equivalent ) lines of equivalent fixed points .",
    "though they are part of the same invariance , the two free parameters @xmath123 and @xmath96 have effects of different nature in the derivative expansion . as a global constant of normalization",
    ", one can expect that , at a given order of the derivative expansion , the variation of @xmath96 will still reveal a vestige of the invariance of the exact theory ( see preceding section ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the effect of @xmath123 spreads out over different orders of the derivative expansion .",
    "consequently , one expects to observe a progressive restoration of the redundant character of @xmath123 as the order of the expansion increases . regarding the extremely low order  considered here ( @xmath127 ) , one must not expect too much from varying @xmath123 ( see section [ numres ] ) .",
    "notice that the cutoff function @xmath128 is essentially a regulator of the integrals ( [ eq : integ ] ) generated by the derivative expansion .",
    "besides the arbitrary choice in the decreasing at large @xmath129 , the other sources of arbitrariness of the cutoff function may be included within the arbitrary function @xmath130 .",
    "this is why the choice ( [ eq : p ] ) does not involve any free parameter .",
    "there are two different methods for numerically studying systems of coupled nonlinear ode as those described above : the shooting and the relaxation methods ( see , for example reference @xcite ) .",
    "because it is the easiest to implement , only the shooting method is considered here ( though it is less numerically stable than the relaxation method ) .",
    "considering an initial point @xmath131 where known conditions ( initial conditions ) are imposed and trial values are given to the remaining integration constants , one integrates the ode system up to a second point @xmath132 where the required conditions are checked . using a newton - raphson algorithm ,",
    "one iterates the test until the latter conditions are satisfied within a given accuracy .    in the present study ,",
    "the two points @xmath131 and @xmath133 are either the origin @xmath83 and a large value @xmath134 ( shooting from the origin ) or the reverse ( shooting to the origin ) .    in principle , shooting to the origin is technically better adapted to the present study . for example , in the case of the fixed point equations ( eq:3eqspf1[eq:3eqspf3 ] ) with @xmath31 fixed , one starts from @xmath135 with trial values for the three constants @xmath136 and the initial values of the three functions and of their first derivatives @xmath137 defined by ( [ eq : v1asy][eq : v3asy ] ) .",
    "after integration up to the origin , one checks whether the three conditions ( [ eq : oricond1]eq : oricond3 ) are fulfilled or not . the system is balanced and the values of the other interesting parameters are simply by - products of the adjustment .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath96 associated to the arbitrarily fixed value of @xmath31 is simply read as the value that @xmath138 takes on after achievement of the adjustment .",
    "if one wants instead to determine @xmath98 , then @xmath31 has to be considered as a trial parameter like @xmath94 and the supplementary condition ( [ eq : z0 ] ) with @xmath96 an arbitrary fixed number , must be fulfilled at the origin .",
    "unfortunately , equations ( [ eq:3eqspf1][eq:3eqspf3 ] ) are singular at @xmath83 so that it is impossible to shoot to the origin . in reference",
    "@xcite ( where the leading order lpa was studied for small values of @xmath0 ) , the difficulty was circumvented by shooting to a point close to the origin . on the contrary ,",
    "i have chosen to shoot from the origin because it is easy to control the equations starting from that point .",
    "starting from the origin implies that , for a given value of @xmath31 , the adjustable parameters no longer are the @xmath94 but the initial values @xmath139 , the initial values of the first derivatives follow from ( [ eq : oricond1]eq : oricond3 ) . at the point @xmath134",
    "only three conditions are needed in order to balance the number of adjustable parameters .",
    "thus one must eliminate the @xmath94 from the six equations ( eq : v1asy[eq : v3asy ] ) to obtain three anonymous conditions .",
    "consequently the precise knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of the regular fixed point solution is not necessary .",
    "it appears that imposing conditions like @xmath140 is sufficient to determine the solution of interest .",
    "i first adjust the trial parameters so as to reach some not too large a value of @xmath135 , then i increase @xmath134 until the desired accuracy is reached on the trial parameters .",

    "hence , for the numerical results i have obtained at order lpa for @xmath311 , @xmath312 and other subleading critical exponents @xmath314 , the reader is referred to table 1 of reference @xcite .    at order @xmath14",
    ", once the arbitrariness of @xmath315 has been removed via the definition of @xmath99 , the values of the critical exponents still depend on @xmath123 in such a way that , for a given value of @xmath0 , it is impossible to define preferred  values .",
    "for example @xmath313 ( from now on , @xmath313 stands for @xmath99 ) depends on @xmath123 almost linearly .",
    "due to the spreading out over several orders of the effects of @xmath123 , the study of the convergence of the derivative expansion relies rather on the consideration of several orders .",
    "now the order @xmath316 is still too low to allow an appreciation of the convergence of the derivative expansion . instead of presently producing one best  estimate for each critical exponent at a given value of @xmath0 , it is preferable to maintain the freedom of @xmath123 in order to better emphasize the early beginnings of some criteria of convergence if any ( see section [ comp ] ) .",

    "i had proposed a criterium of choice of the value of @xmath319 which gave a preferred value of @xmath31 .",
    "it was based on the idea of golner @xcite of a global minimization of the magnitude of the function @xmath320 ( i.e. , @xmath321 ) .",

    ", the order @xmath37 has increased the potential number of subcritical exponents ( due to the supplementary terms in the truncated action considered ) .",

    "but at order @xmath37 , new terms involving two derivatives contribute to @xmath328 $ ] , and a term proportionnal to @xmath332 induces a priori an in - between correction exponent . despite important differences between the classical dimensions of the couples @xmath327 and @xmath332 , table [ tab3 ] clearly shows that , for @xmath12 , the order @xmath39 induces a splitting of the lpa values of the subcritical exponents @xmath314 for @xmath333 ( @xmath312 is , in the perturbative approach , associated to the unique @xmath334 coupling and is not , fortunately for the perturbative framework , subject to this splitting ) .",
    "this simple splitting is presumably not preserved for other values of @xmath0 due to the supplementary contribution of @xmath335 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the evolution of @xmath313 with @xmath0 from different works .",
    "the results obtained from the resummation of six @xcite and seven @xcite orders of the perturbation field theory serves the purpose of standards ( other accurate estimates of the critical exponents , especially for @xmath336 , exist in the litterature , for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "one sees that the present study yields generally small values of @xmath313 compared to the standards except for small @xmath0 and for the highest values of @xmath123 . the evolution of @xmath313 with @xmath0 is smoother than in the work of morris and turner @xcite but , as in this latter work , the non - monotonic behavior of the standards ( responsible for the maximum of @xmath313 about @xmath337 or @xmath338 ) is not reproduced . instead , the results of gersdorff and wetterich @xcite are better .",
    "the present results are however not so bad if one keeps in mind that the first estimate of @xmath313 in the derivative expansion is given at order @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , figure [ fig1 ] shows also recent estimates from the resummation of three orders of the perturbative series using an efficient method @xcite .",
    "one sees that the present estimates withstand the comparison ( except the monotonic evolution with @xmath0 ) .",
    "notice also , for @xmath0 fixed , the monotonic evolution of @xmath313 with @xmath123 already mentioned .",
    "the results for the critical exponent @xmath311 are more interesting to discuss because the order @xmath39 provides its second estimate .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the evolution with @xmath0 of @xmath311 at order @xmath39 compared to the results at order lpa ( obtained in the present work ) , the standards @xcite are reproduced also .",
    "again , one observes that the results for large @xmath0 are not as good as for small values .",
    "however , for these latter values , one clearly sees that there is a range of values of @xmath123 where the two estimates at orders lpa and @xmath39 flank the standards and another range where the two present estimates are on the same side ( with respect to the standards ) .",
    "this is a phenomenon often observed in convergent series the elements of which depend on a free parameter ( like @xmath123 ) but the resumed series does not : on varying the free parameter , one may observe monotonic or alternate approaches to the limit .",
    "these features may be used to determine error bars .",
    "presently one additionnal order would be necessary to propose such error bars .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows also that , when @xmath0 increases the dependence of @xmath311 on @xmath123 becomes non - monotonic .",
    "this is interesting since such extrema may indicate a vestige of the primarily independence on @xmath123 of the exact rg equation .",
    "why this effect does not occur at small values of @xmath0 is not explained .",
    "once more , at least one supplementary order of the derivative expansion would be necessary to understand this point .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the results for @xmath311 coming from @xcite and @xcite compared to the present results for @xmath318 and the standards @xcite .",
    "one observes that the present results are globally better than in @xcite and that again the estimates of gersdorff and wetterich @xcite are excellent ( for small @xmath0 the points almost coincide with the standards ) .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the present results for @xmath312 at order lpa and @xmath39 compared to the standards @xcite .",
    "this figure is the matching piece to figure [ fig2 ] and the same kinds of remarks stand : monotonic and alternate approaches to the standards at fixed @xmath0 exist as well as non - monotonic dependences on @xmath123 .",
    "the magnitude of these effects are larger than for @xmath311 and the accuracy is worse , but this is expected for a subleading eigenvalue : the accuracy decreases as the order of the eigenvalue increases .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the results for @xmath312 coming from @xcite compared to the present results for @xmath318 and the standards @xcite .",
    "one observes that the present results are much better than in @xcite .",
    "one may regret that gersdorff and wetterich @xcite , who obtained excellent values for @xmath311 and @xmath313 , had not estimated @xmath312 .",
    "as already said , this study @xcite does not follow the conventional approach defined in the introduction .",
    "in particular nothing is said on the way the reparametrization invariance is accounted for . in fact , instead of leaving free the value of @xmath339 to get a function @xmath340 , the procedure followed in @xcite was to attach the determination of @xmath313 to the minimum of the potential .",
    "this condition fixes @xmath315 and the arbitrariness carried by the reparametrization invariance is implicitly removed this way . because morris and turner @xcite have considered an equation of the same family and have obtained disappointing results , i think that this particular way of choosing @xmath317 could be the main reason for the excellent estimates of the critical exponents obtained in @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to adapt it to the study of the wilson - polchinski rg equation .    to conclude , the derivative expansion at order @xmath33 already displays a tendency to converge .",
    "this must be confirmed by considering the next order which is in progress @xcite .",
    "the study of reference @xcite which for @xmath12 follows the procedure of reference @xcite and the optimization process of reference @xcite is very encouraging .",
