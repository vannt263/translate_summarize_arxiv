    "the absence of the 2.089 @xmath0 m feii line in the mn 112 @xmath1-band spectrum is consistent with a higher temperature in this line emitting region .",

    "clearly the @xmath1-band spectra for these three stars - mn 96 , mn 112 , and mn 76 - are nearly identical ( barring small differences in line widths and strengths ) , and should render the same ir spectral classification .",
    "these stars could be transitional between the lbv and late - wn stars , or have spectral types varying between minimum contraction to maximum expansion , corresponding to hot and cool temperature phases , respectively .",

    "( 2011 ) though no spectrum was shown .",
    "mn 42 resembles those clbvs shown in the left panel , lacking feii emission , strengthening the case that the feii - deficient clbvs may be transitioning to late - wn stars .",
