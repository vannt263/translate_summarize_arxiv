    "interestingly , this system exhibits a sequence of five magnetic phase transitions featuring temperature dependent incommensurate antiferromagnetic phases with commensurate lock - ins and a ferromagnetic ground state , where all magnetic structures are collinear along the _ a _ axis.@xcite the ferromagnetic structure reveals two strongly different magnetic moments for the cross - tie co ions ( 4a site ) and spine co ions ( 8e site ) of 1.54 @xmath8 and 2.73 @xmath8,@xcite respectively , despite the fact that both co@xmath13 ions apparently present high - spin configurations as macroscopic measurements exhibit saturation of the cross - tie moments.@xcite in the kagome staircase structure several nearest and next - nearest neighbor exchange interaction pathways are possible,@xcite which is the motivation for this study .",
    "investigating the magnetization density , which is reflected by the respective magnetic form factors of the ions , may reveal preferred exchange pathways with the presence of magnetization on the involved o sites .",
    "eventual induced magnetization on the empty d - shell of v sites would allow interlayer coupling by super - superexchange . therefore , magnetic compton scattering and polarized neutron diffraction experiments have been carried out leading to the spin density in momentum space and the magnetization density in real space , respectively . however , detailed and precise analysis of these quantities are required in order to determine the exact contribution of the atomic species involved in the studied system .",
    "quantum chemical modeling is therefore needed to gain insights , at a molecular level , into the electronic structure of the two cobalt - oxide octahedra . in this context , _ ab initio _",
    "cluster calculations were performed for the co@xmath7o@xmath10 and co@xmath9o@xmath10 octahedra yielding precise molecular orbitals ( mo ) and wave functions ( wf ) .",
    "the latter were used to analyze the experimentally observed density distributions .",
    "the refinement of the contribution of each mo / wf , at a quantum chemical level , to the real and momentum space densities simultaneously is a powerful procedure allowing interesting and valuable features of the magnetic form factors to be determined .",
    "the two different clusters co@xmath7o@xmath10 and co@xmath9o@xmath10 were modelled separately . the calculations were performed within the framework of the kohn - sham formulation of the density functional theory using the pc gamess program.@xcite the functional b3lyp was employed to approximate the exchange - correlation interaction .",

    "the two quantum mechanical clusters were surrounded by point charges ( pc ) according to the effective fragment potential method.@xcite as previously reported for other systems,@xcite the choice of the embedding method was shown to be crucial for the physical meaning of the _ ab initio _ calculations . to avoid the electron density leaking out of the cluster ,",
    "a boundary region has been introduced , which is formed by effective core potentials ( ecp ) placed in the nearest cationic positions around the cluster .",
    "thus , the first coordination shell of co@xmath13 and v@xmath14 ions has been described by ecps according to the sbkjc ecp basis set.@xcite as native ecps for co and v do not treat the 3s and 3p electrons as core electrons , those ecps would in fact be too compact due to the higher number of valence electrons . in order to overcome this problem the ecps for mg and al",
    "have been used due to the fact that their ionic radii are closer to those of co and v , respectively . except for the 3d shells ,",
    "the remaining electrons are replaced by an effective potential .",
    "thus , 1565 pc ( 3x3x3 unit cells with the respective co ion in the center ) have been built to mimic the madelung potential on the cluster .",
    "the mo coefficients relevant to the co3d were extracted from the simulations and used to model the magnetic compton profiles ( mcp ) and the magnetic form factors .",
    "co@xmath15v@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals have been grown from self - flux in a zro@xmath1/y crucible by the slow cooling method .",
    "some of the crystals have been ground and investigated at the high - flux neutron powder diffractometer d20 ( institut laue langevin , grenoble ) confirming the absence of parasitic phases .",
    "the nuclear structure of a chosen single crystal has been studied at the four - circle diffractometer d9 ( institut laue langevin , grenoble ) .",
    "a set of more than 500 independent reflections up to @xmath16=0.92 has been measured using two different wavelengths in order to determine the extinction effects ( @xmath17=0.835   , @xmath18=0.512   ) .",
    "the data collection has been performed in the paramagnetic phase at @xmath19=13.5 k , which is just above the nel temperature of 11.2 k. in order to reveal possible structural changes between the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase due to structural phase transitions or magnetostriction an additional nuclear structure investigation has been carried out at the single crystal diffractometer d15 ( institut laue langevin , grenoble ) under the same experimental conditions as the polarized neutron diffraction experiment ( sec .  [",
    "sec : pnd ] ) , i.e. at @xmath19=3.5 k with an applied magnetic field of @xmath20=2 t along the easy axis _ a _ and using a wavelength of @xmath21=0.854   .",
    "the real space magnetization density has been studied at the hot neutron spin polarized two - axes diffractometer 5c1 ( laboratoire lon brillouin , saclay ) .",
    "neutrons from the source are monochromated and polarized by the ( 111 ) reflection of a magnetized heusler crystal cu@xmath1mnal .",
    "the wavelength is 0.84   , which corresponds to the maximum flux of the hot source and is ideal for studying large domains of reciprocal space .",

    "has been applied along the easy axis _",

[ eq : rfl ] ) , the ratios between the spin - up and spin - down intensities , of over 500 independent @xmath24 reflections with @xmath25=0,1,2 have been measured in the ferromagnetic phase at @xmath19=3.5 k. @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the magnetic and nuclear structure factors .",

    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are extinction correction factors of the respective cross - sections according to ref .  .",
    "the investigation of the spin density in momentum space has been carried out at the high energy inelastic scattering beamline bl08w at spring-8 in hyogo , japan .",
    "this beamline is designed for magnetic compton scattering spectroscopy as it offers high energy elliptically polarized x - rays emitted from an elliptic multipole wiggler .",
    "the incident photon beam with an energy range of 170 - 300 kev is monochromated and focused by an asymmetric johann type monochromator using the si ( 620 ) reflection .",
    "the sample magnetization is achieved with a superconducting magnet with a maximum field of 2.5 t and a minimum polarity - switching time of 5 seconds .",
    "the backscattered photon energy is analyzed by a 10-segmented ge solid state detector positioned at a scattering angle of 178.4@xmath12 .",
    "the experiment has been carried out with an incident photon energy of 176.3 kev , which gives a good compromise between the beam intensity and the scattering cross section .",
    "the initial interest of applying this method to co@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 was to map the momentum space spin density of the ferromagnetic phase as a projection onto the _ b@xmath34-c@xmath34 _ plane in order to gather information about the 3d electron spin states and to correlate the results with those obtained from the polarized neutron diffraction experiment , but the experimental conditions and especially the large magnetic anisotropy of the system did not allow that .",
    "the minimal achievable sample temperature is approximately 5.6 k , i.e. close below the magnetic transition into the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "it can be seen in the magnetic phase diagrams of co@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite that at this temperature already weak magnetic fields applied along the _ b _ or _ c _ axis induce a magnetic phase transition into the antiferromagnetic phase , while @xmath35 stabilizes the ferromagnetic one . the necessity of applying a magnetic field of considerable strength and therewith magnetizing the sample along the incident beam in order to increase the magnetic contribution to the scattering cross - section beside the requirement of turning the sample about a vertical axis to be able to reconstruct the two - dimensional momentum density , led to a change of strategy . to make sure not to induce magnetic phase transitions by rotating the sample with respect to the field direction",
    "the measurements have been carried out within the antiferromagnetic phase at @xmath19=7.5 k and by applying a magnetic field of @xmath20=2 t with the induced ferromagnetic component lying in the _ b - c _ plane .",
    "in addition to the trivial directions [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] four",
    "further directional mcps @xmath36 in the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane have been investigated .",
    "an additional profile has been measured along the [ 100 ] direction by decreasing the applied magnetic field to 0.25 t. a directional mcp yields the projection of the spin momentum space density onto the scattering vector , which is by definition @xmath38 : @xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting the momentum wf of an occupied majority ( minority ) spin state .",
    "the compton profiles of the respective sample magnetization states have been recorded for 60 seconds , repeating the cycle @xmath41 $ ] multiple times .",
    "the nuclear structure investigation at 13.5 k on the four - circle diffractometer d9 confirmed the correct phase formation of the orthorhombic structure ( space group cmca ) with @xmath42=6.015(3 )   , @xmath43=11.480(5 )   and @xmath44=8.289(4 )   .",
    "the observed integrated intensities have been corrected for absorption by applying the transmission factor integral @xmath45 $ ] and analyzed by simultaneously fitting a structure model to both datasets with @xmath17 and @xmath18 using fullprof.@xcite the refinement process included the atomic positions and isotropic temperature factors of co and o plus three additional extinction parameters according to an anisotropic shelx - like empirical extinction correction.@xcite the atomic position and temperature factor of v have been fixed in all refinements , because of its low coherent neutron scattering cross section .",

    "the ferromagnetic contribution to the integrated intensity @xmath48 has been canceled out according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the magnetic interaction vector .",
    "the subsequent refinement showed that no considerable change in the nuclear structure has taken place , i.e. the derivation of the @xmath27 from observed flipping ratios by using the observed @xmath28 at @xmath51 k is justified .",
    "all low - angle nuclear reflections suffer considerably from extinction , therefore , special attention has been paid to the extinction of magnetic scattering . as the flipping ratio treatment uses the same extinction parameters for both nuclear and magnetic scattering , it is important to verify , if the extinction effects are indeed comparable .",
    "therefore , three strong magnetic reflections have been measured as a function of applied magnetic field after the sample has been cooled in zero - field to 3.5 k. fig .",
    "[ fig : magext ] shows the integrated intensities of three reflections after the nuclear contribution has been subtracted .",
    "the field dependence of the magnetic contribution reveals a surprising and interesting tendency : instead of increasing with increasing applied field , as one would expect if the cross - tie moments get saturated , the intensity of magnetic scattering drops significantly .",
    "this observation can be explained with field dependent increase of primary extinction . at @xmath20=0 t",
    "the sample exhibits a multidomain state with presumably negligible extinction effects . by increasing the field the magnetic domains",
    "grow until they reach approximately the size of the structural domains . on reaching saturation at @xmath20@xmath520.25 t",
    "the primary extinction effects for magnetic scattering should be comparable to those of nuclear scattering .",
    "the mosaicity which governs secondary extinction should a priori not be affected . in order to verify these assumptions the extinction correction factor",
    "@xmath53 has been calculated for three magnetic reflections using the refined extinction parameters from the nuclear structure refinement according to the anisotropic fullprof model : @xmath54^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] the calculated values have been compared with the observed ones , which can easily be deduced from the intensity ratios at @xmath20=0 t and @xmath20=0.25 t. the results are listed in tab .  [",
    "tab : magext ] .",
    "it can be seen that the calculated extinction factors are to a greater or lesser extent comparable with the observed ones .",
    "nevertheless , the extinction of magnetic scattering seems to be underestimated .       from the calculated mcps",
    "the momentum space spin density has been reconstructed [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mom](b ) ] . the calculated real space magnetization density map [ fig .",
    "[ fig : real](c ) ] has been obtained by a fourier synthesis of the calculated magnetic structure factors .",
    "the main features of the respective density maps coincide well , although some differences are evident : the dip in the momentum space density around @xmath38=0 is not pronounced well in the calculated map and has a shape , which is rotated by 90@xmath12 with respect to the observed map .",
    "this possibly results from strong hybridization effects between the co3d and o2p orbitals .",
    "furthermore , the disagreements between the experimental and calculated mcps are most probably due to the limitation of the cluster calculations . considering a larger sized cluster or the solid state ,",
    "the gap between the experiment and fitting could be reduced .",
    "the real space spin density of the o1 and o3 sites is slightly underestimated .",
    "furthermore , density peaks exist next to the spine site density along the _ z _ axis , which do not coincide with atomic positions .",
    "however , this fact can be attributed to truncation effects in the fourier series .",
    "the study presented here combining several methods reveals very interesting magnetic properties of the kagome staircase system co@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the previous assumption , that the ferromagnetic structure at zero magnetic field is not fully ordered because of the co@xmath7 only exhibiting 1.54 @xmath8 , is disproved .",
    "previous macroscopic magnetization measurements@xcite indeed showed a saturated moment of approximately 3.4 @xmath8 per co site at @xmath20=2 t along _ a _ , but the results of the polarized neutron single - crystal diffraction experiment with adequate extinction correction presented here reveal that the field dependent increase of magnetization stems from the v , o2 and o3 sites .",
    "hereby , the v and o2 site show quite localized magnetization density , while the o3 density seems to be smeared out due to truncation effects in the fourier series .",
    "a periodic _ ab initio _ calculation confirms the existence of magnetization density on the v and o sites and will be presented elsewhere.@xcite the spin polarized density on o2 and o3 , which are those oxygen ions in the co@xmath7o@xmath10 clusters , may be a strong indication for a partially covalent character of the co@xmath7 ions and the reason for their relatively low magnetic moment compared to co@xmath9 .",
    "the magnetization density distribution clearly exhibits the superexchange pathways between the two different co sites , but it indicates also the interlayer coupling , which is mediated by the v - o1 bridge . combining the methods of polarized neutron diffraction and magnetic compton scattering allowed us to refine the occupations of the co3d orbitals in a stable way . like it has been previously reported but with inverted values@xcite the two crystallographically different co ions exhibit different spin polarized orbital occupations .",
    "while the unpaired electrons are equally distributed between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 levels for the co@xmath9 ion , the magnetic signal stems by only 30% from the @xmath5 orbitals for the co@xmath7 ion as a consequence of the spin transfer from the surrounding o ions .",
    "concerning the @xmath4 orbitals of both ions the basal plane orbital @xmath55 is more populated than the apical @xmath56 orbital .",
    "this possibly indicates a higher exchange interaction between the co@xmath9 ions via an intermediate o2 ion . in the case of the co@xmath7 ions it could be a hint that the magnetic exchange with the spine co ions takes place preferentially via an o3 ion .",
    "this research was supported by the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ within the priority program 1178 .",
    "the magnetic compton scattering experiment was performed with the approval of the japan synchrotron radiation research institute ( jasri ) ( proposal no .",
