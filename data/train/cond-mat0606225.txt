    "the phase transitions of the af potts models depend heavily on the number of states @xmath0 , the details of lattice structure , etc .",

    "while this model with only the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions has been studied in detail @xcite , the effect of the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions has many interesting problems to explore @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the present authors have studied the square - lattice af three - state potts model with a staggered polarization field @xcite . by the use of the exact diagonalization calculation of the transfer matrix and the phenomenological renormalization - group analysis , two types of phase transitions",
    "have been discussed in connection with a field theoretical argument . the crossover behavior from the af to the f three - state potts criticality , which was proposed by delfino @xcite , has been confirmed .    the exact diagonalization calculation and the monte carlo simulation play a complementary role in the numerical study .",
    "the energy levels obtained by the exact diagonalization are highly accurate , but the tractable size is limited . on the other hand , although the statistical errors are unavoidable because of the sampling process , the monte carlo simulation can deal with larger systems .",

    "the cluster algorithms are not so efficient for the systems with nnn couplings .",
    "we use the information of the energy dos for the detailed study of the phase transitions . in the wang - landau method , a random walk in energy space is performed with a probability proportional to the reciprocal of the dos , @xmath12 , which results in a flat histogram of energy distribution . since the dos is not known _ a priori _ , it is iteratively updated as @xmath13 every time a random walker visits a state with energy @xmath14 .",
    "a large modification factor @xmath15 is introduced to accelerate the diffusion of the random walk in the early stage of the simulation , and it is gradually reduced to unity by checking the ` flatness ' of the energy histogram .",
