    "time for @xmath260 yields a model similar to the radiation dominated obtained in gr .",
    "as mentioned , in the quintessential scenarios or the early universe studies , a few phenomenological models have been employed .",
    "for example , by assuming two different models , the standard bd theory has been generalized to include an effective cosmological constant : i ) in some investigations , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , an included scalar potential can play the role of the cosmological constant .",
    "this scalar potential can be reduced to a mass term or to a constant .",
    "ii ) whilst in the other models  @xcite , there is no scalar potential , but instead , there is a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath261 .",
    "as seen in the previous subsections , we studied the evolution of the universe for some particular cases , having the general scalar potential dictated from the geometry in @xmath0dimensions .",
    "however , from equation  ( [ eq - pot ] ) , it is impossible to obtain a @xmath262 scalar potential , even by assuming a nonzero integration constant , for the power ",
    "law solution in the case where @xmath263 .",
    "more precisely , by substituting the power  law solution  ( [ power - law - phi ] ) into the corresponding scalar potential , the only way of having a constant scalar potential is to set @xmath141 which is in direct contradiction with the constraint @xmath263 .",
    "( we should mention that having a scalar potential as a linear function of @xmath7 is also impossible . ) in the other words , in our herein cosmological model , in which the scalar potential and the matter content are obtained geometrically from the extra dimensions , imposing a few conditions on the parameters of the model , such that the induced scalar potential takes constant value ( or a linear function of @xmath7 ) while the induced matter has barotropic equation of state , is in direct contradiction with having the power  law solutions for the spatially flat flrw universe .",
    "we also should note that having an induced matter with @xmath264 , which can play the role of cosmological constant , is not allowed for @xmath71 dimensions .",
    "although we have not investigated the case where @xmath141 , we should also remark that , in this case , the logarithmic scalar potential can not be a constant unless we set @xmath265 . therefore , the only appropriate case is to consider the vanishing scalar potential which is obtained by setting @xmath74 or @xmath137 . in the case where @xmath137 , we have @xmath266 , and thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ t-00 ] ) and ( [ t - ii ] ) , we get @xmath267 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , in this case , we further obtain @xmath238 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269 .",
    "these values of parameters of the model lead us to an unknown zero acceleration universe . in the rest of this subsection",

    "then , from ( [ s - om ] ) , the exponent @xmath100 becomes @xmath274 . in order to obtain real values for @xmath100",

    "furthermore , by assuming @xmath276 , only @xmath277 guarantees that the induced energy density takes positive values , and with these conditions , the induced pressure is also positive .    as a particular case ,",
    "let us discuss the radiative fluid , namely @xmath244 .",
    "for this case , by applying @xmath277 , we get @xmath104 and @xmath278 . by substituting these values of @xmath99 and @xmath277 in relation  ( [ s - om ] ) , the exponent of the cosmic time for the bd scalar field",
    "reduces to @xmath138 . in particular , when @xmath71 , we get the following solution @xmath279 which is similar to the nariai solution derived for a radiative fluid in four dimensions . as @xmath280 ( for @xmath71 ) ,",
    "thus the extra dimension contracts as the cosmic time increases .",
    "another case of particular interest is the solution associated with cosmological constant , corresponding to @xmath281 . in bd gravity ,",

    ", we obtain @xmath283 , @xmath284 and @xmath141 . for a four  dimensional space  time , we will have a decelerated expansion and the bd coupling parameter is restricted to @xmath285 .",
    "[ conclusion ] in this manuscript , we applied the dimensional reduction procedure , for a @xmath0dimensional bd scenario .",
    "subsequently , we obtained a modified bd theory in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "namely , with new dynamical features , more concretely , we have shown that , in this scenario , the induced emt , namely @xmath50}}$ ] is composed of three parts .",
    "the first part of the induced emt , i.e. @xmath286}}$ ] , is the @xmath0th part of the metric , which is geometrically induced on a hypersurface . whereas , the second part , @xmath54}}$ ] , depends on the bd scalar field and its derivatives with respect to the @xmath0th coordinate .",
    "the third part is an induced scalar potential that can be derived from the theory , and contributes in a wave equation . in this construction ,",
    "the induced emt obeys a conservation law .",
    "when the bd scalar field takes constant values , the second and third parts of the induced emt , without loss of generality , can be set equal to zero and the theory reduces to the gr setting derived in  @xcite in @xmath1dimensions , as expected .",
    "let us further emphasize some similarities and differences regarding a standard @xmath1dimensional bd theory : within the context of the work at hand , the @xmath0dimensional field equations ( [ ( d+1)-equation-1 ] ) and ( [ ( d+1)-equation-4 ] ) , with a general metric ( [ global - metric ] ) , split naturally into four sets of eqs .",
    "( [ d2say ] ) , ( [ bd - eq - dd ] ) , ( [ d2-phi ] ) and ( [ p - dynamic ] ) , in which eqs .  ( [ bd - eq - dd ] ) and ( [ d2-phi ] ) reproduce the bd field equations on a @xmath1dimensional space  time , with a geometrically induced energy ",
    "momentum source .",
    "equivalently , they would be retrieved from a conventional action .",
    "such a correspondence is guaranteed by the campbell  magaard theorem  @xcite . whereas , eq .  ( [ d2say ] ) has no bd analog , and the set of eqs .",
    "( [ p - dynamic ] ) is a generalized version of a conservation law introduced in the imt .",
    "we investigated solutions associated to the spatially flat flrw in a vacuum ( @xmath4)dimensional space  time . by assuming a power ",
    "law ansatz , ( [ power - law - phi ] ) , we found the general solutions for the equations .",
    "then , we discussed a few particular cases , such as @xmath287dimensional de sitter  like space as well as an extended version of the ohanlon and tupper solution , which describes an empty universe in standard bd theory .",
    "we then employed the mbdt to study the ( @xmath1dimensional ) induced setting . after deriving the energy density , pressure and scalar potential",
    ", we found that the general induced emt describes a perfect fluid . for power ",
    "law solutions , the induced scalar potential is in the forms of the power  law or logarithmic . however , we only considered the power  law case , which yielded a baroscopic equation of state for the effective emt .",
    "we further calculated the @xmath1dimensional energy density and pressure of the bd scalar field , as well as density parameters associated to the induced matter and bd scalar field .",
    "then , in order to meet recent observational data , as well as to compare our results with the case from standard bd theory , we restricted the results to a four  dimensional space  time . we should mention that the model has been constructed entirely from four parameters @xmath2 , @xmath99 , @xmath101 and @xmath100 , which are not independent . by imposing the different physical conditions for each solution , we have obtained the allowed ranges of the present parameters of the model .    in order to discuss on the extended quintessence of the dark energy models and consequently having an accelerating universe ,",
    "the parameter @xmath99 must be taken greater than one . by assuming this condition for @xmath99",
    ", we found that @xmath101 is always negative whereas @xmath100 can take positive as well as negative values .",
    "however , as the negative values of this parameter give a contracting fifth dimension , we restricted the solutions by omitting the solutions associated to positive values of @xmath100 .",
    "further , we also restricted the ranges of the parameters so that weak energy conditions for the induced matter , as well as matter associated to bd scalar field , would be satisfied .",
    "these physical conditions give a permissable range for the bd coupling parameter presented by ( [ omega-s.quint-2 ] ) or equivalently by ( [ omega-n.quint-2 ] ) . by applying the physical conditions , for an accelerating expansion ,",
    "the allowed ranges of @xmath2 have been plotted versus @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the resulted ranges for @xmath2 were further constrained to match with other limits , reported by recent observational data for the parameters of the model .",
    "finally , as fig .  [ quint-obser-omega-r-n.fig ] shows , we found a narrow region of the bd coupling parameter in the @xmath288 parameter space , for small negative values of @xmath100 and permitted ranges of the density parameters obtained from observations .",
    "however , these values for @xmath2 are  not in accordance with the constraints on @xmath2 reported by the tests of the solar system .",
    "although the allowed ranges of the bd coupling parameter in our model are very similar to those obtained in investigations in the context of conventional bd theory , we should stress that our herein model leads us to accelerating solutions based on fundamental concept , i.e. , from the geometrical presence of the extra dimension , rather than by means of some _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",
    "we also probed the variation of the gravitational coupling and the age of the universe .",
    "the result is in accordance with the observational data  @xcite . in our model , as @xmath101 takes negative values , the gravitational coupling increases with cosmic time .    in order to proceed the discussions on the dust and radiation dominated universe",
    ", we further obtained the decelerated parameter , @xmath218 , and expressed all the induced quantities in terms of the parameter of the equation of state associated to the induced matter , @xmath150 , the exponent associated to the scale factor , @xmath99 , the number of the dimensions , @xmath1 , and the cosmic time  @xmath80 for a few well  known particular cases of the equation of state , namely , matter  dominated and radiation  dominated universe .",
    "the results of the model have shown that the cosmological model based on the mbdt can describe , by means of assuming a few required physical conditions , an accelerated universe as well as a decelerated universe .",
    "we have plotted the allowed ranges of bd coupling parameter . also , in fig .",
    "[ wphi - r - matt ] , for a particular value of @xmath2 associated to the matter  dominated case , we have specified @xmath224 for small values of @xmath99 , which shows a proper range consistent with the recent observational results .    for a dust fluid , we also argued that the terms inside the brackets of equation ( [ dd - frw - shetab ] ) , which represents a quantity associated to the strong energy condition , decides to have a decelerating or an accelerating expansion .",
    "for the particular case of the dust in four dimensions , by expressing all the quantities versus @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we found that when a nonzero @xmath101 is restricted to the ranges @xmath232 and @xmath234 , then the universe is in the phase of deceleration and acceleration , respectively .",
    "for @xmath234 , the deceleration parameter is always restricted to the range @xmath243 , while for @xmath232 , it takes positive values . in both of these cases",
    ", the total energy density satisfies the weak energy condition .",
    "also , a zero acceleration phase is described when @xmath237 ( corresponds to @xmath238 ) , in which also the weak energy condition is satisfied .",
    "consequently , we found that in the case where @xmath213 , the herein cosmological model can be considered as an unified model for dark matter  dark energy .",
    "we also mention that , in this case , the extra dimension contracts as the cosmological time increases .",
    "we should also note that , similar to the most of the conventional models of bd theory , the bd coupling parameter takes small negative values , which is , as mentioned , in contradiction with solar system experiments .",
    "different phenomenological approaches have been trying to resolve the problems with the cosmological models in the bd theory , especially the trouble with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "one way to get out of this problem can be assuming a varying @xmath2 , namely , @xmath289 instead of the constant one . in the context of mbdt , unfortunately , using such an approach would flunk  @xcite .",
    "we should also stress that the observational constrains on @xmath2 are only in the weak field limit .",
    "it would be of interest to study a case in which a scalar potential can play the role of an effective cosmological constant .",
    "however , as in the mbdt , both the induced matter and the scalar potential are dictated from the geometry of the extra dimension , thus , in the power ",
    "law cosmological setting associated to the mbdt , neither such a scalar potential nor an induced matter with @xmath264 is obtained .",
    "instead , we can investigate the case where the scalar potential is zero and obtain the corresponding cosmological phases . by assuming a vanishing induced scalar potential",
    ", we studied a particular case of cosmological power  law solutions resembling to the nariai class  @xcite , obtained for the four  dimensional flat flrw universe with @xmath270 and @xmath271<0 $ ] , for a perfect fluid equation of state .",
    "we also found that , in the other special case where @xmath137 , the scalar potential vanishes and leads to an unknown zero acceleration universe .",

    "three key assumptions have been considered within a metric similar to  ( [ kk - metric ] ) , but a significant difference , namely , with non  vanishing off  diagonal terms @xmath299 corresponding to the electromagnetic potentials . however , here , we also assume the three key assumptions of the original kk theory , but instead , we assume that there are no off - diagonal terms in the above metric .",
    "furthermore , in order to respect to homogeneity and isotropy , we assume that @xmath300 is a generalized flrw metric on the @xmath0dimensional manifold @xmath291 and @xmath301 is a diagonal riemannian metric on @xmath292 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath302 ( where we have chosen @xmath303 s as dimensionless coordinates ) where the purely geometrical metric @xmath304 describes the @xmath78-dimensional internal space and @xmath305 , which is a function of @xmath0dimensional coordinate @xmath298 , stands for the size of the space .",
    "thus , we have @xmath306 in which @xmath307 is related to the volume of the compact manifold @xmath292 , @xmath308 , via @xmath309 , where @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 are the determinant of the corresponding metrics .    by adapting the kk first key assumption ,",
    "the action associated to a @xmath5dimensional space - time is written as @xmath313 where @xmath314 stands for the ricci curvature associated to the metric @xmath315 and @xmath316 denotes the @xmath5dimensional gravitational coupling . in order to derive the effective action on @xmath291",
    ", we can compute the integral over the @xmath317 dimensions by assuming that the above integral is composed of multiplication of two integrals , one over the @xmath0 dimensions and the other over @xmath78 dimensions .",
