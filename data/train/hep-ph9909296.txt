    "the phase structure of @xmath11 at non - zero temperature and baryon density is important for the physics of neutron stars and heavy ion collisions .",
    "an approximate phase structure for qcd with two massless quarks has been mapped out in various mean field and perturbative approximations and a rich structure has emerged . for a recent review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in addition to the well known chiral symmetry broken and restored phases recent investigations have revealed the possibility of a color superconducting phase at low temperatures and relatively high densities @xcite @xcite @xcite . in the chiral condensation regime at zero chemical potential ,",
    "the phase transition to the unbroken mode is second order as we raise the temperature @xcite .",
    "as we increase the chemical potential at fixed low temperature there is a first order transition to a superconducting phase .",
    "there is also a regime where as we increase the temperature the phase transition from the chirally broken phase to the unbroken phase is first order , so that somewhere along the line separating these phases there is a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "these results are summarized in @xcite .",
    "one of the more interesting questions is what happens in a dynamical situation such as a heavy ion collision , in which the system traverses the various phase transitions as it expands and cools .",
    "one would like to study the correlation functions to see whether there is qualitatively different behavior in crossing the first order or second order transition regions as a function of the proper evolution time and whether this difference would lead to some interesting experimental signatures at rhic .    in order to get a better handle on this latter question",
    ", we propose a simple 1 + 1 dimensional model which contains several of the features of two flavor massless qcd in mean field approximation ( similar phase structure and asymptotic freedom ) which would lend itself to dynamical computational simulations pertinent to the ( one dimensional ) expansion of a lorentz contracted disc of quark matter .",
    "thus we hope to explore the behavior of a system of  quarks \" evolving through first and second order phase transitions to either a final state with chiral condensates or to a superconducting final state .",
    "this calculation would be similar in spirit to those that were done in exploring the chiral phase transition in the linear sigma model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to mapping out the phase structure of our model at finite temperature and chemical potential in a large-@xmath12 approximation , for use in obtaining initial conditions for our future dynamical calculations .",
    "our simple model combines the gross - neveu model @xcite with a model for cooper pairs that we introduced recently @xcite .",
    "it turns out to have many of the features of qcd that we ultimately want to capture in more realistic calculations .",
    "namely , the theory in the gross - neveu sector has the same second - order , first - order , tricritical point behavior for the chiral condensate @xmath13 as a function of temperature @xcite and chemical potential @xcite @xcite as qcd with two massless flavors . adding the second interaction also adds a new phase where there is superconductivity at some finite chemical potential as also expected in qcd with two massless flavors .",
    "the model has a well defined @xmath14 expansion and is asymptotically free so that it does not suffer from the cutoff dependences of @xmath15 dimensional effective field theories considered by others @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus we will be investigating a 1 + 1 dimensional model governed by two independent couplings :  the original gross - neveu term @xcite that promotes the condensation of @xmath16 , and the term considered in our earlier paper @xcitethat produces a @xmath17 condensate .",
    "we first determine the unrenormalized effective potential at leading order in a large - n expansion , by introducing collective coordinates for the @xmath18 , and @xmath19 operators , and integrating out the fermions in the usual fashion by using the hubbard - stratonovich trick @xcite .    at zero temperature and chemical potential",
    "we derive a closed - form analytic expression for the renormalized effective potential .",
    "we find that there is one dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , independent of the renormalization scale , whose value determines which of the condensates is present .",
    "this situation might be described as  partial dimensional transmutation \" : the unrenormalized theory has two bare couplings whereas the renormalized one has a renormalization scale , which is arbitrary ( but which can be related to the physical fermion or cooper pair gap mass ) , and a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 independent of this scale , that controls the physics .",
    "we find that the gap equations have three types of solution :  two in which one or the other of the condensates vanish , and a third , mixed case , in which both condensates are non - vanishing .",
    "it turns out , however , that the true minimum of the effective potential is at a point where one of the condensates vanishes except at the particular point @xmath20 ( to be discussed further below)where one is at a first order phase transition so that phase coexistence can occur . depending on the sign of @xmath2 we therefore have very different behavior at zero temperature and chemical potential namely either chiral condensates or cooper - pairs being present .",
    "the phase structure of the limiting theories which have only one coupling constant is easy to determine analytically , and we include for completeness a discussion of these two particular cases which benchmark our numerical study of the general case . performing the integration in our expression for the renormalized effective potential numerically , we then map out the phase diagram for the more general two coupling constant case as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we find a regime of ( positive ) @xmath2 which remarkably mimics the phase structure of two flavor qcd described above .",
    "it has a tricritical point as well as a first order phase transition as a function of chemical potential from the chirally broken phase into the superconducting phase .",
    "we determine the tricritical point and the critical temperature at which the superconducting phase transition occurs as a function of @xmath2 . as we decrease the magnitude of @xmath2 , first the regime of first order phase transition from the chiral phase disappears , and then at the special point @xmath20 the possibility of a chiral symmetry broken phase totally disappears so that when @xmath4 one only has the possibility for a superconducting broken symmetry mode at low temperatures .",
    "we consider the most general lagrangian with quartic fermion couplings , possessing @xmath21 flavor symmetry and discrete chiral symmetry .",

    "the first quartic term is the usual gross - neveu interaction , whereas the second such term , which differs in the arrangement of its flavor indices , induces the pairing force to leading order in @xmath24 .",
    "this term is possible because we demand only @xmath21 symmetry as opposed to the @xmath25 symmetry of the original gross - neveu model . in the final term , @xmath5 is the chemical potential .",
    "strictly speaking , a @xmath1 condensate can not form , because it breaks the @xmath26 of fermion number and hence violates coleman s theorem @xcite . similarly , @xmath27 as well as @xmath1 condensates can not exist at finite temperature in one spatial dimension because of the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",

    "as we increase the chemical potential at low temperatures there is a first order phase transition into a phase with cooper pairs . at and near the phase transition line",

    "as we increase the temperature at fixed large chemical potential , the system undergoes a second order transition into the unbroken mode , with the critical temperature depending only on @xmath2 and not @xmath5 .",

    "figure 2 is in the regime where @xmath229 so that it displays a tricritical point . for values of @xmath230 , the chirally broken phase",
    "only can be restored via a second order phase transition .",
    "this case is illustrated in fig.4 which is for @xmath231 . in between the chirally broken and superconducting phases",
    "is a coexistence curve .",
    "the intersection of this curve with the line @xmath210 can be determined as a function of @xmath2 which we will shall do below .",
    "the existence of two phases having the same energy is shown in the 3d plot of the effective potential as a function of @xmath232 in fig.5 and in the two dimensional slices of this figure shown in figs . 6 and 7 .",

    "all the plots are for @xmath234 which is numerically determined to lie along the first order line separating the chiral condensation phase from the cooper condensation phase . as @xmath2 approaches zero , the coexistence curve approaches @xmath235 and after that one no longer has a phase with chiral symmetry breakdown .",
    "infinitesimally to either side of the coexistence curve we are at two separate minima of the potential . in each phase",

    "( [ eq : constant ] ) .    at @xmath210 it is possible to analytically determine the value of the chemical potential as a function of @xmath243 as well the value of @xmath123 at the minimum .",
    "on the left hand side of the coexistence we need to evaluate the gn effective potential in the regime where @xmath244 , since the phase transition to the superconducting phase always occurs in that regime .",
    "thus we have @xmath245 on the right hand side we need to evaluate the zero temperature effective potential for @xmath246 .",
    "we have on the cooper condensation side , @xmath247 the quantity @xmath139 is determined by that value of @xmath123 that minimizes this function , namely @xmath248 or @xmath249 inserting this value into the equation equating the value of the potential on both sides of the phase transition we then obtain the critical value of the chemical potential @xmath250",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a 1 + 1 dimensional model possessing @xmath21 flavor symmetry and discrete chiral symmetry , and have found a phase structure remarkably similar to that conjectured for 2-flavor qcd .",
    "we have derived the general forms for the effective potential in leading order in @xmath24 .",
    "we have analyzed the case @xmath105 analytically , showing how the phase structure is governed by the renormalization group invariant @xmath2 . for @xmath105",

    "what we have found is that when there is chiral symmetry breakdown in the vacuum sector ( @xmath252 ) , there are at least three different regions . in the low temperature regime , as we increase the chemical potential there is a first order phase transition to a regime which has a cooper pair gap ( superconductivity ) but no chiral symmetry breakdown . along and near the phase transition line",
    ", there is a regime where the two phases coexist like ice and water . at @xmath210",
    "we explicitly determine the value of the chemical potential at which this occurs and also the value of the cooper pair gap as a function of @xmath2 . at high enough temperatures",
    "both symmetries are restored . in particular",
    "if @xmath253 , then there is also a tricritical point so that depending on the value of @xmath5 the phase transition out of the chirally broken phase will be either first or second order .",
    "we illustrated the phase structure of this model by showing the phase diagram of this model as a function of temperature and chemical potential for representative values of @xmath2 .",
    "we also plotted the effective potential at a representative place where there is phase coexistence . in the opposite case @xmath4",
    "one finds that in the vacuum sector the theory has a cooper pair gap but no chiral symmetry breaking . in that case the theory has a transition at high temperatures to the unbroken mode where the gap goes to zero .    using this toy model we intend to study how the phase transition from the high temperature to low temperature regime proceeds in time during an expansion of an initial lorentz contracted disc of quark matter starting from various initial conditions related to different points on this phase diagram .",
    "we hope to determine how various correlation functions depend on the initial conditions of a scattering experiment , assuming that it produces an initial state in local chemical and thermal equilibrium somewhere on the phase diagram we obtained in this paper .",
