    "a dense resonant medium is a model of two - level medium which takes into account near dipole - dipole ( ndd ) interactions between atoms .",
    "ndd interactions described by local field correction lead to appearance of intrinsic optical bistability @xcite or change the characteristics of such effects as optical switching @xcite , soliton formation @xcite , etc .",
    "ndd interactions effects are often treated as a result of nonlinear dynamic shift of atomic resonance from the frequency of input radiation .",
    "the efficiency of this process is governed by the value @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the transition dipole moment , @xmath2 is the planck constant , @xmath3 is the rate of transverse relaxation .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is usually referred to as a constant of ndd interactions and is limited by the volume density of two - level atoms @xmath5 .",
    "though the magnitude of @xmath4 is extremely important , the static detuning @xmath6 of light frequency from atomic resonance should be taken into account as well , as it determines existence regions for a number of phenomena in dense resonant media .",
    "for example , local intrinsic optical bistability ( iob ) occurs in thin films if the parameter of ndd interactions satisfies the condition @xcite @xmath7 so that its minimal value required for iob amounts to @xmath8 @xcite at the detuning @xmath9 .",
    "another effect is connected with appearance of the so - called incoherent solitons which require static detuning to be negative @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "detuning should not be too large : if it is much greater than ndd interaction parameter , the resonant medium behaves as a dilute one @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why it is often assumed to be zero in the problem of ultrashort pulse propagation through the dense resonant medium .",
    "since in existing literature there is no consistent analysis of static frequency detuning influence on pulse propagation in dense resonant medium , we try to fill up this gap in the present paper .",
    "we consider coherent pulse transformation in a dense resonant medium with realistic values of ndd interaction parameter and apply nonzero detunings which are large enough to cause significant effects .",
    "another aspect of the present research , which is of particular interest , is connected with pulse propagation in nonuniform dense medium .",
    "periodic variations of its linear parameters form the one - dimensional photonic crystal .",
    "the problem of enhancement of nonlinear pulse transformation effectiveness and pulse controlling by another pulse in such systems is also investigated for the case of nonzero detuning .",
    "the paper contains three sections . in sec .",
    "[ drm ] the main equations and parameters are considered , as well as the problem of medium density .",
    "the peculiarities of pulse compression in a dense resonant medium and photonic crystal with it in the case , when frequency detuning is present , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ compr ] .",
    "[ gates ] is devoted to a perspective from practical viewpoint result connected with interaction between two pulses  realization of optical logic elements on the basis of nonlinear photonic crystal .",
    "as it is demonstrated , detuning of nonlinear medium from resonance plays crucial role allowing to make the operation of logic gates faster and more stable .",
    "dynamics of pulse propagation in dense resonant medium are described in semiclassical approach by the system of generalized maxwell - bloch equations @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the population difference , @xmath12 is the microscopic ( atomic ) polarization ; @xmath13 is the rate of longitudinal relaxation ; @xmath14 is the light speed in vacuum ; @xmath15 is the wavenumber , and @xmath16 is the background dielectric permittivity ( linear and dispersionless ) .",
    "macroscopic electric field @xmath17 is expressed via its amplitude @xmath18 as @xmath19 $ ] ; similarly for macroscopic nonlinear polarization we have @xmath20 $ ] .    the system of equations ( [ dpdt]-[max ] ) can be written in dimensionless form as follows : @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 are dimensionless time and space arguments ; @xmath24 is the dimensionless amplitude of electric field ; @xmath25 is the normalized static frequency detuning ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; and @xmath16 is the background dielectric permittivity .    in the present paper",
    "the input signals are assumed to be coherent gaussian pulses with amplitude @xmath29 , i.e. , for pulse duration @xmath30 , the inequality is valid : @xmath31 . in our calculations",
    "the parameters of the medium and pulse are as follows : @xmath32 ps and @xmath33 ps , pulse duration @xmath34 fs and the wavelength @xmath35 @xmath1 m .",
    "pulse amplitude can be measured in the units of @xmath36 , which is a natural parameter connected with optical switching @xcite .",
    "a pulse with @xmath37 inverts the medium and then returns it exactly to the ground state , so that it can be treated as a @xmath38-pulse .",
    "periodic variation of background dielectric constant @xmath16 describes the situation of one - dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal . in order to accurately take into account processes connected with dispersion ,",
    "the numerical simulation of the system of equations ( [ dpdtau]-[maxdl ] ) is implemented on the basis of approach developed in @xcite .    the additional nonlinear term with @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ dpdtau ] ) , which couples polarization and population difference , is responsible for near dipole - dipole interactions . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , influence of this term on coherent pulse propagation ( in contrast to consideration in stationary regime ) is negligible at realistic values of the parameter @xmath4 which is usually limited to several units ( at best , @xmath40 ) . though it will be the case further , the dense resonant medium has a very important advantage over dilute media .",
    "the density of the medium is present in the right hand side of the wave equation ( [ maxdl ] ) due to the macroscopic polarization definition ( it measures the dipole moment of macroscopic volume ) and , hence , influences on pulse propagation .",
    "this influence is not physically connected with ndd interactions ( formally , there is just the same combination of parameters @xmath41 ) and determines spatial scale of nonlinear effects in the resonant two - level medium .",
    "high values of the density and , consequently , of the constant @xmath4 allow to obtain such phenomena as pulse compression on significantly reduced distances .",
    "indeed , the distance of optimal compression ( limited by the processes of diffraction , dispersion and energy absorbtion ) @xcite approximately equals @xmath42 for @xmath43 , while for @xmath40 it is only about @xmath44 ( for the pulse with @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus , the large density of resonant medium is important to increase effectiveness of nonlinear effects and compactness of their applications due to right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ maxdl ] ) , though it does not provide any fundamentally new phenomena connected with ndd interactions term in eq .",
    "( [ dpdtau ] ) .",
    "the previous results @xcite were obtained for the case of exact resonance , i.e. detuning @xmath46 of the field frequency from atomic resonance was zero .",
    "further we consider influence of nonzero detuning on pulse compression in the dense resonant medium and photonic crystal containing it .",
    "let us consider propagation of short coherent ( @xmath47 ) pulse in a dense resonant medium with ndd interaction constant @xmath40 and background permittivity @xmath48 ( other parameters are stated in the previous section ) , and pulse intensity is high enough to obtain inversion of medium , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to assume that influence of frequency detuning @xmath46 becomes significant when it is comparable with this dimensionless value @xmath50 , too .",
    "this is proved by fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( here and further pulse amplitude and detuning of the medium are measured in the units of @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is seen that , when increasing detuning from the resonance , the final quasistationary level of population difference is shifted from the fully inverted state ( if detuning is absent ) almost to the ground state ( for @xmath53 ) . at the same time",
    "the effectivity of pulse compression is decreasing ( see fig . [",
    "the sign of frequency detuning almost does not affect the behavior of pulse in the dense resonant medium , according to the comparison of results for @xmath54 and @xmath55 demonstrated in fig .",
    "note that the detuning @xmath56 corresponds ( for parameters used ) to the frequency shift of about @xmath57 .    nevertheless , the same or even higher pulse compression can be reached for more thick layers .",
    "this means that , for @xmath58 , longer distances are needed to provide effective nonlinear interaction of pulse with the dense resonant medium and , hence , the distance of optimal compression ( limited by diffraction and dispersion ) is increasing , as well .",
    "for example , it amounts to about @xmath44 for @xmath59 , while for @xmath54 it is approximately @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "another negative influence of frequency detunings is connected with the effect of compensation of dispersion spreading in nonlinear photonic crystals found in ref .",
    "while pulse spreads rapidly as it propagates in linear photonic crystal ( which is an element with high level of dispersion ) , nonlinear compression allows to compensate this widening .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that this property is significantly reduced for @xmath54 ( several low - intensive pulses appear instead of a single high - intensive one ) and , especially , for @xmath55 ( one broadened low - intensive pulse ) .",
    "thus , off - resonant interaction of a single light pulse with high enough detunings @xmath58 with the dense two - level medium results in decrease of efficiency of such important processes as pulse compression and dispersion spreading compensation .",
    "however , frequency detuning is turned out to be useful or even necessary condition for two - pulse interactions and , in particular , for realization of optical logic elements on the basis of nonlinear photonic structure .",
    "in ref . @xcite it was shown that pulse intensity can be controlled with another pulse in the scheme of two pulses copropagating in a resonant two - level medium . moreover , using of photonic crystal allows to significantly enhance the efficiency of this process .",
    "this phenomenon is a basic idea for optical logic elements to be considered .",
    "possibility of optical logic operations is one of the most prospective results in nonlinear optics of photonic crystals .",
    "usually logic gates are realized by using two- and three - dimensional photonic band - gap structures with defects which form waveguides and nonlinear resonators ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references there ) .",
    "such systems must have , at least , two inputs for initial signals and one output for resulting one .",
    "it seems to be much more simple to use one - dimensional structures with the same entry for both input signals .",
    "an example of one - dimensional logic gates on the basis of nonlinear semiconductor heterostructure was given in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of one - dimensional logic elements based on photonic crystal with dense resonant medium is to be discussed further .",
    "the important property of the gates proposed is that the same nonlinear structure can serve for different logic gates , depending on the intensity of input signals .",
    "( similar property was used in @xcite to demonstrate optical elements in stationary regime . ) the first pulse changes the characteristics of nonlinear medium , as it propagates in it , while the second one interacts with this modified medium .",
    "this effect can be made more sharp by using photonic crystal . in this case",
    "specific reflection and transmission properties of this structure become essential .",
    "first , let us consider the case @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the example of numerical simulation of eqs .",
    "( [ dpdtau]-[maxdl ] ) for the photonic crystal with reflectivity @xmath61 at the main wavelength @xmath62 .",
    "different logic operations can be achieved for different levels of input intensities . or gate ( disjunction ) corresponds to the case when , in both cases of one and two pulses on the entrance , one obtains approximately the same peak intensity on the output .",
    "this situation occurs for the input pulses with the intensities @xmath63 ( in units of @xmath50 ) and is demonstrated in fig .",
    "the results for transmission of these pulses are summed up in the section @xmath64 of table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "it is possible to say that this section represents a truth table for the or element considered .",
    ".[tab : table1]table of output peak intensities ( truth tables ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     and gate ( conjunction ) occurs when , as a result of nonlinear interaction of two pulses , the intensity of the transmitted one is much greater than in the case of a single pulse .",
    "this situation takes place for @xmath65 and is shown in fig .",
    "the corresponding truth table ( table [ tab : table1 ] , section @xmath66 ) shows that the state when both signals are present ( upper or and - state ) gives almost @xmath67-times higher peak output intensity than the state when one of them is absent ( lower state ) .",
    "finally , not operation can be realized as follows .",
    "propagation of a single pulse @xmath68 gives the output peak intensity of about @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]c ) , so that it can be considered as on - state . by using another pulse of @xmath70 , the output intensity is dramatically decreased to @xmath71 , i.e. more than by a factor of three .",
    "this low level of transmitted intensity corresponds to the off - state .",
    "this effect of switching between on- and off - states forms the basis of not gate .",
    "its truth table is shown in section @xmath72 of table [ tab : table1 ] .    as it is seen from the table [ tab : table1 ] ,",
    "the gates also can be realized for other combinations of input pulse intensities .",
    "for example , or gate occurs when @xmath73 , @xmath68 , while for the reverse case ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) one obtains and operation .",
    "as it was mentioned , result of interaction between pulses strongly depends on the properties of photonic band - gap structure and , in particular , on its reflectivity .",
    "for example , if we take photonic crystal with large linear reflectivity , namely @xmath76 ( it can be made by changing the thickness @xmath77 to @xmath78 @xmath1 m ) , logic operations described above become impossible .",
    "for the pulses with the amplitude @xmath65 ( it was the and gate in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) the results of pulse propagation are as follows : output intensity of @xmath79 for a single pulse and @xmath80 for two pulses , i.e. there is no pronounced and - state .",
    "the contrast between states in other cases gets less sharp , too .",
    "thus , realization of the optical logic operations is the result of consistent change of pulse intensities and nonlinear photonic crystal properties : during propagation , pulse changes the characteristics of nonlinear photonic band - gap structure , which , in turn , has an influence on the pulse intensities .",
    "this mutual change leads to complexity of the effect of logic operations and nonobviousness of its appearance at certain parameters of the system .",
    "now let us consider the results of simulations for the case @xmath56 which are represented in table [ tab : table1 ] ( two last columns ) .",
    "it is seen that frequency detuning increases the contrast between lower and upper states of the and gate . moreover , or and",
    "not gates ( at @xmath59 ) become less pronounced or even transform to the and gate when the detuning is present .",
    "this is especially typical for negative detuning @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the system with detuning can be used to obtain high - contrast and operation , while or and not gates are realized at @xmath59 .",
    "it is important , that and gate with detuning has another advantage connected with its bit rate .    since the logic elements described above are based on interaction between one - by - one propagating pulses , a certain time interval should separate sequential realizations of logic operations",
    "this period provides independent interaction of pulses with nonlinear medium and characterizes a bit rate of the logic gates proposed . in general , it is determined by the relaxation times of the resonant medium",
    ". then the bit rate can be calculated as @xmath81 , i.e. about @xmath82 gbit / s .",
    "it is not high level , as compared with kerr - type structures ( see , for example , @xcite ) . nevertheless , in some cases this rate",
    "can be increased .",
    "[ fig6]a shows propagation of two pulses with @xmath83 used in or gate at @xmath59 .",
    "it is seen that time interval of about @xmath84 between input signals is enough for independent propagation of pulses and operation of or gate . for the parameters used in simulations we have @xmath34 fs and @xmath85 ps , which is much less than relaxation times of the resonant medium .",
    "hence , the rate of logic gates operation , which can be estimated as @xmath86 , amounts to a value of more than @xmath87 gbit / s .",
    "obviously , even greater bit rates can be achieved for or gate due to weak interactions between pulses in this case .    however , this is not the case for and gate at @xmath59 .",
    "propagation of two single pulses with @xmath88 separated by the time interval of @xmath84 does not give two independent low states of and gate ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b , solid line ) .",
    "this means that pulses interact due to slow relaxation of the medium . as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , presence of frequency detuning results in faster relaxation of the dense resonant medium .",
    "this can be used to increase bit rate of and gate .",
    "indeed , the interaction between pulses is significantly weaker for @xmath54 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) or even almost absent for @xmath55 ( dotted line ) .",
    "thus , frequency detunings @xmath89 are useful to realize ultrafast ( more than @xmath87 gbit / s ) logic operation ( in particular , and ) .",
    "summing up , propagation effects for light pulses with frequency detuned from the atomic resonance in the dense two - level medium significantly differs from those for resonant radiation .",
    "such important phenomenon as pulse compression shifts towards larger distances , while compensation of dispersion spreading in photonic crystal becomes less pronounced .",
    "special attention is attracted to possibitity of logic gates realization in nonlinear photonic crystals .",
    "the type of logic element is governed by the intensity of input pulses .",
    "it turned out that stable and fast or and not gates can be obtained in the system with zero frequency detuning .",
    "detuning becomes necessary in the case of and gate resulting in fast relaxation and increasing bit rate to the level of more than @xmath87 gbit / s .",
    "note that the recompense for simplicity and ultrafast operation of the logic gates considered is high level of peak intensity of input pulses required to observe the effects described above . while , for stationary cases of logic elements @xcite or optical switching @xcite , input intensities are needed to be of about units and tens kw/@xmath90 , in our case peak intensity reaches values of the order of gw/@xmath90 .",
    "this situation seems to be typical for usage of ultrashort light pulses .",
    "the reason is that approximately the same energy as in stationary regime should be transferred in much shorter time in pulse regime .",
    "can the effects described be really observed ? in this paper we investigated this possibility in principle , but not a particular device .",
    "nevertheless , the used characteristics of the dense resonant medium ( the relaxation times and the constant @xmath4 ) , which is responsible for nonlinear interaction , are typical for usually discussed candidates  dense gases and excitonic media @xcite . at the same time , the parameters of photonic crystal ( background refractive indices , layer thicknesses , number of periods ) are not so important , because any changes in reflectivity spectrum of the structure can be compensated , for example , by adjusting the thickness of the layers .",
    "thus , though the structure considered is quite hypothetical , there is no reason to say that it is not realistic ."
