    "abundances of planetary nebulae ( pne ) have long been used to aid in the understanding of the chemical history of the milky way .",
    "certain elements such as argon and sulfur ( and neon as long as the initial mass is not near 3 @xmath0 and oxygen if initial mass of the progenitor star is @xmath1 , @xcite ) are not changed in the course of the evolution of the low and intermediate mass precursor stars of pne .",
    "thus the abundances of these elements give the chemical composition of the cloud from which the pne progenitor stars formed .",
    "many abundance studies have been made of pne ( as well as stars and regions ) in the galactic disk , leading to the determination of abundance gradients across the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to the high extinction toward the bulge , there is a relative paucity of abundance studies of pne as well as stars and regions in the bulge .",
    "galactic bulges and spheroids may contain half of the stars in the local universe @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding their chemical evolution and formation is important to a general theory of galaxy formation .",
    "insights into our own galactic bulge formation have implications for bulge formation in general .",
    "abundances of galactic bulge planetary nebulae ( gbpne ) have the potential to answer questions about how the bulge formed . for example",
    ", what type of collapse formed the bulge ( dissipational or dissipationless ) ? and , has secular evolution within the galaxy since bulge formation caused a significant amount of star formation within the bulge @xcite ? at a bare minimum , a difference between abundance gradients of pne in the bulge and disk would imply that they formed in separate processes .",
    "the large extinction toward the gbpne makes infrared ( ir ) lines preferable to optical lines for determining their abundances .",
    "additionally , infrared lines provide essential data on important ionization stages of argon , neon , and sulfur as well as for oxygen .",
    "we complement the ir data with optical data where necessary , so that we need no or only small ionization correction factors ( icfs ) to account for unobserved stages of ionization .",
    "finally , abundances derived from ir lines depend only weakly on the electron temperature @xcite .",
    "all of these factors lead to more accurately determined abundances than previously possible with optical lines alone .",
    "likewise , ir spectra are well suited to study the various dust features of gbpne because signatures of both oxygen - rich dust ( in the form of crystalline silicates ) and carbon - rich dust ( in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ; pahs ) can be observed if they are present .",
    "abundances for a number of galactic disk planetary nebulae ( gdpne ) were determined with the use of spectra taken with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , _ iso _ lacked the sensitivity to study pne further than 34 kpc away from the sun . as a result ,",
    "_ iso _ only studied two bulge pne , m1 - 42 and m2 - 36 . due to the better sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ;",
    "* ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite we are able to obtain spectra of gbpne closer to the galactic center ; the furthest gbpn in our sample is about 10 kpc from the sun .    in this paper",
    "we present _ spitzer _ irs spectra of eleven gbpne .",
    "the next section describes the _ spitzer _ data , while  [ supplementary_data ] describes the supplementary data we use . in  [ data_analysis ] we describe the data analysis , deriving ionic and total abundances of argon , neon , sulfur , and oxygen .",
    "additionally we identify the crystalline silicate features and measure pah fluxes .",
    "finally we discuss what our results imply for the evolution of the galactic bulge and its pne in  [ discussion ] and conclude in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we observed eleven gbpne with the _ spitzer _ irs between september 2006 and september 2007 as part of the guaranteed time observation program 30550 . in order to minimize slit losses , peakup with 0.4  positional accuracy",
    "was performed for the six pne where it was possible , while blind pointing with @xmath21  positional accuracy was done for the remaining five pne .",
    "we observed these pne with the irs short - low ( sl ) , short - high ( sh ) , and long - high ( lh ) modules , covering the wavelength range from 5 to 40 . in order to subtract the background and minimize the effect of rogue pixels",
    ", we took off - source observations for sh and lh ; for the sl module we subtracted the background by differencing the orders .",
    "the data were taken in staring mode so that spectra were obtained at two nod positions along each irs slit . for sh and lh , a short exposure time of six seconds",
    "was used to keep the bright lines from saturating , with a total of four cycles for redundancy and to aid in the removal of cosmic rays ; for the sl module , data were taken in three cycles of fourteen seconds each .",
    "table [ basicdata ] gives the object names , their astronomical observation request ( aor ) keys and coordinates .",
    "the sources were selected to ensure they belong to the bulge according to the following criteria .",
    "( 1 ) foremost , the best criterion for ensuring bulge membership is having galactic coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "all of the sources were selected to meet this criterion .",
    "( 2 ) we selected objects with high radial velocities , except for two objects , png001.6 - 01.3 and png002.1 + 03.3 , where they are unknown and whose iras fluxes and positions indicate that they are members of the bulge , @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) finally , the objects have diameters @xmath5 5",
    ". @xcite consider all pne with diameters @xmath6 12  to be foreground objects , and thus choosing small diameters helped to ensure bulge membership .",
    "table [ basicdata ] gives the radial velocities and diameters of our gbpne .",
    "additionally , in order to make certain that we could get good _ spitzer _ irs spectra of the gbpne , we chose isolated objects in the iras point source catalog ( psc ) with small radial extent , accurate coordinates , and observable intensities . while the iras psc is not as sensitive as our spitzer observations ( the iras psc catalog is sensitive to a couple hundred mjy whereas our spitzer observations are sensitive to a few mjy ) , we check that only one source is on the slit during the data reduction .",
    "the criterion of selecting pne with small sizes also ensured that nearly all of the flux from most of the pne could be observed within sl , the smallest irs slit at 3.6across .",
    "the sources also were chosen to have coordinates known to better than 1.4  from the radio positions of @xcite , and these coordinates were refined with the 2mass catalog . finally , we chose objects with radio fluxes at 21 cm ( f@xmath7 ) that implied ir fluxes bright enough ( f@xmath8 @xmath6 10 mjy ) to allow for short integration times , but dim enough ( f@xmath8 @xmath9 50 mjy ) to not saturate any of the irs modules .",
    "table [ basicdata ] gives the iras fluxes at 12 and 25  as well as the radio fluxes at 21 cm for our objects .",
    "we start with basic calibrated data ( bcd ) from the _ spitzer science center s _ pipeline version s15.3 or s16.1 , and run it through the irsclean program to remove rogue pixels , which uses a mask of rogue pixels from the same campaign as the data .",
    "then we take the mean of repeated observations ( cycles ) to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "after that the background is subtracted using the off - source positions for sh and lh , and using the off - order for sl ( for example , sl1 nod1 - sl2 nod1 ) .",
    "next we use smart @xcite to manually extract the images , using full - slit extraction for sh and lh and variable - column extraction for sl ; we also inspect the spectral profiles of each target with the manual source finder tool in smart to ensure that only one source is within the slit .",
    "spikes due to deviant pixels which the irsclean program missed are removed manually in smart . in order to account for flux that fell outside of the irs slits ( due either to a slight mispointing and/or the extended size of the gbpne )",
    ", we apply multiplicative scaling factors to each order and nod .",
    "the highest flux in lh sets the scaling because lh is large enough to contain the entire flux of all of our gbpne .",
    "thus , one nod in lh is scaled to the other , the sh nods are then scaled to lh , and the sl nods and orders are then scaled to match sh .",
    "table [ scaling_factors ] gives the scaling factors ; they are usually quite small ( @xmath101.20 ) except for three pne where the scaling factors in sl ( the aperture with the smallest width ) reach up to 1.70 .",
    "figure [ silicates_oplot_cont ] plots the scaled and nod - averaged spectra .",
    "we predict the 12 and 25  iras fluxes from these scaled irs spectra and find generally good agreement with the actual iras fluxes , confirming that only the iras source is within the irs slit .",
    "finally we use the gaussian profile fitting routine in smart to measure line fluxes for each nod position of the scaled spectra .",
    "table [ ir_lines ] gives the observed nod - averaged line fluxes .",
    "uncertainties on the line fluxes are usually @xmath1010% , with uncertainties greater than this marked in the table .",
    "a less - than sign in table [ ir_lines ] indicates a 3@xmath11 upper limit obtained from the instrument resolution and the root mean square ( rms ) deviation in the spectrum at the wavelength of the line .",

    "however , regardless of which statistical distances we adopt , the conclusions of the paper will remain unchanged because all of the pne in our sample are constrained to be in the bulge by other criteria and we include the large uncertainties that go with these statistical distances in the data analysis .",

    "after that we use the values of the above quantities to obtain abundances for each ion .",
    "the following subsection discuss the details of the calculations of extinction , the selection of t@xmath27  and n@xmath27 , and finally the derivation of ionic and total abundances .",
    "we first calculate the reddening correction by comparing the h@xmath21 flux predicted from ir hydrogen recombination lines to the observed h@xmath21 flux ( see table [ compare_chbeta ] ) . in order to predict the h@xmath21 flux from the ir lines , we adopt the theoretical ratios of hydrogen recombination lines from @xcite and assume case b recombination for a gas at t@xmath27= 10@xmath28 k and n@xmath27= 10@xmath29 @xmath30 .",

    "additionally we calculate extinction by comparing the h@xmath21 flux predicted from the radio flux at 6 cm to the observed h@xmath21 flux .",
    "we assume that t@xmath27=@xmath31 k ( and thus t @xmath32 t@xmath27/@xmath31 k = 1 ) , he@xmath33/h@xmath33=0.09 , and he@xmath34/h@xmath33=0.03 and use the following formula from @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 converts units so that @xmath37 is in jy and f(h@xmath21 ) is in erg @xmath14 s@xmath15 .",
    "table [ basicdata ] gives the values for @xmath37 and f(h@xmath21 ) while table [ compare_chbeta ] gives the calculated values of the extinction .",
    "for the abundance calculations , in order to weight the extinctions calculated from both of the above methods equally , we use @xmath38 when we have extinctions from both lines and the radio , otherwise we just take an average ( see table [ adopted_param ] for these adopted values ) .",
    "there is no h@xmath21 flux available for png002.1 + 03.3 and thus we adopt an extinction to it from the average of the other gbpne extinctions .",
    "table [ compare_chbeta ] gives the extinction values derived here along with those from the literature .",
    "in general there is very good agreement between the different methods .",
    "we use the extinction law from @xcite and assume the standard @xmath39 of the milky way of 3.1 .",
    "however , there is evidence that interstellar extinction is steeper than this toward the bulge , e.g. @xcite find that @xmath39=2.3 and @xcite find @xmath39 = 2.0 .",
    "nevertheless , abundances determined from ir lines are not greatly affected by this change in @xmath39 : an @xmath39=2.0 usually changes their abundances by @xmath55% ( and at most 10% ) compared to the usual @xmath39=3.1 .",
    "thus , because the previous optical studies to which we compare assumed r@xmath40=3.1 , and because the ir lines are even less affected by the choice of r@xmath40 , we assume r@xmath40=3.1 .",

    "their images and model of this star imply that it has a c - rich bipolar outflow with an inner low - density c - rich region surrounded by an outer dense o - rich torus , indicating that mixed chemistry and morphology are related ; mixed chemistry may point to binary evolution .",
    "other evidence also suggests that many of our gbpne probably have binaries with silicate disks : ( 1 ) @xmath240% of compact pne in the bulge have binary - induced morphologies @xcite ; ( 2 ) binary - induced novae are observed to be concentrated in the bulge of the galaxy m31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus perhaps in the bulge of our galaxy as well ; ( 3 ) asymmetric ( e.g. bipolar , quadrupolar ) morphology is more common in pne in high metallicity environments than in low metallicity ones @xcite ; ( 4 ) the current study showing the similarity of the mean gbpne spectra to the mean disk spectra of @xcite (  [ crystalline_silicates_discussion ] ) ; and ( 5 ) the silicates are crystalline and not amorphous , indicating that they have been blasted over time and are likely stored in a disk @xcite .",
    "thus it seems likely that the gbpne in our sample with dual chemistry have a binary at their center with a silicate disk that formed long before the pn stage , while the pahs reside in the pn outflow itself , possibly shooting out along the poles .",
    "we extract the _ spitzer _ irs spectra of eleven pne in the bulge to study their abundances and dust properties .",
    "we conclude that :    * ( 1 ) * the abundances of argon , neon , sulfur , and oxygen are significantly lower in the pne in the bulge than the abundances for the bulge predicted by the abundance gradient in the disk , consistent with the idea that the bulge and disk evolved separately .    *",
    "( 2 ) * all of the spectra in our sample of pne in the bulge show crystalline silicates , indicating that these crystalline silicates are likely stored in disks , which would further imply that the progenitor stars of these pne evolved in binary systems .    * ( 3 ) * six of the eleven spectra of pne in the bulge in our sample show pahs in addition to the crystalline silicates .",
    "this dual chemistry also points toward binary evolution : the pahs are in the current pn outflow and the crystalline silicates reside in a old disk created by binary interaction .",

    "<S> abundances of argon and sulfur ( and in most cases neon and oxygen ) in planetary nebulae in the bulge give the abundances of the interstellar medium at the time their progenitor stars formed ; thus these abundances give information about the formation and evolution of the bulge . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances of bulge planetary nebulae tend to be slightly higher than those in the disk on average , but they do not follow the trend of the disk planetary nebulae , thus confirming the difference between bulge and disk evolution . additionally , the bulge planetary nebulae show peculiar dust properties compared to the disk nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen - rich dust feature ( crystalline silicates ) dominate the spectra of all of the bulge planetary nebulae ; such features are more scarce in disk nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , carbon - rich dust features ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) appear in roughly half of the bulge planetary nebulae in our sample , which is interesting in light of the fact that this dual chemistry is comparatively rare in the milky way as a whole . </S>"
