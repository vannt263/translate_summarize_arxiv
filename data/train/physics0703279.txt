    "the procedure is briefly explained as follows : when one knows complex transmissivity and reflectivity ( called @xmath0 parameters ) for a finitely thick object , one can numerically calculate ( or retrieves ) the effective permittivity and permeability by substituting the @xmath0 parameters into the transmission and reflection formulas , which hold for a finitely thick material of effective optical constants .",
    "the way was first introduced in 2002 @xcite and has been called retrieval way .    the retrieval way is algorithmic and not rigorous compared with the effective media description , which has been studied over one century @xcite since maxwell - garnet @xcite .",

    "those metamaterials exhibit novel optical states , which are exceptions to the statement that permeability is unity at optical frequencies @xcite .    a simple theoretical analysis presented a possibility of super - resolution by a thin metal film @xcite and the sub - diffraction - limited image was shown experimentally @xcite .",
