    "there is great interest in ferroelectric / multiferroic materials nowadays due to their potential application in a plethora of subjects , ranging from high density memories to magnetoelectric sensors .",
    "the complexity of electronic phenomena at the nanoscale makes them a hot research topic and a fertile ground for new experimental techniques , which are able to probe point - like , atomic - scale properties . to this aim ,",
    "the use of local probes as in hyperfine interactions techniques , such as mssbauer effect spectroscopy , perturbed angular correlation ( pac ) spectroscopy , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) , give access to atomic scale information of the electronic charge density  @xcite through the measure of the electric field gradients ( efgs ) , thus probing the phenomenology of materials at the nanoscale .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", advances in modern density functional theory have made the calculation of the spontaneous electric polarization @xmath1 a routine calculation in an _ ab initio _ framework .",
    "@xcite recently , the calculation of efgs has become also possible from first - principles .",
    "@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , a theoretical study based on _ ab - initio _ density functional methods aiming to investigate both the @xmath1 and efgs in a ferroelectric material is still missing in the current literature despite the fact that a linear correlation  @xcite between @xmath1 and efg values at a given site was shown a long time ago . this `` correlation '' would suggest that information obtained through the measurements of efg tensors can provide indirect access to the polarization as well . if true , one could study a macroscopic property of the crystal , such as @xmath1 by using local probes . in this work ,",
    "we want to explore such a possibility .",
    "a nucleus with a nonspherical nuclear charge distribution possesses an electric quadrupole moment which leads to a hyperfine splitting for a nuclear spin @xmath2 if subjected to an efg .",
    "the hyperfine techniques previously mentioned can measure the quadrupole coupling constant , which is the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the efg .",
    "the efg , in turn , arises due to the coulomb potential at the nucleus , and its measurement is sensitive to the surrounding electronic charge density .",
    "more precisely , it is defined as the symmetric traceless second - rank tensor of second derivatives of the coulomb potential with respect to the spatial coordinates , @xmath3 , at the nuclear position . in the principal axis",
    "coordinate system , the tensor is diagonal and its elements are usually ordered by the convention @xmath4 . usually @xmath5 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath6 are used in the analysis of measurements .",
    "we recall that the efg is site dependent , and its principal axes ( @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9 ) may not be the same at every site , although they are usually along symmetry axes of the crystal .",
    "efg studies are found in various types of materials , for example , intermetallics ,  @xcite metal complexes ,  @xcite magnetic ,  @xcite or multiferroic compounds .",
    "@xcite    previous studies have shown that in some ferroelectric materials @xmath1 follows a temperature dependence which can be related to the efg at specific atomic sites .",
    "for instance , nmr using @xmath10na in rochelle salts [ nak(tartrate)@xmath114h@xmath12o ] showed that @xmath1 and the efg are linearly related .",
    "@xcite in 1978 yeshurun suggested  @xcite that the efg due to static displacements should be proportional to @xmath13 in perovskite crystals using an empirical model for interpreting previous @xmath14fe mssbauer measurements in batio@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite dynamical aspects were also considered by relating the efg to the electric susceptibility , and it was found that the efg should have a critical behavior when approaching @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite this peculiar feature was recently used in the identification of ferroelectricity with efg measurements .",
    "@xcite in this work , pr@xmath16ca@xmath17mno@xmath0 was studied with the measurement of the efg at @xmath18cd probes implanted into the sample .",
    "an abrupt change was found in a short temperature interval .",
    "this was associated to the onset of ferroelectricity , since the efg should be dominated by a contribution proportional to the electric susceptibility at the transition , i.e. , with its critical behavior .",
    "@xcite in the same work ,  @xcite it was also suggested that the temperature dependence of efg tensors can give information on the onset of charge or orbital ordering . in ref .",
    "it was argued that the static part of @xmath5 should have the following behavior with respect to @xmath1 : either it is proportional to @xmath13 in sites which have inversion symmetry in the paraelectric structure , or it is proportional to @xmath1 , like in rochelle salts .",
    "the quadratic relation was supported by experiments in nano@xmath12 ,  @xcite in pbhfo@xmath0 not too close to @xmath15 ( where critical behavior is found ) , by pac measurements ,  @xcite and by nmr measurements in batio@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite it is therefore clear from the current literature that @xmath1 and the efg tensor are closely related quantities .",
    "our study aims to explore this relationship by calculating both @xmath1 and efg for simple ferroelectric materials and studying a possible correlation between these quantities .",
    "some of the previously mentioned results are obtained by impurity probes in the host materials . here",
    ", we shall limit our studies to systems where the probes are natural constituents of the materials .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ computdetails ] we discuss the computational details . in sec .",
    "[ p_and_efg ] we present the results and discuss the relationship between @xmath1 and efgs for simple tetragonal or orthorhombic ( sec .  [ orthorhombic ] ) systems .",
    "we analyze the possible linear correlations between efg tensor components in sec .",
    "[ czjzek ] .",
    "a study of the variation of @xmath19 with the atomic numbers of different materials is shown in section  [ arelation ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we have considered a series of simple @xmath20o@xmath21 type perovskite compounds .",
    "@xcite for batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 and knbo@xmath0 we have considered the tetragonal experimental structures as references . we also considered other perovskite - related compounds , such as bazro@xmath0 , catio@xmath0 , pbzro@xmath0 , srtio@xmath0 , nanbo@xmath0 and linbo@xmath0 by considering a pseudo - cubic phase at the experimental lattice constants of the cubic paraelectric phase .",
    "the ferroelectric distortion was mimicked by a polar displacement of the atoms .",
    "the experimental displacements in tetragonal batio@xmath0 are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , in fractional coordinates .",
    "@xcite we calculate the efg as a function of @xmath25 , which represents the fraction of the displacements ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) mentioned above",
    ". therefore @xmath29 corresponds to the equilibrium ( experimental ) structure .",
    "values of @xmath30 are used , i.e. , @xmath31 corresponds to undistorted , @xmath32 corresponds to the experimental equilibrium distortion ( at 280 k ) and @xmath33 corresponds to 20% additional distortion . for the compounds where the cubic structure is used , a ferroelectric state is considered using the same fractional distortions as in batio@xmath0 .",
    "although these states may not be observed in normal conditions , this allows us to study the possible correlation of polarization and efg in different systems or as a function of strain .",
    ".[tab : latt ] lattice constants ( in  ) and atomic distortions used in the calculations of the perovskite compounds .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 correspond to the fractional distortions in the @xmath38 direction , with respect to the ideal positions , of the inequivalent sites .",
    "sites @xmath39 are at the corners of the unit cell , @xmath40 is the transition metal inside an octahedron formed by apical o1 and equatorial o2 oxygen atoms . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lengths are markedly larger for pbtio@xmath0 , knbo@xmath0 , linbo@xmath0 , and nanbo@xmath0 . the cases of pbtio@xmath0 and knbo@xmath0 correspond to different fractional distortions in comparison to the other cases . however , all the other cases have fractional distortions equal to batio@xmath0 . in this respect , it is interesting to remark that both niobates ( linbo@xmath0 and nanbo@xmath0 ) have trajectories with approximately twice the length of the others , indicating that the local charge at the o2 atoms is more sensitive to displacements when nb is the @xmath40 site .    from these plots",
    "it is also of interest to determine the `` asymptotic '' asymmetry parameter ( @xmath41 ) ,  @xcite related to the slope of the trajectories after reflections at the boundaries , corresponding to the limiting value of @xmath42 for a given trajectory .",
    "these values are presented in table  [ lengths ] .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath41 is large in most cases , with a smaller value for pbtio@xmath0 .",
    "it should be related to the different features of the distortion , due to the fact that this compound has ferroelectricity driven by the lone pair of @xmath43 electrons at the pb ions , while ferroelectricity in other compounds is related to the @xmath44 configuration at the @xmath40 site .",
    "if the trajectories in this plot are straight lines , this shows that the efg tensor components are linearly related .",
    "this is usually the case , except for linbo@xmath0 and nanbo@xmath0 , where the trajectory is approximately straight for low values of @xmath1 , but becomes curved for higher values .",
    "the linearity in almost all cases means that the whole tensor , when considering the distortions that give rise to ferroelectric polarization , can be described by a _",
    "this might have important implications on the way experimental data should be analyzed , since the components are not independent , and the combination of all information will be more useful than each of them taken separately .",
    "the study of the efg dependence on temperature ( or on other variables ) usually done by separating @xmath5 and @xmath42 , can be performed by identifying the global single parameter .",
    "in the following we analyze the relations found in different materials .",
    "the quadratic coefficients @xmath45 in the @xmath19 expression follow an interesting trend with atomic number at the @xmath39 sites ( @xmath46 ) , shown in fig .",
    "figures  [ a_za1 ] and  [ a_za2 ] show @xmath5 at the @xmath39 site for the different cubic and tetragonal compounds .",
    "pbtio@xmath0 introduces larger variations for @xmath13 and @xmath5 which may follow from the larger displacements in the experimental distortion , related , as previously discussed , to the different nature of the ferroelectricity .",
    "@xmath5 is @xmath47 for the paraelectric cubic cases , while for the paraelectric tetragonal structures v@xmath48 has small nonzero values , except pbtio@xmath0 .",
    "the slopes of the trajectories correspond to the coefficients of the quadratic term , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ a_za3 ] .",
    "the @xmath39 sites with a larger number of electrons show a larger magnitude of @xmath45 , that follows a quadratic dependence on @xmath46 .",
    "there are two pairs of compounds with the same @xmath46 , but different metal @xmath40 sites , namely batio@xmath0/bazro@xmath0 , and pbtio@xmath0/pbzro@xmath0 .",
    "the same trend is still qualitatively followed although small changes in the values of the coefficient are seen , and the changes do not follow a pattern : @xmath45 is higher for @xmath49ti than @xmath49pb in the cases with @xmath50ba , but the opposite happens when @xmath50pb .",
    "we did not find other trends for the other coefficients , or for @xmath51 , as a function of the atomic number of the different sites .",
    "in summary , our calculations provide an _ ab initio _ support for previous observations of a quadratic dependence of the efg tensor versus @xmath1 in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite structure and other distorted structures . an exception to this rule",
    "is only seen in pbtio@xmath0 , at the pb and equatorial o sites , and in catio@xmath0 at the equatorial sites , where an additional quartic term dependence is observed . moreover , for most cases the local symmetry of the atom means that the efg tensor is axially symmetric and all the components are trivially related to each other . for the equatorial oxygen atoms this is not the case .",
    "nevertheless , the components of the efg tensor are also quadratically related to @xmath1 and there is a linear correlation among efg tensor components for most cases .",
    "the relation between @xmath1 and efgs follows a trend with the atomic number of the @xmath39 site , qualitatively a quadratic variation .",
    "the efg , working as a local analog of @xmath1 , has the added advantage of higher spatial resolution and short time scales , which allows local probing of nanoscale phenomena at specific lattice sites .",
    "the different types of lattice sites , including defects , can be discriminated by their different efgs .",
    "its critical behavior in phase transitions may be analyzed , and the order of the transitions can be established with a high degree of detail . in hysteresis loops , it can act as a static measurement of the electric polarization in individual domains , not limited by depolarization effects and is much more sensitive to polarization reversal . it is also suited to probe phase coexistence or inhomogeneous polarization states with atomic selectivity , well beyond the reach of conventional polarization measurements .",
    "moreover , piezoelectric force microscopy is usually restricted to studies near the surface of samples , while efg studies can be performed in bulk or at the surface of materials , by using diffusion , evaporation or implantation techniques to add the probe atoms in the environments to study .",
    "therefore , we hope this work will stimulate more efg studies .",
    "however , one limitation of our results should be mentioned . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the variation of the efg with the scaling of the ferroelectric distortions as a whole .",
    "however , in experiments , the parameters , such as temperature , in general produce variations involving , for example , additional distortion modes , lattice vibrations , and lattice expansions .",
    "the variation of each independent atomic displacement may have a complex variation with changing temperature .",
    "therefore , the relation investigated here can not be directly used to infer polarization variations from efgs or vice - versa , except in well understood cases .",
    "further work to improve this limitation could involve the study of different structural changes or temperature effects .",
