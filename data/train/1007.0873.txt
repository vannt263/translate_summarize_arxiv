    "self - consistent mean - field calculations using effective interactions have been very successful in describing the properties and the dynamics of a wide range of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "one of the most popular effective interactions are zero - range interactions of the skyrme type because of the fast numerical computations which can thus be performed  @xcite .",
    "even though negele and vautherin  @xcite showed a long time ago how to obtain effective interactions using nuclear many - body methods , a more empirical approach has been usually followed .",
    "a specific parametric form of the effective interaction is postulated and the unknown parameters are determined _ a posteriori _ so as to reproduce a set of nuclear data selected according to a specific purpose .",
    "the non - uniqueness of the fitting procedure has thus lead to a large number of different parametrizations .",
    "some of them may yield very different predictions when applied outside the domain where they were fitted  @xcite .",
    "this situation is particularly unsatisfactory for nuclear astrophysical applications which require the knowledge of nuclear masses for nuclei so neutron rich that there is no hope of measuring them in the foreseeable future ; such nuclei play a vital role in the r - process of nucleosynthesis  @xcite and are also found in the outer crust of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "extrapolations far beyond the neutron drip line are required for the description of the inner crust of neutron stars where nuclear clusters are embedded in a sea of superfluid neutrons  @xcite .",
    "such environments can not be reproduced in the laboratory .",
    "however many astrophysical phenomena observed in neutron stars are precisely related to the physics of these outer layers  @xcite .",
    "the need for more reliable extrapolations of these nuclear models has motivated recent efforts to construct non - empirical effective interactions and more generally microscopic nuclear energy density functionals  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately such _ ab initio _ nuclear energy density functionals able to reproduce existing experimental nuclear data with the same degree of accuracy as phenomenological interactions are not yet available .    for the time being , a reasonable approach is to fit these phenomenological interactions with as many available nuclear data as possible , not only from experiments but also from realistic calculations in infinite homogeneous nuclear matter .",
    "very accurate nuclear mass models based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method with zero- and finite - range effective forces have thus been recently developed  @xcite .",
    "in particular in our model hfb-17  @xcite , we have achieved our best fit ever to essentially all the available experimental mass data , the rms deviation for the set of 2149 measured masses of nuclei with @xmath0 and @xmath1 8  @xcite being only 0.581 mev .",
    "significant improvements compared to our previous models have been made possible by a better treatment of pairing correlations first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended in ref .",
    "@xcite . the effective interaction used in the pairing channel",
    "was constrained to reproduce the @xmath2 pairing gaps as obtained by microscopic calculations using realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "we have recently applied these effective forces to study the properties of the neutron superfluid phase in the inner crust of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the effective pairing interaction associated with our nuclear mass models requires the evaluation of one dimensional integrals .",
    "although its numerical implementation is straightforward , using such interaction could become computationally costly for large scale calculations such as the determination of fission barriers . in this paper , a more tractable expression of the pairing interaction is presented by calculating the underlying integrals analytically .",
    "we will consider effective interactions of the skyrme type in the particle - hole channel .",
    "but results can be easily generalized to other kinds of interactions .",
    "the pairing interaction that we consider here acts only between nucleons of the same charge state @xmath3 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 for neutron or proton respectively ) and is given by @xmath6~\\delta(\\pmb{r_{ij}})\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the two - body spin - exchange operator , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . due to the zero range of this interaction , a cutoff has to be introduced in the gap equations in order to avoid divergences ( for a review of the various prescriptions , see for instance ref .",

    "it is generally assumed that @xmath13 $ ] depends only on the isoscalar density @xmath14 and is often parametrized as  @xcite @xmath15 = v_{\\pi q}^\\lambda\\left(1-\\eta_q \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0}\\right)^{\\alpha_q}\\right ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the nuclear saturation density while @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are adjustable parameters .",
    "the superscript @xmath20 on @xmath17 is to remind that the pairing strength depends very strongly on the cutoff used in the gap equations ( in principle changing the cutoff modifies also the other parameters but the effects are usually found to be small ) .",
    "effective interactions with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) have been traditionally refered as volume ( surface ) pairing .",
    "the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) are usually fitted directly to experimental data .",
    "the standard prescription is to adjust the value of the pairing strength @xmath17 to the average gap in @xmath23sn  @xcite .",
    "however this does not allow an unambiguous determination of the remaining parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "systematic studies of nuclei seem to favor a so - called mixed pairing with @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "even though such forces have been widely applied in nuclear structure calculations with some success , they lack a direct connection with realistic nucleon - nucleon forces .",
    "the reliability of these forces far beyond the domain where they were fitted is therefore not guaranteed .",
    "in particular pairing forces fitted only to finite nuclei generally yield unrealistic pairing gaps in infinite nuclear matter  @xcite , thus rendering their application to neutron - star crusts unreliable .",

    "@xcite who introduced an isospin dependence in the pairing strength in order to reproduce the @xmath2 pairing gaps in both symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter as obtained from brueckner calculations  @xcite .",
    "this approach assumes that the pairing _ interaction _ between two nucleons inside a nucleus is locally the same as the pairing interaction between two nucleons in infinite uniform matter .",
    "this should not be confused with the so - called `` local density approximation '' which supposes that the pairing _ field _",
    "@xmath26 appearing in the hfb equations ( see for instance appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is locally the same in finite nuclei and in infinite nuclear matter .",
    "even though the coupling to surface vibrations is expected to contribute to pairing  @xcite , a local pairing theory seems a reasonable first step  @xcite .",
    "finite size effects can be subsequently taken into account by introducing density gradient terms in the expression of the effective pairing force as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite in the general framework of the density functional theory .",
    "effective pairing forces with density gradients have been implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the drawback of using a phenomenological pairing force in order to fit microscopic pairing gaps in infinite uniform matter is that the functional form of the associated pairing strength is not _ a priori _ known . in particular different pairing gaps require different expressions of @xmath13 $ ] which can hardly be guessed due to the highly non - linear character of pairing correlations  @xcite .",
    "it should also be remarked that the parameters of the pairing force depend on the effective interaction used in the particle - hole channel since effective masses appear in the gap equations .",
    "fitting the parameters of the effective interaction to essentially all experimental nuclear masses both in the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels while simultaneously reproducing microscopic pairing gaps in infinite uniform matter would thus be an extremely onerous numerical task .",
    "actually as shown in refs .",

    "( [ eq.3 ] ) instead of a phenomenological expression such as eq  ( [ eq.2 ] ) guarantees that in infinite uniform matter the microscopic pairing gaps @xmath39 will be exactly reproduced .",
    "it also ensures that the pairing strength is suitably renormalized for any change in the energy cutoff .",
    "the price to be paid is the evaluation of the one dimensional integral , eq  ( [ eq.4 ] ) , for the neutron density @xmath40 and proton density @xmath41 at all points inside the nucleus . the computational cost becomes significant in fully self - consistent 2d and 3d calculations  @xcite .",
    "however we will now show that these numerical integrations can be avoided by making use of the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) is all the more peaked around @xmath42 as @xmath43 is small compared to @xmath44 .",
