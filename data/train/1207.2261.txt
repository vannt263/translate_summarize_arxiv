    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) play important roles in astrophysics as a standard candle for measuring cosmological distances and as main production sites of iron group elements .",
    "it is commonly agreed that the exploding star is a mass - accreting carbon - oxygen ( c+o ) white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "however , it is not clarified yet whether the wd accretes h / he - rich matter from its binary companion [ single degenerate ( sd ) scenario ] , or two c+o wds merge [ double degenerate ( dd ) scenario ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations have provided the following constraints on the nature of companion stars .",
    "some evidences support the sd model , such as the presence of circumstellar matter ( csm ) @xcite and detections of hydrogen in the circumstellar - interaction type sne  ( ia / iin ) like sn  2002ic @xcite and ptf11kx @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been no direct indication of the presence of companions , e.g. , ( 1 ) the lack of companion stars in the images of sn  2011fe @xcite , some sn ia remnants ( snrs ) @xcite , sn 1572 ( tycho ) @xcite and sn 1006 @xcite , ( 2 ) the lack of ultraviolet ( uv ) excesses of early - time light curves @xcite , and ( 3 ) the lack of hydrogen features in the spectra @xcite .",
    "both ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are expected from the collision between ejecta and a companion .",
    "in particular , detailed observations of sn  2011fe in m101 require stringent constraints on the progenitor , i.e. , @xcite excluded the presence of a red - giant ( rg ) , a helium star , or a main - sequence ( ms ) star of @xmath3 . @xcite",
    "further excluded a solar mass ms companion from an early uv observation with _ swift _ because of no signature of shock interaction between ejecta and a companion .",
    "the tightest constraints come from no signature of shock interaction with the companion",
    ". however , if the binary separation , @xmath4 , is much larger than the companion radius , @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 , the solid angle subtended by the companion would be much smaller , and so would be the effect of shock interaction . in their spin - down scenario ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the donor star in the sd model might shrink rapidly before the wd explosion , because it exhausts its hydrogen - rich envelope before the sn  ia explosion during a long spin - down phase of the rapidly rotating , super - chandrasekhar mass wd .",
    "in such a case , the companion star is much smaller than its roche lobe , which reduces the shock signature .",
    "this also explains the lack of hydrogen in the spectra of sne  ia and possibly the unseen companion in the snr @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented possible evolutionary routes to super - chandrasekhar mass wds in the wd+ms channel of the sd model .",
    "they also compared the spin - down time of wds with the companion star s ms lifetime and discussed their final states at explosions , although their main - focus was to explain the observed extremely luminous sne ia .    in this letter , we apply our method in @xcite to wd+rg binaries , and calculate the wd mass distribution beyond the chandrasekhar mass limit for both the wd+ms and wd+rg systems .",
    "we then estimate the brightness distribution of sne  ia , assuming that the brightness depends on the wd mass .",
    "we further confirm that , in most of the wd+rg systems , the companion has evolved off from a rg to a helium ( or c+o ) wd before the sn  ia explosion and such a compact companion does not show any prominent shock signatures nor indications of hydrogen . in section [ binary_evolution ]",
    ", we describe our basic assumptions and methods .",
    "section [ numerical_results ] presents our numerical results .",
    "section [ discussion ] discusses various perspectives on the progenitors of sne  ia .",
    "based on the sd model , we followed binary evolutions in which a wd accretes hydrogen - rich matter from its companion .",
    "there are two well studied evolutionary paths to sne  ia , the wd+ms and wd+rg channels .",
    "our basic assumptions in binary evolutions are essentially the same as those in @xcite .",
    "mass - accreting wds blow optically thick winds if the mass transfer rate exceeds the critical rate , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the wd winds collide with the secondary s surface and strip off its surface layer .",
    "if the mass - stripping is efficient enough , the mass transfer rate is attenuated and the binary avoid the formation of a common envelope even for a rather massive secondary of @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "thus , the mass - stripping effect widens the donor mass range of sn  ia progenitors .",
    "we have incorporated the mass - stripping effect in the same way as in @xcite , i.e. , the mass stripping rate @xmath10 is proportional to the wind mass - loss rate @xmath11 as @xmath12 . in this study , we assume @xmath13 as a lower representative value for the wd+ms system , because @xcite found that @xmath14 is between a few to 10 to reproduce the optical and x - ray light curve behaviors of some supersoft x - ray sources . if we adopt a larger value , we could have a more massive secondary . for the wd+rg systems , @xmath14 is calculated from equation ( 21 ) of @xcite .",
    "mass - accreting wds spin up because of angular momentum gain from the accreted matter @xcite .",
    "if the wd rotates rigidly , its mass can only slightly exceed the chandrasekhar mass of no rotation , @xmath15 with electron mole number @xmath16 . if the wd rotates differentially , however , its mass can significantly exceed @xmath17 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that the wd increases its mass beyond @xmath17 when the accretion rate to the wd is as high as @xmath18  yr@xmath19 .",
    "they showed that the gradient of angular velocity is kept around the critical value for the dynamical shear instability and that this differential rotation law is strong enough to support wds whose masses significantly exceed @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that highly differential rotation may not be realized due to baroclinic instability .",
    "however , his stability condition is not a sufficient condition but just a necessary condition for instability , so that his conclusion is premature ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    in the present study",
    ", we simply assume that mass - accreting wds are supported by the above differential rotation law and the mass can increase without carbon being fused at the center as long as @xmath20  yr@xmath21 .",
    "we assume that , when @xmath22 , hydrogen shell - burning occurs intermittently on the wd and the resultant nova outbursts eject a large part of the envelope mass @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the net growth rate of the wd mass is significantly reduced ( @xmath23  yr@xmath19 ) .",
    "then the timescale of angular momentum deposition to the wd core would become much longer than @xmath24  yr and comparable to the timescale for the eddington - sweet meridional circulation ( @xmath25  yr ) to redistribute angular momentum . this redistribution causes a contraction of the wd core and its central density increases high enough to trigger an sn  ia explosion before the wd mass significantly increases .",
    "thus , if the wd mass increases beyond @xmath26 , we define the wd mass at the sn  ia explosion as the wd mass when the mass transfer rate drops to @xmath27 .",

    "we plot results for four initial wd masses of @xmath30 , 1.0 , 0.9 , and @xmath31 because ( 1 ) no c+o wds of @xmath32 are expected for normal metallicity @xcite and ( 2 ) the @xmath33 region is too small for the wd+ms systems and none for the wd+rg systems .",
    "the wds inside these sn  ia regions ( labeled `` initial '' ) will increase their masses from ( a )  @xmath34 , ( b )  1.0 , ( c )  0.9 , and ( d )  0.8 @xmath35 to @xmath36 , 1.5 , 1.6 , ... , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 step from outside to inside contours ) and reach the regions labeled `` final . ''",
    "we stop the binary evolution when the mass transfer rate decreases to @xmath39 .",
    "both the wd+ms and wd+rg systems can produce a super - chandrasekhar mass wd up to @xmath40 .",
    "the sn  ia regions for different initial wd masses , @xmath41 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , and @xmath42 are calculated both for the wd+ms and wd+rg systems .",
    "we then estimate the sn  ia birth rate in our galaxy as @xmath43  yr@xmath19 and @xmath44  yr@xmath19 for the constant star formation rate . here",
    "we assume the initial distribution of binaries given by equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath45 and the distribution of mass ratio @xmath46 .",
    "we also estimate the delay time distribution ( dtd ) of sne  ia as shown in figure [ wd_mass_distribution_c3]a , where the delay time ( @xmath47 ) is the elapsed time from binary birth to explosion .",
    "the spin - down time of wds is not included .",
    "the computational method is the same as that in @xcite .",
    "these values are normalized to fit the dtd at 11 gyr @xcite .",
    "our dtd shows a featureless power law ( @xmath48 ) from 0.1 to 12 gyr , which is consistent with totani et al.s ( 2008 ) observation .",
    "the present results are essentially the same as our previous results by @xcite in which we assume that the wd explodes as an sn  ia at @xmath49 . in general , the wd+ms systems consist of a young population of sne  ia corresponding to short delay times ( @xmath50  gyr ) and the wd+rg systems an old population of long delay times ( @xmath51 gyr ) .",
    "we further calculate the distribution of the wd masses at sn  ia explosions as in table [ wd_mass_distribution_sup_ch ] and in figure [ wd_mass_distribution_c3]b  d .",
    "we also plot the number ratio of the wds for the wd+rg systems with the initial companion masses of @xmath52 , which are expected to occur in elliptical galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that the wd mass distribution in ellipticals is confined into a narrower range of 1.381.6@xmath53 than in late type galaxies .",
    "after the mass transfer rate drops to @xmath39 , the wd stops growing in mass .",
    "there are three characteristic mass ranges for the final evolution of wds toward an sn  ia explosion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detail ) .",
    "\\(1 ) in the extremely massive case , the differentially rotating wd explodes as an sn  ia soon after the wd mass exceeds @xmath54 owing to a secular instability .",
    "this is not the present case , because it happens for @xmath55 in only low metallicity environments .",
    "\\(2 ) for the mid - mass range of @xmath56@xmath54 , the wd is differentially rotating and its mass exceeds the maximum mass for rigid rotation . as angular momentum in the wd core is lost or redistributed toward rigid rotation , the wd core contracts until its central density and temperature become high enough to ignite carbon .",
    "thus the timescale of contraction until the sn explosion is @xmath57 yr due to angular momentum transport by the eddington - sweet meridional circulation .    as for the other angular momentum transport mechanisms , @xcite showed that magneto - dipole radiation leads to spin - down in a typical timescale of @xmath25@xmath58  yr for @xmath59 when the magnetic field of the wd is as weak as @xmath60  g. they also showed that the @xmath61-mode instability is not significant in spinning - down wds .",
    "thus , we here assume that the eddington - sweet meridional circulation is the most effective process for spin - down .",
    "\\(3 ) for the lower mass range of @xmath36@xmath62 , the wd can be supported by rigid rotation while it exceeds the critical mass of non - rotating wds for carbon ignition .",
    "thus , the wd contracts with the spin - down timescale , which is determined by angular momentum loss from the wd and thus depends on the strength of the magnetic field of the wd .",
    "the final fate of the wd depends on the spin - down time as we discuss below .",
    "it may take more than @xmath63  yr for weak magnetic fields of @xmath60  g @xcite .",
    "if the spin - down time is not much longer than @xmath63  yr , the compressional heating due to the spin - down would dominate the radiative cooling of the wd ( see equation ( 7 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "because the spin - down time is not unique , its variation causes a variety of thermal state of wd cores when carbon ignites at the center .",
    "this would lead to a variation of the carbon ignition density and thus a variation of @xmath64ni mass and brightness of sne  ia even for the same wd mass .",
    "if the spin - down time is much longer than @xmath65  yr , on the other hand , the central density at the carbon ignition could become high enough to induce collapse @xcite .",
    "this collapse produces a quite little amount of @xmath64ni as @xmath66 @xcite , which might correspond to a faint transient .      in most of the wd+ms systems ,",
    "the companion remains to be an ms ( central hydrogen burning ) star until the `` final '' stage of evolution .",
    "as shown in figures [ zregevl_10_11_strip_ms_rg_sc15_2012 ] and [ zregevl_08_09_strip_ms_rg_sc15_2012 ] , these systems have an orbital period shorter than @xmath67 day and a companion mass smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "this type of pre - supernova binaries satisfy the constraint on sn  2011fe posed by @xcite , @xmath68 .    if @xmath56@xmath54 and the spin - down time ( @xmath25  yr ) is shorter than the ms lifetime of the companion , the wd explodes before the companion evolves off the main - sequence . in most of these cases ,",
    "the companion s mass further satisfies the condition of @xmath69 posed by @xcite on the snr  2011fe , because the companion s mass further decreases from the `` final '' mass in figures [ zregevl_10_11_strip_ms_rg_sc15_2012 ] and [ zregevl_08_09_strip_ms_rg_sc15_2012 ] by the amount of roughly @xmath70  yr@xmath71  yr@xmath72 , which is transferred to the wd and ejected by nova outbursts . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath36@xmath62 and the spin - down time ( @xmath63  yr ) is longer than the ms lifetime of the companion , the companion becomes a helium wd and csm has disappeared .",
    "such a case might correspond to the case of no csm like sn 2011fe @xcite .    as already discussed in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the mass - stripping effect produces a large amount of csm , say , a few to several solar masses ( @xmath73 initial mass minus final mass , as seen in figures [ zregevl_10_11_strip_ms_rg_sc15_2012 ] and [ zregevl_08_09_strip_ms_rg_sc15_2012 ] ) . if the spin - down time is short enough , or if the wd is forced to be rigidly rotating during accretion due to strong magnetic fields , the wd may explode in the csm",
    ". then we may observe the interaction between the ejecta and the csm like in sne  ia / iin .      in the wd+rg systems ,",
    "after the mass transfer rate drops to @xmath39 , the companion rg further evolves and finally becomes a helium ( or c+o ) wd in a timescale of @xmath74  yr .",
    "this timescale is shorter than the spin - down time in both the mid - mass range ( @xmath75 : @xmath25  yr for the eddington - sweet circulation ) and lower mass range ( @xmath76 : @xmath63  yr for the magneto - dipole radiation ) wds .",
    "the companion rg has already evolved to a wd when the primary wd explodes as an sn  ia .",
    "therefore , the immediate progenitor is a wide binary consisting of wd+wd for all the cases .",
    "these immediate progenitors satisfy all the constraints mentioned in section [ intro ]",
    ". it might correspond to sn  2011fe , which shows no csm .",
    "it also explains the lack of hydrogen in the spectra of sne  ia and possibly the unseen companions of sn  1572 ( tycho ) @xcite , sn  1006 @xcite , and snr  0509 - 67.5 @xcite .    in the above discussion",
    ", we assumed that the spin - down time is @xmath77@xmath58  yr .",
    "however , if the spin - down time is short enough , or if the wd is forced to be rigidly rotating during accretion , the wd may explode before the companion evolves off the red - giant or asymptotic giant branch",
    ". then we may observe the interaction between the ejecta and the csm like in kepler s snr @xcite and in ptf11kx @xcite .      in our progenitor models , various types of sne",
    "ia can be explained as follows : normal sne  ia correspond to the lower mass range of wds , @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) .",
    "the brightness variation can be explained as a variety of spin - down time .",
    "the brighter group of sne  ia such as sn  1991 t correspond to the mid - mass range of wds , @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) .",
    "we think that for these brighter sne  ia , the brightness variation stems mainly from a variation of wd mass . here",
    "we set the border between the normal and brighter sne at about @xmath62 .",
    "however , it depends on the timescale of the eddington - sweet circulation which may become longer near rigid rotation",
    ". therefore , this border could be as massive as @xmath82 .",
    "now we explain the luminosity distribution of sne  ia with our model . in the observation , peak brightnesses of sne",
    "ia depend monotonically on the @xmath83 , where @xmath83 is the @xmath84-magnitude decay from the maximum in 15 days .",
    "table [ wd_mass_vs_luminosity_sup_ch ] compares the wd mass distribution in our model with the observational @xmath83 distribution @xcite . for the brighter group of sne  ia ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath83 is in good agreement with the wd mass distribution .",
    "this may be a support for our theoretical expectation that the brightness of sne  ia is determined mainly by the wd mass because the thermal state is similar among various wd cores due to its relatively short spin - down time .",
    "for the fainter group of sne  ia ( @xmath85 ) , however , the brightness of sne  ia depends not only on the wd mass but also on the spin - down time as mentioned in the previous subsection .    to summarize , we examined the final fate of the two progenitor models of sne  ia , the wd+ms and wd+rg systems .",
    "a major part of the wd+ms systems reasonably satisfy the stringent constraints on sn  2011fe in m101 .",
    "most cases of the wd+rg systems satisfy even more stringent constraints on snr  0509 - 67.5 posed by @xcite .",
