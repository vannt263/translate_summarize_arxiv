    "the degree of linear polarization of sunlight scattered by an asteroid toward an observer depends on the phase - angle , namely the angle between the asteroid - sun and the asteroid - observer directions .",
    "the phase - polarization curves of all atmosphereless bodies of the solar system exhibit qualitatively similar trends , but their detailed features vary according to the specific properties ( including primarily the geometric albedo ) of individual surfaces . in the phase - angle range @xmath1 , asteroids exhibit the so - called branch of _ negative polarization _",
    ", in which , in contrast to what is expected from simple single rayleigh - scattering or fresnel - reflection mechanisms , the plane of linear polarization turns out to be parallel to the plane of scattering ( the plane including the sun , the target and the observer ) .",
    "the plane of linear polarization becomes perpendicular to the scattering plane , a situation commonly described as _ positive polarization _",
    ", at phase angle values larger than the so - called _ inversion angle _ , which is generally around @xmath2 .",
    "a few years ago , @xcite discovered a class of asteroids exhibiting peculiar phase - polarization curves , characterized by a very unusual extent of the negative polarization branch , with an inversion angle around @xmath3 , much larger than the values commonly displayed by most objects . since the prototype of this class is the asteroid ( 234 ) barbara ,",
    "these objects have been since then commonly known as _",
    "barbarians_. only half a dozen barbarians are known today : ( 234 ) barbara , ( 172 ) baucis , ( 236 ) honoria , ( 387 ) aquitania , ( 679 ) pax , and ( 980 ) anacostia @xcite .",
    "the polarimetric properties of the barbarians are fairly unexpected .",
    "the observed large negative polarization branch is not predicted by theoretical models of light scattering , but in fairly special situations , including surfaces composed of very regularly - shaped particles ( spheres , crystals ) or surfaces having considerable microscopic optical inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "although barbarians are certainly uncommon , they do exist , and the interpretation of their polarization features may lead to important advances in our understanding of both light - scattering phenomena , and of the origin and evolution of these objects .",
    "potential explanations range from peculiar surface composition and/or texture , to the possible presence of anomalous properties at macroscopic scales due the presence of large concavities associated with big impact craters @xcite .",
    "for instance , ( 234 ) barbara has a very long rotation period , which might be the effect of a big collision .",
    "@xcite suggested that ( 234 ) barbara could have a surface characterised by large - scale craters .",
    "this is confirmed by an analysis of still unpublished occultation data by one of us ( pt ) .    in terms of taxonomy based on spectro - photometric data ,",
    "all known barbarians are classified as members of a few unusual classes , including @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and ( in only one case ) @xmath6 .",
    "( 234 ) barbara itself is an @xmath5 asteroid ( here we use the taxonomic classification of * ? ? ?",
    ". however , there are @xmath4-class asteroids which are  normal \" objects not exhibiting the barbarian properties .",
    "this fact seems to rule out a direct relationship between taxonomic class ( based on the reflectance spectrum ) and polarimetric properties . on the other hand , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 classes",
    "are located , in a principal component analysis plane , along adjacent locations , which although non - overlapping , seem to represent some kind of continuous spectral alteration surrounding the most common @xmath7 class complex .",
    "the fact that the six known barbarians identified so far belong all to one of these three classes suggests that surface composition could be responsible for their polarimetric properties .",
    "even more important , two @xmath4-class barbarians , ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 980 ) anacostia , exhibit very similar reflectance spectra , both sharing the rare property of displaying the spectral signature of the spinel mineral @xcite . actually , it was exactly the fact that ( 980 ) anacostia was found to be a barbarian that led @xcite to observe polarimetrically ( 387 ) aquitania , and to discover that also this object shares the same polarimetric behaviour .",
    "spinel ( [ fe , mg]al@xmath8o@xmath9 ) is a mineral characterized by indistinct cleavage and conchoidal , or uneven fracture properties . in terms of optical properties ,",
    "the mgal@xmath8o@xmath9 form of spinel has a fairly high refractive index ( @xmath10 ) , which becomes even higher in the spinel variety having a high iron content ( hercynite ) ( @xmath11 , i.e. , much above the values characterizing the most common silicates present on asteroid surfaces , * ? ? ?",
    "spinel is an important component of calcium aluminum - rich inclusions ( cai ) found in all kinds of chondritic meteorites .",
    "cais are refractory compounds which are thought to be among the first minerals to have condensed in the proto - solar nebula .",
    "they are the oldest samples of solid matter known in our solar system , and they are used to establish the epoch of its formation @xcite . in terms of spectroscopic properties ,",
    "spinel is characterized by the absence ( or extreme weakness ) of absorption bands around 1@xmath12 m , and by the presence of a strong absorption band at 2@xmath12 m .",
    "@xcite concluded that , to model the available near - ir spectra of spinel - rich asteroids , it is necessary to assume abundances of the order of up to 30% of cai material on the surface .",
    "this extreme abundance , which causes a high refractive index , might also be responsible for the anomalous polarization properties .",
    "such high cai abundances have never been found in meteorite on earth ( so far , the richest cai abundance , found on cv3 meteorites , is about 10% ) .",
    "therefore , @xcite conclude that spinel - rich asteroids  might be more ancient than any known sample in our meteorite collection , making them prime candidates for sample return \" missions .",
    "many interesting questions are certainly open . which processes are involved in the onset of physical mechanisms which produce the barbarian polarimetric behaviour ? are barbarians really among the oldest objects accreted in our solar system ?",
    "if so , why are they the only one class of primitive objects being characterized by an anomalous polarimetric behaviour ? why are they so rare ?",
    "are they unusually weak against collisions and fragmentation ?",
    "do space - weathering phenomena affect their polarimetric properties ?",
    "are the taxonomic classifications of some @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 objects possibly wrong ( in such a way that all barbarians might be member of a unique class and not spread among three of them ) ?",
    "it is clear that an important pre - requisite to improve our understanding of these objects , and to draw from them some possible inferences about the origin , composition and subsequent evolution of the planetesimals orbiting the sun at the epoch of planetary formation , is to find new members of the barbarian class , but where to look for them ?",
    "an aid to a barbarian search comes from the fact , recently confirmed by @xcite , that the spinel - bearing barbarian ( 980 ) anacostia belongs to a family of high - inclination asteroids .",
    "this family is named watsonia from its lowest - numbered member ( 729 ) watsonia .",
    "( 980 ) anacostia belongs to a small grouping which is included in the watsonia family and merges with it at larger values of mutual distances between the members . in other words , ( 980 )",
    "anacostia belongs to a distinct sub - group of the watsonia family , but the possible independence of this sub - group from the rest of the family is highly uncertain and questionable @xcite .",
    "another known barbarian , ( 387 ) aquitania , though not being a member of the watsonia family , is also located in close vicinity in the space of proper orbital elements ( see section[results ] ) . finally , a member of the watsonia family , asteroid ( 599 ) luisa , is not a known barbarian ( no published polarimetric measurements are available for it ) , but it is known to be one of the few spinel - rich asteroids identified so far ( thus sharing some common properties with both anacostia and aquitania ) .",
    "one should also note that the distribution of albedos of the members of the watsonia family observed at thermal ir wavelengths by the wise satellite @xcite is strongly peaked around values between @xmath13 and @xmath14 with only a few likely interlopers , suggesting that the family is not a statistical fluke web facility available at url http://mp3c.oca.eu/ ] .",
    "a possible common collisional origin of these asteroids opens new perspectives for the search of new barbarians and for the interpretation of their properties .",
    "asteroid families are the outcomes of fragmentation of single parent bodies disrupted by catastrophic collisions .",
    "therefore , if ( 980 ) anacostia , and possibly also ( 387 ) aquitania , were issued from the disruption of a common parent body exhibiting the rare properties which produce the barbarian polarization phenomenon , it would be natural to expect that also the other , still not observed members of the watsonia family should be found to be barbarians .",
    "moreover , among the watsonia family members at least one , ( 599 ) luisa , is a known spinel - rich asteroid , like anacostia and aquitania .",
    "finally , wise albedo values in the same range of those of watsonia family members have also been derived for most barbarian asteroids known so far , namely 234 , 172 , 236 , 679 and 980 .",

    "these objects are listed in table  [ tab_observations ] .",
    "we note that a more recent family search whose results are publicly available at the astdys web site also identified a watsonia family , but using a more conservative value of the critical level of mutual distances between family members to be adopted to define the family . as a consequence , the astdys version of the watsonia family has a smaller membership list , and does not include our target objects 42365 , 144854 , 247356 and 320971 .",
    "we observed our targets using the vlt fors2 instrument @xcite in imaging polarimetric mode , and obtained @xmath24 broadband linear polarization measurements in the @xmath25 special filter from april to september 2013 .",
    "the choice of an @xmath25 filter ( instead of the standard @xmath21 filter traditionally used in many asteroid polarimetric observations ) was dictated by the need of improving the s / n ratio .",
    "polarimetric measurements were performed with the retarder wave - plate at all positions between 0  and 157.5 , at 22.5  steps .",
    "for each observation , the exposure time cumulated over all exposures varied from 8min ( for 5492 ) to 1h and 20min ( for 320971 ) .",
    "data were then treated as explained in @xcite , and our measurements are reported adopting as a reference direction the perpendicular to the great circle passing through the object and the sun . this way , @xmath26 represents the flux perpendicular to the plane sun - object - earth ( the scattering plane ) minus the flux parallel to that plane , divided by the sum of these fluxes .",
    "it is therefore identical to the parameter indicated as @xmath27 in many asteroid polarimetric studies . in these conditions , for symmetry reasons , @xmath28 values are expected to be zero , and inspection of their values confirms that this is the case for our observations .    at small phase angles ( @xmath29 ) , all asteroids",
    "exhibit negative polarization , whereas at phase angles @xmath30 , nearly all asteroids exhibit positive polarization .",
    "by contrast , at phase angle @xmath31 , barbarians still exhibit a relatively strong negative polarization ( @xmath32% ) .",
    "therefore , to identify barbarians , we decided to measure the polarization at phase angles @xmath33 , and establish whether the measured polarization plane is found to be parallel or perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the results of our polarimetric measurements are given in table  [ tab_observations ] and shown in figure  [ figure1 ] , in which a comparison is also made with the phase - polarization curve of ( 234 ) barbara and ( 12 ) victoria , a big , non - barbarian @xmath4-class asteroid . in the figure each target is represented by a different symbol , and some targets have more than one measurement . in the observed phase - angle range ,",
    "seven of our targets show a polarization value @xmath32% , consistent with the value exhibited by ( 234 ) barbara .",
    "in fact , ( 234 ) barbara exhibits marginally higher polarization values ( in absolute value ) than our targets , possibly due to the different filter in which the observations were performed .",
    "the striking result of our observing campaign is that seven out of nine asteroids of our target list are barbarians .",
    "the two exceptions are 247356 and 320971 .",
    "however , we know _ a priori _ that all family member lists are expected to include some fraction of random interlopers @xcite , then we conclude that both non - barbarian objects in our target list may be family interlopers .",
    "for instance , asteroid 320971 is listed as a watsonian member by @xcite , but it is not included among the watsonia members identified in the new astdys list of asteroid families . on the other hand , three other targets not included in the astdys member list , but present in the @xcite member list , are found to be barbarians .",
    "we conclude therefore that , apart from some details concerning family membership , the watsonia family is an important repository of barbarian asteroids .",
    "this is the immediate and most important result of our investigation .",
    "we also note that the number of watsonia barbarians identified in our observing campaign is larger than the whole sample of barbarians previously known .",
    "we also note that , except in case of 236408 and 247356 ( only a single measurement each ) the resulting @xmath34 values are always well consistent with zero .",
    "our results confirm once again that asteroid polarimetry can provide an important contribution to asteroid taxonomy , as noted in the past by several authors ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "several problems , however , are now open , and deserve further theoretical and observational efforts .    the first issue to be addressed is the relationship between the barbarian polarimetric features and the unusual amount of spinel measured via spectroscopy in some of the known barbarians . in other words , the new barbarians that we have found in our investigation",
    "must be spectroscopically observed in the visible and near - ir wavelengths in order to check whether they exhibit the spinel features .",
    "we do believe that this will be the case , since we already know three objects that are both spinel - rich and barbarians ( 234 barbara , 387 aquitania and 980 anacostia ) , ad we know also that the watsonia family includes at least one other spinel - rich asteroid ( 599 luisa ) @xcite , but we clearly need confirmation from new observations .",
    "similarly , we need to search for the barbarian polarimetric feature in other spinel - rich asteroids . in particular , we are interested not only in 599 luisa , but also in the henan family , which is known to include at least three spinel - rich asteroids @xcite .",
    "next , we need to understand why the barbarian and the anomalous spinel abundance phenomena are so rare .",
    "apparently , only a handful of barbarian parent bodies existed , and only their disruption into many fragments made it possible to identify today larger numbers of these objects . in principle , one might wonder whether the unusual properties displayed by these objects might also be in some ( still obscure ) way a consequence of the collisional events themselves .",
    "another open problem is the origin of ( 387 ) aquitania .",
    "this asteroid is not included in any family list , including both the most recent classification available at the astdys site , and the @xcite classification of high-@xmath35 families . yet",
    ", this object is quite close , in terms of orbital elements , to ( 980 ) anacostia and the rest of the watsonia family .",
    "the values of proper elements for ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 980 ) anacostia ( available in the astdys database ) are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , for ( 387 ) aquitania , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 for ( 980 ) anacostia , where @xmath42 is the proper semi - major axis , @xmath43 the proper eccentricity , and @xmath35 is the proper inclination",
    ". the only one relevant difference , which prevents any family search to include them in an acceptable group , is the proper eccentricity .",
    "one should conclude that there is no relation between ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 980 ) anacostia , and that the similarity of their orbital semi - major axes and inclinations are just a coincidence .",
    "moreover , both asteroids display stable orbits in terms of characteristic lyapunov exponents , and any possible evolution due to non - gravitational forces , ( e.g.  the yarkovsky effect ) seem also very unlikely , because both asteroids are fairly large , with sizes of the order of @xmath44 km according to thermal radiometry data .",
    "finally , the collision which could have produced a family including two fragments of this size had to be extremely energetic , and should have produced a huge family , of which there is no evidence today .    on the other hand ,",
    "aquitania and anacostia exhibit too many relevant similarities in their physical properties , which suggests that they may come from a unique parent body fragmented by a collision .",
    "a very tentative scenario is that , in a very early epoch , a violent collision destroyed a big parent body which was the progenitor of the barbarians we see today in this zone .",
    "most of the first - generation fragments produced by the event are now gone due to gravitational perturbations and yarkovsky - driven drift in semi - major axis",
    ". the current watsonia family could be the product of a more recent disruption of one of the original fragments of the first event .",
    "this region could still include several first - generation fragments , preferentially the biggest ones which , due to their size , experienced no or extremely weak yarkovsky evolution , like ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 980 ) anacostia .",
    "some gravitational perturbations could have also played some role . if one looks at the @xmath42 - @xmath43 or @xmath42 - @xmath45 plots making use of the facility available at the astdys site , it is easy to see that the watsonia family is crossed , in semi - major axis , by a couple of thin resonances , one of which is located close to the value of @xmath42 of both ( 387 ) aquitania and ( 980 ) anacostia .",
    "so , we can not rule out entirely the idea that some limited evolution in eccentricity of these objects could be due to these perturbation effects and the two objects might have been originally closer in the proper element space .",
    "we stress again that this kind of scenario is only eminently speculative and deserves further analysis before it can be accepted as a plausible one .",
    "we point out that a so large relative fraction of observed members of the watsonia family turning out to be barbarians has a further implications to be taken into account .",
    "if the parent body was differentiated , or had some gradient of composition as a function of depth , with the presence of cai material limited to some thin shell , then the spinel signature would be present only in a minority of the family members .",
    "this is in disagreement with what we observe , indicating that the anomalous composition of the parent body was not limited to some thin region . in conclusion",
    ", we are not looking simply at some kind of surface process ( like alteration by space weathering or impacts ) , but at the properties displayed by asteroids originated from different depths inside a single parent body which was anomalously spinel - rich in most of its volume ( this can be even more true if the watsonia family is a secondary event derived by a first - generation destruction of a larger body . )    the issues of section  [ intro ] are still open and deserve careful attention .",
    "the immediate result of our investigation is that we have now a much larger sample of barbarians than before at disposal for future physical investigations ( including photometric , spectroscopic , and polarimetric campaigns . ) at the same time , our results definitively confirm the family of watsonia as a sizeable group of barbarians having a common collisional origin , and open new perspectives for the development of models in order to try and sort out in a coherent scenario several pieces of observational evidence which appear now to form a complicated puzzle .",
