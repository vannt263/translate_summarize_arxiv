    "the usual boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy is recovered when @xmath8 [ @xmath9 .",
    "many experimental and numerical data are well approximated by @xmath4-exponentials ( the probability distributions that maximize @xmath10 under simple constraints ) , giving support to the applicability of the new entropic measure to those systems . in the case of the high - dimensional systems of interest in statistical physics , first - principle derivations are still to be made .",
    "however , tsallis entropy seems to be the appropriate one for certain low - dimensional dynamical systems , such as unimodal maps at the edge of chaos , where the usual lyapunov exponent vanishes . in such cases",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath4 is related to relevant properties of the dynamics and it can be calculated by several paths , such as the multifractal spectrum of the attractor @xcite or the sensitivity to initial conditions @xcite , or even , from a rigorous renormalization group analysis @xcite . furthermore , this scenario has been shown to be valid also for two - dimensional maps @xcite .",
    "one of the properties of @xmath10 that , for an appropriate value of the entropic index , can make it in some cases preferable to the standard entropy is the possibility of having an asymptotic rate of entropy production with a non - trivial value . among the _ a priori _ infinite possible values of @xmath4 , the one leading to a linear increase of the entropy with time , implying _ finite _ rate of entropy growth ,",

    "in fact , this is another path for the determination of @xmath4 that in the case of unimodal maps provides the same results @xcite as the alternative methods mentioned above .",
    "moreover , rigorous analytical results have recently been found for such systems along this line @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of the @xmath10 family , allowing to determine @xmath11 , has also been investigated for diverse other dynamical systems @xcite . the outcome @xmath12 has usually been interpreted as a signal of nonextensivity .    under the scope of the generalized entropies",
    "@xmath10 , we will study in the present paper the temporal evolution of a cyclic lotka - volterra model in the lattice ( llv ) @xcite .",
    "this model is particularly rich as it exhibits interesting features , such as stationary states with spatial patterns @xcite and fractality @xcite , which makes it a potential candidate for the applicability of the entropies @xmath10 .",
    "the llv is one of the descendants of the original versions constructed by lotka@xcite and volterra @xcite to model autocatalytic chemical reactions and the prey - predator dynamics , respectively , and further adapted to many other situations from active transport by proteins @xcite to social processes @xcite .",
    "the generalized llv extends the original scheme to @xmath13 species @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) such that , cyclically , @xmath14 is `` predator '' of @xmath16 and simultaneously `` prey '' of @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 ) .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics takes place over a lattice , an ingredient that introduces new interesting spatial features in comparison to the spatially homogeneous mean - field description @xcite .",
    "the criterion of finite entropy rate has been applied before to the llv model in one and two dimensions @xcite and the relation @xmath3 was conjectured for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "now we will extend that study to higher dimensions in order to test the conjecture .",
    "moreover , we will essay an interpretation of the connection between @xmath11 and space dimensionality , showing that @xmath19 is not necessarily related to the fractal properties of the dynamics .",

    "particles of the @xmath13 different species @xmath14 are localized at the sites of a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",

    "no sites are empty but one of the species could be interpreted as representing empty sites in the lattice @xcite . the dynamics is implemented by means of a monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm following the details in refs .",
    "basically , at every microscopic step : ( i ) one lattice site is randomly chosen ; ( ii ) one of its nearest neighbors is randomly chosen ; ( iii ) if the first site is @xmath14 and the neighbor @xmath17 , the first site changes to @xmath17 with probability @xmath22 , in accord with scheme ( [ scheme ] ) , otherwise the site remains unchanged . each mc step ( mcs , our unit of time )",

    "we will deal with three species only ( @xmath25 ) and we will focus on the symmetric case where all the kinetic rates are equal to one ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "moreover , we will restrict our study to a particular mode of the dynamics , the `` nucleus growth '' one @xcite .",
    "the lattice is set with all the sites filled with species @xmath27 and a `` droplet '' or nucleus represented by a sublattice of small linear size @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) is introduced .",
    "the droplet contains equal amounts of particles of all the three species randomly and uniformly distributed .",
    "as the system evolves according to the mc dynamics , the droplet grows and acquires spontaneously a peculiar structure @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] for lattices in @xmath30 and 4 dimensions",
    ". rings of alternating species develop , repeating the sequence @xmath31 towards the center of the droplet .",
    "this pattern is possible since all the kinetic constants are equal , then layers have almost the same radial velocity .",
    "the thickness of the rings decreases towards the center and thickness fluctuations destroy the most immersed rings .",
    "this behavior has already been observed before by provata and tsekouras for the two dimensional case @xcite .",
    "they also observed that the destroyed rings give rise to a spatial organization of the species in domains with fractal boundaries typical of the steady state in fully occupied periodical lattices@xcite .",
    "as the dimensionality increases , spatial features remain qualitatively similar but length scales become shorter . in the mean - field limit @xmath32",

    "since we are dealing with a growth process , we will investigate in this section the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath0 resulting from some basic growth mechanisms and connect it with eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) .",
    "let us analyze the behavior of the entropies @xmath10 under a rescaling transformation of an arbitrary probability density @xmath64 , being @xmath65 a point in a @xmath0-dimensional space @xcite .",
    "the entropy of the rescaled function @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a linear length , becomes    @xmath68    as @xmath69 , the distribution broadens and the entropy grows due to the loss of order . if the scaling or stretching parameter increases exponentially with time , linear entropy increase occurs for @xmath8 .",
    "if the scaling parameter follows the law @xmath70 with @xmath71 , then the generalized entropies increase with time as follows : for @xmath72 , they scale with time as @xmath73 , @xmath74 in the marginal case @xmath8 , and for @xmath75 , saturation occurs at @xmath76 .",
    "hence a linear increase is achieved in the regime @xmath72 for    @xmath77    as a relevant particular case let us mention the normal diffusive spreading of a @xmath0-dimensional gaussian distribution where the stretching parameter is @xmath78 , with @xmath79 the positive diffusion constant . in this case @xmath80 then @xmath81 . the general case given by eq .",
    "( [ qdgamma ] ) may be due to anomalous diffusive motion",
    ". a still simpler example of rescaling transformation that will be useful later consists in a density being non - null and uniform inside a @xmath0-dimensional hypersphere and zero outside , such that the radius @xmath82 grows as @xmath70 .",
    "notice that the expression for @xmath11 of the growing llv droplet , given by eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) , is obtained when the temporal variation of the scaling length @xmath67 is ballistic ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "now , let us consider another simple process .",
    "@xmath84 windows cover a lattice , like for the llv in the previous section , with probabilities @xmath85 imagine that windows with non - null probability are replicated by an integer factor @xmath86 such that the new set of probabilities is @xmath87 if the replication factor is @xmath88 ( where @xmath67 is a typical linear size of the @xmath0-dimensional system ) and additionally if @xmath70 , then the entropy will be produced in such a way that a growth linear in time occurs for @xmath11 given by eq .",
    "( [ qdgamma ] ) .",
    "in fact , if a continuous distribution is discretized , the associated rescaling process can be thought as a particular case of the replication one here considered , a special case where replicas are spatially ordered .",
    "nevertheless for discrete probabilities , the entropic form @xmath10 does not depend on the spatial localization of the windows .    summarizing , while for an ordinary exponential growth process",
    ", the standard entropy @xmath89 increases linearly with @xmath44 ; for a process where growth follows a power - law in time , @xmath10 has the property of finite asymptotic entropy rate for some @xmath90 .",
    "this value of the entropic index can result from simple transformations and therefore may be trivially related to the lattice dimensionality .",
    "these ideas lead us to review the results of the precedent section to see whether simple mechanisms are also lurking there .",
    "let us inspect first the roughness of the interface because the reaction rate and therefore the dynamics of the propagating front are related to that quantity . since we are interested in the interface , one can perform numerical simulations considering just two species .",
    "hence we follow the evolution of an initial nucleus containing only @xmath36 particles dropped over a background of @xmath27 .",
    "its propagation is like in the llv case where a forefront of @xmath36 particles governs the spreading of the droplet . since the reaction rate must be proportional to the `` extent '' of the interface , we measure @xmath91 , the number of reactive sites constituting the interface , and @xmath92 , the total number of reactive faces in interfacial sites .",
    "reactive faces are those separating two nearest neighboring sites occupied by different species .",
    "a suitable quantity for our model is    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the connectivity , i.e , the number of first nearest neighbors _ per _ site ( @xmath95 in hypercubic lattices ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath96 represents an averaged measure of the degree of reactivity of an interfacial site , and must be also connected to the roughness of the interface . the reactivity @xmath96 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rough].a as a function of time .",
    "it soon reaches a stationary value within small fluctuations . for comparison",
    ", the figure also exhibits the value of @xmath96 for a regularly filled hypersphere with the same total number of cells as in the llv nucleus at each given @xmath44 .",
    "the higher the lattice dimensionality , the larger the relative difference between the values of @xmath96 for the two models .",
    "the roughness of the propagation front in the 1d dynamics has been studied in detail by provata and tsekouras @xcite .",
    "also in this case , it was shown that after a brief transient the rough profile remains stable in average .     in a lattice filled with @xmath27 , for different values of @xmath0 indicated in the figure .",
    "( a ) reactivity @xmath96 as a function of time for the two - species llv ( full lines ) ; for comparison , @xmath96 for a regularly filled hypersphere with the same total number of cells as the corresponding llv nucleus is also plotted ( dotted lines ) .",
    "( b ) total number of sites @xmath97 occupied by @xmath36 vs. time .",
    "the initial nucleus has linear size @xmath62.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    if the reactivity remains constant in time , the front moves at constant radial speed : @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is an effective radius @xmath100 and the velocity @xmath101 an increasing function of its argument for a given @xmath0 .",
    "although the fractal properties of the interface are embodied in the velocity , if the roughness soon reaches its steady value , then fractality does not affect the temporal law of the front propagation .",
    "in effect , the linear dependence of @xmath99 with time is observed in numerical experiments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rough].b ) .",
    "therefore , following the considerations of the precedent section , eq .",
    "( [ qdgamma ] ) with @xmath83 must clearly hold in this binary case .    in the three - species case , although the reaction scheme is cyclic , symmetry is broken by the initial condition .",
    "species @xmath27 plays the special role of a background what in turn makes @xmath36 play the special role of the forefront species . after a short transient and before the limits of the lattice",
    "are reached by the nucleus , the stationarity of the interface reactivity @xmath96 , leads to a linear growth of the effective radius with time , as in the two species case .",
    "consequently , the total number of cells in the nucleus , protected by the most external ring constituted by @xmath36 cells , will increase as @xmath102 . behind the first ring , the three species are equivalent",
    ", then the total number of cells occupied by each species in the nucleus is expected to increase with the same law @xmath102 too .",
    "in fact , this behavior is observed in numerical simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1n2 ] , although species @xmath36 yields a slightly larger slope than @xmath37 .",
    "linear growth implies a regime where the concentrations in the nucleus are conserved .",
    "when full occupation of the lattice is attained , the concentration of each species @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) fluctuates around the stable center predicted by the mean - field theory : @xmath105 , for all @xmath42 @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath106 occupied by species @xmath36 ( a ) and @xmath37 ( b ) , respectively , for the values of the lattice dimensionality indicated in the figure and for various lattice sizes @xmath24 : 150 and 200 ( @xmath107 ) , 100 and 150 ( @xmath51 ) , and 60 and 100 ( @xmath56 ) , represented by dotted and full lines respectively .",

    "thus , in the extreme case when windows have the size of a cell ( @xmath109 ) , a linear increase of @xmath10 with time occurs clearly for @xmath4 given by eq .",
    ". in fact there will be @xmath97 windows with non - null probability @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , then @xmath112 , so that : @xmath113 , if @xmath114 . in the opposite extreme where windows are so large that all non - empty windows have approximately the same occupation number , that same temporal dependence is obtained too .",

    ", scaledwidth=35.0% ]    let us analyze what happens for intermediate window sizes .",
    "clusters of cells of each species like in fully occupied lattices @xcite appear in the interior of the nucleus .",
    "it is not counterintuitive the idea that as the volume of the nucleus is increasing , the size distribution of the agglomerates becomes stationary after a transient .",
    "to test this idea one can calculate for instance the occupation numbers of the windows , intimately related to entropy computation , and see how their distribution evolves in time . fig .  [",
    "fig : occupation ] exhibits the number of windows @xmath115 occupied by at most @xmath42 cells of species @xmath36 ( @xmath116 ) , for different time instants .",
    "the occupation number for @xmath121 is dismissed whereas it does not contribute to the entropy and a cumulative probability is considered in order to get smoother curves .",
    "notice that the curves in the log - linear plot are practically parallel , indicating that they differ in a multiplicative factor .",
    "moreover , the replication factor increases following the law @xmath102 as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : occupation ] and in accord with previous considerations .",
    "all this means that a replication of the windows as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : cases ] with @xmath83 is going on .    in conclusion , although the underlying dynamics is complex , once the properties of spatial structures attain steady values , growth is controlled by simple laws .",
    "more specifically , the resulting growth processes are power - law in time with scaling exponents trivially related to the lattice dimensionality ( with @xmath122 or , equivalently , @xmath83 ) .",
    "then , the linear increase of @xmath10 with time for @xmath11 given by eq .",

    "moreover we exhibited the mechanisms leading to such relation .",

    "we have seen that , for the present model and for the particular probability assignment considered , @xmath10 entropy production does not capture directly the fractality of spatial patterns .",
