    "* we first note that we can consider the set of kraus operators with the same output space .",

    ", we write the following relations : @xmath236 here , step ( [ comon1 ] ) follows from ( [ mnren ] ) , and step ( [ comon2 ] ) follows from ( [ tdit ] ) .",

    "seems to be difficult .",
    "the only known examples are the measures @xmath241 and @xmath239 . of course",
    ", we do not consider here any linear combination of the mentioned two measures .",
    "as the properties imposed are linear in a coherence measure , a linear combination of two ( or more ) particular measures will obey these properties whenever each particular measure does .",
    "in this section , we will compare two quantifiers of coherence obtained as homogeneous quadratic functions of matrix elements .",
    "these measures are respectively defined by the formulas ( [ c22nrm ] ) and ( [ cma2 ] ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite exemplified that the coherence measure ( [ c22nrm ] ) is not monotone under incoherent selective measurements .",
    "it is instructive to examine the property ( [ insela ] ) just with this example .",
    "let us check monotonicity of the coherence measure ( [ cma2 ] ) .",
    "in the example considered , the input and output reference bases are the same . for brevity , we will omit the symbols @xmath33 and @xmath203 in further calculations .",
    "the two kraus operators are written as @xmath242 where the complex numbers @xmath243 and @xmath244 obey @xmath245 .",

    "the latter point illustrates the result ( [ insela ] ) .",
    "the example also shows that the formulation ( [ insela ] ) is actually necessary .",
    "indeed , the quantifier ( [ cma2 ] ) does not share the monotonicity formulation ( [ consel ] ) . to see this fact , we write @xmath259 the right - hand side of ( [ q2p1 ] ) increases up to @xmath260 for @xmath261 and can exceed @xmath262 .",
    "the above findings give an evidence that the @xmath40-quantifiers do not generally obey monotonicity in the form of ( [ consel ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", these measures certainly satisfy monotonicity in the form of ( [ insela ] ) .",
    "thus , the monotonicity of coherence under selective measurements is sophisticated in character .",
    "this property does not follow immediately from the monotonicity of quantum relative entropies .",
    "the considered example allows us to resolve the following natural question . the coherence measure ( [ c22nrm ] )",
    "does not share monotonicity in the form of ( [ consel ] ) . in principle",
    ", we may ask for monotonicity of ( [ c22nrm ] ) similarly to ( [ insela ] ) .",
    "in other words , we consider the quantity @xmath263 where @xmath264 and @xmath265 is obtained from @xmath18 by vanishing all off - diagonal entries .",
    "the above example shows that ( [ insela2 ] ) can exceed @xmath266 . indeed , the input state ( [ php21 ] ) is such that @xmath267 for @xmath268 .",
    "hence , the quantity ( [ insela2 ] ) is equal to @xmath269 and violates monotonicity in the form of ( [ consel ] ) , as already known .",
    "thus , the coherence measure ( [ c22nrm ] ) is not monotone even in the sense of ( [ insela ] ) .",
    "this fact shows that the formulation ( [ insela ] ) is not trivial .",
    "it is also reduced to ( [ consel ] ) in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we can treat ( [ insela ] ) as a natural extension of the standard form ( [ consel ] ) .",
    "we have examined quantum - coherence measures based on @xmath40-divergences of the tsallis type .",
    "trade - off relations between coherence and mixedness were obtained .",
    "some properties were further exemplified with a single qubit .",
    "most of the desired properties immediately follows from general properties of quantum relative entropies .",
    "the monotonicity of coherence under selective measurements is a more interesting and complicated question .",
    "this monotonicity has been shown for the two measures based on the @xmath15-norm and on the standard relative entropy @xcite .",
    "for the coherence measure based on the trace distance , only particular monotonicity results are known @xcite .",
    "we have proved that coherence @xmath40-measures enjoy desired monotonicity in the form of ( [ insela ] ) , where the parameter @xmath40 is involved . for @xmath47 , this formulation is directly reduced to the standard formulation proposed in @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the result ( [ insela ] ) is a parametric extension of the standard form ( [ consel ] ) .",
    "it may be supposed that the two known examples satisfying just ( [ consel ] ) are the only such .",
    "the obtained family includes the quantity expressed in terms of the squared moduli of matrix elements . in several respects ,",
    "this quantity differs from the coherence measure induced by the squared @xmath0-norm . in both ( [ c1nrm ] ) and ( [ c22nrm ] ) , the closest incoherent state is obtained by vanishing all off - diagonal entries of @xmath18 .",
    "except for @xmath109 , the incoherent state that minimizes the @xmath40-divergence in ( [ c1dt ] ) is reached by a more complicated procedure .",
    "nevertheless , for quantum @xmath40-divergences of the tsallis type , the required minimization can be solved with an explicit answer .",
    "it seems to be difficult for quantum @xmath38-divergences in general .",
    "currently , so - called `` sandwiched '' relative entropies are the subject of active research @xcite .",
    "such quantities could be used for obtaining of coherence measures but he required minimization seems to be difficult . by comparing two quadratic measures of coherence , we also have shown that the measure induced by the squared @xmath0-norm violates monotonicity even in an generalized form .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the square root of ( [ c22nrm ] ) may obey all the desired properties .",
