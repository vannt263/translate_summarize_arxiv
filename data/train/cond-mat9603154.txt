    "many driven systems in nature respond to external perturbations by a hierarchy of avalanche events .",
    "this type of behavior is observed in magnetic systems @xcite , flux lines in superconductors @xcite , fluid flow through porous media @xcite , microfracturing processes @xcite , earthquakes @xcite , and physiological phenomena @xcite . in these systems",
    "the distribution of avalanche amplitudes @xmath0 decays as a power law , @xmath1 , thus suggesting an analogy with critical phenomena .",
    "self - organized criticality ( soc ) was proposed @xcite as a possible framework to describe those phenomena .",
    "power - law scaling would emerge spontaneously due to the dynamics , without the fine tuning of external parameters such as the temperature .",
    "various models have been proposed with the aim of capturing the essential features of avalanche dynamics and self - organization .",
    "in particular , sandpile models stimulated an intense experimental @xcite , numerical @xcite and theoretical @xcite activity .",
    "as in the case of phase transitions , mean - field theory represents the simplest approach that gives a qualitative description of the system .",
    "mean - field exponents for soc models have been obtained in different ways @xcite , but it turns out that their values ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) are the same for all the models considered thus far .",
    "this fact can easily be understood since the spreading of an avalanche in mean - field theory is a branching process @xcite because an avalanche can be described by a front of `` non - interacting particles '' that can either trigger subsequent activity or die out .",
    "the connection between branching processes and soc has been investigated , and it has been proposed that the mean - field behavior of sandpile models can be described by a _",
    "critical _ branching process @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the self - organization was not addressed by the previous approaches .",
    "in fact the branching process is critical only for a given value of the branching probability , while in sandpile models there is no such tuning .",
    "recently , we have introduced the `` self - organized branching process '' ( sobp ) @xcite , a mean - field model that allows one to clarify the mechanism of self - organization in sandpile models . moreover",
    ", the sobp model can be exactly mapped onto a two - state sandpile model in the limit @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dimension of the system .    in experiments",
    "it can be difficult to determine whether the cutoff in the scaling is due to finite - size effects or due to the fact that the system is not _ at _ but rather only _ close to _ the critical point . in this respect , it is important to test the robustness of soc behavior by understanding which perturbations destroy the critical properties of soc model .",
    "it has been shown numerically @xcite that the breaking of the conservation of particle numbers leads to a characteristic size in the avalanche distributions . here",
    "we generalize the sobp in order to allow for dissipation and we show , in the mean - field approximation , how the system self - organizes in a _ sub - critical _ state .",
    "in other words , the degree of nonconservation is a relevant parameter in the renormalization group sense @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we derive the sobp from a dissipative sandpile model .",
    "in section iii we study the approach to the critical state .",
    "the critical exponents are evaluated in section iv , and the results are verified numerically .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions .",
    "sandpile models are cellular automata with an integer or continuous variable @xmath5 ( energy ) associated with each site @xmath6 of a @xmath7dimensional lattice . at each time step the energy of a randomly chosen site is increased by some amount . when the energy on a site reaches a threshold @xmath8 the site becomes unstable and _ relaxes _ by transferring its energy to its neighbors according to the specific rules of the model .",
    "in this way , a single relaxation can trigger other relaxations , leading to the formation of an avalanche .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen to be open , so avalanches that reach the boundaries release energy outside of the system .",
    "after a transient , the system reaches a steady state characterized by a balance between the input and the output of energy .",
    "let us now consider a particular sandpile model : the two - state model introduced by manna @xcite .",
    "energy can take only two stable values @xmath9 ( empty site ) and @xmath10 ( particle ) . when @xmath11 the site relaxes , @xmath12 , and the energy of two randomly chosen neighbors is increased by one .",
    "this rule conserves the energy , in this case the number of particles , during an avalanche and leads to a stationary critical state",
    ".    some degree of nonconservation can be introduced in the model by allowing for energy dissipation in a relaxation event . in a continuous energy model",
    "this can be done by transferring to the neighboring sites only a fraction @xmath13 of the energy lost by the relaxing site @xcite . in a discrete energy model , such as the manna two - state model",
    ", one can introduce as the probability @xmath14 that the two particles transferred by the relaxing site are annihilated @xcite . for @xmath15",
    "one recovers the original two - state model .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show that the two ways of considering dissipation lead to the same effect : a characteristic length is introduced into the system and the criticality is lost . as a result",
    ", the avalanche size distribution decays not as a pure power law but rather as @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a cutoff function and the cutoff size scales as @xmath18 the size @xmath0 is defined as the number of sites that relax in an avalanche .",
    "we define the avalanche lifetime @xmath19 as the number of steps comprising an avalanche .",
    "the corresponding distribution decays as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is another cutoff function and @xmath22 is a cutoff that scales as @xmath23 the cutoff or `` scaling '' functions @xmath17 and @xmath21 fall off exponentially for @xmath24 .    to construct the mean - field theory",
    ", we consider the model as @xmath3 i.e. for an infinite dimensional lattice .",
    "when a particle is added to an arbitrary site , the site will relax if a particle was already present , which occurs with probability @xmath25 , the probability that the site is occupied .",
    "if a relaxation occurs , the two particles are transferred with probability @xmath26 to two of the infinitely many nearest neighbors , or they are dissipated with probability @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath3 implies that the lattice coordination number tends to infinity , the avalanche will never visit the same site twice , implying that each site that receives a particle from a neighbor relaxes with the same probability .",
    "the avalanche process in the mean - field limit is a branching process .",
    "moreover , we note that the branching process can be described by the _ effective _ branching probability @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability to create two new active sites . from the theory of branching processes @xcite , we know that there is a critical value , @xmath29 , or @xmath30 such that for @xmath31 the probability to have an infinite avalanche is non - zero , while for @xmath32 all avalanches are finite .",
    "the value @xmath33 corresponds to the critical case where avalanches are power law distributed .",
    "boundary conditions are important for the process of self - organization .",
    "we can introduce the `` boundary conditions '' in the mean - field theory in a natural way by allowing for no more than @xmath34 generations for each avalanche .",
    "we can view the evolution of a single avalanche of size @xmath0 as taking place on a tree of @xmath35 sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bp ] ) . note that we are not studying the model on a bethe lattice @xcite ; i.e. , the branching structure we are discussing is not directly related to the geometry of the system .",
    "the number of generations @xmath34 can , nevertheless , be thought of as some measure of the linear dimension of the system .",
    "if the avalanche reaches the boundary of the tree , we count the number of active sites @xmath36 ( which in the sandpile language corresponds to the energy leaving the system ) , and we expect that @xmath37 decreases for the next avalanche .",
    "if , on the other hand , the avalanche stops before reaching the boundary , then @xmath37 will slightly increase .",
    "= 8.0 cm    to make the above statements quantitative , consider the evolution of the total number of particles @xmath38 in the system after each avalanche : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the number of particles that leave the system from the boundaries and @xmath41 is the number of particles lost by dissipation .",
    "since @xmath42 , we obtain an evolution equation for the parameter @xmath37 : @xmath43 this equation reduces to the sobp model @xcite for the case of no dissipation ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the implications of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p(t)-disc ] ) will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "in order to characterize the steady state of the sobp model , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : p(t)-disc ] ) in terms of the average values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 indicated by angular brackets .",
    "the average number of particles @xmath45 leaving the system from the boundaries in a system of @xmath34 generations is computed @xcite because of the recursive nature of the process : @xmath46    the evaluation of the average number of particles dissipated during an avalanche is somewhat more involved .",
    "we can first relate the average value of @xmath41 to the average number of sites @xmath47 where an avalanche does not branch  either because of dissipation or because the site was empty ( i.e. , the avalanche stops ) , @xmath48 the calculation of @xmath49 then reduces to the calculation of @xmath50 .",

    "thus it follows that in the limit @xmath65 the distribution @xmath66 of @xmath37 approaches a delta function @xmath67    by comparing the fixed point value ( [ eq : p * ] ) with the critical value ( [ eq : p_c ] ) , we obtain that in the presence of dissipation ( @xmath68 ) the self - organized steady - state of the system is _",
