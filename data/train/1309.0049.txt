    "many models in the sciences and engineering are expressed as sets of real solutions to systems of polynomial equations in @xmath0 unknowns .",
    "for such a real algebraic variety @xmath1 , we consider the following problem : given @xmath2 , compute @xmath3 that minimizes the squared euclidean distance @xmath4 from the given point @xmath5 .",
    "this optimization problem arises in a wide range of applications . for instance",
    ", if @xmath5 is a noisy sample from @xmath6 , where the error model is a standard gaussian in @xmath7 , then @xmath8 is the maximum likelihood estimate for  @xmath5 .    in order to find @xmath8 algebraically ,",
    "we consider the set of solutions in @xmath9 to the equations defining @xmath6 . in this manner",
    ", we regard @xmath6 as a complex variety in @xmath9 , and we examine all complex critical points of the squared distance function @xmath10 on @xmath6 . here",
    "we only allow those critical points @xmath11 that are non - singular on @xmath6 .",
    "the number of such critical points is constant on a dense open subset of data @xmath12 .",
    "that number is called the _ euclidean distance degree _ ( or ed degree ) of the variety @xmath6 , and denoted as eddegree(x ) .    the ed degree of a variety @xmath6 measures the algebraic complexity of writing the optimal solution @xmath8 of @xmath13 over @xmath6 .",
    "it is a function of the input data and an important invariant of the optimization problem .",
    "this paper describes the basic properties of the ed degree using tools from computational and classical algebraic geometry . in many situations ,",
    "our techniques offer formulas for this invariant .",
    "our goal is to establish the foundations of ed degree so that it can be specialized in specific instances to solve the optimization problem .",
    "using lagrange multipliers , and the observation that @xmath14 , our problem amounts to computing all regular points @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is perpendicular to the tangent space @xmath17 of @xmath6 at @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we seek to solve the constraints @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the singular locus of @xmath6 . the ed degree of  @xmath6 counts the solutions @xmath11 .    [ ex : cardioid ] we illustrate our problem for a plane curve .",
    "figure  [ fig : logo ] shows the _ cardioid _",
    "@xmath20 for general data @xmath21 in @xmath22 , the cardioid @xmath6 contains precisely three points @xmath23 whose tangent line is perpendicular to @xmath24 .",
    "thus @xmath25 .",
    "all three critical points @xmath26 are real , provided @xmath21 lies outside the _ evolute _ , which is the small inner cardioid @xmath27 the evolute is called the _ ed discriminant _ in this paper .",

    "thus , ed degree and ml degree are close cousins .    for most varieties @xmath6 and most data @xmath5 ,",
    "the number of real critical points is much smaller than @xmath33 . to quantify that difference we also study the expected number of real critical points of @xmath28 on @xmath6 .",
    "this number , denoted @xmath34 and called the _ average ed degree _",
    ", depends on the underlying probability distribution on @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , for the cardioid @xmath6 in example [ ex : cardioid ] , the invariant @xmath34 can be any real number between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the specific value depends on how we sample the data points @xmath21 from @xmath22 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : equations ] we rigorously define ed degree for affine and projective varieties , and show how the ed degree of @xmath6 and all critical points of @xmath28 can be computed in practice .",
    "the projective case is important because many varieties in applications are defined by homogenous equations . for the most part",
    ", our exposition assumes no prerequisites beyond undergraduate mathematics .",
    "we follow the book by cox , little and oshea @xcite , and we illustrate the main concepts with code in macaulay2 @xcite .    section [ sec : firstapp ] is devoted to case studies in control theory , geometric modeling , computer vision , and low rank matrix completion .",
    "new results include formulas for the ed degree for the hurwitz stability problem and for the number of critical formations on the line , as in @xcite .    in section  [ sec : correspondence ]",
    "we introduce the _ ed correspondence _",
    "@xmath37 , which is the variety of pairs @xmath38 where @xmath15 is critical for @xmath28 .",
    "the ed correspondence is of vital importance for the computation of average ed degrees , in that same section .",
    "we show how to derive parametric representations of @xmath37 , and how these translate into integral representations for @xmath34 .",
    "duality plays a key role in both algebraic geometry and optimization theory @xcite .",
    "every projective variety @xmath39 has a dual variety @xmath40 , whose points are the hyperplanes tangent to @xmath6 . in section",
    "[ sec : duality ] we prove that @xmath41 , we express this number as the sum of the classical polar classes @xcite , and we lift the ed correspondence to the conormal variety of @xmath42 .",
    "when @xmath6 is smooth and toric , we obtain a combinatorial formula for @xmath33 in terms of the volumes of faces of the corresponding polytope .",
    "in section  [ sec : geomop ] we study the behavior of the ed degree under linear projections and under intersections with linear subspaces .",
    "we also examine the fact that the ed degree can go up or can go down when passing from an affine variety in @xmath9 to its projective closure in @xmath43 .",
    "in section  [ sec : chern ] we express @xmath33 in terms of chern classes when @xmath6 is smooth and projective , and we apply this to classical segre and veronese varieties .",
    "we also study the _ ed discriminant _ which is the locus of all data points @xmath5 where two critical points of @xmath28 coincide .",
    "for instance , in example [ ex : cardioid ] , the ed discriminant is the inner cardioid .",
    "work of catanese , trifogli and others @xcite offers degree formulas for ed discriminants in various situations .",
    "as we will see in example  [ ex : eckartyoung ] , the ed degree of the variety of bounded - rank matrices can be derived from the _ eckart - young theorem_. the singular value decomposition furnishes the critical points .",
    "the case of multidimensional _ tensors _ , while of equally fundamental importance , is much more involved . in section  [ sec : tensors ] , following @xcite , we give an account of recent results on the ordinary and average ed degree of the variety of rank one tensors .",
    "even though the problem of minimizing euclidean distance to a variety arises in a number of applications , there seems to be no systematic study of this problem in the generality that we address here .",
    "this paper aims to lay down the foundations for solving this problem using tools from algebraic geometry and computational algebra . in section  [ sec : firstapp ] we will see many formulas for the ed degree in specific instances , some of which are new while others reprove existing results in the literature using our tools and uniform framework .",
    "the remaining sections explore several different aspects of the ed degree and offer many possible directions in which the general theory can be further developed or tailored to particular applications .",
    "our ed degree umbrella brings under it a variety of applications and theoretical tools , and draws on previous work that relates to subjects such as the catanese - trifogli formula for the ed discriminant ( section  [ sec : chern ] ) and the work of piene and holme on duality ( section  [ sec : duality ] ) .",
    "an algebraic variety @xmath6 in @xmath7 can be described either implicitly , by a system of polynomial equations in @xmath0 variables , or parametrically , as the closure of the image of a polynomial map @xmath44 .",
    "the second representation arises frequently in applications , but it is restricted to varieties @xmath6 that are unirational . the first representation exists for any variety @xmath6 . in what follows",
    "we start with the implicit representation , and we derive the polynomial equations that characterize the critical points of the squared distance function @xmath45 on  @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath28 extends to a polynomial function on @xmath9 .",
    "so , if @xmath11 is a complex point in @xmath6 then @xmath13 is usually a complex number , and that number can be zero even if @xmath46 . the hermitian inner product and",
    "its induced metric on @xmath9 will not appear in this paper .",
    "fix a radical ideal @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 its variety in @xmath9 .",
    "since ed degree is additive over the components of @xmath6 , we may assume that @xmath6 is irreducible and that @xmath49 is a prime ideal .",
    "the formulation ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) translates into a system of polynomial equations as follows .",
    "we write @xmath50 for the @xmath51",
    "jacobian matrix , whose entry in row @xmath52 and column @xmath53 is the partial derivative @xmath54 .",
    "the singular locus @xmath19 of @xmath6 is defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the codimension of @xmath6 .",
    "the ideal @xmath57 can in fact be non - radical , but that does not matter for our purposes .",
    "we now augment the jacobian matrix @xmath50 with the row vector @xmath58 to get an @xmath59-matrix . that matrix has rank @xmath60 on the critical points of @xmath28 on @xmath6 .",
    "from the subvariety of @xmath6 defined by these rank constraints we must remove contributions from the singular locus @xmath19 .",
    "thus the _ critical ideal _ for @xmath61 is the following saturation : @xmath62 note that if @xmath49 were not radical , then the above ideal could have an empty variety .",
    "[ lem : edd ] for general @xmath61 , the variety of the critical ideal in @xmath9 is finite .",
    "it consists precisely of the critical points of the squared distance function @xmath28 on the manifold @xmath63 .    for fixed @xmath64 , the jacobian @xmath50 has rank @xmath56 , so the data points @xmath5 where the @xmath65-minors of @xmath66 vanish form an affine - linear subspace in @xmath9 of dimension @xmath56 .",
    "hence the variety of pairs @xmath67 that are zeros of ( [ eq : critideal ] ) is irreducible of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the fiber of its projection into the second factor over a general point @xmath61 must hence be finite .",
    "the _ ed degree _ of @xmath6 is defined to be the number of critical points in lemma [ lem : edd ] .",

    "the critical equations ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) take the form @xmath15 and @xmath68 .",
    "these linear equations have a unique solution @xmath8 .",
