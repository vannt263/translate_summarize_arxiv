    "weak gravitational lensing produces coherent distortions in the images of background galaxies .",
    "this effect provides a unique method to measure directly the distribution of mass in the universe ( for reviews see schneider et al .",
    "1992 ; narayan & bartelmann 1996 ; mellier 1999 ) .",
    "this technique is now routinely used to map the mass of clusters of galaxies ( for a review , see fort & mellier 1994 ) .",
    "a search for weak lensing by large - scale structure is the subject of much recent and on - going theoretical and observational effort ( eg . villumsen 1995 ; stebbins , et al .",
    "1995 ; kaiser 1996 ; schneider et al . 1997",
    "; van waerbeke et al . 1998 ; refregier et al .",
    "1998 ; see refregier 1999 for a bibliography ) .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that the lensing distortions are small ( @xmath0 for clusters and @xmath1 for large - scale structure ) , thus requiring high precision measurements and tight control of systematic effects .",
    "kaiser , squires and broadhurst ( 1995 , ksb ) have developed a method to correct for the major systematic effects , namely the anisotropy of the point - spread function ( psf ) and camera distortions , and to calibrate the relation between galaxy ellipticities and lensing shear ( for other methods , see also bonnet & mellier 1995 ; schneider & seitz 1995 ) .",
    "further elements of their method were presented in luppino & kaiser ( 1997 , lk ) and in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 1998 , hfks ) .",
    "recently , kaiser ( 1999 ) pointed out that the ksb method had several shortcomings , all stemming from the fact that most psfs encountered in practice are not sufficiently compact .",
    "kaiser then proposed another method based on the explicit construction of the post - convolution shear operator .",
    "another alternative method was recently proposed by kuijken ( 1999 ) . in this different approach",
    ", a sheared and convolved isotropic model is fitted to the galaxy image , so as to derive an estimator for the shear .",
    "these two methods are promising , but both require complete knowledge of the 2-dimensional psf function , while psf measurements are sparse due to the finite number of stellar images .    here",
    ", we revisit the ksb method , which has the advantage both of being linear and of relying only on the first multipole moments of the psf and galaxy images .",
    "we focus on the demanding search for weak lensing by large - scale structure .",
    "we show that both the psf and the camera distortions can be corrected for using source moments , as opposed to ellipticities .",
    "we clarify the applicability of some of the approximations made in this method , and show how the weight function for stars can be chosen to be different from that for galaxies .",
    "we derive expressions for the corrections in term of the moments only . by decomposing the moments into spinors",
    ", we derive an explicit relation between the shear and the average ellipticity .",
    "we discuss the shortcomings of the method discussed in kaiser ( 1999 ) and kuijken ( 1999 ) , and test its validity using numerical simulations .    as an application",
    ", we consider weak lensing measurements with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the small psf and absence of atmospheric seeing makes hst an ideal instrument for weak lensing measurements ( eg .",
    "kneib et al .",
    "1996 ; hfks ) .",
    "we reproduce the analysis of hfks who studied , in detail , the psf and camera distortion of the wfpc2 camera onboard hst .",
    "we apply these calibrations to the galaxies in the hst survey strip known as the `` groth strip '' ( groth et al .",
    "1995 , rhodes 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , we show how the psf anisotropy and camera distortions depend on the size of the galaxies .",
    "we also discuss the prospects of weak lensing measurements with hst .",
    "a description of our search for weak lensing by large - scale structure with the survey strip will be presented in rhodes , refregier , & groth 1999 ( see also rhodes 1999 ) .    because the method is somewhat complex ,",
    "we provide a practical summary in  [ overview ]",
    "in which we point to the results and equations which are of direct practical interest . in  [ shapes ] , we describe measures of object shapes .",
    "next , in  [ distortion ] and  [ convolution ] , we show how these measures are affected by the two main classes of deformations , namely convolutions and distortions , and derive explicit expressions to correct for them . in  [ comb ] , we study the effect of shear combined with a convolution on the observed ellipticity . in  [ validity ] , we discuss the shortcomings of the method , and test its validity using numerical simulations . in  [ hst ]",
    ", we apply our method to hst observations .",
    "in particular , we consider measurements of the camera distortion , globular cluster observations , and finally apply our results to the survey strip .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the purpose of this method is to provide a measure of the shapes of galaxies , to correct for instrumental effects , and to derive an estimate for the weak lensing shear .",
    "the images of galaxies are assumed to be altered by two kinds of operations : _ distortions _ ( sometimes simply called shear ) , which are intensity - conserving mappings between the source plane and the image plane ( see eq.[[eq : fprime ] ] ) , and _ convolutions _ ( or smear ; see eq.[[eq : iprime_conv ] ] ) .",
    "specifically , we follow ksb and hfks and assume that a galaxy image is altered by a distortion due to gravitational lensing , followed by a convolution by a generally anisotropic psf , and then by a distortion due to the camera optics .",
    "schematically , we can write @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 symbolize distortions and convolutions , respectively . here",
    ", we revisit the ksb method .",
    "we show how to correct for the two latter effects and how to calibrate the sought - after effect of lensing .",
    "the synopsis of our method is shown on figure  [ fig : synopsis ] .",
    "since the method is somewhat complex , we provide here a summary of the method , and point to the equations which are of direct practical interest .",
    "references to these equations can also be found on this figure .",
    "the basis of the method is to characterize the shapes of galaxies and stars by measuring their multipole moments @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc .",
    "( eq .  [ [ eq : jij_def ] ] ) . to enforce convergence in the presence of image noise",
    ", these moments are measured with a weight function @xmath7 which we choose to be a gaussian of width @xmath8 ( eq .  [ [ eq : w_gaussian ] ] ) .",
    "this choice allows us to write all the expressions for the corrections in terms of the moments . unlike ksb ,",
    "we perform all the corrections using moments , and postpone the use of ellipticities ( eq .  [ [ eq : epsilon_def ] ] ) until the last step .",
    "this has the advantage of keeping track of the size of the psf and of the galaxies , and thus of reducing the noise resulting from the corrections , if the psf size varies across the field .",
    "the first step consists of deriving the distortion matrix @xmath9 ( eq .  [ [ eq : phi_def ] ] ) for the camera distortion .",
    "hfks showed that this could be achieved by considering astrometric shift solutions , such as that of holtzmann et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the wfpc2 camera on hst . the resulting shear pattern for wfpc2 is shown on figure  [ fig : wf_shear ] .",

    "we derive the psf moments from stellar images .",
    "for this purpose , the stellar multipole moments @xmath10 and @xmath11 are measured using an optimally chosen weight - function width @xmath12 .",
    "these moments are then corrected for the weight function to provide ( an approximation to ) the unweighted moments of the psf ( eqs .",

    "this provides the corrected unweighted psf moments @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : pij_def],[eq : pijkl_def ] ] ) , that can be then be interpolated across the field using low - order polynomial fits for each component . figures  [ fig : m4ellipt ] and [ fig : ngc6572 ] show the resulting ellipticities of the wfpc2 psf derived from two globular clusters , while figure  [ fig : m4sm ] shows the interpolated psf ellipticities derived from a combination of the two after the moments have been corrected for weighting and camera distortion .    in the third step",
    ", we measure the galaxy moments and correct them for instrumental effects . the galaxy moments @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are measured using an optimal weight - function width @xmath8 .",
    "they are then corrected for the camera distortion using @xmath16 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : jij_dcorrection],[eq : jijkl_dcorrection ] ] ) .",
    "the psf can be decomposed into an anisotropic and an isotropic part ( eq .  [ [ eq : p_decomp ] ] ) .",
    "we correct the galaxy moments @xmath5 for the psf anisotropy , by expanding in powers of the psf ellipticity ( eq .  [ [ eq : jij_acorrection ] ] ) .",
    "since , by construction , the isotropic part of the psf is a gaussian ( eq .  [ [ eq : pi_gaussian ] ] ) , we can perform the isotropic correction exactly for @xmath5 ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : jij_icorrection ] ] ) .",
    "the fourth order moments @xmath6 are then approximately corrected for the psf ( eq .  [ [ eq : jijkl_correction ] ] ) .",
    "this provides us with the corrected galaxy moments @xmath17 and @xmath18 which are now effectively weighted by the new weight - function width @xmath19 ( eq .  [ [ eq : omega_g ] ] ) .",
    "the final step consists of measuring the weak lensing shear by averaging over an ensemble of galaxies in a region of the sky . for this purpose ,",
    "we compute the ellipticity @xmath20 of each galaxy from its corrected moments @xmath17 ( eq .  [ [ eq : epsilon_def ] ] ) .",
    "the weak lensing shear @xmath21 is then computed from the average ellipticity @xmath22 ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : gamma_epsilon ] ] ) . in this last step",
    ", one should remember to use @xmath19 rather than @xmath8 as the weight - function width .",
    "the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath23 is greatly simplified by considering the rotation properties of the multipole moments ( see  [ rotations ] ) .",

    "[ hst ] , we discuss the application of our method to the hst survey strip .",
    "in this section , we show how object shapes can be characterised using multipole moments and related quantities .",
    "we also study the rotational properties of the moments and decompose them into spinor representations .",
    "let us consider a source with intensity @xmath24 .",
    "as a first step , we find the centroid @xmath25 of the source by solving @xmath26 where @xmath7 is a weight function introduced to ensure convergence in the presence of noise . in this paper , we will consider a normalized gaussian weight function , @xmath27 which has convenient analytical properties . in practice ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : centroid ] ) can be solved iteratively , by fixing the weight - function width @xmath8 to an initial estimate of the source size ( see  [ w_choice ] for a description of our choice of @xmath8 for the hst survey strip ) .    to characterize the source shape , we consider the weighted multipole moments of the source intensity , @xmath28 where the origin of the coordinate system was chosen to coincide with @xmath25 .",

    "as was recently pointed out ( kaiser 1999 ; kuijken 1999 ) , the ksb method has several shortcomings which limit its validity and accuracy .",
    "first , the method requires a decomposition of the psf into the convolution of an isotropic part and a compact anisotropic part . for most",
    "psfs encountered in practice , this decomposition is formally ill - defined and the anisotropic part is not necessarily sufficiently compact .",
    "another problem results from the fact that most psfs do not fall off fast enough for the second moments ( and higher moments ) to converge .",
    "consequently , the weighted second moments of the psf depend strongly on the size of the window function .",
    "these problems are particularly severe for the psf of hst which has broad wings extending beyond a central core , and thus cast doubts on the validity of the numerous weak - lensing analyses based on hst observations .",
    "since our method is based on the same principles as that of the ksb method , it also suffers from the same shortcomings .",
    "in addition , we have made the further assumption that , in the decomposition of the psf , the isotropic part can be taken to be a gaussian ( see  [ psf_decomposition ] ) .",
    "this has the advantage of greatly simplifying the deconvolution , but can arguably produce further inaccuracies .",
    "these problems are certainly worrisome , and might eventually be solved by considering different methods such as those proposed by kaiser ( 1999 ) and kuijken ( 1999 ) . however , the ksb approach has the advantage of being relatively simple and of requiring only a small amount of information about the psf and galaxy shapes , namely the first few multipole moments .",
    "moreover , these shortcomings are mainly formal in nature . in practice ,",
    "one indeed always measures moments with a weight function width that is close to the width of the central core of the psf , and which therefore do not diverge .",
    "for instance , for the hst psf , the secondary sidelobes which compose the extended wings are smaller in amplitude than the central core by about one order of magnitude .",
    "since the central core dominates in the convolution , one therefore expects that the corrections will be approximately correct . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we describe numerical simulations designed to test this assertion quantitatively .      to test the weak link in our method , namely the psf correction",
    ", we performed a series of numerical simulations .",
    "we first generated a wfpc2 psf using the tiny tim software ( krist & hook 1997 ) .",
    "we chose the psf to be particularly non - circular by placing it at the lower - right - hand corner of chip 2 , at pixel coordinate ( 100,100 ) ( see  [ hst ] for a description of the wfpc2 camera and of its psf ) .",
    "we oversampled the psf by using pixels which are 10 times smaller than the wfpc2 pixels , and did not add any noise to the images .",
    "this isolates the systematic deconvolution errors from the random errors produced by pixelization and noise . to maintain uniformity",
    ", we will nevertheless quote angular sizes in wfpc2 pixels .",

    "fo the rest of the simulations , we set @xmath229 pixels , which is the stellar weight width that we used in our analysis of the survey strip ( see  [ w_choice ] ) .",
    "we then convolved the psf with elliptical gaussian `` galaxies '' of various intrinsic sizes @xmath55 and ellipticities @xmath20 . since the source of the problem lies with the psf shape , this simplified galaxy model is sufficient for our purposes .",

    "this does not alleviate the serious formal shortcomings of the method , and the need for a search for more robust methods ( see kaiser ( 1999 ) ; kuijken ( 1999 ) ) .",

    "however , an object was included in the final catalog only if both the i and v images had a detection within an error box of approximately 5 pixels ( 0.5 arcsec ) .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 9448 galaxies with @xmath288 .",
    "the moments of the galaxies were calculated as described above ( eq .  [ [ eq : jij_def ] ] ) .",
    "the variable weight function was chosen to be @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is the detection area calculated by focas .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath8 was chosen to match the width @xmath12 used for stars .",
    "[ w_choice ]    the importance of the camera distortion and of the psf depends on the radius @xmath55 of the galaxy ( eq .  [ [ eq : d_def ] ] ) .",
    "we thus considered subsamples of small and large galaxies , with @xmath291 pixels and @xmath292 pixels respectively . here",
    "@xmath293 is the root mean squared observed radius ( eq .  [ [ eq : d_obs ] ] ) and @xmath283 pixels is the psf radius ( see  [ psf_radius ] ) .",
    "because of the noise , a fraction of the galaxies have unphysical ellipticity values ( @xmath294 ) . because these outliers would dominate ellipticity statistics , we only retained galaxies with @xmath254 .",
    "the mean observed radius and reduction factor ( eq .  [ [ eq : fd ] ] )",
    "are @xmath295 pixels and @xmath296 , and @xmath297 pixels and @xmath298 , for the small and large galaxies , respectively .",
    "each subsample respectively comprises 41% and 77% of the total number of @xmath288 galaxies .",
    "the ellipticity profile for each subsample is shown as a solid line in figures  [ fig : er_small ] and [ fig : er_large ] .",
    "also shown are the asymptotic cases , namely the combined m4/ngc6572 stars ( @xmath225 ) , and the camera distortion ellipticity ( @xmath299 ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the prediction of the simplified model described in  [ comb ] ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : comb ] ] ) .",
    "the small galaxy sample shows a tangential ellipticity which increases with radius from the chip center , in agreement with the model prediction .",
    "the large galaxies , on the other hand , do not display any significant tangential ellipticity , again in agreement with the model . in both cases , @xmath300 is consistent with zero .    using the camera distortion matrix derived in  [ hst_distortion ] and the psf moments derived in  [ hst_psf ] , we then corrected the strip galaxies .",
    "the ellipticity profiles at different stages of the correction for the small and large galaxy subsamples are shown in figures  [ fig : correction_small ] and [ fig : correction_large ] . since the camera distortion is radial , its correction increases the tangential ellipticity of the galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the correction for the psf , which is mainly tangential , reduces the tangential component of the ellipticity . for both subsamples ,",
    "the resulting corrected profile is consistent with 0 .",
    "as expected , the psf correction has a smaller effect on the large galaxies than on the small galaxies .",
    "the effect of the corrections for the chip - averaged ellipticities are summarized in table  [ tab : stats ] . to ensure statistical independence",
    ", we considered in this table a subsample of large galaxies with @xmath301 pixels ( and @xmath254 ) .",
    "this subsample contains 51% of the total number of galaxies with @xmath288 , corresponding to a surface density of @xmath302 arcmin@xmath303 .",
    "their mean observed radius is @xmath304 pixels , corresponding to a post - deconvolution reduction factor of @xmath305 ( eq .  [ [ eq : fd_deconv ] ] ) . as a test of the correction algorithm",
    ", we also corrected the globular cluster stars , exactly as we corrected the galaxies .",
    "( we have not corrected either the stars or the small galaxies for the isotropic psf , as this would produce diverging ellipticities ) .",
    "the results for the corrected stars are also shown in the table .",
    "the self - corrected m4/ngc6572 stars have a residual ellipticity of @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "this is a measure of the errors resulting from the approximations in our correction method and from the fit to the stellar moments .",
    "another estimation of the errors from the method was presented in  [ validity ] . by performing numerical simulations",
    ", we showed that the residual ellipticity errors in the psf correction was 0.004 , after averaging over a galaxy ensemble with @xmath243 pixels .",
    "given the agreement of these two estimates , we take the error in the correction method to be about 0.004 .    as we noted in ",
    "[ hst_psf ] , the m4 and ngc6572 ellipticities differ by about 0.01 for both rotated and absolute ellipticities . after the anisotropic psf correction ,",
    "the small galaxies have a residual ellipticity of @xmath308 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "since the small galaxies have a reduction factor of @xmath296 , their residual @xmath311 ellipticity indicates that the psf variation is about 0.02 , which is larger than that given by the comparison of m4/ngc6572 .",
    "we therefore take the variations of the chip - average psf ellipticity to be about 0.02 .",
    "how does this uncertainty affect the ellipticities of the large galaxies ?",
    "as noted above , the post - deconvolution reduction factor for the large galaxies ( with @xmath301 pixels ) is @xmath312 .",
    "consequently , our uncertainty of 0.02 in the psf ellipticity produces an uncertainty in the ellipticities of the large galaxies of only 0.003 .",
    "this is of course a commendable consequence of the small size of the wfpc2 psf .",
    "note also that , for the large galaxies , the camera distortion correction is about the same size as that for the psf , so that the two corrections almost cancel each other .",
    "the changes in ellipticities produced by each of these corrections is less than 0.005 for the large galaxies .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty is a combination of the correction uncertainty and of the psf variability , and is thus about @xmath313 .",
    "the statistical uncertainties are determined by the ellipticity variance @xmath314 . both noise in the image and",
    "the intrinsic shapes of the galaxies contribute to this dispersion .",
    "the _ rms _ ellipticity @xmath258 is listed in the last column of table  [ tab : stats ] , at various stages of the correction .",
    "for both the large and small galaxies , @xmath258 does not increase when we correct for the camera distortion and for the anisotropic psf .",
    "this shows that our correction method does not introduce any appreciable noise in the ellipticity measurements .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath258 increases moderately when we correct for the isotropic psf .",
    "this is expected since this deconvolution reduces the galaxy size , and thus reduces the denominator in the definition of the ellipticity .",
    "for the large galaxies , the _ rms _ ellipticity after all corrections is about @xmath315 .",
    "since the mean number of such galaxies per chip is about @xmath316 , the @xmath317 sensitivity to detect the shear in a chip is @xmath318 .",
    "this is close to the expected _ rms _ shear expected from weak lensing by large - scale structure in 1.3 arcmin cells , for cluster normalized cdm models and for a source redshift @xmath319 ( jain & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "this shows that the expected signal - to - noise ratio of a single wfpc2 chip is about 1 .",
    "we have revisited the ksb method to measure the weak lensing shear from the shapes of galaxies . in our method , the corrections for the camera distortion and psf convolution are performed using moments rather than ellipticities . using a gaussian weight function , we derived explicit expressions for the corrections , which involve only second and fourth order moments .",
    "we clarified the convergence of some of the approximations made by ksb , and showed how the weight function for stars can be chosen to be different from that for galaxies .",
    "we also showed how the isotropic part of the psf can be assumed to be a gaussian , to the required level of precision , and can thus be corrected for exactly .",
    "we derived the explicit relation between the shear and the ellipticities by decomposing moments into tensors with definite rotational properties .",
    "we addressed the recently exposed shortcomings of the ksb method ( kaiser 1999 ; kuijken 1999 ) .",
    "our method , as well as the ksb method , has formal problems arising from the fact that psfs encountered in practice are not sufficiently compact .",
    "we used numerical simulations to assess the importance of these problems in the analysis of wfpc2 images .",
    "we found that the ellipticity error produced by the psf correction can be of several percent for an individual galaxy .",
    "however , it is only about 0.004 when averaged over a galaxy ensemble with @xmath243 pixels , provided moderate weight function widths are used .",
    "we studied systematic effects arising in wfpc2 images . from globular cluster observations ,",
    "we confirm the results of hfks , who found @xmath32010% psf ellipticities at the edge of each chip .",
    "we find however that the camera distortion is radial , rather than tangential .",
    "it produces ellipticities of the order of 0.7% .",
    "we further find that the psf ellipticity varies by as much as 2% over time .",
    "we applied our correction method to the hst survey strip .",
    "we showed that the different stages of our correction do not introduce any appreciable noise .",
    "we studied the dependence of galaxy ellipticities on the galaxy size .",
    "small galaxies are more sensitive to the psf and also indicate that the psf varies with time . for large galaxies ( observed radii @xmath301 pixels ) , the total systematic uncertainty is about 0.4% , and results from a nearly equal contribution from the correction uncertainty and from the psf variability .",
    "the statistical @xmath317 uncertainty in measuring the shear in a single wfpc2 @xmath321 square arcmin chip is about 4% , for this subsample of galaxies .",
    "this provides good prospects for detecting a cosmic shear signal with the strip and other deep hst surveys . in rhodes",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) and rhodes ( 1999 ) , we will describe our search for such a signal .",
