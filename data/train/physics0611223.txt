    "at low to moderate freestream disturbance levels , the first step in the process of transition to turbulence in a is that at some streamwise location , the laminar flow becomes unstable to linear disturbances .",
    "while this instability and the events that follow have been investigated in great detail for two - dimensional boundary layers during the past century , much less work has been done on its axisymmetric counterpart , the incompressible in the flow past a cylinder , notable exceptions being the early and approximate linear stability analysis of rao@xcite and the more recent and accurate one of tutty et .",
    "in rao s work , the equations were not solved directly and the stability estimates had severe limitations .",
    "al.@xcite showed that non - axisymmetric modes are less stable than axisymmetric ones .",
    "the critical reynolds number was found to be @xmath5 for the @xmath6 mode and @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the instability is thus of a different character from that in two - dimensional boundary layers , since squire s ( 1933 ) theorem , stating that the first instabilities are two - dimensional , is not applicable in this case .",
    "the expected next stage of the process of transition to turbulence , namely the secondary modes of instability , have not been studied before , to our knowledge , although the turbulent flow over a long thin cylinder has been studied by tutty @xcite , who computed the meanflow quantities to within experimental accuracy .",
    "practical applications , on the other hand , are numerous .",
    "for example , the axial extent of turbulent flow would determine the signature that submarines leave behind themselves , apart from the drag .",
    "the transition to turbulence over the bodies of large fish too would be partially controlled by transverse curvature .",
    "the secondary instability of incompressible laminar flow past an axisymmetric body is thus the focus of this paper .",
    "we present results only for the flow past a cylinder , but the equations derived here and the solution method can be used for arbitrary axisymmetric bodies .",
    "we show that the overall effect of transverse curvature on incompressible boundary layers is to stabilise secondary disturbances .",
    "remarkably no instability is found at any reynolds number at higher curvatures , i.e. , when the boundary layer thickness becomes comparable to the body radius .",
    "this implies that the boundary layer past a thin cylinder would tend to remain laminar , or to relaminarise downstream even were it to go turbulent .",
    "we note in contrast that longitudinal curvature , and the resulting grtler ( 1940 ) vortices on concave walls , have been well studied ( see e.g. benmalek and saric @xcite ) and so have instabilities in three - dimensional boundary layers due to streamline curvature @xcite .",
    "the unperturbed laminar flow is obtained by solving the incompressible steady boundary layer equation for the axial component of velocity :        uu x + v u r = ( u r + 1 ru r ) , [ eq : mean ] together with the continuity equation u x + v r + v r=0 , [ eqn : cont ] and the boundary conditions u(0,r)=1 , u(x,1)=0 , v(x,1)= 0 u(x,)=1 .",
