    "as advances in technology push the size of the electronic components towards the nanometer scale , the well - established technology of micorelectromechanical systems ( mems ) begins to acquire quantum features .",
    "this trend signals the birth of a new research field , nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) . despite of the infancy of nems , a large literature is already available on it , and for a broad overview the interested reader",
    "is referred to recent review articles @xcite .",
    "the review at hand has a more restricted scope : it is devoted to a theoretical analysis of a very specific nems device , the electron shuttle . by presenting a detailed study of such an idealized model system",
    "we hope to be able to illustrate the basic physics and conceptual problems that need to be understood before a general theory of nems can be developed .    the electron shuttle , originally introduced by gorelik _",
    "_ in 1998@xcite , consists of a movable nanoscopic grain which is coupled via tunnel barriers to source and drain electrodes . a subtle combination of quantum transport and the mechanical degrees of freedom play an essential role for the functionality of the device .",
    "the device can exhibit a  phase transition \" : when a control parameter is tuned ( this could be the damping of the oscillator ) , at a certain threshold value the system enters a new transport regime , the shuttle regime , where charge is transported in an orderly fashion ( i.e. essentially a fixed number charges per mechanical oscillation cycle ) .",
    "( this phenomenon is particularly pronounced if the device operates in the strong coulomb blockade regime , when only one excess charge at a time is allowed in the movable part . ) in the original suggestion of ref .",
    "the motion of the movable grain was treated macroscopically , i.e. , with newton s equation of motion . in our group we have been asking questions of what happens when the movable body is so light that also its motion becomes quantized . for example , does the shuttle transition persist in the quantum regime ?",
    "another interesting question concerns the interpretation of measurements of nems devices , possibly exhibiting shuttling .",
    "as it turns out , a measurement of the stationary iv - characteristics does not always yield enough information to uniquely identify the underlying microscopic charge transport mechanism . a point in case",
    "is the c@xmath0 set experiment by park et al.@xcite where two alternative interpretations , namely incoherent phonon assisted tunneling@xcite or shuttling,@xcite are plausible .",
    "the _ current noise _ provides another important characteristics , supplementary to the mean current.@xcite the fano factor which characterizes the degree of correlation between charge transport events is a powerful diagnostic tool to distinguish between various transport mechanisms .",
    "therefore , studies of the current noise in nems have become an active field of research.@xcite based on studies where the mechanical system is treated classically , one expects a giant enhancement of noise at the shuttling transition @xcite , and we want to investigate whether this also occurs in the quantum case .",
    "one can go even further along this line : why stop at the current noise , which is the second cumulant of the _ full counting statics _",
    "surely fcs ( which equals the probability @xmath1 of @xmath2 electrons being collected , say , in the right lead at time @xmath3 ) will contain even more detailed information .",
    "consequently , fcs in mesoscopic devices has been a very active research field for some time now , and its importance and relevance have been underlined by a recent _ measurement _ of the third cumulant @xcite .",
    "thus , fcs for nems is obviously an interesting issue .",
    "we are aware of a recent calculation for a classical , driven shuttle @xcite , and at the end of this paper we illustrate some of our own very recent generalizations of these concepts to the quantum regime using a simple example ; a full description will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have investigated quantum shuttles in several recent papers , @xcite where the full technical details can be found ; the purpose of the present paper is to introduce some of the basic issues to a more general reader .",
    "several other groups have also recently studied quantum shuttles , see e.g. refs . .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the models of quantum shuttles employed in our work .",
    "the total hamiltonian consisting of the  system \" ( both mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom of the quantum dot array ) , the leads , and a generic heat bath is used to illustrate the derivation of a markovian generalized master equation ( gme ) which is the starting point of the theoretical analysis . along the way from the hamiltonian to the generalized master equation we identify the necessary assumptions , and point out several issues of potential importance not addressed so far within the field of nems .    in section 3",
    "we discuss the calculation of the current and the zero - frequency component of the current noise spectrum for a nems device described by a gme .",
    "we also give a qualitative discussion of the required numerical calculations , which are highly non - trivial due to the large dimensions of the involved matrices .",
    "finally , some examples of our numerical results are displayed .",
    "section 4 is devoted to an elementary discussion of the calculation of the full counting statistics , and a brief review of the experimental status .",
    "at least two model systems have been considered in the literature .",
    "@xcite considered a single movable quantum dot , while armour and mackinnon @xcite introduced a model of a three - dot array whose central dot is movable , see fig.[setup ] .",
    "both of these systems are of intrinsic interest and may find applications in real systems . the quantum system is assumed to be in the strong coulomb blockade regime in which only none or one extra ( spinless ) electron in the whole system are allowed .",
    "thus , in the one - dot case the electronic states are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , while in the triple - dot case we have @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the quantum system is coupled to two leads with a high bias applied between them .",
    "the bias is smaller than the charging energy for addition or removal of other electrons but otherwise it is the largest energy scale in the model .",
    "the moving dot interacts with its surroundings and its dissipative dynamics is described by the interaction with a generic heat bath .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 describes the mechanical center - of - mass motion of the central dot as a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath10 and frequency @xmath11 .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the nonlinear dependence of @xmath12 on the oscillator degree of freedom ; the @xmath13-dependence is often exponential which lies at the heart of the shuttling instability .",
    "we refer to the literature for explicit expressions for the other terms appearing in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) @xcite .",
    "the leads are held at different electrochemical potentials @xmath14 whose difference gives the bias across the array ( see fig .",
    "( [ setup ] ) ) .",
    "we assume that the tunneling densities of states are independent of energy .",
    "this is necessary for the _ first markov approximation_,@xcite used later on , to hold .",
    "further , as already implied above , we assume @xmath15 .",
    "these assumptions are necessary for the derivation of the markovian dynamics of the movable system . finally ,",
    "the heat bath consisting of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to the mechanical degree of freedom is described with the caldeira - leggett model@xcite in its ohmic form .      for the description of the model we use the language of quantum dissipative systems.@xcite as the  system \" ( or  device \" ) we take the electronic states plus the one - dimensional oscillator describing the center - of - mass motion of the central dot .",
    "the electronic leads and the heat bath interacting with the mechanical degree of freedom constitute the reservoirs .",
    "the task is to integrate out the degrees of freedom of the reservoirs to end up with an equation of motion for the system density operator .",
    "the derivation proceeds in two steps first integrating out the leads and then the heat bath in the weak coupling limit to get the desired gme for the system density operator .",
    "we remark that the assumed additivity of the two heat baths should be proven , however we are not aware of any such proof .    as a specific example of an end result of this procedure , we give the gme governing the system density operator in the one - dot case , written here in a liouvillean form : @xmath16 \\ , \\\\",

    "the method of solving this vast numerical task is commented on below .",
    "let us next consider the calculation of noise . in",
    "quantum optics one often resorts to a result known as the quantum regression theorem ; this allows the calculation of any multi - time correlation function of _ system operators_. unfortunately , in nems this theorem can be applied only under very restricted circumstances : it _ can _ be used to calculate the noise ( which is essentially the average of a product of current operators ) _ within _ the three - dot device@xcite ( because the current operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 operate within the  system \" ) , while it is unapplicable for the single - dot case ( and many other nems systems as well ) because there the current operators involve operators belonging both to the baths ( i.e. , the electronic leads ) and the system .",

    "we find @xmath35 , i.e. one recovers the stationary current found above . in a similar fashion , @xmath36 $ ] , whose large - time asymptotics determines the shot noise according to ( [ macdonald ] ) .",
    "we have developed a generating function technique in ref . to extract this large - time limit .",
    "here we skip the technical details ; the upshot is that the zero - frequency noise , and thereby the fano factor @xmath37 , can be expressed in terms of the pseudoinverse of the liouvillean ( and the static limit of the density matrix known already from the current calculation ) : @xmath38_{11}\\right)\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is a projection operator that projects away from the stationary state , for which the liouvillean has the eigenvalue zero .",
    "the crucial point is that the pseudoinverse @xmath40 of the liouvillean , defined as @xmath41 is tractable by similar numerical methods as used in the evaluation of the current . in our discussion of the full counting statistics given below , we analyze a toy - model to illustrate some properties of the pseudoinverse @xmath40 .",
    "as mentioned above , the superoperator structure of the liouville equation leads to large matrices of the order of @xmath42 , where @xmath24 is the number of low - energy states kept in the calculation .",
    "a further complication arises from the fact that the stationary limit corresponds to the zero eigenvalue of the liouvillean , @xmath43 , forcing one to deal with singular matrices .",
    "the problems with the memory size can be circumvented by using iterative methods in which only @xmath44 for a given @xmath45 is needed ( @xmath46 numbers ) , and one avoids the storage of the full @xmath47 ( @xmath48 numbers ) . using an iterative method raises the questions of convergence , and the speed of convergence .",
    "we found that the so - called arnoldi iteration technique was sufficient for our purposes ( see appendix a in ref . ) , provided that one uses a suitable preconditioning .",
    "while there exists a substantial empirical body of knowledge of how to carry out the preconditioning , we are not aware of a complete algorithm .",
    "as an example , when solving for the pseudoinverse @xmath40 , we used the inverse of the  sylvester part \" @xmath49 of @xmath47 as preconditioner@xcite ; finding the inverse of @xmath49 is a relatively fast procedure .",
    "when calculating the noise ( which amounts to solving an equation of the type @xmath50 , where the vector @xmath51 belongs in the range of @xmath47 ) , we used the generalized minimum residual method ( gmres)@xcite . again , appropriate preconditioning was crucial .",
    "figure [ fig2prl03 ] shows a set of current vs. damping curves for the single - dot shuttle .",
    "we draw attention to the following features . as damping",
    "is decreased , the current increases , approaching asymptotically the value @xmath52 , i.e. one electron is transferred per cycle . in other words ,",
    "this value of the current indicates that the shuttling transition has taken place , even in the quantum regime .",
    "the transition is not as sharp as found in the classical case@xcite . for large values of damping",
    "the current is much smaller , and scales with the tunneling rate @xmath53 .",
    "very interestingly , we see a sharp increase in the current even without electric field , @xmath54 .",
    "classically this does not happen , and therefore we interpret this cross - over of being due to quantum shot noise .",
    "we have in several occasions promoted the use of wigner functions as an interpretative tool for the numerical results obtained for the stationary density matrix .",
    "the wigner representation of the gme has also turned out to be a useful starting point for further analytic work@xcite .",
    "these phase - space representations have a simple form in the classical limit : the wigner representation of a regularly moving harmonic oscillator is an ellipse . on the other hand , irregular motion under the influence of external noise gives rise to a gaussian probability distribution centered at the origin . the _ charge resolved _ wigner functions ( @xmath55 corresponds to an empty dot , while @xmath56 represents the occupied dot ) are defined as    @xmath57    and some representative results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1prl03 ] . as expected , as damping",
    "is decreased , the fuzzy central spot evolves into a ring .",
    "the finite thickness of the ring is due to thermal noise , the randomness of the charge transport processes , and the position  momentum uncertainty .",
    "the earmark of shuttling are the asymmetric , banana - shaped areas observed for weakest damping : here one observes a strong correlation between the occupancy of the dot , and the position and momentum .",
    "thus , there is a large probability to have an occupied dot with a negative position coordinate and positive velocity ( the dot has been filled in the neighborhood of the left contact ) , while there is a large probability of having an empty dot at positive @xmath58-values and negative velocity , i.e. on the return journey from the right contact .",
    " as the system approaches the classical limit , the thickness of the wigner ring shrinks ; this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ wignerquantclass ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we expect that the noise of the quantum shuttle yields additional information about the nature of the charge transfer process .",
    "figure [ fano_fig ] shows some of our numerical results . in the top panel",
    "we see a relatively sharp cross - over if the tunneling length is larger than the length scale @xmath59 , i.e. as one aproaches the classical limit . in the bottom panel",
    "we show the fano factor for the same parameters as in the top panel .",
    "one should note that a logarithmic scale is used , thus one observes ( i ) a huge enhancement at the tunneling cross - over , in particular for parameters approaching the semiclassical limit , and ( ii ) tiny fano factors below the shuttling cross - over .",
    "thus , even well in the quantum regime shuttling is a highly ordered charge transfer process .",
    "figure [ fig2-prl04 ] shows the phase - space plot for the parameter values indicated by the asterisk in fig .",
    "[ fano_fig ] .",
    "the interpretation is very suggestive : for these parameters tunneling and shuttling _ co - exist_. our numerics thus confirm the suggestion put forward in the analytical study of ref . .",
    "the large value of the fano factor can be understood as a slow switching process between the two possible current channels ( tunneling and shuttling ) . in the next section we elaborate this point further .",
    "we begin by introducing some notation .",
    "we recall that the liouvillean , which is a non - hermitian operator , has a single eigenvalue equal to zero with @xmath60 being the corresponding ( normalized and unique ) right eigenvector , we denote this eigenvector by @xmath61 . the corresponding left eigenvector is the identity operator @xmath62 which we denote by @xmath63 , and we have @xmath64 .",
    "the pair of eigenvectors allows us to define the complementary projectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 obeying the relations @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we will also need the pseudoinverse of the liouvillean @xmath69 , which is well - defined , since the inversion is performed only in the subspace spanned by @xmath39 , where @xmath47 is regular . rather than attempting to calculate the complete probability distribution @xmath70 $ ] directly",
    ", it turns out to be easier to evaluate the cumulant generating function @xmath71 , @xmath72 from @xmath71 we find the @xmath10th cumulant of the charge distribution by taking the @xmath10-th derivative with respect to the counting field @xmath73 at @xmath74 : @xmath75 and from the knowledge of all cumulants we can reconstruct @xmath1 .",
    "the cumulants of the current in the stationary limit @xmath76 are given by the time derivative of the charge cumulants : @xmath77 the first two current cumulants give the average current running through the system and the zero - frequency current noise , respectively .",
    "we have recently developed a systematic perturbation theory to calculate the higher cumulants@xcite , and we just quote the final results :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 the explicit expressions for the current superoperators @xmath80 depend on the problem at hand ; two examples are given in ref .",
    "( see also the analytic toy model discussed below ) .",
    "we emphasize the utility of these formulae : they imply that once the hard numerical problems with the stationary case are solved , the higher cumulants are essentially immediately accessible . using the systematic perturbation theory developed in ref .",
    "algebraic formulas for the fourth , fifth etc .",
    "cumulant can be generated with computer routines performing symbolic manipulations . in fig .",
    "[ thirdcumulant ] we show numerical results for the first three cumlants for the single - dot shuttle .",
    "the general formulation for calculation of higher cumulants given above is very practical also in analytic calculations .",
    "here we illustrate it by considering a toy model , for which the current and noise are very well - known , while the third cumulant can not be considered as a standard result .",
    "specifically , we consider a two level system , whose occupation probabilities obey the master equation ( @xmath81 ) @xmath82 the relevance of this model to the shuttling dynamics is based on the fact that in the co - existence regime there are two  states \" : the incoherent tunneling current channel ( reflected by the central spot in the wigner function description ) , and the orderly shuttling channel ( reflected ) by the ring , and that the system can be visualized as fluctuating between these two states .",
    "the bare two - level system , as discussed in this section , needs a slight modification to take into account that in the coexistence regime one deals with _ current channels _ and not states , and further discussion can be found in ref .",
    ", see also ref . for a related model .",
    "the liouvillean of eq .",
    "( [ 2-level ] ) has the following right and left null vectors : @xmath83 which satisfy @xmath84 and @xmath85 , as is readily verified .",
    "we can immediately form the projectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 : @xmath88 we also record the current superoperator : @xmath89 next , we need the eigenvector @xmath90 of @xmath91 which does not belong to the null space ( here , the situation is quite simple because the full problem is 2-dimensional with a 1-dimensional null space ) , and the associated eigenvalue @xmath92 .",
    "we readily find @xmath93 and can thus compute the pseudoinverse @xmath94 : @xmath95 with these results at hand , the evaluation of various cumulants is reduced to simple matrix multiplications , and we quote the results @xmath96 the first two results are well - known from the literature ( see , e.g. , ref . ) , however the third cumulant may be new .",
    "we believe that the above method of calculation can be very useful in extending several previous results , such as those obtained in by kielich et al.@xcite .      to summarize the experimental status very shortly",
    ", we do not believe that the shuttling transition has been observed so far .",
    "having stated this negative conclusion , we hasten to point out that we think that the experimental situation is very promising , and that a crucial experiment could be just behind the corner .",
    "two key experiments have been reported , which contain several important ingredients . in the experiment of park _",
    "et al._@xcite a @xmath97 molecule was placed in a break junction , and the current - voltage characteristics showed clear indications of effects due to vibrational quanta .",
    "we believe that the observed values of the current are too small to be attributed to shuttling ( recall that the shuttling current has the universal value of @xmath98 ) , and that the system is in the tunneling limit . in the experiment of erbe _",
    "et al._@xcite the system was driven : indeed electrons were shuttled , but the experiment was not designed to observe the shuttling transition as a function of a control parameter .",
    "our optimism is based on a number of new structures that are currently being explored in the literature , and in particular we find the structures of scheible _",
