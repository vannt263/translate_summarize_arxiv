    "the apparent magnitude distribution of red clump ( rc ) stars toward galactic bulge sightlines that are at least @xmath3 degrees apart from the plane is bimodal @xcite , an artefact of an excess in the orbital distribution of bulge stars that would appear x - shaped if the galactic bar were viewed side - on @xcite .",
    "given that the class of orbits that contributes to this morphology , predominantly trapped by the x1 tree of families , is sharply sensitive to the galactic gravitational potential @xcite , and that the kinematics of bulge stars have been shown to be correlated to metallicity , mapping how the strength and extent of the x - shape correlates with metallicity could constrain formation and evolution models of the galaxy .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ stars supporting the x - shape would primarily be disc stars , the latest ones captured into resonance that were in the mid - plane prior to their capture into resonance . as they were all disc stars",
    ", they should have similar metallicity and that typical of the disc just exterior to resonance - @xcite . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    such a prediction can only be compared to observations that include both metallicity and kinematic information , thus requiring an accounting of the systematics thereof .    in that regard , we identify four claims linking the x - shaped morphology of high - latitude bulge stars to metallicity .",
    "@xcite used a combination of spectroscopic and photometric data along the bulge minor axis to argue that the x - shape is stronger for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath4 than for stars with @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 , with the x - shaped morphology disappearing among stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath7 .",
    "independently argued , also by means of a combination of spectroscopic and photometric data , that stars with metallicity [ m / h ] @xmath8 do not show the split red clump , in contrast to stars with [ m / h ] @xmath9 .",
    "this demarcation has also been recently argued in separate conference presentations by manuela zoccali and alvaro rojas - arriagada to be confirmed by data from the gaia - eso survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that bulge rr lyrae stars ( with a mean metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath10 , see @xcite ) are distributed as a spheroid , and not as a bar , unlike the more metal - rich rc stars .",
    "the combination of these four works suggests an open - and - shut case : the x - shape of the galactic bulge is most prominent among the most metal - rich stars , progressively becoming weaker with decreasing metallicity , disappearing entirely for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath7 .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is neither to confirm nor refute this claim , but to argue for further diligence in treating systematics that emerge due to the convolution of stellar physics with galactic dynamics , this convolution being that which is ultimately observable .",
    "we use a combination of stellar and dynamical models ( discussed in section [ sec : models ] ) to show that even if the x - shape were uniformly prominent among stars of all metallicities , it would still appear more prominent with increasing metallicity due to a combination of up to three factors .",
    "these are the metallicity - dependence of the colour of the rc ( section [ sec : systematic1 ] ) , the increase in the ratio of rc to red giant ( rg ) stars with increasing metallicity ( section [ sec : systematic2 ] ) , and the effect of the red giant branch bump ( rgbb ) ( section [ sec : systematic3 ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : predictedluminosityparameters ]",
    "the stellar isochrones and luminosity functions used in this work are predominantly taken from the basti stellar databasehttp://albione.oa - teramo.inaf.it ] .",
    "the models assume a scaled - solar abundance mixture without overshooting , and include both the first @xcite and second @xcite ascent of the rg branch , hereafter respectively referred to as the rgb and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "additional models with enhanced helium - enrichment ( @xmath11 ) that assume otherwise identical physics to those downloaded from basti database have been computed specifically for this work .",
    "the predicted parameters of the combined rg , rc , and agb luminosity function are listed in table [ table : predictedluminosityparameters ] .",
    "the n - body model used in this work has been made by @xcite and used by @xcite , where the latter estimated a scale factor between model distance units and kpc of 1.2 as optimal to interpret galactic kinematics data .",
    "the model is initialised as an isolated , axisymmetric galaxy with a live disk and halo component , with the disk stars having an exponential distribution in the radial direction .",
    "the bar grows from the disk and part of it buckles to form an x - shaped structure ( for a review of the process , see @xcite ) .",
    "we evaluate the model in the same evolutionary state as @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance between the sun and the galactic centre of 8.13 kpc , and a viewing angle between the major axis of the galactic bar and the line of sight between the sun and the galactic centre of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the first systematic bias that we quantify arises from the fact that the rgb is redder than the rc at fixed metallicity and luminosity ( @xmath13 mag ) and that both become bluer with decreasing metallicity , at a rate of @xmath0 } \\approx 0.25 $ ] mag dex@xmath1  see figure [ fig : bastiisochronefigure ] and table [ table : predictedluminosityparameters ] .",
    "this means that the ratio of rc stars to rg stars will be a metallicity - dependent function of the colour - cut used by any given survey , modifying the diagnostic power of a sample to resolve the distance distribution function .",
    "that is because unlike rc stars , rg stars have an intrinsic luminosity function dispersed over @xmath24 magnitudes , and are thus much less suitable to distance determinations .    reviewing the potential impact of this effect on current results :    * @xcite use a colour - cut of @xmath14 ( corresponding to @xmath15 0.65 ) , and as such should have neutrally - sampled the bulk ( @xmath16% ) of bulge rc and rg stars , given the assumption that their stellar evolution is adequately predicted by the models used in this work ; * use a selection that imposes an effective colour - cut at the rc of @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "this will have the effect of decreasing the ratio of rc to rg stars at the metal - poor end , and increasing it at the metal - rich end .",
    "indeed reports more prominent rcs for [ m / h ] @xmath9 than for [ m / h ] @xmath19 ;    we note that the model predictions stated in table [ table : predictedluminosityparameters ] may be overestimating the colour of metal - poor horizontal branch stars in the bulge . the galactic bulge rr lyrae ( ab type ) population has a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath20 @xcite , which indicates that metal - poor horizontal branch stars in the bulge may be bluer than predicted by a whopping @xmath21 mag . galactic bulge globular clusters are also known to have horizontal branches that are very blue for their metallicities .",
    "@xcite argues that the colour of huge metal - poor horizontal branch stars indicates an old bulge , though we find that an unphysical age of @xmath22 gyr is needed to produce an rrab morphology for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath23 if one assumes standard stellar physics .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the mass - loss is greater - than - expected for low - metallicity rg stars in the bulge , leading to a bluer horizontal branch morphology .",
    "alternatively , the helium - abundance of these stars might be higher than expected .",
    "until this discrepancy has been explained , it will not be possible to quantify selection biases for low - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath24 ) bulge horizontal branch stars .",
    "^ t@xmath25 gyr isochrones of metallicities [ m / h]@xmath26 @xcite over plotted on a dereddened @xmath27 galactic bulge colour - magnitude diagram toward the ogle - iii field blg16 @xcite , centred on @xmath28 .",
    "we assume a distance modulus of @xmath29 for the overplotting of the isochrones .",
    "the metallicity distribution function of any bulge sample as well as the ratio of red clump stars to red giant stars will clearly be a sensitive function of the colour selection . ]    in addition , the referee directs us to a curious discrepancy shown in figure 20 of , where synthetic modelling of the bulge luminosity function predicts a mean rc colour that is @xmath20.1 mag bluer in @xmath30 than the rgb at the same apparent magnitude in @xmath31 , whereas there no such offset in the observed cmd .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that it will be difficult to model the selection effects .",
    "we agree that this is a cause for concern that would benefit from further investigation .",
    "we argue that it is likely due to errors at higher metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath32 0 ) , where each of stellar mass - loss along the red giant branch , colour - temperature relations , and spectroscopic model atmospheres are more theoretically uncertain , as well as the fact that the age and helium abundance of the bulge are empirically uncertain at higher metallicities .",
    "we think it is unlikely that this is an issue at lower metallicities .",
    "the same theoretical framework adopted in present investigation appears fully appropriate to describe the rc morphology of stars in the solar neighbourhood as investigated with the hipparcos satellite @xcite and the horizontal branch morphology of metal - poor galactic globular clusters ( see , for instance , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "separately , figure 20 of also shows an excess in observations relative to predictions in the number of horizontal branch stars bluer than the rc , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "higher metallicity has the effect of decreasing the duration of the rgb , and of increasing the lifetime of the core helium - burning phase ( see discussions in , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "this means that a metal - rich sample will have a higher ratio of rc to rg+agb stars , and thus a more easily discernible distance distribution function .",
    "we parameterise this effect by measuring the equivalent width of the rc on the luminosity function in the models , @xmath33 , which is the ratio of the number of rc stars to the combined number density of rg and agb stars at the luminosity of the rc .",
    "it is similar to the parameter @xmath34 previously measured for galactic globular clusters by @xcite , though for bulge stars one can not separate the agb from the rgb , thus leading to a different normalisation  which also effects determinations of the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "we find that for a scaled - solar helium abundance and fixed age ( @xmath36 gyr ) , the equivalent width of the rc rises from @xmath37 at [ m / h]@xmath381.27 to @xmath39 at [ m / h]@xmath40 , and finally to @xmath41 at [ m / h]@xmath420.40 .",
    "thus , the ratio of rc to rgb+agb stars rises by @xmath233% as the metallicity increases from [ m / h]@xmath43 to [ m / h]@xmath44 .",
    "in other words , in the limiting case of metallicity and kinematics being uncorrelated , a sample of bulge stars with [ m / h]@xmath43 at the apparent luminosity of the rc would need to be @xmath45 larger than the corresponding sample of stars with [ m / h]@xmath44 ( since statistical significance typically scales as the square root of the number of data points ) , in order to measure features such as the bimodality in the distance distribution function with comparable statistical significance , all other factors being equal ( which they re not , see section [ sec : systematic3 ] ) .",
    "we note that the analysis of @xcite should not be affected by this bias , as their population partition included 80 stars for [ fe / h[@xmath46 , 240 stars for @xmath47[fe / h[@xmath48 , and 200 stars for [ fe / h[@xmath49  @xcite already have more stars in their metal - poor bins , due to where they set the bincenters and the fact they studied sightlines relatively far from the plane , where the mean metallicity is lower .",
    "the bias estimated by this section is in fact a lower bound , as reports in the literature argue that metal - rich bulge stars may be , on average , younger or helium - enhanced @xcite , or both younger and helium - enhanced @xcite , all of which would further increase @xmath33 at high metallicity .",
    "predicted parameters for these scenarios are listed in the lower part of table [ table : predictedluminosityparameters ] .",
    "the rc is not the only departure from an exponential continuum in the luminosity function of rg stars . during the rgb ,",
    "there is a relatively brief period where the nuclear efficiency of the hydrogen burning shell temporarily drops , leading to a corresponding decrease in the luminosity of the star , thus leading to an excess in the luminosity function called the  red giant branch bump \" ( rgbb , as before ) .",
    "the number counts and characteristic luminosity of the rgbb are a steeply sensitive function of the age , metallicity , and helium abundance of a stellar population @xcite .",
    "we describe the metallicity - dependence of the predicted parameters for the rgbb in this section , and then we demonstrate that failure to account for this component of the luminosity function will bias determinations of the distance distribution function .    fixing the age to @xmath36 gyr and the helium abundance to scaled - solar ,",
    "the predicted luminosity of the rgbb relative to the rc , @xmath50 , decreases from @xmath51 to @xmath52 as the metallicity increases from [ m / h]@xmath43 to [ m / h]@xmath44 , an impressive shift of 1.32 mag in luminosity over 1.67 dex in metallicity .",
    "in contrast , the separation in brightness between the two rcs of the galactic bulge is @xmath20.45 mag @xcite , approximately corresponding to @xmath50 for stars with metallicity [ m / h]@xmath53 .",
    "in addition to the decreasing luminosity of the rgbb , the ratio of rgbb to rc stars , @xmath54 , is predicted to increase from @xmath55 to @xmath56 over the same metallicity range .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to understand why ignoring the rgbb will thus lead one to infer distorted brightness differences between the two rcs , with the effect growing worse with increasing metallicity .",
    "the predicted parameters of the rgbb are listed in table [ table : predictedluminosityparameters ] , where we also list the corresponding parameters for the asymptotic giant branch bump ( agbb ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nbodylf ] , we convolve the distance modulus distribution for @xmath57 ( a sightline used by both @xcite and ) predicted by our n - body model ( top panel ) with intrinsic luminosity functions corresponding to four different metallicities ( [ m / h]@xmath58 , middle panels ) , and gaussian noise of @xmath59 mag to simulate the effects of photometric errors and differential extinction to produce four predicted apparent luminosity functions ( bottom panels ) .",
    "we fit the final luminosity functions using the same methodology as @xcite .",
    "if we ignore the rgbb in our fits , fitting for a split red clump leads to @xmath60 reductions of \\{14% , 33% , 61% , 74% } in the four metallicity bins relative to the @xmath60 value obtained when fitting a single rc .",
    "in other words , there is the illusion that the distance modulus distribution is more cleanly bimodal among the metal - rich stars , when in fact the increased signal partly emerges from differences in stellar evolution in this construction .",
    "this is also rather obvious simply by inspecting the bottom - four panels of figure [ fig : nbodylf ] .",
    "more simply , the rgbb of the nearer ( brighter ) component has a similar brightness to the rc of the further ( fainter ) component , which creates a misleading amplification the signal - to - noise of the fainter peak .      in order to have a purer sample of rc stars , @xcite",
    "limited their analysis to stars with @xmath61 .",
    "we simulate the effect of this selection by constructing a luminosity function whereby for each star we  measure \" @xmath62 with a gaussian error of 0.3 dex , keeping only those stars in the interval @xmath63 .",
    "we find that this will not impact the degree of rgbb contamination at high metallicities . for the @xmath36 gyr , [ m / h]@xmath64 isochrone , the value of @xmath54 increases from 29% to 30% , whereas for the @xmath36 gyr , [ m / h]@xmath65 isochrone @xmath54 decreases from 29% to 27%  both small changes , reflective of the fact that @xmath66 is typically @xmath67 at high metallicities , and thus within the measurement error of @xmath68 .",
    "the observational fact that this selection improved the clarity of the sample ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) is more likely due to it decreasing the rate of disk contamination . as",
    "disk stars are on average closer than the bulge , their contribution to the luminosity function at the apparent magnitude of the rc will be from stars dimmer than the rc , which are more numerous .",
    "in this work , we have demonstrated that deriving accurate cartography of the x - shape and its possible metallicity - dependence necessitates a rigorous treatment of not only the spatial morphology , but of stellar physics as well .",
    "we explored in detail the predicted metallicity - dependence of the colours of the rc and rgb , of the ratio of rc to rg stars , and of the rgbb and their effects on studies of the split rc .",
    "this requirement to rigorously treat stellar evolution has previously been acknowledged by at least some of the literature .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite , in their independent discovery papers of the split rc , noted that the rgbb would confuse measurements of the properties of the two rcs . @xcite and @xcite both included the rgbb as part of their parameterization in modelling the spatial distribution function of rc stars .",
    "used basti @xcite isochrones to estimate an 11% cross - contamination rate between their bright and faint rc spectroscopic samples .",
    "in contrast , @xcite ignored the rgbb in their parameterization .",
    "we expect that as further analysis is completed , the values of the brightness difference between the two peaks and the fraction of stars in the fainter rc suggested by @xcite will be shown to be overestimated .",
    "we note that even with the precise predictions listed in table [ table : predictedluminosityparameters ] it will not be straightforward to convolve n - body models with stellar models to simulate apparent magnitude distribution functions .",
    "the first issue is that the luminosity of the rgbb has been shown to be likely overestimated by conventional stellar models by @xmath20.20 mag with a possible metallicity - trend in the offset .",
    "the second issue is that even if stellar models were perfect , it would still not be clear _ which _ stellar models to actually use , as the age - helium - metallicity relation of the bulge is uncertain at high metallicities .    finally , we comment on two sources of uncertainty not explored in this work .",
    "the first is that of contamination from foreground or background disk stars not in bar orbits but with apparent magnitude distributions overlapping those of stars in the bar .",
    "there will be disk contamination at the luminosity of the rc within any bulge photometric sample , and further , that ratio could be metallicity - dependent . as the disk stars have a different spatial distribution than stars captured around bar / bulge orbits , this will lead to distortions in the distance distribution function .",
    "the second source of uncertainty lies with the shape of the distance distribution function .",
    "each of @xcite , , @xcite and @xcite investigated the split rc by assuming a gaussian distribution for the apparent magnitudes of the two rcs .",
    "however , the top panel of figure [ fig : nbodylf ] predicts non - gaussian distance distribution functions along the line of sight , with a negative skew for the brighter rc and a positive skew for the fainter rc . for a skewed distribution function , the mode will not correspond to the mean , which could lead to distortions when comparing data to models , or when simply fitting for the rcs in the luminosity function .",
    "the mapping of the spatial morphology of galactic bulge stars and the extent to which the mapping depends on metallicity is a fundamental research enterprise in galactic archeology .",
    "however , this enterprise is a challenging one , with numerous systematics potentially plaguing the way forward . as more data ( photometry , spectroscopy , proper motions , etc ) comes in from surveys such as gaia - eso @xcite ,",
    "gibs @xcite , vvv and ogle - iv @xcite , we expect not only better diagnostic power , but also the need for more sophisticated accounting of stellar physics and galactic dynamics to properly interpret these data .",
