    "x persei / hd 24534 is a bright and variable be star , the optical / near - ir counterpart of the low - luminosity x - ray source 4u 0352 + 30 , which belongs to the class of be / x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified a disk loss state in x per during 1989 - 1990 while @xcite presented evidence for a similar ` extended low - luminosity state ' during 1974 - 1977 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data during the disk - less phase and estimated the spectral type to be o9.5 iiie and set an age of 6 myr for the x per system .",
    "the distance and rotation velocity ( @xmath3 ) are estimated to be 1300 pc and 200 km s@xmath4 respectively @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of the system was inferred from @xmath5 data to be 250 days while the eccentricity is 0.11 and orbital inclination angle is in between 26 and 33 degrees @xcite .",
    "@xcite did infrared photometric and spectroscopic studies of x per during 2010 december 4 to 2011 february 8 and found the object to be in a photometrically bright state in the near - ir compared to earlier recorded values .",
    "large optical depth effects were also observed in the hi recombination lines as implied from the deviation of paschen and brackett line strengths from recombination case b values .",
    "the object was found to show infrared excess which was modeled using a free - free excess from the disk to allow estimating a mean value of electron density , @xmath6 = 4 @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath9 , which is consistent with the values estimated in be stars .    because of the steady brightening trend in the @xmath0 bands , we continued monitoring x per from mt .",
    "abu infrared observatory which has led to two interesting results that are reported here .",
    "first , the object is found to have evolved to an unprecedented state of high near - ir brightness .",
    "this brightening is worth reporting as it should interest other observers and encourage further monitoring of the object .",
    "the second significant result is the observation of an anti - correlation between the line equivalent widths ( and also line fluxes ) with the continuum brightness as measured by the ir magnitudes .",
    "a search in the literature indicates that this type of inverse correlation is not too frequently seen in be stars .",
    "@xcite have made a detailed study of the dependence of h@xmath10 equivalent widths on the v band magnitudes during long term variations of classical be stars .",
    "they point out the examples of a few stars which have exhibited such an inverse correlation namely : 4 her ( b9e ; @xcite ) , 88 her ( b7pshe ; @xcite ) , v1294 aql ( b0ve ; @xcite ) and eta cen ( b1.5ivne ; @xcite ) .",
    "another notable example is that of the be star in which @xcite identified an anti - correlation between the h@xmath10 line flux and @xmath11-band brightness of the star after its 2001 periastron passage , during which it transitioned from a normal b - type star to a be star .",
    "this increase in h@xmath10 line flux with a fading in @xmath11-band flux was explained in terms of episodes of enhanced mass loss from the star .",
    "however , this explanation was not found entirely satisfactory by @xcite for several reasons .",
    "they discussed and studied several alternative causes for the observed anti - correlation behavior but concluded by admitting that a convincing explanation could not be offered by their model ( see section 4 in carciofi et al .",
    "they suggested that rather than a static model of the be star circumstellar disk , a complex dynamic model with a significant change in mass - loss rate and circumstellar geometry is needed to explain this phenomenon .",
    "@xcite identified an anti - correlation between the h@xmath10 equivalent width and @xmath11-band magnitude of the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star p cygni .",
    "@xcite recently verified this anti - correlation as part of an international observing campaign where they did contemporaneous @xmath11-band photometry and h@xmath10 equivalent width measurements . in view of the limited examples of this phenomenon seen in",
    "be stars , it becomes necessary to report and if possible understand the observed behavior of x per .",
    "@xcite observed x per during the bright phase in 1994 - 1995 and found a rise in infrared flux values with a peak in 1994 september 19 followed by the fading of light curve .",
    "the emission strength of h@xmath10 also increased during this time but reached the peak only after the fading in infrared light curve started .",
    "they developed an expanding ring model to explain this phenomenon in which they proposed the infrared excess and h@xmath10 line emission to arise from different regions of the envelope and their maximum values are reached at different evolution stage of the envelope .",
    "they also found that most of the infrared continuum emission came from within a region of 2 stellar radii while the maximum h@xmath10 emission arose from 6 stellar radii .",
    "the present work presents @xmath0 photometry that show the progress of x per to its present high level of brightness .",
    "multi - epoch @xmath0 spectra are also presented from which we analyze the temporal evolution and dependence of the line equivalent widths and line fluxes on the near - ir magnitudes .",
    "the infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of x per were carried out from the 1.2-m mt .",
    "abu telescope , operated by the physical research laboratory .",
    "photometry in the @xmath0 bands was done in photometric sky conditions using the imaging mode of the near - infrared imager / spectrometer which employs a 256 @xmath7 256 hgcdte nicmos3 array .",
    "several frames , in five dithered positions offset typically by 20 arcsec , were obtained for both the program object and a selected standard star (; spectral type a5v ) in each of the @xmath2 filters .",
    "the procedure for the near - ir photometric observations and the subsequent reduction and analysis of data followed a standard procedure described for example in @xcite .",
    "the log of the photometric observations and the @xmath0 magnitudes with the estimated errors are shown in table 1 .",
    "the near - ir spectra were obtained at a resolution of @xmath121000 in each of the @xmath2 bands using the nicmos3 array .",
    "the spectra were extracted using iraf and the wavelength calibration was done using a combination of oh sky lines and telluric lines that register with the stellar spectra .",
    "we have also observed the standard star at a similar airmass to the object .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf tasks and the details of the reduction procedure is given in the earlier study of x per by @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0 values presented in this paper are 0.2  0.3 mag brighter than these values and hence show that x per is at an all - time bright state in the near - ir .    in order to see whether a contemporaneous brightening event occurs in the optical also , we have looked for the @xmath11-band ccd data of x per in the aavso database .",
    "we could locate only 7 sets of photoelectric / ccd observations during the period of our ir observations ; though several visual estimates were available these were not considered due to the lack of accuracy .",
    "the light curve is plotted and is shown in the bottom panel of figure 1 .",
    "the @xmath11-band light curve also brightened up and the magnitude changed from 6.338 , when observed on 2010 december 10 , to @xmath11 = 6.114 on 2012 march 12 .",

    "no disk loss event was reported after 1989 .",
    "if the present brightening is due to the deposition of material in the disk , then it could lead to the expansion of the disk which may result in a future x - ray outburst event .",
    "however , at present the possibility of such an outburst in x per appears to be low @xcite .      in the present study we obtained @xmath0 spectra for 27 nights between 2011 october 14 to 2012 april 5 ( from here on referred to as epoch 2 ) .",
    "the log of the observations for these data is shown in table 2 . to prevent over - crowding in the display of these spectra",
    ", we present in figures 3 , 4 and 5 the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 spectra respectively for 10 selected dates which are reasonably equi - spaced over the observation span of epoch 2 and give a good idea of the spectral evolution .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra of x per are dominated by the recombination emission lines of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the prominent recombination lines present in the spectra are pa@xmath21 1.2818 @xmath1 m , pa@xmath22 1.0938 @xmath1 m lines in paschen series , br@xmath22 2.1656 @xmath1 m and brackett 10  18 lines in brackett series . of the helium lines",
    "hei 1.0830 @xmath1 m , 1.7002 @xmath1 m and 2.058 @xmath1 m are prominent which are present in @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 band spectra respectively .",
    "the oi 1.1287 @xmath1 m line is also seen whose strength is known to be influenced by the lyman @xmath21 fluorescence process ( e.g. , mathew et al . 2012a ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the prominent lines are given in table 2  the typical error in the measurement of the equivalent width values is 10 % .",
    "the spectra of x per obtained earlier for 7 nights during 2010 december 05  2011 february 8 ( epoch 1 ) were analyzed and discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have combined equivalent widths of this epoch 1 data - set with those of the present data to illustrate how the equivalent width values evolve with time .",
    "the equivalent width values obtained on 2011 january 28 are also added in table 2 as a sample representative of the previous set of observations .",
    "the evolution of equivalent width values of paschen @xmath21 , brackett @xmath22 , brackett 10  14 , hei 1.7002 @xmath1 m , 2.058 @xmath1 m emission lines are shown in figure 6 .",
    "it can be seen that the ew values are reduced in the present set of observations compared to the previous one . in the present set of observations",
    "also a decreasing trend is visible which is not as drastic in comparison with the previous data - set .",
    "the trend is visible homogeneously in all the above mentioned emission lines .",
    "what is clearly established in figure 6 is that the equivalent widths of the lines have systematically decreased with time whereas the broad band continuum fluxes ( shown in figure 1 ) have correspondingly increased during the same time .",
    "we also consider how the line luminosities or line fluxes evolve with time ( we use the terms line luminosity and line flux interchangeably ) . to determine the line",
    "fluxes we first flux calibrate the spectra with the corresponding broad band magnitudes which were measured simultaneously on the same night along with the spectra - these photometric magnitudes are listed in table 1 .",
    "line fluxes were then extracted from these flux calibrated spectra in a straight - forward way using iraf and these are shown in figure 7 .",
    "as seen in the figure , the emission line flux values of all the prominent lines decrease with time even as the continuum flux increases during the same time .",
    "this decrease in the line fluxes is a genuine decrease and shows that the anti - correlation of the equivalent widths with ir magnitudes does not arise from a `` flux dilution '' effect .",
    "flux dilution , also termed the `` veiling effect '' , occurs whenever there is a source of continuum emission in addition to the stellar photospheric emission and/or disk emission .",
    "the addition of a new continuum source will dampen the flux of an emission or absorption line , decreasing its equivalent width without actually affecting the line flux . from the mathematical definition of the equivalent width",
    "it can easily be seen that by increasing the continuum flux f@xmath23 by a factor of @xmath24 , while keeping the line flux f@xmath25 constant , decreases the equivalent width @xmath26 by 1/@xmath24 .",
    "examples of the effect of `` flux dilution '' on photospheric absorption lines may be seen for example in the papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for ease of comparison and visualization , of the evolution of the ew of the lines between epochs 1 and 2 , we have plotted in figure 8 two representative spectra of these respective epochs .",
    "these are for 2010 december 10 and 2012 february 28 ; the spectra are shown flux calibrated using the corresponding broad band @xmath0 magnitudes dereddened using @xmath27 = 0.39 ( these are shown as circles in figure 8) .",
    "the arrowed lines between the spectra show the slight increase in the continuum @xmath0 fluxes between 2010 to 2012 , whereas the spectra clearly show the anti - correlation in the line strengths which are seen to decrease from 2010 to 2012 .    to summarize , the continuum @xmath0 flux values are found to increase ( equivalently the j , h , k magnitudes are found to decrease ) while the equivalent width / line flux values are reduced with time in x per during the period of observations . hence it can be seen that an inverse correlation exists between the line equivalent widths ( or line fluxes ) and the continuum emission .",
    "we examine possible physical mechanisms , some of which are suggested in the literature ( for e.g. @xcite ) , that could be responsible for producing such a trend .",
    "we have considered three possible mechanisms to explain the observed anti - correlated behavior of the line and continuum strengths , viz . ,",
    "( i ) the recently proposed model by @xcite to account for such an effect ( ii ) episodes of increased mass loss and ( iii ) the presence of a radiatively warped precessing disk .",
    "@xcite have calculated model h@xmath10 equivalent widths and ubv magnitudes for be star disk models that grow in size and/or density with time .",
    "they show that these simple models are consistent with the known be star classes of positive and inverse correlations between long - term variations in h@xmath10 and v magnitude as identified by @xcite .",
    "they show that the inverse correlation between h@xmath10 and v magnitudes is expected at high inclination angles due to the changing scale height of the growing disks . in their model , for be stars observed at an inclination angle @xmath28 less than @xmath28@xmath29",
    ", disk formation should result in a positive correlation , while be stars observed at @xmath28 greater than @xmath28@xmath29 should exhibit an inverse correlation .",
    "the value of @xmath28@xmath29 is likely to depend on several parameters and hence is difficult to assess accurately but a likely value is i@xmath29 @xmath12 75@xmath30 .",
    "the authors however explain why this value may be only suggestive and should not be over - interpreted . in the case of x per we",
    "likely have a low inclination system with @xmath28 = 26@xmath30  33@xmath30 .",
    "this is also the case with delta sco ( @xmath28 = 30.2@xmath30 ; meilland et al .",
    "so there may be some difficulty in reconciling the behavior of these two stars within the above model of @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility exists that the infrared fluxes may be more sensitive to the inverse correlation at lower inclinations since the vertical extent of the disk could be larger at ir wavelengths .",
    "we next examine whether the observed anti - correlation might be explained by episodes of increased mass loss .",
    "such mass loss would increase either the the electron density in the disk or the volume of emitting gas - in either case the continuum and line emission may be expected to increase .",
    "this is because the free - free ( f - f ) emission from the disk will increase and in turn enhance the continuum ; independently and simultaneously the strength of the lines arising from the recombination process will also increase .",
    "this follows from the dependence of the continuum flux in the f - f emission and the line flux in the recombination process : in both processes the fluxes are proportional to n@xmath31v , where n@xmath32 is the electron density and v is the volume of the emitting gas @xcite .",
    "the possibility for the strength of certain lines to decrease - in this particular scenario - is if the injection of matter increases the disk density to such levels that these particular lines become optically thick . in which case",
    "the strength of the lines may decrease - but a rigorous radiative transfer analysis must be done to establish this which takes into account the interplay between optical depth at line - center ( @xmath33 ) and the line strength . from an observational point of view it is worth pointing out that in several be stars including x per , many of the near - ir lines are indeed optically thick in the pa , br , pf and hu series @xcite - especially the higher lines of the series .    in the case of delta",
    "sco , @xcite noted a similar anti - correlation between the visual and balmer h@xmath10 fluxes in the earlier evolution of the delta sco disk and suggested that it might be explained by episodes of increased mass loss .",
    "their reasoning was however based on a slightly different approach than that offered above . from our point of view , one of the arguments against the above mechanism is that the brightening of the continuum , by injection of matter into the disk , should be seen preferentially at the longer ir wavelengths , if caused by f - f flux increase , rather than in the visual .",
    "this is expected because of the nature of the dependence of the f - f emission with wavelength . however , in the present case the light curves in figure 1 show a similar brightening of about 0.2 to 0.3 mag in each of the @xmath11 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "such a variation could arise from a geometric effect created by the formation or removal of an obscuration of the central star s light .",
    "a radiatively warped disk is another possibility which could cause such a variation as suggested by @xcite in the case of delta sco .",
    "@xcite has shown how the radiation field of the central star can warp the decretion disk of be stars .",
    "@xcite also finds that be star disks can be unstable to radiation warping .",
    "if the density in the innermost parts of the disk is higher than 10@xmath34 g @xmath9 then such parts of the disk are optically thick and radiation driven warping can occur .",
    "geometrically the warp causes the disk to be effectively bent away from the original planar configuration @xcite .",
    "the effect of such a warp would place material at higher latitudes and increase the area of the stellar disk that could be blocked by the disk material along the line of sight .",
    "this blockage , because of thompson scattering of the incident continuum radiation , would be expected to be more pronounced in low inclination systems like x per ( @xmath28 = 26@xmath30  33@xmath30 ) or delta sco ( @xmath28 = 30.2@xmath30 ; meilland et al .",
    ". the continuum flux would hence decrease .",
    "however , since the warping causes the disk surface to curve out and thereby offer a larger cross - sectional area to the ionizing flux of the central star , more material can be photo - ionized which could lead to an increase in the strengths of the lines .",
    "thus , by our reasoning , the current bright state is because the warped portion of the disk is presently not in the line of sight ( l.o.s ) .",
    "but if this warped disk precesses , then the warped segment should come into the l.o.s in the future and a decline in the continuum should be seen then .",
    "it needs to be seen whether this happens .    from an observational point of view , is there evidence for warped precessing disks around be stars ?",
    "@xcite cites two possible examples .",
    "first is the study of @xcite who observed the be / x - ray binary and found a beat frequency of the orbital period of the neutron star and the precession period that could be due to a warped decretion disk around the be star .",
    "second , @xcite observed the be / x - ray transient in the optical , infrared and x - ray regimes and found that the disk becomes unstable to , what they assumed to be radiative warping , and then tilts and starts precessing .    to summarize",
    ", we have discussed the role of different mechanisms in explaining the observed dependence of the near - ir line strengths on the near - ir magnitudes in x per . the observed anti - correlation is not easily explained .",
    "we favor the presence of a radiation driven warped circumstellar disk to explain the observed behavior but it is possible that the underlying mechanism originates from a different cause .",
    "the research work at physical research laboratory is funded by the department of space , government of india .",
