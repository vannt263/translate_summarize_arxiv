    "the spin distribution of nuclear levels is important for hauser - feshbach - type calculations of astrophysical reaction rates @xcite .",
    "generally , the spin distribution of nuclear levels is assumed to be given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the level density for a given spin @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the spin - cutoff parameter @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the total level density ( summed over all spins ) is given by @xmath5 , while the total state density given by @xmath6 contains an additional factor @xmath7 for each level in order to take into account the @xmath8 degeneracy . in deriving the spin distribution",
    ", one typically assumes that the individual nucleon spins are pointing in random directions , hence the spin distribution becomes gaussian and can be described by only one parameter , the spin cutoff parameter .",
    "this parameter can be related to the moment of inertia @xmath9 by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the thermodynamical temperature @xcite .",
    "this result can be derived within an independent - particle model with individual nucleon spins but neglecting correlations @xcite .",
    "microscopic calculations of the spin distribution are difficult when correlations are present .",
    "experimental data on the spin - cutoff parameter are available only in a few cases @xcite .",
    "therefore , theoretical predictions of the spin - cutoff parameter are greatly desired .",

    "assuming that the spin distribution can be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , they found a significant suppression of the moment of inertia and an odd - even staggering of the spin - cutoff parameter due to pairing correlations at low excitation energies .",
    "the spa method @xcite is a useful treatment to evaluate approximately the partition function of finite systems with separable interactions such as the pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole ( p+qq ) interaction , and it provides the exact result at high temperatures .",
    "however , as temperatures decrease the spa becomes inaccurate because quantal fluctuations around the mean field can no longer be neglected . in leading order perturbation",
    "theory , small amplitude fluctuations give corrections to the partition function which can be treated by random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "however , such a perturbative treatment exhibits an infrared problem in the case where the nucleus is modeled in terms of independent nucleons moving in a deformed mean field : there are zero - frequency modes among normal vibrational modes .",
    "this can be understood because the spa method breaks the symmetry of rotational invariance for a deformed nucleus .",
    "it operates in a body - fixed reference frame which undergoes time - dependent transformations .",
    "the collective ( zero - frequency ) excitation , i.e. , the motion of the rotating frame , is treated on an equal footing with other excitations .",
    "this leads to a lagrangian which displays local symmetry yielding the mechanical equivalent of gauge invariance .",
    "the collective coordinate method developed by gervais and sakita @xcite treats the inherent symmetries of the problem consistently .",
    "it separates the so - called spurious motions from the intrinsic vibrations . in the laboratory frame , these zero - frequency excitations are not really spurious ; they represent a rotational motion which has to be treated separately .    in the present paper , we describe microscopically the nuclear rotation of a deformed nucleus including thermal and quantal fluctuations using the spa+rpa method , and derive the associated spin distribution of nuclear levels .",
    "first , using the collective coordinate method , the rotation is described in terms of the zero - frequency modes which emerge from the breaking of rotational invariance of the deformed mean field .",

    "the critical temperature @xmath200  mev estimated from this relation is close to the position @xmath201  mev of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b .     for @xmath0fe .",
    "the spa+rpa results ( solid curves ) are compared to the spin - cutoff model using the rigid - body moment of inertia ( dashed curves ) and the results from the fit to the moment of inertia according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:73 ] ) ( dotted curves ) . the fit and the spa+rpa calculations are almost indistinguishable . ]    we will now apply a similar analysis to the moment of inertia .",
    "figure [ fig4]a shows the moment of inertia as function of temperature @xmath11 . for comparison we also show the rigid - body value @xmath202  mev@xmath182 denoted by a dashed line .",
    "the calculated moment of inertia is smaller than the rigid - body value at low temperature .",
    "this strong suppression is well known as the effect due to the presence of pairing correlations in low - lying , superfluid - like bcs states . for high temperatures , however , the calculation approaches the rigid - body value because the nucleon cooper pairs break with increasing temperature .",
    "again , we can define the critical temperature of the pairing phase transition as the inflection point which is determined precisely by differentiation .",
    "differentiation of the @xmath130 curves reveals peaks around the critical temperature of @xmath196  mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "hence , the increase of @xmath130 is well correlated with both the @xmath165 shape of the heat capacity in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and the suppression of the effective pairing gaps in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    fe .",
    "results from the spa+rpa calculation ( full symbols ) are compared to a model using the rigid - body moment of inertia ( open symbols ) . ]    to investigate more closely the relation between the effective gaps and the moment of inertia , we examine the correlation of the average effective pairing gap @xmath203 with the moment of inertia , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . above @xmath204  @xmath205/mev , which corresponds to @xmath206  mev",
    ", this correlation is close to a straight line , while deviations from the line become apparent below this temperature .",
    "the observation of such a correlation across the critical temperature of @xmath207  mev means that the increase of the moment of inertia can be attributed to the suppression of the pairing correlation .",
    "this conclusion has already been obtained by alhassid _",
    "thus the increase of the moment of inertia can be considered as another signature of the pairing phase transition together with the @xmath165-shape of the heat capacity @xcite and the suppression of odd - even mass differences @xcite .     for @xmath0fe .",
    "relative components for spins @xmath208 , 2 , 4 , and 6 from spa+rpa calculations ( upper panel ) and from a spin - cutoff model using the rigid - body moment of inertia ( lower panel ) . ]    in the next step , we investigate the effect of the temperature - dependent moment of inertia on the spin distribution of nuclear levels for the case @xmath0fe . for this purpose ,",
    "we plot for the temperatures @xmath209 , 0.67 , 1.0 , and 2.0  mev the spin distribution @xmath210 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:64 ] ) in fig .",
    "moreover , we plot as function of temperature the first @xmath211 and second @xmath212 moments of this spin distribution where @xmath213 and @xmath214 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , and finally , we plot again as function of temperature relative components of the spin distribution for the spins @xmath215 , 2 , 4 , and 6  @xmath216 .",
    "comparing the spa+rpa results to the spin - cutoff model based on a rigid - body moment of inertia , we observe from figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , and [ fig8 ] that good agreement between the two is achieved at high temperatures @xmath217  mev .",
    "deviations are , however , significant for lower temperatures . in particular , the @xmath215 component is much larger than all other @xmath3-components in the spa+rpa calculation , whereas for the rigid - body spin - cutoff model , the largest component at low temperature is @xmath218 while the @xmath215 component is quite small . around @xmath219  mev in the spa+rpa calculation ,",
    "the @xmath215 component quickly decreases with increasing temperature whereas the @xmath218 component increases drastically up to @xmath220  mev where it becomes dominant , in agreement with the rigid - body spin - cutoff model . the @xmath221 and",
    "6 components also exhibit small magnitudes at low temperature and increase with increasing temperature .    to conclude the discussion",
    ", we would like to make two remarks .",
    "firstly , the spin distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] can be very well described by a phenomenological model for the moment of inertia @xmath222 with the parameters @xmath223  @xmath224mev , @xmath225  mev@xmath226 , and @xmath227  @xmath224mev .",
    "this model of the moment of inertia includes the effect of the quenching of pairing correlations .",
    "the three parameters of the model essentially determine the moment of inertia at zero temperature ( in the presence of pairing correlations ) , at very high temperature ( in the absence of pairing correlations ) , and the critical temperature itself .",
    "hence , the three parameters might be connected to collective @xmath228 transition rates within rotational bands at low and high spin , respectively , and to odd - even mass differences via @xmath199 .",
    "this would be interesting to investigate since a simple phenomenological model of the moment of inertia based on experimental observables would be valuable for many applications of the nuclear level density such as hauser - feshbach - type cross - section calculations .",
    "secondly , we note the presence of an @xmath165 shape in the second moment of the spin distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this is in analogy to the @xmath165 shape of the heat capacity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) which in itself is proportional to the second moment of the excitation - energy distribution for a given @xmath11 .",
    "we would therefore propose this @xmath165 shape of the second moment as another signature of the pairing phase transition , and it would be interesting to look for experimental evidence for it .",
    "we have presented a treatment of nuclear rotation by the spa+rpa method including thermal and quantal fluctuations . using the collective coordinate method and applying a marshalek - weneser treatment , the rpa partition function",
    "is separated into two parts : an intrinsic rpa and a rotational part .",
    "we then can derive the spin - dependent level density @xmath2 in the saddle - point approximation without the assumption of individual random spin vectors .",
    "the spin - cutoff parameter @xmath4 can be identified with the moment of inertia @xmath130 of the generalized belyaev formula . as an illustrative example",
    ", we have applied this method to @xmath0fe and investigated the thermal properties including the moment of inertia with consideration of thermal and quantal fluctuations .",
    "we obtained the same conclusion as alhassid _",
    "@xcite , namely that the increase of the moment of inertia with increasing temperature is attributed to the suppression of pairing correlations .",
    "the increase of the moment of inertia can therefore be considered as one of the signatures of the pairing phase transition in parallel with the @xmath165-shape of the heat capacity and the suppression of odd - even mass differences .",
    "the spin distribution of the level density shows that the @xmath215 component is dominant at low temperatures due to the presence of pairing correlation ; this component decreases with increasing temperature . at high temperatures ,",
    "the level density is governed by @xmath229 components . in this work",
    ", we assumed an axially symmetric nucleus with @xmath230 although our formulation can be easily extended to non - zero @xmath231 quantum numbers .",
    "however , the @xmath231 quantum number is thought to disappear due to @xmath231-mixing at some excitation energy above the yrast line . for this",
    "mixing , another degree of freedom , namely @xmath119 deformation is important .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate this issue in the future .",
