    "crystals with a general formula @xmath8o@xmath3 and the perovskite structure form a large family whose characteristic feature is a tendency to various ( ferroelectric , ferroelastic , magnetic , superconducting ) phase transitions .",
    "barium zirconate bazro@xmath3 , one of the members of this family , is a crystal with a high melting point ( @xmath72600@xmath9c ) , moderate dielectric constant ( @xmath740 ) , low dielectric losses , and low thermal expansion coefficient . it is widely used as a material for microwave ceramic capacitors and for inert crucibles used for growth of single crystals of high - temperature superconductors . in recent years , the interest to barium zirconate has revived again because it was found that bazro@xmath3 doped with acceptor impurities , in particular yttrium , is a high - temperature ionic conductor with high proton conductivity , which can be used in solid - oxide fuel cells .",
    "@xcite its solid solutions with batio@xmath3 are relaxors with a very high electric - field tuning of the dielectric constant ;  @xcite this property can be used in tunable filters , oscillators , phase shifters , etc .",
    "it should be noted that up to now , the properties of bazro@xmath3 have been studied mainly at room and higher temperatures",
    ". only a few experiments  @xcite ( in addition to the first - principles calculations  @xcite ) were undertaken to study the properties of bazro@xmath3 ( the ground - state structure , the behavior of the dielectric constant , etc . ) at low temperatures at which most perovskite oxides exhibit interesting properties .",
    "recent x - ray and neutron diffraction studies  @xcite did not found any phase transitions in bazro@xmath3 at @xmath10  k , so that barium zirconate retains the cubic @xmath11 structure down to very low temperatures ( 2  k ) .",
    "these structural data , however , disagree with the results of the first - principles phonon spectra calculations for bazro@xmath3 ( refs .  ) , in which the appearance of the unstable @xmath0 mode indicates an instability of the cubic structure with respect to the rotation of the oxygen octahedra . in ref .",
    ", the equilibrium low - symmetry @xmath12 structure was found , which results from the doubling the unit cell in all directions and the rotation of the zro@xmath13 octahedra according to glazer tilt system @xmath14 .",
    "taking into account of these rotations was shown to improve the agreement between the calculated values of the low - temperature dielectric constant with experiment .",
    "@xcite an indirect indication of the possible phase transformation in bazro@xmath3 crystals can be its very low thermal expansion coefficient at @xmath10  k.  @xcite in order to explain the disagreement between the theory and experiment , it was suggested that , for some reason , the long - range order in the octahedra rotations in these crystals can not be established even at low temperatures . in particular , it was supposed that it may be caused by zero - point lattice vibrations .",
    "@xcite    the aim of this work is to calculate the phonon spectrum and the ground - state structure for bazro@xmath3 from first principles and to find experimental evidence for the structural instability in this material .",
    "we started from the assumption that , even if the long - range order in barium zirconate is absent for some reason , the structural instability , if it exists , should be manifested in the change of the _",
    "local structure_. to search for these changes , the extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) studies are used .",
    "exafs is one of the modern powerful experimental techniques that enables to obtain detailed information on the local structure of crystals .  @xcite we expected to find the evidence for the structural instability in bazro@xmath3 from anomalous behavior of the debye ",
    "waller factors which characterize the magnitude of the local displacements and the amplitude of thermal vibrations .",
    "in this work , the calculations were performed from first principles using the density functional theory .",
    "the pseudopotentials for ba , zr , and o atoms used in the calculation were borrowed from refs .  .",
    "the cut - off energy of plane waves was 30  ha ( 816  ev ) .",
    "the integration over the brillouin zone was performed on the 8@xmath158@xmath158 monkhorst  pack mesh .",
    "the lattice parameters and the equilibrium atomic positions were determined from the condition of decreasing of the residual forces acting on the atoms below @xmath16  ha / bohr ( 0.25  mev /  ) while the accuracy of the total energy calculation was better than 10@xmath17  ha .",
    "to calculate of the phonon spectra , the formulas derived from the density functional perturbation theory and the interpolation technique  @xcite were used .",
    "the calculated lattice parameter for the cubic bazro@xmath3 was @xmath18   and agreed well with the experimental value obtained at 10  k ( 4.191   , ref .  ) .",
    "the slight difference of these values was due to a systematic underestimation of the lattice parameter typical for the local density approximation ( lda ) used in this work .",
    "the sample of barium zirconate was prepared by the solid phase reaction method .",
    "the initial components were baco@xmath3 and microcrystalline zro@xmath19 obtained by the decomposition of zrocl@xmath19@xmath208h@xmath19o at 300@xmath9c .",
    "the components were dried at 600@xmath9c , weighed in proper proportions , ground in acetone and calcined in air at 1100@xmath9c for 6  h. the resulting powder was ground again and annealed at 1500@xmath9c for 3  h. the single - phase character of the sample was confirmed by x - ray diffraction .",
    "four exafs spectra were recorded using the simultaneous registration of the transmission signal and x - ray fluorescence on the kmc-2 station of the bessy synchrotron radiation source ( the beam energy of 1.7  gev , the beam current up to 300  ma ) at the ba @xmath2-edge ( 5.247  kev ) at 300  k. the intensity of the incident radiation was measured by an ionization chamber , the intensity of radiation transmitted through the sample was measured with a silicon photodiode , and the intensity of the x - ray fluorescence excited in the sample was measured using the rntec silicon energy - dispersive detector .",
    "the ba @xmath2-edge was chosen for measurements because the expected structural instability , which is accompanied by the rotation of the oxygen octahedra , should manifest most strongly in the change of the ba  o interatomic distances , and not in the zr  o interatomic distances .",
    "this is because the zr  o distances change very little when the octahedra are rotated . in principle , the rotation of the octahedra could be also observed at the zr @xmath21-edge as the changes in the multiple - scattering contributions to the exafs spectra as proposed in ref .  .",
    "the exafs spectra processing was carried out in the traditional way .",
    "@xcite the spectra were independently proceeded , and the results were then averaged . since , according to our theoretical predictions , the temperature of the expected phase transition is below 300  k , the structure of bazro@xmath3 at room temperature is cubic , and so the structural instability should be manifested as enhanced debye ",

    "in the cubic @xmath11 phase ( _ a _ ) and the ground - state @xmath1 phase ( _ b _ ) . ]    the calculated phonon spectrum of bazro@xmath3 with the cubic perovskite structure ( space group @xmath11 ) is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that an unstable phonon with @xmath0 symmetry ( imaginary phonon energies are represented in the figure as negative values ) appears in this spectrum .",
    "the eigenvector of the unstable phonon indicates that the cubic structure is unstable with respect to the octahedra rotations .",
    "the results of our calculations are consistent with the results of previous calculations ,  @xcite but it should be noted that an additional instability at the @xmath22 point , which was observed in ref .  , was not found in our phonon spectrum .",

    "we write a landau - type expansion of the total energy of a crystal in a power series of the amplitudes of the distortions , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total energy of the parent cubic phase , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the angles of rotation around three fourfold axes of the cubic structure . from this expansion",
    "it can be shown that to find the ground - state structure , it is sufficient to calculate the energies of phases described by the order parameters ( @xmath34,0,0 ) , ( @xmath34,@xmath34,0 ) , and ( @xmath34,@xmath34,@xmath34 ) , which correspond to the minimums of @xmath35 for different combinations of signs of the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the specified order parameters correspond to the glazer tilt systems @xmath28 , @xmath26 , and @xmath23 , and lead to the @xmath1 , @xmath27 , and @xmath24 space groups , respectively .",
    "as follows from table  [ table1 ] , the @xmath1 phase has the lowest energy among these phases .",
    "this phase can be obtained from the cubic @xmath11 structure by the out - of - phase rotation of the oxygen octahedra around one of the fourfold axes .",
    "the energy of this phase is @xmath710  mev lower than the energy of the cubic phase ; this gives an estimated phase transition temperature of @xmath7120  k. the calculations of the phonon spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) and elastic properties for the @xmath1 phase prove that this phase is the ground - state structure .",
    "it should be noted that among the obtained phases there is no @xmath38 solution , which was considered as the ground - state structure in ref .  .",
    "this phase corresponds to the glazer tilt system @xmath14 , in which the rotation angles around three fourfold axes of the cubic structure are different .",
    "the testing of this solution showed that the @xmath38 structure very slowly relaxes to the @xmath1 solution found above ( the convergence to this result required over 400  iterations ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the use of the information on the symmetry of the total energy can significantly ( by more than 10  times ) reduce the computation time needed to find the ground - state structure and guarantees a correct result .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the theoretical calculations performed in this work enable to propose another explanation for the absence of the long - range order in bazro@xmath3 crystals in which the structural instability is expected .",
    "the closeness of the total energies of the @xmath24 , @xmath27 , and @xmath1 phases ( table  [ table1 ] ) , which can result from the condensation of the @xmath0 mode , but do not satisfy the group  subgroup relation , enables to suggest the appearance of the structural glass state when cooling the crystals .",
    "the internal strains and defects cause the appearance of different phases with close energies at different points of the sample , obviously resulting in the absence of the long - range order in the octahedra rotations .",
    "moreover , the oxygen vacancies , which can be generated in bazro@xmath3 quite easily , disturb the three - dimensional connectivity of the perovskite structure and can also contribute to the structural glass formation .",
    "the uniqueness of barium zirconate among other crystals with the perovskite structure results from the fact that the energy difference between the phases with different rotation patterns is only 0.84  mev ( table  [ table1 ] ) , which is much less than in other investigated crystals ( table  [ table4 ] ) . in our opinion",
    ", this small energy difference may explain the tendency of bazro@xmath3 to the formation of the structural glass .",
    "further experiments on bazro@xmath3 , such as studies of the temperature dependence of the diffraction line width , diffuse scattering , elastic properties , and other physical phenomena sensitive to the rotations of the octahedra , could provide additional information on the cause of the discrepancy between theory and experiment and to confirm or refute our explanation .",
    "we think that the low - temperature raman studies of barium zirconate can also be very useful ; our calculations show that five first - order raman lines located at 1636 , 104111 , 121128 , 350361 , and 547548  @xmath39 appear in three possible distorted phases ( @xmath24 , @xmath27 , and @xmath1 ) with the octahedra rotations .",

    "waller factor for the ba ",
    "o bonds in the exafs study of bazro@xmath3 suggest that barium zirconate actually exhibits the structural instability associated with the rotations of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "it is shown that zero - point lattice vibrations are not the factor that prevents the establishing of the long - range order in the octahedra rotations .",
    "very close energies of the phases with the different rotation patterns , which can result from the condensation of the @xmath0 phonon , suggest a possible transition to the structural glass state when cooling bazro@xmath3 samples .",
    "this explains the apparent contradiction between the theoretical predictions and the absence of the long - range order in the octahedra rotations observed in the experiment .",
