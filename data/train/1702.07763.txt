    "in classic time - to - event or survival data analysis , the object of interest is the occurrence time of the event , which is usually observed or right - censored .",
    "such right - censored data are well - studied and there are numerous methods , including ( semi-)parametric and nonparametric methods , available to handle such data . however , there are many other incomplete data scenarios in survival analysis , one being interval - censored data @xcite .",
    "interval - censored ( ic ) data arise commonly in a medical or longitudinal study in which the subjects are assessed periodically .",
    "for example , patients often visit clinics or hospitals at pre - scheduled times , and the events of interest may occur between visits .",
    "in this situation , the event time is only known to lie in some time interval .",
    "such data are called interval - censored data , while the occurrence times of the event are said to be interval - censored .",
    "note that right - censoring is a special case of interval - censoring .    because of the relative lack of well - established techniques for dealing with interval - censored data , an _ ad hoc _ approach is to assume that the event occurred at the middle ( or end ) of the time interval .",
    "however , such an approach is known to bias the results and lead to invalid inferences @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a nonparametric recursive - partitioning ( tree ) method appropriate for interval - censored data .",
    "the goal of this tree algorithm is to form groups of subjects within which subjects have similar survival distributions , thereby segmenting the population .",
    "the proposed method is an extension of the survival tree method proposed by @xcite ( which is designed to handle right - censored survival data ) , which was adapted to left - truncated and right - censored data in @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a framework embedding recursive partitioning into a well - defined theory of permutation tests developed by @xcite . in the popular tree algorithm cart @xcite , the selection of the splitting variable and the selection of the splitting point",
    "are accomplished in one step .",
    "such a procedure results in the method being more likely to split on attributes with more possible split points , and hence is biased in terms of selection of the splitting variable .",
    "the conditional inference tree algorithm of @xcite addresses this problem by separating these two steps .",
    "the algorithm works by first selecting the splitting variable , through the use of a conditional distribution that is constructed based on the assumption that the response and the covariates are independent .",
    "after the splitting variable is selected , the split point can be determined by any criterion , including those discussed by @xcite . the conditional inference tree algorithm that implements this method",
    "is implemented in the ` ctree ` function in the r package ` partykit ` @xcite .",
    "the conditional inference tree of @xcite measures the association of @xmath0 and a predictor @xmath1 by linear statistics of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a nonrandom transformation of covariate @xmath1 and @xmath4 is the influence function of the response @xmath0 . in the case of interval - censoring ,",
    "the response is @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 $ ] is the censoring interval within which the event time lies , and @xmath7 , the log - rank score .",
    "the function of the log - rank score in the algorithm is to assign the univariate scalar value @xmath8 to the bivariate response @xmath9 $ ] , so the algorithm can then execute in the same way as in the univariate numeric response case .",
    "each @xmath10 is standardized using the conditional expectation @xmath11 and covariance @xmath12 of @xmath10 given by @xcite , and the algorithm picks the covariate @xmath1 associated with the smallest @xmath13-value as the splitting variable .",
    "the log - rank score was first proposed by @xcite , who derived general ( asymptotically efficient ) rank invariant test procedures for detecting differences between two groups of independent observations .",
    "they also established that under @xmath14 , the null hypothesis that groups have the same distribution , using the statistics @xmath15 and @xmath16 to describe the @xmath17th group are equivalent , which means that using the log - rank score and log - rank test to compare survival curves of different groups are equivalent , under the condition of independent observations .",
    "more details about the log - rank score and its application in survival trees can be found in @xcite .",
    "the log - rank score for interval - censored data can be easily derived from the score equation given in @xcite , who extended the rank invariant tests of @xcite to left - truncated and interval - censored data .",
    "the log - rank score for interval - censored data is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the lower and upper boundaries of the censoring interval for the @xmath21th observation , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath22 is the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator ( npmle ) of the survival function . in practice",
    ", such an estimator can be constructed using the em - algorithm as proposed by @xcite .",
    "a special case is when the event time is observed , so interval @xmath6 $ ] reduces to a point since @xmath23 . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ equ1 ] ) can not be used directly to compute the log - rank score since @xmath24 .",
    "note that in such a case equation ( [ equ1 ] ) can be seen as the derivative of the function @xmath25 at @xmath26 , and therefore the corresponding log - rank score is @xmath27",
    "in this section , we use computer simulations to investigate the properties of the proposed tree method .",
    "we assume that the event time @xmath28 is generated from distribution @xmath29 . to generate the censoring interval under the non - informative censoring assumption , we generate the censoring mechanism of @xmath28 to mimic a longitudinal study .",
    "suppose there are @xmath30 examination times @xmath31 , which segment the time line into @xmath30 time intervals @xmath32 , ( t_1,t_2], ... ,(t_k,\\infty)$ ] .",
    "the censoring interval of @xmath28 is the one that contains @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath28 is generated independently from the censoring mechanism .",
    "the gap between two examination times @xmath33 can be fixed or be a random variable from some distribution @xmath34 . in either case , this mechanism ensures the possibility that some observations can potentially be right - censored , i.e. @xmath28 lies in @xmath35 .",
    "this mechanism is used in @xcite .",
    "we will study the properties of the proposed tree method in terms of its unbiasedness in selecting the splitting variable , its ability to recover the correct tree structure , and its prediction performance .",
    "the simulation setups are similar to those in @xcite .",
    "the survival tree of @xcite is unbiased in terms of selecting the splitting variable , which means that it selects each covariate with equal probability of splitting under the condition of independence between response and covariates .",
    "this suggests that the proposed interval - censored ( ic ) tree based on it is also unbiased .",
    "we explore the unbiasedness of the proposed ic tree in this section .",
    "the event time @xmath28 is randomly generated with the following possible distributions :    * exponential with rate @xmath36 * weibull distribution with shape @xmath37 , scale @xmath38 * lognormal distribution with mean @xmath37 , standard deviation @xmath39    the censoring interval is generated as described above for each generated @xmath28 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is either fixed or a random variable . note that the value of @xmath41 ( @xmath41 is fixed ) or the distribution of @xmath41 ( @xmath41 is a random variable ) controls the proportion of observations being right - censored .",
    "for each case , we select the parameters such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the observations are right - censored in the light and heavy censoring cases , respectively .",
    "the observed response for each observation is the censoring interval @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "there are five independent covariates @xmath45 , generated as follows :    * @xmath46 is uniform@xmath47 * @xmath48 is uniform@xmath47 * @xmath49 is ordinal on a grid of @xmath50 taking on the @xmath51 values @xmath52 * @xmath53 is binary@xmath50 * @xmath54 is binary@xmath50    since the response @xmath44 $ ] is generated independently from the covariates @xmath55 , there does not exist any true association between the survival outcome and covariates , and the tree algorithms should not split on any of the covariates ; unbiasedness would imply that if the tree is forced to split it would split with equal probabilities for all five .",
    "there are 10,000 simulation trials in each setting with sample size n = 200 .",
    "table 1 gives the raw counts of how often each variable was selected as the root split variable for each setting , along with the @xmath13-value from a pearson chi - squared test of equality of the chances of splitting on each of the five covariates .",
    "bias.table ] clearly shows that the proposed ic tree is indeed unbiased .",
    "although the pattern for the lognormal distribution is marginally significantly different from uniformity under heavy censoring , there does not appear to be any systematic preference for either continuous or binary covariates as the splitting variable .",
    "we next explore the proposed tree s ability to recover the correct underlying tree structure of the data .",
    "the simulation setup is as follows .",
    "there are six covariates @xmath56 , where @xmath57 randomly take values from the set @xmath58 , @xmath59 are binary@xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "only the first three covariates @xmath63 determine the distribution of the survival ( event ) time @xmath28 .",
    "the survival time @xmath28 has distribution according to the values of @xmath63 by the structure given in figure [ tree - struct ] .",
    "we generate @xmath28 from @xmath64 different distributions :    * exponential with four different values of @xmath65 from @xmath66 .",
    "* weibull distribution with shape parameter @xmath67 , which corresponds to decreasing hazard with time .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath68 takes the values @xmath69 . * weibull distribution with shape parameter @xmath70 , which corresponds to increasing hazard with time .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath68 takes the values @xmath71 . * log - normal distribution with location parameter @xmath72 and scale parameter @xmath73 with @xmath74 different pairs @xmath75 .",
    "* bathtub - shaped hazard model @xcite .",
    "the survival function is given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 set to take value @xmath80 .",
    "we use the censoring mechanism from the previous section to generate the censoring interval for each generated @xmath28 , with @xmath81 $ ] . to see the impact of right - censoring , we also consider different percentages of right - censoring among the training data . specifically , we simulate data without right - censoring ( @xmath82 observations right - censored ) , light censored data with about @xmath42 observations right - censored , and heavy censored data with about @xmath43 observations right - censored .",
    "we vary the number @xmath83 to achieve the desired right - censoring proportion .",
    "we also fit the survival trees of @xcite with imputed survival times at the beginning , middle and end of the censoring interval for interval - censored observations .",
    "the oracle survival tree of @xcite , which is fitted using the true event time @xmath28 ( without interval - censoring ) , is also included to show the ( unattainable ) optimal performance for the trees in each setting .",
    "we run 1,000 simulation trials for each setting to see how well the proposed ic tree recovers the correct tree structure .",
    "struct_recover ] gives the percentage of the time the correct tree structure is found for each setting .    from table",
    "[ struct_recover ] , we can see that the common _ ad hoc _ approach in the literature of imputing the event time at the beginning , middle or end of the censoring interval does not greatly affect the performance of a tree in terms of recovering the correct data structure .",
    "in fact , there is virtually no difference between the proposed ic tree and the survival trees fitted with imputed event times .",
    "this result holds regardless of the percentage of right - censoring .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this result .",
    "one explanation is that the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the survival curve of interval - censored data is only unique up to the so - called equivalence set @xmath84 , i=1, ... ,n$ ] . in a simple setting where each censoring interval @xmath85 , i=1, ... ,n$ ] is non - overlapping , the equivalence set @xmath84=(l_i , r_i]$ ] @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator demands that the curve be flat between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and can only jump within the equivalence sets .",
    "however , any curve that jumps an appropriate amount within the equivalence class will yield the same likelihood @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the imputation at the beginning , middle and end of the censoring interval @xmath90 $ ] means the corresponding curve jumps at @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath88 , respectively , and those curves are equivalent from the interval - censoring point of view , since they are all the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the resulting trees have similar forms since all of the imputation schemes result in curves that provide the same information for the tree to distinguish different survival distributions .",
    "another explanation is that although imputation at the beginning or end of the interval may bias the estimated survival curves on the terminal nodes of figure [ tree - struct ] , the bias amount may be similar for each terminal node .",
    "therefore , the biased curves may be as easily separable as the unbiased curves , which results in similar performance in terms of recovering the correct tree structure .",
    "however , such bias may result in worse prediction performance for the trees with imputation , as we will see in the next section .",
    "the proposed ic tree , along with the imputed survival trees , has good performance in recovering the correct tree structure when the sample size is reasonably large .",
    "in fact , in the case without right - censoring , the proposed ic tree and the imputed survival trees perform as well as the optimal tree .",
    "this demonstrates that interval - censoring has minimal impact on the tree s ability to recover the correct data structure .",
    "in contrast , right - censoring has significant effect on the tree s ability to recover the correct data structure , as the performance deteriorates when the right - censoring proportion increases .",
    "we use three simulation setups to test the prediction performance of the proposed ic tree . to see how it compares with a ( semi-)parametric model",
    ", we also include the cox proportional hazards model implemented in the ` r ` package ` icenreg ` @xcite in the simulations for comparison . to see the amount of information loss due to interval - censoring , we include the oracle versions of both tree and cox models , which are fitted using the actual event time @xmath28 .",
    "also included are the survival trees and cox ph models with imputation at the beginning , middle and end of the censoring interval for interval - censored observations .",
    "the three survival families are as follows :    1 .",
    "tree structured data as in section [ recoveringtree ] ; 2 .",
    "@xmath93 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath94 $ ] ,    where @xmath95 is a location parameter whose value is determined by covariates @xmath46 and @xmath48 . in the first setup",
    ", data are generated according to the tree structure described in section [ recoveringtree ] , so the trees should perform well . in this setup",
    "the five survival distributions used in table [ struct_recover ] are again used .",
    "the second and third setups are similar to those in @xcite . in these settings",
    "six independent covariates @xmath56 serve as predictor variables , with @xmath96 binary@xmath97 and @xmath98 uniform@xmath99 $ ] .",
    "the survival time @xmath100 depends on @xmath95 with three different distributions :    * exponential with parameter @xmath101 ; * weibull with increasing hazard , scale parameter @xmath102 and shape parameter @xmath103 ; * weibull with decreasing hazard , scale parameter @xmath104 and shape parameter @xmath105 .    in the second setup where @xmath93 , the linear proportional hazards assumption is satisfied , so the cox ph model should perform best in this setup .",
    "the third setup is similar to the second except that @xmath95 in this setup has a more complex nonlinear structure in terms of covariates , which makes the distributions of @xmath100 satisfy neither the cox ph model nor the tree structure .",
    "such a setup is to test how effective the ic trees and cox ph model are in a real world application where survival time might have a complex structure .    in all setups",
    ", we use the censoring mechanism described earlier to generate the censoring interval with @xmath41 randomly generated from the uniform distribution @xmath106 $ ] . corresponding results using a wider censoring interval @xmath107 $ ] gave similar results , except that all methods other than the oracle methods had higher predictive error because of the greater uncertainty caused by the wider censoring interval .",
    "three possible right - censoring rates , @xmath82 right - censoring , light censoring with about @xmath42 observations being right - censored and heavy censoring with about @xmath43 observations being right - censored , are considered in each setting .",
    "the survival time @xmath100 in the test set is also generated according to this process , except that no censoring is used , i.e. the survival time @xmath100 is never censored .",
    "the test set is set to have the same sample size as the training set .",
    "the size @xmath108 is used in the simulations presented here ; results with @xmath109 were similar .    to compare different methods ,",
    "we first need a performance measure .",
    "the most popular measure of error in the survival context is the brier score , along with its integrated version introduced by @xcite .",
    "the brier score at a fixed time @xmath110 is defined as    @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the predicted survival rate conditional on @xmath113 given by the model .",
    "the integrated brier score is given by @xmath114 and is usually preferred to the time - dependent brier score since it gives a summary of the prediction error over the entire study period . the key is to estimate the survival function @xmath115 , which is estimated by the npmle curves in each node for the trees and @xmath116 for the cox model .",
    "as long as @xmath115 is produced , we can use it to compute ibs in @xmath117 .",
    "figures [ fig : boxplot1][fig : boxplot3 ] give side - by - side ibs boxplots for all three setups with sample size @xmath118 .",
    "signed - rank tests show that any differences in the figures are statistically significant .",
    "figure [ fig : boxplot1 ] shows that in the presence of right - censoring the proposed ic tree has the best prediction performance ( except for the oracle methods ) in the first setup where the true structure is a tree .",
    "the proposed ic tree also outperforms the ic cox model in the third setup ( figure [ fig : boxplot3 ] ) , highlighting the ability of the tree to mimic a complex structure because of its flexible nature .",
    "the biggest advantage of the ic tree over the ic cox model occurs for the weibull survival distribution with increasing hazard and the lognormal distribution .",
    "as expected , the ic cox model usually outperforms the ic tree in the second setup ( figure [ fig : boxplot2 ] ) , but performance is actually comparable from a practical point of view ( and the trees can be better than the cox models for a weibull survival distribution with increasing hazard ) , illustrating that the tree can even represent a linear model reasonably .",
    "although the imputation - based methods seem to have comparable ability to recover the correct data structure as does the ic tree as we have seen in section [ recoveringtree ] , these methods are noticeably worse in terms of prediction in the settings with right - censoring .",
    "we can see that the proposed ic tree has smaller brier score than the trees with imputed data in all such settings .",
    "in contrast , the ic tree has no significant difference from the imputed survival trees when there is no right - censoring ( indeed , all of the methods have comparable performance ) .",
    "this pattern is driven by the poor performance of the kaplan - meier curves used at the terminal nodes of the imputation - based trees to estimate the upper tail of the survival distribution compared to the @xcite estimator used in the ic tree .",
    "this difference disappears when there is no right - censoring , resulting in nearly identical performance for all methods .",
    "an interesting observation is that right endpoint imputation results in better prediction performance than imputation at the beginning or middle points of the censoring interval , since this pushes uncensored observations further into the tail , even though endpoint imputation results in the worst performance in terms of recovering the correct tree structure ( as seen in section @xmath119 ) .",
    "end - point imputation also works best in terms of prediction for the cox model .",
    "the relative performance of the ic tree to the oracle tree is similar to the relative performance of the ic cox model to the oracle cox model .",
    "this suggests that information loss due to interval - censoring has a similar effect on the tree and cox models in terms of prediction performance .",
    "this also means that the relative performance of the ic tree and the ic cox model depends on the relative performance of their corresponding oracle versions , and the general conclusions regarding the performance of survival trees and the cox model carry over to the interval - censoring situation .    for both the ic tree and the cox model for interval - censored data ,",
    "performance is relatively unchanged when the right - censoring proportion increases .",
    "however , the imputation - based trees and cox models are quite sensitive to right - censoring as we can see their performances deteriorate dramatically when the right - censoring percentage increases .",
    "the signal tandmobiel@xmath120 study is a longitudinal prospective oral health study that was conducted in the flanders region of belgium from 1996 to 2001 . in this study , @xmath121 first year",
    "primary school schoolchildren were randomly sampled at the beginning of the study and were dental - examined annually by trained dentists .",
    "the data consist of at most six dental observations for each child including time of tooth emergence , caries experience and data on dietary and oral hygiene habits .",
    "the details of study design and research methodology can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data are provided as the tandmob2 data set in the r package bayessurv @xcite .",
    "the response variable examined is the time to emergence of the permanent upper left first premolar ( tooth @xmath122 in european dental notation ; this emergence time was also investigated in @xcite , @xcite ) . since permanent teeth do not emerge before age @xmath64 , the origin ( zero ) time",
    "is set at @xmath64 years of age throughout , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "potential predictors of emergence time of the child s tooth include gender , province , evidence of fluoride intake , type of educational system , starting age of brushing teeth , the total number of deciduous teeth that were decayed or missing due to caries or filled ( dmf.score ) , and the total number of deciduous teeth that were removed because of orthodontic reasons ( bad.score ) .    figure [ example24 ] gives the ic tree for the emergence time of the tooth .",
    "in addition to the interval - censoring , 37% of the observations for this variable are right - censored .",
    "the tree is laid out with emergence time distributions corresponding to later emergence on the left to earlier emergence on the right .",
    "we can see that more general decay is strongly associated with earlier emergence time , and girls tend to have earlier emergence times ; these patterns were also noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we can also note that more orthodontic removal of deciduous teeth is associated with earlier emergence time ; this could reflect a reverse causality in that children are more likely to have deciduous teeth removed to make room for permanent teeth in a not - fully - developed jaw when a dental professional sees that a permanent tooth is about to emerge earlier than is typical ( personal communication , keith b. annapolen , d.d.s .",
    ", february 20 , 2017 ) .",
    "one other interesting pattern is that for children with a large amount of decay ( @xmath123 ) their province of residence is predictive ; comparison of the estimated survival distributions indicates earlier emergence times in antwerp ( antwerpen , a ) , east flanders ( oost vlaanderen , o ) , and flemish brabant ( vlaams brabant , v ) , and later emergence times in limburg ( l ) and west flanders ( west vlaanderen , w ) .",
    "this location - based pattern has been noted before in these data , and apparently is due to the combination of misclassification of caries experience by certain examiners and the fact that examiners worked in geographic areas close their homes .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for further discussion .",
    "a major benefit of constructing a tree is that it highlights interaction effects in an obvious way .",
    "according to the tree when a child has less decay experience ( @xmath124 ) several covariates are predictive for emergence time ( gender , decay , and orthodontic tooth removal ) , but for heavy decay experience ( @xmath123 ) only province is predictive .",
    "the existence of this pattern ( which is of course not uncovered using standard analyses without prior knowledge to look for it ) is confirmed by cox regression fits to these two subgroups , as given in table [ subgroupfits ] .",
    "the observed test statistics are based on bootstrap estimates of the standard errors of the coefficients , and effect codings are used to code the two multiple - category predictors province and education .",
    "it is evident that the proportional hazards fits are consistent with the tree fit , as gender , dmf.score , and bad.score are the only variables that are statistically significant for the lower decay group , and several province effect codings are the only variables that are statistically significant in the higher decay group .",

    "<S> interval - censored data , in which the event time is only known to lie in some time interval , arise commonly in practice ; for example , in a medical study in which patients visit clinics or hospitals at pre - scheduled times , and the events of interest occur between visits . such data are appropriately analyzed using methods that account for this uncertainty in event time measurement . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a survival tree method for interval - censored data based on the conditional inference framework . </S>",
    "<S> using monte carlo simulations we find that the tree is effective in uncovering underlying tree structure , performs similarly to an interval - censored cox proportional hazards model fit when the true relationship is linear , and performs at least as well as ( and in the presence of right - censoring outperforms ) the cox model when the true relationship is not linear . </S>",
    "<S> further , the interval - censored tree outperforms survival trees based on imputing the event time as an endpoint or the midpoint of the censoring interval . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the application of the method on tooth emergence data .    </S>",
