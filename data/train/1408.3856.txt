    "the discovery of the pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite led to several interpretative problems on the physics of neutron stars and to the possibility that the standard theory of such objects could be revised including also the other anomalous objects that observations are revealing @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a realistic description of nuclear matter , one needs to account for the appearance of exotic particle at densities @xmath9 g/@xmath10 @xcite . despite of this requirement , the equation of state ( eos )",
    "considerably softens ( @xmath11 ) ( see @xcite ) and therefore the maximal neutron star mass results reduced .",
    "some approaches have been recently proposed to solve the problem @xcite , however there is no final agreement on the solution of the puzzle . in particular , the required maximal mass ( @xmath12 ) can be obtained for hyperon eos from more complex model of strong interaction than simple @xmath13-model with realistic hyperon - meson couplings . however , it is worth noticing that one can not derive a reliable @xmath14-@xmath2 relation for neutron stars from observations because there are no precise radius measurements for any stars @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the maximal limit of neutron star mass can increases considerably due to strong magnetic field inside the star .",
    "the observations of gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars may indicate the existence of magnetic fields of the order @xmath15 g on the stellar surface . in the center of the star , the magnetic field can exceed @xmath16 g.    realistic eos with hyperons and quarks in presence of strong magnetic field are considered in @xcite .",
    "the maximal mass of neutron star can exceed , in these cases , @xmath17 for @xmath18 g.    therefore it seems that the existence of neutron stars with masses exceeding considerably two solar mass ( without strong magnetic field ) is impossible in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) . despite of this theoretical constraint , it is interesting to note that there are several observational indications in favor of maximal masses that exceed this limit .",
    "in fact , masses of b1957 + 20 and 4u 1700 - 377 are estimated as @xmath19 @xcite while for psr j1748 - 2021b , the mass limit reaches @xmath20 @xcite .    in principle , observational data on neutron stars ( mainly the mass - radius @xmath21 relation ) can be used to investigate possible deviations from gr as probe for alternative gravity theories .",
    "alternatives to gr have been developed in order to solve several shortcomings related to the ultraviolet and infrared behaviors of the gravitational field as formulated in the einstein theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , extended theories of gravity could successfully address the recently established phenomenon of the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this fact is confirmed by observations of type ia supernovae @xcite , by microwave background radiation anisotropies @xcite , by cosmic shear through gravitational weak leasing surveys @xcite and by data coming from lyman alpha forest absorption lines @xcite .",
    "this acceleration should occur thanks to the so called _ dark energy _",
    ", a cosmic fluid with negative pressure according to the standard approach . in the framework of gr , the simplest explanation is given by the @xmath22cdm model where the einstein cosmological constant and the dark matter supply almost the 95@xmath23 of the cosmic budget .",
    "however , up to now , no final answer to the question of what are the fundamental constituents of such dark ingredients has been definitely found .",
    "alternative approaches to the resolution of dark side puzzle ( both dark matter and dark energy ) require to modify gravity ( for details see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "main advantages of such approaches are the possible unification of dark energy and early - time inflation @xcite and the explanation of cosmic structures without new exotic material ingredients @xcite . in principle",
    ", these theories can satisfactorily reproduce the data of astronomical observations and therefore one can not distinguish if the dark side issues can be addressed by geometry ( l.h.s . of field equations ) or by matter fluids ( r.h.s . of field equations ) .",
    "addressing exotic compact objects by modified gravity could give , in principle , new signatures in favor ( or in disfavor ) of possible extensions of gr .",
    "some models of @xmath0 gravity can be considered as unreliable because stable star configurations do not always exist @xcite .",
    "however the existence of stable star configurations can be achieved in certain cases due to the so - called _ chameleon mechanism _",
    "@xcite or may depend on the chosen eos . furthermore",
    ", strong gravitational regimes could be considered if one assume gr as the weak field limit of some more complicated effective gravitational theory @xcite . in this sense , higher - order corrections and extensions",
    "could be `` detected '' as the mechanism capable of producing anomalous neutron stars .",
    "in other words , the interior of a self - gravitating compact object could behave , in broad sense , like the early inflationary universe where strong gravitational fields were present .    as discussed in @xcite , the proposition of validity of gr as the only theory capable of describing neutron stars is rather an extrapolation because the strength of gravity within a star is orders and orders of magnitude larger than the gravitational strengths probed in the solar system weak field limit tests .",
    "neutron star models with quadratic corrections like @xmath24 gravity are considered in @xcite .",
    "if also magnetic fields are assumed , more realistic models can be considered @xcite ) . in the case of these quadratic corrections ,",
    "the possible increasing ( or decreasing ) of maximal star mass in comparison with gr is negligible for realistic values of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "realistic models addressing the observed models can be achieved by considering also cubic corrections in the ricci scalar @xmath2 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility of existence of neutron stars with extreme properties in the framework of extended theories of gravity .",
    "in particular we will take into account generalizations of the einstein gravity containing functions of the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath1 and we will compare them with @xmath0 gravity .",
    "in fact , involving the gauss - bonnet invariant into the gravitational action is a useful approach to cure shortcomings related to @xmath0 as , for example , the presence of ghosts .",
    "furthermore , some functions of the topological invariant @xmath26 are related to conserved quantities ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this fact seems to contribute to make stable self - gravitating systems , as we will see below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the field equations for @xmath1 and @xmath0 gravity and the corresponding modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations . in section iii is devoted to the discussion of relativistic mean field theory for dense matter . here",
    "we show how electromagnetic properties of particles give rise to the magnetic mean field of the neutron star and how such a field contributes to the eos .    in section iv , modified tov equations",
    "are numerically solved for realistic eos for matter in strong magnetic field . in particular , we investigate the cubic corrections for @xmath0 gravity and quadratic corrections for @xmath1 gravity .",
    "the results are compared to gr .",
    "conclusions and outlook are given in section v.",
    "let us consider now corrections to the gr where higher order curvature invariants are added to the standard hilbert - einstein action . as discussed above",
    ", such an approach is useful to address several issues related to dark components . in our case",
    ", we will show that such corrections results as further effective pressure in the tov equations .",
    "we will start with dealing with @xmath1 gravity and compare results with @xmath0 gravity .",

    "the situation is more clear from an intuitive point of view in comparison with @xmath0 gravity : masses and radii of stars differ from gr insignificantly because the term @xmath130 is small in comparison with @xmath2 term .",

    "therefore the existence of stable neutron stars with extremely magnetic fields in the center ( in comparison with gr ) is possible in this model .",

    "the cores of such stars can contain considerable fraction of @xmath134 and @xmath91 hyperons . the corresponding field in the center of the star can exceed @xmath135 g ( in gr , the maximal central field for these models is only @xmath136 g , see table iv ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar effect takes place also in the case of quadratic @xmath0 gravity ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we have considered neutron star models with strong magnetic fields in the framework of @xmath0 and @xmath1 gravity models .",
    "we have used a model with three meson fields for dense matter in strong magnetic field and coupled the corresponding eos to the modified tov equations .",
    "the reason to adopt such an approach is to investigate the possibility of the existence of neutron stars with extreme features as high central densities and large masses as recently pointed out by observations of some peculiar objects .",
    "our considerations show that considerable increasing of mass can be achieved adopting cubic @xmath0 gravity corrections .",
    "thus , the possibility of supermassive ( @xmath139 ) neutron stars with @xmath140 km in modified gravity seems , in principle , realistic .",
    "if such stars will be explicitly observed , this could be considered as a clear signature that some self - gravitating systems can violate general relativity constraints in favor of modified gravity .    on the other hand ,",
    "quadratic @xmath1 gravity corrections indicate that another interesting effect is possible : namely stable stars with central densities close to @xmath141 gev/@xmath6 ( and therefore with high strangeness fraction ) can exist .",
    "the field strength in the center can exceed @xmath142 g. this limit can not be achieved in general relativity by using standard observed matter .    as a general remark",
    ", we can say that the puzzles related to the existence of extreme neutron stars could be realistically addressed by supposing the emergence of corrections and extensions to the general relativity in the strong field regimes . in some sense",
    ", the mechanism could be similar to that supposed in the early - time inflation where higher - order curvature terms naturally emerge into dynamics . beside the explanation of anomalous compact star",
    ", this approach could be considered as an independent probe for modified gravity with respect to the analogue descriptions invoked for dark matter and dark energy .",
