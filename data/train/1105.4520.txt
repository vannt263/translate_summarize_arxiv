    "the theoretical description of adsorption is a long - standing complex problem in surface science that presently does not have a general solution @xcite .    in 1918",
    "langmuir derived the monolayer adsorption isotherm kinetically for gas monoatomic molecules adsorbed on the homogeneous surface of adsorbents without attractions among the adsorbed molecules @xcite .",
    "later , some theories have been proposed to describe multilayer adsorption in equilibrium @xcite . among them , the one of brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) @xcite and the one of frenkel - halsey - hill @xcite are the simplest which provide the basis to construct more elaborate approaches .",
    "those more elaborate analytic approaches take into account lateral interactions between the admolecules , differences between the energy of the first and upper layers , surface energetic heterogeneity and so forth .",
    "these leading models have played an important role in the characterization of solid surfaces by means of gas adsorption .",
    "a more accurate description of multilayer adsorption should account for the fact that , in practice , most adsorbates are polyatomic .",
    "even the simplest nonspherical molecules such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 may adsorb on more than one site depending on the surface structure @xcite .",
    "this effect , called multisite - occupancy adsorption , introduces a new complexity to the adsorption theory .",
    "the difficulty in the analysis of the multisite statistics is mainly associated with three factors which differentiate the @xmath2-mers statistics from the usual single - particle statistics .",
    "namely , @xmath3 no statistical equivalence exists between particles and vacancies ; @xmath4 the occupation of a given lattice site ensures that at least one of its nearest - neighbor sites is also occupied ; and @xmath5 an isolated vacancy can not serve to determine whether that site can ever become occupied .",
    "however , several attempts were done in the past in order to solve the @xmath2-mers problem . among them , onsager @xcite , zimm @xcite and isihara @xcite made important contributions to the understanding of the statistics of rigid rods in dilute solution .",
    "the fh theory , due independently to flory @xcite and to huggins @xcite , has overcome the restriction to dilute solution by means of a lattice calculation .",
    "the approach is a direct generalization of the theory of binary liquids in two dimensions or polymer molecules diluted in a monomeric solvent .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in the framework of the lattice - gas approach , the adsorption of @xmath2-mers on homogeneous surfaces is an isomorphous problem to the binary solutions of polymer - monomeric solvent .",
    "more recently , two new theories to describe adsorption with multisite occupancy have been introduced . in the first , ramirez - pastor et al .",
    "@xcite presented a model to study the adsorption of linear adsorbates on homogeneous surfaces .",
    "the model is based on exact forms of the thermodynamic functions of linear adsorbates in one dimension and its generalization to higher dimensions . in the second , which is called the fractional statistical theory of the adsorption of polyatomics ( fsta ) , the configuration of the molecule in the adsorbed state is incorporated as a model parameter @xcite .    the treatments in refs .",
    "@xcite are limited in their application because they are valid only for monolayer adsorption .",
    "there are few studies that take into account multisite occupancy at the multilayer regime @xcite .",
    "aranovich and donohue @xcite presented a multilayer adsorption isotherm that should be capable to include multisite occupancy .",
    "later , a closed exact solution for the multilayer adsorption isotherm of dimers was reported in ref .",
    "it demonstrates that the determinations of surface areas and adsorption energies from polyatomic adsorbate adsorption ( also called @xmath2-mers ) may be misestimated , if this polyatomic character is not properly incorporated in the thermodynamic functions from which experiments are interpreted .",
    "this treatment has recently been extended @xcite to include the two - dimensional nature of the substrate .",
    "there are another two important physical facts which have not been sufficiently studied : @xmath6 the effect of the lateral interactions between the ad - molecules and @xmath7 the effect of surface heterogeneity in presence of multisite and multilayer adsorption . in the first case",
    ", a recent paper @xcite extends the bet equation to include nearest - neighbor lateral interactions between the molecules adsorbed in the first layer .",
    "following the configuration - counting procedure of the bragg - williams approach and the quasi - chemical approximation , ref .",
    "@xcite gives us a simple statistical mechanical framework for studying multilayer adsorption of interacting polyatomics . in the second case , multilayer adsorption of polyatomics on heterogeneous surfaces is a topic of interest in surface science since it comprises most features present in experimental situations .",
    "surfaces generally present inhomogeneities due to irregular arrangement of surface and bulk atoms , the presence of various chemical species , etc . in this context , a recent job shows how the monolayer volume predicted by bet equation differs from its real value when considering both the adsorbate size and the surface topography @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "combined effects coming from lateral interactions , multisite occupancy and surface heterogeneity have been analyzed in the interesting paper by nikitas @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author concludes that : @xmath3 one can obtain an underestimation of the true monolayer capacity of the order of @xmath8 when the adsorbate occupies more than one lattice site , and this underestimation will become worse if the effect of the multisite occupancy is coupled with heterogeneity effects and @xmath4 the attractive interactions in the gas adsorption lead always to a weak overestimation of the monolayer volume .",
    "the previously discussed issues can be outlined in fig .",
    "1 , where dimensions of complexity are sketched . in each axis",
    "we see a particular characteristic of the adsorption process that can ( or can not ) be present in a particular model .",
    "usually , the more features a model has , the more is its generality ; and more complex the process it describes . in the multilayer regime , we can see models that include adsorption with lateral interactions , but they do not allow to multisite occupancy , or incorporate surface energetic heterogeneity , but they overlook lateral interactions in the adsorbed layer , etc . with fig .",
    "1 we try to show that , at present , some models venture in some of these dimensions of complexity but , the vast majority , lack the complete set of complexities .",
    "it is also clear that the farther away we are from the origin the more general ( and usually the more complex ) the model is .",
    "even more , the upper plane ( including multisite occupancy ) , is a set of models developed in the last decade that represent a leap forward in the lattice - gas theory .    in this work",
    "we will attempt to take one step further away from the origin , into a more general and encompassing scheme , presenting a model that considers the totality of these dimensions of complexity ( multilayer adsorption , lateral interactions , multisite occupancy , energetic heterogeneity and surface topography ) .",
    "for this purpose , a theoretical formalism is presented based upon the analytical expression of the adsorption isotherm with lateral interaction weighted by the characteristic length of the surface heterogeneous .",
    "in addition , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are performed in order to test the validity of the theoretical model .",
    "the new theoretical scheme allows us @xmath9 to obtain an accurate approximation for multilayer adsorption on two - dimensional substrates accounting multisite occupancy , lateral interactions , energetic heterogeneity and surface topography , and @xmath10 to provide a simple model from which experiments may be reinterpreted .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the theoretical formalism .",
    "section iii is devoted to describing the simulation scheme .",
    "the analysis of the results and discussion are given in section iv .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "in this section , we will present the model and make a revision of some existing theories describing the adsorption process in the framework of the lattice - gas approximation .",
    "we will focus on those contributions that give contextualized understanding of the work that we will present .",
    "the substrate is modeled by a regular lattice of @xmath11 sites with periodic boundary conditions , where the adsorption energy of the first layer @xmath12 depends on each site @xmath13 of the surface and the adsorbate is represented by @xmath2-mers ( linear particles that have @xmath2 identical units ) .",
    "a @xmath2-mer adsorbed occupies @xmath2 sites of the lattice and can arrange in many configurations .",
    "this property is called multisite - occupancy adsorption .    on the other hand , for higher layers ,",
    "the adsorption of a @xmath2-mer is exactly onto an already absorbed one , with an adsorption energy of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the monolayer structure reproduces in the remaining layers .",
    "the mechanism used to describe the adsorption in the multilayer regime mimics the phenomenon called pseudomorphism .",
    "this was observed , by using low - energy electron diffraction technique @xcite , in the case of adsorption of straight chain saturated hydrocarbon molecules on metallic surfaces .",
    "however , recent synchrotron x - ray scattering measurements show a different and more complex growth process in these systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for simplicity , here we study a variant of the model that maintains the same mechanism to describe the adsorption in the higher layers . because we analyze isotherms in the low coverage regime",
    ", we expect that this choice will not affect our results .",
    "finally , attractive and repulsive lateral interactions are considered in the first layer and horizontal interactions are ignored in higher layers . in this sense , although the contribution from the secondary adsorption can already be significant , the density of the molecules in the second and higher adlayers is expected to be much lower than that in the first adsorbed layer [ bet equation can be applied at coverage not greatly exceeding ( statistically ) monolayer coverage ] .",
    "therefore , it seems to be satisfactorily enough to take into account only the interactions between the primarily adsorbed molecules @xcite .    under these considerations",
    "we can write the hamiltonian as : @xmath15 where the first term of the right - hand side ( rhs ) represents the adsorption energy of the @xmath16 @xmath2-mers adsorbed in the first layer ( adjacent to de adsorbent ) and the second term is the energy of the @xmath17 @xmath2-mers adsorbed on top of the first layer ( second layer , third layer , and so on ) .",
    "the third and fourth terms correspond to the lateral interaction energy , where @xmath18 is the interaction energy between two nearest - neighbor ( nn ) units belonging to different @xmath2-mers adsorbed in the first layer ( we use @xmath19 for repulsive and @xmath20 for attractive interactions ) ; @xmath21 is the occupation variable which can take the values 0 if the site @xmath13 is empty or 1 if the site @xmath13 is occupied and @xmath22 represents pairs of nn sites . since the summation in the third term overestimates the total energy by including @xmath23 bonds belonging to the @xmath16 adsorbed @xmath2-mers , the fourth term subtracts this exceeding energy .",
    "our study will be restricted to the class of lattice - gas models in which the substrate is a regular array of individual adsorption sites where molecules can be deposited ( also in a discrete manner ) . in the following sections we will review some analytical deductions of those models . a more in depth treatment",
    "is carried out in the original publications .      one way to begin",
    "our analysis is to review the behavior of a system of identical particles , which will be adsorbed in a regular lattice of @xmath11 identical sites of adsorption @xcite .",
    "the supposition is that , like in the bet model , adsorption is done on the surface of the solid or onto an already adsorbed particle . in this case , in stead of adsorbing spherically symmetric ad - atoms , we will use entities ( that we will call @xmath2-mers ) that occupy @xmath2 consecutive lattice sites .",
    "therefore , we will only have two possible unit - adsorption processes : @xmath9 a @xmath2-mer occupies @xmath2 consecutive empty surface sites ; and @xmath10 a @xmath2-mer adsorbs on top of an already adsorbed @xmath2-mer .",
    "this adsorptive process will form columns of @xmath2-mers on the solid .",
    "we must notice that a unit - adsorption where a @xmath2-mer adsorbs on top of two already adsorbed @xmath2-mers is prohibited .    in the case of the unit - desorption processes , we will only be able to desorb a @xmath2-mer that is on the top of one @xmath2-mer column or a @xmath2-mer that is adsorbed on the solid surface , but has no other @xmath2-mers adsorbed on top of it .    under these conditions ,",
    "the grand partition function of the system is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the maximum number of columns that can be formed , @xmath26 it is the total number of distinguishable configurations of @xmath27 columns in @xmath11 sites and @xmath28 is the grand partition function of a unique column of @xmath2-mers that has at least one @xmath2-mer in the first layer .    on the other hand",
    ", we have that the grand partition function for the monolayer ( @xmath29 ) is : @xmath30 being @xmath27 , in this case , the number of @xmath2-mers adsorbed on the surface of the solid ( first layer ) , and @xmath31 the fugacity of the monolayer .",
    "@xmath32 is still the number of possible configurations with @xmath27 @xmath2-mers in @xmath11 sites .",
    "this quantity must be equal in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : newtheoricalmulticapa ] ) and ( [ eq : newtheoricalmonocapa ] ) .",
    "if now we compare eqs .",
    "( [ eq : newtheoricalmulticapa ] ) and ( [ eq : newtheoricalmonocapa ] ) we can observe that they have a similar form . this allows us to write : @xmath33 if , in addition , inspired by this similarity , we propose the following ansatz :    @xmath34    then @xmath35 where @xmath36 $ ] is the ratio between the partition function of a particle in the first layer and a particle in any other layer [ @xmath37 , being @xmath38 the boltzmann constant ] . and , then , we can write the monolayer coverage as :    @xmath39    now , the total coverage ( @xmath40 ) can be written in terms of the coverage of the monolayer ( @xmath41 ) :    @xmath42    the theoretical procedure in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4nt])-([eq:7nta ] ) provides the isotherm in the multilayer regime from the isotherm in the monolayer regime .",

    "our aim will be to generalize this expression to include the lateral interactions following the methodology used in ref .",

    ", we may mention the surfaces with energetic topography arising from a continuous distribution of adsorptive energy with spatial correlations , like those described by the dual site - bond model @xcite , or that arising from a solid where a small amount of randomly distributed impurity ( strongly adsorptive ) atoms are added @xcite . in both cases the energetic topography could be roughly represented by a random spatial distribution of irregular patches ( with a characteristic size ) of weak and strong sites .    in the particular case studied in this article , the surface",
    "is modeled in two different ways : @xmath9 as a chain of alternating patches of size @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "2a ) ; and @xmath10 as a collection of finite homotattic patches in a chessboard - like array , where each patch is assumed to be a domain of equal size , @xmath131 sites ( see fig .",
    "2b ) . in this model , the energy correlation length is simply given by the patch size .",
    "the computational simulations have been developed for one - dimensional chains of @xmath132 sites , and square @xmath133 lattices with @xmath134 , and periodic boundary conditions . with this lattice size",
    "we verified that finite - size effects are negligible .",
    "note , however , that the linear dimension @xmath135 has to be properly chosen in such a way that it is a multiple of @xmath79 .",
    "we start analyzing what happens when the topography is changed .",
    "3 shows the behavior of the multilayer adsorption isotherms for @xmath81 , @xmath136 and different topographies in 1d as indicated .",
    "the energy difference between different patches has been chosen to be high ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) in order to emphasize the effects of the surface heterogeneity .",
    "we have identified the different topographies as @xmath139 for patches of size @xmath79 , and @xmath140 for the case of a surface with two big patches ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "symbols represent simulation results and lines correspond to theoretical data [ eq .",
    "( [ isoh1daprox ] ) ] .",
    "it can be seen that all curves are contained between the two limit ones : the one corresponding to @xmath142 and the one corresponding to @xmath140 .    for @xmath143 ,",
    "the adsorption energy of a dimer in the first layer is @xmath144 for all configuration . in this condition",
    ", the system corresponds to a 1d lattice - gas of interacting dimers on a homogeneous surface and , consequently , eq .",
    "( [ isoh1daprox ] ) is exact .    in general , for @xmath145",
    ", this equation is approximate .",
    "for @xmath146 , the analytic isotherms agree very well with the simulation data .",
    "however , for @xmath45 ranging between 0 and 0.15 , some differences between theoretical and numerical data are observed .",
    "this happens because eq .",
    "( [ isoh1daprox ] ) has been built assuming that the three different pairs of sites are filled simultaneously and independently .",
    "however , for @xmath147 , the real process occurs in 3 stages : @xmath3 the pairs of sites ( @xmath83 ) are covered ; @xmath4 the pairs ( @xmath84 ) begin to be filled and @xmath5 the multilayer is formed .",
    "note that in the first stage all the pair of sites ( @xmath87 ) and ( @xmath88 ) are removed .",
    "for this regime , a better approximation can be obtained by a semisum of two isotherms with @xmath76 y @xmath77 .    when @xmath148 , the agreement between the analytic isotherms and the simulation data is very good . in this case , for @xmath147 the first stage does not eliminate all the pairs of sites ( @xmath87 ) and ( @xmath88 ) , because each dimer occupies only two sites in the strong patches .",
    "for this reason , the range of validity of eq .",
    "( [ isoh1daprox ] ) is wider than in the previous case .",
    "now , if @xmath149 or @xmath150 , the behaviors are similar to those observed for @xmath146 or @xmath148 , respectively . in general , for even @xmath79 ,",
    "the first stage eliminates almost completely the pairs of sites ( @xmath87 ) and ( @xmath88 ) , while this does not happen for odd @xmath79 . finally , when @xmath151 , the fraction of pair ( @xmath87 ) and ( @xmath88 ) goes to zero and eq .",
    "( [ isoh1daprox ] ) is exact .",
    "this limit corresponds to the called large patches topography ( @xmath140 surface in our model ) , where the surface is assumed to be a collection of homogeneous patches , large enough to neglect border effects between neighbor patches with different adsorption energies .",
    "we now analyze the effect of the lateral interactions on the behavior of the system . for this purpose , fig .",
    "4 shows the adsorption isotherms for @xmath81 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and two different values of the lateral interactions @xmath136 ( attractive case ) and @xmath152 ( repulsive case ) .",
    "in addition , for each value of @xmath153 , the limit topographies ( @xmath142 and @xmath140 ) have been considered ( as seen in fig .",
    "3 , all curves corresponding to all topographies are contained between them ) .",
    "for repulsive couplings , the interactions do not favor the adsorption on the first layer and the isotherms shift to higher values of pressure .",
    "on the other hand , attractive lateral interactions facilitate the formation of the monolayer .",
    "consequently , the isotherms shift to lower values of @xmath154 and their slope increases as the ratio @xmath155 increases .",
    "in both cases ( @xmath136 and @xmath152 ) , the agreement between theoretical and simulation data is excellent .    from the curves in fig . 4 ( and from data not shown here for the sake of clarity )",
    "it is observed that : there exists a wide range of @xmath153 s ( @xmath156 ) , where the theory provides an excellent fitting of the simulation data .",
    "in addition , most of the experiments in surface science are carried out in this range of interaction energy .",
    "then , the present theory not only represents a qualitative advance in the description of the multilayer adsorption of interacting @xmath2-mers on heterogeneous surfaces , but also gives a framework and compact equations to consistently interpret thermodynamic multilayer adsorption experiments of polyatomics species such as alkanes , alkenes , and other hydrocarbons on regular surfaces .",
    "the effect of energetic heterogeneity ( ratio between @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) is analyzed in fig .",
    "5 , where the degree of heterogeneity is varied by changing the value of @xmath77 between 1 and 100 with @xmath76 fixed ( @xmath137 ) . as in fig . 4 ,",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath136 .",
    "lines represent theoretical results and symbols correspond to simulation data ( @xmath138 : circles ; @xmath157 : triangles ; and @xmath158 : squares ) . for each set of values of the parameters ,",
    "the limit cases corresponding to @xmath142 ( open symbols ) and @xmath140 ( solid symbols ) topographies are studied . as it can be observed from the simple inspection of the figure , the effect of topography is important in a range of @xmath159 between @xmath160 and @xmath161 and is practically negligible for @xmath162 .    to complete",
    "the discussion started in fig .",
    "3 , we now evaluate the effect of the @xmath2-mer size on the adsorption isotherms .",
    "this study is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where the @xmath142 and @xmath140 multilayer adsorption isotherms are plotted for @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and two different values of @xmath2 ( @xmath81 and @xmath163 )",
    ". one important conclusion can be drawn from the figure .",
    "namely , the effects of topography and energetic heterogeneity tends to disappear as the size @xmath2 is increased .",
    "the study in figs .",
    "3 - 6 was repeated for surfaces in 2d .",
    "the behavior of the curves ( not shown here for brevity ) is very similar to the one observed in 1d .    summarizing",
    ", we have shown that just by using an expression of three terms , eq .",
    "( [ isoh1daprox ] ) , we can approach very well the multilayer isotherm in 1d and 2d for the adsorption of interacting polyatomics on heterogeneous surfaces . in the next",
    ", we will use this approximation and monte carlo simulations to study how lateral interactions , multisite occupancy and surface heterogeneity affect the determination of monolayer volume predicted by the bet equation .    in a typical experiment of adsorption ,",
    "the adsorbed volume of the gas , @xmath164 , is measured at different pressures and at a given fixed temperature , the total coverage is @xmath165 .",
    "analyzing an isotherm with the bet equation @xmath166 it is possible to estimate the monolayer volume if we rewrite the previous equation as : @xmath167 this equation is a linear function of @xmath45 .",
    "if we denote with @xmath168 and @xmath169 , the @xmath170-intercept and the slope of this straight line , respectively , we obtain @xmath171 and @xmath172 the asterisk has been added in order to indicate that the quantities given by eqs .",
    "( [ vas ] ) and ( [ cas ] ) correspond to the prediction of the bet theory .",
    "then , by means of a plot ( the so - called bet plot ) of the experimental data of @xmath173 vs @xmath45 , we can obtain an estimate of the monolayer volume and the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , in the experiments it is commonly found that there are deviations from linearity in the bet plot .    following the scheme described in previous paragraphs",
    ", we carry out numerical experiments to determine , in different adsorption situations , how much the value of the monolayer volume predicted by the bet equation differs from its real value , @xmath174 . with this purpose ,",
    "analytic and simulation isotherms were analyzed as experimental data . in this way",
    ", we have determined how adsorbate size , surface heterogeneity and lateral interactions , affect the standard determination of the monolayer volume .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot the calculated value of @xmath175 as a function of @xmath2 for fixed values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( namely @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) and different values of the attractive lateral interaction .",
    "the repulsive interactions , not shown in the figure , show a marked deviation from the predicted bet equation , therefore wiping out compensation effects due to the surface heterogeneity .",
    "we can see three sets of plots in fig . 7 .",
    "each set ( 1 ) is the result of the effect of different lateral interactions strengths : @xmath176 , circles ; @xmath177 , squares and @xmath178 , triangles ; and ( 2 ) depicts the limiting cases for the surface topography : open and solid symbols correspond to @xmath142 and @xmath140 surfaces , respectively .",
    "all other topographies must lay in between those two plots .",
    "if we analyze the behavior of the open symbols , we are analyzing , essentially , the homogenous case @xcite where an already known feature for the homogeneous scenario can be distinguished : the compensation effect of @xmath2 is lower as @xmath2 increases , as @xcite stated for the non - interacting case . on the other hand , for @xmath140 surfaces , the compensation effect increases with @xmath2 as seen in @xcite . in all cases , for stronger ( attractive ) interaction strength the plots move upwards showing greater compensation effects .",
    "as shown in previous work @xcite for non - interacting @xmath2-mers on homogeneous surfaces , the monolayer volume from the bet model diminishes with increasing values of the @xmath2-mer size .",
    "the data presented in fig . 7 demonstrate that attractive lateral interactions and surface heterogeneity play a key role in the compensation of @xmath2-mer size effects .",
    "this finding is very important because most of the experiments in surface science are carried out in these conditions .",
    "finally , the study in fig .",
    "7 is repeated for 2d surfaces ( see fig .",
    "in this case , both the compensation effect for attractive interactions and the underestimation of the monolayer volume for repulsive interactions ( not shown here ) are more important than in the 1d case .",
    "the explanation is simple : in 1d systems , particles will interact only at their ends , regardless of @xmath2 ; on the other hand , in 2d systems , each particle interacts at their ends , but also interacts along its @xmath2 monomers .",
    "this makes the interaction energy grow linearly with @xmath2 ( if all first neighbors are occupied ) , and indicates that lateral interactions will play a more important role in two - dimensional adsorption systems than in one - dimensional ones .",
    "in this work , we have studied the multilayer adsorption of interacting polyatomic molecules onto heterogeneous surface .",
    "the polyatomic character of the adsorbate was modeled by a lattice gas of @xmath2-mers . with respect to lateral interactions ,",
    "the ad - ad couplings in the monolayer were explicitly considered in the solutions .",
    "the range of validity of analytical isotherms was analyzed by comparing theoretical and mc simulation results .",
    "we also analyzed the 1d and 2d bet plots obtained using the theoretical and simulation isotherms .",
    "for non - interacting @xmath2-mers , we found that the use of bet equation leads to an underestimate of the true monolayer volume : this volume diminishes as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "the situation is different for the case of interacting molecules over heterogeneous surface .",
    "thus , attractive lateral interactions favor the formation of the monolayer and , consequently , compensate the effect of the multisite occupancy . in this case",
    ", the monolayer volume predicted by bet equation agrees very well with the corresponding true value . in the case of repulsive couplings ,",
    "the lateral interactions impede the formation of the monolayer and the bet predictions are bad ( even worse than those obtained in the non - interacting case ) .",
    "both the compensation effect for attractive interactions and the underestimation of the monolayer volume for repulsive interactions are more important for 2d systems .",
