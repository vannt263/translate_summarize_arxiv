    "satellite navigation systems have been tried on safety critical applications in various fields .",
    "one of the most successful applications is the satellite based augmentation system ( sbas ) .",
    "it was commissioned for aviation in usa in 2003  @xcite and is planned to cover large parts of the globe around 2020  @xcite .",
    "sbas provides integrity alerts to contain the probability of hazardously misleading information below a given integrity risk .",
    "for example , the category of approach procedures with vertical guidance i ( apv - i ) requires that the probability that a vertical navigation positioning error exceeds the alert limit of 50 m without integrity alerts should be less than @xmath0 per approach .",
    "sbas bases on over - bounding statistics that are designed to cover potential threats with sufficient margins .",
    "for example , orbit and clock errors of global positioning system ( gps ) are investigated over a considerable period and over - bounding distributions are provided  @xcite .",
    "multipath errors at antennas on airplanes are also modeled and simulated  @xcite and taken into consideration of standard multipath powers as functions of parameters such as an elevation angle of a satellite  @xcite .",
    "besides aviation , applications to other fields including railways are being tried  @xcite .",
    "near surface , however , serious and diversified errors caused by multipaths have been reported  @xcite . since multipath errors show strong dependences on each propagation environment , no distributions",
    "are confirmed to over - bound multipath errors , so far .",
    "when sufficient statistics are not available , additional sensors are expected to overcome threats .",
    "it was pointed out that a precise clock of a receiver works to detect an error in an estimate of clock bias that has correlation with an error in an estimate of vertical position  @xcite . in the same literature ,",
    "a horizontal position error was denoted as essentially uncorrelated with an estimate of a clock bias error .    in this paper ,",
    "two methods to upper - bound bias errors are shown . the worst bias error in a maximum likelihood estimate caused by an interference signal within a given small power",
    "is derived in a simple expression in section  [ sec : by power ] .",
    "it gives fast estimation of the worst bias error once the power of an interference signal becomes available as in  @xcite . in section  [ sec : by geometry ] a novel inequality condition with a clock bias error and magnification coefficients that upper - bounds a horizontal position error is presented .",
    "robustness of the inequality condition is numerically evaluated based on an ephemeris of gps satellites in section  [ sec : numerical evaluation ] and the conclusion follows .",
    "a general framework of the worst bias error in a maximum likelihood estimate caused by an interference signal within a given small power is presented in  @xcite . for a cord spread signal as used in gps , it is further possible to express and evaluate the worst mode explicitly as follows .",
    "suppose that a signal is periodically sampled at @xmath1 for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a sampling period , and modeled by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a known code @xmath6 with an unknown delay @xmath7 multiplied by an amplitude @xmath8 and a phase @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are respectively an interference signal and a noise independently obeying a gaussian distribution density @xmath12 the logarithmic likelihood function of parameters with respect to samples is derived as @xmath13 with @xmath14 let @xmath15 denote the maximum likelihood estimate of the delay for the unperturbed ( @xmath16 ) system , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the one for the perturbed system with a small @xmath19 .",
    "the condition @xmath20 gives an explicit representation @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the derivative of @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath25 , and c.c . denotes the complex conjugate of the previous term .",
    "straightforward calculation up to the first order gives @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the inner product of complex vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the same dimension , @xmath30 is the square root of a power of an interference signal @xmath19 , and @xmath31 denotes the second derivative of @xmath23 .",
    "the equality holds for the interference signal @xmath19 parallel to @xmath22 .",
    "this worst mode corresponds to the goldstone mode with respect to the time translational symmetry  @xcite and gives fast estimate of the worst error caused by an interference within a given small power regardless of details , once the power of interference becomes available .",
    "the observation equation of a pseudo range @xmath32 is derived by linearizing a pseudo range @xmath33 from the @xmath34-th navigation satellite ( @xmath35 ) reaching a base point @xmath36 at a base time @xmath37 for a neighborhood @xmath38 , where a geometry vector @xmath39 is the unit direction vector to the @xmath34-th satellite form the base point @xmath36 multiplied by @xmath40 , @xmath41 is an correction term on the pseudo range form the @xmath34-th satellite , @xmath29 is called a bias , and @xmath42 denotes the light velocity .",
    "suppose that a position of an antenna is limited in a curve @xmath43 that is continuous and an almost everywhere differentiable function of the distance @xmath44 from the base point ( fig .  1 ( a ) ) .",
    "let @xmath45 and @xmath46 be the tangential unit vector of the curve and the unit vector to the center of the osculating circle that is tangential to the curve at the point @xmath47 respectively , and @xmath48 be the unit vector that consists of a orthogonal frame with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which is called the frenet frame ( fig .  1 ( b ) ) .",
