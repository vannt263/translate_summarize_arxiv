    "over the the past fifteen years , since baxter s famous book first appeared in print @xcite , the full relevance of the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) in the theory of solvable two - dimensional lattice models has been realized .",
    "moreover , many fruitful and partly unexpected connections to other branches of mathematics and physics , including for example quantum groups , knot and link invariants , and integrable quantum field theories with purely elastic ( factorized ) scattering , have been discovered .    among the several algebraic techniques used to construct solutions to the ybe",
    ", a particularly interesting approach is based on braid - monoid algebras ( bma ) @xcite . by a procedure called _ baxterization _",
    "@xcite , one reduces the problem of finding representations of the yang - baxter algebra ( yba ) to the simpler task of constructing representations of a certain bma .",
    "examples of bma for which a baxterization is known are the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite , the birman - wenzl - murakami ( bwm ) algebra @xcite and their recently introduced @xcite ` dilute ' @xcite and ` two - colour ' generalizations @xcite .    in this short note",
    ", we present explicit expressions for ` vertex - type ' representations of the two - colour bwm ( tcbwm ) algebra , by which we understand representations acting on a tensor product space .",
    "this is complementary to the content of ref .",
    "@xcite where exclusively rsos ( restricted solid - on - solid ) type representations were considered , for which the representation space is spanned by the set of all paths on certain graphs . here",
    ", the representations are constructed by suitably combining representations of the ordinary bwm algebra underlying the solvable vertex models of bazhanov @xcite and jimbo @xcite . by the known baxterization of the tcbwm algebra @xcite ,",
    "this yields solutions of the ybe and hence solvable lattice models of vertex type .",
    "in contrast to the case of rsos type representations discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not expect that the corresponding solvable vertex models are new .",
    "instead , we expect a similar scenario as in the dilute case , where the @xmath0-matrices constructed from representations of the dilute bwm algebra are related by a suitable gauge transformation to other members of the lists of well - known @xmath0-matrices @xcite . for one series of @xmath0-matrices ,",
    "this has been explicitly demonstrated in ref .",
    "for lack of space , we can not repeat the complete definition of the tcbwm algebra here , thus we only give a rough sketch of the idea , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "an ordinary bma @xcite is generated by two types of generators , the braids ( with their inverses ) and the monoids or temperley - lieb ( tl ) operators .",
    "besides the usual braid relations and the defining relations of the tl algebra , a number of relations involving both types of generators are imposed .",
    "all relations have a natural interpretation in terms of continuous moves in a diagrammatic presentation of the generators acting on arrays of strings @xcite , hinting at the connection to the theory of knot and link invariants .",
    "the defining relations also involve two central elements customarily denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which in the graphical interpretation are associated to closed loops and so - called ` twists ' , respectively .",
    "the bwm algebra is a certain quotient of a bma , in which the braid generators satisfy a cubic reduction relation @xcite .",
    "the tcbwm algebra is a two - colour generalization of the bwm algebra , with two species ( colours ) of strings .",
    "the generators now carry colour indices @xmath3 and one has additional generators @xmath4 which act as projection operators on certain colours . here , @xmath5 label the two colours , and @xmath6 denotes the complementary ( or opposite ) colour .",
    "furthermore , the generators carry a label @xmath7 . in the graphical interpretation",
    ", this means that the corresponding generator only acts on the two of the @xmath8 strings , namely on those labeled by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the central elements mentioned above now also carry colour indices , thus we have factors of @xmath11 and @xmath12 associated to closed loops and to ` twists ' in a string of colour @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the defining relations of the tcbwm algebra can most easily be understood directly from the diagrammatic interpretation : they are given by considering all possible colourings of the diagrams corresponding to the defining relations of the ordinary bwm algebra .",
    "in addition , we demand that any products leading to diagrams with colour mismatches vanish in the algebra .",
    "this statement basically reduces to the requirement that the generators @xmath4 are indeed orthogonal projectors .",
    "before we move on to the representations , let us briefly present the relations defining the bwm quotient . for the coloured braids ,",
    "one has the cubic reduction relations @xmath14 and the temperley - lieb generators @xmath15 are given by quadratic expressions in the braids as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17 is related to @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xmath18 which is a consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ cubic ] ) and ( [ quad ] ) and the defining relations of the tl algebra .",
    "we now present explicit expressions for representations of the tcbwm algebra .",
    "we build these representations on a pair of representations of the ordinary bwm algebra , which are labeled by affine lie algebras @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xcite and underlie the corresponding series of @xmath0-matrices of refs .  @xcite . thus the tcbwm representations are labeled by pairs @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and the index @xmath13 refers to the colour . given @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "the representation still contains two parameters @xmath17 , which determine @xmath12 through @xmath26 and thereby @xmath11 by eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) .",
    "the two - colour bwm representations we are interested in act on the tensor product space , where @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 and is the representation space for the single - colour representations . in these representations , the generators ( [ gen ] )",
    "act non - trivially only in two factors ( labeled by @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) of the @xmath8-fold tensor product , wherefore it suffices to give the expressions for two factors which thus are @xmath29 matrices which we denote by the same symbols ( [ gen ] ) without the site index @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce two index sets @xmath30 to keep apart labels referring to different colours . for @xmath31 , we define @xmath32 such that the possible values of @xmath33 for both colours lie symmetrically around zero . furthermore , we introduce symbols @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are defined as follows : @xmath36 note that @xmath37 can only occur for representations labeled by @xmath38 because these have an odd @xmath39 .    with these notations ,",
