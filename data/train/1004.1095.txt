    "in recent years , various ideas have been proposed to realize intelligent highway systems to reduce traffic congestions and improve safety levels .",
    "it is envisioned that navigation , communication and automatic driver assistance systems are critical components @xcite . a great deal of monitoring and controlling capabilities",
    "have been implemented through roadside infrastructures , such as cameras , sensors , and control and communication stations .",
    "such systems can work together to monitor in real time the situations on highways and at the same time guide vehicles to move in a coordinated fashion , e.g. to keep appropriate distances from the vehicles in front of and behind each individual vehicle .",
    "in intelligent highway systems , the guiding commands are expected to be simple and formatted as short digital messages to scale with the number of vehicles and also to avoid conflict with the automatic driver assistance systems installed within the vehicles .",
    "similar guided formation control problems also arise when navigating mobile robots or docking autonomous vehicles @xcite .    motivated by this problem of guiding platoons of vehicles on highways",
    ", we study in this paper the problem of controlling a one - dimensional multi - agent formation using only _ coarsely _ quantized information .",
    "the formation to be considered are rigid under inter - agent distance constraints and thus its shape is uniquely determined locally .",
    "most of the existing work on controlling rigid formations of mobile agents , e.g. @xcite , assumes that there is no communication bandwidth constraints and thus real - valued control signals are utilized .",
    "the idea of quantized control through digital communication channels has been applied to consensus problems , e.g.  @xcite and references therein , and more recently to formation control problems @xcite .",
    "the uniform quantizer and logarithmic quantizer @xcite are among the most popular choices for designing such controllers with quantized information . moreover , the paper @xcite has discussed krasowskii solutions and hysteretic quantizers in connection with continuous - time average consensus algorithms under quantized measurements .",
    "the problem studied in this paper distinguishes itself from the existing work in that it explores the limit of the least bandwidth for controlling a one - dimensional rigid formation by using a quantizer in its simplest form with only two quantization levels . as a result , for each agent in the rigid formation , at most four bits of bandwidth is needed for the communication with the navigation controller .",
    "the corresponding continuous - time model describing the behavior of the overall multi - agent formation is , however , non - smooth and thus an appropriate notion of solution @xcite has to be defined first .",
    "we use both the lyapunov approach and trajectory - based approach to prove convergence since the former provides a succinct view about the dynamic behavior while the latter leads to insight into the set of initial positions for which the proposed controller may fail .",
    "we also discuss some situations when different assumptions about the quantization scheme are made and indicate those scenarios in which the formation control problem with quantized information can be challenging to solve .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first formulate the one - dimensional guided formation control problem with coarsely quantized information in section [ se : formulation ] . then in section",
    "[ se : analysis ] , we provide the convergence analysis results first using the lyapunov method and then the trajectory - based method . simulation results are presented in section [ se : simulation ] to validate the theoretical analysis .",
    "we make concluding remarks in section [ se : conclusion ] .",
    "the one - dimensional guided formation that we are interested in consists of @xmath0 mobile agents .",
    "we consider the case when the formation is rigid @xcite ; to be more specific , if we align the given one - dimensional space with the @xmath1-axis in the plane and label the agents along the positive direction of the @xmath1-axis by @xmath2 , then the geometric shape of the formation is specified by the given pairwise distance constraints @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are desired distances .",
    "although the guidance system can monitor the motion of the agents in real time , we require that it can only broadcast to the mobile agents quantized guidance information through digital channels .",
    "in fact , we explore the limit for the bit constraint by utilizing the quantizer that only has two quantization levels and consequently its output only takes up one bit of bandwidth .",
    "the quantizer that is under consideration takes the form of the following sign function : for any @xmath6 , @xmath7 each agent , modeled by a kinematic point , then moves according to the following rules utilizing the coarsely quantized information : [ quantized.n.agent.system ] x_1 & = & -k_1 ( x_1-x_2 ) ( |x_1-x_2|-d_1 ) + x_i & = & ( x_i-1-x_i ) ( |x_i-1-x_i|-d_i-1)- + & & k_i ( x_i - x_i+1 ) ( |x_i - x_i+1|-d_i ) , + & & i=2,  ,n-1 + x_n & = & ( x_n-1-x_n ) ( |x_n-1-x_n|-d_n-1 ) where @xmath8 is the position of agent @xmath9 in the one - dimensional space aligned with the @xmath1-axis , and @xmath10 are gains to be designed . note",
    "that since each agent is governed by at most two distance constraints , as is clear from ( [ quantized.n.agent.system ] ) , a bandwidth of four bits is sufficient for the communication between the guidance system and the agents @xmath11 and the required bandwidths for the guidance signals for agents @xmath12 and @xmath0 are both 2 bits .",
    "hence , in total only @xmath13 bits of bandwidth is used .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate under this extreme situation of using coarsely quantized information , the formation still exhibits satisfying convergence properties under the proposed maneuvering rules . towards this end , we introduce the variables of relative positions among the agents [ z ] z_ix_i - x_i+1,i=1,2,  ,n-1 .",
    "let us express the system in the @xmath14-coordinates to obtain [ quantized.n.agent.system.z ] z_1 & = & -(k_1 + 1 ) ( z_1 ) ( |z_1|-d_1 ) + & & + k_2 ( z_2 ) ( |z_2|-d_2 ) + z_i & = & ( z_i-1 ) ( |z_i-1|-d_i-1 ) + & & -(k_i+1 ) ( z_i ) ( |z_i|-d_i ) + & & + k_i+1 ( z_i+1 ) ( |z_i+1|-d_i+1 ) , + & & i=2, ",

    "since the vector field @xmath15 on the right - hand side is discontinuous , we consider krasowskii solutions , namely solutions to the differential inclusion @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xmath18 denotes the involutive closure of a set , and @xmath19 is the ball centered at @xmath14 and of the radius @xmath20 .",
    "the need to consider these solutions becomes evident in the analysis in the next section . since the right - hand side of ( [ quantized.n.agent.system ] ) is also discontinuous ,",
    "its solutions are to be intended in the krasowskii sense as well .",
    "then we can infer conclusions on the behavior of ( [ quantized.n.agent.system ] ) provided that each solution @xmath1 of ( [ quantized.n.agent.system ] ) is such that @xmath14 defined in ( [ z ] ) is a krasowskii solution of ( [ quantized.n.agent.system.z ] ) .",
    "this is actually the case by @xcite , theorem 1 , point 5 ) , and it is the condition under which we consider ( [ quantized.n.agent.system.z ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath14-system ( [ quantized.n.agent.system.z ] ) is easier to work with for the convergence analysis that we present in detail in the next section .",
    "in this section , after identifying the equilibria of the system , we present two different approaches for convergence analysis . the first is based on a lyapunov - like function and the second examines the vector field in the neighborhood of the system s trajectories .",
    "we start the analysis of system ( [ quantized.n.agent.system.z ] ) by looking at the discontinuity points of the system .",
    "a discontinuity point is a point at which the vector field on the right - hand side of the equations above is discontinuous .",
    "hence , the set @xmath21 of all the discontinuity points is : @xmath22 it is of interest to characterize the set of equilibria :    [ lemma.equilibria ] let @xmath23 , @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
