    "according to mirror symmetry , it is believed that various counting functions on calabi - yau manifolds are related to period integrals on their mirror families .",
    "one case where the relation is well understood is that of 1-dimensional compact calabi - yau manifolds , that is , elliptic curves . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the counting function of simply ramified finite coverings of an elliptic curve is equal to the partition functions in fermionic and bosonic field theories on the mirror family .",
    "we can also consider non - compact but algebraic analogues of calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "the simplest one is @xmath0 : we regard it as an ` open calabi - yau manifold ' since it has a nowhere vanishing holomorphic 1-form @xmath1 that has only logarithmic poles at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the following enumerative problem and show that the resulting functions are equal to bosonic partition functions on @xmath0 .",

    "we consider @xmath0 as @xmath6 and take distinct points @xmath7 and sufficiently small circles @xmath8 and @xmath9 around @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",

    "then we define @xmath16 to be the number of isomorphism classes of quadruples @xmath17 where :    * @xmath18 is a possibly non - connected smooth curve , * @xmath19 is a finite covering that is simply ramified over @xmath20 ( i.e. , exactly one branch maps with degree 2 ) and unramified elsewhere , and * @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    here , an isomorphism of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an isomorphism @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
