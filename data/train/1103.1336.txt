    "in the present supplementary appendix we present a derivation of the quantum kinetic equations for the system of cavity polaritons coupled with a terahertz ( thz ) cavity mode based on the lindblad approach for the density matrix dynamics . the method",
    "we develop is general and can in principle be applied to any system of interacting bosons in contact with a phonon reservoir , for example , a polaritonic channel [ 18,19 ] or a condensate of indirect excitons .",
    "the system of polaritons , phonons and thz cavity photons is described by its density matrix @xmath33 , for which we apply born approximation factorizing it into the phonon part which is supposed to be time - independent and corresponds to the thermal distribution of acoustic phonons @xmath78 , and the part describing polaritons and thz cavity photons @xmath79 whose time dependence should be determined .",
    "@xmath80 . our aim is to find dynamic equations for the time evolution of the occupancies of the upper and lower polariton states and the thz cavity mode : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are operators of the upper and lower polaritons ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively ) and thz cavity photons ( @xmath86 ) . in our consideration we neglect spin of the cavity polaritons since out goal is to find the effects of bistability and switching in the thz emitter and spin degree of freedom is not expected to introduce any qualitatively new physics from this point of view .",
    "it should be noted , however , that introduction of spin into the model is straightforward .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system can be represented as a sum of two parts @xmath87 where the first term @xmath88 describes the `` coherent '' part of the evolution , corresponding to free polaritons , cavity photons and polariton - polariton interactions , and the second term @xmath89 corresponds to the dissipative interaction with acoustic phonons .",
    "the two terms affect the polariton density matrix in a qualitatively different way .",
    "the effect of the coherent part on the evolution of the density matrix is described by the liouville - von neumann equation @xmath90 \\label{liouville}\\ ] ] polariton - phonon scattering corresponds to the interaction of the quantum polariton system with a classical phonon reservoir .",
    "it is of dissipative nature , and thus straightforward application of the liouville - von neumann equation is impossible .",
    "introduction of dissipation into quantum systems is an old problem , for which there is still no single well established solution . in the domain of quantum optics , however , there are standard methods based on the master equation techniques . in the following we give a brief outline of this approach applied for a dissipative polariton system .",
    "the hamiltonian of interaction of polaritons with acoustic phonons in dirac representation can be represented as @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the operators for polaritons , @xmath93 are the operators for phonons , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the dispersion relations of polaritons and acoustic phonons respectively , @xmath96 are the polariton - phonon coupling constants . in the last equality we separated the terms @xmath97 where a phonon is created , containing the operators @xmath98 , from the terms @xmath99 in which it is destroyed , containing operators @xmath100 .",
    "now , one can consider a hypothetical situation when polariton - polariton interactions are absent , and all redistributions of the polaritons are due to the scattering with a thermal reservoir of acoustic phonons .",

    "<S> spontaneous emission rate can be increased by application of purcell effect when emitter of thz is placed in cavity for thz mode @xcite , but even in this case cryogenic temperatures are required to provide quantum efficiency of the order about one percent for typical quantum cascade structure .    </S>",
