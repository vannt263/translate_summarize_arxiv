    "the nature of dark energy ( de ) is one of the main puzzles of cosmology .",
    "de was first required by snia data [ 1 ] , but a _ flat _ universe with @xmath2 and @xmath3 is also favored by cbr and lss observations [ 2,3 ] ( @xmath4 : matter , baryon density parameters ; @xmath5 : hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc ; cbr : cosmic background radiation ; lss : large scale structure ) .    de could be a false vacuum ; then , its pressure and energy density ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) have ratio @xmath8 .",
    "this however requires a severe fine tuning at the end of the ew transition .",
    "otherwise , de can be a scalar field @xmath9 self  interacting through a potential @xmath10 ( dynamical de [ 4,5,6 ] )",
    ". then @xmath11 ( derivatives are in respect to the conformal time @xmath12 ) .",
    "as soon as @xmath13 , it is @xmath14 for @xmath15 , it is @xmath16 and dynamical de approaches an open cdm behavior .",
    "smaller @xmath17 ratios approach @xmath18 and a @xmath1cdm behavior . to work out @xmath19 , the friedman equations , together with the equation of @xmath9 , are to be integrated ; the solutions depend on the shape of @xmath20 , which , in principle , is largely arbitrary .    among potentials admitting a _ tracker _ solution , the rp [ 5 ] and sugra [ 6 ] expressions @xmath21 are particularly relevant , as they originate within the frame of supersymmetric ( susy ) theories",
    "here , @xmath1 is an energy scale , set in the interval @xmath22@xmath23gev ; @xmath24 is the planck mass .",
    "once @xmath1 and @xmath25 are fixed , the exponent @xmath26 is set .",
    "rp and sugra potentials yield fast and slowly varying @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "dynamical de and @xmath1cdm often predict similar observational outputs .",
    "this is welcome , as @xmath1cdm is a good fit to data .",
    "however , here we show that measures of anisotropy and polarization of cbr , at large angular scales , constrain @xmath20 and distinguish dynamical de from @xmath1cdm .",
    "accordingly , experiments in progress already exclude some parameter range for rp models and higher sensitivities can discriminate even better . in a previous paper [ 7 ] ,",
    "similar results were provided ; that paper , however , contained a numerical mistake .",
    "here we correct some of its quantitative results .",
    "our procedure includes a likelihood analysis , assuming polarization data provided by the sky polarization observatory [ 8 ] , both with the expected experimental noise level and a higher sensitivity .",
    "results , however , can be straightforwardly extended to other observational contexts .",
    "the angular cbr spectra @xmath28 ( only @xmath29mode is considered through this paper ) can be worked out from the linear fluctuation evolution , obtained by solving the boltzmann equation for the photon distribution .",
    "the treatment is discussed in a number of papers [ 9 ] , giving also the equations for the other components of a model . in this section",
    "we show that these equations , in several cases , yield a low or negative @xmath30 for low @xmath0 .",
    "all definitions used are the same as in cmbfast [ 10 ] .",
    "this effect arises because of the simultaneous action of the isw effect and of the opacity @xmath31 .",
    "( notice that @xmath32 ) ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the free electron density and the thomson cross  section .",
    "isw effect arises when we pass either from matter to curvature dominance ( open models ) or from matter to vacuum dominance ( @xmath1cdm models ) .",
    "however , only in the former case and in the presence of opacity , anticorrelation arises .",
    "some rp models induce anticorrelation because their features more closely approach open cdm , rather than @xmath1cdm .",
    "let us then indicate by @xmath35 and @xmath36 the boltzmann components for anisotropy and polarization ( @xmath37 is the wave  number ) .",

    ".    initially all @xmath38 terms are zero ; to switch them on , the quadrupole @xmath46 must be great when @xmath33 is not so low . for wavelengths @xmath47 entering the horizon well after recombination ,",
    "@xmath46 switch on when @xmath33 has almost vanished , unless reionization occurs .",
    "notice that the horizon size at recombination corresponds to @xmath48 . without reionization , below such @xmath0",
    ", we expect low @xmath38 s .",
    "let @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) be the present value of harmonics .",
    "in spatially flat models , the angular spectra read @xmath51 @xmath52 being the primeval fluctuation spectrum . in open model , instead , they read @xmath53 here @xmath54 .",

    " numbers @xmath67 and @xmath68 are just shifted by @xmath69 .",
    "notice that , in a @xmath1cdm model , no de fluctuations exist while @xmath70 , so that the second term at the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 2.4f ) vanishes . in models with dynamical de , instead , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "accordingly , the second term in square brackets in eq .",

    "this term is analogous to the second term in square bracket in eq .",
    "( 2.4o ) and would coincide with it if @xmath75 and , namely , if @xmath76 .",
    "if this is true , apart of a different power distribution along the @xmath0 axis and geometric effects at greater @xmath0 , there can be similarities in the behavior of open and dynamical de models .",
    "the relation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 can then be studied through the equation @xmath79 , \\eqno ( 2.5)\\ ] ] whose validity indicates that de behaves as a fluid .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate , however , tells us soon that @xmath80 ; then , the ratio between @xmath78 and the r.h.s . is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the scale related to @xmath37 . before horizon",
    "crossing ( @xmath83 ) , the @xmath78 term is negligible , in comparison with the r.h.s .. hence , @xmath77 equates the r.h.s . and , therefore , the ratio @xmath84 exceeds unity . at horizon",
    "crossing such ratio must approach unity and keep such as @xmath12 grows greater than @xmath82 . the main differences between open and dynamical de models , in the r.h.s . of eqs .",
    "( 2.4 ) are therefore relegated to times before horizon crossing .",
    "afterward , the residual difference is due to a factor @xmath85 .",
    "the changes in @xmath86 directly act on @xmath87 .",
    "the equation fulfilled by this spectral component reads : @xmath88    + { k \\over 5 } [ 2\\ , f_1(k , t ) - 3 f_3(k , t ) ] + { 8 \\over 5 } \\left({\\dot \\eta(k , t ) } + { { \\dot h(k , t ) } \\over 6 } \\right ) \\eqno ( 2.6f)\\ ] ] in flat models , while in open models we have : @xmath89   + { \\beta \\over 5 } [ 2 b_2\\ , f_1(\\beta , t ) - 3 b_3 f_3(\\beta , t ) ] + { 8 \\over 5 }   { \\beta \\over k } b_2   \\left({\\dot \\eta(\\beta , t ) } + { { \\dot h(\\beta , t ) } \\over 6 } \\right ) ~. \\eqno ( 2.6o)\\ ] ] accordingly , when open models show negative te correlations at low @xmath0 , we expect something similar in flat rp models .",
    "on the contrary , models like sugra , with a cosmic acceleration closer to @xmath1cdm models , are not expected to give negative te correlation .",
    "let us then discuss how the likelihood distribution can be obtained from model spectra , taking into account that the number of pixels for anisotropy and polarization ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) in our ( artificial ) data are different . let @xmath92 be the anisotropy data measured in @xmath90 pixels and @xmath93 and @xmath94 be the stokes parameters in @xmath91 pixels . in general ,",

    "then , the likelihood of a model , whose angular spectra are @xmath59 , when the data @xmath99 are observed , reads @xmath100^{-{1 \\over 2 } } \\exp   \\big [ -{1 \\over 2}{\\bf d^t } { \\bf m}^{-1 } { \\bf d } \\big ] ~. \\eqno ( 2.7)\\ ] ] the main ingredient of @xmath82 is the correlation matrix @xmath101 ; here @xmath102 is the signal term and @xmath103 is due to the noise .",
    "the components @xmath104 yield the expected correlation between the @xmath105th and @xmath106th elements of data vectors @xmath96 corresponding to particular choices of @xmath107 [ 10 ] .",
    "the construction of the noise term is simpler , as we expect no noise correlation , and the matrix @xmath108 ( for @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 ( for @xmath111 ) is diagonal .",
    "in fig .  1 we show the spectra @xmath30 for @xmath1cdm and rp models , if @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( wmap[11 ] suggests that @xmath114 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath115 is given in top of the frames .",
    "low@xmath0 anticorrelation is found only for @xmath116 and is shown in the third plot",
    ". the differences between @xmath1cdm and rp increase for growing @xmath117 , but are already significant even for @xmath118 .    at low @xmath0 , cosmic variance must be taken into account , aside of instrumental variance .",
    "we then perform a large number ( 1000 ) of realizations of rp sky models for @xmath1192 , 5 and 8 , for @xmath112 and 0.20 . in fig .  2 ( 3 ) we report report results for @xmath112 ( 0.20 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath117 are shown in top of each plot .",
    "lower and upper plots correspond to @xmath120 and 0.2@xmath121k , respectively .",
    "the former value approaches wmap and sport expectations ; the latter value might be approached by the planck [ 12 ] experiment .",
    "these figures show that , as expected , rp models are more easily distinguishable from @xmath1cdm for lower @xmath122 and higher @xmath117 . we can assume that a rp model gives a signal different from @xmath1cdm when @xmath123 is detected .",
    "however , even in the less favorable case considered , when @xmath124k , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , the peak likelihood is at @xmath123 in @xmath127 of cases . for @xmath128 ,",
    "this fraction reaches @xmath129 .",
    "likelihood distributions , averaged both over cosmic and instrimental variances , tell us that rp models begin to be distinguishable from @xmath1cdm , at 1@xmath122 level , for @xmath130 and @xmath131 , if @xmath132k . for @xmath133k , instead , this is already true for @xmath126 .",
    "see the figures for further details .",
    "a general conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that cosmic variance is far from being a serious limit to model parameter detection from large angle spectral analysis , at the present sensitivity levels . even for a sensitivity improved by a factor 10",
