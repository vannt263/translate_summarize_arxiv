    "unified schemes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) invoke the presence of an obscuring dusty torus around the central engine , giving rise to type  1 objects for for pole - on viewing and type  2 objects in edges - on sources .",
    "this obscuring structure would also absorbs a significant fraction of the optical / uv / x - ray continuum of the central source and should radiate back this energy at ir wavelengths .",
    "in fact , dust reprocessing is regarded as the most likely source of the strong near- and mid - infrared ( nir and mir , respectively ) continuum emission in radio - quiet quasars and seyfert galaxies .",
    "observational evidence favoring models in which the ir continuum between 1 and 10  @xmath1 m is predominantly or entirely dominated by emission from heated dust is abundant @xcite .",
    "indeed , evidence of the presence of hot dust near the sublimation temperature in seyfert  1 galaxies comes from the observation of a peak of emission with central wavelength between 2.2@xmath03.5  @xmath1 m found from jhkl and l photometry @xcite in a few objects .",
    "moreover , very recently , @xcite found in the inner 250  pc of mrk  766 , a narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy , this same excess of emission by means of nir spectroscopy .",
    "they were able to determine accurately the form of the nir bump , confirming that it follows a simple blackbody function at t=1200  k. they found that the host dust emission accounted for up to 28% of the total nir continuum flux in that object .",
    "from above , the growing observational evidence of nir thermal emission at temperatures close to the sublimation temperature of graphite grains in seyfert  1 galaxies strongly supports the unified models for agns .",
    "meanwhile , additional evidence is needed and many open questions have to be answered . in particular , it is necessary to investigate if the thermal emission could be related to a compact dust / molecular thick torus like the ones in the unified models of @xcite and @xcite , for instance , or if it results from emission by hot dust ( t@xmath3900  k ) mixed with gas in the nlr / blr interface region , shielded from the intense uv radiation field @xcite .    here , we contribute to this discussion by presenting the most outstanding evidence of a nir bump reported to date .",
    "it corresponds to the one displayed by mrk  1239 , a compact galaxy , classified as narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) by @xcite .",
    "data collected over the past years point out that mrk  1239 is indeed dusty .",
    "@xcite , for instance , reports that it is one of the three galaxies that display the largest percentage of polarization , both in the line and continuum , in the sample of 18 nls1 he studied .",
    "@xcite modeled the polarization nature of this object and found that it was one of the rare cases of seyfert  1 galaxies that appear to be dominated by scattering in an extended region along the poles of the torus . according to their results ,",
    "the line - of - sight to the nucleus would pass through the relatively tenous upper layers of the torus , extinguishing the continuum and blr emission .",
    "this radiation , would be polarized further off by the dust located above or below the torus .",
    "x - rays observations also confirm the dusty nature of mrk  1239 .",
    "xmm - newton epic pn data suggest two light paths between the continuum source and the observer , one indirect scattered one , which is less absorbed , and a highly absorbed direct light path , in agreement to the wavelength - dependent degree of polarization in the optical / uv",
    ". moreover , mrk  1239 is classified as a 60  @xmath1 m peaker @xcite because of its `` warm '' far - infrared colours and spectral energy distribution peaking near 60  @xmath1 m .",
    "they attributed these properties to dust - obscured active galactic nuclei @xcite , the obscuring material likely associated to the putative torus of the unified model .",

    "a 0.8@xmath1015@xmath9 slit , oriented east - west , was used during the observations .",
    "the spectral resolution was 360  kms@xmath5 at both setups .",
    "the total on - source exposure times amount to 1900s and 1200s for the april 21 and 22 , 2002 , and 1200s for the sxd observation of october 24 , 2003 .",
    "the signal within the central 0.8@xmath101@xmath9 ( 1@xmath9=380  pc ) was summed up to obtain the nuclear spectrum .",
    "the light distribution of the galaxy was found to be cuspy , being dominated by the unresolved emission from the agn .",
    "the data reduction , extraction and calibration procedures were done using the in - house software spextool @xcite and xtellcor @xcite , provided by the irtf observatory .",
    "the spectra in the sxd and lxd settings , observed on consecutive nights , were merged to form a single 0.8@xmath04.9  @xmath1 m spectrum .",
    "the agreement in the continuum level in the overlapping region was excellent , with less than 5% of uncertainty .",
    "the sxd spectra obtained in october 2003 also agreed , within 10% of uncertainty , with the continuum level measured in the observation taken in 2002 .",
    "figure  [ mrk1239nir ] show the final nir spectra of mrk  1239 in the rest - frame of the object . in the regions where the atmospheric transmission drops to zero , a straight line was interpolated to connect the adjacent bands .",
    "it can be seen that the nir spectrum is dominated by a strong bump of emission , peaking at 22000   , also present in the october 24 , 2003 observation .",
    "also prominent in the spectra are emission lines of hi , hei and [ siii ] . no absorption lines that may indicate the presence of circumnuclear stellar population were detected .",
    "since the main focus of this work is the continuum emission , the analysis of the line spectra is left for a future publication . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only nir spectroscopy available in the literature on this source is the _",
    "j _ and _ k _ spectra of @xcite .",
    "because of the non - photometric conditions in which they were taken , there is a lack of continuity in the continuum level between the bands , preventing us to make any meaningful comparison .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "2 g of @xcite , the @xmath11 continuum rises toward longer wavelengths . in the @xmath12-band",
    ", it continues rising up to 2.2  @xmath1 m , where it seems to become flat , in accordance to our observations .",
    "in addition to the nir data , long - slit optical spectroscopy on mrk  1239 was obtained on the nights of march 19 and 20 , 2002 , with the cassegrain spectrograph attached to the 2.15  m telescope of the casleo observatory , argentina .",
    "the spectra cover the interval 37009600    and were obtained with a 2@xmath9 slit width and a 300  l / mm grating .",
    "the extraction and reduction process followed the standard iraf procedure .",
    "as in the nir region , the light profile distribution of the galaxy is dominated by the unresolved emission of the agn .",
    "the aim of the optical data is to complement the nir spectrum to map the optical - nir continuum of this source .",
    "no significant variation ( less than 5% ) in the level of the continuum emission was detected in the overlapping region between the optical and nir spectra ( 0.8@xmath00.95  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "in order to properly interpret the strong excess of nir emission in mrk  1239 , it is first necessary to de - redden its optical - nir continuum . to this purpose , we used as reference , the spectrum of the nls1 galaxy ark  564 , whose continuum emission is well known and we assumed as typical of a nls1 galaxy .",
    "flux - calibrated fos hst spectra in the optical region and spex irtf spectra @xcite were employed .",
    "we started by derreddening the ark  564 data by galactic ( e(b - v)=0.03 ) and internal extinction ( e(b - v)=0.14 ) , as determined by @xcite .",
    "the reddening law of @xcite with @xmath13=3.1 was used to this purpose .",
    "then , assuming that the form and slope of the extinction - corrected optical continuum in ark  564 represents the intrinsic continuum of mrk  1239 , we de - reddened the observed spectra of the latter object ( already corrected by a galactic e(b - v ) of 0.065 ) in small steeps until the form of its optical continuum matches that of former .",
    "an e(b - v)=0.54  mag was necessary and was taken as the intrinsic reddening of mrk  1239 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement to the one predicted by the polar scattering region scenario ( e(b - v)@xmath140.36 ) proposed by @xcite if that mechanism becomes the dominant source of polarization .",
    "note that had we used the nir hi line ratios to determine the extinction , we would have obtained zero extinction .",
    "the measured b@xmath15 flux is 2.76@xmath16 erg  @xmath7  s@xmath5 while that of pa@xmath17 is 1.91@xmath18 erg  @xmath7  s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , the ratio b@xmath15/pa@xmath17 equals 0.14@xmath190.01 , somewhat lower than the intrinsic case b value ( 0.17 ) .",
    "this apparent inconsistency can be explained if nir blr hydrogen lines strongly deviates from case b due to collisional and radiation transfer effects , as it the case for the optical lines .",
    "figure  [ optnir ] shows the extinction corrected spectrum of mrk  1239 .",
    "it can be seen that after dereddening , the optical continuum of mrk  1239 has the same steepness as that of ark  564 . note the broad bump of emission starting at @xmath20  @xmath1 m , with peak at 22000   .",
    "it dominates the nir continuum distribution in mrk  1239 but is absent in ark  564 .",
    "figure  [ optnir ] also shows that at @xmath20  @xmath1 m there is a break in the steepness of the continuum . if the uv - optical continuum is well described by the a power - law of the form f@xmath21 , the extrapolation of this function to the nir region lacks of enough power to explain the nir continuum emission . in ark  564 , for instance ,",
    "where the strong bump of emission is not observed , an additional power law is necessary in order to reproduce the nir sed .",
    "if we consider the continuum of ark  564 as typical for a nls1 galaxy , the break represents the end of the long wavelength side of the continuum attributed to the central engine and the onset of the thermal emission from dust grains .",
    "the fact that ark  564 displays a low percentage of polarization @xcite both in line and continuum , indicates that the dust content in the blr of this object is small ( also confirmed by the small value of intrinsic extinction ) .",
    "it means that in ark  564 we are observing the true near - infrared shape of the big blue bump component , which up to date is essentially unknown @xcite .      the continuum emission displayed by mrk1239 in the interval 0.8@xmath04.9",
    "@xmath1 m is complex and rather different from the one displayed by other nls1 galaxies ( see for example , the nir spectra of other agn presented by @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison with the continuum of ark  564 is , in fact , striking .    in order to characterize the nir continuum emission in mrk1239",
    ", we used , as reference , the much simpler optical - nir continuum of ark  564 .",
    "to this purpose , a composite function described by the sum of two power - laws of the form f@xmath21 was fitted to the data using the task _",
    "nfit1d _ of the stsdas package of iraf .",
    "this composite function was chosen because it was clear that a single power - law can not reproduce the optical - nir continuum .",
    "special care was taken to not include emission lines in the spectral windows used in the fit .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ optnir ] .",
    "the derived spectral indices are @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the optical and nir regions , respectively . from figure  [ optnir ] , we see that this composite function can not describe the continuum emission in the 1@xmath04  @xmath1 m region of mrk  1239 .",
    "the strong excess of emission that rises above the level predicted by the optical plus nir power - laws indicates the necessity of an additional component .",
    "= 1210  k that best reproduces the nir bump .",
    "the thick line represent the sum of these three components .",
    "[ powl],width=325 ]    an inspection to the overall shape of the bump suggests that it approaches that of a blackbody distribution . in order to test this hypothesis , we fitted a composite function @xmath0two power - laws , plus a planck curve , to the observed optical - nir sed .",
    "additional constraints to the fit was imposed by adding photometric points for the l ( 3.5  @xmath1 m ) and n ( 10.5  @xmath1 m ) bands , taken from the literature @xcite . in the fit",
    ", the power - law indices were constrained to the values found for ark  564 ( see above ) while the temperature and amplitude of the blackbody function were left as free parameters .",
    "the results , displayed in figure  [ powl ] , show that a composite function , with a blackbody of temperature @xmath24=1210  k , provides an excellent description to the the excess of emission over the power - laws .",
    "it should be noted here that the use of blackbody instead of a greybody is preferred because of the smaller number of free parameters that the former function requieres . in the absence of observational constraints that justifies the use of a more complex function ,",
    "they choice is for the one that offers an adequate solution with the minimum number of parameters to fit .",
    "see also sect .",
    "[ dust ]    what is the origin of each of the three continuum components , all emitted in the inner 380pc of the agn ?",
    "we associate the power - law that dominates the optical region to the long - wavelength side of the uv / optical continuum component , often called the big blue bump ( bbb ) , thought to be emitted from an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "the nir power - law is likely associated to the blue - end tail of the much broader infrared excess that dominates the ir sed of agn , usually attributed to cold dust ( @xmath2540 - 80  k ) , warmer than dust in normal spiral galaxies @xcite , with peak emission at 60  @xmath1 m , and observed in mrk  1239 @xcite .",
    "the third component , well described by a planck function of @xmath261200  k will be examined in the following section .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of a spectroscopic survey of agns in the nir prevents us to determine if that feature is common in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the only reports to date of a similar feature comes from spectroscopy observations of izw1 @xcite , mrk478 @xcite and mrk766 @xcite , notably all nls1 galaxies . in the former two objects ,",
    "an excess of emission redwards of 1.3  @xmath1 m over the underlying featureless continuum , is observed .",
    "the izw1 and mrk478 data , however , are limited to 2.4  @xmath1 m .",
    "it is not possible to say what happens beyond that point .",
    "note that the narrowness of this component turns it difficult to be detected in broad band photometry studies based on iras observations , for instance .",
    "its presence , however , can be confirmed by means of 2mass photometry . in figure",
    "[ powl ] , we have plotted the _ jhk _ fluxes ( full circles ) reported for mrk  1239 , taken from ned .",
    "no photometry is the optical is available .",
    "overall , the photometric points follow the nir excess .",
    "the small overestimation of the photometric _ j _ and _ h _ flux over the spectroscopic one ( @xmath216% ) can be due to line emission ( hi and hei ) and probably , underlying continuum emission from the host galaxy . recall that the 2mass data plotted is extracted from aperture photometry , of radius of 14@xmath9 , which may include contribution from the host - galaxy .",
    "the adequate representation of the nir bump by a blackbody distribution leads us to propose that it is due to emission from hot dust grains .",
    "the temperature derived from the fit , @xmath24=1200  k , is close to the evaporation temperature of graphite grains , t@xmath21500k , and higher than the sublimation temperature of silicate grains ( t@xmath21000  k ; @xcite ) . considering that our spatial resolution is limited to @xmath2380  pc , it is very likely that dust at higher temperatures exists closer to the central source , ruling out the possibility of silicates as the main component of the nuclear dust grains .",
    "using the temperature of the blackbody as the average temperature of the graphite grains and a _ k _ band flux of 5.93@xmath810@xmath27 erg s@xmath5 @xmath7 hz@xmath5 at 2.2@xmath1 m found for the blackbody component after subtracting the underlying composite power - laws , we can roughly estimate the dust mass associated with the bump .",
    "following @xcite , the infrared spectral luminosity , in ergs s@xmath5 hz@xmath5 , of an individual graphite grain is l@xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the grain radius , @xmath30 is the absorption efficiency of the grains and @xmath31 is the planck function for a grain of temperature @xmath32 . adopting , as in @xcite , a value of @xmath29=0.05  @xmath1 m for graphite grains and @xmath33=0.058 and setting @xmath32=1220  k , we find @xmath34=9.29@xmath810@xmath35 ergs s@xmath5 hz@xmath5",
    ".    the total number of emitting grains ( hot dust ) can be approximated as n@xmath36 .    finally , for graphite grains , with density @xmath37=2.26 g  @xmath38 , m@xmath39 .",
    "taking mrk  1239 at a distance of 79.7 mpc ( z=0.00199 , h@xmath4=75  kms@xmath5/mpc ) , we obtained @xmath40=4.51@xmath41 and @xmath42=2.7@xmath43  m@xmath44 .",
    "table  [ masses ] compares the mass of hot dust derived for mrk  1239 to that found in other agns .",
    "our calculations show that mrk  1239 harbors the second largest mass of hot dust reported to date in the literature for an agn , only surpassed by ngc  7469 .",
    "note , however , that except for mrk  766 , all other previous measurements are based on photometric data , which do not take into account the underlying featureless continuum that we subtracted .",
    "had we used the peak flux of the continuum , we would have obtained a value of 5.3  m@xmath44 , ranking mrk  1239 as the agn with the largest content of hot dust found to date . the presence of dust near to sublimation temperature in mrk  1239",
    "has been largely predicted by dust emission models .",
    "in fact , the onset of the broad strong bump of emission at 1@xmath1 m , with peak at @xmath45 m , is set by the dust sublimation temperature of graphite grains at t@xmath21500  k. why in mrk  1239 exists such a large amount of hot dust , to the extent of creating a noticeable shoulder in the much broader ir sed attributed to warm dust , can not be tell from our data .",
    "no doubt that mrk  1239 is an excellent target to be studied spectroscopically with spitzer in order to study the broad band ir emission of this object .",
    ".masses of hot dust found in agns [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     regarding to the location of the hot dust , our aperture size implies that it must reside within the inner 380pc from the centre .",
    "however , the high temperature of the dust imposes a tighter constraint to the location of its emitting region : the inner 100pc .",
    "this value is deduced by inspecting fig .  3 of @xcite , where a plot of dust temperature as function of distance from the nucleus was constructed for ngc  7469 .",
    "note that we have assumed that the dust in mrk1239 has similar properties to that of ngc  7469 .",
    "further support to this distance can be obtained following the results for ngc  1068 @xcite .",
    "these authors concluded that hot dust ( @xmath32=1500  k ) should be extremely confined and located at a radius less than 4  pc .",
    "although the precise location of the hot dust can not be distinguished from our data , both scenarios are in accord to the polar scattering model of @xcite .",
    "likely , the combined effect of hot dust associated to the outer layers of the torus and the inner hot dust of the polar scattering cone contribute to enhance the bump observed in mrk  1239 .",
    "in fact , 10  @xmath1 m imaging of this object presented by @xcite shows clear evidence of bright extended emission in a cone - like structure , with the apex of the cone located at the nucleus .",
    "although evidence of this extended emission is not seen in our data , we especulate that the hottest dust component should indeed contribute to the observed bump .",
    "no doubt , our results provides the first direct spectroscopic evidence of hot dust in agn and show the potential that nir spectroscopy has at unveiling that component .",
    "if the strong nir excess observed in mrk  1239 is indeed thermal emission from very hot dust , one can ask why we only see emission at a single temperature if one would expect a range of temperatures ? in that case , the nir excess should resemble more closely to a sum of blackbody curves of decreasing temperatures . this question can be answered if we remember that the ir emission in mrk  1239 is largely dominated by a much stronger bump , peaking at 60  @xmath1 m ( see , for example , figure  7 of @xcite , where the broadband continuum of this source is presented ) , indicating that a large interval of dust temperatures indeed dominates the bulk of the ir emission over the hot one .",
    "in this letter we have reported the first discovery of an isolated nir bump of emission in the nls1 galaxy mrk  1239 .",
    "the continuum steeply rises toward longer wavelengths redward of 1  @xmath1 m , peaking at 2.2  @xmath1 m , where it starts to fall smoothly with wavelength .",
    "this excess of emission dominates the region between 1 - 5  @xmath1 m . after comparing the optical continuum with that of ark  564",
    ", we found that the continuum in mrk  1239 is reddened by e(b - v)=0.54 , appreciably larger for a type  1 object .",
    "this result agrees with polarimetry data , which points out towards a dusty polar scattering region . in order to adequately reproduce the nir continuum , a planck distribution of t@xmath21200",
    "k is needed to account for the strong excess of emission over a featureless continuum of power - law form .",
    "we interpreted this component in terms of very hot dust , near its sublimation temperature , very likely located both in the upper layers of torus and close to the apex of the polar scattering region .",
    "if our hypothesis is correct , we have provided additional spectroscopic evidence of the presence of the putative torus of the unified model of agns .",
