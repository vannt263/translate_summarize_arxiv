    "we examine the dynamics of a spatially - localized wave propagating along a chain of particles , where the dynamics of each particle is governed by an interaction potential between it and its nearest neighbors .",

    "classical examples of lattice systems such as the toda lattice have been studied extensively both because of their intrinsic theoretical interest and because they play important roles in several applications , including nonlinear optical propagation @xcite and electrical propagation through transmission lines @xcite .",
    "the toda - lattice equations also provide a paradigmatic example of a discrete integrable system .",
    "consequently , properties associated with the integrability of the toda - lattice equations have been the subject of numerous studies . in particular",
    ", the integrability of the toda lattice allows it to support soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have considered `` uniform '' one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice , which are chains in which each particle in the lattice is identical .",
    "however , particles need not be identical , and examinations of such `` heterogenous '' lattices @xcite , with either periodic @xcite or random @xcite distributions of different particles , reveal a wealth of fascinating dynamics that do not arise in uniform lattices .",
    "such dynamics include new families of solitary waves that have been observed in diatomic granular chains and which can exist only for discrete values of the ratio between the masses of the two particles in a dimer unit @xcite .    in the present study , we apply asymptotic techniques to consider the behavior of propagating waves in diatomic ( i.e. , `` period-2 '' ) lattices , in which two different types of structures alternate with each other .",
    "specifically , we consider bidisperse lattice systems , in which there are two different types of particles , that consist of alternations between a single heavy particle and a single light particle .",
    "see figure [ f : intropic ] for a schematic .",
    "the primary purpose of our paper is to investigate the behavior of solitary waves in the period-2 toda lattice in the limit in which the ratio between the heavy and light particles becomes small ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) .",
    "in particular , motivated by previous numerical and experimental studies @xcite , we will study solutions to these period-2 toda lattice systems that demonstrate nonlocal solitary waves ( i.e. , so - called `` nanopterons '' ) .",
    "one of the earliest investigations of the 2-periodic toda lattice was a numerical study of the near - integrable properties of the system by casati & ford @xcite .",
    "this study showed that the diatomic system behaves as a near - integrable system for values of the mass ratio @xmath1 ( where we note that the system is integrable for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) if the total system energy is below some critical threshold , which depends on the mass ratio .",
    "if the total energy in the system exceeds this threshold , then the system transitions from near - integrable to chaotic behavior .",
    "however , for the purposes of the present study , we treat the system as near - integrable , as we only consider small mass ratios ( @xmath4 ) , and then the threshold energy tends to infinity as the system nears the integrable behavior associated with @xmath2 .",

    "that is , the difference between a traditional solitary wave and a nanopteron is that the latter are localized spatially only up to these small oscillations of non - decaying amplitude typically , these oscillations have exponentially small amplitude in the limit of some small parameter in a system , and this causes the oscillations to be invisible to standard asymptotic power - series asymptotic methods . to analyze these oscillations asymptotically ,",
    "it is necessary to use exponential asymptotic techniques . in figure",
    "[ f : nanoptera ] , we illustrate different types of nanoptera and compare them to standard solitary waves .    exponential asymptotic techniques , such as those developed in @xcite , can be used to capture the exponentially - small oscillations associated with nanoptera .",

    "in the present paper , we apply exponential asymptotic methods to lattice systems to obtain asymptotic solutions containing nanoptera in period-2 toda chains ( as well as more general diatomic particle systems ) .",

    "we perform all asymptotic analysis on the spatially - discrete system ( i.e. , without using any continuum or quasi - continuum approximations ) .",
    "we also determine a set of conditions that guarantee the existence of nanopteron solutions for a period-2 chain with a general interaction potential , and we show that a particular system describing a chain of beads with hertzian nearest - neighbor interactions fails to satisfy these conditions .",

    "we also require boundary conditions at @xmath16 and as @xmath17 .",
    "we will make these conditions explicit for the case of diatomic lattices .",
    "there have been many studies of systems of the form that ask whether the equations admit solitary - wave solutions in the form of a spatially - localized wave that travels through the system without decaying or changing form .",
    "solitary wave solutions have been found in many well - known particle chain systems , such as the toda lattice @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study periodic heterogenous chains in which the component particles have different mass .",
    "in particular , as we illustrate with a schematic in figure [ f : intropic](b ) , we examine period-2 particle chains in which particles of different masses alternate with each other .",
    "we suppose that the mass ratio @xmath18 is small , so that @xmath4 . ( we thus say that particle 1 is",
    "the `` heavy '' particle and particle 2 is the `` light '' particle . ) imposing this configuration and scaling the system yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , are the displacement of the heavy and light particles , and the mass ratio is @xmath22 .",
    "we illustrate this configuration in figure [ f : alternatingpic ] .",
    "to fully specify the solution to the system ( [ 0:2p1],[0:2p2 ] ) , we also need initial conditions for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and their first - order time derivatives .",
    "see section [ s:2.1 ] for a discussion of these initial conditions .",
    "finally , we specify the spatial boundary conditions as @xmath17 so that they are consistent with the initial conditions in the same limit .",

    "consequently , one can obtain solutions to the @xmath23 version of the system ( [ 0:2p1],[0:2p2 ] ) by appropriately scaling solutions to the original nearest - neighbor equation .",

    "we see that the late - order terms of the resulting asymptotic series diverge as the ratio between a factorial and the increasing power of a function @xmath54 . noting the factorial - over - power form in , chapman et al .",
