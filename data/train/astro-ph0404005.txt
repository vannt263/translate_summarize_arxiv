    "high - redshift damped lyman-@xmath5  systems ( dlas ) are the highest column density class of qso absorption lines .",
    "defined by @xmath10 ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) , these systems are thought to trace the interstellar medium ( ism ) of high - redshift galaxies . dedicated surveys over the past two decades",
    "have helped trace the global properties of high - redshift dlas , including their contribution to the cosmological baryon density ( storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ; prochaska & herbert - fort 2004 ) , their chemical enrichment ( e.g. , prochaska et al .",
    "2003 ) , their dust content ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) , and molecular fraction ( ledoux , petitjean , & srianand 2003 ) .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that the dlas have a baryonic mass density comparable to the mass density of modern galaxy disks , that the metallicity of high-@xmath11 dlas is slowly increasing , and that the majority of dla sight lines have low dust - to - gas ratios and molecular fractions .",
    "understanding the detailed physics of the ism in dlas is an important step in understanding high - redshift galaxies in general .",
    "wolfe , prochaska , & gawiser ( 2003a ) have constructed detailed models for the thermal equilibrium of the ism in a set of dlas , calculating the heating rate experienced by the gas due to the ultraviolet emission from young hot stars .",
    "they used observations of absorption out of the @xmath2  level of c@xmath1ii  ( hereafter c@xmath1ii@xmath6 )  a direct indicator of the cooling rate through [ c@xmath1ii ] 158 @xmath12 m emission ( pottasch , wesselius , van duinen 1979 )  to infer the actual heating rate experienced by the gas ( assuming thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "their comparison of the inferred and calculated heating rates suggests dlas harbor significant star formation .",
    "the models of wolfe et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) required that the observed c@xmath1ii@xmath6  in dlas arise in a cold neutral medium ( cnm ) , i.e. , in gas with temperatures @xmath13 k ; their wnm models give sfrs that violate observations of the bolometric background .",
    "the detection of @xmath14  absorption in some high-@xmath11  dlas is further evidence that at least some of these systems contain a cnm ( ledoux et al .",
    "2003 ; hirashita & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "however , such temperatures are at odds with 21-cm absorption studies ; all @xmath15 dlas searched for 21-cm absorption show @xmath16k ( @xmath7 ) ( kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) .",
    "wolfe et al . ( 2003b ) argue that this discrepancy is likely due to the differing properties of the sight lines probed by the optical background sources and by the more extended radio sources .    in this letter",
    "we present a method for determining the kinetic temperature of interstellar matter based solely on basic atomic physics .",
    "our method compares the excitation of the upper @xmath2   fine - structure levels in si@xmath1ii  and c@xmath1ii , which have excitation energies that differ by a factor of four .",
    "we describe our approach in  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we apply this technique to the @xmath17 dla toward the quasar pss  1443 + 27  in  [ sec : psscnm ] , demonstrating that this dla contains a substantial reservoir of cold gas .",
    "lastly , we discuss the implications of this temperature determination in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we discuss how analysis of the @xmath0 fine structure excitation in si@xmath1ii  and c@xmath1ii  can be used to limit interstellar kinetic temperatures .",
    "srianand & petitjean ( 2000 ) have used a similar analysis to limit temperatures and densities in an associated absorber .",
    "silva & viegas ( 2002 , hereafter sv ) give a detailed summary of the excitation equilibrium of fine structure lines in dlas .",
    "we treat the excitation of the @xmath0 fine structure states as a two - level atom .",
    "the equilibrium ratio of the densities in the upper and lower levels ( spitzer 1978 ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , is @xmath22 the quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25  are the familiar einstein transition probabilities .",
    "the energy density of the cosmic microwave background , @xmath26 , for direct excitation of the transitions is calculated assuming a standard cosmology , i.e. , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 k ( mather et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the fluorescent rates @xmath29 due to the great opacity of the ground - state transitions of interest ( sarazin , rybicki , & flannery 1979 ; see wolfe et al .",
    "the summations describe excitations and deexcitations with collision partners @xmath30(@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and h@xmath33 ) , where @xmath34 is the particle density of each partner and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the maxwellian - averaged collision rate coefficients for excitation and deexcitation . the collision rates are related to one another and to @xmath37 , the collision strength ( spitzer 1978 ) , by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy of the @xmath2  level above the ground state , and @xmath40 is the gas kinetic temperature .",
    "we adopt atomic data from the same sources as sv throughout .    the column density of material in the @xmath2  level of c@xmath1ii  is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the gas - phase abundance of carbon , @xmath43  is the density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath44 is the differential pathlength along the line of sight , and the ratio @xmath45 is a function of four quantities : @xmath46 , @xmath43 , @xmath47 , and @xmath40 ( eqn . [ eqn : populations ] ) .",
    "we have assumed @xmath48 , consistent with limits on in dlas ( see figure 12 of wolfe et al .",
    "a similar expression applies for si@xmath1ii@xmath6 .",
    "the column densities of c@xmath1ii@xmath6  and si@xmath1ii@xmath6  are therefore density- and excitation - weighted integrals over pathlength .    to understand the usefulness of si@xmath1ii@xmath6  and c@xmath1ii@xmath6  to limit gas temperatures , imagine that the excitation of the @xmath2  states were only due to electron collisions and deexcitation due to spontaneous emission .",
    "in this case @xmath49 \\times [ \\omega_{12}^e(t)_{\\rm    si}/\\omega_{12}^e(t)_{\\rm c } ] \\times \\exp\\{-(t_{12}^{\\rm si } - t_{12}^{\\rm c})/t\\}$ ] , i.e. , the ratio is only a function of temperature and the si / c ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows the ratio @xmath50  as a function of temperature , including all of the terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : populations ] ) , for several densities at @xmath51 assuming [ si / c]=0.@xmath52 . ]",
    "@xmath50 varies slowly with temperature for @xmath53 k ( for all but the highest densities ) and more strongly at lower temperatures .",
    "the sensitivity to density is modest , especially for low @xmath54 , because the populations of the @xmath2  levels of si@xmath1ii  and c@xmath1ii  depend on density in a similar manner .",
    "we use the ratio of the @xmath2  to @xmath55  levels of c@xmath1ii  and si@xmath1ii  to constrain the allowable range of densities .",
    "gas at @xmath56 k produces ratios @xmath57 ; the corresponding optical depth ratio of the 1264.738   line of si@xmath1ii@xmath6  to the typically - unresolved 1335.663 and 1335.708   doublet of c@xmath1ii@xmath6  is @xmath58 ( @xmath59-values from morton 2003 ) .",
    "thus , the use of this ratio to distinguish cool from warm temperatures requires large c@xmath1ii@xmath6  optical depths and good s / n at si@xmath1ii@xmath6 .",
    "observations of @xmath50  will allow a range of parameters @xmath60 , and @xmath40 , which apply to the c@xmath1ii@xmath6-bearing gas .",
    "however , the maximum allowable temperature can be low if the limits on @xmath50  are low .",
    "prochaska et al . ( 2001 ) present high - resolution ( @xmath61 ) , high s / n observations of the @xmath4 dla  toward of the quasar pss  1443 + 27   using hires ( vogt et al .",

    "our limit to si@xmath1ii@xmath6  was determined using an empirically - measured signal - to - noise ratio ( following sembach & savage 1992 ) and includes continuum placement uncertainties .",

    "( [ eqn : populations ] ) and ( [ eqn : cstarcolumn ] ) and assuming [ si / c]@xmath69 .",
    "the hypothesis that c@xmath1ii@xmath6  absorption toward pss  1443 + 27   arises in a canonical wnm is not consistent with the observations .    to limit @xmath40",

    "@xmath75 values are allowable , and only t is stringently constrained in our analysis . ]",
    "the allowable range of physical conditions in the pss  1443 + 27  dla then depends upon the ratios of si / c and c / fe , which are used for determining the expected @xmath50  and @xmath76 , respectively .",

    "nucleosynthetic effects are unlikely to modify the c / fe ratio , as a roughly solar value is found in low - metallicity milky way stars ( e.g. , carretta , gratton , & sneden 2000 )",
    ". however , nucleosynthetic effects could enhance @xmath5 element abundances , leading to high si / c ratios ( see , e.g. , prochaska 2004 ) .",

    "the overall metallicity of this absorber is [ si / h]@xmath86 , however , which is significantly lower than the metallicity of the dla studied in this work .",
    "the presence of dust will raise the c / fe ratio due to differential depletion .",
    "the depletion of fe in dlas is typically modest , similar to the `` halo '' and `` disk - halo '' clouds in the milky way ( savage & sembach 1996 ) with [ fe / h]@xmath87.@xmath88 .",
    "thus , unlike the case in dlas , the sub - solar gas - phase fe / h quoted here is due entirely to depletion into dust grains .",

    "thus , we expect [ c / fe]@xmath90 . in low - depletion milky way clouds , and by extension dlas ,",
    "si is likely not depleted much differently from c , and we assume [ si / c]@xmath91 .",
    "the small number of species for which measurements are possible in the dla toward pss  1443 + 27  make it difficult to judge the degree of fe depletion .",
    "moderate depletion is suggested by [ si / fe]@xmath92 , but this could also result from @xmath5-enhanced abundances .",
    "we give temperature limits for the c@xmath1ii@xmath6-bearing gas in the @xmath93 dla  toward pss  1443 + 27  for six different abundance assumptions in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "the first three assume [ si / c]@xmath69 with [ c / fe]@xmath94 , + 0.3 , and + 0.6 , allowing for modest levels of depletion .",
    "the next three assume [ si / c]@xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath5-enhanced abundances ( see prochaska 2004 ) .",
    "we note that the model in which [ si / c]@xmath96[c / fe]@xmath97 is not self - consistent : scaling both si@xmath1ii  and fe@xmath1ii  by solar abundances gives inconsistent values for the c@xmath1ii  column density .",

    "this is likely an extreme assumption for the c / fe ratio .",
    "the highest temperature limit for @xmath5-enhanced abundances , which we prefer due to the distribution of [ si / fe ] at very low metallicities ( where dust depletion effects are likely small ; see prochaska 2004 ) , is @xmath9 k. temperatures above 1400 k , consistent with @xmath100 limits for the @xmath101 dlas observed at 21-cm ( kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) , require [ c / fe]@xmath102 to + 0.8 for both solar and @xmath5-enhanced abundances .",
    "we feel this is inconsistent with our knowledge of differential depletion in the milky way and dlas .",

    "we have applied this method to limit the properties of the c@xmath1ii@xmath6-bearing gas in the @xmath4 dla toward pss  1443 + 27 .",
    "we rule out the hypothesis that the c@xmath1ii@xmath6  absorption arises in a wnm .",

    "1995 ) in a high - redshift dla   is significant : while the gas seen in this dla is likely not associated with the dense star - forming clouds , our result demonstrates that the physical conditions of the ism in this system do not preclude the existence of cold material , including , in principle , the dense clouds from which stars could form .",
    "the detection of a cnm in the z=4.224 absorber toward pss 1443 + 27 is the first detection at such a large redshift .",
