    "the bianchi models are spatially homogeneous spacetimes which admit a group of motions @xmath0 @xcite acting on spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "these spacetimes include the non - isotropic generalizations of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time and have been used in the discussion of anisotropies in a primordial universe and its evolution towards the observed isotropy of the present epoch jacobs , narlikar - hoyle - misner    the simplest type of these spacetimes are the bianchi i models for which @xmath0 is the abelian group of translations of the three dimensional euclidian space @xmath1 . in synchronous coordinates the metric of bianchi i spacetimes is : @xmath2where @xmath3 are functions of the time coordinate only and the corresponding kvs are @xmath4 .",
    "when two of the metric functions are equal , e.g. @xmath5 , a bianchi i spacetime ( sx1.1 ) reduces to the important class of locally rotational symmetric ( lrs ) spacetimes @xcite .    a conformal killing vector ( ckv ) @xmath6 is defined by the requirement @xmath7 and reduces to a killing vector ( kv ) ( @xmath8 ) , to a homothetic killing vector ( hv ) ( @xmath9 ) , and to a special conformal killing vector ( sckv ) ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the effects of these vectors can be seen at all levels of general relativity , that is , geometry , kinematics and dynamics . at the geometry level",
    "the knowledge of a ckv makes possible the choice of coordinates so that the metric is simplified , in the sense that one of the metric components is singled out @xcite . at the level of kinematics",
    "the ckvs impose restrictions on the kinematic variables ( rotation , expansion and shear ) and produce well known results ( see for example maartens - mason - tsamparlis , mason - maartens , maartens - maharaj - tupper , coley - tupper1 ) . finally at the level of dynamics",
    "the ckvs can ( and have ) been used in various directions , for example to obtain new solutions of the field equations with ( hopefully ) better physical properties ( see for example coley - tupper1,coley - tupper2,coley - tupper3,coley - tupper4,herrera - leon ) .",
    "it becomes evident that it is important that we know the conformal algebra of a given spacetime .    in @xcite",
    "all lrs spacetimes which admit ckvs have been determined . in the following",
    "we determine all bianchi i spacetimes which are not reducible to lrs  spacetimes and admit ckvs .",
    "the general bianchi i spacetime ( [ sx1.1 ] ) does not admit ckvs .",
    "however , as we will show , there are two families of bianchi i spacetimes which admit ckvs .",
    "one family consists of the conformally flat bianchi i spacetimes , which admit 15 ckvs and are conformally related to rebouas and tiommo ( rt ) and rebouas and teixeira ( art ) @xcite ) spacetimes .",
    "the second family contains the not conformally flat bianchi i spacetimes , which admit only one proper ckv . in the determination of the ckvs we use the bilyanov - defrise - carter theorem which relates the conformal algebra of conformally related metrics ( for details",
    "see @xcite @xcite ) .    in the literature",
    "one finds very few cases of bianchi i spacetimes which admit proper ckvs .",
    "for example even the ckv found by maartens and mellin @xcite is really a ckv in an lrs spacetime and not in a bianchi i spacetime @xcite .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that the direct solution of the conformal equations in bianchi i spacetimes is a major task .",
    "thus an alternative simpler method is needed to solve this problem and this is what it is developed in the following sections .",
    "it is to be noted that using the petrov classification and the bilyanov - defrise - carter theorem mcintosh and steele @xcite have determined all vacuum bianchi i spacetimes which admit a homothety .",
    "one extra advantage of the proposed method is that one can use it to prove / test if a given bianchi i spacetime admits a ckv or not .",
    "for example as it will be shown the two well known anisotropic bianchi i solutions that is , the kasner solution @xcite and the anisotropic dust solution@xcite , which have formed the basis of many studies of anisotropic universes , do not admit a proper ckv ; in particular the kasner spacetime admits a hv .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ preliminaries ]",
    "we present two propositions required for the computation of the ckvs in bianchi i spacetimes . in sections",
    "[ classac ] and [ classbc ] we apply the results of section [ preliminaries ] and we determine all bianchi i spacetimes which admit ckvs . in section [ exact ]",
    "we consider the application of these results in various bianchi i metrics found in the literature .",
    "finally in section [ dis ] we discuss our results .",
    "as it has been remarked in the last section the computation of ckvs of bianchi i spacetimes by direct solution of the conformal equations is a difficult task .",
    "thus we have developed an indirect method which is based on the two propositions discussed below .",
    "the first is proposition [ prop21 ] which has been given in @xcite for spacetimes ( @xmath11 ) and below is generalized dimensions is similar to the one for @xmath11 and we omit it . ] to @xmath12- dimensional riemannian spaces as follows .",
    "[ prop21 ] a decomposable @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) riemannian space @xmath15 with line element ( greek indices take the values 1, ... ,n and latin indices the values 0, ... ,n ) @xmath16admits a proper ckv @xmath6 if and only if the @xmath17 space @xmath18 admits a gradient proper ckv  @xmath19 .",
    "in particular the two vector fields are related as follows@xmath20where :    - @xmath21 is a non vanishing constant ,    - @xmath22 is the conformal factor of the ckv @xmath19 and satisfies the condition@xmath23that is , @xmath24 is a gradient ckv of the @xmath25 space    - @xmath26 satisfies the linear second order equation @xmath27where @xmath28 .    - @xmath29 is a kv or a hv of the @xmath25 metric @xmath30    from proposition [ prop21 ] follows that a proper ckv of the @xmath25 metric @xmath31 generates two proper ckvs for the @xmath12 metric @xmath15 .",
    "the crucial result of proposition [ prop21 ] is that the gradient ckvs of the @xmath32 space are of the specific form ( [ sx2.0b ] ) . furthermore if the @xmath32 space has constant _ non vanishing _",
    "ricciscalar @xmath33 , then the constant @xmath21 is given by the expression @xmath34    the second proposition [ prop22 ]  concerns the @xmath35 decomposable spacetimes which admit ckvs is given in appendix [ appendixa ] ] .",
    "[ prop22 ] the metric ( [ sx2.1 ] ) is conformally flat if and only if the @xmath32 metric @xmath36 is the metric of a space of constant curvature ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "in addition to these propositions we recall the following result ( see tsamp - nikol - apost )    _ the metric of a space of constant non - vanishing curvature _ of dimension _ @xmath12  admits _",
    "@xmath38 _ _  gradient ckvs__.    from proposition [ prop22 ] it follows that as far as the admittance of ckvs is concerned , the connected @xmath39 decomposable spaces are classified in two major classes .",
    "i ) : :    class a : the @xmath39 space is conformally flat .",
    "then the    @xmath32 space is not conformally flat and the    @xmath40space admits @xmath41 ckvs ii ) : :    class b : the @xmath39 space is not conformally flat .",
    "then    the @xmath42 space is not a space of constant curvature .    for a space",
    "conformally related to a @xmath39 decomposable space this classification of ckvs remains the same since all conformally related spaces admit the same conformal algebra .",
    "we conclude that the parameter in the classification of the connected @xmath39 spacetimes which admit ckvs is the constancy or not of the curvature scalar of the @xmath32 space . using this observation and propositions",
    "[ prop21 ] and [ prop22 ] we are able to determine all bianchi i spacetimes which admit ckvs .      in the generic line element ( [ sx1.1 ] ) of bianchi",
    "i spacetime , we consider the coordinate transformation @xmath43 and get@xmath44where @xmath45 is the three dimensional metric @xmath46with @xmath47 ,  @xmath48 . applying a second transformation @xmath49 and @xmath50 the three dimensional metric ( sx4.2 ) becomes@xmath51where@xmath52and @xmath53the two dimensional metric ( [ sx4.5 ] ) is conformally flat metrics are conformally flat . ] .",

    "we set @xmath65 and find that that this is the case when @xmath66 .    on the other hand when @xmath64 is of constant curvature then by means of the inverse of proposition [ prop22 ] the metric @xmath67 is conformally flat",
    "hence the metric @xmath68 is also conformally flat .",
    "we conclude that the classification of bianchi i spacetimes which admit ckvs is done in two classes :    _ class a _ : contains all bianchi i spacetimes which are conformally flat .",
    "according to proposition [ prop22 ] in this case the 3d - metric @xmath69 is of constant curvature and the form of the metric functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 is fixed .",
    "_ class b _ : contains all bianchi i spacetimes which are not conformally flat therefore the decomposable metric is not conformally flat .",
    "according to the inverse of proposition [ prop22 ] in this class the 3-d metric @xmath69 is not the metric of a space of constant curvature .    in class",
    "b there are two cases to be considered.case b1 : the 3d - metric @xmath45 is not conformally flat in which case the scalar curvature of the 2d - metric @xmath72case b2 : the 3d - metric @xmath45 is conformally flat hence according to proposition [ prop22 ] the 2d - metric @xmath73 is of constant curvature i.e. @xmath74    in the following we consider each class and derive the corresponding bianchi i spacetimes together with the ckv(s ) .",
    "we ignore the cases @xmath75 which lead to lrs spacetimes whose ckvs have already been found in @xcite .",
    "demanding that the weyl tensor of the metric ( [ sx4.1 ] ) vanishes we find the following conditions on the metric functions @xmath76 :    @xmath77    where a dot over a symbol denotes differentiation with respect to coordinate @xmath78 .",
    "we note that only two of these three equations are independent .    using  ( [ sx4.14a1])-([sx4.14a3 ] )",
    "we can prove that the 3-metric ( sx4.2 ) is the metric of a 3-space of constant curvature @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is a constant .",
    "there are only two such spacetimes the rt spacetime @xcite and the art spacetime @xcite mentioned above .",
    "the rt and the art spacetimes in isochronous coordinates have the line element@xmath82@xmath83respectively .",
    "these spacetimes are 1 + 3 decomposable spaces whose three dimensional space is a space of constant curvature .",
    "they admit a 15 dimensional conformal algebra with a seven dimensional killing subalgebra , which has been given in @xcite . for the completeness of the paper in appendix [ appendixb ] we give the conformal algebra of the rt and the art spacetimes in a convenient form .",
    "in this class there are two subcases to be considered depending on @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the ricciscalar of the two dimensional space ( sx4.6 ) .      in this case",
    "we are interested only for the kvs and the hv of @xmath88 since if there exist a proper ckv which satisfy condition ( [ sx2.0b ] ) of proposition [ prop21 ] , then the two dimensiona space is of constant curvature . from the ckvs of @xmath89",
    "only the ones which do not contain terms @xmath90 with @xmath91 can satisfy this property .",
    "it is well known that the two dimensional space @xmath92 admits infinity ckvs . however , the vector fields which do not contain the terms @xmath93 with @xmath91 are the two vector fields @xmath94 and the @xmath95 .",
    "the conformal factor of @xmath96 of the metric @xmath88 is : @xmath97    if we demand @xmath98 ( the case of kvs ) then we get @xmath99 , i.e.@xmath100the lrs case which we ignore .",

    "the possible vectors @xmath158 which give @xmath159 are the kvs and the hv which do not contain terms of @xmath160 .",

    "one can apply the results of the last section to determine if a given bianchi i metric admits or not ckvs and at the same time determine the exact form of the ckvs and their conformal factors .",

    "if this condition can not be satisfied for any values of the parameters of the metric then the metric does not admit a ckv otherwise it does .",
    "it is possible that the conformal factors are constants in which case the ckvs reduce to hvs .    before one proceeds with the above it is convenient to compute the weyl tensor and examine if the space is conformally flat or not .",
    "if it is not there is no need to consider the vectors ( [ sx3.6 ] ) , ( [ sx3.8 ] ) , ( sx3.13 ) , ( [ sx3.15 ] ) whereas if it is there is no need to consider the vectors ( [ sx3.22 ] ) , ( [ sx3.25 ] ) .    in the following section we apply the above method to various anisotropic bianchi i metrics which we have traced in the literature .",
    "we present the derivation of the results for the kasner type metrics in some detail whereas the for rest of the metrics we give only the results of the calculations .",
    "the kasner type metrics are defined by the line element : @xmath196 where @xmath197 are different constants ( otherwise the metric reduces to an lrs metric ( two of the constants equal ) or to a frw metric ( all constants equal ) . the well known kasner spacetime - which has been used extensively in the literature in the discussion of anisotropies of the universe - is a vacuum solution of einstein s field equations with the parameters @xmath198 restricted by the relations : @xmath199            we find @xmath208 @xmath209 ( @xmath210 from which we conclude that the kasner type metric ( [ sx3.30 ] ) with @xmath211 admits the hv : @xmath212we emphasize that due to conditions ( [ sx3.31 ] ) the kasner spacetime admits only the hv @xmath213 .",
