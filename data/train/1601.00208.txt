    "exceptions include using quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or gamma ray burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead",
    ", we must rely on using unresolved stellar populations , which have more complicated seds as a result of being composed of many stars of varying spectral types and will depend on the star formation history and the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "in addition , using collections of stars , as opposed to single stars , introduces a wide range of possible geometries for the light sources with respect to the dust .",
    "the nature of this geometry determines the importance of light scattering into the line of sight @xcite , and is the reason that it is important to distinguish between extinction and attenuation .",
    "this additional component has the effect of flattening or `` graying '' the overall effective extinction , due to bluer light experiencing more efficient scattering .",
    "these added complications hinder a general prescription for correcting for dust attenuation in external galaxies .",
    "one exception to the aforementioned problem has been for starburst galaxies , for which a tight positive correlation exists between the slope of the uv flux density , @xmath2 , and the color excess of the nebular gas , @xmath8 , which are both related to the wavelength - dependent attenuation @xcite . the color excess can be inferred using the _ differential _ optical depth of the dust from the balmer decrement , @xmath4 , which we will term `` balmer optical depth '' for sake of brevity .",
    "tight positive correlations also exist between @xmath2 and the ratio of ir to uv luminosity , termed the `` infrared excess '' ( @xmath9 ) , which is a proxy for the total dust attenuation @xcite .",
    "the simple interpretation of the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath10 is that dust attenuation increases with higher dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath11 correlation has been shown to break down as one moves from starburst galaxies to more `` normal '' star forming galaxies ( sfgs ) @xcite .",
    "this breakdown has been attributed to effects of evolved stellar populations , different star formation histories , and variations in the dust / star geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all of which can impact the @xmath10 and/or @xmath2 values and introduce large scatter .",
    "the influence of dust appears to increase at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath12 ) , as the sed of galaxies are more heavily attenuated by dust than in the local universe , corresponding to a larger fraction of the star formation within these galaxies being enshrouded by dust @xcite .",
    "these effects can result in imprecise values of sfrs , stellar mass , extinction corrections , and photometric redshifts of individual galaxies .",
    "uncertainties in the latter two quantities are among the biggest factors limiting current precision dark energy studies , affecting both weak - lensing and supernovae measurements .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to accurately characterize the dust attenuation in galaxies in order to reduce the uncertainties in the interpretation of data in future missions that seek to measure cosmological quantities with unprecedented precision .",
    "in addition , these quantities are crucial for studies of galaxy formation and evolution . understanding the dust attenuation in local sfgs as a function of their properties ( e.g.",
    ", metallicity , stellar mass , sfr ) creates a baseline with which to determine appropriate corrections for higher redshift galaxies .",
    "this will allow for accurate determination of galaxy properties when limited measurements are available , as is typically the case for higher redshift systems .",
    "for their sample of 39 local starburst galaxies , @xcite find a linear correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "this result implies that the dust behaves as a foreground distribution to the ionized gas , because in this scenario the reddening of the stellar continuum linearly correlates with the reddening of nebular regions .",
    "they derive the selective attenuation for this sample by comparing the average seds of galaxies binned according to @xmath4 .",
    "virtually all studies of sfgs , both local and distant , make use of the attenuation curve derived from this sample @xcite to correct for effects of dust and determine properties of those galaxies .",
    "the appeal of this method stems from its simple approach ; determining rest - frame uv colors ( @xmath2 ) , which correspond to observer - frame optical colors for high-@xmath7 galaxies , allows for the dust - free luminosity to be recovered .",
    "however , since the @xcite attenuation curve was calibrated with a relatively small number of local starburst galaxies , it is not clear how accurate such generalizations are to more typical sfgs with lower specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ; @xmath13 ) .",
    "more importantly , the extent to which the relation holds true as a function of redshift has not been conclusively determined .",
    "recent results by @xcite suggest that the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath4 is shallower for galaxies at @xmath14 and is dependent on the ssfr .",
    "they also find that the attenuation curve for these galaxies is lower by about 20% in the uv .",
    "a similar study of a large number of local sfgs will provide a strong foundation with which to compare and address why such differences exist .",
    "other studies have examined the nature of attenuation for large samples of local galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to address the degree to which it can vary",
    ". however , these studies have used different techniques than those described in @xcite , which can introduce different biases and make direct comparison unclear .",
    "more specifically , @xcite use average seds of galaxies separated according to @xmath10 and @xcite utilize a galaxy pair - matching technique ( matched in gas - phase metallicity , ssfr , axial ratio , and redshift ) to compare the seds of more dusty and less dusty galaxies as determined by @xmath4 . despite the different methods for constructing attenuation curves among these studies , a common picture has developed in which the dust content of galaxies appear to have two components ; one associated with short - lived dense clouds where massive stars form hii regions and another associated with the diffuse interstellar medium .    for this study , we follow the methodology used in @xcite to determine the behavior of dust attenuation in a large sample of sfgs with a wide range of properties in order to test the extent to which the dust attenuation and geometry found in that work might hold for a more diverse sample of galaxies .",
    "understanding the geometry of the dust in these systems gives important information on where dust is located in galaxies .",
    "the large sample size will also allow us to examine sources of scatter in the attenuation properties of individual galaxies .",
    "furthermore , our results will allow for more detailed future analysis into the nature of the @xmath11 relationship breakdown for normal sfgs at @xmath15 .    throughout this work",

    "since our analysis requires detection in both the _ galex _ fuv ( @xmath26   ) and nuv ( @xmath27   ) bands , we have chosen to only consider galaxies within the mis catalog because spectroscopic sdss galaxies detected within both bands in the shallower ais are found to be highly biased towards very blue galaxies ( see   [ sample_compare ] for details ) . within the mis catalog , this restricts the parent sample to 63691 galaxies .    for the purpose of this study",

    "the optical spectroscopic measurements for these galaxies are from the max planck institute for astrophysics and johns hopkins university ( mpa / jhu ) group , which is based on the method presented in @xcite .",
    "to summarize , line fluxes are corrected for stellar absorption by fitting a non - negative combination of stellar population synthesis models from for the sdss dr4 and updated in dr7 using a newer version of these models ( unpublished ) .",
    "as recommended by the mpa / jhu group starting with dr4 , we increase the uncertainties associated with each emission line .",
    "we adopt the values listed in @xcite , which are updated for the dr7 dataset .",
    "it has been found by @xcite that the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line of galaxies in the mpa / jhu catalog appear to be underestimated by @xmath0@xmath30    due to their method of correcting balmer absorption .",
    "however , this correction value was derived assuming these galaxies follow the @xcite attenuation curve and because we are seeking to determine if there are significant departures from that relation , we choose not to adopt it .",
    "we have examined the effect of including this correction and found that it causes a systematic decrease in the estimated balmer optical depth of @xmath31 . as was seen in @xcite",
    ", we find this shift to be uniform across the entire range of balmer emission line strengths ( i.e. , @xmath4 values ) .",
    "for this reason , we expect that this will not influence the attenuation curve derived later because only the difference in balmer optical depth is used and not the absolute value .",
    "we require that all emission lines have a signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath32 ) greater than 5 for classification , with the additional constraint that the fuv and nuv measurements have @xmath33 and that the redshift of the galaxy be @xmath34 .",
    "the redshift restriction is required to ensure that the fuv passband ( @xmath351516   , fwhm=269   ) lies above the numerous stellar absorption features that occur below 1250   .",
    "using this selection criteria gives a final sample of 9813 sfgs .",

    "in order to test the existence of any relation between the uv flux density measured by _",
    "galex _ and the optical flux density measured by sdss it is crucial that the apertures be closely matched in order to ensure the they arise from regions of the galaxy that are comparable in size .",
    "this is also essential in order to utilize the seds of these galaxies to derive the underlying attenuation curve .",
    "the limiting factor in this respect is the @xmath25 diameter of the sdss spectroscopic fiber .",
    "this aperture is smaller than the point - spread function ( psf ) of _ galex _ at both fuv ( @xmath46 ) and nuv ( @xmath47 ) . using an aperture which is smaller than _ galex",
    "_ psf would add positional uncertainty that could introduce uv emission unassociated with the fiber location .",
    "however , using an aperture much larger than the psf would require large aperture corrections for our fiber measurements , which would also introduce uncertainty .",
    "in addition , the large psf of _ galex _ can lead to nearby objects contributing to the observed flux density within a given area and using a large aperture would increase the likelihood of this happening . as a compromise between these issues we choose to adopt a @xmath48 diameter aperture for our analysis . the uv photometry and associated uncertainties at this aperture were retrieved directly from the mast database using casjobs .",
    "we note that by adopting a fixed aperture , the physical sizes being probed will vary from sub - kpc at the lowest redshifts up to several kpc at the higher redshifts ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we address the impact of this effect on our results in   [ atten_vs_param ] & [ curve_vs_param ] when we separate the sample according to redshift .",
    "given that the chosen aperture is roughly the size of the psf for the _ galex _ bands , determining the appropriate aperture corrections for the uv is non - trivial as a significant amount of light from outside of the aperture region can be spread within it . to distinguish these effects we utilize the light profile models of sdss galaxies from the nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; * ? ? ?",
    "these profiles are one - component srsic fits of each individual band of sdss , @xmath50 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is an amplitude in nanomaggies / arcsec@xmath52 , @xmath53 is an effective radius in arcsec , and @xmath54 is the srsic index .",

    "if we assume that the uv colors follow the @xmath58-band light profile , which is the shortest wavelength sdss band , then it is possible to determine appropriate aperture corrections for each individual galaxy .",
    "this is done by measuring the amount of light within @xmath48 in the modeled @xmath58-band profile , @xmath59 , and comparing this to the same measurement after the light profile has been convolved with the _ galex _ psfs , @xmath60 .",
    "these psfs are obtained from the _ galex _ data analysis website .",

    "roughly one - third of the sources in our sample are well approximated as point sources in _ galex _ ( corresponding to being near the peak in the distribution ) .",
    "the aperture correction in flux density for a point - source is a factor of 2.29 and 2.86 for fuv and nuv , respectively .",
    "it can be seen in figure  [ fig : galex_aper_corr ] that there are some sources with aperture corrections that are larger than what is expected for a point source ( vertical dashed lines ) . to determine the cause of this interesting behavior we examined the relationship between the aperture corrections with the effective radius of the galaxy and its srsic index in the @xmath58-band .",
    "we choose to use the @xmath62 light radius from the nyu - vagc light profile , @xmath63 , instead of the variable @xmath53 in the srsic fit , as it is a better representation of the size of the galaxy .",
    "we find that the behavior of the aperture correction is directly related to @xmath63 and the srsic index , which we illustrate in figure  [ fig : galex_aper_corr_demo ] and discuss below .",
    "we find that sources with radii of @xmath64 or with @xmath65 and large srsic indices ( i.e. , steep light profile ) are well described by a point - source correction ( see panel ( a ) in figure  [ fig : galex_aper_corr_demo ] ) .",
    "for the regime of galaxies with @xmath66 and small srsic indices ( i.e. , shallow light profile ) , there is little galaxy flux density outside of the @xmath48 aperture to spread inside of it , due to the smearing effect of the psf , but the light within it is being spread out more than would be the case for a point - source .",
    "together these effects result in a larger aperture correction being necessary than would be the case for a point - source ( see panel ( b ) in figure  [ fig : galex_aper_corr_demo ] ) . for galaxies with @xmath67 and small srsic indices",

    "we determine the correction for the observed photometry using the light profile models from the nyu - vagc .",
    "the correction is taken to be the ratio of light within @xmath48 and @xmath69 in the modeled band profile .",
    "we then perform a chi - squared minimization to match the optical spectrum to the @xmath48 photometry .",
    "all nebular line diagnostics used in this study are ratios of emission lines ( @xmath28/h\\alpha$ ] , @xmath29/h\\beta$ ] , and h@xmath43/h@xmath2 ) , and the effects of the aperture corrections are very small .",
    "the reason for this is because the relative difference in the correction terms across the sdss bands is small ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 dispersion of @xmath72 ) . as a check",
    ", we estimated a correction for each the optical emission lines by taking a linear interpolation between the corrections of the two closest bands .",
    "the largest aperture effects for the line ratios will occur for lines which are separated the furthest in wavelength ; which in this study is the ratio of the h@xmath43 to h@xmath2 .",
    "we find that the distribution of the ratio of the aperture corrections for h@xmath43 to h@xmath2 has a mean of @xmath73 , with a @xmath71 dispersion of 0.03 .",
    "this implies these corrections will only change the ratio measurements at the level of a few percent and will be even smaller for the other line ratios ( @xmath74 ) . as these are minor changes we have chosen not to apply any aperture corrections to the emission lines .",
    "as a check on the accuracy of the aperture matching , we compare the corrected uv flux densities to the corrected optical spectra and inspected if the shape of the uv ( inferred from @xmath75 ) agrees with the shortest wavelength data available in the optical spectrum ( @xmath76   , for @xmath77 ) . in other words , we examine whether the region between @xmath78   , corresponding to the gap in our data , that would be extrapolated from the uv slope and the optical data shortward of the 4000    break feature are in agreement .",
    "if our aperture corrections are inaccurate , then we expect to see systematic offsets between the flux densities in the uv and optical . as will be shown with our average templates in ",
    "[ attenuation curve ] , we find that on average the uv data agrees well with the optical data , with no significant offsets between them .",
    "the dust attenuation in a galaxy can be measured from the optical depth , @xmath79 . for the simple case of a uniform layer of dust between a source of intensity , @xmath80 , and the observer ,",
    "the optical depth is defined as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the observed intensity and all quantities are dependent on the wavelength . in the case of a point source such as a star with a well - characterized sed , the optical depth",
    "can easily be determined by comparing the observed and intrinsic seds . however , in the case of entire galaxies for which the underlying sed is strongly affected by many factors , including the underlying stellar population , star formation history , and imf , this becomes much more difficult . to mitigate these problems the flux ratio of h@xmath43 and h@xmath2",
    "is often utilized , as the intrinsic flux ratio is set by quantum mechanics and is only affected by the electron temperature , @xmath83 , and density , @xmath84 , at the @xmath85 level @xcite .",
    "this ratio is also relatively insensitive to the underlying stellar population and imf @xcite .",
    "therefore , large variations from the intrinsic ratio can be directly attributed to the reddening of dust .    for our work we will use the balmer decrement , @xmath86 , as a tracer of dust attenuation , with the assumption that this dust acts as a foreground screen for these lines .",
    "since the ionized gas from which these lines arise is primarily located in hii regions , which have small angular extent relative to the rest of the galaxy ( and presumably the dust ) , and are usually distributed within a short height of the galaxy s midplane , this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "following from equation  ( [ eq : intensity ] ) and @xcite , we define the balmer optical depth as @xmath87 where @xmath88h@xmath89 and @xmath88h@xmath90 are the flux of the nebular emission lines located at 6562.8  and 4861.4   , respectively , and the value of 2.86 comes from the theoretical value expected for the unreddened ratio h@xmath91h@xmath2 undergoing case b recombination with @xmath92  k and @xmath93  @xmath94 @xcite . the superscript _",
    "l _ is used to emphasize that this quantity is coming from emission lines and should be distinguished from optical depths associated with the stellar continuum . if one assumes knowledge of the total - to - selective extinction , @xmath95 , then @xmath4 can be directly related to the color excess of the nebular gas , @xmath8 , through @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the total extinction at a given wavelength .",
    "if the extinction in other galaxies at these wavelengths were to be identical to the mw , which is unlikely to always be the case , then we can use @xmath98 @xcite .    since the hydrogen recombination lines are primarily produced within the hii regions of massive o and b stars",
    ", this implies that they are only sensitive to the attenuation of ionized gas around these massive stars . in general these same stars",
    "will also contribute greatly to the uv and optical light of the total stellar population , leading one to expect the reddening of the ionized gas to be related to the reddening seen in the stellar population ( traced by @xmath2 or @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , the distribution of these massive stars and the rest of the stellar population relative the distribution of dust , in addition to the age distribution of the stellar population ( i.e. , the relative contribution of older stars to the uv - optical flux density ) , will strongly influence how these quantities are related . for both starburst galaxies @xcite and star forming regions within local galaxies",
    "@xcite it appears that the stellar continuum suffers roughly one - half of the reddening of the ionized gas .",
    "this result suggests a scenario in which massive stars are more deeply embedded in molecular clouds than the long - lived stars ( e.g. , see descriptions in , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "another concern is that the total amount of dust within a galaxy may only weakly relate to attenuation , as the regions of lowest optical depth ( @xmath99 ) are providing the majority of the flux density @xcite .",
    "large amounts of the dust might exist in the regions of high optical depth ( @xmath100 ) , which would provide negligible amounts of flux density and thus not be represented by our tracers .",
    "fortunately , the presence of dust attenuation beyond the level of what can be measured in the optical has not been shown to be an issue for local starburst galaxies @xcite , and therefore we do not expect this to be a major concern .      for actively sfgs , where the uv is dominated by recent star formation ( i.e. , massive stars ) and there is little contamination from earlier generations of stars , the dust attenuation can also be measured from the uv flux density spectral slope , @xmath2 , which is defined as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the flux density in the range @xmath103   . for reference ,",

    "we do not observe large variations in the offset of @xmath2 with ssfr , as is seen in @xcite , but we note these studies probe different regimes , with the bin of highest ssfr ( @xmath133<-8.9 $ ] ) in our sample corresponding to the bin of lowest ssfr their sample ( @xmath133<-8.84 $ ] ) , which makes direct comparison difficult .",
    "we find that it is not particularly informative to divide the sample according to galaxy metallicity , mass , sfr , or @xmath134 because these show significant correlation with the attenuation parameters , which implies that these parameters segregate galaxies in @xmath2-@xmath4 parameter space . as a result , this makes it difficult to differentiate between variation in attenuation relations because low and high attenuation galaxies would be separated .",

    ", we add an additional constraint that @xmath137 in order to limit the stellar population age effects .",
    "we follow the same methodology presented in   [ attenuation curve ] , dividing each sample into 6 bins of @xmath4 and constructing average flux templates , to derive the attenuation curve for these subsamples .",
    "we do not consider bins with less than 100 galaxies in determination of the effective attenuation curve .",
    "for nearly all cases the effective attenuation curve in the uv ( derived from @xmath75 ) and optical ( derived from sdss spectra ) appear to be in agreement and well approximated by a single third - order polynomial .",
    "all of the fits to these subsamples are presented in table  [ tab : q_vs_param ] .",
    "we plot the subsample curves of @xmath138 alongside our average curve derived earlier and the @xcite curve ( left panels ) , as well as the curves normalized by @xmath139 and alongside the @xcite mw curve ( right panels ) , in figure  [ fig : q_compare_subsample ] .",
    "slight differences in @xmath138 appear in the @xmath131 and ssfr subsamples , with the latter case being more significant .",
    "if we make the crude assumption that these galaxies have similar extinction curves , then this would indicate variation in @xmath140 .",
    "these differences suggest that galaxies with lower @xmath131 or higher ssfr have slightly higher ratios of @xmath140 ( lower @xmath139 ) .",
    "these changes are quite interesting because they indicate differences in the relative reddening of the ionized gas and the stellar continuum .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that in galaxies with elevated sfrs the uv reddening is more heavily weighted towards the same regions that dominate the balmer line emission , thus increasing @xmath140 .",
    "one can imagine that for the extreme scenario in which nearly all of the global flux density is exclusively produced in hii regions , that this ratio would approach unity .",
    "however , this behavior is dependent on the optical depth of these star forming regions . in their study of @xmath14 sfgs ,",
    "@xcite find a lower ratio with increasing ssfr which they attribute to a larger fraction of the star formation in the galaxy becoming obscured in optically thick regions as the sfr increases .",
    "these obscured regions do not contribute significantly to the uv emission , but they continue to contribute to the balmer line emission .",
    "thus , the uv slope underestimates the dust attenuation relative to the balmer line inferred attenuation for these galaxies such that @xmath140 decreases toward larger sfrs .",
    "it is important to note that a lower ratio of @xmath140 is also possible if higher star formation activity gives rise to significant outflows which reduce the overall optical depth affecting the stellar continuum .",
    "it is also important to state again that the sample of @xcite probes a higher range of ssfr than this work and this may lead to differences in the underlying physical mechanisms at work between the two samples . given the complex dependence of this ratio , we can not make any clear statement as to the cause of the differences that we see in our sample .",
    "another notable result that can be seen in figure  [ fig : q_compare_subsample ] is that there is virtually no dependence on the behavior of the attenuation curve as a function of the redshift spanned by our sample .",
    "we take this to indicate that the different physical aperture scales being probed as a result of our choice of fixed angular aperture does not seem to significantly alter the resulting curve .",
    "this also indicates that the average attenuation properties over smaller galaxy regions do not significantly deviate from the total values .",
    "despite the changes seen in the behavior of @xmath138 with proxies for stellar age , after normalizing the curves as @xmath141 the difference in the curves is significantly reduced in all cases ( see right panels of figure  [ fig : q_compare_subsample ] ) .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite for their @xmath14 sample of galaxies separated by ssfr , albeit with a different overall shape than we find for local galaxies .",
    "this remarkable result indicates that despite the differences in physical properties and sfhs that are spanned by sfgs in the local universe , on average they appear to suffer from a _",
    "similar attenuation curve_. however , the large scatter in the @xmath2-@xmath4 relation and the flux density seds likely implies that there are variations in the attenuation on a case - by - case basis , part of which can stem from differences in the star - dust geometry .",

    "future large area ir surveys , such as those planned with _ euclid _ and the _ wide - field infrared survey telescope _ ( _ wfirst _ ) , will image vast numbers of galaxies .",
    "given the shortest wavelengths available to these missions , @xmath177    and @xmath178    for _ euclid _ and _ wfirst _ , respectively , the shortest rest - frame wavelengths available for galaxies with @xmath179 this will correspond to the optical portion of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , a proper utilization of the @xmath2-@xmath4 relation would require separate measurements from another facility to determine uv slope .",
    "here we investigate the possibility of using the optical slope , from the observed sdss @xmath58 ( @xmath180   ) and @xmath181 ( @xmath182   ) fiber photometry , as an indicator for reddening of the continuum instead of @xmath2 .",
    "this is calculated using the same method as for the uv slope , @xmath183}{\\log(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{u}}/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{g}})}\\,.\\ ] ] we expect that the correlation between the optical slope and @xmath4 to be weaker than the uv slope , given that this region is less sensitive to the effects of dust and more sensitive to older stellar populations .    in figure  [",
    "fig : ug_beta_tau ] we show the @xmath184 and @xmath4 values for our sample of 9813 sfgs .",
    "a linear fit to the data using the mpfitexy routine @xcite gives @xmath185 with an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath186 .",
    "as expected , this dispersion is larger than that found using the uv slope , but not by a very large amount .",
    "similar to earlier anaylsis , we divide the sample by @xmath131 to determine its role in the dispersion .",
    "we plot the sample divided into three ranges of @xmath131 in figure  [ fig : ug_beta_tau_subsample ] and the fitted relationships are @xmath187 @xmath188 @xmath189 it is evident that the dispersion is reduced by @xmath190 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath131 acts as an indicator of the intrinsic optical slope ( i.e. , the normalization of the @xmath191 relation ) . from this",
    "we believe that the optical slope might be viable for determining appropriate corrections in a large statistical sample , especially if information on the 4000  break is available to correct for stellar age effects ."
