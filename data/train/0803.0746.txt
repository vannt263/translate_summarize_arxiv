    "this means that many transits will very likely be recorded with extremely high photometric precision during the operational phase of kepler starting in 2009 .",
    "timing variations in the transits , if detected , could indicate the presence of other bodies in the system , such as terrestrial - mass planets or trojan satellites .",

    "the total number of frames taken from hat - p-7 was 514 with cadence of 28 seconds . during the reduction of the keplercam data",
    ", we used the following method .",
    "after bias and flat calibration of the images , an astrometric transformation ( in the form of first order polynomials ) between the @xmath51 brightest stars and the 2mass catalog was derived , as described in @xcite , yielding a residual of @xmath52 pixel .",

    "the instrumental magnitude transformation was obtained using @xmath53 stars on a frame taken near culmination of the field .",
    "the transformation fit was initially weighted by the estimated photon- and background - noise error of each star , then the procedure was repeated weighting by the inverse variance of the light curves . from the set of apertures we have chosen the aperture for which the out - of - transit ( oot ) rms of hat - p-7 was the smallest ;",
    "the radius of this aperture is 6 pixels .",
    "this light curve was then de - correlated against trends using the oot sections , which yielded a light curve with an overall rms of 1.9mmag at a cadence of one frame per 28 seconds .",
    "this is a bit larger than the expected rms of 1.5mmag , derived from the photon noise ( 1.2mmag ) and scintillation noise  which has an expected amplitude of 0.8mmag , based on the observational conditions and the calculations of @xcite  possibly due to unresolved trends and other noise sources .",

    "analysis of the hatnet data yielded an initial value for the orbital period and transit epoch .",
    "the initial period and epoch were used to fold the rv s , and phase them with respect to the predicted transit time for a circular orbit .",
    "the hatnet and the rv epochs together yield a more accurate period , since the time difference between the discovery light curve and the rv follow - up is fairly long ; more than 3 years . using this refined period",
    ", we can extrapolate to the expected center of the keplercam partial transit , and therefore obtain a fit for the two remaining key parameters describing the light curve : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the semi - major axis for a circular orbit , and the impact parameter @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the inclination of the orbit .",
    "second , using as starting points the initial values as derived above , we performed a joint fit of the hatnet , rv and fu data , i.e.  fitting _ all _ of the parameters simultaneously .",
    "the reason for such a joint fit is that the three separate data - sets and the fitted parameters are intertwined .",
    "for example , the epoch ( depending partly on the rv fit ) has a relatively large error , affecting the extrapolation of the transit center to the keplercam follow - up .    in all of the above procedures",
    ", we used the downhill simplex method to search for the best fit values and the method of refitting to synthetic data sets to find out the error of the adjusted parameters .",
    "the latter method yields a monte - carlo set of the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the fit parameters .",
    "the third step of the analysis was the derivation of the stellar parameters , based on the spectroscopic analysis of the host star ( high resolution spectroscopy using keck / hires ) , and the physical modeling of the stellar evolution , based on existing isochrone models .",
    "as the fourth step , we then combined the results of the joint fit and stellar parameter determination to determine the planetary and orbital parameters of the hat - p-7b system .",
    "finally , we have done a blend analysis to confirm that the orbiting companion is a hot jupiter . in the following subsections",
    "we give a detailed description of the above main steps of the analysis .",

    "although at this stage we were interested only in the epoch and period , we have used the transit light curve model with the assumption quadratic limb darkening , where the flux decrease was calculated using the models provided by @xcite . in principle , fitting the epoch and period as two independent variables is equivalent to fitting the time instant of the centers of the first and last observed individual transits , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , with a constraint that all intermediate transits are regularly spaced with period @xmath76 . note that this fit takes into account _",
    "all _ transits that occurred during the hatnet observations , even though it is described only by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the fit yielded @xmath77 ( bjd ) and @xmath78 ( bjd ) . the period derived from the @xmath74 and @xmath75 epochs was @xmath79  days . using these values",
    ", we found that there were 326 cycles between @xmath75 and the end of the rv campaign .",
    "the epoch extrapolated to the approximate time of rv measurements was @xmath80 ( bjd ) .",
    "note that the error in @xmath81 is much smaller than the period itself ( @xmath82days ) , so there is no ambiguity in the number of elapsed cycles when folding the periodic signal .",
    "we then analyzed the radial velocity data in the following way .",
    "we defined the @xmath83 transit as that being closest to the end of the radial velocity measurements .",
    "this means that the first transit observed by hatnet ( at @xmath74 ) was the @xmath84 event .",
    "given the short period , we assumed that the orbit has been circularized @xcite ( later verified ; see below ) .",
    "the orbital fit is linear if we choose the radial velocity zero - point @xmath85 and the amplitudes @xmath86 and @xmath87 as adjusted values , namely : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an arbitrary time instant ( chosen to be @xmath90 bjd ) , @xmath91 is the semi - amplitude of the rv variations , and @xmath76 is the initial period @xmath92 taken from the previous independent hatnet fit . the actual epoch can be derived from the above equation since for circular orbits transit center occurs when the rv curve has the most negative slope . using the equations above",
    ", we derived the initial epoch of the @xmath93 transit center to be @xmath94 ( bjd ) .",
    "we also performed a more general ( non - linear ) fit to the rv in which we let the eccentricity float .",
    "this fit yielded an eccentricity consistent with zero , namely @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , we adopt a circular orbit in the further analysis .    combining the rv epoch @xmath97 with the first epoch observed by hatnet ( @xmath74 )",
    ", we obtained a somewhat refined period , @xmath98  days .",
    "this was fed back into phasing the rv data , and we performed the rv fit again to the parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the fit yielded @xmath99@xmath100 , @xmath101@xmath100and @xmath102 ( bjd ) .",
    "this epoch was used to further refine the period to get @xmath103d , where the error calculation assumes that @xmath104 and @xmath105 are uncorrelated . at this point",
    "we stopped the above iterative procedure of refining the epoch and period ; instead a final refinement of epoch and period was obtained through performing a joint fit , ( as described later in ",
    "[ sec : jointfit ] ) .",
    "we note that in order to get a reduced chi - square value near unity for the radial velocity fit , it was necessary to quadratically increase the noise component with an amplitude of @xmath106  @xmath100 , which is well within the range of stellar jitter observed for late f stars ; see @xcite .    using the improved period @xmath107 and the epoch @xmath104",
    ", we extrapolated to the center of keplercam follow - up transit ( @xmath108 ) . since the follow - up observation only recorded a partial event ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc]d ) , this extrapolation was necessary to improve the light curve modeling .",
    "for this , we have used a quadratic limb - darkening approximation , based on the formalism of @xcite .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficients were based on the results of the sme analysis ( notably , @xmath109 ; see   [ sec : stellarparameters ] for further details ) , which yielded @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "the result of the fit was @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117day@xmath16 , where the uncertainty of the transit center time due to the relatively high error in the transit epoch @xmath104 was also taken into account in the error estimates .",
    "the results of the individual fits described above provide the starting values for a joint fit , i.e.  a simultaneous fit to all of the available hatnet , radial velocity and the partial follow - up light curve data .",
    "the adjusted parameters were @xmath105 , the time of first transit center in the hatnet campaign , @xmath118 , the out - of - transit magnitude of the hatnet light curve in @xmath119-band and the previously defined parameters of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath120 , @xmath113 and @xmath121 .",
    "we note that in this joint fit _ all _ of the transits in the hatnet light curve have been adjusted simultaneously , tied together by the constraint of assuming a strictly periodic signal ; the shape of all these transits were characterized by @xmath120 , @xmath113 and @xmath121 ( and the limb - darkening coefficients ) while the distinct transit center time instants were interpolated using @xmath122 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 via the rv fit . for initial values we used the results of the independent fits ( ) .",

    "we have also tested the significance of the correlation between the radial velocity and the bisector variations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the velocity variations are real and that the star is orbited by a jovian planet .",
    "we note here that the mean bisector span ratio relative to the radial velocity amplitude is the smallest ( @xmath235 ) among all the hatnet planets , indicating an exceptionally high confidence that the rv signal is not due to a blend with an eclipsing binary companion .",
    "with orbital period of only 2.2 days , implying a semi - major axis of only @xmath19au , hat - p-7b , is a `` very hot jupiter '' , a name frequently given to giant planets with orbital period less than 3 days ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , what really matters is the incident flux from the parent star , which for hat - p-7b is exceptionally high because ( a ) the large radius of the parent star ( @xmath236@xmath11 ) combined with the small semi - major axis yields a very small geometrical factor @xmath237 ( whose inverse describes the stellar flux impinging on the planet ) ; and ( b ) its parent star has relatively high effective temperature : @xmath20k .",
    "the flux impinging on the planet is @xmath238 erg @xmath15s@xmath16 .",
    "this places it among the most highly irradiated members of the `` pm '' class of planets , as discussed by @xcite .    for a pm class planet ,",
    "@xcite argue that the incident radiation is absorbed by tio and vo molecules in a hot stratosphere , and almost immediately re - radiated , rather than being partially advected to the night side of the planet , as would be the case if the radiation were absorbed deeper down in the cooler atmosphere of a `` pl '' planet , which would not have gaseous tio and vo in its atmosphere .    for a pm planet",
    ", the dayside temperature would be given by @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the bond albedo , which we assume to be essentially zero ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the redistribution factor @xmath241 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for hat - p-7",
    "this yields a dayside temperature of @xmath17k .",
    "if at the other extreme , contrary to the theory of @xcite , the incident energy absorbed by hat - p-7b were to be distributed isotropically over the planet s surface before being re - emitted , as is predicted for `` pl '' planets too cool to have significant tio and vo in their atmospheres , then @xmath242 in equation 3 , and the day - side temperature would be @xmath243k .",
    "thus , detection and measurement of the emission from the dayside of hat - p-7b would yield an important test of the theory of @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted that the thermal emission in the optical and near infrared from very hot jupiters should be detectable from the ground .",
    "@xcite identified ogle - tr-56b , the only other known very hot jupiter with predicted dayside temperature as high as that of hat - p-7b , as a particularly promising candidates . however , since hat - p-7 is 6 magnitudes brighter than ogle - tr-56 , it is a far better candidate for secondary eclipse studies from the ground . for hat - p-7 ,",
    "the brightness decrease in @xmath244-band at secondary eclipse should be @xmath245 or @xmath246 in the respective cases of zero ( pm - type ) or complete ( pl - type ) planet - wide re - distribution of irradiated stellar flux .",
    "this implies that in the former case the eclipse could be detected at the 2-sigma level with a 1.2-m telescope with a @xmath244-band integration of 4 hours during eclipse ( that is , the total eclipse duration ) , plus 4 more hours of out - of - eclipse observation .",
    "we plan to carry out such observations in the near future with the keplercam on and with mmt  6.5  m ( also at flwo ) telescopes .",
    "recently @xcite reported the discovery of the transiting exoplanet wasp-3b , located 0.0317 au from an f star with @xmath20k and radius @xmath247 ; this indicates a very high radiative flux at the planet of @xmath248 erg @xmath15s@xmath16 , comparable to but about 25% smaller than the radiative flux at hat - p-7b .",
    "for the same reasons as for the case of hat - p-7b discussed above , this almost certainly will be a pm - class planet , so that its dayside temperature should be about 2530k , as indicated by equation 3 with @xmath241 and @xmath249 .",
    "this planet should also be detectable in visible or near infrared radiation .",
    "in fact , if it is a pm planet , the depth of secondary eclipse as seen in @xmath244-band should be similar to that for hat - p-7b , namely @xmath245 : although with its lower dayside temperature the surface brightness of wasp-3b should be smaller than for hat - p-7b , the geometrical factor @xmath250 is larger , because wasp-3 is a less evolved star .",
    "hat - p-7b has an additional important property in that it is in the field of view of one of the detectors on the forthcoming kepler mission @xcite , currently scheduled for launch in early 2009 to monitor stars for photometric signals from transiting planets and other forms of stellar variability .",
    "hence , hat - p-7 should be subjected to intense and regular photometric observations for several years starting in 2009 .",
    "this will permit extremely high precision light curves of the primary transit , the secondary transit , and perhaps also the variation of thermal and reflected light emission from the planet over the course of its orbit as described above .",
    "in addition , it will be possible to search intensively for transit timing variations over the several year lifetime of the mission .",
    "such observations could yield important information about orbital variations due to other companions in the system including terrestrial - mass or smaller planets or trojans , or to other effects such as precession of the orbital plane or the orbital line of nodes . to maximize the scientific return from kepler in this regard",
    ", it would be very useful to obtain high precision light curves both from the ground , and from space instruments such as epoxi and most , in the very near term for later comparison with kepler observations .",
    "asteroseismology of hat - p-7 using kepler could yield an independent measurement of the star s mean density from the `` large separation '' @xmath251 between p - modes of the same low angular degree @xmath252 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this would provide a check on the mean density of the star completely independent of that derived from the transit measurements of the @xmath54 parameter .",
    "equivalently , the asteroseismology measurements would yield an independent measurement of the stellar radius , and hence a more precise value for the radius of the planet hat - p-7b .",
    "such a rich combined data set could have additional benefits for understanding stellar structure and evolution .",
