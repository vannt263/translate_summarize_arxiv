    "light sterile neutrinos were invoked to explain the results of the lsnd experiment which reported oscillation events in the @xmath8 mode corresponding to a mass squared difference @xmath6 ev@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "adding one sterile neutrino to the standard 3 generation framework gives rise to two possible mass spectra  the 2 + 2 in which two pairs of mass states are separated by a difference @xmath6 ev@xmath9 and 3 + 1 in which a single predominantly sterile state differs by @xmath6 ev@xmath9 from the three active states @xcite .",
    "subsequently the 2 + 2 schemes were found to be incompatible with the solar and atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the miniboone experiment was designed to test this and its antineutrino data confirmed the lsnd anomaly @xcite .",
    "both 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 sterile neutrino schemes have been considered to explain these results @xcite .",
    "such global fits aim to explain the non - observance of ev@xmath9 oscillations in the disappearance channel in other short baseline experiments as well as the reported evidence in lsnd / miniboone experiments .",
    "the relevant probabilities for 3 + 1 case is governed by a single mass squared difference and hence is independent of the cp phase . in the 3 + 2 scheme ,",
    "dependence on cp phase comes into play and one gets a slightly better fit .",
    "other evidences in support of sterile neutrinos include  the reactor and the ga anomaly .",
    "the first one refers to the deficit in the measured electron antineutrino flux in several experiments when the theoretical predictions of reactor neutrino fluxes were reevaluated @xcite .",
    "the second one implies shortfall of electron neutrinos observed in the solar neutrino detectors gallex and sage using radioactive sources @xcite . both these can be explained by adding light sub - ev sterile neutrinos in the three generation framework .",
    "there has also been some hint in favour of sterile neutrinos from cosmological observations of a `` dark radiation '' which is weakly interacting and relativistic . attributing this to sterile neutrinos one gets the bound on the number of neutrinos as @xmath10 at 68% c.l @xcite .",
    "the plank satellite experiment which has very recently declared its first results @xcite , on the other hand , gives @xmath11 at 68% c.l . which allows for an extra sterile neutrino at 95% c.l .",
    ", although its mixing with active species can be very tightly constrained @xcite within the framework of standard cosmology .",
    "thus the sterile neutrinos continue to be intriguing and many new experiments are planned proposed to test this @xcite .    theoretically , sterile neutrinos are naturally included in type - i seesaw model @xcite .",
    "but their mass scale is usually very high to account for the small mass of the neutrinos .",
    "light sub - ev sterile neutrinos as suggested by the data can arise in many models @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the mechanism for generation of neutrino masses the low energy majorana mass matrix in presence of an extra sterile neutrino will be of dimension @xmath12 with ten independent entries and is given as , @xmath13 where , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes the leptonic mixing matrix in a basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "one of the important aspects in the study of neutrino physics is to explore the structure of the neutrino mass matrices . at the fundamental level",
    "these are governed by yukawa couplings which are essentially free parameters in most models .",
    "these motivated the study of texture zeros which means one or more elements are relatively small compared to the others .",
    "texture zeros in the low energy mass matrices in the context of three generations have been extensively explored both in the quark and lepton sector @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such studies help in understanding the underlying parameter space and the nature of the mass spectrum involved and often predict correlations between various parameters which can be experimentally tested . for three generation scenario",
    "it is well known that the number of maximum texture zeros in low energy mass matrix is two @xcite . in the context of the 4-neutrino case however more",
    "than two zeros can be allowed @xcite .",
    "two zero textures of sterile neutrinos have been studied recently in @xcite and three zero cases have been considered in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the textures where one of the mass matrix elements is vanishing . for the @xmath12 symmetric mass matrix it gives total 10 different cases which needs to be investigated .",
    "we study the implications of one zero textures and the possible correlations between the parameters .",
    "we also compare our results with the 1 zero textures for three active neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper goes as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the possible mass spectra and the mixing matrix in the 3 + 1 scenario . in the next section we present our study regarding the implications of one vanishing entry in the low energy neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "there are two ways in which one can add a predominantly sterile state separated by @xmath6 ev@xmath9 from the standard 3 neutrino mass states . in the first case the additional neutrino can be of higher mass than the other three while in the second case the the fourth neutrino is the lightest state .",
    "the later turns out to be incompatible with cosmology since in this case three active neutrinos , each with mass @xmath6 ev results in an enhanced cosmological energy density .",
    "thus it suffices to consider only the first case which admits two possibilities displayed in fig . 1 .
