    "all the known fundamental physical interactions can be formulated in a common framework : as _ local gauge theories_. this is true especially of gravity ; however einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , when viewed as a theory for a dynamic spacetime metric , does not so well reveal its affinity with other gauge theories .",
    "( for a recent discussion of the fundamental gauge theory nature of gravity , see ref .",
    "physically ( and geometrically ) it is reasonable to consider gravity as a gauge theory of the local poincar symmetry of minkowski spacetime .",
    "a formulation of gravity based on local spacetime geometry gauge symmetry , the quadratic poincar gauge theory of gravity ( pg , a.k.a .  pgt ) was worked out some time ago  @xcite , and now there is a comprehensive reader with reprints and comments  @xcite .",
    "the pg is formulated in terms of riemann - cartan spacetime geometry , having a metric and a metric compatible connection .",
    "such a connection has , in general , both curvature and torsion .",
    "independent of the metric , the connection has six possible dynamic connection modes ; they carry spin-@xmath0 , spin-@xmath1 , spin-@xmath2 .",
    "a good dynamic mode should transport positive energy and should not propagate outside the forward null cone .",
    "investigations ( especially refs .",
    "@xcite ) of the linearized ( even parity ) quadratic pg theory found that at most three modes can be simultaneously dynamic ; all the acceptable cases were tabulated ; many combinations of three modes are satisfactory to linear order . complementing this ,",
    "the hamiltonian analysis revealed the related constraints  @xcite .",
    "then detailed investigations of the hamiltonian and propagation  @xcite concluded that effects due to nonlinearities in the constraints could be expected to render all of these cases physically unacceptable except for the two `` scalar modes '' , carrying spin-@xmath3 and spin-@xmath4 .    in order to further investigate the dynamical possibilities of these pg scalar modes ,",
    "friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological models were considered . using a @xmath5 model",
    "it was found that the @xmath3 mode naturally couples to the acceleration of the universe and could account for the present day observations  @xcite ; this model was then extended to include the @xmath4 mode  @xcite .",
    "there is no known fundamental reason why the gravitational coupling should respect parity .",
    "odd parity terms with pseudoscalar parameters were first introduced into the quadratic pg some time ago  @xcite , but this innovation was not followed up until more recent times .",
    "now there is renewed interest in all the possible couplings between even and odd parity modes .",
    "the odd parity terms with their pseudoscalar coupling parameters were rediscovered and included in the pg  @xcite .",
    "after systematically developing the general parity pg theory , in bhn  @xcite the two scalar torsion mode pg lagrangian was extended to include the appropriate pseudoscalar coupling constants that provide cross parity coupling ( often referred to as `` parity violating '' terms ) and the flrw cosmological models were formulated .",
    "the bhn cosmologies were then further explored  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the pg bhn model was expected to be clearly revealed in purely time dependent solutions , hence _",
    "homogeneous cosmologies _ were investigated .",
    "the two dynamical connection modes carry spin 0@xmath6 and spin 0@xmath7 ( referred to as _ scalar _ modes or , more specifically , as the _ scalar _ and _ pseudoscalar _ mode ) . consequently in a homogeneous situation",
    "they can not pick out any spatial direction , and thus they have no interaction with spatial anisotropy , so for a study of their dynamics it is most simple and appropriate to look to _ isotropic _ models .",
    "for the pg bhn model , following the technique used in  @xcite , an effective lagrangian and hamiltonian as well as a system of first order dynamical equations for bianchi class a isotropic homogeneous cosmological models was constructed , and some sample evolution was presented which showed the effect of the cross parity coupling .",
    "the normal modes were identified , and it was shown analytically how they control the late time asymptotics .",
    "a numerical evolution example was presented which shows that the asymptotic late time normal mode evolution is a good approximation  @xcite .",
    "recently karananas took on the major task of analyzing the modes in the general quadratic pg including all the odd parity terms in the lagrangian .",
    "at first it seemed that the general pg theory ( including all the scalar and pseudoscalar parameters ) would allow for all the possible connection modes to have _ good _",
    "( i.e. , `` no ghosts , no tachyons '' ) propagation .",
    "however , more careful checking showed that this is not possible after all  @xcite , nevertheless it does seem that the healthy parameter space of the theory is extended by the inclusion of the odd parity terms . in view of this",
    "it is timely to reconsider cosmology for the general quadratic pg , with no _ a priori _ restrictions on the parameters .",
    "we would like to note that the pg theory is a viable alternative to gr . while there are no observations that confirm non - vanishing torsion , there are no observations that exclude torsion , only some mild constraints on the magnitude . for",
    "a detailed discussion and a recent assessment of the observational status of torsion the reader may consult ni  @xcite .",
    "briefly , we just mention that torsion naturally couples to spin , to directly detect it may require highly spin polarized materials . on the other hand it may be that torsion could play a significant role on the cosmological scale .    since the 1970s cosmological models for the einstein - cartan ( ec ) theory and the poincar gauge theory of gravity ( pg )",
    "have been developed .",
    "for the ec theory see , e.g. , kopczynki  @xcite , trautman  @xcite , tafel  @xcite , and kuchowicz  @xcite .",
    "the special interest then was the possibility that models with torsion could avoid singularities , however it was soon noted that torsion is likely to make singularities more severe rather than prevent them , see , e.g. , kerlick  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "et al_.  @xcite developed torsion cosmology in a series of papers .",
    "for the early work on pg cosmology see  goenner and mller - hoissen  @xcite .",
    "a more recent report on the status of the subject was given by puetzfeld  @xcite , which surveyed virtually all of the papers on the subject up to 2004 ; as far as we know it only overlooked  @xcite .",
    "for the recent work by our group see  @xcite . for other recent works see  @xcite .",
    "the objective of this present work is to begin the analysis of the _ general quadratic pg cosmology_. specifically we consider homogeneous isotropic cosmologies , using an isotropic bianchi representation to obtain a manifestly homogeneous formulation .",
    "this allows us to obtain the dynamical equations via an effective lagrangian .",
    "we find a set of 6 first order equations and discuss the behavior of generic solutions showing some typical numerical evolution .",
    "the poincar gauge theory of gravity ( pg )  @xcite is based on spacetime with a riemann - cartan geometry , i.e. , a lorentz signature metric with a metric compatible connection .",

    "@xmath20 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the associated field equations for the coframe and connection are obtained by varying with respect to these potentials .",
    "this gives dynamical equations for the potentials of the quasi - linear second order type with the respective material sources ( obtained from some @xmath21 , a minimally coupled matter lagrangian ) being the energy - momentum , @xmath22 , and the spin density @xmath23 3-forms .",
    "the dynamical equations have the general form @xmath24 from these two equations , with the aid of the bianchi identities  ( [ bianchiid ] ) ( and also via a noether theorem type argument ) one can obtain the conservation of energy - momentum and angular momentum expressions .    in complete detail",
    "the general quadratic pg lagrangian 4-form is  @xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the scalar curvature and @xmath27 is the pseudoscalar curvature ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the torsion has been decomposed into three algebraically irreducible pieces : @xmath29 , which are , respectively , a pure tensor ( 16 components ) , the trace ( vector ) , and a totally antisymmetric part ( dual to an axial vector ) .",
    "similarly the curvature 2-form has been decomposed into a sum of 6 algebraically irreducible pieces : @xmath30 , namely , in numerical order : weyl , pair - commutator , pseudoscalar , ricci - symmetric , ricci - antisymmetric , and scalar .",
    "the respective number of components is ( 10,9,1,9,6,1 ) . in the above lagrangian the parameters @xmath31 ( which multiply even parity 4-forms ) are scalars , and the parameters @xmath32 ( which multiply odd parity 4-forms ) are pseudoscalars .",
    "the general theory has 11 scalar plus 7 pseudoscalar parameters .",
    "but they are not all physically independent .",

    "the decision is simply a practical question , not a fundamental issue : one could select the most convenient choice for a particular application , although this complicates the comparison of results obtained via different choices .",

    "these `` new '' terms exclude a special class of solutions with certain constant values for the scalar curvatures @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath112 vanishes we are back at the bhn case investigated earlier  @xcite .",
    "that model , with one further parameter restriction , admits a certain class of constant curvature solutions  @xcite .    it should be noted that we have written our equations in a form in which they are valid for all ranges of the parameters , including both the `` physical '' and `` unphysical '' ranges , as well as degenerate cases .",
    "generically there are 3 degrees of freedom , but in certain degenerate cases there are less , such as when @xmath128 vanishes or when the matrix  ( [ kinetict ] ) has less than maximal rank",
    ". then some of the above equations change their character .",
    "they may become constraint equations rather than dynamical equations .",
    "a particularly interesting subclass is the generalized einstein - cartan system , wherein all the quadratic curvature parameters vanish ; this includes gr as a special case .",
    "an analysis of that subclass is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . from here on we confine our attention the _ generic _ case , with no special degeneracies .",
    "the fluid pressure @xmath69 , the cosmological constant @xmath20 , and the spatial curvature parameter @xmath129 play essentially the same roles here in the gqpg as they play in the gr flrw cosmologies . hence , in order to better see the novel features of gqpg cosmology , we take them to vanish in our further considerations .    following the procedure used in  @xcite , _ for vanishing @xmath20 and @xmath129 _ , by dropping higher than linear order terms in @xmath130 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 in the dynamical equations",
    ", our model can be linearized .",
    "( it should be noted that under these assumptions @xmath68 and hence @xmath69 are non - linear . )",
    "this leads to the first order _",
    "linearized _ versions of the dynamical equations .    using this procedure for the bhn model one zero frequency and two dynamical normal modes were identified .",
    "furthermore , it was argued that the dynamical variables would have a fall off of @xmath131 . hence the dynamical variables rescaled by @xmath132 would at late time just approach the linearized modes .",
    "this behavior was confirmed by numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the gqpg equations considered here with those of the bhn model considered in  @xcite shows that the new terms that appear in the general system , those with the coefficient @xmath112 , are all _ non - linear_. hence the _ linearization _ of the gqpg is essentially identical with that of the bhn model , and thus the gqpg cosmology has essentially the same linearized normal modes and frequencies as were found earlier for the bhn model .",
    "consequently the `` late time '' normal mode analysis for the @xmath133 case ( as discussed in  @xcite ) applies to general quadratic pg cosmology virtually unchanged . that the gqpg really does show essentially these same qualities has been demonstrated in our numerical analysis described in the next section .",
    "we note that the zero frequency mode for the gqpg is @xmath134 ( from eqs .",
    "( [ dotrdotx])([udotrho3p ] ) it can be verified that this is indeed constant to linear order ) while the details of the normal modes and frequencies are , as mentioned , essentially identical with those presented in  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]",
    "here we have considered flrw cosmological models for the general quadratic pg , including all the possible even and odd parity terms with their respective scalar and pseudoscalar parameters . for",
    "the general pg all six connection modes are in principle dynamic  however the cosmological symmetries essentially only allow _ scalar _ dynamic connection modes .",
    "generically the general quadratic pg cosmology has , in addition to the usual metric scale factor , just two dynamical connection modes with spin-@xmath135 : @xmath3 and @xmath136 , effectively a scalar and a pseudoscalar .",
    "in addition to the two of gr ( @xmath137 ) , the gqpg flrw cosmology has 8 more physical parameters ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "we used a manifestly homogeneous and isotropic bianchi representation to develop an effective lagrangian , an energy expression , and the 2nd order dynamical equations for the 3 gauge potentials .",
    "an equivalent first order system of 6 equations for the observables was obtained .",
    "certain inequalities were noted that identify a preferred physical range of parameters .",
    "the late time dynamical behavior for generic solutions within the physical parameter range was discussed and illustrated using numerical evolution .",
    "it turns out that the gqpg has effectively just one more free parameter ( @xmath112 ) beyond what the earlier works  @xcite considered ; typical dynamical effects of this parameter were discussed and illustrated via numerical evolution .    the two dynamic connection modes do not directly couple to any known matter .",
    "hence they could be relatively large and unnoticed . the @xmath3 scalar mode couples directly to the hubble expansion rate .",
    "torsion could play a role in the observable universe .",
