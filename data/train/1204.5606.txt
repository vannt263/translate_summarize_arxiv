    "telegraph signals have been observed in experiments of very different nature .",
    "they are displayed as sudden changes of a measured signal between two or more values with time , appearing in a random , statistical manner ( cf . for instance @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "+ the common theoretical approaches to random telegraph signals involve stochastic elements and range from hidden markov models , to marcus theory and classical or quantum stochastic approaches @xcite ( more details are found in ref .",
    "the bohr - born concept of state reduction @xcite is implied by the state - of - the - art decoherence theory where permanent  measurement  by the environment of a local system is assumed to lead to special pointer states , into which the system collapses . within collapse theories the explanation of the statistical change of the state of a measured local system relies on truncation of the coherent time development , as it is described with the time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "between two collapses the local system evolves coherently , at random time intervals it collapses on one or another eigenstate of the  measuring  environment .",
    "there is no approach , to our knowledge , based on a pure coherent time development as schrdinger s equation requires , leading to a coherent telegraph - signal - like behaviour of a quantum system .",
    "+ the question is : can a coherent quantum mechanical description of a local system in interaction with the environment lead to the telegraph signal . in the present paper",
    "we give a positive answer to this question .",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible for a system , comprising a local part , entangled to the continua of the environmental excitations , to change state suddenly in an apparently statistical fashion , which comes out of the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the conditions for a telegraph - signal - like change of state of the system are weak and local coupling to a continuum of environmental excitations exhibiting soft modes .",
    "the time development is coherent and deterministic in the phase space of the total system including the environmental excitations .",
    "focusing on the time development of the local system alone , which is assumed to be accessible to measurement in experiment , it appears as if it changes state in a random way .    in the next section",
    "we define the model and the hamiltonian . next the method of solution",
    "is outlined , followed by presenting the results and their discussion .",
    "the model describes an object called which moves in a universe consisting of two sides , side @xmath0 and side @xmath1 .",
    "we want to investigate how long does it take for the to get from one side to the other , i.e. the dynamics of side change . in the present article",
    "we specify neither the nor the physical nature of the environmental excitations .",
    " particles  like an electron or an adsorbed atom and the environmental continua of electron - hole pairs , phonons , etc . may be envisioned .",
