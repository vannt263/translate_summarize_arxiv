    "on the basis of the temperature dependence of its macroscopic properties , liquid water belongs to a class of liquids often referred to as `` associated liquids . ''",
    "[ fig : internal_pressure ] gives one example of a characteristic distinction between liquid water and common organic solvents : the temperature dependence of the internal pressure . for van der waals liquids , this temperature dependence is related directly to the temperature dependence of the liquid density .",
    "organic solvents conform to this expectation , but liquid water exhibits a contrasting behavior , and that alternative behavior is attributed typically to the temperature dependence of water association through hydrogen bonding interactions .    .",
    "organic solvents conform to this expectation , but water is qualitatively different.[fig : internal_pressure],width=307 ]    as an associated liquid , water is regarded broadly also as a network liquid , though a definition of `` network liquid '' is usually not attempted .",
    "one aspect of the network view of liquid water is that models with defined short - ranged hydrogen bonding interactions that vanish precisely outside a finite range are designed specifically to study the network characteristics of that fluid .",
    "the work of peery & evans@xcite gives a recent example that reviews and advances the forefront of statistical mechanical theory built explicitly on that network concept ; this line of inquiry does indeed have an extended history , and the citations @xcite give further examples .",
    "the finite range of interactions is a common feature of lattice - gas models of liquid water.@xcite    the theory investigated here is motivated by a simple , surprising result which can be regarded as a theorem for models with intermolecular interactions that vanish outside a radius @xmath0 , whether or not the liquid under consideration would be regarded as a network liquid on some other basis . specifically , it is that the excess chemical potential is precisely @xmath1 this excess chemical potential @xmath2 is the gibbs free energy per mole , in excess of the ideal contribution at the same density and temperature , of the one - component fluid considered .",
    "the thermodynamic temperature is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath5 is the excess chemical potential for a hard - sphere solute , with @xmath0 the distance of closest approach , at infinite dilution in the fluid . in the final term , @xmath6 is the probability that a specific actual molecule in the fluid has zero ( 0 ) neighbors within the radius @xmath0 .",
    "after articulation , the theorem eq .",
    "[ eq : theorem ] is straightforwardly understood , and a simple proof is given below . as an orienting comment , we note that eq .",
    "[ eq : theorem ] has been useful already in the theory of the hard - sphere fluid.@xcite of course , hard - sphere interactions are not involved literally in the interactions of physical systems , and it will transpire below that the hard - sphere contribution in eq .  [",

    "[ eq : theorem ] is correct if intermolecular interactions vanish beyond the radius @xmath0 , independently of whether the liquid under consideration is a network liquid .",

    "[ eq : theorem ] to real liquids , an extension which is realizable , and which is conceived on the basis of observable data , not from consideration of an assumed interaction model .",
    "the specific issues we address quantitatively include whether the effects of longer - than - near - neighbor interactions are simple for realistic models of liquid water , and whether reasonable values of @xmath0 can be found that make the statistical theory of liquid water particularly simple with realistic intermolecular interactions .",
    "we seek @xmath2 on the basis of accessible simulation data . since eq .",
    "[ eq : theorem ] contains @xmath5 , we consider evaluating that quantity on the basis of simulation of the realistically modeled liquid of interest . for that purpose ,",

    "@xmath10 is the marginal probability of that event .",
    "if the intermolecular interactions vanish for ranges as large as @xmath0 , those binding energies are always zero ( 0 ) .",

    "after regularization , the statistical problem becomes merely difficult . for @xmath13 , a gaussian distribution model for @xmath14",
    "should be accurate since then many solution elements will make small , weakly - correlated contributions to @xmath15 .",
    "the marginal probability @xmath10 becomes increasingly difficult to evaluate as @xmath0 becomes large , however . for @xmath0 on the order of molecular length scales typical of dense liquids , a simple gaussian model would accept some approximation error as the price for manageable statistical error .",
    "if @xmath16 is modeled by a gaussian of mean @xmath17 and variance @xmath18 , then @xmath19 we regard the formulation eq .",
    "[ eq : working_eq_gaussian ] merely as a parsimonious use of statistical information that might be obtained from a simulation record .",

    "[ eq : derivation ] and [ eq : thermoqct ] then suggests the identification @xmath22 thus the marginal probability of the event ( @xmath23 = 0 ) directly interrogates chemical contributions involving the chemical equilibrium ratios @xmath24 s on the basis of the assumed forcefield .",
    "this correspondence is indeed a basic result of constructive derivations of quasi - chemical theory.@xcite given adequate simulation data , explicit evaluation of individual @xmath24 s is not required . but more basic chemical analysis of the @xmath24 s , _ e.g. , _ using electronic structure method,@xcite is not implemented either .",
    "we add for completeness that previous discussions denoted @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the probability that the distinguished molecule has a coordination number of @xmath27 , and @xmath281.@xcite    these equations correctly suggest that this formulation is fully general for the classical statistical thermodynamic problem considered .",
    "this formulation does nt make a lattice structural idealization , does nt assume that the interaction potential energy is pairwise decomposable , does nt assume that the interaction potential energy model provides a handy definition of ` h - bonded , ' and the coordination definition  the occupancy within a radius @xmath0  is observational on the basis of molecular structure .",
    "effective values of @xmath0 should be established eventually on the basis of the statistical information secured .    of course , the chemical potential provides the partial molar entropy @xmath29 or for the one - component system considered here @xmath30 on the right side the quantities @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( the fluid pressure ) are mechanical properties which are directly available from a simulation record .",
    "it is an important but a tangential point that the distributions @xmath14 to which this theory directs our attention are different from the @xmath33 that have been frequently considered following the work of rahman & stillinger;@xcite see also the review of stillinger.@xcite @xmath33 is the distribution with the interpretation that @xmath34 is the _ number _ of molecules neighboring a particular one with pair interaction @xmath35 in the range @xmath36 .",

    "to test these ideas , 50000 snapshots from simulations@xcite performed at 298 , 350 and 400 k were analyzed .",

    "nevertheless , because of the exponential weighting of the integrand of eq .   and the large variances , the high-@xmath15 side of the distributions is overwhelmingly the more significant in this free energy prediction",
    ".    the fluctuation contribution exhibits a broad maximum for @xmath45 0.29  nm , after which this contribution decreases steadily with increasing @xmath0 [ table  [ tab : results ] ] .",

    "i.e. , _ those closer than the principal maximum of oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function , do nt contribute importantly to the fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with a quasi - chemical picture in which a water molecule and its nearest neighbors have a definite structural integrity .",
    "[ fig : xn ] shows @xmath26 ; the most probable coordination number is either 2 or 3 when @xmath0=0.30  nm , but it is 4 when @xmath0=0.33  nm",

    "@xmath27=4 and @xmath27=5 are nearly equally probable at @xmath47=298  k , and @xmath48 is then 17% of the whole . with the tip3p model ,",
    "as @xmath47 is lowered from 400  k to 298  k there is a clear tendency to enhance probability of higher coordination number cases.[fig : xn ] , width=307 ]    the magnitude of the individual contributions to @xmath2 are of the same order as the net free energy ; the mean binding energies are larger than that , as are the variance contributions in some cases .",
    "the variance contributions are about half as large as the mean binding energies , with opposite sign .",
    "it is remarkable and significant , therefore , that the net free energies at all temperatures are within roughly 12% of the numerically exact value computed by the histogram - overlap method .",
    "the predicted excess entropy , @xmath49 , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : murdep ] ) is in error by 17% at the lowest temperature considered and more accurate than that at the higher temperatures .",
    "the constant - pressure heat capacity predicted by the model is roughly 30% larger than the result obtained using the numerically exact values for @xmath49 in the same finite - difference estimate .",
    "a mean - field - like approximation that neglects fluctuations produces useless results .",
    "the consistent combination of the various terms is an important observation .",
    "for example , the packing contribution , @xmath50 , is sensitive to the interaction potential energy model used , and primarily through differences in the densities of different models at the higher temperatures.@xcite we found that use of values of @xmath50 corresponding to a more accurate model of liquid water @xcite spoils its consistency with the other contributions evaluated here with the tip3p model , and that appreciably degrades the accuracy of the whole .",

    ", the sum @xmath53 can not be identified as a hard - sphere contribution .",
    "since these terms have opposite signs , the net value can be zero or negative , and those possibilities are realized in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "to define the hard - sphere contribution more generally , we require that @xmath52 be continuous as @xmath54 1 with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "all other terms of eq .   will be independent of @xmath0 for values smaller than that , and it is natural to require that of @xmath52 also .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : murdep ] , we see that @xmath55 0.30  nm identifies a larger - size regime where the variation of the free energy with @xmath0 is not statistically significant .",
    "although we anticipate a decay toward the numerically exact value for @xmath56 , the statistical errors become unmanageable for values of @xmath0 much larger than 0.30  nm .",
    "when @xmath0 = 0.30  nm a significant skew in @xmath57 is not observed , as already noted with fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_rcut_full_t300 ] .",
    "the predicted free energy @xmath2 is then distinctly above the numerically exact value , suggesting that the gaussian model predicts too much weight in the high-@xmath15 tail .",
    "we further examined the high-@xmath15 tail of @xmath16 for larger values of @xmath0 by carrying - out monte carlo calculations under the same conditions but with one water molecule carrying an o - centered sphere that prohibits other o - atoms within a radius @xmath0 .",
    "those results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pe ] . the accuracy of a gaussian model @xmath16 is clearly born - out , but the gaussian model predicts slightly too much probability in the extreme high-@xmath15 region particularly for @xmath0 = 0.33  nm . the radial distribution of outer - shell neighbors in the conditioned sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grlambda ] ) shows that in that case the mean water - molecule - density is structured as a thin radial shell with roughly @xmath58 15 near - neighbors .",

    "( upper panel ) @xmath0 = 0.30  nm ; ( lower panel ) @xmath0 = 0.33  nm .",
    "the larger composite dots were obtained directly from molecular dynamics simulations with no constraint .",
    "the solid curve is the gaussian model for the expanded monte carlo data set , and confirms both the overall accuracy of the gaussian model and the estimated conditional mean and variance of table i. note that the data are slightly less than the gaussian model in the high-@xmath15 tail .",
    "@xmath47=298k.[fig : pe ] , width=307 ]    the design strategy here is that the theory should be correct in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "the accuracy of this approximate theory should then be judged for the largest values of @xmath0 that are practical .",
    "consulting the direct investigation of the high-@xmath15 tail ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pe ] ) , we see that the probability density drops off by roughly @xmath59 from the mode to the highest-@xmath15 data there .",

    "it has been argued that the cut - off parameter @xmath0 may be determined on a variational basis . inner- and outer - shell contributions have countervailing effects , so",
    "where the net - results are insensitive to local changes of @xmath0 distinct approximations may be considered well balanced.@xcite here , the contributions corresponding to the inner - shell contribution in quasi - chemical theory are obtained numerically exactly so that argument is nt compelling .",

    "that previous effort addressed a much more complicated case .",
    "several contributions had to be estimated on the basis of slightly extraneous input , _",
    "e.g. , _ dielectric model calculations and rough estimates of the effects of outer - shell dispersion contributions .",
    "nevertheless , there was some commonality in that both mean - field and fluctuation ( dielectric ) effects were involved in the outer - shell contributions .",

    "if these longer - ranged contributions were modeled as a mean - field contribution @xmath65 only , the error would be nearly 100% .",
    "on the basis of the present work , it is evident that ref .",
    "35 , in adopting the value @xmath0 = 0.28  nm for @xmath66 , assumed that quantitative chemical contributions reflecting short - ranged local order were negligible , independently of the local environment .",
    "this work then clarifies that for bulk water @xmath0 = 0.26  nm , rather than 0.28  nm , if those chemical contributions are to be negligible .",
    "moreover , suitable values of @xmath0 require additional scrutiny for different local environments .",
    "the present theory helps to gauge the significance of the various features of the interactions for the molecular of liquid water . as an example consider the case of an interaction model with near - neighbor - ranged interactions only .",
