    "the endeavor to explain the observed statistical patterns of species abundance , distribution and diversity in ecological communities and to reveal the general mechanisms responsible for these patterns motivated a great number of scientific works in theoretical ecology and statistical physics in the last decades .",
    "initial attempts in this sense consisted in fitting statistical distributions to species abundance data of various samples without paying attention to the underlying ecological processes @xcite .",
    "theories counting the presence of some governing forces in the development of the structure and biodiversity of ecological communities have been also elaborated .",
    "the traditional theory of niche differentiation attributes this guiding force to competition @xcite . according to this approach , each species in a given community is the best competitor in its own ecological niche ,",
    "therefore no two or more species can coexist in the same niche for a long time . in the view of the niche - assembly theory",
    ", species can live together in a community only when they exhibit differences from one another in the use of the available resources .",
    "this approach proved to be successful in describing the distribution and abundance of species in various environments @xcite , but evidently , it has some difficulties in explaining the richness of species often observed in communities comprising ecologically similar species , such as tropical forests . the neutral theory @xcite , introduced as an alternative to the niche theory , proposed a striking aspect : it propagates the functional equivalence of trophically similar species and attributes the key role to randomness as a driving force in the development of the observed ecological patterns .    since its publication",
    ", the neutral theory has received much attention .",
    "this new approach provided the first models to explain species abundance based on fundamental biological processes of species extinction , immigration or speciation @xcite .",
    "the striking similarities with classical statistical physics models mad it very attractive for the physics community @xcite . despite their amazing simplicity , neutral models produced accurate predictions for some taxa @xcite",
    ". however , the assumption of functional equivalence of individuals regardless of species in an ecological community has generated serious debates among ecologists @xcite . in these days",
    ", the neutral approach is more and more received as a null model of community dynamics and attempts are made to bridge it to the niche - assembly theory @xcite .",
    "the neutral theory of biodiversity is considered analogous to the neutral theory of molecular evolution in population genetics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the neutral theory in ecology traces back to the theory of island biogeography @xcite and extends it by taking into account speciation and the number of coexisting species as well . in this simple approach space",
    "is modeled implicitly : a local community is considered where speciation balances extinction by receiving migrants from a large external source pool ( metacommunity ) and its dynamics is realized at the level of individuals .",
    "besides the functional equivalence of all individuals of all the species in a local community , the neutral theory also assumes a constant size of the community predicting zero - sum multinomial distribution for the species abundance distribution .",
    "application of neutral models to describe the relative species abundance ( rsa ) distribution of tropical rain forest communities turned out to be especially resultful . in hubbell s model",
    "@xcite , the ecological drift , without any additional mechanisms , is sufficient to produce patterns of species diversity and abundance in accordance with those observed in nature . in the past decade , a series of neutral models based on hubbell s simple spatially implicit model have been developed @xcite .",
    "recently , models with various spatial structures @xcite and spatially explicit models @xcite have been introduced .",
    "such neutral models present the metacommunity in a more realistic way and are able to capture to a larger extent the effect of individual birth , death , dispersal and speciation processes .",
    "spatially explicit neutral models performed well in the prediction of the observed species - area relationships ( sar ) in tropical tree communities . while the simplicity of spatially implicit ( mean - field type ) models facilitates their analytical treatment , the more complex spatially explicit models exhibit limited analytical tractability .    in the present work a spatially explicit neutral model for tropical tree diversity patterns",
    "is introduced and studied .",
    "there are a great number of ecological patterns worthy of note but reproduction of all these patterns simultaneously exceeds the ability of current modeling approaches . however , the importance of fitting multiple patterns at the same time is undisputed as this could better reveal the correct contribution of ecological processes to shaping real ecological communities .",
    "the motivation of this paper comes thus from the endeavor to construct a simple spatially explicit neutral model that , besides the most studied rsa and sar measures , can effectively capture another experimentally verifiable macroecological measure , the spatial distribution of individuals of a species , characterized by e.g. the spatial autocorrelation function ( saf ) .    in the literature",
    "there are spatial models that can reproduce the observed species abundance distribution together with the species - area scaling , however , the applicability of these models to reproduce in the same time the observed spatial distribution of individuals of a species generally is not investigated or attempts concerning this purpose failed .",
    "our previously developed spatially explicit neutral model @xcite also shows this limited efficiency . while it is successful in reproducing the measured rsa and sar in tropical tree communities , it produces exponential - type decay for the spatial autocorrelation function ( saf ) of abundant species instead of the expected power - law type decay .",
    "our model is based on the diffusion of seeds @xcite , the diffusion assumed to be a simple random walk in the two dimensional space .",
    "the maximal surviving time of seeds defines the scale of the dispersal kernel , which describes the probability for an individual of a species to occupy locations at different distances in the ecosystem . for dispersal rule",
    ", one can find various assumptions in the literature @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite , the choice of the dispersal distance is crucial in seed diffusion models as it strongly influences the shape of the obtained species - area curves : on a log - log scale , models with nearest - neighbor dispersal result in convex curves , while models with global dispersal produce concave curves .",
    "the approach considered here is based on a three - parameter model , one of these parameters being a freely adjustable variable : the average surviving time of seeds ( common for all species in the local community ) .",
    "the other two parameters are set to realistic values corresponding to the investigated system .",
    "however , mention must be made of the incertitude of the speciation rate : since its value is difficult to measure in practice and in neutral models one can find values for this parameter taken from a wide range , the value of the speciation rate set here may also seem speculative .",
    "the size of the metacommunity is fixed according to the area of an extended region clearly delimited by natural borders ( e.g. a region delimited by see , ridge of mountains ) , surrounding the studied region . in real communities ,",
    "the dispersal of seeds can be influenced or restricted by properties of the natural environment itself .",
    "delimiting thus the size of the metacommunity , the model is adaptable to a spatial region where the dispersal process of seeds can be described properly by assuming the same dispersal rules . in this manner",
    "the model essentially provides a simple one - parameter fit for several macroecological measures of the investigated tropical tree community : rsa , sar , species number and saf .",
    "the model is applied here to reproduce the ecological patterns obtained for the barro colorado island ( bci ) tropical tree census @xcite , the oldest and most studied moist forest plot .",
    "a number of individual trees ( corresponding to the number of trees in the studied region of the bci plot ) are positioned on a uniform grid , representing the survey area in the model .",
    "computer simulation of the model is realized by using the backtracking coalescence technique , described in @xcite and applied in @xcite , a powerful simulation method for neutral models in ecology .",
    "this method , consisting of tracing lineages of all individuals originating in the survey area backward in time , until they speciate or coalesce , proved to be efficient for large and complex spatial structures ( even for the case of infinite landscapes ) . in the present study , around the survey area , a region corresponding to the area of the whole bci is involved in the calculations , representing the metacommunity , and a speciation rate for tropical tree communities is assumed in the model .",
    "computer simulations of the model focus on the reproduction of the number of species , the relative species abundance distribution , the species - area scaling and the spatial distribution of individuals of abundant species in the bci plot , by investigating the effect of the average surviving time of the seeds .",
    "since the model has only one freely adjustable parameter , our goal to reproduce simultaneously all the mentioned macro - ecological measures seems quite ambitious . in such case",
    "one should not expect to obtain better fits for all these measures than the fits provided by different models focusing on specified ecological measures , considering only one or just a few of them from the whole set of relevant characteristics .",
    "fitting only one or two of these measures can definitely result in considerably better fits , however , neglecting completely the reproduction of other important properties .",
    "in our view a successful model should provide a description for all the measurable macroecological patterns , and we consider thus that obtaining acceptable qualitative fits , simultaneously valid for the relevant measures , is more important than an excellent fit for one or just a few measures .",
    "as experimental data , the bci tropical tree census data is used @xcite . based on this , the relevant macroecological measures are defined and compared with simulation outcomes .",
    "the bci , administrated by the smithsonian tropical research institute , a biological reserve from 1923 , is located in the gatun lake , panama .",
    "the island is covered with moist forest . since 1980 ,",
    "a 50 @xmath0 ( 1000 m @xmath1 500 m ) region is regularly mapped , in each census all free standing woody stems with a stem diameter at least 1 cm at breast height are identified , tagged and recorded .",
    "the whole dataset contains information on about 240000 stems of more than 300 tree and shrub species , based on this , accurate statistics can be made .",
    "census data is publicly available for several years .    in this",
    "work census data from the year 1995 is used . for this year , 243541 individuals of 302 species with at least 1 cm stem diameter can be found in the dataset . analyzing the density of individuals in the 50 ha plot ,",
    "a less populated region can be identified in the western part of it , corresponding to a swampland in the studied area ( this pattern is observable independently of census year ) . to ensure homogeneity when calculating the ecological characteristics ,",
    "only a subregion of the entire plot , limited to the eastern 500 m @xmath1 500 m section , is considered .",
    "this 25 @xmath0 region contains 112543 trees and shrubs of 273 species .",
    "we investigate a local community in a spatial region of size @xmath2 embedded in a much larger territory ( e.g. island , continent , infinite land ) .",
    "our model follows the idea formulated in @xcite with the notable difference in the determination of the used dispersal kernel : instead of postulating a dispersal kernel without arguing its relation to ecological processes , here it is derived from a real physical process based on the diffusion of seeds .",
    "following separately the random motion of each seed is a computationally demanding task due to the large number of individuals and seeds present in the considered community , therefore a statistical description of the spatial distribution of seeds is considered .",
    "our basic hypothesis is that from time to time one individual dies and its place is taken by a new individual originating from a randomly chosen seed found in its neighborhood .",
    "it is assumed that ( i ) each individual emits the same number of seeds at each time - step , which randomly diffuse in the 2d space by a simple unbiased random walk ; ( ii ) the seeds survive @xmath3 time steps , after which they die and become unable to grow ; ( iii ) all the seeds ( even those belonging to different species ) have the same diffusion constant and the same surviving period @xmath3 .",

    "individuals are placed to a uniform square grid ( @xmath4 ) , labeled by grid coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "the black circles represents individuals in traced  active  lineages , color circles stand for lineages finalized by speciation . ]",
    "a simple two - dimensional unbiased random walk is assumed for all the seeds .",
    "the @xmath6 numbers are computed for each pair of individuals , according to the basic statistical properties of simple random walks .",
    "it is assumed that in unit time a seed can make a unit step defined as the grid constant @xmath8 , randomly moving to an individual in the neighborhood of its current position in a similar manner as the simple unbiased 2d random walker .",
    "this defines the time - unit in the simulations . in such case",
    "the probability @xmath9 to find the random walker at position @xmath10 after @xmath11 number of steps when started from coordinates @xmath12 writes as : @xmath13    assuming that the seeds can survive @xmath3 time steps , the number of seeds originating from @xmath12 that will be in position @xmath10 can be calculated as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a constant that quantifies the number of seeds emitted by individuals in unit time .",

    "the @xmath21 quantities are defined for all the @xmath22 pairs .",
    "initially all the lineages are traced using the coalescence technique @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the model is defined by the following rules :    * in each step one individual is randomly selected from all the lineages being traced at that moment and its @xmath5 grid coordinates are determined .",
    "the selected individual is the one that was most recently born .",
    "the origin of this individual has to be defined . * with probability @xmath23",
    ", speciation happens in the lineage . if speciation takes place , tracing of the lineage is stopped and the selected individual is considered to be the root of a new species . * with probability @xmath24",
    ", a parent is defined for the selected individual .",
    "the position of the parent is chosen according to the dispersal kernel .",
    "coalescence occurs when two lineages share the same spatial position .",
    "the parent selection mechanism of the last rule is done by respecting the weights given by the @xmath25 values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kernel ] ) . based on these values ,",
    "a seed originating from an individual at @xmath7 is chosen , thus , the individual at @xmath7 which emitted the `` successful '' seed reproduces itself at the position @xmath5 .",
    "this selection process realizes the simple unbiased two - dimensional diffusion of seeds in the considered area , allowing also seeds originating from distant locations to reach and occupy the vacant position .",
    "the above defined dynamical model can be easily implemented in a computer simulation .",
    "large systems , containing the same number of individuals as a known experimental dataset , can be studied in reasonable computational time .     in the neighborhood of a given position originating from a location at distance @xmath26 as a function of the distance calculated for different values of the seed survival time , @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath26 is measured in units of the grid constant @xmath8 . ]",
    "the model described above is applied here to study the tropical forest community of bci . in principle , for a fixed community with @xmath27 individuals the model has three parameters : the lifetime of the seeds @xmath3 , the size of the surrounding metacommunity and the speciation rate , @xmath23 . as experimental data , we use census data for the eastern ( square like ) half part of the whole sampled territory ( 25 ha ) of bci for the year 1995 .",
    "the total number of individuals in this region , @xmath28 , is 112543 . in order to have the number of individuals in the model in accordance with the experimental number of individuals , the uniform @xmath4 square grid is constructed with @xmath29=335 .",

    "is realized in this larger grid , the position of parents , selected according to the proposed dispersal kernel , can be positions in this larger grid .",
    "simulations have been performed by fixing the value of the speciation rate at a value comparable to the mutation rate of a neutral gene . in agreement with the accepted order of magnitude in the literature",
    "@xcite , @xmath30 is set as speciation rate and the maximum seed survival period @xmath3 is varied from 50 to 5000 steps in searching for a @xmath3 parameter reproducing the experimental value of the total number of species ( @xmath31 ) and the other observed ecological patterns . as already stated in the introduction ,",
    "our model is essentially a one - parameter model , since fixing the speciation rate and the size of the metacommunity , we are left with only one freely adjustable fitting parameter .",
    "apart of the total number of individuals and species in the considered local community there are several relevant distributions that should be compared with the census data . for",
    "a detailed description of these quantities one could consult our previous work @xcite .",
    "for the spatial distribution of species and individuals two relevant quantities are calculated and compared with experimental results : the species - area relationship ( sar ) and the spatial autocorrelation function ( saf ) of individuals belonging to the same species .",
    "the sar is studied by considering larger and larger territories and counting the number of species present within these areas .",
    "average species numbers are calculated on subregions with the same size , the sar curve representing these averages as a function of the considered area    the saf , denoted by @xmath32 for species @xmath33 , is constructed in the following way : a uniform mesh ( not necessarily the same division as for the mesh of the simulation ) is considered on the studied area and in each ( @xmath34 ) cell of this mesh , the number of individuals @xmath35 from the considered species is determined . the auto - correlation function for a relative coordinate ( @xmath36 )",
    "is calculated as    @xmath37    here @xmath38 denotes the average number of individuals of the considered species on the mesh sites : @xmath39 .",
    "the average of the @xmath40 values for all ( @xmath36 ) mesh coordinates that are inside a ring with radius @xmath26 and width @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , considering a reasonably small @xmath41 value , leads to our definition of saf : @xmath43    another important quantity that should be also compared with the experimental results is the relative species abundance ( rsa ) distribution .",
    "this distribution characterizes the frequency of species with a given abundance .",
    "different types of representations are generally used to study rsa . the most widespread method to present species abundances is due to f.  w.  preston @xcite , who sorted the species of a sample into abundance intervals of consecutively doubling lengths ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , etc . ) , and plotted the number of species found within these `` octaves '' .",
    "this kind of plotting is motivated by the fact that species abundances can vary over several orders of magnitude and usually there are fewer abundant species than rare ones . this way the presence of large statistical fluctuations at the tail of the curve can be avoided .",
    "a second way of representing the species - abundance distribution is plotting the associated probability density function @xmath47 , i.e. the probability for finding a species with a given @xmath48 abundance .",
    "@xmath47 can be derived from the preston plot by dividing the number of species in each interval with the length of the interval , and plotting on a double logarithmic plot this quantity versus the mean abundance in the given interval .",
    "a third way of representing the species abundance distribution can be realized by arranging the species in decreasing order by their abundances and plotting the rank of the species versus its abundance ( rank - abundance plot ) again on a double - logarithmic graph .",
    "this representation is inspired by several abundance studies in sociology and economics , leading to the general pareto - zipf distribution .",

    "simulation curves are averaged results of 100 runs .",
    "it should be noted that in the simulations , even if the total number of species is the same as in the bci census , the number of individuals of the most abundant species can show considerable fluctuations , this is the reason why the simulation curves are vertically shifted relative to the bci results .     seed surviving period with fixed speciation rate ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "results obtained for the five most abundant species in the barro colorado island ( bci ) census data are shown with lines ( census year : 1995 ) . ]    from the sar and saf results one can learn that the spatial distribution of the species and individuals are comparable to the experimental ones for @xmath54 steps .",

    "following the third measure of interest , the rsa , as a function of @xmath3 , the @xmath55 steps case proves to be the most appropriate to reflect the characteristic ecological measures of the bci plot ( figure [ fig : rsa ] ) . for this case",
    ", the average difference in the simulation and experimental results is quite high : 53 @xmath60 .",

    "focus on their reproduction , the spatial distribution of individuals of a given species draws less attention . for the bci plot and for not too big distances , the saf curves exhibit power - law decay .",
