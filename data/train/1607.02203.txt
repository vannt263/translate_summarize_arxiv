    "collective coherent quantum effects existing in a many - body system can be enhanced via strong couplings .",

    "in cavity qed , the cavity - assisted atom - field coupling presents a @xmath1 collective enhancement for atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "in particular , ensembles of highly excited rydberg atoms offer a robust platform for studying quantum correlation and collective effect by engineering the strength , range , direction of rydberg interactions . in rydberg atoms",
    "the competition between laser pumping and interatomic interaction ensures that only one rydberg atomic excitation can be accommodated within the blockade sphere due to the energy level shifts induced by the surrounding atoms @xcite , giving rise to a @xmath1 enhancement to the atom - light coupling @xcite .",
    "interactions between two rydberg states can be isotropic van der waals ( vdws)-type or anisotropic dipole - dipole - type , depending on the magnitude of the applied electric field @xcite .",
    "the vdws interaction often occurs at large detunings where the dipole moment of atoms is temporary and weak , and it has been directly measured by experiments @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dipole - dipole interactions ( ddis ) in the presence of strong external fields is essentially long - range and anisotropic .",
    "since the angular dependence ( anisotropy ) of ddis has been studied in various geometries @xcite , controlling over the strength of ddis by varying the magnitude and direction of electric field has found applications in the implementation of quantum information protocols @xcite or in the quantum simulation of many - body spin systems @xcite .    to focus on the anisotropy of interactions ,",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular configuration with three atoms is priorly preferred because in the case of @xmath2 some atom pairs necessarily have an interatomic axis that is not aligned along the quantization axis @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ddis among three interacting atoms can cause breakup or reduction to the blockade effect owing to the cooperative behavior of different energy exchange channels @xcite , which further make the excitation properties of three atoms qualitatively differ from that of two - atom systems @xcite . in the present work , we study the angular - dependent rydberg excitations in a three - atom system in which the strength of ddis between atoms can be manipulated by the direction of an external electric field . for special directions where the interaction vanishes between two of three atoms , which is so - called _ resonance _ in our paper ,",
    "we observe enhanced probability of single collective excitations in the case of full blockade due to the cooperativity . for comparison we also consider the case of partial blockade where we find the double and triple collective state populations are enhanced due to weaker interactions and imperfect blockade effect .    also , to investigate collective effect between pairs of atoms , we compute the two - atom quantum correlation coefficient and find that the collective excitation enhancement at resonance could significantly affect the correlation properties between atoms , giving rise to positive correlation even in full blockade . besides , we study the change of rydberg blockade sphere characterized by the blockade radius , and a strong reduction to it at resonance is found , accounting for the imperfect blockade .",

    "<S> we investigate the collective excitation effect in a scheme where three identical rydberg atoms are arranged in an equilateral triangular lattice . by using a static electric field polarizing </S>",
    "<S> the atomic dipoles , the dipole - dipole interactions between two rydberg atoms are essentially anisotropic and can even disappear in the several special resonance cases . </S>",
    "<S> for that fact , we observe collectively enhanced excitation probability of single rydberg atom in resonant areas in the case of strong blockade , and that of double or triple rydberg atoms in the case of partial blockade . to give more evidences for this collective excitation enhancement , we study the two - body quantum correlation between three rydberg atoms , as well as the dependence of the blockade radius on the length of triangle sides , which present a good agreement with the excitation properties . </S>"
