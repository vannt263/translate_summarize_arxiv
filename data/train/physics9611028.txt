    "young s two slit experiment is the canonical experiment demonstrating the wave nature of light . with the addition of a measuring device to determine which slit",
    "the photon has passed through , the phenomenon of wave - particle duality can be investigated .",
    "many such path detection schemes have been proposed in the past , such as the einstein recoiling slit @xcite and feynman s light microscope @xcite .",
    "recently , interest has arisen in the interference of the fluorescent light from two driven atoms which play the role of the slits in young s experiment .",
    "various situations have been theoretically studied , using two - level and four - level atoms , and the possibility of placing the atoms in a cavity has also been considered.@xcite    in a recent experiment performed by eichmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the light scattered by two @xmath0 ions in a trap was observed . in this experiment ,",
    "a linearly - polarized traveling wave coherent field was used to drive the ions and the scattered light was observed in two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "an interference pattern is observed in one case but not in the other .",
    "these results were explained in two ways , firstly in terms of a which - path argument based on ways in which a single photon can interact with the two atoms and secondly in terms of a theoretical analysis by polder _  _ and schuurmans _  _ @xcite who considered coherent driving of a _ single _ four - level atom .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out an analysis which considers the presence of both atoms and stress that for the coherent steady - state excitation as used in the experiment , the which - path argument is not applicable . in sections",
    "[ sec : analy ] to [ sec : expt ] , we extend the analysis of polder _  _ and schuurmans to the experimental situation . in brief ,",
    "the atomic dipoles are only coherently driven in a specific direction given by the polarization of the incident light field , and so interference is only expected for scattered light of that polarization . scattered",
    "light of the orthogonal polarization is also present , since the atoms can decay spontaneously , but this is incoherent with the driving field and does not lead to interference .    besides the above analysis which is carried out using the master equation ,",
    "a monte carlo wave function simulation was also carried out , as is discussed in sections  [ sec : mcwf ] and  [ sec : num ] .",
    "we use the method to simulate the system without resorting to the assumptions of large atomic separation and independent radiators used in the previous analytical sections .",
    "when a fluorescent photon is detected as traveling in a given direction , it may not be possible in general to determine from which atom it arose , and this leads to additional `` dipole - dipole '' type of terms which become important when the atomic separation is comparable to the optical wavelength . at small separations ,",
    "the atoms act cooperatively giving rise to superfluorescence whereas for large separations , we smoothly recover the results for independent radiators .    in order to compare our results with the experiment",
    ", we include the effects of the classical motion of the ions within the trap ( sec .",
    "[ sec : class_motion ] ) . as expected , this reduces the visibility of the interference patterns , bringing the results more closely to those observed .    in the last section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : one_photon ] ) we consider a situation where the two atom system is re - prepared to its initial state after each individual photon has been detected .",
    "this allows us to study the transient regime of this system and we find that interference is present in both polarizations , although one of these disappears in the steady - state . depending on the initial state however , the visibility of this transient pattern varies , and a which - path argument may be used in this case to explain the results .",
    "the atoms are modeled as four - level atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_4latom ] ) interacting with a linearly polarized light field polarized along the @xmath1 axis and traveling along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "we treat the incident laser light as a classical field and the external motion of the atoms will be neglected .",
    "the separation between the atoms will be considered to be large ( many wavelengths of the laser light ) so that dipole - dipole interactions can be ignored . in this approximation",
    "the atoms can be considered as independent fixed sources except that their radiation is synchronized by the definite phase of the incident laser light .",
    "the atomic dipole operator @xmath3 is the sum of atomic raising @xmath4 and lowering @xmath5 operators whose components are given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the _ k _ component of the atomic dipole , @xmath8 is the dipole matrix element , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the usual cartesian unit vectors . the atomic operator @xmath12 couples the @xmath13th and @xmath14th levels of the atom .",
    "the system hamiltonian for one of the atoms in the interaction picture is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the detuning between the atomic transition and the incident laser light . for simplicity , the ground states ( and the excited states )",
    "are considered to be degenerate in energy ( see fig .",

    "there are sixteen optical bloch equations corresponding to the sixteen atomic operators . however , due to the geometry chosen for the incident light , the sixteen equations de - couple into two sets of eight .",
    "the first set of coupled equations involve the populations and the `` linear coherences '' ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 terms ) which relate to the @xmath1 component of the atomic dipole ( see eqn .",

    "as expected from the symmetry of the situation , the populations of the two ground states are equal as are the populations of the two excited states .    a graph of the populations versus laser light strength is shown in fig .",

    "there is a gradual loss of coherence as the field is further increased due to the saturation of the atom . at low field strengths the atom spends most of its time in the ground state and",
    "is very rarely pumped to the excited states .",
    "it behaves like a coherently driven linear oscillator and scatters coherently . in the strong field case , the atom undergoes rabi oscillations and is frequently pumped to the excited states from which it spontaneously decays .",
    "these spontaneous emission events destroy the coherences .",
    "the second set of equations consist of the `` cross coherences '' ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and the coherences between the ground @xmath37 and between the excited states @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 the other four equations for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the hermitian conjugates of these equations . solving this set of equations in the steady - state",
    "we find that only the trivial solution remains so that all these coherences ultimately vanish .",
    "any initial coherences involving these terms are damped in the transient regime .",
    "since the cross coherences , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , determine the @xmath46 and @xmath2 components of the atomic dipole ( see eqn .",
    "[ dip01]-[dip03 ] ) , there is no interference from light polarized in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "we have calculated in the previous section the steady - state solutions for the atomic coherences and populations for the case of a single four - level atom interacting with a classical laser light field linearly polarized along the @xmath1 axis . in this section",
    "we wish to use these to calculate the far - field interference pattern from two such atoms in the case when their separation is large enough that they may be treated independently .",
    "let us consider a screen placed in the far - field ( large @xmath2 ) and oriented in the @xmath48 plane . in the far - field , and in the paraxial approximation , the electric field at a point on the screen at time @xmath49 due to an oscillating dipole is proportional to the projection onto the plane of the screen of the acceleration of the dipole moment at the retarded time @xmath50where @xmath51 is the light travel time from the dipole to the observation point .",

    "@xcite the incident laser is linearly polarized at an angle of @xmath72 degrees to the @xmath1 axis in the @xmath73 plane .",

    "this less than `` ideal '' measured visibility is not surprising since many detrimental factors have not been included in the analytical treatment .",
    "factors such as stray light entering the detector and quantum jumps to other levels in the mercury ions so that we may observe only the fluorescence from one ion.@xcite the motion of the ions in the trap also smear out the interference pattern , this will be discuss in detail in a later section .",
    "in this section , we describe the use of a monte carlo wave function method for numerical simulation of the system .",
    "this approach allows greater flexibility in specifying the geometry of the incident light and also allows us to include the photodetection process as part of the simulation . by doing this ,",
    "we no longer simply relate the far field intensity of the fluorescent light to the moments of the atomic variables , but explicitly consider how atomic quantum jumps introduce photons into electromagnetic field modes propagating in various directions .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it allows the atoms to be separated by arbitrary distances and takes into account the dipole - dipole correlations between the atoms .",
    "this simulation approach is very closely related to the actual experimental situation as it gives a time - resolved classical record of photocounts at different angles which gradually build up into an interference pattern .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume idealized unit efficiency photodetectors in the far field covering the entire @xmath80 steradians surrounding the two atoms .",
    "each detector is assumed to be polarization - sensitive and resolves detected photons into two orthogonal linear polarizations . working in spherical polar coordinates with polar angle @xmath81 and azimuthal angle @xmath77 ( see fig .",

    "we are assuming here that the incident light is propagating at right angles to the line joining the two atoms .",
    "the relaxation superoperator is in lindblad form @xmath96 where the collapse operators @xmath97 correspond to the couplings between system and the baths .",
    "when the atoms are far apart , they may be regarded as coupling to independent baths and so collapses associated with one atom may be distinguished from those associated with the other . if we explicitly include the photodetection scheme , the appropriate collapse operators are parameterized by the direction and polarization of the outgoing photon . for spontaneous emission from a single two - level atom ,",
    "the appropriate collapse operators ( including recoil ) are @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the atomic position operator , @xmath100 is the wave number of the outgoing photon traveling in direction @xmath101 , @xmath102 is an operator proportional to the atomic lowering operator ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 labels the outgoing polarization .",
    "for our situation with two fixed atoms , @xmath99 may be replaced by the locations of the two atoms @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( see fig .",

    "this is valid because the characteristic time scale of the stretch mode @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) is far longer than the atomic half - life @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "the steady - state regime is satisfied since the duration of a simulation , @xmath178 , producing one hundred thousand photodetections is approximately @xmath179 which is much longer than the time scale of the stretch mode .",
    "the effects of the tilting motion is to shift the interference pattern .",
    "thus during the simulation whenever we calculate a photodetection , the direction of the photon needs to be shifted according to the current displacement of the tilting modes .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath2 displacements are randomly generated from a harmonic oscillator probability distribution .",
    "in hindsight we could have generated @xmath1 displacements from a harmonic oscillator distribution as well , however in the simulations we have chosen to keep track of the stretch mode starting from some arbitrary value .",
    "both methods are equivalent for the steady - state regime .",
    "the requirements on the time scales involved is    @xmath180    as expected , when classical motion is included in the simulation , the visibility of the interference is reduced , see fig .",
    "[ fig_motion](b ) .",
    "we see an interference pattern with the peaks placed in the same positions as fig .",
    "[ fig_motion](b ) but with a reduced visibility of about @xmath181 .",
    "the visibility for individual peaks degrades as one deviates from the central peak at ninety degrees .",
    "this maybe explained by the fact that we have modeled the motion along the @xmath1 axis as a stretching where the center - of - mass remains stationary , thus the central peak is in the same position whatever the period .",
    "as one deviates to the sides , a small change in period has a increasingly larger effect on the position of the peak .",
    "the parameters used in this simulation for the motion were : stretch frequency @xmath182 mhz , tilt frequencies @xmath183 mhz ( for both modes ) , radial confinement was @xmath184 and the amplitude of the stretch mode was @xmath185 .",
    "experimental results were shown in the paper by eichmann _",
    "for this set of parameters .",
    "the visibility was about @xmath79 which is less than the value obtained in the simulation .",
    "the greater visibility in the simulation is not unexpected since the effects of stray light and the fact that @xmath186 ions are not ideal four - level atoms would further reduce the visibility .",
    "so far we have investigated the steady - state regime which corresponds to the experimental situation .",
    "however the transient regime is also interesting because it is then possible to consider the which - path argument which explains the disappearance of an interference pattern as being due to information of which atom has undergone an emission being somehow recorded in the system .",
    "this knowledge can be obtained for some initial atomic states but not others .    in this section",
    ", we consider that the two atoms are initialized to some known state and then are exposed to the incident light .",
    "when the first fluorescence photon is detected , the experiment is stopped and the atoms are re - initialized to the original state . over many trials , an interference pattern may develop in the far field , and it is this pattern which is of interest .",
    "let us first consider the case where the initial joint atomic state is latexmath:[$%    @xmath1 direction so that the @xmath188 transition is driven .",
    "when one of the atoms has been excited to the state @xmath189 , it may decay either to the state @xmath190 or to the state @xmath191 if the decay is to state @xmath192 the final state of the atoms is again @xmath193 and it is not possible to tell from which atom the light came from .",
    "we thus expect that the detection of light polarized in the @xmath134 direction which is sensitive to radiation from the @xmath194 transition will exhibit interference . on the other hand , if the excited atom decays to state @xmath195 the final state of the atoms is either @xmath196 or @xmath197 leaving a record of the atom responsible for the emission .",
    "we thus expect light detected with polarization in the @xmath135 direction to not exhibit any interference at all .",
    "the results of a simulation with this initial state are shown in fig .",
    "[ graph_tran1](a ) for @xmath134 polarization and in fig .",
    "[ graph_tran1](b ) for @xmath135 polarization .",
    "the atomic separation was @xmath198 and the ratio of rabi frequency to decay rate is @xmath79 as before .",
    "as expected , a very distinct interference pattern can be seen in ( a )  consisting of five peaks .",
    "the visibility is about @xmath199 , this is quite close to the expected theoretical value of about @xmath150 . for the same set of parameters this transient simulation gives higher visibility than the corresponding steady - state simulation .",
    "also as expected , no interference is seen in ( b ) .",
    "let us now consider the initial joint atomic state @xmath200 in this case , it is not possible to distinguish the atom responsible for emitting the photon whether it is detected in the @xmath201 or the @xmath135 polarizations .",
    "we thus expect to see interference for both polarizations .",
    "the result of the simulation for the @xmath202 polarization is shown in fig .",
    "[ graph_tran2 ] , confirming that this interference does occur in the transient regime .",
    "as discussed previously however , since the driving field is polarized in the @xmath1 direction , this coherence must approach zero in the steady - state and there can be no steady - state interference pattern , although interference does occur in the transient regime .",
    "we have used extreme parameters so far , for the case of the @xmath193 initial state we know for certain that each atom is initially in a particular ground state and for the other initial state ( @xmath203 ) we have no initial preference for which ground state each of the atoms are in . in fig .",
    "[ graph_tran3 ] results for the @xmath135 polarization are shown for an initial state @xmath204 in this intermediate case , there is some visibility in the transient interference pattern , but this is only about a third , lower than that seen in the previous case .    in the transient regime",
    "we expect interference in the undriven polarization which does not appear in the steady - state regime for the majority of the possible initial states .",
    "the interference we see here is due to the presence of initial coherences .",
    "it is similar to the case of two two - level atoms prepared in the excited states , one would eventually decay emitting a photon in the process .",
    "the atoms are then re - prepared in the excited states and the process is repeated to build up an intensity pattern .",
    "it is not important in this regime whether there is coherent driving or not but only that the atoms are excited to higher levels thus giving them an opportunity to undergo spontaneous emission .",
    "we have analyzed the experiment by eichmann _",
    "et al . _ and presented theoretical models for understanding the degree of interference observed for different incident and detected polarizations .",
    "for a simple geometry of the incident field , it is possible to solve the optical bloch equations analytically for a single four - level atom in the steady - state , and to extend this result to the case of two atoms , assuming that they radiate independently . from this analysis ,",
    "the fluorescent light is seen to consist of a coherent component which exhibits interference and an incoherent component which does not .",
    "these components may be separated out by polarizers before the light is detected .    in order to model the actual geometry of the source polarization used in the experiment , a numerical technique based on the monte carlo wave function method was used . in this method ,",
    "the photodetection process is simulated so that the interference pattern builds up gradually from a series of detections at various angles .",
    "this qualitatively reproduces the experimental results and also allowed us to consider dipole - dipole interactions which become important when the atomic separation is reduced .    to more closely simulate the experimental configuration , classical motion of the ions was included in the simulation",
    "this reduces the visibility of the interference to a value closer to the experimental result .",
    "the residual discrepancy is probably due to the approximation of modeling the ions as four - level atoms and experimental factors such as the presence of stray light on the observation screen .",
    "finally , we demonstrated the formation of a transient interference pattern in situations where there is no steady - state pattern by resetting the atomic state to a specified initial condition after each photodetection . in this case",
    ", a which - path argument can be used to understand the visibility of the transient patterns .",
    "we would like to thank w. itano and d. wineland for useful discussions .",
    "this research was supported by the university of auckland research committee and the marsden fund of the royal society of new zealand ."
