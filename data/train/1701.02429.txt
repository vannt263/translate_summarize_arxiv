    "in the last two decades , the idea that our universe is embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime has attracted much attention since arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite and randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite were presented .",
    "extra dimensions not only provide a new view of spacetime , but also can solve some outstanding problems that the standard model can not deal with , such as dark matter @xcite , dark energy @xcite , gauge hierarchy problem @xcite , and cosmology constant problem @xcite .",
    "many interesting phenomena have been found based on braneworld theories , especially the rs models and their extensions @xcite , where the brane is assumed infinitely thin .",
    "however , the brane should have a thickness from a realistic point of view because there exists a smallest scale in a fundamental theory .",
    "when the energy corresponding to the thickness of the brane is as large as the one we are concerned about , the thickness of the brane can not be neglected .",
    "therefore , some thick brane models @xcite have been presented , where these branes with thickness are generated by scalar fields coupled with gravity . in this thick brane scenario ,",
    "the brane is explained as a domain wall where our four - dimensional universe is located . a thick brane ( also called as domain wall ) model is usually based on the minimal ( or nonminimal ) coupling between gravity and one or several bulk scalar fields @xcite .",
    "one can also use vector fields @xcite or pure geometry @xcite to generate a thick brane . see refs .",
    "@xcite for more comprehensive reviews of various thick branes .    in the thin braneworld scenario @xcite ,",
    "matter fileds are assumed to be confined on the brane , and only gravity is free to propagate on the brane and in the bulk .",
    "however , in thick braneworld scenario , all fields ( including gravity and matter fields ) are in the bulk .",
    "therefore , the zero modes of all matter fields , which stand for our four - dimensional matter fields , should be localized on the brane in order not to contradict with the low - energy experiments",
    ". thus , localization of bulk matter fields is a significant and interesting topic in thick braneworld theories , and it is meaningful to explore how to confine matter fields on the brane in a natural way . in general , free massless scalar fields can be localized on the rs - type brane @xcite .",
    "free vector fields can not be localized on the rs - type brane embedded in five - dimensional spacetime , but they can be localized on the rs brane embedded in some higher - dimensional spacetime @xcite or some de - sitter thick branes with finite extra dimension @xcite or weyl thick branes @xcite . in recent years , some new and interesting localization mechanisms have been introduced @xcite for vector fields .",
    "since the most elementary particles composing the matters in our four - dimensional universe are spin@xmath5 fermions , it is very important to study localization of fermions on brane in thick braneworld theories .",
    "there are many works ( see for examples refs .",
    "@xcite ) that study the characteristics of the fermion localization . in the brane models where the branes are generated by one or several scalar fields",
    ", one can introduce the coupling between fermions and the background scalar fields to trap fermions on the branes . when the background scalar field is an odd function of the extra dimension , a usual choice is the yukawa coupling between fermions and the background scalar field @xcite .",
    "however , when the background scalar field is an even function of the extra dimension , in order to get an effective potential function with @xmath4 symmetry along the extra dimension , the yukawa coupling can not work any more . in order to solve the problem ,",
    "other coupling mechanism is needed . in the recent paper @xcite",
    ", the authors adopted the following derivative coupling @xmath6 for which the scalar field can be an odd or even function of the extra dimension .",
    "if there are even and odd background scalars in the thick brane model , one can also consider both the above mentioned couplings at the same time @xcite .",
    "it is clear that all the previous localization mechanisms for fermions are based on the introduction of the background scalar fields .",
    "however , there are some thick brane models without scalar fields @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "both mechanisms mentioned above are no longer applicable , so a new coupling mechanism should be introduced . to this end",
    ", we would like to consider the role of gravity .",
    "gravity will always exist in various brane models since it is a geometric property of space - time .",
    "inspired by the non - minimal coupling between gravity and other matter fields ( called as geometrical coupling ) introduced in localization of other matter fields @xcite , we naturally think of non - minimal coupling between gravity and fermions .",
    "one of the most intuitive thoughts is to consider that the scalar curvature @xmath1 couples to fermion fields , namely the yukawa - like geometrical coupling @xmath7 ( the similar couplings have been considered for vector fields @xcite and elko spinor fields @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to get an effective potential with @xmath4 symmetry along the extra dimension , and because the scalar curvature is an even function of the extra dimension , we adopt the derivative geometrical coupling between gravity and fermions , like the one given in , rather than the yukawa - like coupling .",
    "this is inspired by the paper @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on the fermion localization and mass spectrum by considering the coupling @xmath8 .",
    "the new fermion localization mechanism depends on the brane structure and the form of @xmath3 .",
    "we will consider some specific forms of @xmath3 for three brane models to localize fermions on the branes .",
    "it will be shown that three kinds of well - known effective potentials ( volcano - like , p@xmath9schl - teller(pt)-like and harmonic - like potentials ) for the left- and right - chiral fermion kk modes can be obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we mainly introduce a new localization mechanism with a derivative geometrical coupling and derive the effective dirac action of the fermion kk modes including the four - dimensional massless and massive dirac fermions .",
    "we also obtain the effective potentials and the orthonormality conditions for the fermion kk modes . in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , we study three kinds of thick brane models as examples .",
    "the first model is about a sine - gordon brane generated by a single scalar field .",
    "we investigate three different forms of @xmath3 corresponding to three typical effective potentials and obtain the corresponding mass spectra for this model . in the second model , we also study a single - scalar - field - generated thick brane and calculate the mass spectrum of a fermion with @xmath10 . in particular , in the last model , we consider the case of a pure geometric braneworld . finally , a brief discussion and conclusion is presented in sec . [ section4 ] .",
    "in order to localize spin-@xmath11 fermions on a brane with codimension one , one usually needs to introduce some localization mechanisms . in this section",

    "<S> , we explore the coupling between a spinor field @xmath0 and the scalar curvature of spacetime @xmath1 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 a function of @xmath1 , to investigate localization of the fermion . because of @xmath4 symmetry of the extra dimension , the new coupling mechanism proposed here can easily deal with the problem encountered in the yukawa coupling with even background scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the new mechanism will also work for the branes without background scalar fields . by investigating three examples </S>",
    "<S> , we find that fermions can be localized on the branes with the new mechanism . </S>"
