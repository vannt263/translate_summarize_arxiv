    "high temperature superconductivity always attracts scientists working in different fields of physics and material science due to its extensive applications and extraordinary properties .",
    "a fundamental question of this topic is how to understand the origin of high temperature superconductivity  @xcite ?",
    "although preliminary consensus has been reached with respect to the high - t@xmath0 cuprates that strong correlation is indispensable for high temperature superconductivity  @xcite , intensive debates persist since the discovery of high - t@xmath0 iron - based superconductors .",
    "in contrast to the strongly - correlated high - t@xmath0 cuprates , magnetism and superconductivity in iron - based superconductors was originally proposed to be understandable from both the strong - coupling limit , where spin exchange effect of localized electrons is emphasized , and weak - coupling limit , where condensation of particle - hole excitations among the fermi surfaces is highlighted  @xcite . however , while conventional weak - coupling theory of the fermi surface nesting  @xcite is continuously being challenged as more experiments are performed  @xcite , the density functional theory calculations in combination with dynamical mean field theory do not support the existence of localized electrons in fe @xmath1 orbitals  @xcite .    recently , a compromised scenario for understanding the iron - based superconductors was proposed , where localized and itinerant electrons are assumed to coexist in fe @xmath1 orbitals  @xcite .",
    "though , angular resolved photoemission spectroscopic study on a@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4 ( @xmath5=k , rb ) , corroborated by a slave - spin mean - field calculation , pointed to a possible observation of such a coexistence at finite temperature  @xcite , it is still under debate experimentally whether the studied sample or which part of the studied sample is the parent compound of the superconducting state  @xcite . in other words , the detected coexistence may not be relevant to superconductivity .",
    "another origin for magnetism in iron - based superconductors was proposed based on comparisons of densities of states between nonmagnetic state and various magnetic states in fete and bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 obtained from density functional theory calculations .",
    "it was concluded that the magnetic ground state is determined by all occupied states below the fermi level , not by fermiology  @xcite .",
    "however , on one hand , strong downshift in spectral weight due to spin polarization usually happens in all the materials with large magnetic moment . on the other hand , as is well known , the magnetic moments in most iron - based compounds are overestimated by density functional theory calculations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this scenario is also questionable .    in this paper , by applying density functional theory calculations to various families of iron - based superconductors , we proposed that the condensed particle - hole excitations away from the fermi level , rather than those among the fermi surfaces , are responsible for the distinct physical properties among different iron - based compounds .",
    "we further pointed out that the orbital degrees of freedom , inter - atomic magnetic interaction , and interlayer couplings have to be involved in order to correctly understand some anomalies in iron - based compounds .",
    "we found that while the strong correlation is not indispensable if one wants to understand magnetism and superconductivity of iron - based materials at qualitative level , the electronic states above and below fermi level are both important .",
    "we use experimentally - determined structures for all the compounds ( see appendix  [ sec : app - one ] ) , i.e.  the [ 1111 ] family lnofepn with ln = sm , nd , ce , la and pn = as , p through to srffeas , the [ 111 ] family containing afepn with a = li , na , the [ 11 ] family fech with ch = se and te , and the [ 122 ] family including aefe@xmath4pn@xmath4 with ae = ca , sr , ba .",
    "we temporarily leave kfe@xmath4se@xmath4 to later study because the parent compound of its superconducting state is still under debate experimentally and the observed special magnetic states are always connected to different types of iron vacancies  @xcite .",
    "both the paramagnetic and spin - polarized cases are calculated by the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method as implemented in wien2k  @xcite with the exchange correlation functional of perdew , burke and ernzerho ( pbe ) .",
    "the results are consistent with those calculated within the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we choose rk@xmath6=7 and total 40000  k points in the brillouin - zone integration .",
    "the open core approximation is employed when the f electrons are treated in the nonmagnetic states . in the lda+u or",
    "the spin polarized gga+u calculations , f electrons of ce atoms are arranged ferromagnetically according to the experiments , and @xmath7 is chosen to be 6  ev  @xcite .",

    "it is well - known that prominent condensation of particle - hole excitations at certain wave vector of @xmath10 in a disordered phase is a precursor for an appearance of corresponding symmetry breaking state as temperature becomes lower or interaction is switched on . in most of the iron - based superconductors , a remarkable condensation present at wave vector of @xmath13 can account for the stripe - type antiferromagnetic order or superconductivity .",
    "( here we refer to a unit cell containing @xmath14 fe atoms . )",
    "more detailedly , if the condensation at @xmath13 is strong enough , i.e. , exceeds a threshold , stripe - type antiferromagnetic states tend to form .",

    "<S> the origin of magnetism and superconductivity in iron - based superconductors is still unclear . here , </S>",
    "<S> by investigating the momentum - dependent particle - hole excitations which quantify the tendency of itinerant electrons towards various magnetic states or superconducting phases , we unravel a novel origin to account for the variety of physical properties of iron - based compounds . </S>",
    "<S> we show that condensation of particle - hole excitations away from the fermi surface in momentum space is the underlying mechanism in deciding the magnetic and superconducting properties of iron - based materials . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of this scenario to the whole family of iron - based superconductors suggests that inclusion of the orbital degrees of freedom , which may lead to competing tendencies towards different magnetically ordered states , is more crucial than taking into account the strong correlations . </S>",
    "<S> our findings further indicate that in order to properly model these materials , the electronic states away from the fermi level have to be considered . </S>"
