    "we study the edwards - anderson ( ea ) spin glass model on an infinite graph @xmath3 of finite degree .",
    "we mostly take @xmath4 ( and further , @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 , a half - plane of @xmath7 .    for a finite set @xmath8 ,",
    "consider the set of spin configurations @xmath9 and for @xmath10 , the hamiltonian ( with free boundary conditions ) @xmath11 where the @xmath12 s ( the _ couplings _ ) are taken from an i.i.d .",
    "product measure @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the distribution of each @xmath12 is continuous with support equal to @xmath14 .",
    "for inverse temperature @xmath15 the gibbs measure for @xmath16 is @xmath17 as temperature approaches 0 ( @xmath18 ) the gibbs measure converges weakly to a sum of two delta masses , supported on the spin configurations with minimal value of @xmath19 .",
    "these spin configurations ( related by global flip ) can be seen to be characterized by the following local flip property : for each @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 here the set @xmath22 is defined as all edges @xmath23 such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the advantage is that this definition makes sense for infinite sets @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason , we define the _ set of ground states on the infinite graph @xmath26 at couplings @xmath27 _ by @xmath28 in other words , elements of @xmath29 are the spin configurations minimizing the hamiltonian locally for the coupling realization @xmath27 . clearly , @xmath30 if and only if @xmath31 .",
    "the goal of this paper is not to determine precisely the cardinality of @xmath29 but rather to rule out possibilities other than two or infinity .",
    "our main result is to prove such a claim in the case of the ea model on the two - dimensional half - plane .",
    "[ thm : mainthm ] for the ea model on the half - plane @xmath32 , the number of ground states @xmath33 is either @xmath34 with @xmath13-probability one or @xmath35 with @xmath13-probability one .      a main question in the theory of short - range spin glasses is to understand the structure of the set @xmath29 , and in particular its cardinality .",
    "this problem is the zero - temperature equivalent of understanding the structure and the cardinality of the set of pure states , the set of infinite - volume gibbs measures of the ea model that are extremal .",
    "it is easy to check that for @xmath36 , @xmath29 has only two elements : the flip - related configurations @xmath37 defined by the identity @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is not known how many elements are in @xmath29 for @xmath4 when @xmath39 .",
    "( we will see in the next section that the cardinality of @xmath29 must be a constant number @xmath13-almost surely . )",
    "it is expected that @xmath40 for @xmath5 @xcite ( see also @xcite for a possible counterargument to this ) .",
    "there are competing predictions for higher dimensions .",
    "the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) scenario would predict @xmath41 for @xmath1 high enough , and the droplet / scaling proposal would be consistent with @xmath40 in every dimension .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion on ground states of disordered systems or pure states at positive temperature .",
    "there have been several works on ground states of the ea model in the physics and mathematics literature ; a partial list includes @xcite .",
    "the present work appears to give the first rigorous result about the entire set of ground states @xmath29 .",
    "previous rigorous results have focused on the so - called _ metastates on ground states_. a metastate is a @xmath27-dependent probability measure on @xmath42 supported on ground states .",
    "it is constructed using a sequence of finite graphs @xmath43 converging to @xmath26 . for a given realization @xmath27 and @xmath44 ,",
    "the ground state on @xmath43 is unique up to a global flip .",
    "we identify the flip - related configurations and write @xmath45 for them .",
    "a metastate is obtained by considering a converging subsequence of the measures @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the delta measure on the ground state of @xmath43 for the coupling realization @xmath27 . if @xmath48 denotes a subsequential limiting measure , then sampling from @xmath48 gives a pair @xmath49 .",
    "a metastate is the conditional measure @xmath48 given @xmath27 and is denoted @xmath50 .",
    "it is not hard to verify that @xmath50 is supported on @xmath29 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the ground state of the ea model on the half - plane with horizontal periodic boundary conditions and free boundary condition at the bottom is unique in the metastate sense . precisely , for a sequence of boxes @xmath43 that converges to the half - plane , the limit @xmath50 produced by the metastate construction is unique and is given by a delta measure on two flip - related ground states .",
    "though the metastate construction is very natural , it is important to stress that the measure thus obtained is not necessarily supported on the whole set @xmath29 . it may be that some elements of @xmath29 do not appear in the support of the metastate , due to the choice of boundary conditions on @xmath43 or to the fact that the subsequence in the metastate construction is chosen independently of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore uniqueness in the metastate sense does not answer the more general question of the number of ground states .",
    "it is natural from a statistical physics perspective to study the set @xmath29 by looking at probability measures on it .",
    "one challenge is to construct probability measures on @xmath29 that have a nice dependence on @xmath27 , namely measurability and translation covariance .",
    "the metastate ( with suitably chosen boundary conditions ) briefly described above is one such measure .",
    "the main idea of the present paper is to consider another measure , the _ uniform measure on @xmath29 _",
    "@xmath51 for @xmath52 to be well - defined it is necessary to assume that @xmath33 is finite . like the metastate ,",
    "the uniform measure on ground states depends nicely on @xmath27 : see proposition  [ prop : mu mble ] and lemma  [ lem : covariance ] . the strategy to prove a  two - or - infinity \" result is to assume that @xmath53 and to conclude that it implies that @xmath52 is supported on two spin configurations related by a global flip ( that is , @xmath54 ) .",
    "the approach is similar to the proof of uniqueness in @xcite using the interface between ground states , though new tools need to be developed . for spin configurations @xmath37 and @xmath55 , define the _ interface _ @xmath56 as @xmath57 it will be shown for the half - plane that @xmath58 this implies that @xmath52 is supported on two flip - related configurations for @xmath13-almost all @xmath27 since @xmath59 if and only if @xmath60 or @xmath61 .    before going into the details of the proofs , we remark that the problem of determining the number of ground states for the ea model can be seen as a spin - glass version of a first - passage percolation problem .",
    "indeed , one question in two - dimensional first - passage percolation is to determine whether there exist infinite geodesics .",
    "these are doubly - infinite curves that locally minimize the sum of the random weights between vertices of the graph .",
    "this problem is equivalent to determining whether there exist more than two flip - related ground states in the ( ferromagnetic ) ising model with random couplings .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ferromagnetic model is the same as in , but the distribution of @xmath27 is restricted to the positive half - line .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the details of the correspondence .",
    "it was proved by wehr in @xcite that the number of ground states for this model is either two or infinity in dimensions greater or equal to two . on the half - plane , it was shown by wehr and woo @xcite that the number of ground states is two .",
    "contrary to the ferromagnetic case , the study of ground states of the ea spin glass model presents technical difficulties that stem from the presence of positive and negative couplings .",
    "this feature rules out monotonicity of the partial sums of couplings along an interface .",
    "the paper is organized into two main parts as follows .",
    "the first part develops general tools to study ground states of the ea model .",
    "precisely , in section 2 , elementary properties of the set @xmath29 are derived for general graphs . in particular ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath29 on a single coupling is studied .",
    "properties of probability measures on @xmath29 are investigated in section 3 with an emphasis on the uniform measure on @xmath29 .",
    "the second part of the paper consists of the proof of theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] and is contained in section 4 . +",
    "* acknowledgements * both authors are indebted to charles newman and daniel stein for having introduced them to the subject of short - range spin glasses and for numerous discussions on related problems .",
    "arguin thanks also janek wehr for discussions on the problem of the number of ground states in spin glasses and in disordered ferromagnets .",
    "in this section , unless otherwise stated , we consider the ea model on a connected graph @xmath62 of finite degree .",
    "we assume that there exists a sequence of subgraphs @xmath63 that converges locally to @xmath26 . throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the following notation : @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the borel sigma - algebra generated by its product topology ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the corresponding product sigma - algebra .",
    "we first note that the set of ground states is compact .",
    "@xmath29 is a non - empty compact subset of @xmath68 ( in the product topology ) for all @xmath27 . in particular ,",
    "the set of probability measures on @xmath29 is compact in the weak- * topology on the set of probability measures on @xmath68 .",
    "the fact that @xmath29 is non - empty follows by a standard compactness argument , taking a subsequence of ground states for the hamiltonian with @xmath69 .",
    "the function @xmath70 is continuous in the product topology for a given finite @xmath16 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the set @xmath71 is closed .",
    "since @xmath29 is the intersection of these sets over all finite @xmath16 by , it is closed .",
    "being a closed subset of the compact space @xmath68 , it is also compact .",
    "the second statement of the lemma follows from the first .",
    "the next result is necessary for the uniform measure to be well - behaved and to later apply the ergodic theorem to @xmath33 .",
    "[ prop : mble ] the random variable @xmath72 is @xmath73-measurable .    consider a sequence of finite graphs @xmath74 , a configuration @xmath75 on @xmath76 and a configuration @xmath77 on the external boundary of @xmath76 ( that is , all vertices that are not in @xmath76 but are adjacent to vertices in it ) .",

    "taking the union over all @xmath85 and @xmath77 for a fixed @xmath83 , we get that for @xmath88 and @xmath83 fixed , the following set is measurable : @xmath89    if there exists a sequence of ( possibly @xmath27-dependent ) configurations @xmath90 such that there are ground states @xmath91 on @xmath76 with boundary condition @xmath77 that converge to @xmath37 , then @xmath37 is in @xmath29 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath30 , such a sequence @xmath91 exists by taking @xmath92 to be the restriction of @xmath37 to the boundary .",
    "it follows that @xmath93 is the event that there is an infinite - volume ground state @xmath37 for couplings @xmath27 that equals @xmath83 on @xmath84 .",
    "this event is thus measurable .",
