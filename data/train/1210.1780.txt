    "this is a review paper of the bukhgeim - klibanov method ( bk ) .",
    "the author considers this paper as an introductory material for bk . because of many publications on bk",
    ", the author restricts himself to citations of those works which he is best familiar with .",
    "an interested reader can find further citations as well as analytical details in publications cited here .",
    "three topics are discussed in this paper : ( 1 ) global uniqueness for multidimensional coefficient inverse problems ( mcips ) with single measurement data via bk , ( 2 ) global stability both for mcips and some ill - posed cauchy problems via carleman estimates , and ( 3 ) related convergent numerical methods both for mcips and some ill - posed cauchy problems .",
    "bk was introduced in three originating papers of bukhgeim and klibanov in 1981 @xcite . until now bk remains the only technique enabling to prove global uniqueness and stability theorems for mcips with single measurement data .",
    "the state of the art in the field of inverse problems in 1981 is well reflected in the following citation from the paper @xcite .",
    "_ uniqueness theorems for multidimensional inverse problems have at present been obtained mainly in classes of piecewise analytic functions and similar classes or locally ... moreover , the technique of investigating these problems has , as a rule depended in an essential way on the type of the differential equation . in this note a new method of investigating inverse problems is proposed that is based on weighted a priori estimates .",
    "this method makes it possible to consider in a unified way a broad class of inverse problems for those equations _ @xmath0 _ _  for which the solution of the cauchy problem admits a carleman estimate ... the theorems of  1 were proved by m.v .",
    "klibanov and those of  2 by a.l .",
    "they were obtained simultaneously and independently . _ _ \"    while the paper @xcite contains announcement of results and an indication of the proof , papers @xcite contain first complete proofs . also , see , e.g. bukh2,eek , kalt , klib2,klib3,klib4,klibmaxw , klib5,klibpar1,klibsurvey , klibpar2,kt , kyam , klib6 and sections 1.10 and 1.11 of the book @xcite for some follow up publications of these authors on bk .",
    "prior publications bukhklib , bukh1,klib1 only the so - called * local * uniqueness theorems were known for mcips with single measurement data .",
    "the term _ local _ means here that unknown spatially dependent coefficients were assumed to be either piecewise analytic functions , or functions represented via truncated fourier - like series , or sufficiently small perturbations of constants . at that time",
    "the common desire of many mathematicians working on mcips was to prove * global * uniqueness theorems .",
    "that is , to prove uniqueness for the case when the unknown coefficient @xmath1 satisfies only some natural conditions , such as , e.g. @xmath2 .",
    "however , it was unclear at that time how to do this .",
    "indeed , standard methods were basically based on integral equations and did not work for this goal .",
    "the absence of global uniqueness theorems was the main stumbling block in the field of inverse problems in 1970s .",
    "this is what has originally motivated the author in 1979 to think about moving away from traditional techniques .",
    "the author has spent two years to figure out the solution .",
    "this paper is focused only on mcips with single measurement data .",
    "bk is based on a special use of carleman estimates for mcips . roughly speaking ,",
    "as soon as carleman estimate is valid for a pde operator , bk can be applied .",
    "therefore , the generality of bk is due to the fact that carleman estimates are valid for hyperbolic , parabolic , elliptic , the non - stationary schrdinger and some other operators . schematically , bk consists of the following two steps :    * step 1*. given an mcip , figure out whether a proper carleman estimate is valid for the pde operator of this problem . if not , derive a proper carleman estimate ( if possible ) .",
    "* step 2*. given a proper carleman estimate , apply bk .",
    "carleman estimates were originated in 1939 in a remarkable work of a distinguished swedish mathematician torsten carleman @xcite . since then and up to now",
    "they have been traditionally applied by many authors to proofs of uniqueness theorems for various ill - posed problems for pdes with the cauchy data on non - characteristic hypersurfaces , see , e.g. the paper of calderon @xcite and the book of hrmander @xcite .",
    "while in these references carleman estimates were used for functions with compact support , the book of lavrentev , romanov and shishatskii @xcite ( chapter 4 ) uses functions with non - compact support .  as a result ,",
    "the technique of this book allowed to prove not only uniqueness but hlder stability results as well for some ill - posed cauchy problems .",
    "thus , it was briefly noticed in earlier publications @xcite with the reference to @xcite that the applicability of bk to an mcip usually automatically implies the hlder stability estimate for this mcip . since the author is concerned with mcips , multiple quite interesting works on applications of carleman estimates to various ill - posed cauchy problems are not cited here .",
    "bk applies carleman estimates , in a specially designed way , to proofs of global uniqueness and stability results for mcips .",
    "mcips are substantially different from those cauchy problems .",
    "indeed , in such a cauchy problem all coefficients of the corresponding pde operator are known , the initial condition is unknown , and the cauchy data at a non - characteristic hypersurface are known .",
    "it is required then to reconstruct the solution @xmath3 of the corresponding pde . on the other hand , in an mcip at least one of coefficients ,",
    "@xmath4 of the corresponding pde operator is unknown , the initial condition is known , and the lateral cauchy data are known as well .",
    "it is required then to reconstruct the pair of functions @xmath5 those cauchy problem are linear and any mcip is nonlinear .",
    "the term mcip with single measurement data \" means the problem of the recovery of one of coefficients of a pde from a boundary measurement generated by a single set of initial conditions . in the case of either the point source or a plane wave",
    "this means either a single position of that source or a single direction of that incident plane wave .",
    "more generally , this is a single pair of initial conditions for a hyperbolic pde and a single initial condition for a parabolic pde .",
    "sometimes a few initial sets of initial conditions are allowed . in the case",
    "when @xmath6 coefficients are unknown , @xmath6 sets of initial conditions are allowed , which means @xmath6 measurements .",
    "mcips with single measurement are non - overdetermined ones .",
    "the non - overdetermination means that the number of free variables in the data equals the number of free variables in the unknown coefficient .",
    "the single measurement case is the one with the minimal amount of the available information .",
    "hence , this is the most economical way of data collection . in particular , in military applications the single measurement case is far preferable to the case of many measurements .",
    "this is because an installation of each source carries a serious risk for life of soldiers on a battlefield .",
    "there is a single condition of bk , which has been viewed as a drawback from the applied standpoint for a long time since 1981 , this condition is still not lifted .",
    "specifically , bk requires that at least one initial condition to be non - zero in the entire domain of interest .",
    "however , after getting an extensive recent numerical experience with the approximately globally convergent numerical method for mcips ( see the book of beilina and klibanov @xcite and section 6 below ) , the author believes now that this drawback is an absolutely insignificant one precisely _ _",
    "_ _ from the applied standpoint ( although the mathematical question remains open )",
    ". indeed , the most interesting case in applications is the case when the initial condition is the function @xmath7 with a fixed position of the source @xmath8 however , replacement of this function by its approximation via a narrow gaussian @xmath9 @xmath10immediately lets bk working ( @xmath11 is sufficiently small here ) .",
    "the corresponding boundary data , which model the data resulting from a measurement , have only an insignificant change .  therefore , if a numerical method for a corresponding mcip is stable , as it must be , then this change should affect the solution only insignificantly .",
    "furthermore , physicists and engineers are indifferent to such a replacement because of the above reasons .",
    "this is why functions @xmath7  and @xmath12  are equivalent precisely from the applied standpoint .",
    "still , the author has proved @xcite uniqueness theorem for an mcip for the equation @xmath13 for the case of an incident plane wave with @xmath14 and under the assumption that this equation for the function @xmath3 is written in finite differences with respect to @xmath15    the idea of bk is described in section 3 .",
    "five examples of this section show how bk works . in a less general form examples of sections 3.2 , 3.3.2 and 3.4",
    "were first published in originating works @xcite , also see @xcite for more general forms of these three examples as well as for two other examples of section 3 . in principle , it is possible to formulate bk in a general abstract form , see , e.g. the earlier paper of the author @xcite for this form . however , it is not necessary to do so for the understanding of bk .",
    "previously published relevant results are discussed in section 4 as well as in the end of each of sections 2,3,5,6 .",
    "we now introduce the notion of the pointwise carleman estimate for a general partial differential operator of the second order .",

    "that @xmath1115set in ( [ 5.14 ] ) @xmath1116 and use ( 5.35 ) and ( [ 5.36 ] )",
    ". then we obtain the following dirichlet boundary value problem for the function @xmath1117 @xmath1118where @xmath1119 is the exact function @xmath1120 which corresponds to the function @xmath1121 the approximate equation ( [ 5.37 ] ) is valid only within the framework of assumption 6.1 .",
    "although this equation is linear , formula ( [ 5.16 ] ) for the reconstruction of the target coefficient @xmath1122 is nonlinear .    assuming that the function @xmath1123 consider the solution @xmath588 of the following boundary value problem @xmath1124we choose the first tail function as @xmath1125by the schauder theorem there exists unique solution @xmath606 of the problem ( 5.40 ) , ( [ 5.41 ] ) , see the book of ladyzhenskaya and uralceva @xcite for schauder theorem .",
    "furthermore , it follows from schauder theorem as well as from ( [ 5.37])-([5.43 ] ) that with a number @xmath1126 the following estimate holds @xmath1127    therefore , our main approximations are ( [ 5.35 ] ) and ( [ 5.351 ] ) . _ _  _ _ these approximations mean the truncation of the term @xmath1128 in ( [ 5.300 ] ) . the goal of ( [ 5.35 ] ) and ( [ 5.36 ] ) is to obtain the accuracy estimate ( [ 5.42 ] ) for the first tail .",
    "we point out that these approximations are done only on the first iteration of our method .",
    "it follows from ( [ 5.42 ] ) that we obtain an approximation located in a small neighborhood of the exact solution already on the first iteration of our method , as long as the error in the boundary data @xmath1129 is small .",
    "convergence theorem 2.9.4 of bk and theorem 5.1 of @xcite guarantee that all other solutions obtained in the iterative process also provide good approximations , as long as the number of iterations is not too large .",
    "this means that we should develop a stopping criterion numerically .",
    "the latter was done in above cited publications about this method .",
    "recall that the main point _ _  _ _ of any locally convergent numerical method is to get a good first guess about the solution . and",
    "this is exactly what our approximately globally convergent method delivers .",
    "hence , we can apply the second stage of our two - stage numerical procedure to refine the solution @xcite .",
    "more precisely , a locally convergent adaptive finite element method ( adaptivity ) was applied .",
    "a good numerical performance of this two - stage numerical procedure was demonstrated in @xcite , including the most challenging case of experimental data @xcite .",
    "the adaptivity takes the solution obtained on the globally convergent stage as the first guess for further iterations .",
    "suppose now that iterations of the first stage are stopped prior that stopping criterion is in place .",
    "then the adaptivity still refines the solution quite well . for example , in tests 2 and 3 on page 278 of @xcite adaptivity has started from functions @xmath1130 for those @xmath1131 which were smaller than the number @xmath1132 where the stopping criterion was achieved .",
    "nevertheless , images of these tests were quite accurate ones .",
    "furthermore , this two - stage numerical procedure led to accurate images from experimental data , see @xcite  and chapter 5 of @xcite . as to some other works on the adaptivity technique , see , e.g. beilina @xcite and li , xie and zou @xcite .      in parallel with the above approximately globally convergent method ,",
    "another one was developed by the group of researchers from university of texas at arlington in collaboration with the author , see klibanov , su , pantong , shan and liu @xcite , pantong , su , shan , klibanov and liu @xcite , shan , klibanov , su , pantong and liu @xcite , su , shan , liu and klibanov @xcite and su , klibanov , liu , lin , pantong and liu @xcite . a globally accelerated numerical method for optical tomography with continuous wave source in this case the 2d mcip for the elliptic equation@xmath1133was considered",
    "let @xmath1134 be a straight line .",
    "the mcip consists in the determination of the unknown coefficient @xmath1028 for @xmath1135 in ( [ 5.50 ] ) from the function @xmath1136 this is the problem of the so - called optical diffusion tomography with a direct application in optical imaging of strokes in brains . in this case",
    "@xmath510 is the position of the light source , @xmath1137 is the light intensity and the function @xmath1028 is proportional to the absorption coefficient of light .",
    "the most important difference between this problem and the one discussed in section 6.1 is that the asymptotic behavior of tails like the one in ( [ 5.13 ] ) is not the case here .",
    "thus , tails are treated quite differently in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "accurate images from experimental data for a phantom medium were obtained .    in works of bikowski ,",
