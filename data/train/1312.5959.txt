    "much attention has been given recently to the convergence of large random planar maps viewed as metric spaces to the continuous random metric space known as the brownian map .",
    "see in particular @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to provide another interesting example of these limit theorems , in the case of bipartite planar maps with a fixed number of edges .",
    "recall that a planar map is a proper embedding of a finite connected graph in the two - dimensional sphere , viewed up to orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the sphere .",
    "the faces of the map are the connected components of the complement of edges .",
    "the degree of a face is the number of edges incident to it , with the convention that , if both sides of an edge are incident to the same face , then this edge is counted twice in the degree of the face .",
    "a planar map is rooted if there is a distinguished oriented edge , which is called the root edge .",
    "we consider only bipartite planar maps in the present work .",
    "a planar map is bipartite if its vertices can be colored with two colors , in such a way that two vertices that have the same color are not connected by an edge ( in particular , there are no loops ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the property that all faces of the map have an even degree .",
    "if @xmath4 is a planar map , the vertex set of @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 , and the usual graph distance on @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 stand for the set of all rooted bipartite maps with @xmath2 edges .",
    "[ cvgcarte ] for every @xmath0 , let @xmath1 be uniformly distributed over @xmath7",
    ". then , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the brownian map .",
    "the convergence holds in distribution in the space @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the set of all isometry classes of compact metric spaces and @xmath12 is the gromov - hausdorff distance .",
    "a brief presentation of the brownian map will be given in section [ cvgcarte ] below .",
    "see @xcite and the references therein for more information about this random compact metric space .    as mentioned above ,",
    "several limit theorems analogous to theorem [ cvgcarte ] have been proved for other classes of random planar maps .",
    "the case of @xmath13-angulations , which are planar maps where all faces have the same degree @xmath13 , has received particular attention .",
    "le gall @xcite proved the convergence in distribution of rescaled @xmath13-angulations with a fixed number of faces to the brownian map , both when @xmath14 ( triangulations ) and when @xmath15 is even .",
    "the case of quadrangulations ( @xmath16 ) has been treated independently by miermont @xcite .",
    "more recently , similar results have been obtained for random planar maps with local constraints : beltran and le gall @xcite proved the convergence to the brownian map for quadrangulations with no pendant vertices , and addario - berry and albenque @xcite discussed similar results for simple triangulations or quadrangulations , where there are no loops or multiple edges .",
    "all these papers however deal with random planar maps conditioned to have a fixed number of faces . in our setting , it would make no sense to consider the uniform distribution over all bipartite planar maps with a given number of faces , since there are infinitely many such planar maps .",
    "similarly it would make no sense to condition on the number of vertices , and for this reason we consider conditioning on the number of edges , which results in certain additional technical difficulties .    in order to prove theorem [ cvgcarte ] ,",
    "we first establish a similar result for planar maps that are both rooted and pointed ( this means that , in addition to the root edge there is a distinguished vertex , which we call the origin of the map ) .",
    "as in several of the previously mentioned papers , the proof of this result relies on the combinatorial bijections of bouttier , di francesco and guitter @xcite between ( rooted and pointed ) bipartite planar maps and certain labeled two - type plane trees .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the set of all rooted and pointed planar bipartite maps with @xmath2 edges , and let @xmath18 be uniformly distributed over @xmath17 .",
    "the random tree associated with @xmath18 via the bouttier , di francesco , guitter bijection is identified as a ( labeled ) two - type galton - watson tree with explicit offspring distributions , conditioned to have a fixed total progeny ( see proposition [ loiarbre ] below ) . in order to prove the convergence to the brownian map ,",
    "an important technical step is then to derive asymptotics for the contour and label functions associated with this conditioned tree ( theorem [ cvgcontourlabel ] ) .",
    "such asymptotics for conditioned two - type galton - watson trees have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however both these papers consider conditioning on the number of vertices of one type , which makes it easier to derive the desired asymptotics from the case of usual ( one - type ) galton - watson trees .",
    "the fact that we are here conditioning on the total number of vertices creates a significant additional difficulty , which we handle through an absolute continuity argument similar to the ones used in section 6 of @xcite .",
    "a useful technical ingredient is a seemingly new definition of a `` modified '' lukasievicz path associated with a two - type tree , which might be of independent interest .",
    "this new definition is somehow related to a bijection of janson and stefnsson @xcite between one - type and two - type trees .    as we were finishing the first version of the present article , we learnt of the very recent paper @xcite , which obtains a result similar to ours for _ general _ planar maps .",
    "the arguments of @xcite might also be applicable to the bipartite case , but the methods seem quite different from the ones that are presented here .",
    "we finally note the simple scaling constant @xmath19 in theorem [ cvgcarte ] . as far as we know",
    ", this value is different from the ones already computed for other classes of maps .",
    "the analogous constant for uniform general maps with @xmath2 edges @xcite is @xmath20 and the one for uniform quadrangulations with @xmath2 edges ( @xmath2 even ) @xcite is @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces our main notation and definitions , and recalls the key bijection of @xcite between rooted and pointed bipartite maps and labeled two - type trees . in section 3 , we identify the distribution of the random two - type tree associated to a map uniformly distributed over @xmath22 , and we introduce its `` modified '' lukasievicz path .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the asymptotics of the contour and label functions coding the two - type tree .",
    "section 5 gives the proof of the statement analogous to theorem [ cvgcarte ] for rooted and pointed maps .",
    "finally , section 6 explains how to derive theorem [ cvgcarte ] from the latter statement .",

    "we note that every @xmath113 corresponds to exactly one corner of the vertex @xmath114 ( if we move around the tree in clockwise order , the successive white vertices that are visited are @xmath115 and each visit but the last one corresponds to a new corner ) , and we will abuse terminology by calling this corner the corner @xmath114 .",
    "we then add an extra vertex @xmath116 outside the tree @xmath38 , and we construct a planar map @xmath117 , whose vertex set is the union of @xmath106 and of the extra vertex @xmath116 , as follows : for every @xmath118 ,    * if @xmath119 , then we draw an edge of @xmath117 between the corner @xmath114 and @xmath116 ; * if @xmath120 , then we draw an edge of @xmath117 between the corner @xmath114 and the corner @xmath121 , where @xmath122 if @xmath123 is nonempty , @xmath124 otherwise .",
    "thanks to property ( ii ) of the labels , it is possible to achieve this construction in such a way that edges do not intersect ( except at their ends ) and do not cross the edges of the tree .",
    "the collection of all edges drawn in the preceding construction gives a bipartite planar map @xmath117 with @xmath2 edges .",

    "in this section , we derive theorem [ cvgcarte ] from the convergence for rooted and pointed maps . notice that similar arguments appear in ( * ? ? ? * proposition 4 ) .",
    "as previously , @xmath18 is uniformly distributed over @xmath22 , but it will be sometimes be convenient to view @xmath18 as a random element of @xmath546 , just by `` forgetting '' the distinguished vertex .",
    "in particular , if @xmath547 is a function on @xmath546 , the notation @xmath548 means that we apply @xmath547 to the rooted map obtained by forgetting the distinguished vertex of @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , we will write @xmath549 for the law of @xmath18 viewed as a random element of @xmath546 . the notation @xmath550 will then stand for the law of @xmath1 , that is , the uniform probability measure on @xmath551 .",
    "let @xmath552 stand for the total variation norm . in order to get theorem [ cvgcarte ] from , it is sufficient to prove the following result .",
    "we have @xmath554 where the supremum is over all functions @xmath555 $ ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath556 can be expressed in terms of @xmath557 as @xmath558 which implies @xmath559 we then need an estimate of @xmath560 , which is given by the next lemma .",
    "we start by observing that the number @xmath564 corresponds via the bdg bijection to ( @xmath291 plus ) the number of white vertices of a two - type galton - watson tree with offspring distributions @xmath70 given by proposition [ loiarbre ] , conditioned to have @xmath2 edges .",
    "let us consider a sequence of independent two - type galton - watson trees with offspring distributions @xmath70 .",
    "suppose that the white vertices of these trees are listed in lexicographical order for each tree , one tree after another , and write @xmath565 for the respective numbers of black children of the white vertices in this enumeration .",
    "then @xmath566 are i.i.d random variables with distribution @xmath73 , and we recall that @xmath73 is a geometric distribution with mean @xmath528",
    ". we can apply cramer s theorem to get the exponential bound , for every @xmath0 , @xmath567 where @xmath344 is a positive constant .",
    "let @xmath157 and @xmath158 be respectively the numbers of white and black vertices in the first tree in our sequence , and let @xmath568 , which is the number of edges of this tree .",
    "the point now is the fact that if we condition on the event @xmath418 , the planar map associated with the first tree becomes uniform on @xmath22 .",
    "since this planar map has @xmath569 vertices , the result of the lemma will follow if we can prove that , for @xmath2 sufficiently large , @xmath570\\leq \\exp(-c_\\delta n)\\ ] ] for some positive constant @xmath571 .",
    "recall from that @xmath572 as @xmath275 .",
    "therefore the preceding exponential bound will follow if we can verify that for all @xmath2 large enough , @xmath573\\leq \\exp(-c_\\delta n)\\ ] ] with some positive constant @xmath574 .",
    "we first observe that the event @xmath575 is contained in @xmath576 therefore if we set @xmath577 , the event @xmath578 may only hold if , for some @xmath146 such that @xmath579 , the first @xmath146 white vertices of our sequence of trees have less than @xmath580 black children .",
    "using , we obtain that @xmath581 for some positive constants @xmath582 and @xmath583 .",
    "similar arguments give an analogous exponential bound for the probability of the event @xmath584 .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "first , as @xmath588 , we have @xmath589 .",
    "let @xmath590 .",
    "the event @xmath591 is contained in @xmath592 .",
    "this leads to @xmath593 hence , by lemma [ majoexpo ] , @xmath594 and the desired result follows since @xmath345 was arbitrary .",
