    "several authors have proposed that the ground state of matter is in the form of bulk quark matter made of the three flavors , up , down and strange .",
    "we adopt the term strange matter ( sm ) to refer to this bulk quark matter .",
    "conversion of nuclear matter to sm is suppressed at ordinary nuclear densities . at very large nuclear densities like those in neutron stars , where the fermi energy is higher than the strange quark mass , the conversion however is possible .",
    "this has led to conjecture that _ strange stars _ that are predominantly made of sm may form by conversion of neutrons in dense neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the conversion is assumed to be triggered at the center of the neutron star ( where the density is highest ) either by presence of a seed sm or by spontaneous @xmath0 -hyperons .",
    "strange stars fall in a mass range similar to that of neutron stars , but they have smaller radii@xcite .",
    "there is mounting , albeit controversial , observational evidence for the existence of strange stars .",
    "likely candidates are the the compact objects 3c58 and rx j1856.5 - 3754@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of transition into sm has not yet been examined in details . according to   @xcite ,",
    "the transition is realized by outward diffusion of strange quarks .",
    "the increased fraction of sm as a result of diffusion triggers further conversion into sm . in this case",
    "the conversion may be described as slow combustion at speeds of about @xmath1 .",
    "however , stability analysis in the presence of gravity has shown that this combustion process is unstable to small perturbations  @xcite .",
    "once these perturbation grow they increase the effective area available for diffusion .",
    "therefore the conversion may actually propagate in the form of detonation sustained by the enhanced `` burning '' . in the simplest variant ,",
    "the detonation wave ( dw ) is propagating into a neutron matter nm with constant density .",
    "newtonian gravity was used in  @xcite to determine the parameters of the resultant strange star and to estimate the energy released in the process .",
    "more realistic models for the propagation of dws should take into account a varying density of nm .",
    "further , next to black holes , neutron stars have the largest gravitational fields in nature .",
    "moreover , the characteristic time of gravitational processes @xmath2 is comparable to the hydrodynamical time scale @xmath3s@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is prudent to consider detonation in the context of general relativistic hydrodynamics . in this paper",
    "we study self - similar models of dw propagation in non - uniform nm , taking into account a self - consistent treatment of gravity according to general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "we consider detonation in static and collapsing backgrounds of nm .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in ",
    "2 we write the equation of state for quark matter . in",
    " 3.1 we present the equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics in the absence of gravitation .",
    "self - similar solutions in this case are presented in  3.2 for uniform and non - uniform backgrounds of nm .",
    "we turn to the general relativistic description in  4 where we derive the equations for general relativistic hydrodynamics and present the corresponding numerical self - similar solutions for static and collapsing non - uniform background . in ",
    "5 we conclude with a discussion of the results and their implications .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) for hot ( quark ) matter has the form of simple relation  @xcite , @xmath4 we use throughout @xmath5 and @xmath6 to denote the energy density and the pressure , respectively .",
    "this simple eos may be obtained straightforward from the next eos  @xcite @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 is the temperature , @xmath10 is the baryon number density , @xmath11 is the chemical potential of quark matter , @xmath12 is the mit bag constant .",
    "the sound speed in such matter is defined as @xmath13 , where the derivation occurs at constant entropy .",
    "it is easy to see that the sound speed remains constant @xmath14 .",
    "the eos [ eos3 ] was used by witten for calculation of the structure of strange stars  @xcite .",
    "we shall adopt this simple approximation for modelling of detonation transition of neutron stars into strange one .",
    "first , we describe the propagation of detonation without taking into account the effects of gravity . this will be useful for comparison of our results with the existing literature and will also facilitate the interpretation of the general relativistic solutions to be presented in  [ gr ] .",
    "the neglect of gravity is justified if the detonation time scale is smaller than the dynamical time scale .",
    "gravitational effects become important after the end of detonation , but in this section we will only be concerned with describing the detonation phase .",
    "here we describe the relevant equations for detonation in special relativistic hydrodynamics ( srh ) .",
    "we assume that the pressure of nm is negligible compared to its energy density , @xmath15 otherwise there will not be any significant gain in pressure in the transition from nm to sm .",
    "we will also assume throughout the energy density of the sm @xmath16 behind the front is substantially larger than the  vacuum energy ",
    "@xmath17 which is close to nuclear energy density of usual matter , @xmath18 under the conditions([epn])-([eps ] ) we express these eoss as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to hot relativistic matter and cold neutron matter , respectively .",
    "values other than @xmath21 can be used to describe approximately the eos of the nm , in these cases @xmath22 can be regarded representing the square of an `` effective '' sound speed for the nm",
    ".    we will base our description of detonation in srh on an analogy with the classical theory of detonation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , instead of using covariant notation we express the relevant equations in terms of the radial component of the 3-velocity @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a radial coordinate and @xmath25 is the time measured in units of lengths .",
    "we use the notation @xmath26 for the `` enthalpy ''",
    ".    the relevant equations of srh are , @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "+ the first of these equations is the euler equation and the second is the continuity equation for energy density .",
    "these equations determine the evolution of the system in which a detonation front propagates outward from the center of the neutron star converting its into sm . in a frame of reference moving with the front ,",
    "a requirement of the energy - momentum flow be conserved yields the following jump conditions at the front @xmath29 in addition , there is baryon flux conservation @xmath22 @xmath30 here the indexes @xmath31 designate the quantities concerning to nm and to sm , respectively .",
    "so , @xmath32 is the velocity of  inflow \" of neutron matter in front of dw and @xmath33 is the departure velocity of sm from the front .",
    "if the 3-velocity @xmath34 in ( [ cond ] ) is measured in the local frame of detonation front then , according to the relativistic equation of velocity transformation , in the laboratory local frame it takes the value    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the speed of dw in this frame .",
    "the classical analysis of detonation conditions leads to definition of a normal detonation condition when the speed of hot fluid corresponds to sound speed @xmath37  @xcite . in the case of nm at rest @xmath38 and substituting ( [ en ] ) in the jump conditions ( [ cond ] ) yields",
    "@xmath39      let the detonation wave propagate in cold nm background ( @xmath40 according to([epn ] ) ) , and let the sm behind the front be hot and relativistic ( see ( [ eps ] ) ) .",

    ", we find the self - similar solutions assuming the velocity @xmath41 to depend on @xmath24 and @xmath42 only through the variable @xmath43    analysis of the system ( [ eorh ] ) shows that self - similar solutions can be obtained in the case of power dependence of density of nm , @xmath44 this distribution of nm can be created by its own gravity ( newtonian gravitation ) .",
