    "quiver mutation is a central element in the recent theory of cluster algebras introduced by fomin and zelevinsky in @xcite .",
    "it is an elementary operation on quivers which generates an equivalence relation .",
    "the mutation class of a quiver @xmath2 is the class of all quivers which are mutation equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "the mutation class of quivers of type @xmath3 is the class containing all quivers mutation equivalent to a quiver whose underlying graph is the dynkin diagram of type @xmath3 , shown in figure  [ fig : dynkin]@xmath4 .",
    "the quivers in the mutation class were characterized by buan and vatne in  @xcite . the corresponding task for type @xmath1 , shown in figure  [ fig : dynkin]@xmath5 ,",
    "was accomplished by vatne in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an explicit formula for the number of quivers in the mutation class of type @xmath3 was given by torkildsen in  @xcite and of type @xmath1 by buan and torkildsen in @xcite .",
    "in this article , we consider quivers of type @xmath6 .",
    "that is , all quivers mutation equivalent to a quiver whose underlying graph is the extended dynkin diagram of type @xmath6 , i.e. , the @xmath7-cycle see figure  [ fig : dynkin]@xmath8 .",
    "if this cycle is oriented , then we get the mutation class of @xmath1 , see fomin et al .  in @xcite and type iv in @xcite .",
    "if the cycle is non - oriented , we get the mutation classes of @xmath6 , studied by the first named author in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an explicit formula for the number of quivers in the mutation classes of quivers of type @xmath6 .",
    "since a cluster - tilted algebra @xmath9 of type @xmath6 is finite dimensional over an algebraically closed field @xmath10 , there exists a quiver @xmath2 which is in the mutation classes of @xmath6 ( see for instance assem et al .  in @xcite ) and an admissible ideal i of the path algebra @xmath11 of @xmath2 such that @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we also obtain the number of non - isomorphic cluster - tilted algebras of type @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , we prove a more refined counting theorem .",
    "namely , one can classify these algebras up to derived equivalence , see @xcite .",
    "each equivalence class is determined by four parameters , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( up to interchanging @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , where @xmath17 . given positive integers @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 , the set of equivalence classes with @xmath21 and @xmath22 corresponds to one mutation class of quivers .",
    "the number of cluster - tilted algebras in the derived equivalence classes with parameters @xmath23 and @xmath16 is given by @xmath24 if @xmath25 or @xmath26 , and @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "( here @xmath30 is euler s totient function , i.e. , the number of @xmath31 coprime to @xmath32 . )    in particular , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we obtain the number @xmath35 of quivers mutation equivalent to a non - oriented @xmath7-cycle with @xmath18 arrows oriented in one direction and @xmath19 arrows oriented in the other direction : @xmath36        the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : pres ] we collect some basic notions about quiver mutation .",
    "furthermore , we present the classification of quivers of type @xmath6 according to the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 mentioned above , as given in @xcite . in section  [ sec : comb - gramm ] we restate the classification as a combinatorial grammar . using generatingfunctionology  we obtain the formulae for the assymmetric case where @xmath25 or @xmath26 . for the case @xmath28 and @xmath29 some additional combinatorial considerations , counting the number of quivers invariant under reflection , yield the result stated above .    the formulae for @xmath35 are developed in parallel .",
    "in fact , it is remarkable that the generating function including variables for the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath16 can be obtained by _ specialising _ the much simpler generating function having variables for the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 only .",
    "moreover , extracting the coefficient of @xmath41 in a naive way from the equations obtained from combinatorial grammars results in a much uglier five - fold sum , instead of the three - fold sum stated in the main theorem .",
    "finally , at the end of section  [ sec : comb - gramm ] we prove the formula for the number of quivers in the mutation class of type @xmath1 , by exhibiting an appropriate bijection between these and a subclass of the objects counted in section  [ sec : number - quivers ] .",
    "* acknowledgements : * we would like to thank thorsten holm for invaluable comments on a preliminary version of this article , and ira gessel for providing the beautiful proof of lemma  [ lem : gessel ] .",
    "we also would like to thank christian krattenthaler who gave an elementary proof of the same lemma , of which at first we only had a computer assisted proof .            1 .   a quiver in @xmath1 of type @xmath42 , where precisely one of the two distinguished arrows incident to the root is oriented towards it , or 2 .   a quiver in @xmath1 of type @xmath43 , i.e. , a quiver having a unique oriented @xmath46-cycle",
    "it remains to describe the bijection in the case where the main cycle of @xmath44 is a loop . in a first step ,",
    "we delete the vertex of this loop and all arrows incident to it , to obtain a rooted quiver @xmath47 of type @xmath48 .",
    "for the second and final step , we distinguish two cases :    1 .",
    "the root of @xmath49 is incident to a single arrow @xmath50 . in this case",
    "we obtain a quiver @xmath2 in @xmath1 of type @xmath42 by adding a second arrow , oriented in the same way as @xmath50 , to the other vertex @xmath50 is incident to",
    ". 2 .   on the other hand , consider the case that the root of @xmath49 is incident to an oriented @xmath51-cycle @xmath52 .",
    "then , we glue a second @xmath51-cycle , oriented in the same way as @xmath52 , along the arrow of @xmath52 opposite to the root . in this way",
    "we create a quiver in @xmath1 of type @xmath53 .      * a quiver @xmath2 in @xmath1 of type @xmath42 has a uniquely determined root , and two distinguished arrows incident to it .",
    "if they are oriented in opposite directions , then the main cycle in the preimage of the transformation is an oriented @xmath45-cycle . otherwise , the preimage is a loop .",
    "* @xmath2 is of type @xmath53 , if and only if it has two oriented @xmath51-cycles sharing an arrow . * finally , @xmath2 is of type @xmath43 , if and only if it has a unique oriented @xmath46-cycle .",
