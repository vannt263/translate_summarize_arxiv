    "one of the methods for analyzing flux - line pinning in high-@xmath8 superconductor thin platelets is the measuring of magnetic - field profiles at the upper surface of these superconductors when they are placed in a perpendicular external magnetic field ; see , e.g. , the recent review @xcite and references therein .",
    "these profiles enable one to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the sheet currents @xmath9 flowing in the sample @xcite ( the sheet current @xmath9 is the current density integrated over the thickness of the sample ) , and hence to extract some information on the critical currents in the superconductor.@xcite the magnetic - field profiles are measured either with magneto - optical imaging , @xcite@xmath10@xcite or with hall - sensor arrays.@xcite it is clear that the investigation of the profiles not only in a perpendicular but also in an oblique magnetic field could , in principle , provide additional information on vortex pinning in thin flat superconductors .    in this paper , to explain the main ideas",

    "a constant and homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath0 is applied in the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane at an angle @xmath17 to the @xmath16 axis ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "we also assume that there is no surface pinning , the thickness of the strip , @xmath21 , exceeds the london penetration depth , and the lower critical field @xmath22 is sufficiently small so that we may put for the magnetic induction @xmath23 .    in our recent paper ,",
    "@xcite a superconducting strip in an oblique magnetic field was analyzed in the framework of the bean model ( when the bulk critical current density @xmath1 is _ independent _ of the local magnetic induction @xmath2 ) , and several interesting properties of the critical state for such `` nonsymmetric '' directions of @xmath0 were established . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the final critical state depends on how the applied magnetic field is switched on , e.g. , at a constant tilt angle @xmath17 , or first its @xmath16 and then its @xmath15 component , or vise versa .",
    "however , differences between these three critical states occur only in the central region of the strip where a flux - free core exists , i.e. , where @xmath5 at the surface of the strip is practically zero",
    ". moreover , to leading order in the small parameter @xmath24 , for all the scenarios the sheet current @xmath25 is the same in this region of the sample , and it coincides with the sheet current at @xmath26 . in the region of the strip where @xmath27 , the sheet current is equal to its critical value @xmath28 and is also independent of @xmath6 and of how @xmath0 is switched on .",
    "thus , when the bean model holds , the magnetic - field profiles depend only on @xmath29 , the differences between the states do not manifest themselves in the profiles , @xcite and hence measurements of the @xmath30 profiles in inclined magnetic fields do not provide new information on flux - line pinning . in this case , to find @xmath1 , it is sufficient to extract the critical sheet current @xmath4 from the @xmath30 profiles at @xmath26 in the region with a nonzero @xmath30 and to use the relationship @xmath31 .    however , when the critical current density @xmath1 depends on @xmath32 , e.g. , on @xmath33 or on the angle between the local direction of @xmath2 and the @xmath16 axis or on both , the situation is different . in this case",

    "the problem arises how to determine @xmath7 from the magnetic - field profiles . in the present paper",
    "we address just this problem . as it was shown in ref .",
    "( see also below ) , at _ any _ dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath2 the critical state problem for a thin strip of finite thickness can be reduced to the problem of an infinitely thin strip with some effective dependence of the critical sheet current @xmath4 on the @xmath16 component of the local magnetic induction , @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the problem can be formulated as the reconstruction of @xmath7 from the measured @xmath36 .",
    "this @xmath36 depends also on the applied @xmath6 , and hence some additional information on flux line pinning can , in principle , be extracted from the @xmath30 profiles measured in an oblique magnetic field .    in this paper , to provide a basis of treating the reconstruction problem , we first consider the critical - state problem for the superconducting strip in an oblique magnetic field , without assuming any restrictions on the dependence @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath2-independent @xmath1 , critical states in such a strip depend on how the external magnetic field is switched on , not only in the region of the strip where the flux - free core occurs but also in the region penetrated by @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the profiles @xmath5 at the upper surface of the strip generally depend on @xmath6 and on how @xmath0 is switched on . as an example , in this paper we in detail analyze the case when @xmath1 depends only on the angle @xmath37 between the local direction of @xmath38 and the @xmath16 axis , @xmath39 .",
