    "fliess operators @xcite , also known as chen  fliess functional expansions , play a crucial role in the theory of nonlinear control systems @xcite .",
    "most systems found in science and engineering can be viewed as a set of simpler interconnected subsystems .",
    "ferfera was the first to describe some of the mathematical structures that result when these interconnected subsystems are modeled as fliess operators @xcite .",
    "four basic system interconnections are found in most control systems .",
    "they are known as the parallel sum , parallel product , cascade and feedback connections .",
    "( see @xcite for a review . )",
    "the first two are rather simple to describe mathematically .",
    "the third operation is equivalent to composing fliess operators . combining fliess operators through a feedback connection",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : feedback - with - v ] is also based on composition . in short ,",
    "the output of one system is fed into the input of another system , the output of which is then fed back into the input of the first .",
    "this feedback loop is , mathematically speaking , the most interesting interconnection .",
    "when one or both of the subsystems is nonlinear , the nature of the composite system can be remarkably complex . despite this , it turns out that given two nonlinear input - output systems written in terms of such chen  fliess functional expansions , it is known that the feedback interconnected system is always well defined and in the same class @xcite . an explicit formula for the generating series of a single - input , single - output ( siso ) closed - loop system was provided by two of the authors , l.  duffaut espinosa and w.s .",
    "gray , in earlier work @xcite in the context of a fa di bruno type hopf algebra .",
    "l.  foissy @xcite made a crucial contribution by showing that this hopf algebra is connected .",
    "as a result , a simple standard recursive formula could be used to calculate the antipode @xcite , which plays an important role in the analysis and design of feedback systems @xcite . in a more recent work ,",
    "the full multivariable extension of the theory as it applies to control theory is presented @xcite .",
    "an obvious but largely non - physical multivariable extension is provided in @xcite .",
    "the focus here will be on the extension in @xcite which , as will be described later , has a richer structure and more realistic properties from the point of view of proper applications in control theory .     and",
    "@xmath0    foissy s insight regarding the grading in @xcite brought into focus the combinatorial nature of the fa di bruno type hopf algebra found by l.  duffaut espinosa and w.s .",
    "however , the central coproduct was presented in terms of two recursions , which made it difficult to understand its representation as a combinatorial algebra .",
    "m.  aguiar characterized the latter in terms of a connected graded vector space with homogeneous components spanned by finite sets of combinatorial objects , and the algebraic structures are given by particular constructions on those objects . in the present work , a set of combinatorial objects",
    "is given that allows one to realize the algebraic structures of the aforementioned multivariable extension of the hopf algebra of l.  duffaut espinosa and w.s .",
    "gray in terms of combinatorial operations on those objects .",
    "the elements in this set are based on the notion of rooted circle trees on which a connected graded bialgebra is defined in terms of extractions of rooted circle subtrees .",
    "the latter can appear nested , disjoint or overlapping , which is remotely similar to the situation found in hopf algebras of feynman graphs @xcite .",
    "motivated by this analogy , a zimmermann type forest formula on rooted circle trees is given , which provides a solution of the standard recursions for the antipode .",
    "as a result , the antipode can be calculated in a way which is free of cancellations .",
    "this is of interest with respect to applications in control theory such as system inversion and output tracking , where the antipode needs to be computed explicitly to high order .",
    "thus , combinatorial efficient methods are needed for its computation .",
