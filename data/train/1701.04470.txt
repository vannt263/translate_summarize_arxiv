    "secret sharing is a basic primitive for secure information transmission @xcite .",
    "it involves a dealer who has a secret @xmath0 in the secret set @xmath1 and a set of players .",
    "the dealer divides the secret @xmath0 into @xmath2 shares and distributes shares to @xmath2 players such that if a set of players is qualified then all the players in the set can reconstruct the secret and if the set of players is not qualified then any player in the set can not obtain any information about the secret . in case of @xmath3-threshold scheme , any set of @xmath4 players can be qualified . generally , a family @xmath5 of subsets of @xmath6 is the access structure of a secret sharing protocol when any subsets in @xmath5 can reconstruct the secret @xmath0 and others can learn nothing about it .",
    "it is known that when a family @xmath5 of subset is closed with respect to the union , there exists a secret sharing protocol whose access structure is @xmath5 when the message size and the share size are sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "further , when a non - qualified set of players obtains a part of information , the protocol is called a ramp scheme secret sharing protocol @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath2 is the number of the players .",
    "@xmath7 is the number of the cheaters .",
    "@xmath4 is the number of qualified players .",
    "@xmath8 is the successful probability to identify the cheaters .",
    "efficiency shows the calculation complexity of the protocol .",
    "flexibility is the independence of the choice of the security parameter @xmath9 from the secret size or the form of original protocol .    for conventional secret sharing protocols",
    ", it is assumed that everyone involved in the protocols is honest or semi - honest .",
    "however , in a real scenario , some participants may maliciously behave in the execution of the protocol .",
    "in particular , a part of players may submit incorrect shares so as to yield an incorrect secret in the reconstruction phase . to overcome the problem , additional properties to conventional secret sharing",
    "have been considered and new schemes such as cheater - detectable secret sharing ( cdss ) @xcite and cheater - identifiable secret sharing ( ciss ) @xcite have been proposed .",
    "a protocol is called a @xmath10-cheater - detectable secret sharing ( cdss ) when it detects the existence of cheaters among players involved in reconstruction with probability @xmath11 under the condition that the number of cheaters is not greater than @xmath7 .",
    "a protocol is called a @xmath10-cheater - identifiable secret sharing ( ciss ) when it identifies who submitted incorrect shares with probability @xmath11 under the condition that the number of cheaters is not greater than @xmath7 .",
    "however , cheaters may submit their shares _",
    "after _ observing shares of honest players .",
    "such cheaters is called _ rushing _ cheaters .",
    "the papers @xcite proposed ciss protocols to properly works against such rushing cheaters . to achieve this task , their sharing phase is composed of two rounds .",
    "unfortunately , these protocols can not identify the cheaters when the number of cheaters is more than the half of players involved in reconstruction .",
    "in this situation , only the protocol in @xcite can detect the existence of cheaters without identifying them .",
    "ishai et al @xcite proposed another ciss protocol identifying them even when the number of cheaters is more than the half of players involved in reconstruction . to achieve this task",
    ", they propose a locally - identifiable secret sharing ( liss ) , in which a server identifies the cheaters instead of each player , but their liss is not robust against rushing cheaters . in their protocol , the players submit their shares to the server , and the server recovers the secret and identifies the cheaters for each player .",
    "while the server sends each player an information to identify the cheaters , this information depends on the player .",
    "that is , this information is correct only when the player is honest .",
    "hence , their identifications do not agree in this protocol .    in a real scenario ,",
    "it is not easy to prepare the server .",
    "therefore , it is strongly required to propose a protocol to identify the rushing cheaters even when more than half of the players involved in reconstruction are cheaters . in this paper , to resolve this problem , we propose the concepts of `` individual identification '' and `` agreed identification '' . a ciss protocol with _",
    "individual identification _ privately identifies the cheaters so that the identification depends on individual players . a ciss protocol with _",
    "agreed identification _ commonly identifies the cheaters so that the identification is independent of the player .",
    "the difference between these two types of protocols is based on whether their identifications agree or not .",
    "the protocol in @xcite belongs to the former , and the protocols in @xcite do to the latter .",
    "however , we do not need to distinguish cdss protocols in this way because there is no advantage even when a cdss protocol individually detects the existence of the cheaters .",
    "we propose a ciss protocol with individual identification as well as a ciss protocol with agreed identification .",
    "both protocols well work even with rushing cheaters , and the latter is composed of two rounds as well as the protocol in @xcite .",
    "the former can identify the cheaters even when more than half of the players involved in reconstruction are cheaters .",
    "the latter can detect the existence of the cheaters under the same situation , but can identify the cheaters only when less than half of the players in reconstruction are cheaters . when less than half of the players involved in reconstruction are cheaters , even the latter can identify the cheaters .",
    "this performance is the same as the protocol given in @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss the construction of protocols .",
    "algebraic structures underlie many ciss protocols @xcite as in the original construction by shamir .",
    "they are limited to @xmath3-threshold scheme protocols .",
    "however , in the community of information theory , so many efficient secret sharing protocols were proposed when the size of secret is large @xcite .",
    "protocols with general access structure were constructed @xcite .",
    "also , ramp scheme secret sharing protocols were constructed @xcite .",
    "such general secret sharing protocols were not used to in these ciss protocols .",
    "hence , it is desired to construct a ciss protocol by converting an existing secret sharing protocol .",
    "such a construction is called a _",
    "universal _ construction .",
    "the protocol in @xcite is universal in this sense .",
    "but , it was constructed by converting an existing secret sharing protocol only when the share is given as an element of a finite field .",
    "so , to make the scheme more secure , it needs a finite field of larger size .",
    "our construction is universally given when the share of the existing secret sharing protocol is given as an element of vector space of a finite field .",
    "that is , it does not require a finite field of large size .    from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "we need to care about the calculation complexity of the protocol .",
    "a protocol is efficient when its calculation complexity is not so large .",
    "when the players identify the cheaters with probability @xmath8 , the calculation complexity of the protocols given in @xcite is @xmath12 . when the protocol is universally constructed , the total calculation complexity depends on the original secret sharing protocol . in this case",
    ", we focus on the calculation complexity except for the part of the original protocol . in this sense ,",
    "the protocol in @xcite is @xmath12 , and our protocol is also @xmath12 .",
    "however , we can not necessarily choose the security parameter @xmath9 freely . in the protocols in @xcite ,",
    "the security parameter @xmath9 depends on the size of secret .",
    "hence , it is desired to flexibly choose the security parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we call a protocol flexible , when the security parameter @xmath9 can be set independently , i.e. , independent of the secret size .",
    "flexibility provides the power of partial customization of length of random strings , according to the requirement .",
    "the protocol in @xcite can flexibly choose the security parameter @xmath9 by adjusting the finite field with prime size .",
    "also , the protocol in @xcite can flexibly choose the security parameter @xmath9 by adjusting the finite field appearing in the original protocol .",
    "although these protocols offer the flexibility , the security parameter @xmath9 depends on the size of the finite field .",
    "the above calculation complexity @xmath12 can be realized by suitable choices of the size of the finite field in these protocols @xcite . hence",
    ", the choice of the security parameter @xmath9 has a certain restriction when we keep the calculation complexity @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , it is desired to completely freely choose the security parameter @xmath9 .",
    "fortunately , our protocol works with any finite field , and the security parameter @xmath9 can be freely chosen independently of the size of the finite field and the secret size . therefore , our protocol is flexible and works even with finite field @xmath13 , which simplifies the realization .",
    "overall , the comparison of the performances of existing protocols with ours is summarized as table [ hikaku ] .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] gives our ciss protocol for individual identification .",
    "section [ s3 ] shows its security .",
    "section [ s4 ] gives our ciss protocols for agreed identification and detection .",
    "section [ s5 ] compares the overhead of ours with those of existing protocols .",
    "let @xmath2 be the number of players and @xmath14 be the security parameter .",
    "that is , we will construct our protocol so that the verifier identifies the cheater with probability more than @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a secret sharing protocol realizing access structure @xmath5 with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an @xmath19-dimensional vector space @xmath20 over a finite filed @xmath21 . to present our ciss protocol for individual identification based on the protocol @xmath16 , we make preparation as follows . for the secret @xmath0",
    ", we define the random number @xmath22 as the share of the @xmath23-th player , which is sent by the dealer . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the dealer independently generates @xmath25 random numbers @xmath26 taking values in @xmath27 .",
    "also , the dealer independently generates @xmath28 toeplitz matrix @xmath29 .",
    "then , the dealer calculates the random number @xmath30 .",
    "now , we give our ciss protocol for individual identification as protocol [ protocol1 ] . from protocol [ protocol1 ] , we find that its calculation complexity is @xmath31 .",
    "the dealer sends the @xmath23-th player the publishable information @xmath32 and the identification - information @xmath33 .",
    "the players wishing to open the information send their publishable information .",
    "the players reconstruct the original information from the collection of @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath23-th player checks whether the relation @xmath35 holds when the information received from the @xmath36-th player is @xmath37 .",
    "since the function @xmath38 is a universal@xmath39 hash function with the randomly chosen toeplitz matrix @xmath29 , the relation holds with probability smaller than @xmath40 if the @xmath23-th player makes a cheat .",
    "therefore , even though all of players except for the @xmath36-th player makes cheating even with collusion , the @xmath36-th player can identify who makes cheating with high probability as fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .    also ,",
    "even though several players collude together , they can not obtain any information for the shares by other players as follows . to see this fact , we assume that the @xmath41-th player , the @xmath42-th player , @xmath43 , the @xmath44-th player collude together .",
    "we focus on the information @xmath45 shared by the @xmath36-th player .",
    "since @xmath26 is independent and uniform , @xmath46 are independent of @xmath47 .",
    "since they obtain no information for @xmath47 , they obtain no information @xmath45 .",
    "thus , if the original protocol with share @xmath45 works as secret sharing well , our protocol also works as secret sharing well .    in summary , we have the following theorem .",
    "protocol [ protocol1 ] is an @xmath48-ciss protocol realizing access structure @xmath5 with secret space @xmath1 and share space @xmath49 .",
    "now , we can give our ciss protocol for agreed identification as protocol [ protocol2 ] .",
    "the dealer sends the @xmath23-th player the publishable information @xmath32 and the identification - information @xmath33 .",
    "the players wishing to open the information send their first part information .",
    "the players wishing to open the information send their second part information .",
    "the players reconstruct the original information from the collection of @xmath34 .",
    "we employ the majority voting of the results of respective individual identification .    since the majority voting of the results of respective individual verifications identifies who makes cheating if more than half of the players wishing the reconstruction are honest , we have the following theorem",
    ".    protocol [ protocol2 ] is a @xmath50-ciss protocol realizing access structure @xmath5 with secret space @xmath1 and share space @xmath49 .",
    "modifying step 5 in protocol [ protocol2 ] in the following way , we can make a ciss protocol , which is called protocol [ protocol2]@xmath51 . if there exists a player who individually identifies at least one cheater",
    ", we consider that there exists a cheater .",
    "so , protocol [ protocol2]@xmath51 detects the existence of the cheaters with probability @xmath52 as fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , which yields the following theorem .",
    "protocol [ protocol2]@xmath51 is an @xmath53-diss protocol realizing access structure @xmath5 with secret space @xmath1 and share space @xmath49 .",
    "now , we consider the case when more than half players collude together .",
    "we assume that only the @xmath54-th player is honest and that the majority cheater , the @xmath41-th player , @xmath43 the @xmath44-th player collude together .",
    "the cheater , the @xmath55-th player rewrites @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 so that @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . due to the majority voting ,",
    "the agreed identification is that the honest player , the @xmath54-th player is a cheater .",
    "therefore , when the majority make cheating , the identification of our ciss protocol for agreed identification is incorrect while the identification of our ciss protocol for individual identification is correct , as fig .",
    "first , we compare the overhead of the protocol in @xcite with ours .",
    "let @xmath64 be the size of the share of the original secret sharing protocol .",
    "when the success probability is @xmath8 , the size of the share of their ciss protocol is greater than @xmath65 .",
    "that is , their overhead is @xmath66 .",
    "however , our protocol has overhead @xmath67 .",
    "that is , the their exponential coefficient with respect to the security parameter @xmath9 is twice as ours .",
    "next , we compare the overhead of the protocol in @xcite with ours .",
    "since their protocol is specified to the @xmath3-threshold scheme , we translate our overhead to the @xmath3-threshold scheme .",
    "when the secret size is @xmath68 , the conventional @xmath3-threshold scheme has share size @xmath69 for some polynomial @xmath70 .",
    "when we construct our ciss protocol based on this secret sharing protocol , the share size is @xmath71 .",
    "that is , its exponential coefficient with respect to the security parameter @xmath9 is still @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath73-ciss protocol in @xcite has share size @xmath74 .",
    "that is , its exponential coefficient with respect to the security parameter @xmath9 is @xmath75 .",
    "so , when @xmath4 is close to @xmath2 , these two overheads are almost the same .",
    "firstly , we have proposed to distinguish a ciss protocol for individual identification from a ciss protocol for agreed identification . then , based on any existing secret sharing protocol , we have universally constructed ciss protocols for individual identification and agreed identification as well as a cdss protocol .",
    "our ciss protocol for individual identification and our cdss protocol well work even when more than half of the players involved in reconstruction are cheaters .",
    "our ciss protocol for agreed well works when less than half of the players in reconstruction are cheaters .",
    "our protocols have calculation complexity @xmath12 when the probability of successfully identifying ( detecting ) the cheaters is @xmath8 .",
    "we can freely choose the security parameter @xmath9 independently of the secret size and share size of the original secret sharing protocol . also , we do not use huge finite fields .",
    "that is , we can realize any security parameter @xmath9 even with the finite field @xmath13 .",
    "these characteristics simplify the realization .",
    "we have checked that the overhead of our protocols are not so huge in comparison with existing protocols .",
