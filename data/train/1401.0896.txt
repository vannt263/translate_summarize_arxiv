    "<S> public talk at the emqm13 conference opening event on `` the future of quantum mechanics ''    the organizers have asked me to state my views on the direction of the future development of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> will it evolve within the standard framework , without the addition of new foundational physics ? or will the foundations require modification in an , at least in principle , experimentally detectable way ?    </S>",
    "<S> first , let s discuss the current status of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanics is our most successful physical theory . </S>",
    "<S> it underlies our detailed understanding of atomic physics , chemistry , and nuclear physics , and the many technologies based on this knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , relativistic quantum mechanics is the basis for the very successful standard model of elementary particles .    </S>",
    "<S> however , from its beginnings there have been conceptual problems associated with the nature of measurement in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> these can be simply illustrated with the famous stern - gerlach experiment ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) .        </S>",
    "<S> silver atoms boiled off from a furnace are sent through a non - uniform magnetic field , and impinge on a photographic plate . instead of a continuous distribution of spots , </S>",
    "<S> one sees two spots , corresponding to spin up and spin down relative to the magnetic field axis . </S>",
    "<S> each atom goes up or down , but one can not predict which in any given run  the results of the experiment are probabilistic . there is a 50% chance of an atom going up , and a 50% chance that it will go down .    from the point of view of the schrdinger equation of quantum theory , this result has no explanation . in quantum theory , the state of the particle is described by its wave function , and the schrdinger equation says that at a post - measurement final time @xmath0 , the wave function is related to that at a pre - measurement initial time @xmath1 , by a deterministic relation @xmath2 with the transition operator @xmath3 completely specified by the hamiltonian @xmath4 . to explain what is observed , the schrdinger equation must be supplemented by the reduction postulate and the born rule . </S>",
    "<S> these state that the wave function only gives a description of probabilities when a measurement is made , with the probabilities for an `` up '' outcome and a `` down '' outcome given by the squares of the coefficients of the corresponding components in the initial wave function @xmath5 , @xmath6 with the sum of the up and down probabilities equal to one . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction postulate and born rule are an add - on to the schrdinger equation . according to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation applies when a microscopic system , the silver atom , is time - evolving in isolation . </S>",
    "<S> but when the atom interacts with a macroscopic measuring apparatus , as in the stern  gerlach setup , you have to use the reduction postulate and born rule .    </S>",
    "<S> this situation leads to puzzles that have been debated for over eighty years . if quantum mechanics describes the whole universe , then why ca nt one use the schrdinger equation to describe the system consisting of the silver atom plus the measuring apparatus ? but we never see a superposition state of the atom plus apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> this is schrdinger s famous cat paradox . </S>",
    "<S> arrange the experiment so that an``up '' outcome triggers a mechanism that kills the cat , while a `` down '' outcome keeps the cat alive . </S>",
    "<S> of course we do nt do this , but if we were to do it , we would always see a live cat or a dead one , never a superposition of the two ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so we have the problem of definite outcomes : where does the `` either''``or''dichotomy arise ?        </S>",
    "<S> a related question is where do the probabilities come from ? </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanics has probabilities without a sample space ! </S>",
    "<S> an example of a sample space is a population of people , 40% blonde and 60% brunette . </S>",
    "<S> if you pick a person at random from the population , there is a probability @xmath7 that you will have a blonde , and @xmath8 that you will have a brunette . </S>",
    "<S> but the population ( the sample space ) is composed of individuals , with definite hair coloring  the probabilities only reflect our ignorance of details if we make a random pick without looking . </S>",
    "<S> another example of a sample space , closer to our stern  </S>",
    "<S> gerlach experiment , is a coin toss . </S>",
    "<S> consider 1000 coin tosses . </S>",
    "<S> if the coin is tossed without bias , you will find close to 500 heads and 500 tails , corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 . here </S>",
    "<S> the sample space consists of the 1000 detailed trajectories of the toss , which your eye can not follow , but which if analyzed by a very fast computer could predict which toss would give a head and which a tail ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . again </S>",
    "<S> , the probabilities are just reflections of our ignorance of the details , but the details are there . </S>",
    "<S> so we have the questions  are there hidden details underlying the probabilities in quantum mechanics </S>",
    "<S> ? is there a hidden sample space ?        </S>",
    "<S> now we come to the question with which i began  where is future work to deal with these problems headed ? </S>",
    "<S> two routes proceed within quantum theory : ( i ) the first route within quantum theory is to try to change the interpretational rules . </S>",
    "<S> examples are the so - called `` many worlds '' interpretation ( all possibilities are there , we just only see one ) , and the so - called `` histories '' program , which sets up an observer - free generalization of the copenhagen rules . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the second route within quantum theory is to say there is a sample space , but we do nt see it . </S>",
    "<S> one example is the proposal of bohmian trajectories as the sample space underlying the born rule . </S>",
    "<S> another example comprises various statistical interpretations , which attribute the probabilistic outcomes to different internal states of the apparatus and or its environment , with the aim of deriving the born rule .    </S>",
    "<S> none of these routes within orthodox quantum theory has gained general acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> also , none makes experimental predictions at odds with standard theory , so experimentally they are not distinguishable .    </S>",
    "<S> the other possibility is to modify the foundations of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , one gets a sample space by postulating additional degrees of freedom  so called `` hidden variables '' .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two possibilities for hidden variables  they can be _ local _ , or _ </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal_. local variables have the property that variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the spatial points and @xmath14 the times of occurrence , can not influence one another if the distance between them @xmath15 is greater than the distance @xmath16 that light can travel , at velocity @xmath17 , in the time interval from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> such local variables are called causally separated . in quantum theory , </S>",
    "<S> causally separated variables have a commutative multiplication law @xmath20 ordinary numbers obey such a commutative law of multiplication , for example @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , whereas in non - commutative multiplication , one would have @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> john bell s theorem asserts that local hidden variables plus the usual rules for probabilities imply certain inequalities that are not satisfied by quantum mechanical systems  and experiment sees that these inequalities are in fact violated . </S>",
    "<S> there is much discussion of possible loopholes , but i believe the result is robust , and that local hidden variables are excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> the other possibility is that the hidden variables are non - local : the hidden variables can act faster than the speed of light to establish correlations ( as long as no faster than light signaling is possible ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hidden variables can also obey a non - commutative multiplication law .    </S>",
    "<S> for the rest of the talk i ll focus on the possibility of non - local hidden variables  this is where my research interests lie . at a phenomenological level </S>",
    "<S> , there are very interesting models for the emergence of probabilities within the usual wave function formulation of nonrelativistic quantum theory , pioneered by ghirardi , rimini , and weber in trieste and by also by pearle at hamilton college in the u. s. , and worked on by many others . </S>",
    "<S> these models postulate that space is filled with a very low level noise with a coupling to matter proportional to the imaginary unit @xmath25 , rather than with a real - valued coupling ( more technically , they couple through an anti - hermitian hamiltonian term ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there could be a small , rapidly fluctuating contribution to the gravitational potential or @xmath26 metric component proportional to the imaginary unit @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> if such a theory obeys two general properties , ( 1 ) the total probability of a particle being present remains one for all times ( that is , the wave function normalization is preserved ) , and ( 2 ) there is no faster than light signaling , then the extra terms in the schrdinger equation equation must have a special structure . </S>",
    "<S> this special structure allows one to _ prove _ definite outcomes obeying the born rule !    in these models , for each repetition of the stern  </S>",
    "<S> gerlach experiment , the noise variable takes different values . for a large apparatus </S>",
    "<S> , these have a measurable effect , whereas for an atom not interacting with an apparatus , the effect is not measurable . </S>",
    "<S> the noise leads to different outcomes for different runs , with probabilities given by the born rule . </S>",
    "<S> the different noises for different runs of the experiment are analogous , in the coin toss example i gave earlier , to different details of the tumbling coin trajectories for the different coin tosses ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) .        </S>",
    "<S> i ve worked on phenomenological reduction models , but my main long term interest has been at the foundational level . </S>",
    "<S> i am trying to make an analogy between quantum mechanics emerging from a possible pre - quantum theory , and the known fact that thermodynamics emerges from the laws of statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamics  the science of heat and work ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 )  reflects averaged properties of huge numbers of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> it is a complete , consistent system by itself , and remarkably was discovered in the 19th century _ before _ </S>",
    "<S> the existence of atoms was established . </S>",
    "<S> but from statistical mechanics  the laws of motion of large systems of atoms , one can deduce the laws of thermodynamics , together with details of fluctuation corrections to thermodynamics , so called brownian motion corrections . </S>",
    "<S> ( the figure shows the random walk trajectory of a pollen grain being bombarded by molecules in thermal motion . )          </S>",
    "<S> my conjectures thus are : statistical averages in trace dynamics give the schrdinger equation and operator algebra of quantum theory , while brownian motion corrections give the low level noise on which phenomenological reduction models are based . </S>",
    "<S> i talked about this program in my keynote address at the vienna conference two years ago . </S>",
    "<S> currently i am working on incorporating gravity into trace dynamics , and that is what i will talk about tomorrow . </S>",
    "<S> my approach to an emergent quantum theory is still a work in progress  there is much yet to be done !    </S>",
    "<S> i wish to thank gerhard grssing for organizing the conference emqm13 on emergent quantum mechanics , the fetzer franklin fund for its financial support , and susan higgins for redrawing my figure sketches for publication . </S>"
