    "in view of the various applications in the anti - de - sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence , black hole solutions in ads have received much attention in the literature@xcite . in the original formulation by maldacena@xcite",
    ", it is conjectured that type iib superstring theory in @xmath0 is dual to @xmath1 u(@xmath2 ) super - yang - mills theory in @xmath3-dimensions .",
    "this has been generalized to other dimensions . in principle",
    ", the geometry of spacetimes can be affected by the presence of branes in asymptotically locally ads spacetime .",
    "seiberg and witten showed quite generically that if a certain function ( the brane action ) defined on the wick - rotated spacetime becomes negative , the spacetime becomes unstable@xcite .    specifically , given a bps ( bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ) brane @xmath4 in wick - rotated @xmath5-dimensional spacetime , the seiberg - witten brane action in the appropriate unit is a function of radial coordinate @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 = \\mathcal{a}(\\sigma ) - ( d-1)\\mathcal{v}(\\sigma ) , $ ] where @xmath8 is the area of @xmath4 and @xmath9 its volume .",
    "the instability is caused by nucleations of brane - anti - brane pairs at the regions where the brane action is negative , a phenomenon analogous to schwinger pair - production in strong electromagnetic fields@xcite .",
    "the presence of copious amount of branes alters the geometry .",
    "prior to seiberg and witten s work , maldacena , michelson , and strominger already pointed out that various ads geometries are prone to such drastic changes , which they referred to as `` fragmentation''@xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that seiberg - witten instability applies to any @xmath5-dimensional spacetime ( @xmath10 ) with an asymptotically hyperbolic euclidean version ( so that it has well - defined conformal boundary ) , even for string theory on @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a @xmath5-dimensional non - compact asymptotically hyperbolic manifold ( generalizing @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 a compact space ( generalizing @xmath15)@xcite .",
    "topological black holes can have event horizon with positive , zero , or negative scalar curvature @xmath16 .",
    "the positively curved black holes include the usual schwarzschild black hole with @xmath17 topology , where @xmath5 is the spacetime dimension , and also black holes of @xmath18 topology , i.e. quotient of @xmath17 by the action of some discrete group @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , the event horizon of @xmath20 and @xmath21 black holes have the topology of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .    in the context of general relativity",
    ", it was shown that @xmath24 black holes have positive brane action , while for @xmath21 case , the brane action _",
    "always _ become negative and stay negative@xcite .",
    "thus positively curved black holes are stable ( of course being stable in seiberg - witten sense do not preclude the possibility that it is unstable due to other effects ) but negatively curved ones are inherently unstable .",
    "of course the onset of every instability is associated with a _ time scale _ , thus even unstable black holes could be effectively meta - stable@xcite .",
    "noting that ads / cft correspondence is likely to occur in any quantum theory of gravity , as the existence of holographic dualities is not contingent on the validity of string theory@xcite , we expect that something similar , if not identical , to seiberg - witten instability is likely to be a feature in _ any _ quantum gravity theory that admits extended objects ( e.g. branes ) propagating in asymptotically ads spaces .",
    "we therefore investigate the stability of topological black holes in the context of hoava - lifshitz gravity@xcite .",
    "we find that in certain range of the detailed balance parameter @xmath25 ( general relativity is recovered with @xmath26 , while hoava - lifshitz gravity with detailed balance condition corresponds to @xmath27 ) , the black holes in hoava - lifshitz theory can have brane action that is only negative in some _ finite _ range of radial coordinate .",
    "this is markedly different from black holes in general relativity in which once the brane action becomes negative , it _",
    "always _ stays negative .",
    "brane action with this property was previously found in the context of cosmology by maldacena and maoz@xcite .",
    "such black holes are expected to be stable in the sense that backreaction is very likely to set in and the systems eventually settle into a new , stable configurations .",
    "the maldacena - maoz type of instability that occurs in hoava - lifshitz gravity naturally raises the suspicion that it could be due to the non - relativistic and lorentz - violating nature of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "however , we find that such instability also arises in the relatively simpler einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory , which is a low energy limit of string theory .    in particular , extending previous work in ref .",
    ", we showed that@xcite for dilaton coupling @xmath28 , asymptotically locally ads charged dilaton gao - zhang black holes with flat horizon have positive brane action and thus is stable in seiberg - witten sense . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the stability is of maldacena - maoz type .",
    "we proved that in both cases , the asymptotic behavior of the brane action is logarithmically divergent for finite @xmath30 .",
    "with the examples from hoava - lifshitz and einstein - maxwell - dilaton theories , we emphasize that we still lack a _ quantitative _ way to investigate the sufficient and necessary condition for a spacetime with maldacena - maoz instability capable of settling down to a stable solution due to backreaction from the brane .",
    "we know that there are manifolds where once brane action becomes negative at the conformal boundary , _ can not _ be deformed to have non - negative brane action@xcite . however , the situation in general , especially in the case of maldacena - maoz type of instability , is far from settled .",
