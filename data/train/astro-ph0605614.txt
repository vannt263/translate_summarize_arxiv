    "recent observations of the absorption spectra of the highest redshift quasars show very strong gunn - peterson(gp ) troughs at @xmath3 ( fan et al . 2002 ; songaila & cowie 2002 ; white et al .",
    "2003 ; songaila 2004 ; becker et al . 2006 ; fan et al .",
    "the spectra are found to be dramatically different from low redshift ( @xmath4 ) samples .",
    "first , the blue sides of the ly@xmath5 emission lines are almost completely absorbed , indicating very high absorption optical depths ; and second , there are long flux dark gaps of about tens of mpc separated by tiny light leaks in the spectra .",
    "it has been suggested that these observations indicate the end stage of reionization at redshift @xmath6 .    in low redshift range , @xmath7 , ly@xmath5 forests can be explained by absorptions of fluctuated neutral hydrogen atoms in the igm with a uniform uv ionizing background ( e.g. rauch 1998 ) . in this model , about 80% of the baryons are associated with observed ly@xmath5 forest features , while 10% are in the smaller column densities which are not detectable and the other 10% are in collapsed objects ( e.g. bi & davidsen 1997 ) .    if the distribution of the igm is uniform and the ionizing background is independent of redshift , the photoionization equilibrium requires the mean optical depth @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number density of the igm , and @xmath10 is hubble parameter .",
    "one can then expect larger gunn - peterson troughs at higher redshift .",
    "the current observations show , however , that the mean optical depth actually underwent a much faster evolution at @xmath6 than the @xmath11 relation .",
    "to explain this fact it was suggested that the uv background has a strong evolution around @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the observed gunn - peterson troughs are characterized remarkably by a large scatter in statistics .",
    "for example , some spectra show complete absorptions while some others show apparent transmissions .",
    "the scatter is proposed to be due to the existence of a significantly fluctuating uv background at @xmath6 ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) .    recently , there are a number of simulations or semi - analytical models aiming at the gp effect at those redshifts ( e.g. razoumov et al .",
    "2002 ; gnedin 2004 ; pascho & norman 2005 ; wyithe & loeb 2005 ; kohler et al .",
    "2005 ; gallerani et al . 2006 ) .",
    "those studies generally concluded that the uv background or photoionization rate should be rapidly decreasing toward @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is inconclusive on whether a significant inhomogeneity in the uv background is necessary .",
    "lidz et al . ( 2006 ) correctly pointed out that transmission spectra are sensitive to rare big voids , and therefore , the observed scatter in optical depths can be produced from density fluctuations without assuming an inhomogeneous uv background .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the long - tailed distributions of transmitted flux and long dark gaps can also be explained by their simulation , because the size of their simulation box is closer or even smaller than the scales of dark gaps in quasar spectra , which can be as large as a few tens h@xmath13mpc . therefore , the problem of inhomogeneous uv background is still under a cloud .",
    "there are , at least , two other reasons to motivate us to reconsider this problem .",
    "first , the redshift dependence of the mean mass density is @xmath14 , and then @xmath15 .",
    "thus , a mass density fluctuation @xmath16 on large scales is approximately equivalent to a variation in redshift or in wavelength @xmath17 .",
    "therefore once there is strong evolution of @xmath18 on redshift , i.e. , @xmath19 , the fluctuations of density @xmath16 on large scales will yield large variations of @xmath20 , even when the uv background is uniform .",
    "second , when the gp depth is very large , the only regions which are left with leaking lights are rare void events in the random field .",
    "those rare events are described by the long - tailed pdf of the igm density field .",
    "the long tails in the lognormal model is found to fit well with high order statistics of the ly@xmath5 transmitted flux ( feng & fang 2000 , zhan et al .",
    "2001 , feng et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 , jamkhedkar et al . 2000 , 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , it is worth to study the effect of the rare events in the lognormal model at high redshifts .",
    "because it is a semi - analytical model , we can take 1-d simulations with spatial ranges as large as a few hundreds h@xmath13mpc , and resolutions as fine as a tenth of the jeans length ( a few h@xmath13kpc ) .",
    "we simulate lyman series absorption spectra of qsos between @xmath21 and 6.4 using the same lognormal method as those for low redshifts @xmath22 ( e.g. , bi et al . 1995 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ) . in this model ,",
    "the density field @xmath23 of the igm is given by an exponential mapping of the linear density field @xmath24 as @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the variance of the linear density field on scale of the jeans length .",
    "in this model , the peculiar velocity field is also produced by a gaussian random field , for which the relevant parameteres are selected to make the statistical relation between density and velocity fields follow the predictions of linear fluctuation theory ( bi & davidsen 1997 ; nusser & haehnelt 1999 ; choudhury et al .",
    "2001 ; gallerani et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the dynamical bases of the lognormal model have gradually been settled in recent years .",
    "first , although the evolution of cosmic baryon fluid is governed by the naiver - stokes equation , the dynamics of growth modes of the fluid can be sketched by a stochastic force driven burgers equation ( gurbatov et al .",
    "1989 ; berera & fang 1994 ; matarrese & mohayaee 2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the lognormal field is found to be a good approximation of the solution of the burgers equation ( jones 1999 ) .",
    "the one - point distribution of the cosmic density and velocity fields on nonlinear regime are consistent with lognormal distribution ( e.g. kofman et al .",
    "1994 , hui et al .",
    "2000 , yang et al .",
    "2001 , pando et al .",
    "especially , it has been shown recently that the velocity field of the baryonic matter of the standard @xmath27cdm model is well described by the so - called she - lvque s universal scaling formula , which is given by a hierarchical process with log - poisson probability distribution ( he et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , our purpose is to study whether the observed lyman absorptions of qsos at high redshifts can really rule out models with a uniform uv background .",
    "therefore , we assume that the uv background is spatially uniform , contributed by qsos and active galaxies , and is represented by an photoionization rate @xmath28 , which is allowed to change in the redshift range @xmath29 . the baryonic gas is heated by the uv background .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of the igm are actually complicate , because nonlinear evolution leads to a multi - phased igm .",
    "for a given mass density , the temperature of the igm can be different by 1 to 2 orders ( he et al .",
    "2004 ) . nevertheless , the igm temperature is related to mass density by a power law @xmath30 in the density range @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the mean density ( see also hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "the neutral fraction is solved under photoionization equilibrium assumption . to consider the peculiar velocity effect and thermal broadening",
    ", we do a convolution of the neutral hydrogen density and velocity field with voigt profile .",
    "this yields the absorption optical depth .",
    "we use the standard @xmath27cdm cosmological model that is generally accepted in this type of studies and consistent with the new wmap data ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the temperature at the mean density is @xmath38 and there is a cut - off of the minimal temperature at @xmath39 . in redshift space ,",
    "the size of the simulation samples is given by @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "there are @xmath42 pixels in each redshift range @xmath43 .",
    "we produced @xmath44 samples for @xmath45 , and 2000 for @xmath46 , so as to get the gp depth and their variance .",
    "when comparing to relevant observations , we have divided the samples to sub - samples with about the same redshift interval ( which is 0.15 in fan et al .",
    "2006 ) , properly smoothed the mock spectra with observational resolution and added instrumental noise .",
    "\\1 . _ gp optical depth . _",
    "we first try to fit the strong evolution of the gp optical depth @xmath18 of ly@xmath5 absorption .",
    "this can easily be done if we take the photoionization rate to be @xmath47 ^ 3 \\}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is in unit of 10@xmath48 s@xmath13 , @xmath49 being a free parameter .",
    "eq.(2 ) shows that @xmath50 undergoes a strong evolution when @xmath51 , probably due to a strong evolution of star formation rates .",
    "this model is consistent with the general argument that collapsed objects underwent a fast evolution at larger redshifts ( bi et al .",
    "we found that @xmath18 in redshift range @xmath52 can be well fitted by eq.(2 ) if the fitting parameter @xmath49 is in the range 3.0 - 3.2 .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1 , and the observed data are taken from songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) and fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the resultant neutral fraction is about @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 at @xmath56 and 6.4 in the @xmath57 model , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the @xmath61 model .",
    "_ variance of gp optical depth .",
    "_ figure 2 presents the variance of @xmath18 from an ensemble of 1000 ( @xmath45 ) or 2000 ( @xmath62 ) simulation samples .",
    "they are in good agreement with observed data ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) , also shown in figure 2 .",
    "when we look into the details of simulation samples , we found the scatter is really large .",
    "that is to say , the ensemble of simulated spectra contains samples of complete absorption as well as samples of apparent transmission .",
    "the optical depth is very sensitive to the density fluctuations when the average gp optical depth is large . around @xmath63 ,",
    "the average transmission is basically contributed by lights leaking from only a few low density voids in the fluctuating density field .",
    "they are rare evens , but they are not negligible if the pdf of the density is long - tailed . in other words ,",
    "the variance of the optical depth mainly depends on long - tailed low - density events .",
    "if a physical phenomenon biases to rare events , the variance generally is large .",
    "_ pdf of flux .",
    "_ figure 3 presents the probability distributions of the transmitted flux of ly@xmath5 absorption at redshifts @xmath64 , 5.7 and 6.0 .",
    "the observed data are from fan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . here",
    "we use the simulation size of @xmath65 in redshift , smooth the simulated spectra by a gaussian instrument of resolution 2600 and then binned them into pixels of @xmath66 km s@xmath13 , which are about the same as observation .",
    "we also add noises in the simulated spectra .",
    "the result shows again that the simulated distributions of the flux are in good agreement with observations .",
    "figure 3 shows that most pixels have only very small transmitted flux , which correspond to opaque regions in spectra .",
    "figure 3 also shows that although the spectra are general opaque , there do exist rare but not negligible high transmitted flux .",
    "the long - tail is typical for a lognormal random field .",
    "figure 3 is consistent with fig .",
    "2 that the observed large scatter of the gp optical depth could be caused by the fluctuations of the igm density field , not necessarily by irregularities in the spatial distribution of the uv background .    \\4 .",
    "_ dark gaps .",
    "_ in figure 4 , we present the evolution of mean dark gaps as a function of redshift . the dark gap is defined as the continuous region in which all pixels have optical depth larger than 2.5 .",
    "the mean dark gap from the simulations has a strong evolution at @xmath67 , and is generally consistent with observations .",
    "however , we note that the gap at high redshift is sensitive to the smoothing .",
    "if we use the original spectra without instrumental effects , the mean dark gap is smaller than that with smoothing .",
    "this is because light leaking areas , which are used to define the boundaries of the gaps , are very small and show up as spikes in spectra .",
    "therefore , they will disappear if take a smoothing on larger scale .",
    "figure 4 shows that the significant increase of dark gap size at @xmath2 can also be reproduced by the strong evolution of @xmath18 alone .",
    "we show that the lognormal model can uniformly and reasonably explain the observed statistical properties of the ly@xmath5 gp absorption at high redshifts @xmath68 , if the intensity of the uniform uv background , undergoes a strong evolution around @xmath69 .",
    "the large scatter of optical depths and large dark gaps are resulted naturally from the strong evolution of the optical depth .",
    "these abnormal features may not imply the existence of significantly spatial fluctuations in the uv ionizing background .",
    "of course , fluctuations of the uv ionizing background with power less than the density perturbations are possible in this model .",
    "it is interesting to compare the strong evolution of the optical depth @xmath70 , with phase transition .",
    "the condition @xmath70 is typical in phase transition when the igm transits from the state ( phase ) of opaque to transparency with the decrease of the uv background .",
    "it likes phase transition due to the increase of pressure . around the point of phase transition",
    ", the long wavelength perturbations will cause large fluctuations in the system considered .",
    "for instance , a normally transparent medium appears milky at critical point due to the correlations caused by long wavelength fluctuations . at redshift @xmath12 ,",
    "the density of neutral hydrogen atoms is high enough , on average , to cause complete gunn - peterson absorption troughs .",
    "but long wavelength fluctuations can make some lines of sight passing through regions where the gp absorption are low .",
    "although these events are rare , they are not negligible because the pdf of density distribution is long - tailed . in this case , the large fluctuations of @xmath20 are directly determined by @xmath70 , regardless the inhomogeneity of the uv background .",
    "we also calculate the statistical properties of ly@xmath71 and @xmath72 transmitted fluxes .",
    "they have the similar behaviors as those of ly@xmath5 .",
    "since the absorption section of ly@xmath71 and @xmath72 are smaller , the spectra would be more sensitive to the uv background .",
    "they could be used as better constraints on the uv background . however , the current data are still not rich enough to provide an effective comparison with simulation samples .",
    "we conclude that in spite of the ly@xmath5 absorption spectra at @xmath2 show very different features from those at @xmath73 , the igm is probably still in the similar state as @xmath74 , i.e. , it is highly ionized by a spatially uniform uv background .",
    "the abnormal statistical features of the ly@xmath5 transmitted flux at @xmath2 are mainly inherited from rare events corresponding to the long - tails in the pdf of the igm density field .",
    "this picture is consistent with the other types of observations such as the luminosity function of ly@xmath5 emitter which keeps almost constant between redshift @xmath75 and 6.5 ( malhotra & rhoads 2004 ) , and the latest polarization map of cmb which implies that complete reionization may have already occurred at @xmath76(page et al .",
    "because non - gaussianity , such as spiky structures , intermittency etc . is sensitive to long - tailed events , our model can be effectively tested with the non - gaussianity of the ly@xmath5 transmitted flux when more data at high redshifts become available .",
