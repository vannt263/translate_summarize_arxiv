    "at last time the investigation of parametric dependent hamiltonians like @xmath0 is a subject of great interest . here",
    "@xmath1 is a set of canonical coordinates and impulses , and @xmath2 is a parameter describing connection of the system with the external field .",
    "interest to such systems is motivated by mesoscopic physics [ 1 ] .",
    "most of the works devoted to the parametric dependent systems are dealing with the investigation of following situation : for @xmath3 hamiltonian is exactly integrable . for @xmath4 hamiltonian",
    "@xmath0 becomes non - integrable and for some defined values of @xmath5 , solutions of classical equations generated by the hamiltonian @xmath6 display chaos .",
    "after this , the little variation of the parameter @xmath7 is of interest .",
    "using the basis @xmath8 in which @xmath9 is diagonal , for small values of @xmath10 , hamiltonian @xmath11 can be written in the form of sum of two matrix @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the diagonal matrix , and @xmath14 is the banded matrix , off - diagonal elements of which are random numbers [ 2 ] . by way of numerical diagonalization",
    "it is possible to define eigenvectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and eigenvalues @xmath17,@xmath18 corresponding to the hamiltonians @xmath11,@xmath19 appropriately .",
    "the main interest at this is connected with the dependence of parametric kernel @xmath20 from the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath21 averaged over the @xmath22 can be considered as the local density of states .",
    "descriptions of foregoing methods of solving of problems of quantum chaos are given in [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "goal of this paper is investigation of chaos in the system of interacting oscillators when both of the hamiltonians @xmath19 , @xmath11 display chaos .",
    "situation when the hamiltonian @xmath23 is integrable has been studied by us earlier ( see papers [ 6,7 ] ) .",
    "investigation of the following hamiltonian is of interest for us @xmath24    here and below we work with the dimensionless quantities .",
    "canonical equations for the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) are of form @xmath25 solutions for the set of equations in case of @xmath26 can be obtained only numerically . as is shown by numerical analyze ,",
    "solutions of the set of equations ( [ 2 ] ) for the values of the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 are essentially chaotic ( see fig.1 ) . for further calculations we have to obtain classical power spectrum with the purpose of its further comparison with the band profile .",
    "let us construct correlation function for @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 means averaging over the time , @xmath32 is the averaged values of @xmath33 .",
    "we have to make fourier transformation of the expression ( [ 3 ] ) to get classical power spectrum @xmath34 in the practical calculation of ( [ 4 ] ) we use the method equivalent of ( [ 4 ] ) @xmath35 here @xmath36 $ ] is time interval in which solution of the set of equations ( [ 2 ] ) is obtained , @xmath37 . to get the power spectrum one needs to use discrete form of expression ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath38 here @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is a number of dots dividing the interval @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the averaging parameter [ 8,9 ] .",
    "form of the classical power spectrum for the different values of the parameter @xmath44 is given on the figures fig .",
    "2 , fig.3 .",
    "these data are confirming the fact that solutions of ( [ 2 ] ) are chaotic .",
    "our subsequent goal is the comparison of the band profile @xmath45 considered as the function of @xmath46 with the classical band profile .",
    "let us set about to the quantum - mechanical analyze of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "eigenvectors @xmath47 of the basis , in which hamiltonian @xmath48 is diagonal can be found easily and are of the form [ 10 ] @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the hermite polynomials [ 11 ] .",
    "eigenvalue energy is given by the formula @xmath51 where @xmath52 condition ( [ 9 ] ) implies existence of the @xmath53 fold degeneration for the given @xmath22 .",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be done only numerically . on the figures 4 , and 5 dependence of the energy eigenvalues @xmath54 from the parameter @xmath2",
    "are plotted .",
    "according to fig.4 for the @xmath26 removal of degeneration takes place . in case of further increasing of the parameter @xmath2 up to the values characterizing the domain of chaotic motion @xmath27 , as easy to see from fig.5 , repulsion of the energy terms happens",
    "this fact is of great importance since the repulsion of the energy terms is a sine of emerging of quantum chaos [ 12 ] . for the defining of the band profile at first we need to find eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath55 .",
    "this problem is possible to resolve by way of numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath55 , at the values of @xmath56 in the basis of functions ( [ 7 ] ) @xmath57 since the matrix elements are satisfying the condition @xmath58 taking into account that @xmath59 and using the condition @xmath60 we get @xmath61 in ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) @xmath62 stands for kronecker delta function . substituting ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) into ( [ 10 ] ) after straightforward calculations one can obtain @xmath63 @xmath64 after forming from the matrix elements ( [ 13 ] ) matrix and making diagonalization one can obtain eigenvalues spectrum @xmath65 and basis of eigenvectors @xmath66 . calculating matrix elements of @xmath67 in the basis @xmath66",
    "we can get the band profile @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the mean level spacing , and @xmath70 is the system s dimension .",
    "coefficient @xmath71 is determined from the condition @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the density of states , and @xmath74 is the number of states in the energy interval @xmath75 .",
    "density of states in it s turn is possible to determine from the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath76 , or from the integral @xmath77 here the integral must be taken over the phase space enclosed by energy surface ( see fig.6 ) in our calculations we are interested in the domain in which classical motion is essentially chaotic : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "taking smaller values of @xmath83 leads to the necessity of diagonalization of matrix larger then our . in our case",
    "( @xmath84 ) matrix dimension is @xmath85 .",
    "band profile @xmath86 as a function of @xmath46 is plotted on the fig.7 .",
    "according to fig.7 band profile is in a good qualitative agreement with the classical power spectrum .",
    "better quantitative agreement is possible to achieve for smaller values of @xmath83 [ 1 ] ( since the quasi - classical approximation implies @xmath87 ) .",
    "another quantity we are interested in is the parametric kernel @xmath88 where the averaging is done over the several @xmath22 states .",
    "evidently ( [ 16 ] ) determines correlation between the wave functions . the parametric kernel ( [ 16 ] ) frequently is named as the local density of states ( lds ) [ 3 ] .",
    "we are interested in @xmath89 , since with its help , is possible to determine the boundaries in which perturbation theory is valid . for that one",
    "has to compare parametric kernel ( [ 16 ] ) with the results for lds obtained by means of perturbation theory [ 5 ] @xmath90 where the parameter @xmath91 for given @xmath92 must be defined from the normalization condition @xmath93 results of numerical calculations for the values @xmath94 and @xmath95 are presented on the figures fig.8 and fig.9 .",
    "on basis of obtained results we conclude that boundary in which perturbation theory for our system is correct is limited by the condition @xmath96 .",
