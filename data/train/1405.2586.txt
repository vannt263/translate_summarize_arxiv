    "despite the huge success of the standard model ( sm ) , compelling arguments indicate that new physics ( np ) should appear at the tev  scale .",
    "in particular , the absence of any symmetries protecting the brout - englert - higgs boson mass term leads to the expectation that the sm can not be universally valid .  as a possible solution to this puzzle , new regimes",
    "could be observed at that energy scale , with novel particles related to the top quark by a symmetry , therefore carrying similar quantum numbers .",
    "these new fermions may then contribute to stabilise the electroweak scale , and cancel the quadratically divergent contributions to the mass of the sm  scalar boson .",
    "although a sequential fourth family of quarks is excluded by the current searches , models going beyond the sm now point at the possibility for vector - like quarks ( vlqs ) , _ i.e. _ , new fermionic resonances having their left- and right- handed components transforming identically under the electroweak gauge group . referred to as top partners , these hypothetical quarks do not gain their masses from the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , and occur as a common feature of many np scenarios such as extra - dimensional models , strongly interacting dynamics , models with extended gauge symmetries , composite higgs models , and so forth . assuming that a single @xmath1 scalar doublet breaks the electroweak symmetry",
    ", minimal scenarios may allow these top partners to interact with the sm quarks through yukawa interactions .",
    "after that the sm  scalar boson develops its vacuum expectation value , the representations summarised in table [ tab : multiplets ] are allowed by @xmath2 gauge invariance . vector - like quark singlets and triplets mix dominantly with the standard left - handed doublets , whereas doublets couple to the standard right - handed singlets .",
    ".vector - like multiplets have fixed quantum numbers under @xmath2 , assuming that they mix with the sm quarks through yukawa couplings .",
    "the electric charge is the sum of the third component of the isospin @xmath3 , and of the hypercharge @xmath4 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     depending on their charge assignments , these new quarks decay into a standard quark plus a standard gauge boson , such that    * @xmath5 , * @xmath6 , * @xmath7 , * @xmath8 ,    where the index @xmath9 denotes the three  standard generations . the nominal branching fractions for @xmath0 or @xmath10 electroweak singlets are approximately 50% into @xmath11 bosons , and 25% into @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons , in agreement with the goldstone boson equivalence theorem .",
    "the exotic states @xmath14 and @xmath4 decay exclusively through charged currents to up- and down - type quarks , respectively .    as the guiding thread of this work ,",
    "we point out that vlqs decaying to top and bottom quarks ( @xmath15 ) have been studied to a great extent at the lhc , while the constraints on top partners decaying to light jets ( @xmath16 ) are still mild and require careful treatment . for this reason",
    ", we proposed in @xcite a model - independent framework to study the phenomenology of new top partners at the lhc , with general couplings to all three generations of sm  quarks .",
    "factoring out all model - dependent contributions , we performed a comprehensive analysis of all electroweak production channels for vlqs , relying on a minimal amount of parameters .",
    "based on this parametrisation , we provided a compendium of the corresponding cross - section contributions , for benchmark points satisfying the experimental constraints .",
    "our analysis allowed to highlight the potential relevance of scenarios which have been neglected in previous experimental searches , as well as of novel interesting channels to be studied at the lhc .",
    "since the start of its physics program , the lhc has delivered a large set of limits on new heavy coloured objects with spin 1/2 . however , reinterpreting consistently the available bounds for specific np  scenarios requires dedicated strategies to account for all the allowed signals . in the presence of multiple resonances , events for a given final state may occur through different decay chains and topologies .",
    "furthermore , the experimental efficiencies may be different depending on the considered model , affecting the rescaling of the mass bounds in a non - trivial way .",
    "some studies and related codes like checkmate , smodels and fastlim @xcite have already attempted to tackle this problem , however can not be thoroughly applied to scenarios with multiple top partners .    in the following",
    "we present a dedicated software named ` xqcat ` , for _ extra quark combined analysis tool _",
    "@xcite , that allows the user to determine the exclusion confidence level for any scenario involving vlqs .",
    "assuming strong pair - production as an input , the corresponding cross - sections are only sensitive to the masses of the new quarks .",
    "we simulated @xmath17\\{0,1,2 } for each mass value with madgraph5 .",
    "the subsequent decays are then computed with bridge , while hadronisation and showering are determined with pythia .",
    "detector simulation is performed through delphes2 .",
    "the full signal is reconstructed by combining , with the appropriate weights , the different model - independent topologies which generate the underlying final states and the corresponding kinematic distributions .",
    "we subsequently estimate the number of signal events passing the selection cuts for each signature and search , and extract the respective efficiencies for each subprocess contributing to the given final state . finally , for each implemented search ( or combination thereof ) , our analysis code evaluates the respective respective exclusion confidence level for a given input scenario .    to validate and apply our tool , we computed the 95% cl mass bounds for a @xmath0 singlet under different hypotheses for its branching ratios into sm bosons and quarks , considering two selected subsets of searches :    1 .",
    "_ direct searches : _ a comprehensive number of final states was accounted for in @xcite .  in this analysis ,",
    "the cms  collaboration presented an inclusive search for @xmath18 top partners , at @xmath19 tev and 19.5  fb@xmath20 of integrated luminosity .",
    "considering pair - produced objects mixing with third - generation quarks , cms obtained 95% cl lower limits on @xmath0 quark masses between 687  and 782  gev .",
    "susy searches : _ for the purpose of our analysis , we implemented the four supersymmetry - inspired searches @xcite at @xmath21 tev considering the entire 2011 dataset , and characterised by large missing transverse energy and different numbers of leptons in the final state .",
    "the updated searches @xcite at 8 tev have been included as well .  as we have checked that they are uncorrelated ,",
    "these searches may be statistically combined .    in the left plot of fig.[fig : t ] , we show the exclusion confidence levels  for a @xmath0 singlet with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . through linear interpolation of the exclusion confidence levels , we obtain a 2@xmath24 mass bound of 614 gev at 95%  cl , whereas the linear interpolation of the efficiencies excludes masses below 634 gev , slightly below the value of 668 gev quoted in @xcite ( multilepton channels only ) . yet , it is interesting to notice that the combination of the susy  searches @xcite set constraints in the same ballpark as the direct search @xcite .",
    "this selection of searches allows to address an interesting complementarity between direct analyses for vlqs and others performed at the lhc .",
    "although no specific search for pair - produced top partners decaying to light jets is currently available , it is shown that the susy searches already set significant bounds on these scenarios .",
    "on the right plot of fig.[fig : t ] , we display the exclusion confidence levels for a @xmath0 singlet mixing only with light quarks , such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the bound provided by linearly interpolating the ecls of the susy searches combination is 422 gev ( 469 gev if interpolating the efficiencies ) , while the direct search @xcite does not provide limits above @xmath27 gev at the 2@xmath24 level . considering that susy - inspired searches are not designed to probe such final states , it is remarkable that their combination is more sensitive than the analysis @xcite for this specific scenario .",
    "this points at the interest of combining multiple topology searches so as to obtain more accurate bounds on new physics models .",
