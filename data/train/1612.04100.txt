    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) is an extremely nonlinear optical process that provides coherent radiation in the extreme ultraviolet spectral region on an ultrafast time scale .",
    "such radiation is of great interest for applications such as coherent diffractive imaging of nanostructures  @xcite , pump - probe spectroscopy for studying dynamical electronic processes inside molecules  @xcite and attosecond science  @xcite .",
    "the range of generated wavelengths covered by the harmonics is usually limited , on the long wavelength side by reabsorption in the generating medium , and on the short wavelength side by lack of phase matching due to ionization .",
    "for example , the maximum harmonic order ( the shortest wavelength ) which can be phase matched in argon is the 35@xmath0 order ( @xmath124 nm ) when using femtosecond pulses from an 800 nm drive laser  @xcite .",
    "the laser intensities required for generating radiation of even shorter wavelengths are so high that a significant fraction of the gaseous medium becomes ionized . as a result of the generated transient plasma",
    ", there is an additional refractive index contribution which renders phase matching techniques ineffective due to wave - vector mismatch .    a technique that is generally seen as suitable for overcoming this ionization limitation and that allows one to efficiently generate higher order harmonics is so - called _ quasi - phase matching _ ( qpm )  @xcite .",
    "with the introduction of a spatially periodic structure of suitable periodicity , an extra wave vector can be provided that compensates the wave - vector mismatch .",
    "various schemes to demonstrate or make use of qpm in hhg have been proposed and developed .",
    "the idea is that efficient hhg is only enabled in the in - phase region and is suppressed in the out - of - phase region . as an example",
    ", a train of tunable counter - propagating pulses in a hollow - core waveguide has been used to introduce a spatially periodic ionization pattern for the generation of photon energies of several hundred electron volts  @xcite .",
    "other schemes include waveguides with a spatially periodic diameter  @xcite , multimode beating in a capillary  @xcite and polarization - beating in a birefringent waveguide  @xcite .",
    "recently , a small set of periodically spaced dual - gas jets , consisting of the generating gas ( argon ) and a passive gas ( hydrogen ) , has shown to shift harmonic generation up to the 41@xmath2 order ( @xmath119 nm )  @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are based on the assumption that , depending on the specific set of parameters used , there is a certain spatial period , @xmath3 , that provides phase matching .",
    "this assumption is much in analogy with second - order nonlinear conversion in periodically poled crystals where a particular conversion process with given input and output wavelengths requires a well - defined poling period .",
    "however , selecting an appropriate periodic structure for achieving qpm in hhg is actually rather problematic , since the wave - vector mismatch is strongly time dependent throughout the entire drive laser pulse .",
    "a fixed periodic structure may only be effective in achieving qpm during a certain short time interval within the drive laser pulse , such that the time - integrated ( total ) output pulse energy may still remain low . to demonstrate qpm for hhg in experiments using the schemes mentioned above , the selection of a fixed - periodic structure for maximizing the total high - order harmonic ( hh ) output is usually based on an unproven assumption , namely , that the quasi - phase matching period has to be chosen equal to twice the coherence length calculated for the time - instance where the intensity of the drive laser pulse is maximum ( at peak intensity ) .",
    "this is based on the argument that the nonlinearly induced dipole moment of the individual atoms is the highest at that time  @xcite . however , this assumption neglects any radiation that may be generated before and after the peak of the drive laser pulse .",
    "a direct experimental clarification is not known to us and difficult to carry out , due to the ultrashort time scales . instead , one is usually detecting or optimizing any phase matching in hhg via the output pulse energy .",
    "thus , for a proper discussion of optimizing qpm in hhg , one requires a time - dependent model of the output followed by a calculation of the output pulse energy .    here , we present the first time - dependent model for quasi - phase matching in high - order harmonic generation .",
    "we call this an extended model because it combines previously known physical effects into a more encompassing theory that delivers somewhat deviating predictions for optimizing the harmonic output . using a one - dimensional model , we include the full wave - vector mismatch with its ultrafast time dependence to calculate the hh field vs. time .",
    "the pulse energy is then obtained by time integration . for definiteness , and as a typical example , we consider hhg in argon gas where a periodic density pattern is provided , e.g. , with a grid in a supersonic jet .",
    "we show that the maximum harmonic pulse energy is obtained when choosing the qpm period for phase matching in the leading edge of the drive laser pulse , rather than at the peak .",
    "as our basis for investigating quasi - phase matching , we recall the well - known model of constant et al .",

    "the dependence on @xmath38 shows that the atomic dispersion decreases during the drive laser pulse .",
    "the contribution due to the free electrons in the plasma , on the contrary , is negative and becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial number density of atoms per mbar , and @xmath41 is the classical radius of the electron .",
    "this contribution via @xmath38 grows in magnitude vs. time .",
    "the wave - vector mismatch that arises from the gouy phase shift , resulting from the focusing of the drive laser beam , only varies in space .",
    "it also has a negative sign and can be expressed by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the position of the focus and @xmath44 is the rayleigh range .",

    "this expression can be chosen to be either positive or negative depending on the position of the focus with regard to the generating medium . placing the medium in front of ( behind ) the focus , where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , results in a negative ( positive ) term . when the focus is placed in the center of the medium ( @xmath49 ) , such as to maximize the drive laser intensity ,",
    "the value of @xmath50 becomes equal to zero .",
    "the terms described so far can now be used to calculate the spatial and temporal evolution of the harmonic field , as expressed in eq . .",
    "the instantaneous harmonic intensity of the @xmath19 harmonic at the exit of the medium is obtained from @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the speed of light and the vacuum permittivity respectively .",
    "the on - axis harmonic pulse energy of the @xmath19 harmonic , @xmath54 , can be obtained by temporal integration over the entire pulse and multiplying with a cross - sectional area , @xmath55 , @xmath56    the described model has been widely and successfully applied to analyze measurements of hhg under various experimental conditions such as guided - wave geometries  @xcite , or loose focusing geometries  @xcite . in the next section , we will use the model in its simplest form , namely , for the case of a homogeneous medium ( argon ) with a loosely focused drive laser beam . in detail",
    ", we will present the consequence of the time dependence in the wave - vector mismatch .",
    "in the case of a loose focusing geometry for hhg , the rayleigh range is chosen to be long , typically in the order of tens of millimeters such that it becomes much longer than the length of the medium ( @xmath57 ) . although",
    "loose focusing reduces the drive laser intensity , the advantage is that a large interaction volume can be provided for maximizing the total harmonic pulse energy .",
    "usually a relatively low gas pressure is required to maintain phase matching  @xcite . in this geometry",
    ", the drive laser intensity stays approximately constant along the entire generating medium .",
    "therefore , the harmonic dipole amplitude , @xmath14 , the interaction area , @xmath58 , and also the ionization fraction , @xmath38 , become space independent . due to the long rayleigh range",
    ", the geometry - induced wave - vector contribution can be simplified as @xmath59 and becomes independent of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the harmonic dipole phase contribution , @xmath50 , becomes much smaller than the other terms  @xcite and can be neglected . as a result",
    ", the total wave - vector mismatch can be regarded as a space - independent parameter , @xmath60 , such that the phase term , @xmath13 , in eq . can be simply represented as the product of @xmath60 and @xmath8 : @xmath61 here , the time - dependent coherence length , @xmath62 , is introduced for characterizing the wave - vector mismatch in comparison to other length parameters , specifically the length of the medium .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath63 is that the @xmath19 harmonic radiation generated at the end of this length is shifted out of phase with respect to the harmonic radiation generated at the beginning of the length .",
    "this leads to back conversion in further propagation , often also termed as destructive inteference . by implementing a time - dependent coherence length , eq .",

    "\\label{eq : anaylitical solution of high harmonic field}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in this expression , reabsorption of harmonic radiation is taken into account via an absorption length , @xmath65 . from eq .",
    "it can be seen that , ideally , the maximum harmonic output can be obtained when perfect phase matching is achieved , namely , @xmath66 ( equivalent to an infinitely long coherence length ) during the entire drive laser pulse . in particular , when absorption is neglected ( infinitely long absorption length ) the harmonic intensity would grow proportionally to the square of the medium length . for the experimentally more relevant case",
    "that phase matching is not ideally fulfilled ( @xmath67 ) and can be approximated by a temporally constant and finite coherence length , i.e. , when the ionization fraction does not change much vs. time , and when additionally absorption can not be neglected , a coarse criterion , @xmath68 , has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "if this criterion is fulfilled , the harmonics are efficiently generated and the output is mainly limited by reabsorption .",
    "quantitatively , for instance , when @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the harmonic intensity reaches more than half of the maximum intensity of the ideal case ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) . however , when generating high - order harmonics with an increased intensity and appreciable gas density , the named criterion becomes inapplicable because the coherence length becomes markedly . in that case , the coherence length varies strongly on an ultrafast time scale due to a dramatic change of the ionization fraction of the medium during the drive pulse .",
    "therefore , phase matching is only achieved in a very short time interval during the drive pulse . as a result , for obtaining a maximum harmonic output pulse energy",
    ", it remains questionable to what fraction and at what instance during the drive laser pulse the criterion should be fulfilled .",
    "a further complication is that the harmonic dipole amplitude , @xmath73 , is also a time - dependent parameter that will influence the hh output .",
    "for instance , even if the above length criterion is fulfilled for a certain time interval , the output pulse energy may still be far below optimum if @xmath74 is small during that interval .    in view of these effects and to translate them properly into a situation aiming for quasi - phase matching in sec .",

    "specifically , starting from a certain mismatch , there is first a rapid increase of @xmath63 in some part of the leading edge of the drive laser pulse .",
    "initially , the dispersion of free electrons due to the negligible ionization fraction is relatively small , and the other terms in eq .",
    "however , with the increase of the drive laser intensity , the ionization fraction rapidly increases further .",
    "consequently , the dispersion in the plasma due to the accumulation of free electrons overwhelms the other terms in eq .",
    ", resulting in a quick drop of the coherence length .",
    "the short duration of the peak in the coherence length leaves only an extremely short interval ( a few femtoseconds long ) where the dispersion is close to zero ( phase matching ) .",

    "[ fig : coherence length for 21st hh and 39th hh ] ( a ) ) , the time interval of phase matched generation is indicated by the red area .",
    "this interval is found in the leading edge of the drive laser pulse ( where the criterion @xmath85 , is fulfilled ) .",

    "[ fig : coherence length for 21st hh and 39th hh ] ( b ) ) , the coherence length reaches a very large value and also becomes longer than the length of the medium in a short time interval at the leading edge of the pulse ( red area ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the @xmath75 harmonic , this interval is located outside the time interval in which the @xmath77 harmonic can be generated ( green area , where @xmath86 ) .",
    "thus , the red ( phase matching ) and green ( generation ) intervals do not overlap , which indicates that the ionization fraction induced by the minimum required drive laser intensity for generating the @xmath77 harmonic is too high for phase matching .",

    "this observation shows that the harmonic is efficiently generated and only limited by reabsorption .",
    "on the other hand , the output pulse energy of the @xmath77 harmonic ( red curve , multiplied by 5000 in order to be visible in the graph ) does not show any obvious growth with the length of the medium and is ( beyond @xmath90 ) approximately four to five orders of magnitude weaker .",
    "a few oscillations can be seen along the length of the medium , which is due to varying levels of destructive interference .    from a series of additional calculations ,",

    "this allows for harmonic generation that is limited only by absorption .",
    "however , for harmonics of @xmath91 ( such as in the example above , @xmath92 ) , the criterion can never be fulfilled at any instance during the drive laser pulse , which leads to a generation efficiency that is decreased by many orders of magnitude .",

    "this is due to a larger number of neutral atoms contributing to the hhg in the leading edge of the pulse than that in the trailing edge , because the ionization fraction reduces the neutral atomic density .",
    "the results above show that choosing a particular modulation period only maximizes the hh output for a certain temporal fraction of the drive laser pulse , but , that also at other time intervals there is output , particularly in the leading edge . in an experiment , however , one is usually observing the hh pulse energy , while the instantaneous hh intensity is rather difficult to monitor  @xcite . to optimize the pulse energy , @xmath155",
    ", we integrate the instantaneous harmonic intensity , @xmath156 , over the entire drive laser pulse and vary the modulation period .",

    "generally a modulation period has been selected that is equal to the sum of the coherence lengths calculated for high - density and low - density regions at the time that the drive laser pulse reaches the peak intensity .",
    "the motivation for such choice was that at that time the highest harmonic dipole amplitude , @xmath154 , can be achieved  @xcite .",

    "the optimum modulation period for the highest on - axis hh pulse energy , @xmath126 , can only be approximately be determined from the remaining wave - vector mismatch at the peak of the drive laser pulse .",
    "although at this time the highest instantaneous output intensity is reached and even higher output is expected with larger qpm period .",

    "this is due to strong ionization driven by the need for high intensities and therefore leading to an ultrafast dependence of the coherence length .",

    "we show that simply choosing the modulation period to provide phase matching at the peak intensity of the pulse , when the highest amplitude of the nonlinearly induced high - order harmonic dipole amplitude is reached , does not provide the highest harmonic output pulse energy . to find the optimum modulation period , it is essential to analyze the time dependence of the wave - vector mismatch and the harmonic dipole amplitude along the entire pulse duration . according to our model , the optimal modulation is obtained with longer periods than usually assumed , such that transient quasi - phase matching is provided in the leading edge of the pulse .",
    "although we have presented results from the model using a specific choice of parameters for an idealized situation , we note that the model can also be applied to more complicated modulation profiles such as would be present e.g. , in a density modulated cluster jet .",
    "the model may also be applied to more complicated gas distributions such as multi dual - gas jet arrays  @xcite , by recalculating the wave - vector mismatch and the induced dipole amplitudes for the different gas species used .",
