    "this is the second part of our eight presentations in which we consider applications of methods from wavelet analysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems .",
    "this is a continuation of our results from [ 1]-[8 ] , which is based on our approach to investigation of nonlinear problems  general , with additional structures ( hamiltonian , symplectic or quasicomplex ) , chaotic , quasiclassical , quantum , which are considered in the framework of local ( nonlinear ) fourier analysis , or wavelet analysis .",
    "wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods , which gives us a possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and with the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases .",
    "in this part we consider orbital motion in transverse plane for a single particle in a circular magnetic lattice in case when we take into account multipolar expansion up to an arbitrary finite number .",
    "we reduce initial dynamical problem to the finite number ( equal to the number of n - poles ) of standard algebraical problem and represent all dynamical variables as expansion in the base of periodical wavelet functions .",
    "our consideration is based on generalization of variational wavelet approach from part 1 . after introducing our starting points related to multiresolution in section 3",
    ", we consider methods which allow us to construct wavelet representation for solution in periodic case in section 4 .",
    "the magnetic vector potential of a magnet with @xmath0 poles in cartesian coordinates is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a homogeneous function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 of order @xmath5 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of binomial expansion of @xmath6 correspond to regular and skew multipoles .",
    "the cases @xmath7 to @xmath8 correspond to low - order multipoles : quadrupole , sextupole , octupole , decapole .",
    "then we have in particular case the following equations of motion for single particle in a circular magnetic lattice in the transverse plane @xmath9 ( [ 9 ] for designation ) : @xmath10,\\\\ & & \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^2y}{{\\mathrm{d}}s^2}+k_1(s)y=\\nonumber\\\\ & & -{\\cal j}m\\left[\\sum_{n\\geq } \\frac{k_n(s)+ij_n(s)}{n!}\\cdot(x+iy)^n\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the corresponding hamiltonian : @xmath11\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we may take into account arbitrary but finite number in expansion of rhs of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) and from our point of view the corresponding hamiltonian equations of motions are not more than nonlinear ordinary differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities and variable coefficients .",
    "our constructions are based on multiresolution approach .",
    "because affine group of translation and dilations is inside the approach , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of spaces .",
    "more exactly , the closed subspace @xmath12 corresponds to level j of resolution , or to scale j. we consider a r - regular multiresolution analysis ( mra ) of @xmath13 ( of course , we may consider any different functional space ) which is a sequence of increasing closed subspaces @xmath14 : @xmath15 satisfying the following properties : @xmath16 there exists a function @xmath17 such that \\{@xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 } forms a riesz basis for @xmath21 .",
    "the function @xmath22 is regular and localized : @xmath22 is @xmath23 ,  @xmath24 is almost everywhere differentiable and for almost every @xmath25 , for every integer @xmath26 and for all integer p there exists constant @xmath27 such that @xmath28 let @xmath29 be a scaling function , @xmath30 is a wavelet function and @xmath31 . scaling relations that define @xmath32",
    "are @xmath33 let indices @xmath34 represent translation and scaling , respectively and @xmath35 then the set @xmath36 forms a riesz basis for @xmath14 .",
    "the wavelet function @xmath37 is used to encode the details between two successive levels of approximation .",
    "let @xmath38 be the orthonormal complement of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath39 : @xmath40 then just as @xmath14 is spanned by dilation and translations of the scaling function , so are @xmath38 spanned by translations and dilation of the mother wavelet @xmath41 , where @xmath42 all expansions which we used are based on the following properties : @xmath43 fig.1 and fig.2 give the representation of some function and corresponding mra on each level of resolution .",
    "we start with extension of our approach from part 1 to the case of periodic trajectories .",
    "the equations of motion corresponding to hamiltonian ( 4 ) may also be formulated as a particular case of the general system of ordinary differential equations @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are not more than polynomial functions of dynamical variables @xmath48 and have arbitrary dependence of time but with periodic boundary conditions . according to our variational approach from part 1 we have the solution in the following form @xmath49 where @xmath50 are again the roots of reduced algebraical systems of equations with the same degree of nonlinearity and @xmath51 corresponds to useful type of wavelet bases ( frames ) .",
    "it should be noted that coefficients of reduced algebraical system are the solutions of additional linear problem and also depend on particular type of wavelet construction and type of bases .",
    "this linear problem is our second reduced algebraical problem .",
    "we need to find in general situation objects @xmath52 but now in the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "now we consider the procedure of their calculations in case of periodic boundary conditions in the base of periodic wavelet functions on the interval [ 0,1 ] and corresponding expansion ( 14 ) inside our variational approach .",
    "periodization procedure gives us @xmath53 so , @xmath54 are periodic functions on the interval [ 0,1 ] . because @xmath55 if @xmath56 , we may consider only @xmath57 and as consequence our multiresolution has the form @xmath58 $ ] with @xmath59 [ 10 ] .",
    "integration by parts and periodicity gives useful relations between objects ( 15 ) in particular quadratic case @xmath60 : @xmath61 so , any 2-tuple can be represent by @xmath62 .",
    "then our second additional linear problem is reduced to the eigenvalue problem for @xmath63 by creating a system of @xmath64 homogeneous relations in @xmath62 and inhomogeneous equations .",
    "so , if we have dilation equation in the form @xmath65 , then we have the following homogeneous relations @xmath66 or in such form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "inhomogeneous equations are : @xmath69 where objects @xmath70 can be computed by recursive procedure @xmath71 so , we reduced our last problem to standard linear algebraical problem .",
    "then we use the same methods as in part 1 . as a result we obtained for closed trajectories of orbital dynamics described by hamiltonian ( 4 ) the explicit time solution ( 14 ) in the base of periodized wavelets ( 16 ) .",
