    "in recent years one - dimensional quantum systems have attracted great interest as building blocks for future molecular electronics devices .",
    "besides proposed applications , there is also a fundamental interest in these systems , because as the size is reduced down to the nanoscale a description at the quantum level is necessary to account for most of the properties of the material .",
    "carbon nanotubes are certainly the most studied one - dimensional quantum systems . however , the dependence of their electronic properties on their diameter and on their chirality -  and the difficulty of controlling such properties during growth  - might make them an impractical choice for nanodevice engineering .",
    "semiconductor nanowires seem to obviate such an inconvenient and they are becoming the focus of a growing research interest .",
    "silicon nanowires  ( sinws ) are an especially appealing choice , as they offer the best possible interface with conventional silicon - based microelectronics .",
    "sinws have been successfully doped with both _",
    "n_- and _ p_-type impurities  @xcite and nanoscale logic devices have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "a growing research interest has been devoted to the synthesis of sinw - based heterostructures -  oriented to optoelectronics applications  @xcite , as well to device fabrication  @xcite  - and to the use of sinws as chemical sensors  @xcite . at present , diameters around 100  nm thick can be almost routinely obtained and a few examples of sinws below 10  nm have been published  @xcite , being 1.5  nm the thinnest wire s diameter reported so far  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , at first the attention was directed to the structure of the thinnest possible sinws .",
    "hollow structures  @xcite and systems ranging from atomic wires to silicon cluster aggregates have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , a wealth of experimental results  @xcite soon showed that realistic sinws present a well - defined diamond - like bulk core . since then , significant efforts have been devoted to the modeling of hydrogen - passivated sinws  @xcite , _ i.e. _ wires where the lateral surface dangling bonds are terminated with hydrogens .",
    "these are extremely interesting systems for theoretical modeling for different reasons : ( a ) the absence of surface states allows an easier approach to the study of all the features related to quantum confinement  @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ the energy band - gap is well - defined and depends only on the growth direction and on the wire diameter ; ( b ) it is a good approach to realistic experimental conditions where different kinds of polluting agents , _ e.g. _ hydrogen  @xcite , oxygen  @xcite , are present and can react with the surface dangling bonds .",
    "however , studying the surface physics of these low - dimensional systems without passivation is of great interest because of the subtle interplay between an unusually large surface - to - bulk ratio and the effect of quantum confinement . in a previous publication  @xcite",
    "we have shown that in the absence of passivation , the lateral surface of a @xmath2 sinw undergoes a strong reconstruction which can turn the wire into metallic .",
    "the conductive surface states form at the \\{100 } facets of the wire , at variance with the infinite si(100 ) surface which is known to be semiconducting . therefore",
    ", the diameter of the sinw must play a very crucial role in the determination of the surface electronic structure .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the diameter dependence of the surface reconstruction and of the associated electronic structure @xmath3 sinws and we extend our study to wires grown along the @xmath1 direction .",
    "we have performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , in the framework of the generalized gradient approximation  ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "we have used both numerical atomic orbital  @xcite and plane - wave methods  @xcite , combined with norm - conserving pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins type  @xcite and with ultrasoft pseudopotentials , respectively .",
    "we have used a double-@xmath4 polarized basis set  @xcite and a plane - wave cutoff of 20  ry for the one - electron wave function of the valence electrons .",
    "all the calculations use periodic boundary conditions , thus the supercell size may restrict the number of observed reconstructions . for this reason , to explore a larger set of the phase space of the surface reconstruction we have also used a non - orthogonal tight - binding model  @xcite to treat system sizes that can not efficiently be managed within dft . even in the cases",
    "when the tb surface electronic structure turned out to be only qualitatively accurate , the minimum energy geometries proved to be very close to those obtained by dft .",
    "in all the calculations discussed , the atomic positions have been relaxed until the maximum force was lower than 0.04  ev /  .",
    "we have studied wires grown along the @xmath2 direction of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8    and wires grown along the @xmath1 direction of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11   , being the @xmath5 and @xmath9    the thinnest possible wires with a bulk core of each growth orientation . for each diameter",
    "considered we have carried out calculations with up to four unit cells of the unreconstructed wire .",
    "the systems with the largest number of atoms ( large diameter , many unit cells ) have been only calculated with tb .",
    "the reciprocal space has been sampled with a converged number of _",
    "k_-points , ranging from 1 to 12 , depending on the size of the unit cell in direct space .",
    "after converging the atomic positions , we have recalculated the electronic structure with a three times thicker mesh of _ k_-points and an _ electronic temperature _ approaching zero , in order to obtain a highly accurate band diagram , especially for what concerns the crossings of the fermi level .",
    "the first issue to deal with is the shape of the wire s cross - section .",
    "although we restrict to a specific growth direction , different sections are possible .",
    "we have discussed this topic elsewhere  @xcite , concluding that @xmath2 sinws favor the formation of \\{100 } facets . on the other hand",
    ", we found that it is not clear if , at such small diameters , smoothing sharp angles increases or not the stability  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the role of the edges can also be found in the work by zhao and yakobson  @xcite or by ismail - beigi and arias  @xcite . throughout this article",
    ", we will focus our attention on wires with smooth angles [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:100_thin_sec ] ( a - c ) ] , even though most of the conclusions could be generalized to the case of wires with a square section ( see ref .   for a complete discussion ) .",
    "the first @xmath2 sinw that we have analyzed has a diameter of @xmath5   .",
    "this size is well below the diameter of the thinnest sinw grown so far ( @xmath7   , see ref .  ) , however , it can be a useful case study to elucidate the atomic scale mechanisms that are capable of inducing a metallic state at the wire s surface .",
    "we have found one only stable reconstruction which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:100_8_relax_side ] .",
    "it is characterized by one row of si dimers along the _ z_-axis .",
    "the formation of si dimers on the \\{100 } facets is a feature common to @xmath2 sinws   and is one of the characteristic reconstruction patterns of the infinite si(100 ) surface .    the band structure diagram , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:100_8_relax_side ] , presents two states at the fermi energy .",
    "it is well - known that dft , though giving the correct dispersion of bands , underestimates band - gaps .",
    "therefore , especially in the case of marginal crossings of the fermi level it is difficult to guarantee the metallicity of the system .",
    "an accurate band - gap estimation can be obtained within the gw approximation ( see for instance ref .  , where the effect of quantum confinement in semiconducting sinws is studied ) . for the purpose of the present work",
    ", the gap _ renormalization _ can be modeled with a scissor operator which rigidly shifts upward / downward the states above / below a certain energy . in the present case",
    "we can not exclude that the proper scissor operator would open a small gap between the two states that in dft electronic structure crosses the fermi level , in such a way that the 8    sinw would rather be a small - gap semiconductor  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the band - widening effect of hydrogen - passivated wires , we notice that reconstructed wires present a reduction of the band gap as compared to the bulk value .",
    "the most stable reconstruction that we have found for the @xmath12",
    "   wire is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:100_8_relax_side](a )  @xcite .",
    "it follows the same pattern of the previous wire , featuring one - single row of dimers .",
    "the differences between these two cases are better understood looking at fig .",
    "[ fig:100_thin_sec](a - c ) , where the unrelaxed geometries are displayed .",
    "the thinnest wire can form one only row of dimers , involving all of the surface atoms of the \\{100 } facet [ panel ( a ) ] .",
    "the @xmath6    sinw can also form one only row of dimers , but it leaves one unpaired row of si atoms [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "this has two notable effects : it results in a much more asymmetric in - plane relaxation [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:100_thin_sec](b ) ] and leaves a higher density of dangling bonds .",
    "the effects are clearly visible also in the side view of fig .",
    "[ fig:100_8_relax_side ] and [ fig:100_11_relax_side ] .",
    "the asymmetry in the relaxation originates from the high reactivity of the surface atoms of the unpaired row .",
    "these atoms can not form dimers , but their double dangling bonds would make the system unstable .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:100_11_relax ] : the gray atom ( indicated with an arrow ) eliminate one dangling bond by breaking a si - si subsurface bond ( red atoms , also indicated with a circle in the picture ) and _ entering _ it .",
    "the golden atoms ( indicated with a cross in the picture ) therein are strictly equivalent to the gray atom , but they can combine and form a dimer , according to the conventional mechanism of si(100 ) surfaces .    the next @xmath2 sinw that we analyze has already been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . in this case the diameter ( @xmath13   ) starts to be sufficiently thick to permit to distinguish clearly between a bulk region , consisting of atoms tetra - coordinated , and a surface region , consisting of atoms with lower coordination : the surface region is the one where the reconstruction occurs , while in the bulk region the atoms maintain the ideal position of the si lattice .    in ref .",
    "we have shown that this wire sustains two different competing reconstructions , which only differ by 3  mev / atom .",
    "while one of them is strongly metallic , with four bands crossing the fermi level , the other is at most semi - metallic . in this case",
    "the assignment of a metallic character , at least to one of the two stable phases , is robust against failures of dft , because two of the four metallic states are degenerate and thus can not be shifted by a scissor operator without violating correct electron counting  @xcite .",
    "this opens up a fundamental question : how can surface states of a \\{100 } facet be metallic , while the analogous reconstruction of the si(100 ) surface is semiconducting ? in fig .",
    "[ fig : facet_surf ] we show a top view of the @xmath14 reconstruction of the si(100 ) surface ; it can be seen that by _ cutting _ a strip out of it , one recovers the metallic reconstruction of the \\{100 } facet ( the one referred to as _",
    "symmetric _ in ref .  ) .",
    "however , the coordination of the boundary dimers change , because they now miss one of the _ rest _ atoms ( some of them are indicated with an arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : facet_surf ] ) .",
    "this in turn alters the packing density of the surface dimers , especially in the case of a nanometric size sinw where _ all _ dimers are at the facet boundary . as the diameter of the wire",
    "is increased , a growing number of dimer rows will recover the coordination that they have on the si(100 ) surface .",
    "hence , when the fraction of dimers at the facet boundary becomes negligible a semiconducting behavior is expected .",
    "the thicker @xmath2 sinw that we have studied has a diameter of approximately 27   . up to this point",
    "we have distinguished between wires that have an even or an odd number of rows of dangling bonds in the \\{100 } facets , because the different way of reducing the number of dangling bonds , i.e. forming dimers or through the mechanisms of fig .",
    "[ fig:100_11_relax ] , proved to be the most prominent factor ruling the reconstruction . in the wires discussed",
    "so far the dimers formed on the facet were characterized by an altered packing density ( the mechanism is illustrated schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : facet_surf ] ) , which ultimately results in the metalization . in this wire three row of dimers",
    "are formed on each \\{100 } facet , so it is the first among the sinws that we have considered that features at least one row of dimers which has the same nearest - neighbor coordination than the infinite si(100 ) surface .",
    "this situation is revealed by the band structure of fig .",
    "[ fig:100_15 - 27_bands ] where , though still being metallic , the band - gap starts opening , as can be seen by comparison with the 15    wire  @xcite .",
    "another evidence of the size effect can be appreciated in the side panels of the same figure .",
    "there , we have plotted the wave function of the lower metallic state .",
    "it can be seen that the overlap between surface dangling bonds decreases for the larger diameter , indicating a higher localization of the surface state .",
    "@xmath15    summarizing , the metalization of @xmath2 sinws is due to the partial distortion of the si dimers on the \\{100 } facets which alters the overall packing density respect to the infinite si(100 ) surface . when the fraction of dimers with the same coordination of the infinite surface increases , _",
    "i.e _ when the si(100 ) packing density is recovered , the sinw develops a semiconducting character .      in the case of @xmath1",
    "sinws the shape of the wire section is automatically defined by the hexagonal symmetry of the [ 110 ] plain of bulk si .",
    "the hexagonal shape of the section of @xmath1 sinws has been also confirmed unambiguously by scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite and transmission electron microscopy  @xcite images .",
    "it should be stressed that in this case , contrary to @xmath16 sinws , the angles between vicinal facets are intrinsically smooth .",
    "hence , the only issue concerning the cross - section consists in choosing between two possible configurations , shown in fig .  [ fig:110_top_geometries ] : one with rings of hexagons organized around a single hexagonal channel and another without the central hexagon .",
    "the tests that we have performed indicated that the arrangement in fig .",
    "[ fig:110_top_geometries](b ) is favored .",
    "therefore , this is the pattern that we have adopted to generate sinws with growing diameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig:110_top_unrelax ] ) . in these sinws",
    "the unrelaxed lateral surface is made up of \\{111 } and \\{110 } facets .",
    "therefore , the competition mechanism that rule the reconstruction is expected to be markedly different to the case of @xmath2 wires .",
    "the thinnest @xmath1 sinw that we have studied turns out to have two competing reconstructions , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:110_12ang_2phases_side ] . after the relaxation",
    "it is hardly possible to still distinguish facets with a well - defined crystallographic orientation [ see the top view of fig .",
    "[ fig:110_top_unrelax](d ) ] .",
    "the difference between to the reconstructions found emerges at the \\{111}-like facets , where the periodicity of the protruding atoms change , as it can be observed in the space - fill representation of fig .",
    "[ fig:110_12ang_2phases_side ] .",
    "the difference in energy is negligible , so that both reconstructions are expected to occur with the same probability .",
    "most important , both phases are semiconducting with a small band - gap , approximately one third of its bulk value .",
    "the @xmath10    has similar features .",
    "it presents two reconstructions with a level of stability of the same order ( the difference is around 3  mev / atom ) . in this case too , the rows of protruding atoms can arrange in different ways : one single row in the case of the reconstruction with the smallest motif ; a second row which alternates protruding to non - protruding atoms in the other reconstruction .",
    "contrary to some of the cases described in sec .",
    "[ sub:100 ] , the differences in the reconstruction alter only marginally the band structure and a semiconducting character can be safely attributed to both phases .    curiously , it turns out that the number of protruding atoms is always a constant . in the smallest reconstruction [ fig .",
    "[ fig:110_20ang_2phases_side](a ) ] none of the atoms protrude outward , while all of them do in the opposite facet ( not shown here ) .",
    "the opposite point of view was chosen for the unit - cell reconstruction of fig .",
    "[ fig:110_12ang_2phases_side](a ) , where all the atoms are protruding outward , while none of them does in the opposite facet . in the same way , the more varied motif of the extended reconstructions of fig .  [ fig:110_12ang_2phases_side](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:110_20ang_2phases_side](b ) is echoed in the opposite facet , where a depressed atom corresponds to a protruding atom and viceversa .",
    "the largest @xmath1 sinw that we have analyzed has a diameter of @xmath11   .",
    "a significant difference with the thinner wires described here , is that the diameter has reached a critical size so that not only \\{111 } , but also \\{110 } facets are present .",
    "the latter reconstructs forming a long trough all along the wire axis , while the \\{111 } have a patter similar to those seen so far , with a row of protruding atoms .    a common feature that clearly emerges is that , although there is a dependence of the band - gap size on the wire diameter , in none of the @xmath1 sinws that we have studied the facet reconstruction gives rise to surface metallic states like in the case of wires grown along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "from the discussion of the results it appears that these wires are dominated by \\{111 } facets and \\{110 } facets form only on thick wires .",
    "the found geometries -  and their semiconducting character  - agree with the @xmath17-bonded chain model typical of the @xmath18 reconstruction of the si(111 ) surface  @xcite .",
    "the unreconstructed surface ( the facet in the case of the wire ) features one dangling bond per atom and the system spontaneously reduces its symmetry to lower the energy of the half - occupied states .",
    "this is possible because the surface dangling bonds reside on nearest - neighbor atoms and the bond - orbitals are close enough to interact significantly stabilizing the surface and introducing a band - gap between occupied and unoccupied states  @xcite .",
    "other reconstructions , notably the @xmath19 , are known to be metallic due to the presence of adatoms that have not been considered in the present study .",
    "adatoms could lead to metallic -  and possibly more stable  - phases also in the case of nanowire facets and their influence on the electronic and geometrical structure of the reconstruction should be addressed . however , under a certain diameter the facets are not large enough to host such extended reconstructions , but the existence of adatom phases can not be ruled out .    further insight on the mechanisms that rule the surface physics of these wires can be obtained from the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : surf_en ] . in the left panel",
    "we have plotted the energy gained with the relaxation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the total energies of the reconstructed and unreconstructed geometry ( shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:100_thin_sec ] and [ fig:110_top_unrelax ] ) of a wire of @xmath23 atoms .",
    "the first thing to observe is that with the relaxation @xmath1 wires lower their energy less than @xmath2 .",
    "this is in agreement with the reconstruction mechanisms previously discussed : @xmath24 wires simply rearrange the topology of the surface dangling bonds to allow the formation of a @xmath17-bonded chain ; @xmath0 wires , on the other hand , go through a much stronger reconstruction of the facet , involving the formation of new bonds .",
    "both curves are fairly linear , with the remarkable exception of the 11   @xmath2 sinw . in the above discussion ( see sec .",
    "[ sub:100 ] ) we have suggested that facets of @xmath3 sinws with an even number of dangling bond rows should be favored . in the opposite case ( odd number of dangling bond rows , like the 11    wire ) , the system has to spend a larger amount of structural energy to readjust the facet geometry , because it can not form ordered rows of dimers . this intuitive idea is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : surf_en](a ) and becomes clearer by defining the surface energy as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the energy per atom of bulk si and @xmath27 and @xmath28 the number of bulk and surface atoms , respectively  @xcite . in this way , in the graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : surf_en](b ) we isolated pure surface contributions and the _ anomaly _ of the 11    wire emerges in a more evident way .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we discuss the cohesion energies defined as  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total energy of the wire , @xmath23 is the number of atoms and @xmath31 the energy of the isolated si atom .",
    "the cohesion energy  @xcite , being directly derived from the total energy , allows to compare the relative stabilities of the systems studied and which structures will be favored , in absence of other constraints , in the growth process .",
    "the smoother angle between vicinal facets favors @xmath1 growth orientation to the sharper angle of @xmath2 sinws .",
    "when the diameter increases the difference tends to disappear : @xmath2 wires reach a critical cross - section that allows to form smoother transition facets , while thick @xmath24 wires start to develop their own \\{100 } facets , which are expected to contribute with a surface energy very similar to the \\{100 } facets of the @xmath1 sinws .    @xmath15    summarizing , the @xmath1 sinws that we have analyzed turned out to be always semiconducting .",
    "the dangling bonds on the \\{111 } facets can not give rise to the formation of dimers because , due to the different symmetry of the cleavage , they are second neighbors . incidentally , if they could form dimers this would result in a complete passivation of the wire because each atom on the facet surface has only one dangling bond per atom .",
    "however , the dangling bonds are close enough to interact and to form a @xmath17-bonded chain typical of si(111 ) @xmath18 surfaces .",
    "we have performed first - principles electronic structure calculations to study the surface reconstructions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 of different diameters .",
    "sinws grown along the @xmath1 axis are dominated by \\{100 } facets that exhibit the typical reconstruction pattern of the si(100 ) surface , consisting in the formation of rows of buckled dimers . in the case of the thinner wires , the altered packing density of the facet dimers gives rise to delocalized surface states that result in a metalization of the surface .",
    "increasing the diameter , the coordination of the infinite si(100 ) is recovered .",
    "the largest @xmath2 sinw studied , though still metallic , gives a clear indication of a band - gap opening .",
    "the case of sinws grown along the @xmath1 axis is different . thanks to a different cross - section shape , the neighboring facets can match through a smooth angle and they are not significantly distorted with respect to their homologous infinite surfaces .",
    "hence , the \\{111 } facets that dominate the reconstruction follow the @xmath17-bonded chain model of si(111 ) surfaces , conferring to the wire a semiconducting character .",
    "the band - gaps are found to be smaller than the bulk value as an effect of the formation of the @xmath17-surface states , while as it is well - known , h - passivated wire of similar sizes result in widened gaps as a consequence of quantum confinement .",
    "analysis of the energetics of the wires indicates that at small diameters the growth of @xmath1 sinws is favored over @xmath2 sinws .",
