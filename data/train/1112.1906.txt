    "even more remarkably , although gravitational interactions are absent , the @xmath1 theory is intimately related to a supergravity theory via the celebrated ads / cft correspondence .",
    "multiloop @xmath1 scattering amplitudes are very elegantly studied within the on - shell superspace formalism @xcite . the principle is to arrange the entire supermultiplet as a superfield expanded in grassmann variables .",
    "all possible scattering combinations are realized by formation of superamplitudes , defined as generating functions of @xmath3 copies of superfields corresponding to the external legs .",
    "single amplitudes are then projected out by unique strings of grassmann differential operators or pieced together in a graphical framework .",

    "it is of course very interesting to examine features of the @xmath1 theory in more general settings .",
    "super yang - mills theories with less than maximal supersymmetry do not possess all of the amazing properties mentioned , although the superspace formalism can be generalized @xcite . however , exactly marginal deformations of the @xmath1 super yang - mills theory preserving only reduced amount of supersymmetry in particular inherit conformal invariance @xcite , and have recently attracted considerable attention especially catalyzed by the ads / cft duality .",

    "this lagrangian is manifestly @xmath4 supersymmetric being constructed using the @xmath4 superspace prescription .",
    "moreover , the three chiral superfields enjoy manifest @xmath65 flavor symmetry , but the full @xmath66 @xmath21-symmetry is obscured .",

    "the deformations break supersymmetry to @xmath4 .",
    "in order for the deformation to become exactly marginal and thereby inherit finiteness at the quantum level , the parameters must be highly constrained .",
    "leigh and strassler demonstrated the existence of a three - complex dimensional surface in the coupling constant space of conformally invariant theories with @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "this surface can be defined as a quite complicated level set @xmath70 .",
    "the condition however has to be calculated perturbatively and unfortunately its form is not known beyond few loops except for very restrictive choices of the couplings .",
    "the leigh - strassler deformed theory generated by the superpotential substitution includes as a special case a one - parameter family of theories known as @xmath0-deformations , which extend to quantum finiteness to all orders in the planar limit @xcite .",
    "the model follows by tightening the assumptions on the parameters and setting @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , so that for @xmath74 real , the new superpotential becomes @xmath75 whence the undeformed theory is recovered by sending @xmath76 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath0-deformation can be understood in terms of a special operation between the superfields , namely the star product , which will prove invaluable when we evaluate deformations of scattering amplitudes @xcite . in order to define the star product",

    ".    prior to implementation in the @xmath1 lagrangian the star product must extend to the antichiral superfields @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "several comments are important in this connection .",
    "the two theories have the same particle content and it is easy to see that many amplitudes are actually identical . for a @xmath0-deformed amplitude to agree with the corresponding @xmath1 expression , the phases of the @xmath0-dependent vertices should cancel each other , or such vertices should simply be absent in the diagram .",
    "whole classes of amplitudes are insensitive to the phase deformation , the most obvious being all tree - level amplitudes with external gluons and gluinos exclusively .    in general , amplitudes in the deformed theory are @xmath0-dependent .",
    "the modifications however turn out to be surprisingly uncomplicated . at first",
    "we realize that the original and deformed theories are equivalent at tree - level , up to a multiplicative prefactor .",
    "this conclusion follows from the simplicity of the color - ordered feynman vertices .",
    "but it can be shown that the product of phase factors from the individual vertices is independent of the internal structure of the diagram .",
    "suppose the arbitrary color - ordered tree - level amplitude in consideration has any combination of @xmath3 external fields and label them @xmath96 .",
    "then the @xmath0-dependence of this amplitude is entirely captured by @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "actually this statement applies not only to tree - level amplitudes , but is guaranteed to hold to all orders in perturbation theory in the planar limit .",
    "the claim has profound consequences for our applications of @xmath0-deformed super yang - mills theory .",
    "a proof based on effective vertices of only external legs was provided in @xcite .",
    "shortly we report a similar strategy for supervertices .",
    "we end this section by deriving an expression for the phase factor of any given @xmath3-point amplitude in terms of only the @xmath5 charges of the superfields corresponding to the external legs . upon invoking the definition of the star product",
    "we deduce the generalization to @xmath3 legs , @xmath98 } { { \\operatorname{tr}}\\left[\\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\cdots\\lambda_n\\right ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}\\exp\\bigg[i\\pi\\beta_r\\sum_{j = i+1}^n\\left ( q^{[1]}_{\\lambda_i}q^{[2]}_{\\lambda_j}- q^{[2]}_{\\lambda_i}q^{[1]}_{\\lambda_j}\\right)\\bigg]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the rather selfexplanatory notation with @xmath99 and @xmath100 denoting the symmetry charges of the field @xmath101 .",

    "now that we have gained confidence with the basic structure and interactions of @xmath0-deformed super yang - mills theory , it is very natural to attempt to incorporate all scattering amplitudes sectorwise into generating functions instead of relying on traditional feynman calculations .",
    "thereby established @xmath1 superspace applications such as intermediate state sums by grassmann integration become compatible with the @xmath0-deformed amplitudes .",
    "we first identify particles in @xmath1 on - shell superspace with the components of the @xmath4 vector and chiral superfields .",
    "recall that the sixteen physical states in the @xmath1 supermultiplet can be realized as two gluons @xmath23 and @xmath24 , four fermion pairs @xmath25 and @xmath26 , plus six real , self - dual scalars @xmath27 , all completely antisymmetric in the displayed fundamental @xmath66 indices .",
    "the gluons of course belong to the vector multiplet , while the remaining fermions and scalars of the theory can be chosen such that @xcite @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we consider the @xmath32 sector and derive an expression for the @xmath3-point tree - level @xmath32 generating function . with that result at hand",
    "the @xmath33 superamplitude will follow immediately from the fourier connection .",
    "clearly , both expressions should reduce to the original @xmath1 superamplitudes in the limit @xmath106 .",
    "the upshot of the preceding section was that the @xmath1 and @xmath0-deformed theories have identical planar sectors up to simple phase factors , which for any given amplitude to all orders in perturbation theory are determined by the configuration of its external legs and their @xmath5 symmetry charges according to .",
    "the logical solution is therefore to take the @xmath1 superamplitude and just attach to each component the appropriate phase factor .",
    "we remind ourselves that the @xmath1 @xmath32 superamplitude reads @xmath107 and therefore the task concentrates on translating the individual grassmann signatures to @xmath0-dependent expressions .",
    "we circumvent this obstacle by assigning @xmath5 charges to the fermionic coordinates of the @xmath1 on - shell superspace instead of the superfields such that the on - shell superspace version of the star product imitates the star product defined in @xmath4 superspace .",
    "this solution is closely related to the light cone superspace star product introduced in @xcite .",

    "more precisely @xmath110 carries charges @xmath108}_a$ ] and @xmath109}_a$ ] .",
    "the trick is now to construct a pair of differential operators to decode the @xmath35-patterns and thereby count symmetry charges .",
    "preferably the @xmath35-strings should be eigenstates of these operators , and the symmetry charges the corresponding eigenvalues . in order to achieve this",
    "we introduce the operator @xmath111}_i \\equiv \\sum_{a=1}^4 q^{[1,2]}_a\\eta_{ia}\\partial_{ia}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the two explicit components @xmath112}_i",

    "we see that the three spin factors corresponding to the chiral multiplets are now correlated through a phase matrix @xmath128 while the original fourth @xmath66 factor identified with the vector multiplet is left unchanged and can be separated out .",
    "hence , @xmath4 supersymmetry is manifest .",
    "the result also reflects that alternatively we could have considered a theory of the three chiral superfields with the appropriate phase dependent interactions and then have coupled the corresponding superspace structure to the bare @xmath4 @xmath32 superamplitude addressed in @xcite .",

    "what is more , a complete set of four distinct grassmann variables is also chargeless , which potentially reduces the extent of nestedness even further .",

    "the deformed supercut provides rich information about non - planar diagrams which will differ substantially from the large-@xmath197 limit .",
    "beautiful algebraic and graphical methods for evaluating such supersums were reported in @xcite .",
    "these techniques rely merely on the grassmann structure of the amplitudes and are hence directly compatible with our results .",
    "the reader is encouraged to also consult @xcite .",
    "the remarkable properties of amplitudes in conformal deformations of @xmath1 super yang - mills theory with minimal or no supersymmetry suggest that neither the ordinary or dual representations of the superconformal algebras are really natural frameworks for discussing their symmetries . in the following we therefore propose a novel phase representation of the @xmath198 algebra .",

    "the phase generator has a perfectly well - defined and very simple inverse given by @xmath201}{\\hat{{\\mathcal}{q}}}_q^{[2]}- { \\hat{{\\mathcal}{q}}}_p^{[2]}{\\hat{{\\mathcal}{q}}}_q^{[1]}\\right)\\bigg]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our phase representation is therefore @xmath202    the transformed operators trivially satisfy the correct commutator and anti - commutator relations of the @xmath1 superconformal algebra by construction , irrespective of @xmath203 $ ] being nonzero .",
    "moreover , if @xmath204 is a symmetry of @xmath205 , that is @xmath206 , then @xmath207 in words , the deformed generating trees are manifestly annihilated by all @xmath198 generators in this phase representation .",
    "what is more , we can also apply the transformation to level one generators and hence lift the @xmath198 symmetry algebra to a yangian realized on the deformed amplitudes .",
    "our discussion thus suggests that all intrinsic properties of planar @xmath1 super yang - mills theory are preserved by the phase deformation .",
    "we emphasize that our formalism extends almost effortlessly to the @xmath2-deformation , of which the @xmath0-deformation is actually a more frequently studied special case .",
    "it is also conformally invariant at the quantum level in the planar approximation and can be defined analogously @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath2-deformation is generated by promoting ordinary products in the @xmath1 lagrangian to star products adjusted with phases which now break the @xmath20 @xmath21-symmetry to its cartan subgroup , which is a @xmath208 flavor symmetry of the resulting theory .",
    "customarily the star product between superfields @xmath209 and @xmath210 is @xmath211 for some basis @xmath212 .",

    "the number of independent parameters is thus three since the charges enter the star product antisymmetrically . on the other hand , if the vector multiplet is neutral , @xmath213}_4 = { \\mathcal}u^{[2]}_4 = 0 $ ]",
    ", we recover the one - parameter @xmath0-deformation .",
    "conservation of charge under each symmetry again implies absense of phase contributions from internal structure to all orders in planar perturbation theory .",
    "it is now trivial to write down the appropriate phase generator @xmath215}\\hat{{\\mathcal}u}_q^{[2]}- \\hat{{\\mathcal}u}_p^{[2]}\\hat{{\\mathcal}u}_q^{[1]}\\bigg)\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with charge counting operators defined in on - shell superspace in the usual way .",
    "the extracted parameter @xmath74 is a reminiscence of the @xmath0-deformation and should just be considered a fixed common constant of proportionality .",
    "we can now easily derive all tree - level amplitudes , super vertex expansions , multi - loop unitarity cuts and so forth .",
    "in other words , everything we have said about the @xmath0-deformation is compatible with the @xmath2-deformation .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the perturbative regime of @xmath0-deformed super yang - mills theory using on - shell methods .",
    "we have explicitly written all mhv and nmhv tree - level scattering amplitudes in terms of new generating functions and proven generalization to arbitrary particle and helicity configurations via the mhv vertex expansion .",
    "our results have been obtained by implementation of a phase matrix in the @xmath1 superamplitudes , derived from their grassmann structure using a sector independent operator .",
    "several component amplitudes were given as examples .",
    "all generating trees are manifestly @xmath4 supersymmetric and reduce to the usual maximally supersymmetric expressions when the deformation is removed . however , we transformed the @xmath1 superconformal generators in on - shell superspace and uncovered a phase dependent representation that annihilates the deformed amplitudes . in this implementation ,",
