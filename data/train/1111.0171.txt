    "the @xmath3cdm ( or _ concordance _ ) model @xcite is one of the greatest successes of general relativity .",
    "it reproduces beautifully all the main observational results e.g. , the dimming of type ia supernovae @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropies @xcite , large scale structure formation @xcite , baryon oscillations @xcite and weak lensing @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , this model is also affected by significant fine - tuning problems related to the vacuum energy scale and this has led to a considerable amount of effort throughly exploring other viable theoretical schemes .    currently , one of the most popular alternatives to the @xmath3cdm model is based on gravitational actions which are non - linear in the ricci curvature @xmath4 and/or contain terms involving combinations of derivatives of @xmath4 : the so called @xmath0 theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "such models first became popular in the 1980 s because it was shown that they can be derived from fundamental physical theories ( like m - theory ) and naturally admit a phase of accelerated expansion , which could be associated with an early universe inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "the fact that the phenomenology of dark energy requires the presence of a similar phase ( although only a late time - low energy one ) has recently revived interest in these models .",
    "in particular , the idea that dark energy may have a geometrical origin , i.e. , that there is a connection between dark energy and a non - standard behavior of gravitation on cosmological scales is now a very active area of research ( see for example @xcite ) .    unfortunately efforts to obtain an understanding of the physics of these theories are hampered by the complexity of the fourth - order field equations , making it difficult to obtain both exact and numerical solutions , which can be compared with observations .",
    "recently however , progress has been made in resolving these issues using a number of useful techniques .",
    "one such method , based on the theory of dynamical systems @xcite has proven to be very successful in providing a simple way of obtaining exact solutions and a ( qualitative ) description of the global dynamics of these models @xcite . the dynamical systems analysis has up to now approached this problem in the conventional way , by first exploring the finite equilibrium points and then computing the asymptotic behavior of the phase - space using the classical method of poincare projections .    in this paper",
    "we develop an alternative scheme which involves compactifying the phase space for general @xmath0 theories of gravity , subject to certain conditions on the function @xmath1 .",
    "we then use this framework to study the behaviour of the phase space of universes with a non - negative ricci scalar in @xmath2 gravity .",
    "we find a number of interesting cosmological evolutions , which include the possibility , at least in principle , where the universe begins close to at an unstable power - law inflationary equilibrium point , then evolves towards a curvature fluid dominated phase where the effective equation of state mimics standard radiation with @xmath5 ( we will refer to such phases as radiation - like ) , then passes through a standard matter ( cdm ) era and ultimately evolves asymptotically towards a de - sitter - like late - time accelerated phase .",
    "we also show that as @xmath6 , all the fixed points that approach the @xmath3cdm subspace of the complete state space of @xmath2 gravity , are unstable .",
    "this implies that the behavior of the solutions of a fourth order theory which is close to @xmath3cdm may be completely different from those of @xmath3cdm and one needs to do a careful analysis of the solutions rather than a priori assuming any global behavior of the trajectories .",
    "the natural extension of standard general relativity is to consider a lagrangian that contains curvature invariants of higher than linear order .",
    "in fact , renormalization of quantum field theory suggests that adding such terms to the standard gravitational action appears to be necessary @xcite to give a first approximation to some quantized theory of gravity .",
    "the quadratic lagrangians are at the first level of such modifications and have been studied extensively over true past two decades .",
    "the four possible second - order curvature invariants are @xmath7 where @xmath8 is completely antisymmetric 4-volume element and @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the ricci scalar , ricci tensor and riemann tensor respectively . however , for homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes , because of the following identities @xcite @xmath11 it follows that the general fourth - order lagrangian for a these highly symmetric spacetimes contain only powers of @xmath4 and we can write the action as = 12 d^4x , [ action ] where @xmath12 represents the matter contribution .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric gives the following field equations : f g_ab = t^m_ab+ 12 ( f - rf ) g_ab + _",
    "b_af- g_ab_c^cf , [ field1 ] where @xmath13 denotes the derivative of the function @xmath1 w.r.t .",
    "the ricci scalar and @xmath14 is the matter stress energy tensor defined by t^m_ab = ^mu_au_b + p^mh_ab+ q^m_au_b+ q^m_bu_a+^m_ab . here @xmath15 is the direction of a timelike observer , @xmath16 is the projected metric on the 3-space perpendicular to @xmath15 . also @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the standard matter density , pressure , heat flux and anisotropic stress respectively .",
    "equations ( [ field1 ] ) reduce to the standard einstein field equations when @xmath21 .    for the homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with vanishing 3-curvature and barotropic perfect fluid as the standard matter source with equation of state @xmath22 , the independent field equations for general @xmath0 gravity are as follows .",

    "we obtain : @xmath28",
    "in this paper we will study the dynamics of friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker ( flrw ) models only in the sector @xmath29 .",
    "this is because the sector @xmath30 is not of much physical interest and also , as we shall see later , the sectors @xmath31 and @xmath30 are connected by the invariant sub - manifold @xmath32 , making the physically interesting dynamics completely confined to the sector @xmath31 .",
    "also , we consider the 3-curvature to be vanishing , which is an invariant sub - manifold by itself . as required by the _ noghost condition _ we also assume @xmath33 .    to compactify the phase space we rewrite the friedmann equation ( [ f ] ) in the following form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 we can now define the following set of normalized variables : @xmath36 to guarantee that the propagation equations for these compact variables will result in a dimensionless dynamical system , we need to define a new time variable @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 for @xmath37 to be a monotonously increasing time variable ,",
    "a normalization d is chosen such that it is strictly positive at all times .",
    "it is clear by construction that when @xmath39 the normalized dynamical variables as well as the time variable are well defined , thus this normalization allows the study of general static , re - collapsing and bouncing solutions .    from the friedmann equation",
    "we obtain the following constraints , @xmath40 the first constraint comes directly from friedmann equation , while the second one arises from the definition of the normalization parameter d. according to these constraints and considering @xmath31 , @xmath41 and @xmath33 , we see that the above dynamical variables have to be defined in the following ranges , @xmath42 making the complete phase space compact . also since the variable @xmath43 is a normalized hubble parameter , the cosmological solutions will naturally include both expanding and collapsing as well as static solutions and these two sets of solutions are connected via the non - invariant subset @xmath44 .",
    "an autonomous system , which is equivalent to cosmological equations ( [ raychaudhuri]-[combination ] ) can be derived by differentiating the compact variables ( [ cv ] ) , with respect to @xmath37 and using ( [ raychaudhuri]-[conservation ] ) .",
    "the dimensionality of the resultant system can then be reduced by using the two constraints ( [ const ] ) . by eliminating the dynamical variables",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 , we obtain the following 3-dimensional effective autonomous system :    @xmath47 + x^2\\big[4 + 6\\omega+z(-3(1+\\omega)-2\\gamma ) \\big ] \\big ) \\nonumber\\\\ z'&=&\\dfrac{z}{3}\\big(-4q^2x - q((5 + 3\\omega)x^2 + 3(1+\\omega)(-1+z))\\nonumber\\\\ & + & x(5 + 3\\omega-(1 + 3\\omega)x^2-\\gamma\\big[-2 - 3n(1+\\omega)+2z+3n(1+\\omega)(z+(q+x)^2)\\big]\\big)\\\\ q'&=&\\dfrac{1}{6}\\big(-4q^2x - q\\big[(5 + 3\\omega)x^2 + 3(1+\\omega)(-1+z)\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & x(5 + 3\\omega-(1 + 3\\omega)x^2-\\gamma\\big[-2 - 3n(1+\\omega)+2z+3n(1+\\omega)((q+x)^2+z)\\big]\\big)\\;\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 . in general , the system is not closed unless @xmath49 is expressed in terms of the dynamical variables ( [ cv ] ) . for example , in the case of @xmath2",
    ", we have @xmath50}\\ , . \\label{gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the above system defines the dynamics of all well defined @xmath0 theories for which @xmath51 is invertible in terms of the dynamical variables . from equations ( [ ds ] ) we can see that @xmath52 is an invariant sub - manifold . and",
    "in the @xmath52 2-surface the line @xmath44 is an invariant subset .",
    "since @xmath52 corresponds to @xmath32 , we obtain an important result :    _ for all well defined functions @xmath0 , with @xmath33 and @xmath51 invertible in terms of the dynamical variables defined by ( [ cv ] ) , a flrw universes with nonnegative ricci scalar , continues to be so , both in the future and in the past .",
    "also an @xmath32 universe can never undergo a bounce in the future or the past .",
    "_    in the next section we will fix the function @xmath1 to be the class of theories @xmath53 and study the dynamics of the flat flrw universes and their stability for those theories . in order to study the stability of the fixed points of the dynamical systems ( [ ds ] ) , we will use the very well known techniques , which involve linearizing the dynamical equations around the equilibrium points and then finding the eigenvalues of the linearization matrix ( the jacobian ) at the equilibrium points .",
    "if the jacobian is well defined , then they can be classified according to the sign of the real part of eigenvalues as attractors , repellers and saddle points .",
    "as we have seen from the equation ( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath51 is invertible in terms of the dynamical variables for @xmath53 . it is interesting to note that the constant ` @xmath54 ' couples to the dynamical equations ( [ ds ] ) only via the quantity @xmath49 and the constant @xmath55 does not couple to the equations at all . hence all the fixed point of the system",
    "are necessarily independent of @xmath55 .",
    "the coordinates of the fixed points are shown in table 1 .",
    "note that each fixed point has an expanding ( @xmath56 ) and a collapsing ( @xmath57 ) version as indicated by the subscripts ( @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ) respectively .",
    "also some points only occur in the compact state space defined by ( [ range ] ) for certain ranges of @xmath54 .",
    "the occurrence of the fixed points outside the compact region for specific @xmath54 and @xmath60 means that the constraints ( [ const ] ) are not satisfied and consequently these fixed points are not physical for these values of @xmath54 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "fixed points that are not physical for these values of @xmath54 and @xmath60 have been excluded from the analysis .    * table 1*. coordinates of the equilibrium points for @xmath61-gravity .",
    "we will not explicitly state the expressions for s , g1, ... ,g4 and f1, ... ,f4 , which are rational functions of n and @xmath60 , however we give them at the following link @xcite .",
    "5.8pt    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the exact solutions at the fixed points are also summarized in table 1 and the stability analysis for the dust and radiation cases are summarized in table 2 .",
    "first we discuss the static solutions . from definition ( [ ds ] ) ,",
    "@xmath62 , so any fixed point that lies on the surface @xmath44 represents a static universe . by looking at the coordinates of the fixed points in table 1",
    ", we can see that the point @xmath63 is static for all values of n and @xmath60 .",
    "the point @xmath64 is static only for @xmath65 and @xmath66 and we find that for these values of @xmath54 the point @xmath64 represent an unstable saddle point .",
    "we now proceed to find the exact solutions for the scale factor at the nonstatic fixed points .",
    "the expansion rate and the deceleration parameter @xmath67 are related by the raychaudhuri equation , @xmath68 if we know the value of the deceleration parameter @xmath69 at some fixed point i , we can use the above equation to obtain the behavior of the scale factor at that point .",
    "when @xmath70 we have desitter solutions @xmath71 or static solutions @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    "we have a milne evolution and when @xmath74 ; @xmath75 we have accelerated and decelerated power law behaviours respectively .    to obtain the exact solutions for the scale factor @xmath76 associated with the nonstatic @xmath77 equilibrium points we need to have an expression for @xmath78 in term of the compact variables . from the definition @xmath78",
    "we obtain : @xmath79 the non - invariant surface @xmath80 is the transition surface between accelerated and decelerated expansions phases ( see fig 1 ) . by substituting [ q in term of compact v ] in [ deceleraion ] we obtain : @xmath81 where @xmath82 . the evolution of the scale factor can now be given directly by integrating equation [ scale factor ] : @xmath83 where @xmath84 the constants of integration can be obtained by substituting the solutions into the original equations .",
    "as explained in @xcite , these solutions must satisfy all the cosmological equations in order to be considered physical .    by looking at table 1",
    "we can distinguish two classes of nonstatic solutions .",
    "the first class @xmath85 and @xmath86 } contain solutions that are independent of n and @xmath60 .",
    "the fixed point b represents a static phase as mentioned earlier , the points a , d and f are radiationlike phases .",
    "the expanding version of the point a is a saddle for @xmath87 and repeller for @xmath52 and the other two points d an f are saddles .",
    "the fixed point n represent a matter phase and the expanding version of this point is a spiral@xmath88 .    the evolution of the scale factor a(t ) for the fixed point @xmath89 is a function of @xmath90 and for fixed point @xmath91 is function of @xmath92 . the dependence of these solutions on n and/or @xmath60 provide us with additional degrees of freedom that can lead to interesting cosmological scenarios .    when @xmath93 , the fixed point @xmath89 merges with @xmath94 for @xmath66 , and it merges with the point @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath97 it merges with @xmath95 for @xmath66 , and for @xmath98 it corresponds to the matter point @xmath94 . in the case @xmath93 or @xmath97 , we find that for all values n for which this point is physical , the expansion ( contraction ) is never accelerating .    as mentioned earlier , the evolution of the scale factor for the point @xmath91 is independent of the equation of state parameter @xmath60 . for @xmath99 the fixed point @xmath91",
    "merges with @xmath100 , for @xmath101 it merges with point @xmath102 and for @xmath103 it is a matter point .",
    "we also find that for this fixed point the expansion ( contraction ) is accelerating for @xmath104 .",
    "the existence of this accelerated phase together with the fact that for @xmath104 the point @xmath89 is a matter - like point , leads to the possibility of an extremely interesting cosmological scenario , where it is possible in principle to find an orbit that starts close to the unstable accelerating phase @xmath105 , evolves past the unstable radiationlike point @xmath106 , followed by the unstable matter point @xmath107 and finally ends up at the desitter attractor @xmath108 .    in figs . 3 and 4 we have plotted two interesting orbits .",
    "the orbit in fig 3 is for @xmath93 and @xmath99 .",
    "it begins near the radiationlike points @xmath109 , passes nearby the radiationlike point @xmath106 , followed by the standard matter point @xmath107 and ends up at the de - sitter attractor @xmath108 .",
    "the orbit in fig 4 is for @xmath110 and @xmath103 .",
    "it begins near the radiationlike point @xmath111 , passes nearby the matter point @xmath105 , then close to the matter point @xmath107 and ends up at the de sitter attractor @xmath108 .",
    "it is interesting to see that for all fixed points whose xcoordinate goes to zero as @xmath6 , are unstable . as the @xmath3cdm subspace lies on the @xmath112 surface and this surface",
    "is not an invariant submanifold , this implies that the behavior of the solutions of a fourth order theory which is close to @xmath3cdm , may be completely different from those of @xmath3cdm .",
    "furthermore , this suggests that the best fit model to the current observational data within the complete state space of @xmath2 , may be given by a non - infinitesimal value of @xmath54 .     for @xmath113 ; @xmath114 .",
    "the left half of the state space corresponds to collapsing models , while the right half contain expanding models .",
    "this is indicated by the subscripts of the various equilibrium points.,width=302 ]     and @xmath99.,width=340 ]     and @xmath103.,width=340 ]",
    "in this work , we have presented a careful analysis of the state space of the class of @xmath2 theorys of gravity , focusing on the @xmath31 sector with @xmath115 , together with the no - ghost condition @xmath116 .",
    "due to the complexity of this class of gravity theories , the standard hubble normalization does not lead to a compact dynamical variables . in order to construct variables defining a compact dynamical system",
    "one has to use an appropriate normalization . in this paper",
    "we used the same formalism used in @xcite , where we absorbed all the negative contributions of the friedmann equation into the normalization .",
    "first of all we obtained the following important result : for all well defined function @xmath0 , with @xmath33 and @xmath51 invertible in terms of the dynamical variables defined by @xmath117 , the flrw universes with non - negative ricci scalar , continues to be so both in the future and in the past .",
    "also an r = 0 universe can never undergo a bounce in the future or past .",
    "our compact analysis shows that there are more equilibrium points than in the corresponding non - compact analysis in @xcite .",
    "in particular we find a new finite fixed point @xmath86 .",
    "because of it s very special location in the phase space , it is quite difficult to obtain this point using the standard techniques .",
    "this point is found to represent a matter phase and the expanding version of this point is @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , we find that for @xmath119 the phase space of @xmath2 , contains two accelerated fixed points @xmath120 , together with two other saddle points ( one represent a radiation phase @xmath106 and the other represent a matter - like phase @xmath107 ) .",
    "although we have obtained all the desired fixed points and desired stability , this does not necessarily imply that there is an orbit connecting them . due to the fact that for @xmath119 , the two accelerated points and the matter - like point are quite close to each other in the phase space , which makes it difficult to prove the existence of an orbit connecting these points together with the radiationlike point .",
    "but the presence of all these phases in the state space of @xmath2 makes a more detailed investigation worth pursuing .",
