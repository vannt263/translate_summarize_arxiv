    "these bound states feature peculiar low - temperature contributions to the magnetic penetration length@xcite(see also@xcite ) and the zero - bias conductance peak@xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "a minimum in the penetration depth of @xmath5 films@xcite and grain boundary junctions@xcite was thus interpreted as evidence for low - energy andreev bound states . a conventional shielding - current contribution to the meissner effect",
    "would obviously just monotonically reduce the penetration depth when the temperature goes down .",
    "on the other hand , a paramagnetic contribution from low - energy bound states increases the penetration depth .",
    "the interplay of these two effects amounts to a minimum in the penetration depth as a function of the temperature .",
    "the characteristic temperature @xmath3 of this anomaly is shown to be the order @xmath6 if the broadening @xmath7 of the bound states is sufficiently small .",
    "at this temperature region the bound state contribution to the penetration depth competes with the low - temperature correction from shielding supercurrents to its zero - temperature value .",
    "an alternative explanation of an upturn in the penetration depth is possible in compounds whose bulk paramagnetic properties grow when the temperature goes down , like in the electron - doped cuprate superconductor @xmath8 . there",
    "the paramagnetism arises from @xmath9 ions@xcite .",
    "we will not discuss these compounds below .",
    "there is yet another important temperature associated with the magnetic penetration depth , @xmath10 .",
    "if a given crystal orientation does not carry quasiparticle andreev bound states , a nonlocal effect can take over as a correction to the zero temperature penetration depth in the clean limit@xcite . then in other orientations which do admit andreev states , the bound - state contribution and the spontaneous surface supercurrent in particular",
    ", can in turn overwhelm the nonlocal effect . at @xmath11",
    "the bound state paramagnetic contribution to @xmath12 in the clean limit@xcite is the order of the total london penetration depth @xmath13 from the screening currents . in the absence of sub - dominant pairing channels",
    ", a spontaneous surface supercurrent brought about by the bound states may arise below the temperature @xmath14@xcite ( see also@xcite on a similar effect of spontaneous magnetization brought about by low energy interface bound states ) .",

    "nonmagnetic impurities in superconductors with an anisotropic order parameter are known to be pair breaking .",
    "they suppress @xmath20 analogously to what happens to isotropic superconductors with magnetic impurities .",
    "assuming superconductors always clean within the conventional definition @xmath21 , we disregard this kind of effects throughout the article .",
    "even then impurity broadening of andreev bound states in anisotropically paired superconductors can be significant .",
    "since the broadening removes singularities in the density of states ( for instance , @xmath22-peaks from quasiparticle bound states ) as well as in other related physical quantities , superconductors can be sensitive to extremely small concentrations of impurities@xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the role of pair breaking and small anisotropy of the gap in the riedel anomaly in isotropic @xmath4-wave superconductors .",
    "the riedel anomaly is associated with the bcs singularity in the density of states .",
    "pair breaking and small anisotropy of the gap are known to wipe out the bcs singularity in the density of states averaged over the fermi surface , and control the height of the riedel peak@xcite .",
    "the emphasis of the present work is on the various effects of broadening on the low temperature anomalies of the meissner effect .",
    "the zero - energy pole - like term of what is known as the quasiclassical green s function was exploited in the investigation .",
    "broadening is introduced into the pole - like term simply sliding the pole along the imaginary energy axis . with small broadening , relatively simple expressions are found for the penetration length in the two lowest - temperature regions defined above .",
    "if @xmath23 , the growing @xmath7 can wipe out the low - temperature anomalies . beginning with the critical broadening @xmath24 , anomalies at @xmath25 are fully destroyed .",
    "it turns out that unitary scatterers need to come with significantly larger scattering rates @xmath26 than born impurities in order to achieve the critical broadening @xmath24 .",
    "this effect is peculiar of the impact of impurities on the andreev bound states as seen in the local density of states and josephson critical currents@xcite .",
    "for this reason , the requirements the mean free path must meet for the low temperature anomalies to show up are sensitive to the strength of the impurity potential and very different in the unitary and the born limits .    for born scatterers , the shortest normal - state impurity mean free path @xmath27 which preserves the low temperature upturn at @xmath28",
    "is shown to be @xmath29 .",
    "this looks quite restrictive although conceivably compatible with the strikingly large low temperature mean free paths in some high-@xmath20 compounds@xcite . for the spontaneous surface supercurrent in the absence of a subdominant component at the surface",

    "this demands extraordinary clean samples not available for the time being . on the other hand , the requirements set by unitary scatterers are much weaker and probably can be met . in this case surface roughness",
    "is likely to control the broadening and the experimental observability of the effects .",
    "we also examine what the andreev bound states do to the nonlinear meissner effect . at low temperatures @xmath31 , the field @xmath32",
    "at which the nonlinear response of the bound states saturates in the clean limit@xcite is much weaker than the one from the screening current . ignoring the broadening , @xmath32 is a linear function of the temperature . with @xmath33 ,",

    "hence , a study of the penetration depth at low temperatures @xmath61 may be carried out disregarding nonlocal effects .",
    "then a magnetic field enters into eq.([gcur ] ) only together with the matsubara frequencies @xmath62 in the argument of the green s function .",
    "the kernel @xmath63 can then be written @xmath64    in the presence of zero - energy surface bound states , the pole - like term in the propagator becomes dominating at temperatures @xmath31 .",
    "surface bound states as well as their paramagnetic response are localized on the scale of the coherence length at the surface , however , while the conventional screening current has an avenue of the huge thickness of the penetration depth .",

    "node contributions do not dominate , however , in the following expressions .",
    "the presence of zero - energy surface bound states is crucial in the reasoning .",
    "all sectors of the fermi surface associated with a sign change of the order parameter in a quasiparticle reflection from the surface , contribute significantly to the results .",
    "this allows us to neglect , to a good accuracy , the factor @xmath83 under the integral sign in eq.([lambda902 ] ) .",

    "analogously , for a simple model of a quasi - two - dimensional superconductor with a cylindrical fermi surface , @xmath94 and the coefficient @xmath95 .    in particular , for a @xmath76-wave superconductor with a cylindrical fermi surface",
    ", we get from eq.([lambda8 ] ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the angle between the surface normal and the direction to a node of the order parameter , while @xmath98 is the angle between the surface normal and the crystalline @xmath75-axis along its positive lobe .",
    "we note that the correction from zero energy bound states to the penetration depth ( the third term in eq.([lambda8 ] ) ) has a quite universal form .",
    "it is independent both of the spatial profile of the order parameter near a surface and its particular anisotropic structure ( basis functions ) .",
    "therefore , this correction depends only on the type of pairing , which determines regions on the fermi surface with opposite signs of the order parameter .",

    "vanishes for @xmath108 ( i.e. for @xmath109 ) , when there are no zero energy bound states .",
    "broadening of the bound states can substantially modify the conditions for the presence of a minimum in the low temperature dependence of the penetration depth . for a small broadening @xmath110 we simply replace the factor @xmath111 in the expression eq.([gs1 ] ) for the pole - like term with @xmath112}$ ] .",

    "as an example , the low - temperature correction to the penetration depth is shown in fig .  1 in the vicinity of @xmath121 for various values of the momentum independent broadening",

    "with born scatterers @xmath122 ( see ref .  ) and",
    "the coefficient of the order of unity can be estimated within the simple model of spatially constant order parameter",
    ". then we easily get the shortest normal - state impurity mean free path @xmath27 which admits a low - temperature upturn : @xmath29 . in high - temperature superconductors one should distinguish between @xmath27 and the actual mean free path in the normal state at @xmath20 incorporating significant contributions from inelastic processes .",
    "impurity scattering dominates there at low temperatures already in the superconducting state where the collapse of inelastic scattering takes place . for instance , below 20 k in @xmath5 there is a regime of extremely long and weakly temperature dependent quasiparticle scattering times@xcite usually interpreted as due to feeble impurity scattering in high - purity samples .    for scatterers with sufficient strength of impurity potential there are practically no restrictions on the impurity scattering rate in contrast to what was found above for born impurities . for unitary scatterers with scattering rates @xmath123",

    "correspondingly , @xmath3 given in eq.([min ] ) is valid for unitary scatterers only if @xmath132 , which sets an upper limit on the scattering rate : @xmath133 .",

    "it does not melt away at any @xmath123 .",
    "the normal - state impurity mean free path must just be large on the scale of the coherence length .",
    "we conclude that observation of the low temperature upturn of the penetration depth in samples with @xmath138 is evidence for both andreev bound states and a sufficiently large strength of the bulk impurity potential in the superconducting compounds . for unitary impurities one needs to take into account the broadening that arises from surface roughness which then very probably controls the total broadening .",

    "below the upturn temperature @xmath3 , imagine a great deal of space for @xmath12 to grow , firstly as described by the perturbative result eq.([lambda8 ] ) .",
    "then a second order phase transition occurs at @xmath139 into a state which carries a spontaneous surface supercurrent@xcite .",
    "we shall find an analytic expression for the transition temperature and discuss the impact of impurities on the effect .",
    "the transition implies the absence of subdominant channels activated at low temperatures close to the surface on account of the presumably large surface pair breaking in the dominant component of the order parameter .",
    "otherwise a spontaneous current can arise at higher temperatures@xcite .",
    "there is experimental evidence @xcite for a phase transition on the ( 110 ) surface in @xmath5 at @xmath140 .",
    "it was interpreted as associated with an activated near surface subdominant channel of the order parameter@xcite . for some other crystal - to - surface orientations ,",
    "however , a subdominant component can be not present near a surface@xcite .",
    "zero energy bound states can still arise for a noticeable part of quasiparticle trajectories .",
    "our theoretical study is relevant to these cases .    in order to find an equation for the transition temperature",
    ", one has to admit a paramagnetic contribution to the penetration depth at least as large as the diamagnetic one .",
    "then a perturbation treatment of the preceding section is not adequate . in this context",
    "we develop an approach based on the integral form of eq.([max ] ) and take into account only the terms in @xmath69 brought about by the bound states . in other words , a contribution only from the pole - like term eq.([gs1 ] ) needs to be taken into account in eqs.([kernel ] ) for the kernel which enters into eq.([max ] ) .",
    "the kernel @xmath69 varies on the characteristic scale @xmath82 and is associated in the clean limit@xcite with large contributions to the magnetic field at the surface at temperatures @xmath141 .",
    "we therefore disregard the nonlocal temperature correction from the meissner current to @xmath69 .",

    "at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath203 , i.e. well below the transition to the state with a spontaneous surface supercurrent , a paramagnetic response from the bound states may become seriously nonlinear already in the meissner state @xmath204@xcite .",
    "we will show , however , that the broadening of the bound states introduces a new field scale @xmath205 coming into play at @xmath206 .",
    "for @xmath207 nonlinear corrections from andreev low - energy bound states to the penetration length turn out always to be small in the meissner state , even at @xmath208 .    as a pole - like term eq.([gs1 ] ) decays exponentially on the scale @xmath209 for almost all momentum directions admitting bound states , we consider a local nonlinear current - field relation @xmath210 for the current via the bound states .",
    "one can also set the vector potential @xmath154 in the kernel equal to @xmath211 .",
    "then we easily generalize the reasoning in the derivation of the third term in eq.([lambda1 ] ) . substituting into eq.([gacur ] ) the expression eq.([gs1 ] ) for the pole - like term with the pole shifted in accordance with the broadening , we find : @xmath212 in eq.([nl ] ) the fermi surface is assumed symmetric in reflections across the @xmath213-plane .",
    "then averages over the fermi surface of odd powers of @xmath214 vanish , no matter whether they are multiplied by @xmath215 or not . this applies , in particular , to a @xmath1-wave superconductor with a cylindrical fermi surface whose principal axis @xmath56 is parallel to the boundary for arbitrary orientations of the two other crystal axes @xmath216 , @xmath217 .",
    "if @xmath218 , one can expand the @xmath219-function in eq.([nl ] ) in powers of the small parameter @xmath220 .",
    "considering nonlinear corrections to the penetration depth from screening currents @xmath221 and bound states @xmath222 to be small , one can represent them in the first approximation as additive contributions to the total penetration depth @xmath223 .",
    "the nonlinear correction from screening currents takes the form @xmath224 $ ] .",
    "quantities @xmath0 and @xmath225 being the zero - field values of @xmath183 , @xmath193 respectively , satisfy eq.([sing ] ) . bound states renormalize nonlinear response from screening currents already in this approximation .",
    "thus , the explicit analysis of @xmath221 can be done combining the results of the preceding section and refs .. apart from too close to the transition temperature @xmath19 , the nonlinear correction to the penetration depth from the bound states is : @xmath226    in the limit @xmath227 when the argument of the @xmath219-function in eq.([nl ] ) is large , we obtain @xmath228 then the broadening rather than the temperature fixes the bound state contribution to the penetration depth .",
    "as shown above , there is no state with a spontaneous surface current with @xmath229 . then @xmath230 and @xmath231 . since @xmath232 in the meissner state we estimate @xmath233 and obtain in this limit from eq.([nl2 ] ) @xmath234 @xmath235    for a given @xmath193 , eq.([sing2 ] ) in general should be solved with respect to @xmath183 in accordance with eq.([nl ] ) , since @xmath236 .",
    "this is particularly important close to the transition temperature @xmath19 , where the landau theory of second order phase transitions is applicable .",
    "then first nonlinear term turns out to be the order of the zero - field paramagnetic contribution in the denominator in eq.([sing2 ] ) . ignoring a weak field dependence of @xmath193 stipulated by screening currents",
    ", we obtain from eqs.([sing2 ] ) , ( [ nl ] ) the following equation for @xmath183 : @xmath237 where @xmath238 , @xmath239 @xmath19 is described by eq.([tsgamma ] ) and @xmath240 is the result of the substitution @xmath241 on the right hand side of eq.([tsgamma ] ) .",
    "the broadening is assumed to be sufficiently small for admitting the phase transition .",
    "the role of the order parameter in the phase transition can be played by a surface magnetization @xmath242 , which , for simplicity , we choose constant in space along a smooth surface .",
    "the magnetization @xmath243 enters by the conventional definition @xmath244 , and @xmath245 .",
    "then the landau free energy per unit surface @xmath246 which leads to the same equation for @xmath247 as implied in eq.([eql ] ) has the form @xmath248 where @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 is the external field . as for a conventional order parameter in a strong field near @xmath19",
    "one gets @xmath252 , which entails @xmath253 .",
    "finally , in the limit of very small broadening @xmath254 , eqs.([sing2 ] ) and ( [ nl2 ] ) give @xmath255 at temperatures @xmath256 .",
    "since @xmath257 is at least the order of @xmath13 , we put here @xmath258 disregarding small nonlinear corrections from the screening currents in the meissner state .",
    "the approximate inverse proportionality of the penetration length the magnetic field implies the presence of a spontaneous surface magnetization weakly dependent on @xmath251 .",
    "we have examined the paramagnetic contribution from surface zero - energy andreev bound states to the low - temperature penetration length of @xmath1-wave superconductors in the meissner state .",
    "the paramagnetic current is localized within several coherence lengths near the surface and grows larger in the clean limit when the temperature goes down .",
    "a broadening of the bound states chokes their contribution and determines their actual role in shaping the penetration length .",
    "we found that the upturn in the low temperature penetration depth lies at @xmath2 in the clean limit where the paramagnetic contribution from the bound states can be handled with perturbation theory same as small low - temperature corrections to the penetration depth from the screening current .",
    "the minimum broadening capable of straightening out the upturn is @xmath259 .",
    "furthermore , we examined the penetration depth when the bound states must be kept track of beyond perturbation theory .",
    "a divergence of @xmath0 was found at the phase transition to a state with spontaneous surface supercurrent .",
    "this transition occurs only with smallish broadening , @xmath260 . in the clean limit@xcite and at low temperatures",
    ", there is a nonlinear regime of the paramagnetic current already in magnetic fields substantially weaker than the fields for the nonlinear effects to show up in response of shielding supercurrents .",
    "the broadening of the bound states modifies and weakens the nonlinear response .",
    "specifying an origin of the broadening as associated with nonmagnetic impurity scattering , we obtained restrictions on the mean free path admitting the low temperature anomalies .",
    "the conditions turn out to be sensitive to the strength of the impurity potential and very different in the unitary and in the born limits .",
    "the born impurities are shown to easily prevent the anomalies of the penetration depth taking place at least well below @xmath3 .",
    "by contrast , unitary scatterers with sufficiently small normal - state scattering rate @xmath123 admit the transition to a state with spontaneous surface supercurrent at @xmath261 . in the latter case",
    ", however , surface roughness very probably dominates the broadening and controls the bound state contribution to the low - temperature penetration length .",
