    "the motivation to measure the half - life of @xmath0 stems from its natural production solely in stellar environments and from the implications of its discovery throughout the galaxy .",
    "neutron - rich @xmath0 is produced in stellar environments of high neutron densities .",
    "environments capable of having such neutron densities are in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and massive stars , through the neutron - producing reactions of @xmath12(@xmath13 , n)@xmath14 and @xmath15(@xmath13 , n)@xmath16 respectively . the material produced in these environments can then be released to the surrounding interstellar medium through supernova explosions and hypothesized processes such as stellar winds .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 can be expelled and observed in the galaxy specifically in three distinct ways .    _",
    "@xmath4-ray observations _ :",
    "the decay of @xmath0 , specifically two @xmath4-rays from the decay of its daughter product , @xmath8 , at energies of 1173 kev and 1332 kev ( see figure [ fig : mydecay1 ] for the full decay scheme of @xmath0 ) , has been observed by 19 bgo - shielded hpge detectors on the spacecraft integral when looking toward the center of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests that nucleosynthesis is an ongoing process , as @xmath0 s half - life is significantly shorter than the age of the galaxy .",
    "@xmath17__ni _ _ _ in meteorites _ : lower @xmath5/@xmath18 isotopic ratios , @xmath5 being the granddaughter of @xmath0 , have been found in meteorites as compared to samples from earth and mars @xcite .",
    "these meteorites would have been formed during the early solar system ( ess ) .",
    "the higher isotopic ratios in younger samples supports the hypothesis that @xmath0 was injected into the solar system after its formation .",
    "precise timing and abundances of @xmath0 in our solar system would put constraints on ess models and the environment in which it formed .",
    "@xmath17__fe _ _ _ excesses in ocean crust , lunar , and microfossil samples _ : studies on ocean crust samples have found an excess of @xmath0 above background levels , dating to approximately 1.5 - 3.2 million years ago ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) as well as 6.5 - 8.7 million years ago @xcite .",
    "similar signatures have been found in lunar samples @xcite and in microfossil records @xcite .",
    "these excesses would seem to indicate that the solar system passed through the debris field of multiple supernova events in the last 10 million years , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the first half - life value , published in 1957 by roy and kohman @xcite , was @xmath19 years with a factor of 3 uncertainty .",
    "after this publication , it was determined that certain assumptions made in it , specifically the relative production rates of @xmath0 versus @xmath20 , may have been incorrect .",
    "therefore a longer half - life value could not be ruled out .",
    "kutschera et al .",
    "measured the half - life in 1984 , finding @xmath21 years by a combination of an activity and an accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) measurements @xcite .",
    "however , the complex ams experiment may have resulted in a somewhat lower @xmath0 isotopic ratio in the sample material than was actually present . in a third measurement by rugel et al . in 2009 ,",
    "the @xmath0 isotopic ratio was determined from new sample material with a higher @xmath0 isotopic ratio by multicollector - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( mc - icpms ) .",
    "this measurement published a significantly longer half - life of @xmath22 years @xcite and was confirmed in 2015 by wallner et al . , which published a value of @xmath23 years @xcite .",
    "the last 3 half - life measurements have all used the decay of the ground state of @xmath6 to quantify the activity of an @xmath0 sample , coupled with a measurement of the number of @xmath0 atoms .",
    "this work , in contrast , focuses on the use of the direct decay of the isomeric state of @xmath6 , as did the roy and kohman measurement @xcite .",
    "the sample used for this work is described in the following section . in sections [ activity ] and [ ams ] ,",
    "the experimental procedures are discussed , including the decay scheme of @xmath0 , the direct decay activity measurement , and a determination of the number of @xmath0 atoms in the sample using accelerator mass spectrometry .",
    "uncertainties in this work were estimated according to the recommendations in the guide to expression of uncertainty in measurements @xcite .",
    "all given uncertainties are combined standard uncertainties with a coverage factor of k=1 .",
    "@xmath0 is only naturally produced in slow neutron capture process sites such as stellar environments .",
    "the samples used for this work , produced artificially , come from spallation reactions resulting from high energy ( 590 mev ) protons incident on a copper beam stop at the paul scherrer institute .",
    "the beam stop was in use for 12 years , building up numerous radioactive isotopes including @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "material was extracted from the beam stop and iron was chemically separated .",
    "the material of this present work was originally used as a target in a cross section measurement of @xmath0(n,@xmath4)@xmath24 at stellar energies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 from the target was later recovered and @xmath6 was chemically removed .",
    "some of this recovered material was sent to the vienna environmental research accelerator ( vera ) laboratory in austria to be used to create a dilution series . in this series ,",
    "a total of four samples were created , each with an @xmath0/@xmath10 isotopic ratio subsequently lower by one order of magnitude .",
    "further details of each sample can be found in wallner et al .",
    "@xcite . by knowing",
    "the amount of stable iron added to the sample and using the technique of ams on a small subset of the sample to determine its isotopic ratio , the total number of @xmath0 atoms in the sample can be calculated .",
    "portions of each of the four resulting samples from the dilution series were combusted into iron oxide powder , with the rest remaining as a liquid .",
    "the university of notre dame measurement concentrated on two of the samples , fe-1 and fe-4 , and their expected isotopic ratios can be found in table [ samples ] .",
    "for this work we received powdered versions of each sample .",
    "the powdered material of fe-4 , used for an ams measurement , was concurrently measured by wallner et al .",
    "we also recieved the remaining liquid part of the most concentrated sample , fe-1 .",
    "the liquid solution of fe-1 , with an identical @xmath0/@xmath10 isotopic ratio as the powdered fe-1 material , was evaporated into a point source for the activity measurement . performing the ams and activity measurements on the same material in principle",
    "bypasses the need to rely on the dilution factor , shown in table [ samples ] .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : mydecay1 ] , @xmath0 decays to the 2 + isomeric state in @xmath6 .",
    "this state then primarily decays to the ground state in @xmath6 , ( 99.75 @xmath25 0.03)% of the total , with a half - life of 10.467 minutes .",
    "the decay is either via internal conversion , ( @xmath26)% , or the emission of a @xmath27 kev @xmath4-ray , ( intensity , i@xmath28% = @xmath29)% . from here",
    ", the ground state of @xmath6 decays to an excited state in @xmath5 with a half - life of ( 1925.28 @xmath25 0.14 ) days .",
    "these excited states decay quickly to the stable ground state of @xmath5 .",
    "the predominant lines here are the cascades of @xmath30 kev and @xmath31 kev .",
    "further details of the decay scheme of @xmath0 can be found in @xcite .",
    "these last two @xmath4-ray lines , as a proxy for the decay of @xmath0 , are referred to as the grow - in decay because of the necessary wait time for the decay of @xmath6 s ground state . measuring the grow - in decay requires and assumes a reduction of any possible @xmath6 present in the @xmath0 material by chemical separation to negligible levels prior to starting the activity experiment .",
    "all previous measurements of the half - life , not including the initial one in 1957 , have used the grow - in decay .",
    "conversely , this work measured the isomeric decay of @xmath6 s 2 + excited state , specifically the 58.6 kev @xmath4-ray line , which eliminates the need for the wait time and complex chemistry techniques as it is directly fed by the beta decay of @xmath0 .    as discussed above in section [ sample ] , the sample used for both the activity and the ams ( see below , section [ ams ] ) measurements was the fe-1 sample . specifically for the activity measurement , the remaining 13.0016 ml of fe-1 was used .",
    "this sample was reduced to a point source at the physics division of argonne national laboratory by evaporating most of the hcl acid solution in the sample .",
    "once the sample size was less than 0.1 ml , it was transferred by a loss - less pipet to a piece of mylar ( 1.25 inches by 1.25 inches , 0.002 inches thick ) and allowed to dry fully forming a deposition spot of 0.242 inches in diameter .",
    "all vessels , vials , pipets , etc . were measured for activity after the evaporation .",
    "there was negligible activity left on any of the materials and all vials , which were weighed before and after the evaporation , had no changes outside of the uncertainty of the scale used .",
    "the total @xmath0 activity in the sample is relatively small and was expected to be about 1.3 bq from the data given in @xcite .",
    "therefore , a close - up counting geometry using two planar , high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors in a head - to - head arrangement was used .",
    "planar hpge detectors exhibit high efficiencies ( on the order of 10% for full energy peak efficiencies ) at low energies ( 3 to 300 kev ) due to the use of a thin beryllium window mounted on the end cap .",
    "both detectors were ortec model glp 50xxx/15-s , with the following characteristics : active crystal diameter : 51.0 mm , active crystal depth : 14.3 mm , be window thickness : 0.5 mm , crystal position from inside of be window : 11 mm ( detector 1 ) , 12 mm ( detector 2 ) .",
    "the detectors were placed in a head - to - head geometry and were completely surrounded by two layers of lead bricks ( for a total 10 cm wall thickness ) , specifically selected for their low intrinsic background activity .",
    "this was done to suppress the environmental background .",
    "a photograph of the lead castle configuration is shown in figure [ fig : castle ] .",
    "the advantage of this setup is the enhanced registered count rate of the @xmath6 @xmath4-rays .",
    "0.25 ) mm from the target ( or ( 17.5 @xmath25 0.25 ) mm for the last measurement ) with a plastic target holder centered between them , which would hold samples and calibration sources at the same location . ]    for the efficiency calibration , a 1 ml aliquote of a certified @xmath32 solution from eckert and ziegler , ( 3763 @xmath25 113 ) bq , was used .",
    "this particular isotope was chosen because of a predominant @xmath4-ray line at 59.54 kev ( intensity of ( 35.9 @xmath25 0.07)% ) which is within the full - width at half - maximum of the detectors to the emission line of @xmath33    to cancel out additional corrections due to differences in the fe-1 sample s geometry , attenuations factors of the backing material , and the chemical composition , the @xmath32 reference source needs to be of a similar geometry and composition .",
    "as the fe-1 sample has 6.5 mg of stable iron in it ( 13% of the 50 mg added to the total fe-1 sample ) , the same amount was added to the @xmath32 prior to evaporation ( see table [ tab : amounts ] ) .",
    "the @xmath32 source then went through the same evaporation process as the fe-1 activity sample so that both would have very similar properties .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      knowing the isotopic ratio of @xmath0/@xmath10 and the amount of @xmath10 added to the sample , the total number of @xmath0 atoms can be calculated .",
    "relying on the dilution factors , wallner et al .",
    "published a value of @xmath34 @xmath0 atoms in the full fe-1 sample .",
    "in contrast , this work s direct measurement of the isotopic ratio of fe-1 yields @xmath35 @xmath0 atoms in the full fe-1 material , relying on fe-4 as an ams reference . combining both of these numbers with this work s direct activity measurement from section [ activity ] gives a half - life value of @xmath9 years ( for the wallner isotopic ratio ) and @xmath36 years ( for this work s isotopic ratio ) .",
    "both results confirm the longer half - life value of wallner et al . @xcite .",
    "the first one indicates that the @xmath0 activity measurement through the @xmath33 decay ( this work ) agrees with the one through the @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "although the second result also agrees with the longer half - life , it has a larger uncertainty due to the ams measurement of this work .",
    "this work is the first to pair a direct decay measurement of @xmath33 with a corresponding ams measurement .",
    "it is also the first to perform both on the same sample material , removing any reliance on a dilution or differing chemistry procedures . with the development of an @xmath0 beam and a low - level - background counting station at the university of notre dame",
    ", we combined the results of the two experiments , finding a half - life of @xmath37 years .",
    "this is in agreement , albeit with a large uncertainty , with the most recent experiments ( rugel et al .",
    "@xcite and wallner et al .",
    "@xcite ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : overlap ] . combining this work s activity measurement with the ams measurements performed instead by wallner et al .",
    "gives a half - life value of @xmath38 years , also confirming a substantially longer half - life value than previously accepted .",
