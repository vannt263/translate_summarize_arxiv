    "more than 40 years have passed since the recognition that quasars are at cosmological distances ( schmidt 1963 ; greenstein & mathews 1963 ; mathews & sandage 1963 ) and hence must be powerful energy sources .",
    "a combination of arguments based on time variability and energetics strongly supports the view that the activity is produced by the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies ( e.g. salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich & novikov 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ) .",
    "however , the mechanism that provides the trigger to fuel quasars remains uncertain .",
    "recent discoveries of correlations between masses of black holes in nearby galaxies and either the mass ( magorrian et al . 1998 ) or velocity dispersion ( i.e. the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation : ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) of spheroids demonstrate a fundamental link between the growth of supermassive black holes and galaxy formation .",
    "however , theoretical evidence connecting the origin of supermassive black holes and quasars to galaxy evolution remains elusive , owing to the complexity of the underlying physics and dynamics .",
    "in particular , up to now there has been no comprehensive model to explain the origin and fueling of quasars , or their lifetimes , obscuration , demographics , self - regulation and termination , and dependence on host galaxy properties .",
    "observations of the nearby universe suggest that rapid black hole growth may be related to massive flows of gas into the centers of galaxies .",
    "infrared ( ir ) luminous galaxies represent the dominant population of objects above @xmath6 locally and it is believed that much of their ir emission is powered by dust reprocessing of radiation from intense nuclear starbursts ( e.g. soifer et al .",

    "1986 ; sargent et al .",
    "1987 , 1989 ) . some ulirgs exhibit `` warm '' ir spectral energy distributions , perhaps indicative of a buried quasar ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "this fact , together with the overlap between bolometric luminosities of ulirgs and quasars , led sanders et al .",
    "( 1988a ) to propose that quasars are the descendents of an infrared luminous phase of galaxy evolution caused by mergers .",
    "this scenario is supported by recent x - ray observations which have revealed the presence of two non - thermal point sources near the center of the ulirg ngc6240 @xcite , which are most naturally interpreted as accreting supermassive black holes that are heavily obscured at visual wavelengths ( e.g. gerssen et al .",

    "it is not immediately obvious how quasar lifetimes @xmath11yr can be explained in the context of gas inflows triggered by galaxy mergers .",

    "semi - analytical models of supermassive black hole evolution and its correlation with galaxy structure suggest that , beyond a certain threshold , feedback energy expels nearby gas and shuts down the accretion phase @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations provide only limits , and in neglecting the dynamics of quasar evolution they do not predict time - dependent effects such as the characteristic lifetime of the accretion phase prior to its self - termination , the fueling rates for black hole accretion , the obscuration of central sources , or the quasar light curve .",
    "these quantities are instead usually taken to be independent input parameters of the model .",
    "for example , the lifetime is either adopted from observational estimates or assumed to be similar to a characteristic timescale such as the dynamical time of the host galaxy disk or the @xmath15-folding time for eddington - limited black hole growth @xmath16yr for accretion with radiative efficiency @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "although generally restricted to one - dimensional `` toy models '' which do not include galaxy - galaxy interactions , such modeling has made important progress in predicting the characteristic duty cycles of quasars , in good agreement with e.g. , @xcite , and in demonstrating the importance of radiative feedback on the surrounding medium and quasar evolution ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "further , @xcite showed that self regulation by radiative feedback from quasars in this modeling can expel a significant quantity of gas and leave a remnant with properties similar to observed ellipticals and black hole mass corresponding to the observed @xmath19-@xmath5 relation .",
    "similarly @xcite showed that incorporating a simple prescription for radiative heating by quasars in the context of cosmological simulations yields populations of elliptical galaxies consistent with observed optical and x - ray properties .",
    "recently , @xcite have developed a methodology for incorporating black hole growth and feedback into hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers that includes a multiphase model for star formation and pressurization of the interstellar gas by supernova feedback @xcite . using this approach ,",

    "( 2005b ) have shown that the gas inflows produced by gravitational torques during a merger both trigger starbursts ( as in the earlier simulations of e.g. mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ) and fuel rapid black hole growth .",
    "the growth of the black hole is determined by the gas supply and terminates abruptly when significant gas is expelled owing to the coupling between feedback energy from black hole accretion and the surrounding gas .",
    "eventually , as the gas is heated and driven out , the remnant is no longer active because the black hole does not accrete at a high rate , leaving a dead quasar in an ordinary galaxy .",
    "the self - regulated nature of the black hole growth explains observed correlations between black hole mass and properties of normal galaxies @xcite , as well as the color distribution of ellipticals @xcite .",
    "these results lend support to the view that mergers have played an important role in structuring galaxies , as advocated by e.g. toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) and toomre ( 1977 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that the dynamics of the inflowing gas and its response to the self - regulated growth of the black hole yield a timescale for the strong accretion phase @xmath12 yr , comparable to the full duration of the starburst . during much of this period",
    ", the bolometric luminosity of the black hole would exceed the threshold to be classified as a quasar , implying a timescale @xmath20 ( for a milky way mass system ) for the intrinsic quasar phase of the black hole .    in @xcite ,",
    "we employed models for obscuration by gas and dust to show that for most of the accretion lifetime the quasars would be buried ; i.e. heavily obscured by the large gas density powering accretion . eventually , feedback from the accretion energy drives away the gas , creating a brief window in which the central object would be observable as an optical quasar , until accretion levels drop below quasar thresholds . by calculating the effects of obscuration from the simulation of a merger of gas - rich galaxies",
    ", we showed that this determines an observable lifetime @xmath21 , in good agreement with observations .    here ,",
    "we extend and further develop implications of the model for quasar evolution proposed in @xcite  by analyzing a series of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers where we vary the masses of the progenitor galaxies , so that they have virial velocities between 80 and @xmath22 . in  2  we describe our series of merger simulations and the calculation of column densities and obscuration , and compare the results obtained with different column density calculations . in  3  we examine the frequency dependence of our results and quantify the differences in lifetimes across the optical and x - ray bands . in  4  we examine the typical column densities along lines - of - sight to the simulated quasars , and compare these to observed distributions from both optical and x - ray surveys . in  5  we show the simulation results for our merger series and compare the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a function of luminosity for all the simulations .",
    "finally , in  6  we discuss our results and the implications of our model for a broad range of quasar studies .",
    "the simulations were performed using the gadget-2 code , a new version of the parallel treesph code gadget @xcite .",
    "it uses an entropy - conserving formulation @xcite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , and includes radiative cooling , heating by a uv background ( as described in e.g. katz et al . 1996 ;",
    "dav et al . 1999 ) , and a sub - resolution model of a multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ) to describe star formation and supernova feedback @xcite .",
    "this sub - resolution model provides an effective equation of state for star - forming gas which includes pressure feedback from supernova heating , and allows us to stably evolve even massive pure gas disks ( see , e.g. springel et al .",

    "we begin our simulation with pure gas disks , which may better correspond to the high - redshift galaxies in which most quasars are observed .    each galaxy",
    "is initially composed of 168000 dark matter halo particles , 8000 bulge particles , 24000 gaseous disk particles , and one bh particle , with a small initial seed mass of @xmath46 . given these choices , the dark matter , gas , and star particles",
    "are all of roughly equal mass , and central cusps in the dark matter and bulge profiles are reasonably well resolved ( see fig 2 . in springel et al .",
    "the galaxies are then set to collide in a prograde encounter with zero orbital energy and a small pericenter separation ( @xmath47 for the a3 simulation ) .",

    "we similarly test different numbers of rays and find that the distribution of line - of - sight properties converges for @xmath53 rays .",
    "given the local gas properties , we use the gadget multiphase model of the ism described in @xcite to calculate the local mass fraction in `` hot '' ( diffuse ) and `` cold '' ( molecular and hi cloud core ) phases of dense gas and , assuming pressure equilibrium between the two phases , we obtain the local density of the hot and cold phase gas and the corresponding volume filling factors .",

    "we denote the neutral and total column densities as @xmath58  and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "using only the hot - phase density allows us to place an effective lower limit on the column density along a particular line of sight , as it assumes a ray passes only through the diffuse ism , with @xmath60 of the mass of the dense ism concentrated in cold - phase `` clumps . ''",

    "we ignore the inferred ionized fraction of the gas , as it is expected that the inner - shell electrons which dominate the photoelectric absorption edges will be unaffected in the temperature ranges of interest .",
    "we do not perform a full radiative transfer calculation , and therefore do not model scattering or re - processing of radiation by dust in the infrared .",
    "we quantify the quasar lifetime @xmath8  as in @xcite , as a function of the limiting b - band luminosity @xmath67 .",

    "we consider both the intrinsic lifetime @xmath69 , the total time the intrinsic @xmath70 ( ignoring attenuation ) , and the observed lifetime derived from a particular column density calculation .",
    "we note that below 5 myr ( the simulation output frequency in the standard case ) our estimates of @xmath8  become uncertain owing to the effects of quasar variability and our inability to resolve the local small - scale physics of the ism .",

    "the thick solid lines indicate the median observed lifetime , with thin lines giving the 25%-75% contours .",
    "lifetimes are calculated using : ( a ) cold - phase ism density , ( b ) hot - phase density ( ignoring metallicity and ionization ) , ( c ) hot - phase density ( including metallicity and ionization ) , ( d ) hot - phase density with artificially low metallicity ( 0.1 times solar ) .",
    "[ fig : comparenhcalc],width=326 ]    figure  [ fig : comparenhcalc ] shows the lifetime obtained in the a3 simulation using different calculations of the column density @xmath58  ( cases @xmath75 ) . the uppermost curve in all cases is the intrinsic lifetime @xmath69 .",
    "the lower thick curve is the median observed lifetime calculated using a particular estimate of the column density , with the thin curves representing the 25%-75% inclusion contours . the cold - phase ism density ( @xmath76 ) is large enough for the quasar to be completely extincted out of observable ranges for the duration of the quasar phase , rendering the object observable only during quiescent phases with @xmath77 .",
    "we also show the significantly longer lifetimes calculated using the hot - phase ism density , first ignoring corrections for metallicity and ionization ( @xmath78 ; i.e.  assuming @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) and then including these effects ( @xmath81 ) , which increases the median lifetime by a factor @xmath82 and significantly reduces the scatter towards shorter lifetimes .",
    "finally , we calculate the lifetime using the hot - phase density and an smc - like gas - to - dust ratio , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ; essentially assuming a metallicity @xmath85 times solar ) , which sets a strong upper limit on the observed lifetime .",
    "these lifetimes are still only @xmath82 times as long as the lifetimes calculated using metallicity - weighted neutral column densities , and still @xmath86 the intrinsic lifetime at @xmath72 .",
    "we therefore expect that , after accounting for the clumping of most mass in the cold phase of the most dense regions of the ism , the qualitative relation between our observed and intrinsic calculated lifetimes should be relatively insensitive to the details of the column density calculation , with variation by a factor of @xmath87 between lifetimes calculated using different prescriptions for the multiphase ism , ionization , and metallicity effects .",
    "we expect the intrinsic quasar lifetime above a given luminosity in a particular band to change with the frequency of that band .",
    "the shift in lifetime with frequency is approximately given by an offset in luminosity corresponding to the difference in luminosities at different frequencies in our model quasar spectrum .",

    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : lifetimevsfreq ] shows the lifetimes in the soft and hard x - ray bands , defined as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "we find that the soft x - ray band is heavily attenuated and has much shorter observed than intrinsic lifetimes , primarily owing to photoelectric absorption .",
    "however , the hard x - ray band is relatively unaffected , as the hot - phase column densities tend to be well below the compton - thick regime @xmath94 .",
    "thus , most quasars obscured in the optical for much of their high accretion rate lifetimes should be observable in hard x - rays .",
    "we defer a full treatment of the difference between the attenuation of soft and hard x - rays to a future paper , but note that this difference may account for the slope of the cosmic x - ray background , with a population of obscured quasars at spectral energies @xmath95 a few kev as a natural stage in the evolution of quasar activity .",
    "given a calculation of the column density along multiple lines - of - sight to the simulated quasars , we can examine the typical column density distributions at all times and at times in which the quasar is observed above some luminosity threshold .",
    "following the analysis in @xcite , we expect the characteristic column densities to rise rapidly during the merger , as gas inflow traces and fuels a rising accretion rate .",
    "eventually , column densities rapidly fall in a blowout phase once the black hole has reached a critical mass , creating a window with rapidly changing column densities in which the quasar is observable until accretion rates drop below those necessary to fuel quasar activity .",

    "our estimate of the distribution of @xmath58  for @xmath98 does not account for an additional selection effect , namely that strongly reddened quasars may not be extincted from an observed sample ( if the intrinsic luminosity is large enough ) , but their colors may be significantly reddened to the point where color selection criteria of quasar surveys will not include them .",
    "however , this effect would only serve to bring our distribution into better agreement with observations , as it would slightly lower the high-@xmath58  tail .",
    "moreover , our estimates of the distribution of @xmath58  allow us to make a directly observable prediction , namely that the column density distribution in optically selected samples with a minimum absolute magnitude or luminosity should broaden in both directions ( to larger and smaller @xmath58 ) as the limiting selection luminosity is decreased ( limiting absolute magnitude increased ) .",
    "this is because , at lower luminosities , observers will see both intrinsically bright periods extincted by larger column densities ( broadening the distribution to larger @xmath58  values ) and intrinsically faint periods with small column densities ( broadening the distribution to smaller @xmath58  values ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath59  values in hard x - ray quasar samples , which are much less affected by this extinction ( see  3 ) , should also reflect this trend , and indeed the distribution of @xmath59  values is much broader and flatter , with quasars seen from @xmath105 @xcite .",

    "although mean column densities increase somewhat with increasing mass , the functional form of the @xmath58distribution remains similar at each limiting luminosity , implying that a combined population of quasars similar to those we have simulated will match the observed @xmath58  distribution with appropriate selection effects accounted for as in figure  [ fig : nhdistrib ] .",
    "finally , we note that although we do not see extremely large column densities @xmath108 in the distributions from our simulations , our model does not rule out such values .",
    "it is possible that very bright quasars in unusually massive galaxies or quasars in higher - redshift , compact galaxies which we have not simulated may , during peak accretion periods , reach such values in their typical column densities .",

    "the observed @xmath8  is significantly smaller than the intrinsic lifetime for all @xmath125 , and the ratio @xmath126 decreases with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "however , both the intrinsic and observed lifetimes increase systematically at a given @xmath127 with increasing galaxy and black hole mass , and the peak luminosity similarly increases , as expected . in all cases corresponding to quasar - like luminosities ,",
    "our estimates of observed lifetimes of @xmath118 agree well with observations , with much longer intrinsic lifetimes @xmath128 .    a quasar accreting and radiating at the eddington limit , with luminosity increasing exponentially up to some peak luminosity @xmath129 after which accretion shuts off , will spend an integrated time above a given luminosity @xmath130 given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the salpeter time , @xmath133yr at the eddington rate with our efficiency @xmath25 , and @xmath129 is given by the eddington luminosity of the final black hole mass .",
    "this lifetime agrees well with the plotted lifetimes for simulations a3 , a4 , and a5 at the high - luminosity end .",
    "however , simulations a1 and a2 do not radiate at their eddington limits for a long period of time , and the slope of this relation is too shallow in all cases , underpredicting the time that the simulation spends at luminosities @xmath134 .",

    "the calculated , fitted , and eddington - limit approximated lifetimes are also shown for comparison for the a3 simulation .",
    "the lifetimes are well - fitted by power laws in this range , and the discrepancy between the power - law and eddington - limit approximated lifetimes at lower luminosities is clear .",
    "the slope of both the intrinsic and observed lifetimes becomes shallower at higher black hole masses , as the lifetime increases for all luminosities and extends to higher peak luminosities , but the slope of the observed lifetime evolves much more rapidly than the slope of the intrinsic lifetime . over the range of our simulations ,",
    "the intrinsic lifetime slope can be approximated as @xmath143 , or @xmath144 .",
    "although the fluctuation in the normalization @xmath142 is large for observed lifetimes , there does not appear to be a systematic trend with final black hole mass , which is expected as by luminosities of this level or lower , the lifetime is dominated by the quiescent - phase lifetime throughout the duration of the simulation .",
    "this is especially clear in the normalization of the intrinsic lifetimes , which also show no systematic trend and are all within a factor of @xmath145 two of 2 gyr , the approximate total duration of the simulations .    in order to obtain a lower limit to quasar lifetimes at low luminosities , we repeat this analysis , but ignore all times prior to the intrinsically bright quasar phase ( essentially the final merger )",
    "this excludes the luminosity of the black hole as it grows from its small seed mass , and ignores the periods of accretion with high gas fractions early in the merger , giving a lower limit corresponding to an already - large black hole suddenly `` turning on '' in a quasar phase .",
    "as expected , the eddington - limited phase of the lifetime is more dominant in this case .",
    "however , the pure eddington - limited model still gives lifetimes too short by an order of magnitude at low luminosities .",
    "fitting to power laws we find very similar relations to those shown in figure  [ fig : pwrlawfits ] , with slightly shallower slopes , @xmath146 for the intrinsic lifetime , and normalization @xmath147gyr .",
    "we further fit one additional functional form to the intrinsic lifetimes , in which the lifetime follows the eddington - limited shape for large luminosities , down to some luminosity @xmath148 , and below this luminosity follows a power - law .",
    "this allows a continuous description of the lifetime , very accurate at both low and near - peak luminosities . for these fits",
    ", we find similar power - law slopes @xmath149 , with @xmath150 nearly constant .",
    "we also fit the lifetimes as a function of frequency for the representative visual wavelengths shown in figure  [ fig : lifetimevsfreq ] .",
    "although , as expected from the figure , the observed lifetime slopes become slightly shallower and the intrinsic lifetime slopes become slightly steeper as the quasar is observed at redder wavelengths , the change with wavelength across this range is very small compared to the change with black hole mass .",
    "moreover , the change in normalization @xmath142 across visual wavelengths is consistent with zero .",
    "we therefore find that quasar lifetimes can be well approximated by simple power laws , where the power law slope depends on the final black hole mass or peak luminosity of a system , and find significantly longer lifetimes at low luminosities than predicted by simple models of accretion at a constant eddington ratio .",
    "furthermore , attempts to de - convolve intrinsic quasar properties and observations as well as semi - analytical attempts to model observable quasar luminosity functions and statistics require an accurate model of quasar lifetimes as a function of luminosity and host system properties . the fits",
    "we describe have the advantage of a simple , analytical form which can be applied to a continuum of luminosities and intrinsic quasar properties , while addressing the shortcomings of simpler lifetime models below peak system luminosities .",
    "in this paper , we have studied implications of the conclusion of @xcitethat incorporating the effects of obscuration in a galaxy merger simulation gives observed quasar lifetimes of @xmath118 .",
    "we extended our analysis to a series of five simulations with virial velocities @xmath151 , producing a range of final black hole masses from @xmath152 , and find qualitatively similar results in all cases and for different determinations of the obscuring column density .",
    "the good agreement with observations and the significant difference between observed and much longer intrinsic lifetimes is found in all our simulations .",
    "the qualitative evolution of quasars in this model is robust , with the result reproduced across a range of galaxy masses , and using different methods for calculating column densities that can give factors greater than an order of magnitude different attenuations along any given line of sight at a particular time .",
    "we therefore expect that quasars will have extended intrinsic lifetimes , much of which are obscured in visual wavelengths .",
    "the processes which fuel periods of quasar activity by channeling significant quantities of gas into the central regions of a galaxy will produce this extended intrinsic lifetime of @xmath153yr .",
    "however , for a significant fraction of the intrinsic lifetime for quasar activity , this same process will produce large column densities which heavily obscure the quasar and attenuate it well below observable limits in the b - band and other visual wavelengths .",
    "eventually , feedback from accretion energy will remove surrounding gas , creating a window in which the quasar is optically observable before accretion rates drop below those needed to maintain quasar luminosities .    of course",
    ", not all aspects of agn activity are related to mergers .",
    "for example , some low redshift quasars ( e.g. bahcall et al . 1996 ) and many seyferts appear to reside in relatively ordinary galaxies .",
    "gas expelled by quasar feedback may cool and relax to the central regions of the galaxy , and passive stellar evolution can produce a large fuel supply in winds . in our picture , it is most natural to interpret occurrences of agn activity that are not caused by mergers as arising from normal galaxies being re - activated as gas is sporadically accreted by a black hole created earlier in a bright quasar phase .",
    "the principle requirement of this modeling is that such activity should not contribute a large fraction of the black hole mass , to avoid spoiling tight correlations between the black hole and host galaxy properties or overproducing the present - day density of very massive black holes .",
    "radiative heating from the final stages of quasar activity may suppress much of this activity ( much of the remaining gas is heated to very high temperatures ; e.g.  cox et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the hydrodynamical modeling of @xcite demonstrates that residual accretion from stellar feedback and `` cooling flows '' is dramatically suppressed by even relatively small agn feedback once the black hole has reached a critical mass determined by the @xmath19-@xmath5 relation .",
    "further , demographic arguments such as that of @xcite , as well as more detailed analysis by e.g. , @xcite implies that most of the present black hole mass density is accumulated in bright quasar phases , for which our modeling should be most applicable .",
    "this remains true in our analysis , and we demonstrate in hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005b , c ) that our modeling can account for the entire quasar luminosity function in different frequencies , although we defer a detailed prediction of the resulting supermassive black hole density and mass function to a future paper .",
    "it is important to note , however , that given our prediction of an obscured accretion phase with a duration up to @xmath154 times that of the optically observable phase , a naive application of the @xcite or other demographic arguments would imply a similar increase in the black hole mass density accumulated in obscured quasar phases .",
    "but this neglects both the fact that black holes are growing during this phase and the luminosity dependence of the quasar lifetime .",
    "a more detailed calculation shows that a large fraction ( @xmath155 in the brightest quasars ) of the quasar mass is accumulated in the optically observable stages of black hole growth when the final @xmath15-folding of exponential black hole growth occurs as the black hole begins to drive strong feedback and soon shuts down accretion .",
    "similarly , most of the total black hole radiated energy is emitted in this stage , with a considerable fraction ( @xmath156 ) observable .",
    "thus , we expect that corrections to the estimates of black hole growth from demographic arguments based on observations of bright , relatively unobscured quasars will in fact only be of order unity from our modeling , and thus should not conflict with theoretical limits .",
    "it is still an interesting and important question , however , to determine from our modeling the implied relic agn density and constraints from the combination of observed luminosity functions and black hole mass functions .",
    "we do not expect other considerations , such as the orbital parameters of the merger or the collimation of black hole feedback , to substantially change our results .",
    "different orbital separations , orientations , and energies will change the time of interaction , but ultimately our model for quasar evolution depends only on the merger eventually depositing sufficient gas into the central regions of the remnant to fuel rapid black hole growth .",
    "after such a process begins , the evolution of the black hole should be determined by the self - regulated mechanisms which terminate black hole growth , as described in @xcite .",
    "this will eventually expel gas , rendering the quasar observable and shutting down the accretion phase at the final black hole mass given by the @xmath19-@xmath5 relation .",
    "the phase of rapid black hole growth and the expulsion of gas in the final stages of strong accretion occur during the end - stages of the merger and in the very center of the merging cores , when and where the structure of the original orbits should be least important .",
    "this view is supported by additional simulations not presented here but shown in e.g. fig .",
    "16 of @xcite , demonstrating that the final black hole mass is relatively insensitive to orbital parameters .",
    "the exact mechanism of black hole feedback should similarly not dramatically change this picture , so long as a period of rapid black hole growth occurs , requiring large densities ( which naturally generate obscuring column densities ) , and ultimately terminates via some self - regulated mechanism which expels gas from central regions , rendering the quasar optically observable in the final stages of its life .",
    "in particular , collimation of the black hole feedback may significantly increase the energy or momentum input on - axis , `` blowing out '' material along this axis earlier in the quasar lifetime .",
    "however , since the black hole is growing exponentially during peak accretion , this should occur at most on the order of a couple of salpeter times ( during which the black hole luminosity grows by an order of magnitude ) before it would in the isotropic case , changing the intrinsic lifetime by only a fraction of its total .",
    "the unobscured stage of the quasar lifetime may then begin slightly earlier along on - axis sightlines , but should be of comparable duration as a similar mechanism removes the gas from central regions .",
    "in addition , in order for significant black hole growth to cease at the same critical mass as in the isotropic case ( determined by the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation ) , the high - accretion rate phase must end over the same timescale @xmath157 as the `` lead '' with which collimated , on - axis blowout precedes isotropic blowout .",
    "the necessity that self - regulation eventually terminates accretion implies that surrounding densities , even off - axis , must decrease , resulting in at most a broadening of the column density distribution as typical column densities off - axis could be somewhat larger than column densities on - axis .    for much of this regime",
    ", we find that the source should be observable in hard x - ray frequencies , as the attenuation is weaker and column densities generally lie below the compton thick limit .",
    "this distinction naturally produces a substantial population of obscured quasars , as a standard phase in the evolution of quasars over their lifetimes .",
    "although we defer a detailed calculation of the quasar luminosity function as a function of redshift and in different observed frequencies ( hopkins et al .",
    "2005b ) , we note that such a population can naturally account for both the cosmic x - ray background spectrum and discrepancies between optical and x - ray luminosity functions at various redshifts ( hopkins et al .",
    "moreover , optical and x - ray observational samples will be affected rather differently by selection effects and magnitude limits , especially for quasars near their peak luminosities .",
    "therefore , the differences in the evolution of optical and x - ray selected samples may be accounted for through the dependence of obscuration on intrinsic luminosity and host galaxy properties .",
    "attenuation is also weaker in the infrared , and the large fraction of optical and uv energy absorbed during the obscured phase may be reprocessed by dust , appearing as thermal radiation in the ir .",
    "this may render the observable lifetime larger than the intrinsic lifetime at long wavelengths , an effect important for calculating the ir background and estimating source populations .",
    "similarly , the total obscuration and obscuration as a function of intrinsic luminosity are important for the evolution of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies , and for estimating the relative energy contributions in the ir of starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the typical column densities in our simulations correspond well to observed column densities of optically selected quasars , once the appropriate observed magnitude limit has been imposed .",
    "thus , our model allows us to reproduce the distribution of optically obscured sources above this magnitude limit naturally , as an evolutionary effect of the mechanisms which fuel and regulate quasar growth , without invoking particular distributions of source properties or geometric patterns of obscuration .",
    "moreover , the column densities we calculate in our simulations allow us to predict that the distribution of @xmath59  values should become broader as the minimum observable luminosity is decreased , as both faint , quiescent phases with low ( @xmath158 ) column densities and bright , obscured phases with high ( @xmath159 ) column densities become observable .",
    "this effect is seen in the broad distribution of @xmath59  values in x - ray samples , which are much less affected by attenuation , but a more detailed analysis including modeling the distribution of quasar properties is needed to reproduce both the optical and x - ray @xmath59  distributions more accurately .",
    "we find that the peak luminosities and lifetime above any given luminosity increase systematically with galaxy mass and final black hole mass , although the distinction between observed and intrinsic lifetimes remains significant in all cases .",
    "moreover , the ratio of observed to intrinsic lifetimes decreases in all cases with increasing minimum luminosity .",
    "we also find that intrinsic lifetimes at luminosities @xmath160 times the peak luminosity are poorly fit by assuming quasars always accrete near the eddington limit , but rather that lifetimes are well - fitted by power laws with a steeper slope .",
    "this is a result of sub - eddington accretion rates both before and after the peak accretion phase , even at luminosities significantly above the quiescent steady - state small accretion rates seen at late times in the simulations .",
    "this suggests that many quasars seen at low luminosities may be quasars with a large peak luminosity in a significantly sub - eddington phase , although the fraction of quasars observed at high eddington ratios becomes large with increasing luminosity .",
    "additionally , these lifetimes imply that , even at high luminosities where growth may be eddington - limited , quasars spend a significant fraction of their lives with intrinsic luminosities well below their peak luminosities . therefore , any observed luminosity function is the convolution of the distribution of quasars with a given peak luminosity ( determined by the final black hole mass and thus the merging galaxy properties ) and a non - trivial light curve ( hopkins et al .",
    "it is clear from these calculations that any attempt to theoretically model even the intrinsic luminosity functions of quasars must take into account the functional dependence of the light curve on luminosity and time . in order to apply these models to observed luminosity functions , the dependence of observed luminosity on intrinsic luminosity and the quasar evolution , as well as the observed frequency , must be considered ( hopkins et al . 2005b , c ) .",
    "we find that the ratio of observable to intrinsic lifetimes is a strongly decreasing function of the limiting luminosity of observations .",
    "modeling this effect is necessary to estimate intrinsic quasar lifetimes from observations , as well as for using theoretically motivated accretion models to predict the quasar luminosity function and space density of present - day supermassive black holes .",
    "further , the effects we describe can account for the presence of an obscured population of quasars which are missed by optical , uv , or soft x - ray surveys but may contribute significantly to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "observations of the cosmic x - ray background and comparison of the optical and hard x - ray quasar luminosity functions that indicate the existence of a large obscured population of quasars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , is explained in our picture , because it predicts different observed lifetimes and populations at different frequencies .",
    "the scenario we describe also implies that the reprocessing of quasar radiation by dust in surrounding regions can account for observations of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies with merger activity and obscured agn .",

    "occurs , optical quasar activity would be buried , but x - rays from the black holes explain the presence of non - thermal point sources in e.g. ngc 6240 @xcite , and reprocessing of most of the black hole energy by surrounding gas and dust can , in principle , account for the spectral energy distributions of `` warm '' ulirgs ( sanders et al .",

    "<S> based on numerical simulations of gas - rich galaxy mergers , we discuss a model in which quasar activity is tied to the self - regulated growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies . the nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth , but for most of the duration of the starburst , the black hole is `` buried '' , being heavily obscured by surrounding gas and dust , limiting the visibility of the quasar , especially at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths . as the black hole grows , feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and eventually expels it in a powerful wind , leaving behind a `` dead quasar '' . in between the buried and dead phases </S>",
    "<S> , there is a window in time during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous quasar . </S>",
    "<S> because the black hole mass , radiative output , and distribution of obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time , the duration of this phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed luminosity threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a function of luminosity and frequency , and calculate observable lifetimes @xmath0myr for bright quasars in the optical b - band , in good agreement with empirical estimates and much smaller than our estimated black hole growth timescales @xmath1myr , naturally producing a substantial population of buried quasars . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the ir and hard x - ray bands as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which the quasar is seen above a given luminosity , and find that our result agrees remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from the sdss for the appropriate luminosity thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> our model reproduces a wide range of quasar phenomena , including observed quasar lifetimes , intrinsic lifetimes , column density distributions , and differences between optical and x - ray samples , having properties consistent with observations across more than five orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity from @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . </S>"
