    "subdwarf o ( sdo ) stars cover a domain of approximately 60000  k in @xmath0 and 2.5  dex in @xmath1 in the hot and high gravity domain of the hr diagram . due to the wide spread of physical parameters",
    "their evolutionary stage is not completely understood , but some progress has recently been made with larger than ever ( comprising up to a hundred sdos ) spectroscopic studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "determinations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and helium abundance allowed @xcite to make some statistical correlations between position in the hr and evolutionary stage , and as a result they propose that sdos come from a mixed population of post - ehb ( i.e. sdb descendants ) , post - agb and post - rgb objects .",
    "the canonical picture depicts them as objects of about half a solar mass with an inert carbon - oxygen core , and helium and hydrogen burning layers .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have plotted the radial and horizontal displacement eigenfunctions for the original model _",
    "p_-modes with maximum ( _ p_9 ) , intermediate ( _ p_8 ) and minimum ( _ p_7 ) total kinetic energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p9p8p7y1y2 ] ) .",
    "we found that all modes show higher amplitude in the envelope , as expected for _ p_-modes .",
    "we found that the _ p_9 mode shows the highest amplitude in the outer envelope for the 3 modes under comparison .",
    "however , ultimately what accounts for the higher total kinetic energy is the higher amplitude of the eigenfunctions in the innermost layers of the star , where the mode is trapped due to the pinching effect of the c - o / he interface on the eigenfunctions .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : indecinet - trabajop9p8p7 ] ( left ) that shows the local contribution to the kinetic energy of the trapped , normal and confined modes , _",
    "p_8 , _ p_7",
    ", respectively , normalised to the maximum of _",
    "p7_. although not shown for the sake of clarity , the maximum kinetic energy value for the _ p_9 trapped mode reaches one order of magnitude higher .",
    "the plot of the differential work for a trapped , normal and confined mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : indecinet - trabajop9p8p7 ] , right ) shows that significant energy interchange is only produced at the z - bump ; and there , driving is higher for the trapped mode . as it is the case for low - radial order _",
    "g_-modes , a maximum in kinetic energy does not translate into a minimum growth rate value for the mode .",
    "this is explained by the maximum kinetic energy being due to a higher amplitude of the eigenfunctions in the region @xmath2 , which for _ p_-modes does not have significant influence on driving .",
    "neither do the higher amplitudes of the eigenfunctions of the trapped mode at the driving region lead to a maximum growth rate value , as consecutive higher radial order modes have even higher amplitudes .",
    "we conclude that the influence of the work function prevails over the influence of the kinetic energy in the computation of the growth rate .",
    "pressure modes with higher radial orders , not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : allpkin ] , display kinetic energy monotonically increasing , an effect of the nodes accumulating in the surface limit imposed by the boundary conditions , as it is well described in @xcite .",
    "the trapping effect caused by the c - o / he transition is no longer produced , as is expected for high - radial order pure _ p_-modes propagating only in the external layers of the star .",
    "when we cancel the he / h , or the sharp peak of the c - o / he chemical transitions in the brunt - visl frequency , and also the corresponding bumps in the sound speed at these locations , we still find a kinetic energy pattern , and an oscillating profile of the growth rate , both similar to those of the original model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : allpkin ] , solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , neither the he / h , nor the c - o / he chemical transition , nor the sound speed at these locations , seem to have any significant influence on the kinetic energy or on the tendency to driving of the _ p_-modes .    this result was the expected for the growth rate , for reasons given above , but not for the kinetic energy , as we presumed the modification of the c - o / he transition would show in the kinetic energy profile , due to changes in the amplitude of the eigenfunctions . however , eigenfunction profiles similar to those of fig .",
    "[ fig : p9p8p7y1y2 ] are retained for trapped , normal and confined modes of the perturbed models .",
    "the reason may be due to that , in fact , the c - o / he transition still exists ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n2pert ] , left ) as we only cancelled out its steep peak , giving a softer profile .",
    "we conclude for the _ g_-mode spectrum that :    * high - radial order _ g_-modes are trapped in the envelope due to the he / h chemical transition .",
    "this provides a weak selection mechanism , in the way that trapped modes oscillate with lower amplitudes in the innermost damping region .",
    "thus , trapped modes show lower total kinetic energy and higher values of the growth rate . *",
    "low to intermediate radial order _ g_-modes ( mixed modes ) are also trapped in the envelope by the he / h transition . however , this has no significant effects on the driving , as the innermost damping region , at the frequencies at which low _ g_-modes occur , has no significant weight in the energy interchanged by the mode with its surroundings . * cancelling out the he / h transition region cancels the mode trapping effects of high order gravity modes , and the growth rate loses its oscillatory behaviour with frequency , as expected . however , modes with local maxima in the kinetic energy and similar interchanged energy at the driving region than their non - perturbed counterparts , achieve higher growth rate values .",
    "this effect is due to the presence of a small but strong damping region in the original model at the location of he / h chemical transition , which has an overall damping effect in the high - radial order _",
    "g_-modes of the original model . for low radial order gravity modes some remnant trapping still exists which may be attributed to the c - o / he transition .",
    "* when we cancel out the sharp peak of the c - o / he transition region , keeping the he / h peak , mode trapping is still present for high order _ g_-modes , and also the oscillating behaviour of the growth rate .",
    "thus , the c - o / he transition region has no significant role in their trapping .",
    "however , it may play a subtle role in low order _ g_-mode trapping ( seen in certain alterations to the total kinetic energy ) , due to the persistence of the transition . trapping though , has no effect in their driving .",
    "+ we also have to bear in mind that although the brunt - visl frequency is expected to have a higher weight in the mode trapping , the contribution of the sound speed has not been disentangled in the analysis and may be responsible in part for certain aspects of trapping .",
    "we conclude for the _ p_-mode spectrum that :    * low to intermediate radial order _ p_-modes ( mixed modes ) are found to be trapped by the c / o - he transition in the innermost region . however , this has no significant effects on the driving as the maximum energy interchanged is produced in the envelope of the star . *",
    "cancelling out the he / h or the sharp peak of the c - o / he transition has no significant effect neither in the mode trapping , nor in the growth rate profile , which remain essentially unaltered .",
    "this is interpreted as trapping effects produced by the remaining piece of the c - o / he transition .",
    "a sdo model presented an oscillating profile of the growth rate with frequency , which lead us to analyse it in more detail : it was found that gravity modes suffered mode trapping effects caused by the he / h chemical transition region which made high - order _ g_-trapped modes more likely to be driven .",
    "mode trapping was also found for low - radial order _",
    "p_-modes , caused by the deep c - o / he chemical interface .",
    "however , no obvious correlation could be made with its possible non - adiabatic effects .",
    "we sought to investigate the non - adiabatic effects of mode trapping through the influence of the kinetic energy on the growth rate behaviour .",
    "up to now , the existing adiabatic studies for sdbs @xcite qualitatively proposed that , as a trapped mode had lower amplitude in the damping regions , the mode would be less damped and would be more likely to be excited .",
    "indeed , this is what we found in our non - adiabatic study for trapped in the envelope high - radial order _",
    "g_-modes : they oscillate with lower amplitudes below the he / h transition , a damping region , hence they have higher values of the growth rate than its confined counterparts . in this way , mode trapping acts a weak selection mechanism rendering trapped modes more likely to be driven",
    ".    meanwhile , low- to intermediate - radial order _ p_-modes , which show a similar behaviour of the growth rate , were found to be trapped by the c - o / he transition .",
    "however , as the significant energy interchange at _",
    "p_-mode frequencies is produced much higher in the envelope , mode trapping under the c - o / he interface does not play a significant role in the potential to destabilise modes .",
    "therefore , we conclude that mode trapping is a potential aid for destabilizing modes when ( 1 ) modes are trapped in such a way that they have lower amplitude in a damping region and ( 2 ) this region plays a significant role in the energy interchanged by the mode with its surroundings .    finally , a tentative exercise of a theoretical mode identification of the radial order of the observed modes of j1600 + 0748 was done in the terms of asymptotic analysis , based on the similar mean frequency spacing of our model 8 and the observed frequencies .",
    "we associated the latter with those showing highest growth rate in model 8 , and gaps in the observed frequencies to modes with minimum growth rate .",
    "this resulted in the observed modes associated with high radial - order _",
    "p_-modes , in contradiction with low - order low - degree mode identification by fontaine et al .",
    "however , we consider this possible application of mode trapping to explain the observed sdo pulsation spectra , a path that is worth exploring .",
    "for this exercise to be fruitful , proper theoretical models reproducing the observed physical parameters of j1600 + 0748 should be used .",
