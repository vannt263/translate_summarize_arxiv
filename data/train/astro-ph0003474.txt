    "objects as faint as @xmath7mag are expected to be observable with amber when a bright reference star is available , and as faint as @xmath8mag otherwise .    among the astrophysical key issues@xcite",
    "are , for instance , young stellar objects , active galactic nuclei and stars in late phases of stellar evolution .",
    "the simulation of a stellar object consists in principle of two components : +    ( i )    the calculation of an astrophysical model of the object , typically based on radiative transfer calculations predicting , e.g. , its intensity distribution . to obtain a robust and non - ambiguous model ,",

    ", we calculated a detailed radiative transfer model for one of its most outstanding representatives , the supergiant irc+10420 , and carried out computer simulations of vlti visibility measurements . the goal is to estimate how accurate visibilities can be measured with the vlti in this particular but not untypical case , to discuss if the accuracy is sufficient to distinguish between different theoretical model predictions and to study on what the accuracy is dependent .",
    "the star irc+10420",
    "(= v1302  aql = iras19244 + 1115 ) is an outstanding object for the study of stellar evolution .",
    "its spectral type changed from f8i@xmath9 in 1973@xcite to mid - a today@xcite corresponding to an effective temperature increase of 1000 - 2000k within only 25yr .",

    "we will briefly describe the main results and conclusions of this study which will serve as astrophysical input for the vlti computer simulations presented in the next section .",
    "speckle interferograms of irc+10420 were obtained with the russian 6 m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory on june 13 and 14 , 1998@xcite .",
    "the speckle data were recorded with our nicmos-3 speckle camera through an interference filter with a centre wavelength of 2.11@xmath6 m and a bandwidth of 0.19@xmath6 m .",

    "the gau  fit fwhm diameter of the dust shell was determined to be @xmath18mas . by comparison ,",
    "previous 3.8 m telescope k - band observations@xcite found a dust - shell flux contribution of @xmath1450% and @xmath19mas .",

    "the code has been expanded for the calculation of synthetic visibilities .",
    "c    we calculated various models of the dust shell of irc+10420 considering black bodies and model atmospheres as central sources of radiation , different silicates , grain - size and density distributions .",
    "we refer to blcker et al .",
    "@xcite for a full description of the model grid .",
    "the remaining fit parameters are the dust temperature , @xmath32 , which determines the radius of the shell s inner boundary , @xmath33 , and the optical depth , @xmath34 , at a given reference wavelength , @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to @xmath36 m .",
    "models were calculated for dust temperatures between 400 and 1000k and optical depths between 1 and 12 .",
    "significantly larger values for @xmath34 lead to silicate features in absorption .",
    "the near - infrared visibility strongly constrains dust shell models since it is , e.g. , a sensitive indicator of the grain size .",
    "accordingly , high - resolution interferometry results provide essential ingredients for models of circumstellar dust - shells . in the instance of irc+10420 ( assuming the central star to be a black body of @xmath37k ) , the silicate@xcite grain sizes , @xmath38 , were found to be in accordance with a standard distribution function@xcite , @xmath39@xmath14@xmath40 , with @xmath38 ranging between @xmath41=0.005@xmath6 m and @xmath42=0.45@xmath6 m .",
    "however , the observed dust shell properties can not be fitted by single - shell models but seem to require multiple components . at a certain distance we considered an enhancement over the assumed @xmath43 density distribution .",
    "the best model for _ both _ sed _ and _ visibility was found for a dust shell with a dust temperature of 1000k at its inner radius of @xmath44 . at a distance of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) the density was enhanced by a factor of @xmath47 and and its density exponent was changed from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "these fits for sed and 2.11@xmath6 m visibility are shown in fig .",
    "[ fsedvisidens17 ] .",
    "the various flux contributions at 2.11@xmath6 m are 62.2% stellar light , 26.1% scattered radiation and 10.7% dust emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fffraction17 ] ) , i.e. the radiation emitted by the circumstellar shell itself consists of 71% scattered radiation and 29% direct dust emission . the shell s model intensity distribution is shown in fig .  [ fffraction17 ] and was found to be ring - like .",
    "this appears to be typical for optically thin shells ( here @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) showing limb - brightened dust - condensation zones .",
    "accordingly , the interpretation of the observational data by fwhm gaudiameters may give misleading results .",
    "the ring diameter is equal to the inner diameter of the hot shell ( @xmath52mas ) , and the diameter of the central star amounts to @xmath53mas . the bolometric flux , @xmath54 , is @xmath55wm@xmath56 corresponding to a central - star luminosity of @xmath57 .",
    "this two - component model can be interpreted in terms of a termination of an enhanced mass - loss phase roughly 90 yr ( for @xmath58kpc ) ago .",
    "the assumption that irc+10420 had passed through a superwind phase in its recent history is in line with its evolutionary status of an object in transition from the red - supergiant to the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "the mass - loss rates of the components can be determined to be @xmath59@xmath60 and @xmath61@xmath60 .",
    "in the previous section , the spatial intensity profile of the dusty supergiant irc+10420 ( see fig .  [ fffraction17 ] ) was derived by means of radiative transfer models and their comparison with photometric and interferometric observations .",
    "this @xmath31 m intensity profile will serve as object intensity profile in the simulation of monochromatic vlti observations .",
    "the next steps are the simulation of light propagation from the object to the detector ( through atmosphere , telescopes , and the amber wide - field mode instrument ) , simulation of photon noise and detector read - out noise , and finally data processing of the interferograms . a schematic view of michelson interferometry with the vlti and the amber camera is given in fig .",

    "after the simulation of the entrance pupil , the next step incorporates the tip - tilt correction but we allow for a residual tip - tilt error @xmath63 . in the next step",

    "the output pupil is chosen such that ( i ) in the optical transfer function the off - axis peaks are separated from the central peak , and ( ii ) the interferograms are sampled with the smallest number of pixels to assure the lowest influence of detector noise .",
