    "the common paradigm that globular clusters ( gcs ) are examples of `` simple stellar populations '' ( ssp ) , assemblies of stars born all at the same time and sharing identical chemical composition , had until a few years ago only one noticeable exception : @xmath1  cen , the most massive cluster , whose stars show a large spread in metallicity . today , the situation is much more complex , and it is now clear that practically none of the gcs so far examined in detail is an ssp . even when all the stars in a single gc share the same fe abundance , star - to - star differences in the abundances of lighter elements are found .",
    "these differences concern light - element abundances : in a relevant fraction of cluster stars , they look like the result of nuclear processing through proton capture reactions at high temperature ( cn , on , nena and mgal cycles ) .",
    "in particular , o - na and mg - al anticorrelations are found for stars at different stages of their evolution , from the red giant branch to the main sequence ( ms ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "halo field stars with the same metallicity do not show such huge variations @xcite .",
    "this leads us to attribute the anomalous composition to the fact that these stars formed in a dense gc environment , and that nuclear processing in a first stellar generation ( hereafter fg ) , has been followed by a subsequent episode of star formation , creating a second stellar generation ( hereafter sg ) from matter including this processed gas .",
    "an additional ingredient to the complexity of the new scenario has been added by recognizing that there are at least two clusters , @xmath1  cen  and ngc  2808 , in which the ms morphology shows that a non negligible fraction of the stars ( @xmath225% in @xmath1  cen  , @xmath215% in ngc  2808 ) populate a `` blue ms '' which can only be interpreted as a very helium - rich ms @xcite .",
    "the extreme helium population must also be very _ homogeneous _",
    ", both in helium and metal content , since in both clusters the blue ms is well detached from the rest of the main sequence . @xcite",
    "have shown that the ms of ngc  2808 is actually made up of three different sequences : a normal ms , a population with somewhat enriched helium ( y@xmath2 0.30 ) and a very helium - rich one ( y@xmath20.350.40 ) . in @xmath1",
    "cen  the `` normal '' ms is actually made up of sequences with different metal content , as also shown by the complexity of the subgiant branch(es ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to @xmath1  cen  and ngc  2808 , the two massive clusters ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 apparently also harbor a very high helium population , including @xmath3% and @xmath4% of stars respectively . in this case",
    "the evidence comes from the high - t@xmath5   extension of the horizontal branch ( hb ) @xcite , a very peculiar occurrence at the high metallicity of these clusters @xcite , and it is not clear whether the very high helium population is as homogeneous as it is in the previous cases .",
    "observationally , it appears that these extreme y sequences are present only in the most massive clusters @xcite .",
    "a moderately helium rich population ( @xmath6 ) , on the other hand , is present in most gcs , largely independent of the total cluster mass .",
    "the observational spectroscopic evidence resides mainly in the existence of similar na ",
    "o anticorrelation also among the unevolved stars in all the clusters so far examined ( see , e.g. , the summary by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although the most extreme na  o anomalies are present only in clusters that also show extreme high - t@xmath5  extensions of the hb ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these results , based generally on spectroscopy of a few stars , have been recently confirmed by the analysis of larger samples of 30100 stars per cluster ( carretta et al . , 2008 ) the indications coming from the analysis of the cno anomalies are similar ( for a summary , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "photometrically , this non - extreme population can not be easily isolated in the ms photometry , mainly because the moderately helium rich isochrones merge with the standard isochrones in the turnoff region @xcite , but also because , in general , these sg stars do not have an unique value of y ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , these stars show up quite prominently in the hb morphology , which amplifies the mass differences ( due to the initial helium content ) among stars of the same age @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that , according to the detailed hb modelling by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also in ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 the total sg population includes @xmath7 of the total number of stars , and is therefore much larger than just the very high helium fraction population .",
    "the interpretation of the hb morphologies in terms of helium enrichment , coupled with the spectroscopic information indicating that the helium - rich samples probably coincide with the sample of stars showing the na  o anomalies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lead us to conclude that , in the clusters so far examined , the percentage of stars of the sg is generally @xmath24060% @xcite .    for the clusters having mainly blue hbs , there are even indications that they may contain only  or mainly  sg stars @xcite . in an analysis of the relative magnitude locations of the turnoff , red giant",
    "`` bump '' and hb , @xcite have provocatively suggested this possibility for m  13 , the cluster showing the broadest range of chemical anomalies @xcite . in addition , some clusters in which the tightness of the evolutionary sequences in the hr diagram ( e.g. the relatively small cluster ngc 6397 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the short extent of the hb ( e.g. the massive gc m 53 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that they indeed represent ssps , might be dominated by a _ homogeneous _",
    "for example , in ngc  6397 only three out of fourteen scarcely evolved stars examined by @xcite are normal in their nitrogen content . in the others ,",
    "[ n / fe]@xmath8 , showing cn and on processing in stars that should not show it .",
    "the blue hb of m  53 can easily be described as uniparametric @xcite , but its integrated spectrum shows a strong nitrogen enhancement with respect to field halo stars @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "some `` normal '' blue ",
    "hb gcs ( with typical current masses of a few @xmath9 ) should be considered self - enriched , and any model for the formation and evolution of multiple population clusters must be able to explain the observed large sg population and the cluster - to - cluster variations in the sg / fg number ratio .",
    "both massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite or `` fast rotating '' massive stars ( frms ) @xcite have been proposed as possible progenitors of the sg .",
    "the most critical point , common to both scenarios , is the following : for a standard initial mass function ( imf ) of the fg , such as a salpeter or kroupa imf , the gas ejected by the massive stars during the phase of h - burning , or the gas contained in the envelopes of massive agbs @xcite , is too scarce to form a large sg population .",
    "two solutions to this conundrum have been suggested : either the system had a standard imf but it was initially much more massive_at least a factor 10 more massive _ , under very conservative assumptions ( see sect .",
    "3.1)than today s gc @xcite , or the system evolves at constant mass and the imf is highly anomalous ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite for a dynamical study ) and contains a significant number of fg polluters . as we will discuss in sect .",
    "[ subsec : imf ] , a large initial mass is necessary also in this second scenario if a cluster must have today an approximately equal number of long - lived sg and fg stars ( where we define long - lived stars as those having initial masses in the range 0.1 @xmath100.8@xmath10 ) .",
    "we reconsider here the problem of gc formation to explain not only the most peculiar very helium - rich population ( 15 - 20% in three gcs , 25% in @xmath1  cen  ) , but the whole sg population ( about 4060% of the current gc stellar content , and possibly even more in the `` blue hb '' clusters ) .    in this work , we follow the idea that the intermediate  mass stars of the fg , starting at 8m@xmath11 and extending at most down to @xmath245m@xmath11 , lose by stellar winds and the ejection of planetary nebulae matter processed by the hot cno cycle via hot bottom burning ( na- and al - rich , o- and mg - poor ) during their agb evolution , and that an sg forms either from the pure agb ejecta or from ejecta mixed with pristine gas .",
    "while previous work examined the reliability of this model from a chemical point of view , here we focus mainly on its hydrodynamical and dynamical consistency .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : sgprog ] we first briefly summarize the state of the art of chemical modelling of the sg , we discuss the reasons why we focus our attention on the scenario in which the agb stars are the polluters and emphasize the possible role of super - agb stars .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : models ] and [ sec : res ] , we address this problem by means of 1d hydro simulations . we show that in the massive agb epoch , the slow winds collect in a cooling flow driving agb ejecta to the center of the cluster , where they form sg stars .",
    "simulations exploring the dependence of our results on the cluster mass , imf , initial concentration as well as the role of sne ia and other extra energy sources are also presented in this section .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : pristine ] we explore a model in which the pristine matter is partially re - accreted after the sn ii explosion stage .",
    "the stellar population forming after the accretion shows a lower helium abundance relative to the stars formed earlier from the pure ejecta of the super - agbs .",
    "this may explain the presence of the very high - helium population observed in a few , very massive gcs .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : dyn0 ] we present the results of a number of @xmath0-body simulations exploring the subsequent cluster dynamical evolution .",
    "we show that the early cluster expansion driven by mass loss due to sn ejecta leads to a strong preferential loss of fg stars .",
    "our simulations show that dynamical evolution can lead to values of the ratio of the number of sg to fg stars consistent with those suggested by observational studies .",
    "we also show possible evolutionary routes leading to the loss of most of the fg stars , leaving an sg - dominated , cluster .",
    "although the study of the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple population clusters is the main goal of this paper , one of the key assumptions of our investigation is that the sg progenitors are agb stars , a scenario which has been criticized in a few recent studies aimed at producing a plausible chemical evolution history of gcs . in this section",
    "we briefly review a number of recent studies of the chemical modeling of sg stars and discuss why the agb stars ( along with the implications of the role of super - agbs ) are still to be considered a key ingredient in any theory for the formation of a sg population .    in the last decade , attention has been focused mainly on the agb scenario , based on the simple idea that the agb winds are slow enough to be retained in the potential well of the cluster , and that these winds are processed through the hot cno cycle by `` hot bottom burning '' @xcite at the bottom of the convective envelope @xcite .",
    "many different groups have addressed the computation of suitable models for the chemical anomalies , and a number of results apparently do not support this scenario @xcite , while the model presented in @xcite is in only partial agreement with the data .    the model of sg formation by the contribution of frms has been proposed much more recently @xcite and , while it is not our goal to dismiss the frms scenario , we emphasize that many of its aspects are still to be fully explored .",
    "in particular , the main assumptions of this model are particularly stringent : all the stars must rotate at break - up speed , both to achieve a deep rotational mixing of cno processed matter in the envelope and to inject , with small or zero ejection velocity , the cno processed ejecta into the cluster , where they mix with the intracluster pristine matter @xcite .",
    "conversely , the high velocity winds during the helium - core burning phase and the supernova ejecta must leave the cluster without any interaction with the remnant gas .",
    "the hydrodynamical and dynamical aspects of the frms scenario have not been studied , and a recent vlt flames survey of massive stars , studying the nitrogen abundance and the rotational velocity of 135 b - type stars in the lmc @xcite , has found a number of unenriched fast rotators and cast some doubt on the efficiency of rotational mixing .    as far as the agb scenario is concerned , it is important to emphasize the following points . in discussing agbs",
    ", we generally think of the low - mass , thermally pulsing agbs that go through long series of thermal pulses and dredge - up episodes , so that they are generally rich in carbon and s - process elements . but these are not the agb stars that can be progenitors of the sg in clusters .",
    "some studies show that the sum of cno elements is approximately constant among fg and sg stars @xcite .",
    "this is possible only if we are dealing with _",
    "the most massive agbs _ , in which the episodes of third dredge - up are small in number , and the temperature at the base of the convective envelope is so large ( @xmath12k ) that the on cycle is active , reducing the o abundance as observed in the anomalous stars .",
    "@xcite find that the cno abundance is actually somewhat ",
    "although not much  larger in the sg stars .",
    "the latter data indicate that the third dredge - up ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plays a ( small ) role , but the dredge - up episodes must be limited in number .",
    "moreover , a few dredge - up episodes do not alter the s - process abundances , so that the lack of s - process enrichment in the sg is not an argument against the agb polluters .",
    "a confusing issue when discussing the agb evolution of low - metallicity stars is that the chemical yields based on agb modelling by different groups differ enormously .",
    "the yields based on sets of models computed by lattanzio s group , widely used for follow  ups and recently published by @xcite , provide the correct abundance signatures of the sg only for the most massive agbs ( @xmath13 ) , while the yields of ventura s group , and especially the most recent models by @xcite , look compatible with the anomalies down to @xmath14 .",
    "the mass - loss rate formulation , the nuclear reaction rates , and other details such as the treatment of core - overshooting in the phases previous to the agb , are all relevant to the determination of yields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the most important difference among the physical inputs to these two sets is the treatment of superadiabatic convection , which affects the temperature stratification of models in the phase of `` hot bottom burning '' and the stellar luminosity and mass loss @xcite .",
    "a `` more efficient '' convection model like the fst model @xcite adopted in ventura s computations destroys oxygen more efficiently , shortens the agb lifetime , and reduces the number of thermal pulses and the effect of the third dredge - up for a wider range of initial masses than in @xcite .",
    "thus , the agb yields are very model - dependent , and the models of chemical evolution based on these yields are very model - dependent too , so that negative results can not necessarily be taken as falsification of the agb progenitor scenario .",
    "the first complete model for the chemical anomalies by @xcite shows that self  enrichment by agbs is at variance with most of the observational anomalies , but this result could be easily predicted , as it is based on the @xcite set .",
    "more recently , attention has been mostly devoted to explaining the presence of a population with extreme helium content , although , as we have noted , this population is only the tip of the iceberg of the sg , and it is present only in the most massive clusters . as @xmath1  cen  shows the signatures of a complex chemical history ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a summary of the extensive observational studies of @xmath1  cen  ) , and its formation took place most likely over an extended period ( 24 gyr , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several attempts have been made to understand its very high helium population by means of standard chemical evolution models .",
    "@xcite showed that the evolution of @xmath1  cen  can not be understood in terms of a `` closed box '' model , and that , also after relaxing this hypothesis , the helium - to - metal enrichment @xmath15  of the blue ms stars of this system can not be attained , even with the very high helium yields of the winds of massive stars .",
    "models of @xmath1  cen  taking into account inhomogeneous pollution by sne ia can reduce ( by @xmath240% ) but not eliminate the extra amount of helium needed to explain the presence of the blue main sequence ( bms ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumed that the helium yields come from the massive agbs , and that the imf is indeed peaked at these masses , in order to maximize the effect of the self  enrichment . in this case , they indeed could find a fraction of sg stars with y up to @xmath16 , but this is accompanied by a very large cno enrichment , that is not observationally found .",
    "this result again depends on the models adopted to describe the helium yield : only the @xcite models provided helium abundances as large as y@xmath17 in the agb ejecta , and this value was partially achieved at the `` second dredge - up '' @xcite , and partially by the third dredge - up during the thermal pulse phase .",
    "the third dredge - up of course also alters the total cno abundance in the envelopes .",
    "only recently has it become clear that a very high helium content ( y@xmath20.38 ) can be achieved already after the second dredge  up in the envelopes of the most massive `` super - agb '' stars @xcite .",
    "the sum of the cno abundances can remain close to the initial value during the following agb thermal pulse phase , as the efficiency of third dredge - up is limited , because the helium luminosity during the thermal pulses is weak @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , full models through the super - agb thermal pulse phase are not yet available , but it is clear that , in principle , it is possible to achieve high helium abundances without enhancing the cno .",
    "following this idea , @xcite suggest that the extreme helium - rich stars are formed directly from the ejecta of super - agb stars .",
    "finally , @xcite , even adopting a model that maximizes the possible role of agbs , tried and failed again to model the @xmath1  cen  @xmath15  for 30% of its population , concluding that `` alternative processes are desperately called for . ''",
    "again they do not include the most recent yields for super - agbs in their computations , and use an almost closed box model , assuming that for the formation of the fg a fraction from 0.5 to 1 of the available gas is used .",
    "thus the gas from which the sg is formed comes at most from half of the mass of the pristine gas plus the fg ejecta , or entirely from the fg ejecta . under this hypothesis , for any reasonable shape of the imf , the helium rich agb ejecta can not reach 30% of the total cluster mass , as we will discuss again in sect .",
    "[ subsec : frmwrk ] .",
    "in fact , modelling must be able to predict _ at least a factor ten mass loss from the fg _ , to produce the desired number ratio of sg / fg stars of @xmath18 .      in the exploratory models presented in this work",
    ", we do not consider in detail the peculiarity of the super - agb evolution , although we plan to include it in much more detail in subsequent work dealing explicitly with the chemistry of the ejecta .",
    "however , we discuss briefly here the super - agb phase and its possible evolutionary outcomes , as it has consequences for our interpretation of these preliminary model results too . the minimum mass evolving into a core  collapse supernova is today referred to as @xmath19 , to distinguish it from the limit @xmath20 , representing the minimum mass for carbon ignition , below which stars evolve into c  o white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "stars in the mass range @xmath20@xmath21@xmath19  are called super - agbs , and ignite carbon off - center in semi - degenerate conditions , but are not able to ignite hydrostatic neon burning in the resulting o ",
    "consequently , degeneracy increases in the core , and these stars may undergo thermal pulses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lose mass as `` normal '' ( but quite massive and luminous ) agbs , the difference being the core composition ( o  ne versus c  o ) and core mass ( @xmath22 ) .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ subsec : agb ] , super - agbs may play an important role in the evolution of proto  gcs .",
    "@xcite shows that their helium content in the envelope may reach the values y=0.36  0.38 , reasonably consistent with the highest helium content found in the extreme populations of a few gcs , and @xcite suggest that they are in fact the progenitors of the extreme he populations .",
    "the fate of super - agbs depends on the competition between mass loss and core growth @xcite : if mass loss wins , they evolve into massive o  ne white dwarfs @xcite ;",
    "if the core reaches the chandrasekhar mass , they evolve into electron capture supernovae ( ecsne ) , electrons being captured on the ne nuclei .",
    "thus also stars below @xmath19  may explode as supernovae , but these events are at least a factor ten less energetic than sne ii ( @xmath23erg * ? ? ? * ) and also a factor 10 smaller than sne ia .",
    "in fact , it has been recently proposed that practically all the neutron stars ( nss ) today present in gcs are born from ecsne : due to their lower energy output , it is also probable that the newborn ns receives a proportionally smaller natal kick , allowing it to remain bound to the cluster @xcite .",
    "the presence of super - agbs has an interesting consequence on the cluster evolution : the fate of super - agbs in fact is either to end their life quietly as o  ne wds , or to explode as ecsn ( either directly , or due to accretion induced collapse induced by mass transfer by a binary companion ) . in both cases , until o  ne cores are formed , we _ do not _ have sn ia explosions , that are due to the explosion of c  o wds reaching the chandrasekhar mass by accretion .",
    "these events can take place only _ after _",
    "o wds are formed in the cluster , when masses @xmath24@xmath20  evolve . consequently , _",
    "the epoch during which the super - agbs evolve is probably the quietest period of the cluster s life _ , perturbed at most by ecsne explosions , either in single stars or by accretion induced collapse , and in any case not so energetic to alter either the gas evolution , as we will see in the hydrodynamical simulations , or its chemistry , as the whole core remains locked into the remnant neutron star .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a careful study of @xmath19  as a function of the stellar metallicity .",
    "his value for the typical metallicity of gcs showing multiple stellar populations is @xmath25  for models not including core overshooting . for models with moderate core overshooting this value",
    "is reduced by @xmath26 , thus to 9 @xmath27 .",
    "the value of @xmath20  from the models by @xcite is @xmath28 evolving at @xmath265myr ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "these latter models provide yields consistent with the gc chemical anomalies down to the evolution of 5 @xmath27 , evolving at an age of @xmath29 yr . in this scheme , in summary , the sg may be formed by super - agbs down to m@xmath30 , and by agbs down to @xmath31 . in sect .",
    "[ subsec : expl ] , we choose 40  myr as the minimum age to start sn ia explosions , in order to maximize their possible role .",
    "this limit shifts to @xmath32myr for the @xcite models , allowing a longer time for the formation of the sg .",
    "we now consider whether the post - agb evolution can play a role in the formation of the sg .",
    "in fact , after the loss of the envelope , the remnant hot cores evolve toward the white dwarf stage , reaching very high values of t@xmath5  and thus becoming powerful sources of uv photons , acting as extra energy sources and potentially affecting the behaviour of the agb gas .",
    "a study of the possible dynamical role played by extra energy sources is presented in sect .",
    "[ subsec : sour ] .",
    "post - agb evolution of the massive agb core begins when the envelope mass is reduced below a critical value that does not allow stationary h  burning on the agb , so that the residual envelope contracts ( at the constant luminosity dictated by the core mass itself ) and the star becomes increasingly hotter .",
    "planetary nebula excitation occurs at t@xmath5@xmath3330000k , when uv photons begins to be emitted .",
    "the critical envelope mass is a strong function of the core mass .",
    "in addition , the stellar luminosity is also increasing with the core mass .",

    "since the helium yields from super - agbs and agbs are still uncertain , the amount of pristine matter involved , and its mixing with the fg matter is yet to be fully explored , we believe our results show that this scenario is a very promising step towards the understanding of the origin of the super - he rich population .",
    "one of the key requirements of the standard scenario presented in the previous sections is the large initial mass of the fg population .",
    "this assumption , as we have discussed , is necessary for the formation of a significant sg population from the ejecta of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the next issue to address in order to test the viability of the proposed scenario concerns the possible mechanisms driving the evolution of the ratio of the number of sg to fg stars .",
    "numerous studies of the dynamical evolution of star clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for a cluster with an initial mass of @xmath218 , as adopted in the simulations presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] , the mass loss induced by internal two - body relaxation in one hubble time is negligible .",
    "for example , the dissolution time predicted by @xmath0-body simulations @xcite for a tidally limited cluster with initial mass @xmath219 , moving on a circular orbit at 4 kpc from the galactic center , is about @xmath220 gyr .",
    "hence two - body relaxation can not be the process responsible for the loss a significant fraction of the initial fg population , or for the evolution of the ratio of the number of sg to fg stars .",
    "a more promising mass reduction mechanism for the massive stellar systems considered in this study is the early mass loss associated with sn explosions in the fg population . in response to the loss of sn ejecta , a stellar system can expand beyond its tidal limit @xcite , losing stars from its outer layers .",

    "tidally limited clusters with a salpeter imf , it has been shown that the mass loss resulting from this mechanism is negligible if the clusters are sufficiently centrally concentrated , with concentrations ( as measured by the concentration parameter @xmath188 defined earlier ) similar to those typical ( @xmath221 ; @xcite ) of galactic globular clusters @xcite . however",

    "initial mass segregation has dramatic implications for early cluster evolution .",
    "specifically , in an initially segregated cluster , the mass lost due to sn explosions is preferentially removed from the innermost regions of the cluster , and can lead to rapid and significant overall expansion , mass loss , and possibly dissolution , even for an initially highly concentrated system .",
    "our n - body simulations do not include primordial gas ; the effect of primordial gas expulsion would add to that of sn ejecta in triggering the cluster early expansion ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the following sections we explore the role of this early expansion on the evolution of multiple population clusters and , in particular , its implications for the evolution of the cluster stellar populations relative abundance .",

    "we outline the main elements of the dynamical mass loss scenario , the processes and timescales involved , and the effect on the numbers of stars in the two populations .",
    "the early evolution of the cluster is characterized by the rapid loss of fg stars .",
    "this is a consequence of cluster expansion in response to the dynamical heating from the loss of sn ejecta from the fg population : as the cluster expands beyond its tidal radius , the outer layers , which are predominantly populated by fg stars , are stripped .",
    "sg stars , which are mostly confined to the central regions , remain approximately constant in number during this phase . as a result",
    ", the number ratio of sg to fg stars increases rapidly .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to the number ratio of long - lived sg to fg main - sequence stars with masses in the range @xmath38 as @xmath222 .",
    "the characteristic timescale for this early evolution , expansion and stripping is the cluster dynamical time , @xmath223 , although the precise duration of this phase may range from @xmath224 to @xmath146 dynamical times depending on the degree of initial mass segregation and the amount of impulsive mass loss ; see e.g. fig . 3 in @xcite .",
    "the strength of this early expansion and the extent of the consequent loss of fg stars depend mainly on the degree of initial mass segregation , the amount of impulsive mass loss due sn and the structure of the cluster .",
    "as mentioned above , for clusters initially following a king density profile @xcite with concentrations similar to those currently observed in the galactic globular cluster system initial mass segregation plays a key role in triggering a strong expansion and early mass loss . as shown by @xcite the heating due to a given amount of impulsive loss of sn ejecta",
    "is augmented by the preferential removal of the mass from the central regions .",
    "a second important initial parameter is the ratio of the cluster `` king radius '' , @xmath225that is the limiting radius of the king model used to describe the sytem to the cluster s tidal radius , @xmath226 in the galactic field : if @xmath227 , the cluster will not lose a significant number of stars until it fills its roche lobe . for a cluster initially undefilling their roche lobe",

    "the subsequent `` late '' evolution is driven by two - body relaxation and proceeds on a timescale , @xmath228 , which is significantly longer than the dynamical timescale .",
    "two - body relaxation is responsible for mixing the sg and fg populations and for additional mass loss .    for the massive clusters of principal interest in this paper , the total mass loss due to two - body relaxation is small ; for example , using the mass loss rates derived from n - body simulations by @xcite and the current observational values of mass and galactocentric distance , we estimate that a cluster like @xmath1  cen  should have lost at most about 510 percent of its initial mass in one hubble time by two - body relaxation .",
    "the study of less massive multiple population clusters undergoing a significant relaxation driven mass loss will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "we note , however , that star loss induced by two - body relaxation affects all cluster regions and not just the stars in the outer layers as in the early phases of the cluster evolution .",
    "both sg and fg stars escape as a result of two - body relaxation with the result that the variation of the relative abundance of the two populations is significantly smaller during this late relaxation - driven phase than during the early dynamical cluster expansion .",
    "although relaxation - driven stellar escape has a smaller effect on the relative abundance @xmath222 of the two populations , the evolution of this ratio may be affected by mixing , another process driven by two - body relaxation .",
    "the relevant timescale in this case is the two - body relaxation time of the sg subsystem .",
    "as the low - mass sg stars evolve toward energy equipartition , the sg subsystem tends to expand , populating the outer regions of the cluster and mixing with fg stars .",
    "once the two populations are mixed , even if the cluster is still undergoing a strong mass loss , the escaper population is no longer preferentially composed of fg stars and the number ratio of sg to fg stars stops increasing .",
    "we now present the results of @xmath0-body simulations aimed at quantitatively exploring the scenario outlined above .",
    "we start our simulations with an initially segregated fg cluster of 25k stars .",

    "it is not intended to model any stage of cluster evolution .",
    "the degree of initial segregation is such that the ratio of the initial half - mass radius of the entire system ( @xmath229 ) to the half - mass radius of stars more massive than @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) is @xmath232 .",

    "predict its initial structural properties and , finally , @xmath0-body simulations to explore the subsequent dynamical evolution of the two populations .",

    "we have reviewed all the issues concerning the super - agb and massive agb stars as the source of the polluted gas from which sg stars could form .",
    "the hypothesis that agb stars might provide the gas for the sg formation has recently received some criticism in the literature based on possible inconsistencies between models and the observed chemical abundances in sg stars . however , in our review , we have pointed out that the results of chemical processing during the hot bottom burning phases are highly affected by the uncertainties in the basic input physics of these models , and that there is an ample range of plausible input parameters which can provide yields consistent with observations .",
    "in addition , recent models show that the super - agb evolution can produce the helium content required for the very helium - rich population mentioned above . during the super - agb epoch , between the end of sn ii explosions and the beginning of the sn ia explosions ,",
    "there are no mechanisms preventing the formation of a cooling flow and the formations of the very helium - rich sg population from super - agb winds .",
    "we have carried out a number of hydrodynamical simulations to explore the dynamics of gas from super - agb and agb stellar winds and the process of formation of the sg population in the assumption that the sne ii belonging to the fg population clear the gc of its pristine gas .    1 .",
    "our simulations show that this gas collects in a cooling flow into the innermost regions of the cluster where it forms sg stars .",
    "the cluster emerging from the hydrodynamical simulations is one with a sg strongly concentrated in the inner core of a more extended fg population .",
    "initially the fg stars are the dominant stellar population with a total mass that must be about ten times larger than the total mass of the sg stars .",
    "the initial mass of the fg stars needs to be large enough to provide enough stellar mass return and form a substantial amount of sg stars .",
    "we have explored the dependence of our results on the initial mass of the cluster , the stellar imf and the initial cluster size and concentration .",
    "sg stars are always concentrated in the cluster innermost regions and the structure of the newly formed sg subsystem is largely independent of the cluster size and concentration .",
    "3 .   starting with a initial fg mass ten times smaller than the value adopted in our standard model , leads to a sg total mass also ten times smaller but does not alter the shape of the sg density profile or its concentration . for simulations with a flatter imf",
    "the larger amount of gas supplied by agb winds implies that a smaller star formation efficiency is needed to form the required mass of sg stars .",
    "if the requirement that the current mass of long - lived sg and fg stars are similar is maintained , a large fg initial mass is needed also for a flatter imf . in this case",
    "the number of long - lived fg stars is smaller , and a large value of @xmath43 is still needed to have a current mass of long - lived fg stars consistent with observations .",
    "the effects of sne ia and additional energy sources on the sg formation process have been investigated .",
    "our simulations show that , for a `` normal '' ( e.g. kroupa ) imf of the fg stars , the stellar explosions quickly evacuate most of the gas returned by the agb stars , leading to a substantial drop in the gas content of the gc and to a suspension of the sg star formation . given the uncertainties on the sn ia rate , the interruption of the sf may occur in the time interval @xmath254 myr .",
    "flat imfs produce an increment in the amount of returned gas , leading to an enhancement of the radiative losses and , possibly , to the inability of the sne ia to get rid of the gas . in this case",
    "sg stars continue to form and their chemical abundances should show the signature of the pollution by gas from sn ejecta .",
    "this however does not seem to be confirmed observationally and flat imfs are thus disfavoured .",
    "we have further considered the possible presence of a diffuse energy source due to x - ray binaries and/or planetary nebulae .",
    "we show that for the standard model the cooling flow and the associated sg star formation can be halted by energy sources with a total power larger than @xmath255 erg s@xmath99 .",
    "we have also explored the possibility that the fg sne ii do not vent away all the pristine gas , and that part of it remains gravitationally bound to the cluster and falls back onto it after an initial ousting .",
    "the sg stars forming in the cluster central regions before this pristine gas reaches the cluster core originate from pure ejecta of the super - agb stars which is very helium rich .",
    "these stars may form the very helium - rich population present in the most massive gcs .",
