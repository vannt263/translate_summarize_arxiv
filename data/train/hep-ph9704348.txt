    "one of the most important new elements that quantum chromodynamics brings to the strong interactions is the potential existence of new bound states and resonances beyond the conventional mesons , baryons and nuclei .",
    "these include exotic states such as gluonium ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , hybrids ( @xmath7 ) and dibaryons such as the h ( udsuds ) , etc .",
    "a particularly sensitive measure of qcd binding is nuclear - bound quarkonium , _",
    "i.e. _ , a ( @xmath8 ) or ( @xmath9 ) pair bound to a nucleus . in contrast to the usual strongly interacting few - body systems , the hadrons in the ( @xmath10 ) ( @xmath11 ) meson - nucleon system have no valence quarks in common .",
    "however multiple - gluon exchange ( the qcd van der waals force ) may lead to the formation of bound states @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the characteristic size of the @xmath2 is much smaller than the typical hadronic scale ( @xmath12 ) , a qcd calculation based on a multipole expansion was performed in @xcite , leading to nuclear - bound quarkonium binding energies of order @xmath13 mev .",
    "in addition , attractive interactions may also arise from the @xmath14 interaction @xcite .",
    "long - range exchange interactions may arise in second order perturbation theory if there are significant nonvalence ( @xmath15 ) fock states in the quarkonium wavefunction or intrinsic charm ( @xmath16 ) fock states in the nucleon .",
    "there is thus a possibility of a strong @xmath2-nucleon resonance or bound state .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", there is evidence for the state @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 are @xmath19 or @xmath20 quarks ) , reported by the sphinx collaboration @xcite , and there are proposals for a search for the @xmath21 with the same setup @xcite and at fermilab as well @xcite .",
    "another interesting type of exotic state that could arise in qcd are bound states of baryons and antibaryons ( baryonia ) such as @xmath22 and @xmath23 and pentaquarks , @xmath24 , baryons containing five quarks like @xmath25 or @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "baryonia may have binding energies as small as a few mev as is characteristic of nuclear interactions , but they are unstable and decay into mesons via @xmath27 annihilation with possibly narrow widths .",
    "such states have been subject of intensive search@xcite . in particular ,",
    "experiments have looked for strange baryonium in hadronic collisions , typically in @xmath28 reactions at laboratory energies of @xmath29  gev @xcite , @xmath30  gev @xcite and @xmath31  gev @xcite .",
    "the results concerning the width of these states have been somewhat controversial .",
    "some experimental searches @xcite found @xmath32 mev whereas others @xcite found @xmath33 mev .",
    "the existence of narrow structures has never been established or completely ruled out .",
    "searches for the pentaquarks are in progress at fermilab .",
    "data from the collaboration e-791 are currently being analyzed , and another experiment , the e-781 , is accumulating events with charmed baryons , which may determine the existence of certain pentaquarks @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will show how to look for qcd exotic states in a b - factory .",
    "in particular , we will show how the @xmath34 decay channel can be used to search for the ( @xmath35 ) , ( @xmath36 ) and ( @xmath37 ) bound states .",
    "also the appearance of two - body structures in the momentum distribution of the @xmath38 near @xmath39 gev / c in the @xmath40 decay channel may provide a signature for the @xmath26 pentaquark .",
    "among the numerous decay modes of the @xmath0 mesons , the @xmath42 channels have drawn particular attention .",
    "recent measurements of these decays performed by the cleo collaboration @xcite have found the following inclusive branching fractions : @xmath43 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 . crossing this information with the measured @xcite branching fraction @xmath49 for @xmath50",
    ", one can infer that a significant fraction of the charmonium decays correspond to the three - body decay : @xmath51 this process , ideal for our purposes , is depicted in fig .",
    "1a . in first place ,",
    "the @xmath52 environment is much cleaner than in hadronic collisions , and the four momentum of the @xmath0 is precisely determined .",
    "moreover these decay products are very massive and only a small amount ( @xmath53 mev ) of the initial energy is converted into kinetic energy .",
    "the decay particles move slowly in the @xmath0 rest frame , interact strongly and can thus form bound states just below threshold or resonances just above threshold .    the cleo collaboration has already provided a measurement of the inclusive momentum distributions of the @xmath2 and @xmath54 in @xmath0 decays@xcite .",
    "if the @xmath55 is formed as a bound state , the @xmath56 will be produced with a momentum just above @xmath57 gev / c ( in the @xmath0 rest frame ) .",
    "similarly , if the @xmath58 is bound , the @xmath59 will be produced at a momentum above @xmath60 gev / c . finally ,",
    "if the @xmath61 is formed , the @xmath62 will have momentum slightly larger than @xmath63 gev / c .",
    "if the @xmath64 state is below the @xmath65 mass threshold it may be observed in the @xmath66 decay as a narrow peak in the @xmath67 momentum distribution at @xmath63 gev / c .",
    "another interesting decay channel is shown in fig . 1b , where the proton and the @xmath68 meson may be bound forming the @xmath26 pentaquark .",
    "the conjugate process is shown in fig .",
    "1c . in fig .",
    "1d we illustrate the @xmath69 decay . here",
    "the proton and the @xmath70 meson may be bound forming the @xmath71 pentaquark .",
    "this state , although ckm suppressed , is interesting because it is more strongly bound than @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it thus seems possible , with high enough statistics , to identify two - body structures in these spectra , direct signatures for the formation of exotic qcd bound states .    in fig .",
    "2 we reproduce the @xmath72 spectrum presented in @xcite , in which the feed - down modes @xmath73 and @xmath74 have been subtracted .",
    "this procedure eliminates the @xmath2 s coming from decays of excited charmonium states .",
    "the number of remaining points is not large , but we can nevertheless clearly see a distinct secondary bump in the lower momentum region corresponding to the @xmath75 decay .    a baryonium state such as @xmath55 has the same quantum numbers as an excited kaon .",
    "we can distinguish a nuclear - type @xmath76 bound state by the fact that its mass should be within 10 s of mev of the threshold .",
    "thus @xmath0 decays offer not only the possibility of observing baryonium resonances @xcite , but also bound - state baryonia such as the @xmath76 with mass below the threshold ( @xmath77 gev ) .",
    "the ( @xmath55 ) state recoils against the @xmath2 with momentum ( in the @xmath78 c.m.s . ) slightly beyond the upper limit ( @xmath57 gev / c ) of the phase space for the three body decay @xmath79 .",
    "if there is a narrow peak at @xmath80 gev / c , the mass @xmath81 of the @xmath2 decay partner can be immediately inferred from the simple two body phase space formula : @xmath82 with @xmath83 in the above expression @xmath84 is the b meson mass ( @xmath85 gev ) and @xmath86 gev .",
    "this simple equation can be solved for @xmath81 giving @xmath87 gev , which is exactly equal to the sum of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 masses .",
    "a peak above @xmath57 gev would be an indication of a @xmath90 bound - state formation .",
    "if the binding energy of the @xmath55 system is @xmath91 mev then @xmath92 giving @xmath93 mev / c beyond the upper limit of the allowed kinematical region for @xmath94 .",
    "given that the estimated experimental resolution is of @xmath95 mev @xcite , it seems possible to detect such peak .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath54 spectrum is also presented .",
    "the statistics are still small , and there is no evidence of any structure .",
    "this is in agreement with our phase - space based considerations : because of its larger mass ( @xmath96 gev ) , the @xmath54 decay partners can have masses of at most @xmath97 gev .",
    "this is not enough to produce two baryons and therefore a near - threshold decay is excluded .",
    "quantitative predictions for exclusive decay amplitudes such as @xmath98 or strange baryonium formations @xmath99 $ ] involve all of the complexities and uncertainties of qcd hadronization at the amplitude level and at low relative momentum where the gauge interactions are strongest .",
    "nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) has brought significant progress to this field .",
    "the underlying weak decay @xmath100 provides a guide to the flow of the heavy quarks .",
    "very recently @xcite the @xmath2 momentum distribution in the decay @xmath101 was calculated for the first time and compared to data .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the obtained spectra agree with data , but fail in the low momentum region , exactly where we may expect some enhancement due to the exclusive channel considered here .",
    "in general , hadronization will distort the `` bare '' quark momentum distribution given by the weak matrix element .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the momentum distribution of the initial quarks inside the @xmath0 meson , which was shown in @xcite to strongly affect the spectrum of final particles . in order to keep our approach simple",
    ", we shall assume that the @xmath2 spectrum measured over the whole available phase space gives a good indication of how the complicated underlying dynamics modifies the pure phase space picture ( @xmath102 const ) , thus providing a good representation of the squared matrix element .    in what follows we describe our modified phase space analysis of @xmath0 decay .",
    "following the standard description of the kinematics@xcite the decay rate , at the hadronic level , is given by : @xmath103 in the above expression the indexes 1,2 and 3 refer to the @xmath2 , @xmath88 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "@xmath104 is the energy of the @xmath105 particle and @xmath106 is the center of mass energy .",
    "we take @xmath107 as @xmath108 where the function f is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the maximum momentum allowed for the @xmath2 . in our case @xmath114",
    "gev and the function f reproduces the data presented in @xcite .",
    "the normalization of @xmath115 is absorbed in the constant in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matf ] ) .    in the rest frame of the decaying particle ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) the integration over the variables 2 and 3",
    "can be then easily done and we obtain the @xmath2 momentum spectrum : @xmath118 where we have omitted all constant factors ( since the normalization is free ) and @xmath119 inserting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spec ] ) the values of the masses , we obtain a spectrum which is adjusted to data and plotted in fig .",
    "2 as a solid line . as can be seen , the position of the maximum given by the simple modified phase space model coincides with the maximum of the bump . in fig .",
    "2 we also show ( with a dotted line ) the fit of data with eq.([eq : f ] ) . in the region",

    "i.e. _ , all processes other than eq .",
    "( [ eq : bran ] ) in which a @xmath2 is produced . subtracting the integral of the dotted curve ( over @xmath121   gev / c ) from the integral of the solid line we can obtain an estimate for the branching fraction for eq .",

    "we assume that the width of this state is equal to its binding energy .",
    "a final condition must be satisfied by this bound state : it will be observed only if the strength of the peak is much larger than the background . for illustration",
    "we have estimated this strength to be @xmath125 of the whole distribution .",

    "more details are given in the next section .",
    "in this section we explain how to estimate the strength of the quasi - two - body decays corresponding to the area below the ( dashed line ) peak in the @xmath2 momentum distribution .",
    "the process @xmath126 can be understood , at the quark level , as the reaction @xmath127 characterized by a cross section , @xmath128 , which can not be rigorously calculated .",
    "since we are always treating the case where we have a @xmath2 , we can coalesce the two charmed quarks into one particle and say that the effective reaction is @xmath129 where the six quarks system has invariant mass @xmath130 . following the spirit of the approximations made in the last section ,",
    "the differential cross section @xmath128 can be written as @xmath131 where the constant factor represents the matrix element squared and @xmath132 is the phase space factor for the seven final particles ( @xmath133 ) , which , with the help of a recursion relation @xcite , can be written as a function of @xmath130 : @xmath134 in the center of mass system , from energy momentum conservation we have @xmath135 solving this relation for @xmath136 , differentiating with respect to @xmath130 , substituting in eq .",

    "( [ eq : r7 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigr7 ] ) we obtain @xmath137 where a nonrelativistic approximation is made and some immaterial constants are dropped .",
    "with the additional assumption that the six body phase space is approximately one - dimensional and taking constituent masses for the quarks ( @xmath138 mev ) we can evaluate @xmath139 ( almost ) analytically . as expected the curve eq .",
