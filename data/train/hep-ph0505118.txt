    "the large @xmath2 qcd approach suggested by t hooft @xcite and considered in detail by witten @xcite has become a powerful tool in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the method is based on the result that , for @xmath5 flavors , the ground state baryons display an exact su(@xmath6 ) spin - flavor symmetry in the large @xmath2 limit of qcd @xcite .",
    "it has been applied with great success to the ground state baryons ( @xmath7 band ) , described by the symmetric representation @xmath8 of su(6 ) , where @xmath5 = 3 @xcite . for excited baryons",
    "this symmetry is broken .",
    "however , based on the observation that excited states can be approximately classified as su(@xmath6 ) multiplets , considerable efforts have previously been made to analyze the excited states belonging to the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet ( @xmath10 band ) in the large @xmath2 limit @xcite , with obvious success .",
    "the @xmath11 band contains the multiplets @xmath12 , [ { \\bf 56},2^+ ] , [ { \\bf 70},0^+ ] , [ { \\bf 70},2^+]$ ] and @xmath13 $ ] . among them ,",
    "the baryons supposed to belong to @xmath14 $ ] or @xmath12 $ ] have been considered so far in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite has recently been extended to higher excitations belonging to the @xmath15 $ ] multiplet ( @xmath16 band ) @xcite . for simplicity , in these studies",
    "configuration mixing has been neglected .",
    "the symmetric representation @xmath17 requires a much simpler treatment than the mixed representation @xmath18 .",
    "the main reason is that for the symmetric representation it is not necessary to distinguish between excited and core quarks .",
    "this is possible because of the structure of the wave function .",
    "let us consider the case @xmath14 $ ] . for large @xmath2",
    "this multiplet becomes @xmath19,2^+]$ ] .",
    "of the irrep @xmath20 $ ] of su(6 ) .",
    "the dimension of the symmetric representation of su(@xmath6 ) containing @xmath2 particles and labelled by the partition @xmath21 $ ] is @xmath22 } = \\frac{(2 n_f + n_c - 1)!}{n_c!~(2n_f - 1)!}$ ] . with @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "one recovers * 56*. ] its intrinsic wave function ( center of mass coordinate removed ) , written in a harmonic oscillator single particle basis , takes the form @xmath25(0s)^{n_c-1}(0d)\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_c-1}}|[n_c](0s)^{n_c-2}(0p)^2\\rangle,\\ ] ] which shows that for @xmath26 one can neglect the second term .",
    "this cumbersome term , involves an excited core after the removal of the last particle , while in the first term the entire excitation is carried by one quark , excited to the @xmath27 shell .",
    "the remaining symmetric core of @xmath28 unexcited quarks is simpler than an excited core .",
    "now , if we consider the spin - orbit 1-body interaction @xmath29 it is easy to show that @xmath30 as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite and , in a different manner , in the appendix below . in this equation @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "are the total and the spin - flavor wave functions of the excited baryon respectively .",
    "( note that @xmath32 and the spatial wave function of the appendix have the same permutation symmetry , thus the same partition . ) with this result , the spin - orbit operator takes the simple form used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the situation with the multiplets @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] is different .",
    "this can be illustrated by writing the orbital part of the intrinsic wave functions following the same prescription as above . for @xmath33",
    "one obtains @xmath34_{\\rho,\\lambda}(0s)^{n_c-1}(1s)\\rangle   + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}|[n_c-1,1]_{\\rho,\\lambda}(0s)^{n_c-2}(0p)^2\\rangle.\\ ] ] in the first term @xmath35 is the first single particle radially excited state with @xmath36 , @xmath33 ( @xmath37 ) . in the second term",
    "the two quarks are excited to the @xmath38-shell to get @xmath39 .",
    "they are coupled to @xmath33 .",
    "the lower indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constituent quark model notations .",
    "they distinguish between states which are antisymmetric and symmetric under permutation of the first two particles , respectively .",
    "by analogy , for @xmath27 one has @xmath42_{\\rho,\\lambda}(0s)^{n_c-1}(0d)\\rangle   + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}|[n_c-1,1]_{\\rho,\\lambda}(0s)^{n_c-2}(0p)^2\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the two quarks in the @xmath38-shell are coupled to @xmath27 .",
    "we have obtained the expressions ( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) by using the procedure developed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on generalized jacobi coordinates for single particle states everywhere in the text . ] .",
    "the @xmath2 = 3 case is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can see that the coefficients of the linear combinations ( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) are independent of @xmath2 which means that both terms have to be considered in the large @xmath2 limit . in eqs .",
    "( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) the first term can be treated as in the @xmath9 $ ] sector , _",
    "i.e. _ as an excited quark coupled to a ground state core @xcite",
    ". the second term will be treated here as an excited quark coupled to an excited core .    to our knowledge",
    "this is the first attempt to incorporate core excitations in the system and treat the mass operator accordingly .",
    "as there are similarities with the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet , we view this study as an extension of refs .",
    "@xcite . in practice",
    "we shall combine the techniques of refs . @xcite and @xcite .    before ending this section",
    "we should recall that in reality the excited states are resonances , so they have a finite width .",
    "this is not taken into account in the present approach , similarly to constituent quark models where resonances are treated as bound states . however , it is important to notice , that the bound state picture turned out to describe the baryon phenomenology satisfactorily , thus being a rather realistic picture of baryon resonnances @xcite .",
    "the decay widths have been considered , for example , in refs . @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that a general large @xmath2 analysis does not predict narrow widths , which would vanish in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "contrary , generic large @xmath2 counting gives widths of order @xmath43 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the narrowness of the excited states is an artifact of simple quarks model assumptions used in the calculations , as it is the case here .",
    "we shall separately discuss the two distinct configurations entering the wave functions ( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) .      in eqs .",
    "( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) the first term , containing the configurations @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , is similar in structure with the wave functions of the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet ( @xmath24 ) , the difference being that the quark is now excited to the @xmath46 band ( @xmath33 or @xmath27 ) instead of @xmath47 .",
    "the configurations @xmath44 and @xmath45 are then described by a wave function written in the notation of ref . @xcite as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the total spin and isospin of the baryon , @xmath51 is the angular momentum of the excited quark , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the core spin and isospin respectively , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath56 will be presented below .",
    "the coupling coefficients are su(2 ) coefficients , as we consider here only non - strange baryons ( @xmath57 ) .      in order to better understand the @xmath3 counting",
    "it is useful to rewrite the orbital part of the wave function using the fractional parentage technique @xcite by which the last particle is decoupled .",
    "here we consider the only case treated in the literature , where the mixed symmetric state belonging to the representation @xmath59 $ ] has the last particle in the second row of the corresponding young diagram .",
    "then , the second term of ( [ l0 ] ) or ( [ l2 ] ) takes the form @xmath60}\\left((0s)^{n_c-2}~(0p)\\right ) \\phi_{[1]}(0p ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n_c } } \\psi_{[n_c-1]}\\left((0s)^{n_c-3}~(0p)^2\\right)\\phi_{[1]}(0s)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the decoupling being valid both for @xmath33 and 2 . here",
    "all states are normalized .",
    "the first factor in each term in the right - hand side is a symmetric @xmath61-particle wave function and @xmath62}$ ] is a one particle wave function associated to the @xmath2-th particle .",
    "one can see that for large @xmath2 the coefficient of the first term is @xmath63 and of the second @xmath64 .",
    "then , in the large @xmath2 limit , one can neglect the second term and take into account only the first term in the wave function , where the @xmath2-th particle has an @xmath65 excitation .",
    "a similar decomposition can be made for a symmetric state @xmath66 $ ] or a mixed symmetric state @xmath59 $ ] containing one excited quark only ( see appendix ) . in that case",
    "one can immediately recover the considerations developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the spin - orbit or other operators .",
    "for the @xmath74 $ ] sector the building blocks which form the operators entering in the mass formula consist of the excited core operators @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the excited quark operators @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ". we also introduce the tensor operator @xmath83 with @xmath84 , @xmath85 or vice versa or @xmath86 or @xmath87 . for simplicity",
    "when @xmath88 , we shall use a single index @xmath89 , for the core , and @xmath90 for the excited quark so that the operators are @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "the latter case represents the tensor operator used in the analysis of the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) .       in table [ multiplet ] we present the masses of the resonances which we have interpreted as belonging to the @xmath0 $ ] or to the @xmath1 $ ] multiplet . for simplicity , mixing of multiplets is neglected in this first attempt .",
    "the resonances shown in column 8 , correspond to either three stars (  very likely \" ) or to two stars (  fair \" ) or to one star (  poor \" ) status , according to particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "therefore we used the full listings to determine a mass average in each case .",
    "the experimental error to the mass was calculated as the quadrature of two uncorrelated errors , one being the average error from the same references and the other was the difference between the average mass and the farthest observed mass . for the @xmath94 * resonance we report results from fitting the experimental value of ref .",
    "@xcite , as being more recent than the average over the pdg values .",
    "note that the observed mass of ref .",
    "@xcite is in agreement with the recent coupled channel analysis of manley and saleski @xcite .",
    "several remarks are in order . due to its large error in the mass , the resonance @xmath95(2000 )",
    "could be either described by the @xmath965/2^+\\rangle$ ] state or by the @xmath975/2^+\\rangle$ ] state ( inasmuch as they appear separated by about 60 - 70 mev only , in quark model studies , see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "here we identified @xmath95(2000 ) with the @xmath975/2^+\\rangle$ ] state because it gives a better fit .",
    "regarding the @xmath98(1905 ) resonance there is also some ambiguity . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was identified as a @xmath995/2^+\\rangle$ ] state following ref .",
    "@xcite , but in ref .",
    "@xcite the interpretation @xmath1005/2^+\\rangle$ ] was preferred due to a better @xmath101 fit and other considerations related to the decay width . here",
    "we return to the identification made in ref .",
    "@xcite and assign the @xmath1005/2^+\\rangle$ ] state to the second resonance from this sector , namely @xmath98(2000 ) , as indicated in table [ multiplet ] .",
    "we hope that an analysis based on configuration mixing and improved data could better clarify the resonance assignment in this sector in the future .",
    "presently the resulting @xmath102 is about 0.83 and the fitted values of @xmath103 are given in table [ operators ] . besides the seven fitted masses table [ multiplet ] also contains few predictions .",
    "we found that the contributions of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are nearly equal when treated as independent operators .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we assumed that they have the same coefficient in the mass operator .",
    "one can see that the spin - spin interaction given by @xmath106 is the dominant interaction , as in the @xmath14 $ ] multiplet @xcite or in the @xmath15 $ ] multiplet @xcite .",
    "thus the main contributions to the mass come from @xmath107 and @xmath106 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath108 and @xmath109 of the multiplets @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] , both located in the @xmath11 band , are very close to each other . in terms of the present notation the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath14 $ ] is @xmath110 mev and @xmath111 mev as compared to @xmath112 mev and @xmath113 mev here .",

    "extrapolation to higher energies , @xmath117 , suggests that the contribution of the spin dependent operators would vanish , while the linear term in @xmath2 , which in a quark model picture would contain the free mass term , the kinetic and the confinement energy , would carry the entire excitation .",
    "such a behaviour gives a deeper insight into the large @xmath2 mass operator and is consistent with the intuitive picture developed in ref .",
    "@xcite where at high energies the spin dependent interactions vanish as a consequence of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "finally note that the contributions of @xmath118 and @xmath119 lead to large errors in the coefficients @xmath103 obtained in the @xmath101 fit , which could possibly be removed with better data .",
    "the operator @xmath119 containing the tensor term plays an important role in the reduction of @xmath102 and it should be further investigated .    in conclusion we believe that the mass fit of the @xmath74 $ ] baryons is encouraging in the present form .",
    "it is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies that the dominant interaction is of a spin - spin nature .",
    "it would be interesting to extend this analysis such as to incorporate configuration mixing with the @xmath14 $ ] states . in this way",
