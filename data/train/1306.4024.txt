    "white dwarf ( wd ) stars are stellar remnants composed almost entirely of the inert byproducts of previous nuclear reactions ; they are the burnt - out cores of stars with initial masses below about @xmath7 @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the majority of wds have an overall mass near @xmath80.6 @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "wds near this canonical mass are expected to harbor remnant carbon - oxygen ( co ) cores after core hydrogen burning and subsequent helium burning .",
    "however , an isolated progenitor star with an initial mass larger than about @xmath9 @xmath4  will reach sufficiently high temperature to achieve stable carbon burning , and may possibly end up as an ultramassive wd with an oxygen - neon ( one ) or oxygen - neon - magnesium ( onemg ) core , if the progenitor had insufficient conditions to start further nuclear burning and detonate as a type ii supernova @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a 9 @xmath4  progenitor model undergoes repeated carbon - burning shell flashes when its core exceeds @xmath81.05 @xmath4 , ultimately ending up as a wd with an one core , although rotation may also play a role in the outcome of an intermediate - mass progenitor @xcite .",
    "we note that there are other possible formation channels for ultramassive wds , most importantly binary evolution , specifically the merger of double - degenerate systems @xcite .",
    "a handful of ultramassive wds ( @xmath10 @xmath4 ) have been found in nature . @xcite",
    "have reviewed the evidence for ultramassive wds and find much of it compelling .",
    "however , since we can not see below the photosphere of these wds , our understanding of their interiors is essentially superficial .    direct evidence that ultramassive wds harbor one cores comes from heavy isotope anomalies found in classical novae , which match predicted abundances from explosive nucleosynthesis on massive wds with onemg cores @xcite .",
    "additionally , two oxygen - rich wds were recently discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "these wds are likely exposed one cores , as the observed o / c abundance ratio indicates a very low overall carbon mass fraction , a prediction for some of the most massive progenitors avoiding core collapse @xcite .",
    "a more direct test of ultramassive wd core composition would be to find a massive wd undergoing pulsations .",
    "asteroseismology offers the unique opportunity to use these pulsations to probe below the photosphere and into the interior of stars , and has had numerous successful applications with wds ( see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "we have thus engaged in a search for pulsations in massive wds in or near the dav ( or zz ceti ) instability strip , a region for which wds with hydrogen - dominated atmospheres have the appropriate temperature to develop a hydrogen partial ionization zone , which in turn drives global pulsations . that search has already yielded multiple new massive davs @xcite after the 1.1  @xmath4  bpm  37093 discovered by @xcite .    here",
    "we report a new success in that search : the discovery of the most massive pulsating wd known , gd  518 .",
    "model fits to the optical spectrum first reported by @xcite show this is a @xmath11  @xmath12 k wd with @xmath1  @xmath2 , which would correspond to a mass of @xmath3 @xmath4  using the one wd models of @xcite or a mass of @xmath13 @xmath4  using the co wd models of @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we present our discovery of pulsations in gd  518 . in sections  [ sec : observations ] and",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we outline our observations and analysis .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the impact of this finding in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we targeted gd  518 ( wd  j165915.11 + 661033.3 ) as a candidate ultramassive pulsating wd based on model atmosphere fits to its optical spectrum . the object was first classified in @xcite .",
    "evolutionary models by @xcite suggest that such a wd has a cooling age of roughly 1.7 gyr and an absolute @xmath14-band magnitude of 13.6 mag , which indicates that gd  518 ( @xmath6=17.2 mag ) is roughly 53 pc from earth .",
    "we display the optical spectrum analyzed by @xcite in figure  [ fig : gd518spec ] .",
    "the spectrum was obtained in 2009  march using the 2.3 m telescope at steward observatory , equipped with the boller & chivens spectrograph at a resolution of @xmath86    full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , covering a wavelength range from roughly @xmath15  .",
    "a more detailed explanation of the observations , models , and fitting can be found in sections  @xmath16 of @xcite .",
    "we obtained additional spectroscopy from the flwo 1.5 m telescope in 2013  april using the fast spectrograph @xcite .",
    "these observations , four 20 minute exposures at a resolution of 1.7    fwhm , cover a wavelength range from @xmath17  .",
    "using the same models and fitting method as in @xcite , we confirm that this wd has a very high surface gravity . although this new summed spectrum is much lower signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n@xmath815 ) , our fits formally yield @xmath11  @xmath18 k and @xmath1  @xmath19 , which agree with the previous determination within the stated uncertainties .",
    "we thus adopt the primary parameters derived from the higher quality ( s / n@xmath855 ) spectrum analyzed in @xcite , displayed in figure  [ fig : gd518spec ] .",
    "a @xmath20 k temperature puts gd  518 inside an extrapolated empirical instability strip for davs of high mass @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite noted that gd  518 was a `` most intriguing '' candidate to target for possible pulsations .",
    "we obtained time - series photometric observations of gd  518 at the mcdonald observatory over nine nights in 2013  march , eight of them consecutive , and five nights in 2013  april , for a total of more than 42.9 hr of coverage over 33 nights .",
    "a full journal of observations can be found in table  [ tab : jour ] .",
    "we used the argos instrument , a frame - transfer ccd mounted at the prime focus of the 2.1 m otto struve telescope @xcite , to obtain @xmath21 s exposures on this @xmath22 mag wd .",

    "the optical light curve of gd  518 shows low - amplitude but statistically significant variability at multiple periods , ranging from roughly @xmath5 s , with amplitudes that can reach up to 0.7% over a single night of observations .",
    "this can be seen by eye in the top panel of figure  [ fig : gd518lc ] , as well as in the ft of our entire data set in the bottom panel of that same figure .",
    "we have attempted to identify the periodicities present in the star , which will form the basis for future asteroseismic modeling . complicating our analysis , however , is the fact that the amplitudes ( and perhaps frequencies ) of the observed variability are not consistent from night - to - night .",

    "we have included the period ( @xmath32 ) and amplitude ( @xmath33 ) of the highest peaks for each night in table  [ tab : jour ] .",
    "there is thus some strong frequency and/or amplitude modulation occurring in gd  518 acting on the timescale of days , perhaps caused by beating of closely spaced periodicities or perhaps due to a physical mechanism in the star .",
    "we have therefore broken up the data into different subsets of minimum length allowed by the frequency splitting in the overall frequency solution : the first five nights ( 2013 mar @xmath34 ) , the second five nights ( 2013 mar @xmath35 ) , and the final nine nights ( 2013 apr @xmath36 ) .",
    "we present a frequency solution for each subset in table  [ tab : gd518freq ] .",
    "it was determined by computing an ft , then a nonlinear least - squares fit on the frequency with the highest amplitude , then prewhitening by that frequency until there are no peaks above a 4@xmath29 significance line , which came from the average amplitude of an ft from 0 to @xmath30 @xmath31hz  of the unprewhitened data .",
    "we have included the 508 s periodicity in the solution for our first subset even though it is not above 4@xmath29 , based on its presence in other subsets .",
    "for more realistic estimates , the quoted uncertainties in table  [ tab : gd518freq ] are not formal least - squares uncertainties to the data but rather the product of 1000 monte carlo simulations of perturbed data using the software package period04 @xcite .",

    "additionally , the star is in the footprint of the sdss , and matching @xmath64 colors with synthetic models suggests this is an ultramassive wd @xcite . obtaining a parallax distance to gd  518 will help settle its mass .",
    "there is theoretical support to expect that it will be possible to distinguish the core composition of a massive wd .",
    "@xcite explored the adiabatic pulsational properties of massive wds and found several noticeable differences between co - core models and one - core models of a @xmath65 @xmath4  wd , the only mass they calculated .",
    "their one - core models were characterized by strong deviations in their forward period spacing , and the mean period spacing for their one models was noticeably larger than the mean period spacing for their co - core modes . additionally , the pulsation modes in their one - core models had consistently lower kinetic energies than those in the co - core models .    however , the reason they found lower kinetic energies ( and larger period spacings ) for pulsations in their one - core models is that those one - core models were significantly more crystallized ( @xmath66% by mass ) at the same temperature , @xmath67 k , than their co - core models ( @xmath850% by mass ) .",
    "crystallization occurs when the coulomb energy between neighboring ions becomes more than two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal energy of the ions in the wd core , and is a naturally occurring stage of wds as they cool @xcite .",
    "a 1.2 @xmath4  wd should be significantly more crystallized at a similar temperature than a 1.05 @xmath4  wd .",
    "we expect that pulsation energy would be largely excluded from the interior crystallized mass .    with less of the stellar material participating in the global pulsations",
    ", it is conceivable that the oscillations have less mode inertia , and can vary on shorter timescales relative to the pulsation periods .",
    "indeed , we observe large amplitude changes in this massive wd ( see figure  [ fig : halves ] ) , which may be a consequence of its large crystallized mass fraction .",
    "this relatively short - term amplitude modulation , especially in which pulsation amplitudes fall below detectability , has been seen before in other massive pulsating wds , notably bpm  37093 and sdss j005047.60 - 002316.9 @xcite .",
    "as the highest - mass pulsating wd ever discovered , gd  518 will provide rich insight into the physics of crystallization , as initiated by studies of bpm  37093 @xcite .",
    "however , the degeneracy in parameters caused by crystallization will pose a significant challenge to finding a robust asteroseismic differentiation of the core composition of gd  518 . we expect to need a significant number of observed independent pulsation modes in order to overcome the many free parameters in our asteroseismic fits .",
    "still , we are encouraged by the number of independent periods we have already determined ( at least three ) with a relatively short , single - site campaign .    it is possible that the three highest - amplitude periods we observe  at @xmath68  s , @xmath69  s , and @xmath70  s  are of the same spherical degree ( @xmath71 ) , since they are spaced by roughly 73.0 s and 70.5 s , respectively .",
    "they are unlikely consecutive radial orders .",
    "the 90% crystallized 1.15 @xmath4  co - core models of @xcite find mean period spacings for @xmath72 modes of @xmath73 s , depending on the hydrogen layer mass . likewise , @xcite expect period spacings of roughly 20 s for @xmath72 modes of a 1.05 @xmath4  one - core model .",
    "period spacings for @xmath74 modes should be @xmath75 times longer .    aside from the imprint the core chemical profile makes on the pulsation spectrum",
    ", the core composition also affects the rate of cooling for a wd .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the cooling time of a wd is inversely proportional to the mean atomic weight of the ions in the core . in some cases we can directly measure this cooling rate by monitoring , long - term , the rate of period change of stable pulsation modes in a dav ( e.g. , @xcite ) . measuring",
    "the rate of period change of any coherent modes will allow another direct test of core composition for this ultramassive wd , albeit a longer - term endeavor .",
    "successfully unraveling both the overall mass and the core composition of gd  518 will constrain intermediate - mass stellar evolution .",
    "it also provides an opportunity to put an upper limit on the primary in a type ia supernovae progenitor system , which theory predicts is a co - core wd , since an onemg - core wd is expected to collapse due to electron capture before detonation as a type ia supernova @xcite .",
