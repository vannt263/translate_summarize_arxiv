    "flat rotation curves around galaxies constitute one of the most stunning astrophysical findings since 1930s .",
    "the cases can simply be attributed to the unobservable dark matter which still lacks a satisfactory candidate . on the general relativity side which reigns in the large universe",
    "an interesting approach is to develop appropriate models of constant centrifugal force .",
    "one such attempt was formulated by grumiller @xcite in which the centrifugal force was given by @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 represents the mass ( both normal and dark ) while the parameter `` @xmath4 '' is a positive constant - called rindler acceleration @xcite - which gives rise to a constant attractive force .",
    "the newtonian potential involved herein is @xmath5 , so that for @xmath6 the term @xmath7 becomes dominant . since in newtonian circular motion @xmath8 , for a mass @xmath9 tangential speed @xmath10 and radius @xmath11",
    "are related by @xmath12 for large @xmath11 , overall which amounts slightly nearer to the concept of flat rotation curves .",
    "no doubts , the details and exact flat rotation curves must be much more complicated than the toy model depicted here .",
    "physically the parameter `` @xmath4 '' becomes meaningful when one refers to an accelerated frame in a flat space , known as rindler frame and accordingly the terminology rindler acceleration is adopted .",
    "in @xcite impact of a rindler - type acceleration is studied on the oort cloud and in @xcite the solar system constraints on rindler acceleration is investigated while in @xcite bending of light in the model of gravity at large distances proposed by grumiller @xcite is considered .",
    "let us add also that to tackle the flat rotation curves , modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) in space was proposed @xcite .",
    "assuming a physical source to the rindler acceleration term in the spacetime metric has been challenging in recent years .",
    "anisotropic fluid field was considered originally by grumiller @xcite , whereas nonlinear electromagnetism was proposed as an alternative source @xcite .",
    "a fluid model with energy - momentum tensor of the form @xmath13 $ ] was proposed recently in the popular @xmath0 gravity @xcite . for a review of the latter we propose @xcite . by a similar strategy",
    "we wish to employ the vast richness of @xmath14 gravity models to identity possible candidates that may admit rindler type acceleration .",
    "our approach in this study beside the rindler acceleration is to elaborate on the energy conditions in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "although violation of the energy conditions is not necessarily a problem ( for instance , any quantum field theory violates all energy conditions ) but it is still interesting to investigate the non - violation of the energy conditions . note that energy conditions within the context of dark matter in @xmath14 gravity was considered by various authors @xcite .",
    "this at least will filter the viable models that satisfy the energy conditions . in brief , for our choice of energy - momentum the weak energy conditions ( wecs ) can be stated as follow : i ) wec1 says that energy density @xmath15 .",
    "ii ) wec2 , says that @xmath16 , and iii ) wec3 states that @xmath17 . the more stringent energy conditions , the strong energy conditions ( secs ) amounts further to @xmath18 , which will not be our concern in this paper .",
    "however , some of our models satisfy secs as well . our technical method can be summarized as follows . upon obtaining @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 as functions of @xmath11",
    "we shall search numerically for the geometrical regions in which the wecs are satisfied .",
    "( a detailed work on energy condition in @xmath14 gravity was done by j. santos et al in @xcite ) .    from the outset",
    "our strategy is to assume validity of the rindler modified schwarzschild metric a priori and search for the types of @xmath14 models which are capable to yield such a metric .",
    "overall we test ten different models of @xmath0 gravity models and observe that in most cases it is possible to tune free parameters in rendering the wecs satisfied . in doing this",
    "we entirely rely on numerical plots and we admit that our list is not an exhaustive one in @xmath0 arena",
    ".    organization of the paper goes as follows .",
    "ii introduces the formalism with derivation of density and pressure components . sec .",
    "iii presents eleven types of @xmath0 models relevant to the mannheim s metric .",
    "the paper ends with conclusion in sec .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 to have an idea of the range in which wecs are satisfied we also plot the metric function which identifies the location of the horizon .",
    "it is observed from the figure that wecs are all satisfied for @xmath27 in which @xmath28 is the event horizon of the grumiller s metric . since @xmath29 the plot of @xmath14",
    "is from @xmath30 up to zero and as can be seen @xmath31 while @xmath32 .",

    "@xmath99 may be considered as a cosmological constant . having this @xmath0",
    "one finds @xmath100@xmath101which are positive functions with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "this means that this model of @xmath14 gravity is satisfying the necessary conditions to be physical .",
    "yet we have to check the wecs at least to see whether it can be a good candidate for a spacetime with rindler acceleration , namely the mannheim s metric .",
    "figure 1 displays @xmath79 @xmath22 and @xmath23 together with part of @xmath102 in terms of @xmath103 we see that the wecs are satisfied right after the horizon .",

    "hence we go one step more to check the heat capacity of the spacetime to investigate if the solution is stable from the thermodynamical point of view . to do so , first we find the hawking temperature @xmath106then , from the general form of the entropy in @xmath14 gravity we find@xmath107 in which @xmath108 is the surface area of the black hole at the horizon and @xmath109 .",
