    "population studies indicate that there are at least three different groups of galactic gamma - ray sources ( gehrels et al .",
    "2000 ; grenier 2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "one is a group of bright sources distributed along the galactic plane , with a concentration toward the inner spiral arms .",
    "these sources are well - correlated with young stellar objects and star - forming regions ( romero et al .",
    "1999 , romero 2001 ) .",
    "we will call these sources gamma - ray population i ( grp i ) .",
    "there is another group of sources distributed around the galactic center , forming a halo with a radius of @xmath0 .",
    "these sources are softer and more variable than grp i sources",
    ". we will call this group gamma - ray population ii ( grp ii ) .",
    "finally , there is a group of sources correlated with the gould belt ( grenier 1995 , 2000 ) .",
    "these are nearby , relatively young and weak sources .",
    "we will name them the local gamma - ray population ( lgrp ) .",
    "recent variability studies ( nolan et al . 2003 ; torres et al . 2001a , b ) show that grp ii sources are very variable .",
    "there is also a subgroup of variable sources among those in the grp i. this variability , with timescales from weeks to months , indicates that the counterparts are compact or small objects .",
    "supernova remnants , ob star forming regions , and other extended sources are ruled out .",
    "isolated pulsars , which are known to be steady sources , are also discarded .",
    "recently , kaufman bernad et al . (",
    "2002 ) have suggested that the parent population of grp i sources are microquasars with high - mass stellar companions and jets that form a small angle with the line of sight , i.e. the  microblazar \" population suggested by mirabel & rodriguez ( 1999 ) . in the kaufman bernad et al .",
    "( 2002 ) model , the gamma ray emission is produced by inverse compton ( ic ) up - scattering of uv photons from the companion stars , as suggested by paredes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the microquasar ls 5039 ( see also bosch - ramon & paredes 2004 ) .",
    "more recent models ( romero et al . 2003 ) incorporate the effect of hadrons in the interaction of the jet with the wind of the star . in the present paper",
    ", we extend the kaufman bernad et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposal to encompass both grp i and grp ii variable sources .",
    "we suggest that old low - mass microquasars , either ejected from the galactic plane or from globular clusters , might be the counterparts of the grp ii . for grp i sources , we suggest that a subgroup of them ( the most variable ones ) might be high - mass microquasars .",
    "some of them might have soft tev counterparts . in the next sections we present some models for these objects .",
    "grp i sources in the third egret catalog ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) have an average photon index @xmath1 .",
    "their @xmath2 plot is a steep power law typical of young objects concentrated in the inner spiral arms .",
    "the expected ( isotropic ) luminosity range for these sources goes from @xmath3 to @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "there are 17 variable sources in this group .",
    "grp ii sources are softer ( @xmath6 ) and significantly more variable .",
    "actually , they are even more variable than the isotropic population of extragalactic sources ( nolan et al . 2003 ) .",
    "there are @xmath7 sources in this group .",
    "they have a distribution consistent with a spherical halo around the galactic center with a density profile that is nearly flat up to a radius @xmath8 kpc and then falls as @xmath9 .",
    "their inferred 1-sr luminosities are in the range @xmath10 erg s@xmath5 . the distribution of these sources is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "grp i sources are young , with ages of a few myr . on the contrary ,",
    "grp ii should have ages from hundreds of myr to gyr .",
    "it is usually said that microquasars , i.e. x - ray binaries with relativistic jets , are scaled - down versions of extragalactic quasars .",
    "in fact , there are many similarities , especially regarding the nature of the accretion disk / jet coupling . however , with respect to the high - energy emission , not the similarities but the differences between these two types of objects are most interesting .",
    "the main difference is of course the presence of a star companion in the case of microquasars .",
    "this star provides a gravitational field that can exert a torque on the accretion disk of the compact object that can result in the precession of the jets , and hence in the periodic variability of the non - thermal emission ( kaufman bernad et al . 2002 ) .",
    "in addition to the gravitational field , a massive star has a strong photon field ( peaked in uv in the case of an early o star ) and a matter field in the form of a strong particle wind .",
    "the relativistic jets ejected from the surroundings of the compact object must traverse these fields , so interactions are unavoidable .",
    "ic up - scattering of uv stellar photons produce a high - energy emission that depends on the particle energy distribution , geometry of the jet , orbital parameters , and the spectral type of the companion star ( kaufman bernad et al .",
    "2002 , georganopoulos et al .",
    "2002 , romero et al .",
    "2002 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show results of calculations in the case of a microquasar with an o9 i star , similar to the companion star in cygnus x-1 .",
    "we have considered the interaction of the photon field with an homogeneous jet with a power - law particle spectrum of index @xmath11 and total power proportional to the accreting rate @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the disk / jet coupling parameter ( falcke & biermann 1995 ) .",
    "the remaining parameters are as in romero et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , except for the high - energy cut - off of the particles , which is here in the tev range , corresponding to electron lorentz factors of @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of tev electrons in microquasar jets have been recently inferred from the detection of synchrotron x - ray emission in xte j1550 - 564 ( corbel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the ic emission has a peak at mev energies , due to the effect of losses on the particle spectrum . at energies above @xmath15",
    "ev the klein - nishina effect becomes important and the spectrum softens significantly . in the egret energy range , the luminosity ( per sr ) inferred in the observer system is between @xmath3 and @xmath16 erg s@xmath5 , for a doppler boosting @xmath17 , quite consistent with the expected values for low - latitude unidentified egret sources .",
    "the photon spectral index in this range is @xmath18 . at tev energies , where the spectral index is @xmath19 , the luminosity is @xmath20 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "hence , one of these microquasars located at a few kpc might be a detectable tev gamma - ray source .",
    "if there are relativistic protons in the jets of some high - mass microquasars , @xmath21 interactions with particles in the stellar wind can result in significant gamma - ray emission . in order to make quantitative estimates of the @xmath22-decay gamma - ray luminosity",
    "we have considered an o star with a mass loss rate of @xmath23 @xmath24 yr@xmath5 and a terminal wind velocity @xmath25 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the radial dependence of the wind velocity is @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "the jet is assumed to be perpendicular to the orbital plane , with a bulk lorentz factor of 5 , and injected at 50 gravitational radii ( @xmath29 ) above the black hole ( mass @xmath30 @xmath24 ) , with an initial radius of 5 @xmath29 .",
    "the jet is allowed to expand laterally , conserving the number of particles .",
    "protons in the jet have a power - law spectrum of index @xmath31 in the co - moving frame , with a high - energy cutt - off above 100 tev .",
    "the orbital radius is 2 @xmath32 .",
    "we have calculated the gamma - ray emission for @xmath33 and different combination of viewing angles and disk / jet coupling constant ( the accretion rate is the same as in the previous example : @xmath34 yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "we see that hadronic high - mass microquasars can be not only strong sources in egret energy band , but also strong tev sources .",
    "contrary to the case of ic tev microquasars , they should be sources with a hard spectrum that would mimic the spectrum of the parent population of protons .",
    "this prediction can be used to differentiate them .",
    "gamma - ray variability naturally arises in high - mass microquasar models through jet precession , shocks , and variable accretion rate onto the compact object .",
    "high - mass microquasars are originated in star forming regions , hence a concentration toward the inner spiral arms is expected .",
    "their proper motions can present velocities of a few hundred kilometers per second , but because of their rapid evolution and short lifetime they are not expected to be found far beyond the galactic disk ( rib et al .",
    "low - mass microquasars are not constrained to remain in the galactic plane .",
    "they can be ejected by kicks imparted in the natal supernova explosions to galactocentric orbits ( mirabel & rodrigues 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , some low - mass microquasars might be born in globular clusters from where they might be injected in large galactic orbits ( mirabel et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "ic up - scattering of external photons fields in the case of low - mass microquasars will not be as efficient as in the case of the high - mass objects , mainly due to the reduced stellar luminosities .",
    "we have performed calculations of the high - energy gamma - ray spectrum of low - mass microquasars within a variety of models . in fig.[fig4 ] we show some results .",
    "we have considered here not only the stellar photon field ( a k7 v - m0 v star , similar to the donor star in xte j1118 + 480 ) but also the accretion disk field and a hard x - ray component ( hc , in the figure ) , with a power - law spectrum and an exponential cut - off that represents a corona or adaf region around the central object .",
    "the jet is homogeneous , with a bulk lorentz factor of 3 , and the disk / jet coupling parameter is @xmath35 .",
    "the electron energy distribution is a power - law with index @xmath36 and a high - energy cut - off at @xmath37 . in the calculations we used the full klein - nishina cross section and we took into account the effect of losses into the particle spectrum .",
    "the resulting high - energy tail is shown for three different viewing angles : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the spectra at egret energies are soft , but the luminosities ( per sr ) are smaller than what is inferred for grp ii sources .    looking for higher luminosities ,",
    "we have considered the case of a microblazar with a viewing angle of only @xmath41 and a lorentz factor of @xmath42 , an electron energy distribution with index @xmath43 , and a high - energy cut - off @xmath44 .",
    "the rest of the parameters remain with the same value as in the previous models .",
    "the calulated spectrum is shown as curve d in fig .",
    "we see that in this case we get luminosities of around @xmath45 erg s@xmath5 ( per sr ) at egret energies .",
    "if the emission is highly beamed ( @xmath46 sr ) , luminosities similar to those of grp ii sources are obtained .",
    "the addition of a magnetic field does not significantly affect the results at gev energies unless @xmath47 g ( bosch - ramon , romero & paredes 2004 ) . with high magnetic fields , by the other hand ,",
    "strong radio sources are produced , which is at odds with the absence of radio counterparts .",
    "more detailed models will be presented elsewhere ( kaufman bernad et al . , in preparation ) but the results seem to suggest that the population of gamma - ray sources in the halo might be formed by low - mass microblazars , i.e. sources with highly relativistic and well - collimated jets forming small viewing angles .",
    "there are variable gamma - ray sources in the galaxy . there are reasons to think that at least two different populations of such sources exist : one population of young sources in the galactic plane , and one population of old sources at high latitudes , forming a halo around the galactic center .",
    "we suggest that these two groups of sources correspond to high - mass microquasars and low - mass microblazars , respectively .",
    "our calculations indicate that the required high - energy spectra and luminosities can be produced by these objects . in a separate communication ( kaufman bernad et al . in preparation ) , a detailed discussion of the source statistics will be presented . some of these sources , especially those at low latitudes with a peak at mev energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , might be detectable by integral .",
    "the recent findings by combi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) seem to be a promising step in this direction .      this work has been supported by conicet ( pict 0438/98 ) and fundacin antorchas .",
