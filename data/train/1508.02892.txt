    "the discharges operated under atmospheric pressure are easier to operate compared to the low - pressure discharges because the expensive vacuum equipment is no longer needed .",
    "however , due to their smaller size compared to the low - pressure counterparts , the experimental diagnostics proves to be more difficult .",
    "hence , numerical modeling plays an important role in facilitating the understanding of processes taking place in atmospheric pressure plasma discharges .",
    "if the scale of spatial inhomogeities in a plasma discharge is much greater than the electron energy relaxation length @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 the momentum exchange mean free path and the characteristic time scale of phenomena in interest is larger than the corresponding time scale of the energy relaxation @xmath3 ) , the spatial derivatives in the boltzmann s equation governing the electron energy distribution function ( eedf ) can be neglected and the distribution function will only implicitly depend on the spatial inhomogeneities through the spatial dependence of the electric field and the plasma parameters . in this case one can use local description for plasma behavior . however , since in most atmospheric plasmas coulomb collisions  maxwellizing  the eedf are negligible compared to the electron - neutral collisions ( usually leading to pronouncedly non - maxwellian eedfs ) one still has to determine the eedf and calculate the corresponding transport coefficients to be used in a fluid model for electrons . typically , to this end a 0d boltzmann solver @xcite is used .    whereas this popular approach is suitable for studying most atmospheric pressure discharges , there are situations where it turns out to be inadequate even in such highly collisional plasmas ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that one of the indispensable ingredients in the mechanism of striation generation in an atmospheric dielectric barrier discharge is the non - local energy transport of the electrons .",
    "in @xcite it was demonstrated for a glow discharge in helium in the @xmath0 mode that in contrast to the expected two - temperature eedf it exhibits three different energy groups of electrons .",
    "in addition to the non - maxwellian energetic tail on the distribution function of the electrons and the mid - energy group of electrons common to the glow discharges operated in the @xmath0 mode there was observed a low energy group of electrons with an unusually low temperature contributing most to the electron density .",
    "such a three - temperature eedf is impossible to model with a fluid description which usually assumes a maxwellian distribution function for electrons .",
    "the eedf becomes even more complicated and farther from the maxwellian shape when additional species , especially molecular gases , are added to the discharge .",
    "furthermore , recently it has been demonstrated in @xcite that due to the large spatial nonuniformities of the electric field atmospheric pressure plasma discharges can exhibit distinctly nonlocal energy transport even in the @xmath4 ( ohmic ) mode .",
    "these effects obviously can not be captured by the local description .",
    "yet another example of nonlocal electron energy transport in the highly collisional plasmas is studied in @xcite , where an efficient gas impurity detector based on a  short  dc discharge , which predominantly consists of the negative glow region , is proposed . since the transverse size of the discharge",
    "there is chosen to be smaller than the energy relaxation length , the energetic electrons born in penning ionization reaction can diffuse to the discharge wall where the detector is placed , retaining a large portion of its energy and thus producing pronounced peaks in the eedf .",
    "the energy of such electrons is @xmath5 with @xmath6 the excitation energy of the working gas ( chosen to be helium for the high potential energy of its metastable levels ) metastable atoms or molecules and @xmath7 the ionization energy for different background gas components .",
    "since @xmath7 is distinct for different gas impurities , it is possible to identify the gas chemical composition by tracking peaks on the eedf .",
    "if the electron energy transport had been local , the eedf of the electrons leaving the discharge would have had the maxwellian shape with no peaks on it .",
    "of particular importance is an appropriate description of energetic electrons .",
    "although the number of such electrons is too small to affect the plasma bulk dynamics , these electrons are essential for the plasma sustainment as they significantly contribute to the particle balance through the ionization processes , which have threshold at relatively high energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower energy electrons determine the bulk plasma dynamics , which in turn governs generation of the electric field accelerating the high energy electrons .",
    "therefore , it is important to correctly reproduce the correct energy distribution function of the electrons describing all its groups .",
    "the details of ion energy distribution function in the atmospheric pressure plasma discharges are , in contrast , rarely of significance as they have much smaller collisional mean free path than electrons and thus have the maxwellian form in all cases of practical importance .",
    "this has motivated us to use a hybrid numerical scheme where ions are described using the fluid approximation and the electrons are followed kinetically .",
    "furthermore , most of the experimental data concerning the ion - neutral collisions are provided in the form of the reaction rates ( it is much easier to find the differential cross - sections for the electron - atom or electron - molecule collisions ) and not the energy - resolved collision cross - sections , which further renders the kinetic description of the ions an overkill .",
    "the fluid description employed for ions also simplifies bookkeeping of the potentially complex chemistry taking place between the neutral and charged species and the kinetic description of the electrons ensures an accurate energy and particle balance in the numerical description of the discharge .",
    "an additional advantage of using a fluid description for the heavy particle species is that it requires much less computer memory compared to the kinetic description .",
    "although this argument does not play a significant role in 1d simulations , it can become important as long as one wants to study multidimensional models with the kinetic part of the algorithm parallelized on graphics processing units ( gpus ) , as the latter usually have dedicated limited memory which can not be expanded .    in the present work we propose a hybrid approach , where electrons are followed utilizing the fully kinetic particle - in - cell technique and ions",
    "are described using a fluid model . before one can trust the numerical results of a particular model",
    ", such a model has to be validated and verified by comparing its results with either an analytical treatment or results of a well established model .",
    "should such a comparision demonstrate any discrepancies , they should be amenable to an explanation based on the model differences . that is the main goal of the present work",
    "in the present work we study plasma dynamics across the discharge channel in a rf - driven plasma ( ccp ) planar discharge at atmospheric pressure , such a micro - jet discharge .",
    "correspondigly , we limit ourselves to 1d spatial dimension with @xmath8 coordinate being the distance from the powered electrode . the driven ( grounded ) electrode is located at @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . following the logic outlined in the introduction section , we adopt a kinetic description for the electron and a fluid description for the ion and neutral species .",
    "the resulting approach enables an efficient implementation of numerical model for discharges featuring a complicated chemistry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the electron dynamics is traced numerically using the pic technique @xcite , where the electron particle distribution function is discretized on a moving lagrangian grid with a number of markers following the characteristics of the boltzmann s equation , and the electric field is discretized on a stationary eulerian grid .",
    "the markers used for the representation of the particle distribution function can be also regarded as  superparticles  representing a large number of physical particles , which are close to each other in phase space , so that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the superparticle shape function and @xmath13 is weight of the @xmath14th particle . in case of a field grid uniform in @xmath8 and homogeneous initial plasma density ( which we take to be the case in the present work ) , it is convenient to take the same weight for all superparticles , @xmath15 with @xmath16 the initial electron density and @xmath17 the initial number of superparticles per field grid cell .",
    "this results in the following number of real particles per superparticle , @xmath18 with @xmath19 the grid cell volume , @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the field grid cell size and @xmath22 the electrode area , respectively .",
    "the pic / mcc numerical scheme describing the electrons in our implementation consists of four parts : particle pusher , particle removal , charge density assignment , and the monte - carlo collisions module . in the particle pusher particles",
    "are moved in phase space by integrating the newton s equations of particle motion under influence of the electric field .",
    "this is done using the explicit leapfrog scheme with the electric field interpolated from the field grid nodes to the particle position with the interpolation function @xmath23 being the same as the particle shape function @xmath22 in eq.([eq1.1 ] ) , which we chose to be of the cloud - in - cell ( cic ) variety ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the superparticle weight remains constant during the particle pusher part of the pic / mcc algorithm due to liouville s theorem .",
    "the pusher algorithm also checks if a particle gets reflected or generates new particles at the borders of the computational domain due to the corresponding surface processes , such as generation of the secondary electrons , by using corresponding probability .",
    "after the particle pusher is completed , it is checked if a particle leaves the computational domain .",
    "should it be the case , the particle is removed .",
    "further , one calculates charge density of the electron component by extrapolating the superparticle charge to the surrounding field grid nodes . finally , a monte - carlo technique is used to implement the collisions between the electron and the heavy species ( charged and neutral ) . to this end",
    ", we exploit a variety of the `` null - collision '' method described in @xcite . rather than taking @xmath24 number of electrons for executing a collision algorithm with @xmath25 the total number of electrons and @xmath26 the maximum  null - collision  frequency , one checks if @xmath27 with @xmath28 the pseudorandom number uniformly distributed in @xmath29 $ ] for every particle . in electron collisions with the background neutral gas atoms or molecules the latter",
    "are treated as having a uniform density and any change of its density and temperature in the course of the discharge evolution is assumed to be negligible . in contrast , when treating collisions of electrons with the other species such as metastables and ions , the density profiles of the latter species are taken into account .",
    "when only a reaction rate is available , we deduce energy dependence from the reaction rate electron temperature dependence based on the maxwellian ansatz and then use the resulting energy - resolved cross - section in the simulations similar to @xcite .",
    "a proper choice of pseudorandom number generator is also important as the number of collisions in simulating such highly collisional plasmas is large and a good pseudorandom generator should have an appropriately long period . for our hybrid code",
    "we used the 128 bit xoorshift pseudorandom number generator suggested in @xcite , which has period of @xmath30 .",
    "to accelerate the computations , the kinetic pic / mcc part of the present hybrid code was implemented on a graphics processing unit ( gpu ) analagous to the gpu pic / mcc code used in the benchmarking study @xcite .",
    "the cell size @xmath21 was limited by the need to resolve the debye length in order to avoid excessive numerical heating ( in our simulations we took @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is debye length calculated using the maximum expected electron density @xmath33 ) and the time step was limited by the need to resolve the elastic collisions ( we took @xmath34 with @xmath35 the maximum value of the elastic collisions over the computational energy domain ) .",
    "in contrast to the kinetic treatment of the electron component , the heavy species transport is followed using a fluid model .",
    "in such a model the heavy particle density is governed by the particle continuity equation , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the heavy particle species subscript , @xmath38 is the heavy particle flux with @xmath39 the average ordered velocity of this species , and @xmath40 the net density change rate due to the reactions where such particles are either born or destroyed . in general case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) the heavy particle flux is governed by equation which can be obtained by multiplying the boltzmann s equation by particle velocity and integrating it over velocity space , which yields @xmath41 with @xmath42 the electric field , @xmath43 the species charge number , @xmath44 its mass , @xmath45 the species temperature , @xmath46 the momentum exchange frequency of the species with the neutral background gas @xmath47 , and the expression in the brackets of the second term on the left hand side is a dyadic tensor . in the atmospheric pressure plasma discharges the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) is normally neglected and the ion fluxes are calculated from the right hand side of this equation ( drift - diffusion approximation , see the next section ) .",
    "however , it is pointed out in @xcite that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) vanishes only after the equilibrium drift velocity is achieved and it takes several nanoseconds for a heavy ion to accomplish it .",
    "a large ion flux gradient , which can arise in a highly collisional discharge , for example , due to the intense ionizing electron avalanche in the @xmath0 mode , can cause the second term on the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) to be of significance as well . since the drift - diffusion approximation is also frequently used for lower pressure discharges ( up to 100 mtorr ) , the explicit time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) can clearly become comparable with the last term in this parameter range .",
    "all this suggests that the left hand side of the latter equation can be substantial and it is interesting to verify how close the results of the full model utilizing eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) are to the results of the popular drift - diffusion approximation under different conditions .    finally , we note that the energy transport equation is usually omitted for the heavy species since they come into the thermodynamical equilibrium with the background neutral gas really fast due to the efficient collisional energy exchange in contrast to the electrons . under this assumption",
    "the temperature is usually approximated as @xmath48 for the neutral species and by eq .",
    "( [ eq2.8 ] ) for the ion species .    a convenient numerical scheme for solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) and ( [ eq2.1 ] ) employs the leapfrog time intergration approach , where discretization of the density @xmath49 is performed at integral time levels , and the flux @xmath50 is taken at time levels half a time step apart . in the particular scheme that we have used in this study one first calculates the particle flux at the next time level , so that in the one dimensional case the corresponding equations read @xmath51 for @xmath52 , which can be easily found by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the equations at the boundary nodes are obtained by the same integration procedure using the corresponding intervals @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] , respectively . the procedure being straightforward",
    ", we omit the results .",
    "note that the advection term on the l.h.s .",
    "of these equations is discretized semi - implicitly , which helps to keep the equations linear and tridiagonal .",
    "then , they can be easily solved , for example , by using the thomas method .",
    "generally speaking , the momentum exchange frequency depends on velocity @xmath57 , which is spatially nonuniform . to avoid the need for an iterative solver we use @xmath58 , which reduces the order of the numerical scheme , but we find in the benchmark comparisons with pic simulations the resulting accuracy to be still sufficient due to the small time - step caused by the need to resolve the collisions in the pic / mcc part of the algorithm describing electrons .",
    "a higher oder alternative would be to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2.4 ] ) iteratively , which is more computationally expensive .",
    "although the diffusion term proved to be small in all the cases we considered , we still retained it , albeit using a simplified expression from the drift - diffusion approximation given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.7 ] ) and ( [ eq2.8 ] ) . to determine the velocity - dependent momentum exchange frequency @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.3 ] ) we have constructed an auxiliary monte - carlo code , which calculates it based on the energy resolved collisional cross - sections . a detailed desciption of the latter code is given in the next subsection .",
    "after the particle flux at the next half - integer time level is found , one can obtain the value of the density at the next integer time level from the particle continuity equation , @xmath60 for @xmath52 , which is derived by integrating the particle continuity equation over @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "equations for the bondary points @xmath62 and @xmath63 are obtained similarly by integrating over the corresponding intervals @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] and are not shown here . for the sake of simplicity in our numerical implementation we substitute @xmath64 with @xmath65 , which degrades accuracy of the scheme . however , by comparison with the pic simulations we conclude that the resulting accuracy is still sufficient not to cause a significant deviation from the fully kinetic calculations .      in the frequently used drift - diffusion approximation",
    "the particle fluxes are assumed to have reached a quasi - stationary value , so that the left hand side of eq.([eq2.2 ] ) is neglected . in this case the particle flux is approximated as @xmath66 with @xmath67 the heavy particle mobility ( note that it equals zero for neutral species ) , and @xmath68 the heavy particle diffusion rate .",
    "the diffusion rate accounting for the impact of electric field on the ion diffusivity is obtained by using the generalized einstein s relation @xcite , @xmath69 with @xmath70 using the expression for particle flux in the drift - diffusion approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.5 ] ) one can obtain particle density from eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) . this equation can be solved either explicitly ( by taking the particle flux values not at the time level @xmath71 , but @xmath49 ) , in which case the boundary condition is not needed , or , for example , semi - implicitly ( if the original form of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) is retained . in the latter case",
    "the boundary conditions come from the kinetic limitation on the particle flux to the wall for the neutral species , @xmath72 with @xmath73 the normal vector to the corresponding electrode , and from the assumption of the electric field dominated particle flux to the wall for the ions , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the switching function , taking value @xmath76 when @xmath77 and @xmath78 when @xmath79 , respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is essential to correctly determine the momentum exchange frequency @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.3 ] ) and the mobilities in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.5 ] ) ( note that one of these quantities can be calculated from the other utilizing eq .",
    "( [ eq2.6 ] ) ) caused by collisions of ion species with the helium background gas . although ion mobilities are often assumed to be constant ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , a better approximation attempted from the physics considerations yielding dependence of the mobilities on the electric field demonstrates that such a dependence can matter @xcite . following the latter argument , in the present work we propose to calculate mobilities and the corresponding momentum exchange frequency with help of the following auxiliary monte - carlo code .",
    "the code resembles very much a pic / mcc code where only one of the ion species is traced .",
    "the particles are evolved in time under action of a prescribed constant electric field @xmath80 and collisions with the background neutral gas having a temperature @xmath48 .",
    "the collisions are modeled using the monte - carlo method with the same energy resolved cross - sections as in the full pic code . at the initial moment",
    "the particle velocities are sampled from a maxwellian distribution with an initial temperature @xmath81 .",
    "the computational domain is assumed to have periodic boundaries .",
    "after several nanoseconds the ions acquire the stationary drift velocity ( see figure 6 in @xcite and the accompanying discussion in that reference ) , which can be determined by calculating the total mean velocity of the particle ensemble",
    ". carrying out this procedure for a number of the electric field values , one can construct a look - up table or an analytic fit of mobility ( calculated as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the drift velocity ) and momentum exchange frequency ( calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq2.6 ] ) ) versus the electric field and the drift velocity , respectively .",
    "following the suggestion in @xcite , we use both in the full pic and the monte - carlo code for the ion isotropic scattering the cross - section equal to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the elastic isotropic cross - section and @xmath86 is the elastic backward scattering cross - section .    note",
    "that this technique is more general than the one suggested in @xcite .",
    "it enables an accurate calculation of the momentum exchange frequencies and mobilities for any species , for which energy - resolved collision cross - sections are known , and under any conditions of practical interest ( for example , when the colliding species have different velocity distribution functions with comparable but distinct characteristic energy / temperature ) .",
    "calculation of the corresponding collision frequencies and mobilities has to be performed only once for a given pressure of the background helium gas and thus does not cause any computational overhead in the hybrid code simulations .",
    "coupling of the kinetic electron and the fluid ion models occurs through the net charge density in the poisson s equation , which includes both electron and ion densities and through any reaction involving both electrons and ions . among the typical reactions",
    "are the secondary electron emission caused by ions impinging on the electrode surfaces , production of electrons and positive ions in the electron impact , penning and the metastable pooling ionization reactions , and recombination reactions of electrons with positive ions .",
    "once the charge densities are calculated , the poisson s equation has to be solved . in order to achieve a needed regime of operation for the discharge in numerical simulations",
    "one has to limit the current flowing through the discharge .",
    "if it is not done ( for example , if a fixed voltage amplitude rf source is used in the simulations ) , the number of superparticles and hence the particle density tend to diverge with time as the modeled discharge spontaneously goes into the @xmath0 regime with an ever increasing current . in order to limit the total current in the simulations one can chose either to use a fixed amplitude currrent source or , if a fixed amplitude voltage source is used , either to use an external resistance or to limit the power absorbed in the discharge by adjusting the voltage amplitude to meet the prescribed power .",
    "the latter approach seems to correspond to experimental observations better , the latter showing generation of additional harmonics rather in the measured current than in the voltage signal @xcite . to adapt the voltage ampltide for matching the prescribed power we have implemented the following simple algorithm .",
    "starting from an initial guess for the voltage amplitude @xmath87 , during each rf period the voltage ampltiude remains fixed and the period - averaged power absorbed by the discharge during the @xmath47th period is calculated as @xmath88 , where @xmath22 is the electrode area , @xmath89 is the voltage , @xmath90 is the rf period , @xmath14 and @xmath91 are the conduction current and the displacement current densities at the driven electrode .",
    "the new value for the voltage amplitude during the @xmath92th rf period is calculated as @xmath93 with @xmath94 the prescribed power and @xmath75 some numerical parameter , which can be chosen to be small for a smoother or large for a faster adjustment , respectively .",
    "it can be also be chosen to be time - adaptive , for example , being larger at the beginning of the simulation and smaller as the simulation proceeds .    the secondary electron emission algorithm is implemented by employing the following technique .",
    "the number of heavy particles ( ions or metastables ) @xmath95 hitting an electrode during a time interval @xmath96 equals to @xmath97 .",
    "each such heavy particle can produce a secondary electron with probabilty equal to @xmath98 , which results in an average number of secondary electrons produced during a time step equal to @xmath99 .",
    "this translates to @xmath100 superparticles with @xmath101 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.2 ] ) .",
    "thus , during each time step one produces @xmath102 ( with @xmath103 representing the integral part of a number ) electrons and performs a comparison of the @xmath28 uniformly distributed pseudorandom number with @xmath104 .",
    "if the former is smaller than the latter , one additional secondary electron superparticle is produced .",
    "such a monte - carlo technique ensures correct number of secondary electrons generated on average .",
    "the electron impact ionization is treated according to the modified null - method described in @xcite .",
    "when an impact ionization or a metastable excitation event occurs , a corresponding location of the newly produced ions or metastable species are recorded and the corresponding ion or metastable density is incremented by @xmath105 with @xmath19 the grid cell volume along with creation of a new electron superparticle .",
    "velocity of the ejected electrode is determined by a random scattering on a sphere in velocity space with radius corresponding to the energy of the ejected electron @xcite .",
    "ionization events due to the penning or the metastable pooling reactions are treated in a similar fashion , but with the number of electron superparticles corrected with regard to the corresponding reaction .",
    "for example , for the penning ionization such number is equal to @xmath106 , where number of electrons produced during a time step is equal to @xmath107 with @xmath28 the corresponding reaction rate , @xmath108 the density of the corresponding metastable species and @xmath109 the density of the background neutral gas ionized by the metastable species . as in the case of the impact ionization , velocity of the electron created in such a process is to be found by scattering on a sphere in velocity space with radius calculated from the corresponding energy ( different for each of the processes ) .",
    "the recombination reactions between electrons and positive ions are accounted for numerically as follows .",
    "first , the maximum collision probability during a time step is calculated as @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "then , the rest of the null collision procedure goes as the previously mentioned modified null - collision method of @xcite with a correction respecting the nonuniform ion density profile when calculating the actual collision probability .",
    "when a recombination event occurs , the corresponding electron superparticle is removed from the computational domain and the corresponding ion density is decremented by @xmath105 .",
    ".electron - neutral collisions [ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     [ t7 ]     mode , 300 mtorr ) obtained by the pic / mcc code and different versions of the hybrid code , see text.,width=453 ]    finally , to test how accurate are the ion fluid models at lower pressures we have studied an example of a pure he discharge operated at 300 mtorr pressure of the he working gas , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . the corresponding momentum exchange frequencies and mobilities to be used in the ion fluid models were calculated with the monte - carlo code described before and fit with analytic functions as shown in tables  [ t6 ] and [ t7 ] . at such a pressure",
    "the momentum exchange frequency becomes comparable to the driving frequency and one can expect that the explicit ion flux time modulation on the left hand side in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) becomes comparable with the right hand side .",
    "this should lead to a breakdown of the drift - diffusion approximation .",
    "indeed , the corresponding results ( see fig .  4 ) demonstrate that even the @xmath4 mode ( more commonly referred to as the @xmath75 mode at such pressure ) is not properly simulated by the hybrid code using the drift - diffusion simulation with a realistic mobility ( hc2 ) .",
    "in contrast , the hybrid code version utilizing the full ion fluid model is in an excellent agreement with the kinetic result .",
    "therefore , despite the drift - diffusion model is frequently used in the literature also at low pressures , one must be very careful in interpreting its results , as its assumptions are very likely to be violated there .",
    "the present work describes a hybrid numerical scheme that can be used for simulations of highly collisional discharges with a complex chemistry .",

    "a simple numerical scheme is proposed .",
    "its results are confronted with results of the purely kinetic pic / mcc code and the popular drift - diffusion approach for several exemplary discharges in regimes of practical interest .",
    "it is demonstrated that the drift - diffusion model with the constant mobility performs well for plasma discharges under atmospheric pressure unless the discharge is operated deeply in the @xmath0 regime with heavy ion species present .",
    "it is also shown that the drift - diffusion approximation breaks down at lower pressures , whereas the hybrid code version with the  full  fluid model remains very close to predictions of the kinetic code .",
    "it is worth noting that the proposed ion fluid model taking into account ion inertia imposes only a minor complication of the numerical algorithm compared to the popular numerical schemes using the drift - diffusion approximation , which consists in solving an additional equation for the ion flux .",
