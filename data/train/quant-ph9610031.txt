    "it was recognized over a decade ago by deutsch @xcite that a quantum computer has the potential to perform certain computational tasks much more efficiently than its classical counterparts , and the most striking example to date is the factorization of large numbers proposed by shor @xcite",
    ". the advent of quantum computation would also enable the realization of arbitrary quantum measurement processes and ultimately the efficient simulation of physical systems as envisaged by feynman @xcite .",
    "a measurement scheme recently presented by the authors @xcite illustrates the usefulness of quantum computations in generating a `` difficult '' operator transformation in the context of an ion trap .    the possibility of building a quantum computer has received a lot of attention in the last few years , following several implementation proposals based on well - known physical systems . at this stage , ion traps @xcite and",
    "optical cavities @xcite are the leading candidates , and experimental work has progressed to the point of demonstrating the operation of two - bit quantum gates @xcite .",
    "a major hurdle in the implementation of a quantum computer is that the presence of decoherence in any open physical system introduces random errors in the computation process , which will grow with time if left unchecked .    to illustrate the importance of this problem ,",
    "plenio and knight @xcite have considered the fundamental limitation imposed on shor s factorization algorithm by decoherence due to spontaneous emission .",
    "the maximum computation time @xmath0 available on an @xmath1-qubit register is bounded by the decoherence time @xmath2 , which can be expressed as @xmath3 if the qubits are coupled to the environment independently , where @xmath4 is the decoherence time of a single qubit . in the case of a linear rf trap ,",
    "the switching rate of the laser pulses used to implement quantum gates is directly proportional to the rabi frequency @xmath5 , which depends on the spontaneous emission rate @xmath6 of the qubit transitions ( @xmath7 ) , therefore the execution time of an elementary logic gate ultimately depends on the qubit decoherence time @xmath8 .",
    "thus the dependence of the computation time on the number of input bits ( @xmath9 bits for a decimal integer @xmath10 ) was shown to be much stronger @xmath11 than that obtained by assuming the logic gates can be performed in a time independent of the qubit decoherence time , @xmath12 this result implies that factorizing a 4-bit number using shor s algorithm would be very difficult to implement experimentally , whereas the factorization of nontrivial numbers with hundreds of bits appears impossible for the trapped - ion realization of a quantum computer .",
    "hence quantum error - correcting codes are necessary to run error - free computations , and a number of recent papers @xcite have addressed this issue .",
    "the proposed codes allow for an arbitrary interaction between qubits and their environments , and prevent memory errors by redundantly encoding the information contained in logical qubits across an entanglement of several physical qubits .",
    "the resulting entangled states are known as * quantum codewords * , which can be decoded to give logical qubits , and the additional qubits required to implement the codes are labeled the * ancilla*.    the codewords can be recovered after each decoherence event using coherent feedback , given that only one qubit out of each codeword decoheres .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the most efficient perfect code which can correct all one - bit errors using a minimum number of ancillary qubits , consists of five - qubit codewords .",
    "the problem of additional errors introduced by decoherence and inaccuracies during the error correction process was recently addressed by divincenzo and shor @xcite .",
    "the quantum gates used to implement error - correcting codes often depend on analog parameters , hence they need to be fault - tolerant in order to achieve robust computation which yields correct results even in the presence of moderate levels of noise .    in contrast to the general schemes referred to above , we only consider the errors arising from one source of decoherence , namely spontaneous emission , in a quantum computer based on an ion trap .",
    "this implies that our error - correcting codes are limited in scope , however they are directly applicable to experiment , and use a minimum of additional memory resources .",
    "our physical system consists of n ions confined in a linear rf trap , as proposed by cirac and zoller @xcite for the implementation of a quantum computer .",
    "each of the ions is laser - cooled into the lamb - dicke limit , and experiences harmonic motion at the trapping frequency @xmath13 of a collective vibrational mode .",
    "qubits are represented by two - level electronic transitions @xmath14 consisting of hyperfine levels in order to minimize the atomic recoil from spontaneous emission events .",
    "one - bit and two - bit quantum gates are realized by applying carrier and sideband raman laser pulses to the appropriate ion(s ) , using the collective vibrational mode as a common bus to achieve ion - ion coupling .",
    "the errors experienced by an n - ion register running a quantum computation can be conveniently divided into memory and gate errors .",
    "memory errors affect qubits when they are simply stored in the trap , and are due to decoherence from a number of sources including spontaneous emission from qubits , vibrational heating due to technical imperfections in the trap , and collisions with residual gas molecules .",
    "gate errors arise during quantum gate operations due to decoherence from the same sources as above , or from technical inaccuracies involved in applying a gate , such as the timing of laser pulses .    a quantum error correction scheme rendering quantum gates tolerant to errors introduced by vibrational damping of the ions",
    "was recently proposed by cirac _",
    "et al . _",
    "their scheme redundantly encodes logical qubits in four electronic levels of each ion , and inverts the effects of quantum jumps of the phonon number using projection measurements to provide non - unitary feedback and restore the initial state , so that the gate can be repeated .",
    "fault - tolerance is achieved by applying a measurement projecting onto the ideal state , if no jump occurs during the gate operation .",
    "the size of the quantum network which can be realized without any errors is squared relative to the uncorrected case , since the first order effects of decoherence are eliminated .    in this article",
    "we present two quantum error - correcting codes which address only those memory errors introduced by spontaneous emission from the upper levels of qubits @xmath15 to the respective ground levels @xmath16 , at the decay rate @xmath17 for the @xmath18-th ion . without any error correction , the maximum storage time for qubits in an n - ion register",
    "can be estimated by the decoherence time @xmath19n , assuming that the spontaneous emission rates of the ions are equal but independent of each other .",
    "the upper levels are typically chosen to be metastable levels , hence the decoherence time for a single qubit ( @xmath20 ) can be as long as one minute .    in both of our schemes , the initial state of the ion register",
    "is prepared in an entangled state , ie .  a quantum codeword @xmath21 which belongs to a logical hilbert subspace @xmath22 .",
    "quantum jumps corresponding to spontaneous emission events are continuously monitored using photodetectors positioned around the ion trap , and when a jump is detected , its effect on the system is immediately inverted using selective coherent feedback . mabuchi and zoller @xcite",
    "have shown that the inversion of quantum jumps is possible if quantum codewords are uniquely mapped by the jumps into error states which can be transformed unitarily back to the logical subspace @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the spontaneous emission events from different ions are distinguishable , so that the feedback process can be applied selectively to the system to recover the initial codeword @xmath21 , in a time much shorter than the decoherence time of the ion register , thus ensuring that no spontaneous emission occurs before the codeword is restored .     as emphasized by plenio _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently , the quantum codewords used for the register need to be invariant under the conditional time evolution between jumps , so that the state prior to each decay event is known to be a codeword .",
    "the conditional time evolution causes the ion register to evolve non - unitarily according to the transformation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spontaneous emission rate of all the excited levels , and the state of the register has been transformed to an interaction picture which eliminates the free evolution of the ions . thus the quantum codewords have to be restricted to a logical hilbert subspace consisting of register states which have the same number of excited ions .    in the following section we outline the use of an alternative logical basis consisting of fourier - transformed states , and",
    "present an error correction scheme for individual qubits based on entangling two ions for each codeword .",
    "we then consider an error correction scheme for an n - ion register , which uses complementary electronic number states to realize codewords in a very efficient manner .",
    "for the purposes of quantum computation with an ion trap , a fourier - transformed basis @xmath25 can be used as an alternative to the logical basis @xmath10 comprising the electronic levels @xmath26 .",
    "the fourier - transformed states @xmath27 making up @xmath25 , are orthogonal superpositions of the electronic levels , @xmath28 the basis @xmath25 holds the advantage that both amplitude coefficients of an arbitrary qubit can be preserved when there is a spontaneous emission from the excited level @xmath29 , hence enabling us to recover the initial qubit .",
    "one - bit quantum gates are implemented in basis @xmath10 by applying a standing wave @xmath30-pulse @xmath31 ( with laser phase @xmath32 ) to the @xmath33-th ion , @xmath34 \\hspace{2.5 mm},\\ ] ] to rotate the respective electronic levels .",
    "the laser pulse is on resonance with the electronic transition @xmath35 , and the equilibrium position of the ion is placed at an antinode of the standing wave for the duration of the pulse .",
    "the same unitary transformation @xmath31 also implements rotations in @xmath25 . for example",
    ", a laser pulse @xmath36 can be used to swap between the basis states of @xmath10 and @xmath25 , @xmath37    cirac and zoller @xcite have shown how one - bit rotations and a series of sideband laser pulses , with the equilibrium positions of the ions at the nodes of the respective standing waves , can be used to implement a controlled - not gate @xmath38 in basis @xmath10 , for two ions @xmath39 , @xmath40 employing a vibrational mode common to the ions .",
    "the control qubit @xmath33 remains unchanged , whereas the target qubit @xmath18 flips in the case that the control qubit is set to @xmath41 .",
    "an experimental realization of this quantum gate has been demonstrated recently by monroe _",
    "et al . _",
    "the same transformation @xmath38 applied to the logical states of @xmath25 , also implements a controlled - not gate , @xmath42 except that the control and target qubits are interchanged .",
    "since the necessary one - bit and two - bit quantum gates can be realized using known unitary transformations on the ion register , any arbitrary quantum computation can be implemented in the logical basis @xmath25 . given an arbitrary state @xmath43 for ion @xmath44 , the corresponding qubit @xmath45 in the @xmath25 basis , @xmath46 can be prepared by applying a @xmath47 laser pulse , as shown in eqs.([pi/2-pulse1]-[pi/2-pulse2 ] ) .",
    "the encoding process of our error correction scheme is implemented by entangling this arbitrary qubit with a second qubit from another ion @xmath48 . assuming that @xmath48 is in the ground state @xmath49 initially , a @xmath50 laser pulse is applied to prepare it in the logical state @xmath51 .",
    "then a controlled - not gate @xmath52 is applied to the ions ( using @xmath44 as the control qubit ) to obtain the desired codeword , @xmath53 which can be maintained indefinitely using coherent feedback immediately following the detection of spontaneous emission events . when required , the initial qubit @xmath45 can be recovered from this codeword by applying another controlled - not gate @xmath52 to disentangle the ions .    if spontaneous emission occurs from the excited level of ion @xmath44 , so that the state of the system is reduced to @xmath54 the amplitude coefficients of the original qubit are preserved , and the codeword @xmath55 can be restored by the coherent feedback process presented below , which is also illustrated in figure  [ feedback_1 ] .",
    "first a @xmath56 laser pulse is applied to rotate the state of ion @xmath44 into a logical state , i.e. , @xmath57 , @xmath58 then a controlled - not gate @xmath59 is applied to entangle the ions , @xmath60 and finally a @xmath61 laser pulse is applied to flip the logical states of qubit @xmath44 , @xmath62 thus restoring the codeword @xmath55 .",
    "we have assumed that we know which ion has emitted spontaneously , so that we can apply this feedback process selectively to the appropriate ions .",
    "if spontaneous emission occurs from the excited level of ion @xmath48 , the same process is used to recover the codeword @xmath55 , with the ions @xmath63 interchanged .    to achieve codeword invariance under the conditional time evolution given in eq.([cond_evolution ] ) , the number of excited states @xmath15 has to be constant for each elementary state in basis @xmath64 making up a codeword , so that the damping terms due to the conditional time evolution factor out without distorting the codeword",
    ". thus the proposed codeword @xmath65 can be preserved between quantum jumps by a process of complementary extension , which results in a doubling of the register size .",
    "the elementary codewords @xmath66 , @xmath67 can be made invariant with respect to the conditional time evolution by entangling each @xmath64-basis product state of the ions @xmath68 with its complementary product state from a second set of ions @xmath69 , resulting in a symmetrization of the codewords .",
    "this encoding process can be achieved by setting the ions @xmath69 in the excited state @xmath70 initially and applying two controlled - not gates @xmath71 to obtain the extended codeword @xmath72 , which can be written in terms of the electronic states for basis @xmath64 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "however a new feedback process is now required to invert the effect of quantum jumps on this extended codeword . first a @xmath75 laser pulse is applied to the ion from which the decay event is detected , and then the product states of all four ions are complemented to recover @xmath72 , using the transformation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the complement of @xmath78 ( modulo @xmath79 ) .",
    "this feedback process has been adopted in the following section to invert the effect of quantum jumps on codewords consisting of complementary electronic number states , in order to implement an improved error - correcting code , which requires less ancillary qubits .",
    "the electronic number states @xmath80 of a system of n trapped ions form a logical basis , and are defined by the product of the individual electronic levels of the ions arranged in some definite order , @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents a ground or excited state respectively .",
    "an n - ion register has @xmath83 electronic number states labeled by the integer @xmath84 @xmath85 representing the binary string @xmath86 .",
    "spontaneous emission from the excited level @xmath15 of the @xmath18-th ion eliminates the amplitude coefficients of the number states @xmath87 which include the ground state @xmath16 , and are labeled by the integers @xmath88 containing @xmath89 .",
    "however the amplitude coefficients of the complementary number states @xmath90 are preserved , where @xmath91 is the complement of @xmath88 ( modulo @xmath83 ) . therefore if the initial state @xmath21 is prepared so that the amplitude coefficients of the electronic number states @xmath80 and @xmath92 are equal for all @xmath30 , @xmath93 then @xmath21 can be restored after a spontaneous emission event from any of the ions .    given an arbitrary ( n-1)-ion state @xmath94 the required n - ion codeword @xmath21 can be generated by coupling @xmath95 to the ground state of an additional ion @xmath96 and complementing each n - ion electronic number state @xmath97 .",
    "the original ( n-1)-ion state @xmath95 can be recovered from the codeword by applying this transformation in reverse to disentangle the n - th ion from the other qubits .",
    "the complementing procedure is also used to restore the codeword after a spontaneous emission event , as shown in figure  [ feedback_2 ] , and its implementation is presented below .",
    "we consider a three ion register to demonstrate our error - correcting code .",
    "an arbitrary 2-ion ( @xmath98 ) state given by @xmath99 is transformed into the required codeword @xmath21 by coupling it to a third ion @xmath100 and applying a complementing procedure , @xmath101 where the electronic number states @xmath102 for the ions @xmath103 , are labeled by @xmath104 .",
    "hence , if spontaneous emission occurs from the excited level of ion @xmath48 for example , the codeword is reduced to @xmath105 and the original amplitude coefficients are preserved .    the feedback process necessary to restore the codeword @xmath21 consists of two steps .",
    "first a @xmath106 laser pulse is applied to ion @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath107 , to match the amplitude coefficients with their initial electronic number states , @xmath108 and then each electronic number state is complemented , ie .",
    "@xmath109 , to obtain the codeword @xmath21 .",
    "the required complementing transformation @xmath110 is an extension of the two - bit controlled - not gate to n+1 ions , and therefore requires a vibrational mode common to all the ions .",
    "an extra ion @xmath111 is prepared in the superposition @xmath112 , and then entangled with the other ions . each electronic number state @xmath80 coupled to ion @xmath111 , @xmath113 is transformed by a series of controlled - not gates @xmath114 ( applied sequentially in any order ) , which leave qubit @xmath111 unchanged , @xmath115 while complementing @xmath80 , to transform the state from eq.([xsuper ] ) into @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the complement of @xmath118 ( modulo 2 ) .",
    "we note that the controlled - not gates in the sequence @xmath114 could be implemented simultaneously , using an ( n+1)-bit quantum gate .    in the feedback process",
    "used to restore @xmath21 , a @xmath119 laser pulse is first applied after spontaneous emission from the @xmath18-th ion , which sets the @xmath18-th digit of the remaining electronic number states to @xmath120 .",
    "hence after applying the controlled - not sequence @xmath114 , the ancillary ion @xmath111 can be disentangled from the @xmath1-ion number states by applying one more controlled - not gate @xmath121 , using ion @xmath18 which decayed spontaneously as the control qubit .",
    "the resultant state of the ion register is given by @xmath122 for the electronic number state @xmath123 , thus realizing the required complementing transformation @xmath124 in the case that the complementing transformation is used to encode the arbitrary state @xmath95 , the @xmath1-th digit of the @xmath1-ion number states has been set to @xmath125 by preparing the @xmath1-th ion in the ground state , therefore the last step disentangling the ancillary ion should consist of applying the controlled - not gate @xmath126 , using ion @xmath1 as the control qubit .",
    "once again we have assumed that the continuous monitoring of spontaneous emission enables us to know which ion has emitted spontaneously , so that the coherent feedback process can be applied selectively .",
    "the resonant @xmath127-pulse @xmath75 is applied to the particular ion from which spontaneous emission is detected , and is followed by the complementing procedure to recover the initial codeword .    as in the previous section",
    ", the codeword @xmath21 can be made invariant under the conditional time evolution between quantum jumps by entangling each electronic number state with its complementary number state from a second set of @xmath1 ions .",
    "thus the number of excited states @xmath15 is constant for each elementary @xmath128-ion state making up the extended codeword , and equal to @xmath1 .",
    "this encoding process can be achieved for @xmath21 by setting the second set of ions in the state @xmath129 initially and applying a series of @xmath1 controlled - not gates @xmath130 to pairs of ions from the first @xmath131 and second @xmath132 sets , in order to obtain the symmetrized codeword @xmath133 , @xmath134    in this case , the same feedback process presented above can be used to invert the effect of quantum jumps on the codeword @xmath133 , using the complementing transformation @xmath135 which involves the electronic number states of all @xmath128 ions in the register .",
    "the efficiency of the proposed error - correcting codes can be compared by considering their demands on memory and time resources . in both cases",
    "the requirement for ancillary qubits is reduced compared to the general schemes discussed in section [ introduction ] , which require the codeword encoding each logical qubit to use at least five qubits for `` perfect '' error correction , as shown by laflamme et al .",
    "@xcite , and can not correct for the conditional time evolution .    the quantum error correction scheme based on fourier - transformed states can be extended to more logical qubits in a straightforward manner , eliminating the effects of spontaneous emission using four - qubit codewords , and thus storing @xmath1 logical qubits on a @xmath136-ion register , taking into account the extra ion required for the complementing transformation .    on the other hand , the error - correcting code employing @xmath128-ion complementary number states can store @xmath1 logical qubits on a @xmath137-ion register , and evidently uses available memory resources ( trapped ions ) more efficiently , especially for large numbers of logical qubits .",
    "however the price paid for this saving is that the feedback process involves acting on all the ions to correct a spontaneous emission event , rather than only four ions , hence this code requires more time ( logic gate operations ) and is harder to implement experimentally .",
    "the time required for the feedback process can be estimated from the number of quantum gates used in its implementation , which is shown in table [ table ] for the storage of @xmath1 logical qubits , using both error correction schemes . the controlled - not gate realized by monroe _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in a paul trap , has a duration of @xmath138s , however it only operates on the qubits of a single ion and the associated vibrational mode .",
    "this accounts for approximately half of the laser pulses required to operate on two ions , since the state of the vibrational mode is not transferred to the second ion .",
    "the switching rate of the laser pulses implementing this logic gate is bounded by the characteristic vibrational frequency in the paul trap ( @xmath139100mhz ) .",
    "we expect that in the first experimental realizations using a linear rf trap , the duration of a controlled - not gate between two ions will be greater than that obtained in a paul trap , since the vibrational frequency will be of the order of only 10 - 100 khz , however a value of @xmath140s seems feasible eventually .",
    "the time taken to realize a qubit rotation is inversely proportional to the rabi frequency of the applied laser pulse . in the same article referred to above , monroe _",
    "_  report that the rabi frequency of the carrier pulses was 140khz , which results in interaction times of approximately @xmath141s and @xmath142s , for @xmath143 and @xmath127-pulses respectively .",
    "the interaction times necessary to implement both qubit rotations and controlled - not gates , are expected to be reduced in future experiments as the laser power available is increased .",
    "however the maximum laser intensity is limited because at high intensities the two - level approximation and the rotating wave approximations will break down .",
    "the feedback time for the error - correcting code using complementary electronic number states is proportional to the number of ions used , and is approximately given by @xmath144 .",
    "therefore the time required to implement 5 logical qubits ( using a 13-ion register ) is @xmath145s , which is still short compared to the decoherence time @xmath146s of the register ( assuming a qubit decoherence time @xmath147 minute ) , and ensures that spontaneous emission is unlikely to occur before the codeword is restored .    in comparison , the error - correcting code using fourier - transformed states only requires a constant time @xmath148s for its feedback process , though it requires a 21-ion register to implement 5 logical qubits .",
    "there are a number of problems which can affect the performance of our schemes including inefficient detection of spontaneous emission events , gate errors during the feedback process and decoherence due to vibrational damping while the ions are stored .",
    "we have assumed that these problems will be manageable in future experiments by some combination of technical accuracy and error - correcting codes , in order to focus on how the errors due to a single fundamental source of decoherence can be corrected .",
    "for example , the continuous monitoring of spontaneous emission over a @xmath149 solid angle can not be realized efficiently with present technology since the photodetection efficiency is very small ( @xmath150 ) , and it is very difficult to cover the entire angle with detectors .",
    "the implementation of two - qubit logic gates in the feedback , encoding and decoding processes was also assumed to be perfect , but could be realized by making use of the fault - tolerant controlled - not gates proposed by cirac , pellizzari and zoller @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed two quantum error correction schemes which rely on continuous monitoring of spontaneous emission and selective coherent feedback to eliminate memory errors as soon as they are detected .",
    "a minimum number of ancillary qubits are required to realize codewords , by using a fourier - transformed logical basis for the first scheme , and complementary electronic number states for the second scheme .",
