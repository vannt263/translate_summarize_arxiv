    "the only way by which the age of the sun can be estimated to a useful degree of precision is by accepting the basic tenets of solar - evolution theory and measuring those aspects of the structure of the sun that are predicted by the theory to be indicators of age .",
    "the structure measurements must be carried out seismologically , and evidently one expects greatest reliability of the results when all the available helioseismic data are employed . however , the most relevant modes are those of lowest degree , because it is they that penetrate most deeply into the energy - generating core where the relic helium - abundance variation records the integrated history of nuclear transmutation .",
    "moreover , it is also only they that can be measured in other stars .",
    "therefore , there has been some interest in calibrating theoretical stellar models using only low - degree modes .",
    "the prospect was first discussed in detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* christensen - dalsgaard ( 1984 , 88 ) ) , @xcite and @xcite , although prior to that it had already been pointed out that the helioseismic frequency data that were available at the time indicated that either the initial helium abundance @xmath2 or the age @xmath3 , or both , are somewhat greater than the generally accepted values ( * ? ? ? * ( gough 1983 ) ) , an inference which is consistent with our present findings .",
    "subsequent , more careful , calibrations were carried out by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and bonanno , schlattl & patern ( 2002 ) .",
    "not all of them addressed the influence of uncertainties in @xmath2 on the determination of @xmath3 .",
    "as a main - sequence star ages , helium is produced in the core , increasing the mean molecular mass @xmath4 , preferentially at the centre , and thereby reducing the sound speed .",
    "the resulting functional form of the sound speed @xmath5 depends not only on age @xmath3 but also on the relative augmentation of @xmath6 , which itself depends on the initial absolute value of @xmath4 , and hence on @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite tried to separate these two effects using the degree dependence of the small separation @xmath7 of cyclic frequencies @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is order and @xmath10 is degree .",
    "this is possible , in principle , because modes of different degree and similar frequency sample the core differently .",
    "however , that difference is subtle , and the sensitivity to the relatively fine distinction between the effects of @xmath3 and @xmath2 on the functional form of @xmath5 in the core is low .",
    "consequently the error in the calibration produced by errors in the observed frequency data is uncomfortably high .",
    "this lack of sensitivity can be overcome by using , in addition to core - sensitive seismic signatures , the relatively small oscillatory component of the eigenfrequencies induced by the sound - speed glitch associated with helium ionization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( gough 2002 ) ) , whose amplitude is close to being proportional to helium abundance @xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( houdek & gough 2007a ) ) .",
    "the neglect of that component in the previously employed asymptotic signature @xmath12 had not only omitted an important diagnostic of @xmath11 but had also imprinted an oscillatory contamination in the calibration as the limits @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , of the adopted mode range was varied ( * ? ? ? * ( gough 2001 ) ) .",
    "it therefore behoves us to decontaminate the core signature from glitch contributions produced in the outer layers of the star ( from both helium ionization and the abrupt variation at the base of the convection zone , and also from hydrogen ionization and the superadiabatic convective boundary layer immediately beneath the photosphere ) . to this end",
    "a helioseismic glitch signature has been developed by @xcite , from which frequency contributions @xmath15 can be computed and subtracted from the raw frequencies @xmath8 to produce effective glitch - free frequencies @xmath16 to which a glitch - free asymptotic formula ( [ eq : asymp ] ) can be fitted .",
    "the solar calibration is then accomplished by interpolating the theoretical seismic signatures computed on a grid of solar models to the observations , using a standard grid to compute derivatives with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and a carefully computed reference solar model designed to be close to the sun .",
    "the result of the first preliminary calibration by this method , using bison data , has been reported by @xcite . here",
    "we enlarge on our discussion of the analysis , and we augment our results with a calibration based on a second reference solar model .",
    ", of low - degree solar frequencies from bison .",
    "top right : the symbols are second differences @xmath17 of adiabatic pulsation eigenfrequencies of solar model s of @xcite .",
    "the solid curves in both panels are the diagnostics ( [ eq : delnu ] )  ( [ eq : secdiff ] ) , whose eleven parameters have been adjusted to fit the data optimally .",
    "bottom : the symbols denote contributions @xmath18 to the frequencies produced by the acoustic glitches of the sun ( left panel ) and model s ( right panel ) . ]",
    "any abrupt variation in the stratification of a star ( relative to the scale of the inverse radial wavenumber of a seismic mode of oscillation ) , which here we call an acoustic glitch , induces an oscillatory component in the spacing of the cyclic eigenfrequencies of seismic modes .",
    "our interest is principally in the glitch caused by the depression in the first adiabatic exponent @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are pressure , density and specific entropy ) caused by helium ionization , which imparts a glitch in the sound speed @xmath5 . the deviation @xmath23 where @xmath24 , of the eigenfrequency @xmath25 from the corresponding frequency @xmath26 of a similar smoothly stratified star is the indicator of @xmath11 that we use in conjunction with the indicators of core structure to determine the main - sequence age .",
    "approximate expressions for the frequency contributions @xmath27 arising from acoustic glitches in solar - type stars were recently presented by @xcite .",
    "here we improve them by adopting the appropriate airy functions ai@xmath28 that are used as comparison functions in the jwkb approximations to the oscillation eigenfunctions , as did @xcite .",
    "the complete expression for @xmath27 is then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30\\cr & & \\hspace{-8pt } \\times\\bigl[\\tilde\\mu\\tilde\\beta\\int_0^t\\kappa^{-1}_{\\rm i } { \\rm e}^{-(\\tau-\\tilde\\eta\\tau_{\\rm ii})^2/2\\tilde\\mu^2\\delta^2_{\\rm ii}}|x|^{1/2 }    & & \\;\\;+\\;\\int_0^t\\kappa^{-1}_{\\rm ii } { \\rm e}^{-(\\tau-\\tau_{\\rm ii})^2/2\\delta^2_{\\rm ii}}|x|^{1/2 }    \\label{eq : delgamnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] arises from the variation in @xmath31 induced by helium ionization , and @xmath32        \\!-\\!(16\\pi^2\\tilde{\\tau}_{\\rm c}^2\\nu^2\\!+\\!1)^{1/2 } \\right\\}\\ ,   \\label{eq : delcnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] arises from the acoustic glitch at the base of the convection zone resulting from a near discontinuity ( a true discontinuity in theoretical models using local mixing - length theory with a non - zero mixing length at the lower boundary of the convection zone ) in the second derivative of density .",
    "here , @xmath33 is a constant , being a representative polytropic index in the expression for the approximate effective phase @xmath34 appearing in the argument of the airy function , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants of order unity which account for the relation between the acoustic glitches caused by the first and second stages of ionization of helium ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath26 , derived from equation ( [ eq : nudiff ] ) , of both the solar observations and the eigenfrequencies of the reference solar model , is fitted the asymptotic expression @xmath71 by minimizing @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and c@xmath74 is the covariance matrix of the observational errors in @xmath26 , from which we obtain both the coefficients @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and the covariance matrix @xmath77 of the errors .",
    "following @xcite , we carry out this fitting in the frequency range given by @xmath78 , where @xmath14 and @xmath79 , and we vary @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "each of the parameters @xmath82 represents an integral of a function of the equilibrium stratification .",
    "the integrals @xmath83 and @xmath84 are of particular importance to our analysis , because @xmath85 and @xmath84 are dominated by conditions in the core , and , although the contributions to @xmath86 from the core and the rest of the star are roughly equal in magnitude ( and potentially have opposite signs ) , the latter is relatively insensitive to @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the integrands in the remaining integrals are either more evenly distributed throughout the sun or are concentrated near the surface .",
    "we have carried out age calibrations using combinations of the parameters @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a measure of the maximum depression in @xmath31 in the second helium ionization zone .",
    "presuming , as is normal , that the reference model is parametrically close to the sun , we consider the reference value @xmath89 to be approximated by a two - term taylor expansion of @xmath90 about the value @xmath91 of the sun : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the deviations of age @xmath3 and initial heavy - element abundance @xmath95 from the reference model , and @xmath96 are the formal errors in the calibration parameters whose covariance matrix @xmath97 can be derived from @xmath77 and @xmath69 .",
    "a ( parametrically local ) maximum - likelihood fit then leads to the following set of linear equations : @xmath98 in which @xmath99 , @xmath100 , is the solution vector subject to ( correlated ) errors @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and the partial derivatives @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 .",
    "a similar set of equations is obtained for the formal errors @xmath101 : @xmath105 from which the error covariance matrix @xmath106 can be computed from @xmath97 .",
    "the partial derivatives @xmath107 were obtained from the two sets of five calibrated evolutionary models for the sun that were used in a similar calibration by @xcite , computed with the evolutionary programme by @xcite , and adopting the livermoore equation of state and the opal92 opacities .",
    "one set of models has a constant value for the heavy - element abundance @xmath108 but varying age ; the other has constant age but varying @xmath95 .",
    "note that , for prescribed relative abundances of heavy elements , the condition that the luminosity and radius of the sun agree with observation defines a functional relation between @xmath109 and @xmath3 .",
    "the values of the partial derivatives @xmath107 are listed in table1 .",
    ".partial derivatives @xmath107 obtained from two sets of calibrated evolutionary models for the sun .",
    "values with respect to age @xmath3 are in units of gy@xmath110 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to illustrate the effect of taking @xmath27 into account , we compare in figure2 a first assessment of @xmath111 using the glitch - free frequencies @xmath26 ( left panel ) with that obtained from the raw frequencies @xmath112 ( right panel ) .",
    "recall that @xmath86 represents a functional of the equilibrium structure of the star , and should not vary with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the range of values for @xmath86 is the lower for @xmath26 , as we had anticipated .",
    "we believe that the upturn of @xmath86 for low values of @xmath80 in the left panel of the figure is a result of the failure of the asymptotic formula ( [ eq : delnu])([eq : delcnu ] ) when @xmath25 is low .",
    "the dipping of @xmath86 at high values of @xmath80 and low values of @xmath81 occurs because the frequency range is too small for a reliable determination of the fitting coefficients @xmath82 .",
    "we therefore adopt intermediate values for @xmath80 and high values for @xmath81 , for which @xmath86 is insensitive to the selected frequency range .",
    "( see equation [ eq : asymp ] ) as functions of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "results are shown for fitting ( [ eq : asymp ] ) to the glitch - free frequencies @xmath26 ( left panel ) and to the raw frequencies @xmath25 ( right panel ) . ]",
    "age calibrations using different combinations of the parameters @xmath90 and two different reference models are summarized in table2 .",
    "the younger reference model is ` model s ' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( christensen - dalsgaard et al . 1996 ) ) which has age @xmath113gy ; the second is ` model t ' , which has age @xmath114gy .",
    "the same physics was adopted in the evolutionary calculations of both models .",
    "we notice in table2 that the calibration for the combination @xmath115 , i.e. without @xmath116 , is less stable to a change in the reference model than are the calibrations with combinations in which @xmath116 is included , and therefore is less reliable , as we have explained in the introduction .",
    "if we ignore in table2 the results for @xmath115 and combine the others , we obtain      including the calibrations with @xmath115 does not change the outcome . error contours corresponding to the calibration from model s in the first row of table2 are plotted in figure3 .",
    "corresponding contours for model t are the same , except that their centres are displaced to ( 4.677gy , 0.0170 ) .",
    "one can adduce from our description of the analysis in section2 that our current treatment of the errors is not completely unbiassed ; however , the potential bias is of the order of only @xmath119 , which is small .",
    "the age we have found is greater than currently accepted values .",
    "the values of @xmath95 are somewhat smaller than those of models s and t ( 0.01963 ) , but we hasten to point out that they should not be regarded strictly as statements about the initial heavy - element abundance , but rather as measures of the opacity in the radiative interior .",
    "@xcite have argued that the photospheric abundances of c , n and o had previously been overestimated , suggesting that the actual total heavy - element abundance is even lower than had previously been believed .",
    "however , that can not imply that the opacity in the solar interior is necessarily comparably lower because it has been implicitly calibrated here ( by accepting the tenets of solar - evolution theory , and the opal opacity calculations upon which the models are based ) , and indeed the opacity has already been determined seismologically from a broader spectrum of modes than has been adopted here ( ( * ? ? ? * gough 2004 ) ) . the matter raised by asplund etal .",
    "therefore challenges either the opacity calculations , the nuclear reaction rates , or the basic physics of stellar evolution , not helioseismology as some spectators have surmised .",
    "as we know already from seismological structure inversions , the solar models are not accurate by helioseismological standards .",
    "therefore the properties inferred from these calibrations could be more contaminated by systematic error than by errors in the observed frequencies .",
