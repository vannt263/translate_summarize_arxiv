    "thanks to recent progress in microfabrication and measurement techniques , it is possible to study the properties of superconducting samples with sizes comparable to the penetration depth @xmath0  and the coherence length @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of these mesoscopic systems are considerably influenced by confinement effects .",
    "therefore , the vortex state will depend on the size and the geometry of the sample .",
    "in the present paper , we study the properties and the vortex states of superconducting thin disks with a hole . in the past ,",
    "two limiting cases were studied : the thin - wire loop and the disk without a hole . in 1962",
    "little and parks studied a thin - wire loop in an axial magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 phase diagram showed a periodic component . each time a flux quantum @xmath3 penetrates the system , @xmath4 exhibits an oscillation .",
    "berger and rubinstein @xcite studied mesoscopic superconducting loops using the non - linear ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory .",
    "they assumed that the induced magnetic field can be neglected for samples with sufficiently small thickness . in the limit of thin loops ,",
    "the transition between states with different angular momentum @xmath5 ( also called vorticity ) occurs when the enclosed flux @xmath6 equals @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the superconducting disk was studied by schweigert _",
    "et al _ @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) by solving the two gl equations self - consistently .",
    "although the gl equations were derived to describe superconductivity near the critical point , this theory turns out to be valid over a much broader range of magnetic field and temperature @xcite .",
    "they found that the finite thickness of the disk influences the magnetic field profile , i.e. the magnetic pressure , and this changes the size of the meissner effect which is different from the well - studied cylinder geometries @xcite .",
    "the reverse problem , i.e. the anti - dot , was studied by bezryadin _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they obtained a phase diagram of a thin superconducting film with a circular hole in an axial magnetic field by solving numerically the nonlinear gl equations in the limit of a thin film . here",
    "we generalize the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to a thin circular superconducting disk containing a circular hole .",
    "the intermediate case of finite width loops was studied previously by bardeen @xcite within the london theory .",
    "he showed that in tubes of very small diameter and with wall thickness of the order of the penetration depth the flux through the tube is quantized in units of @xmath8 where @xmath9 depends on the dimensions of the system .",
    "arutunyan and zharkov @xcite found that the flux through the effective area @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 where the effective radius @xmath12 is approximately equal to the geometric mean square of the inner radius @xmath13 and the outer radius @xmath14 of the cylinder ; i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "recently , fomin _ et al _ @xcite _  _ studied square loops with leads attached to it and found inhomogeneous cooper pair distributions in the loop with enhancements near the corners of the square loop .",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated infinitely thin loops of finite width . in this case , the magnetic field induced by the supercurrents can be neglected and the total magnetic field equals the external applied magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , they used the linearized gl equation which is only valid near the superconductor / normal boundary where the density of the superconducting condensate @xmath16 is small . only the giant vortex state with a definite angular momentum @xmath5 was studied and they concentrated on the two- ( 2d ) to three - dimensional ( 3d ) crossover .",
    "berger and rubinstein @xcite also studied infinitely thin loops of finite width using the non - linear gl theory and they also neglected the induced field .    it is well known that for type - ii @xmath17 superconductors the triangular abrikosov vortex lattice is energetically favored in the range @xmath18 . since the effective london penetration depth @xmath19 increases considerably in thin samples and for @xmath20 one would expect the appearance of the abrikosov multi - vortex state even in thin rings made with a material with @xmath21 similar as for the case of a thin disk @xcite",
    ", we expect that the structure of a finite number of vortices should differ from a simple triangular arrangement in the case of a thin ring and we expect that they will resemble the configurations found for coulomb clusters which are confined into a ring @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider circular flat disks of non - zero width with a circular hole in it , which is not necessary in the center of the disk .",
    "the superconducting properties are also studied deep inside the superconducting state where : i ) nonlinear effects are important , i.e. @xmath22 is not necessarily small , and the nonlinear gl equations have to be solved , ii ) the total magnetic field is not homogeneous , i.e. it is spatial varying due to the meissner effect and the flux quantization condition which may enhance or diminish the magnetic field through the hole as compared to the applied magnetic field , and iii ) due to nonlinear effects the circular symmetric giant vortex states are not necessarily the lowest energy states and the magnetic field can penetrate the superconductor through single vortices creating a multi - vortex state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the theoretical model . in section",
    "iii we consider a small superconducting disk with a hole in the center . in this case",
    "we find that only the giant vortex state appears .",
    "we study the influence of the radius of the hole on the superconducting state .",
    "for such a small system the relation between the local magnetic field , the current density and the cooper pair density is investigated and the quantization of the flux through the hole is investigated .",
    "next , in section iv , we consider the case of a larger superconducting disk with a hole in the center . for increasing magnetic field ,",
    "we find re - entrant behaviour ; i.e. transition from the giant vortex state to the multi - vortex state and back to the giant vortex state before superconductivity is destroyed .",
    "finally , in section v , we investigate the influence of the position of the hole on the vortex configuration ; i.e. what happens if we break the axial symmetry ? our results are summarized in section vi .",
    "in the present paper , we consider superconducting disks with radius @xmath23 and thickness @xmath24 with a hole inside with radius @xmath13 which is placed a distance @xmath25 away from the center of the disk ( fig .",
    "[ conf ] ) .",
    "these superconducting ` rings ' are immersed in an insulating medium with a perpendicular uniform magnetic field @xmath26 . to solve this problem",
    "we follow the numerical approach of schweigert and peeters @xcite . for thin disks",
    "@xmath27 they found that it is allowed to average the gl equations over the disk thickness . using dimensionless variables and the london gauge @xmath28 for the vector potential @xmath29 , we write the system of gl equations in the following form @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of superconducting current .",
    "the superconducting wavefunction satisfies the following boundary conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 far away from the superconductor . here",
    "the distance is measured in units of the coherence length @xmath35 , the vector potential in @xmath36 _ h-.2em.2em_@xmath37 , and the magnetic field in @xmath38 _ h-.2em.2em_@xmath39 .",
    "the ring is placed in the plane @xmath40 the external magnetic field is directed along the @xmath41-axis , and the indices @xmath42 , @xmath43 refer to two- and three - dimensional operators , respectively .    the giant vortex state in a circular configuration is characterized by the total angular momentum @xmath5 through @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath6 are the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "@xmath5 is the winding number and gives the vorticity of the system .",
    "an arbitrary superconducting state is generally a mixture of different angular harmonics @xmath46 due to the non - linearity of the gl equations .",
    "nevertheless , we can introduce an analog to the total angular momentum @xmath5  which is still a good quantum number and which is in fact nothing else then the number of vortices in the system .    to solve the system of eqs.([lijn1]-[lijn2 ] ) , we generalized the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite for disks to our fat ring configuration .",
    "we apply a finite - difference representation of the order parameter and the vector potential on a uniform cartesian space grid ( x , y ) , with typically 128 grid points over a distance @xmath47 ( i.e. the diameter of the ring ) , and use the link variable approach @xcite , and an iteration procedure based on the gauss - seidel technique to find @xmath48 .",
    "the vector potential is obtained with the fast fourier transform technique where we set @xmath49 at the boundary of a larger space grid @xmath50 .    to find the different vortex configurations , which include the metastable states , we search for the steady - state solutions of eqs.([lijn1]-[lijn2 ] ) starting from different randomly generated initial conditions .",
    "then we increase / decrease slowly the magnetic field and recalculate each time the exact vortex structure .",
    "we do this for each vortex configuration in a magnetic field range where the number of vortices stays the same . by comparing the dimensionless gibbs free energies of the different vortex configurations @xmath51",
    "d% \\overrightarrow{r } ,   \\eqnum{5}\\ ] ] where integration is performed over the sample volume @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the vector potential of the uniform magnetic field , we find the ground state .",
    "the dimensionless magnetization , which is a direct measure of the expelled magnetic field from the sample , is defined as @xmath54 where @xmath26 is the applied magnetic field .",
    "@xmath55 is the magnetic field averaged over the sample or detector surface area @xmath56 .",
    "first we discuss a small superconducting ring . although the system is circular symmetric in general , we are not allowed to assume that @xmath57 because of the nonlinear term in the gl - equations ( [ lijn1]-[lijn2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we found that for sufficiently small rings the confinement effects are dominant and this imposes a circular symmetry on the superconducting condensate .",
    "if we can assume axial symmetry , the dimensions of the gl equations will be reduced and thus the accuracy and the computation time will be improved .",
    "therefore we will use this method for small rings . for a disk ,",
    "this kind of solution with fixed @xmath5 has been called @xmath58 _",
    "solution _ by deo _",
    "et al _ @xcite in contrast to the @xmath59 _",
    "solution _ of the general problem .",
    "the ground state free energy @xmath60 of a superconducting disk with radius @xmath61 and thickness @xmath62 and gl parameter @xmath63 is shown in fig .",
    "[ energy ] for a hole in the center with radius @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the situation with @xmath68 corresponds to the situation of a superconducting disk without a hole which was already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . with increasing hole radius @xmath13",
    ", we find that the superconducting / normal transition ( this is the magnetic field where the free energy equals zero ) shifts appreciably to higher magnetic fields and more transitions between different @xmath5-states are possible before superconductivity disappears .",
    "furthermore , the thin dotted curve gives the free energy for a thicker ring with thickness @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in comparison with the previous results for @xmath62 ,",
    "the free energy becomes more negative , but the transitions between the different @xmath5-states occur almost at the same magnetic fields . thus increasing the thickness of",
    "the ring increases superconductivity which is a consequence of the smaller penetration of the magnetic field into the superconductor .",
    "experimentally , using magnetization measurements one can investigate the effect of the geometry and the size of the sample on the superconducting state .",
    "one of the main advantages of these measurements , in comparison with resistivity measurements , is that they are non invasive and no conduction probes are needed which may distort the superconducting state . to investigate the magnetization of a single superconducting disk geim _",
    "et al _ @xcite  used sub - micron hall probes .",
    "the hall cross acts like a magnetometer , where in the ballistic regime  the hall voltage is determined by the average magnetic field through the hall cross region @xcite .",
    "hence , by measuring the hall resistance , one obtains the average magnetic field , and consequently , the magnetic field expelled from the hall cross ( eq .",
    "( [ magnform ] ) ) ,  which is a measure for the  magnetization of the superconductor @xcite . as in the case of a superconducting disk @xcite ,",
    "the field distribution in the case of thin superconducting rings is extremely non - uniform inside as well as outside the sample and therefore the detector size will have an effect on the measured magnetization . to understand this effect of the detector",
    ", we calculate the magnetization for a superconducting ring with outer radius @xmath71 thickness @xmath72 and two values of the inner radius @xmath73 and @xmath74 by averaging the magnetic field ( see eq .",
    "( [ magnform ] ) ) over several detector sizes @xmath56 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ magnetization](a , b ) as a function of the applied magnetic field for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the solid curve ( curve ( i ) ) shows the calculated magnetization if we average the magnetic field over the superconducting volume , and curve ( ii ) is the magnetization after averaging the field over a circular area with radius @xmath23 , i.e. superconductor and hole .",
    "notice that in the meissner regime , i.e. @xmath77 where @xmath78 the magnetization of superconductor + hole is larger than the one of the superconductor alone which is due to flux expulsion from the hole . for @xmath79",
    "the reverse is true because now flux is trapped in the hole .",
    "experimentally , one usually averages the magnetic field over a square hall cross region .",
    "therefore , we calculated the magnetization by averaging the magnetic field over a square region ( curve(iii ) )  with width equal to @xmath80 i.e. the diameter of the ring . curve ( iv ) shows the magnetization if the sides of the square detector are equal to @xmath81 . increasing the size of the detector , decreases the observed magnetization because the magnetic field is averaged over a larger region which brings @xmath55 closer to the applied field @xmath26    having the free energies of the different giant vortex configurations for several values of the hole radius varying from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , we construct an equilibrium vortex phase diagram .",
    "[ phaseri ] shows this phase diagram for a superconducting disk with radius @xmath61 , thickness @xmath62 and for @xmath63 .",
    "the solid curves indicate where the ground state of the free energy changes from one @xmath84-state to another and the thick solid curve gives the superconducting / normal transition .",
    "the latter exhibits a small oscillatory behavior which is a consequence of the little - parks effect .",
    "notice that the superconducting / normal transition is moving to larger fields with increasing hole radius @xmath13 and more and more flux can be trapped . in the limit @xmath85",
    ", the critical magnetic field is infinite and there are an infinite number of @xmath5-states possible which is a consequence of the enhancement of surface conductivity for very small samples @xcite .",
    "because of the finite grid , we were not able to obtain accurate results for @xmath86 .",
    "the dashed lines connect our results for hole radius @xmath87 with the results for @xmath85 @xcite , where the transitions between the different @xmath5-states occur when the enclosed flux is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the elementary flux quantum .",
    "notice that for rings of non zero width , i.e. @xmath90 the @xmath91 transition occurs at higher magnetic field than predicted from the condition @xmath88 .",
    "the discrepancy increases with increasing width of the ring and with increasing @xmath5 . starting from @xmath92 we find that with increasing @xmath13 the meissner state disappears at smaller @xmath93 the hole in the center of the disk allows for a larger penetration of the magnetic field which favors the @xmath94 state .",
    "this is the reason why the @xmath95 transition moves to a lower external field while the @xmath96 transition initially occurs for larger @xmath26 with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "when the hole size becomes of the order of the width of one vortex the @xmath97 transition starts to move to lower fields and the @xmath98 state becomes more favorable .",
    "the effect of the thickness of the ring on the phase diagram is investigated in fig .",
    "[ phased ] .",
    "the thin solid curves indicate where the ground state of the free energy changes from one @xmath5-state to another one , while the thick curve gives the superconducting / normal transition .",
    "notice that the transition from the @xmath99 to the @xmath94 state and the superconducting / normal transition depends weakly on the thickness of the ring .",
    "for increasing thickness @xmath100 the @xmath98 state becomes less favorable and disappears for @xmath101 in this case , there is a transition from the @xmath94 state directly to the normal state . increasing @xmath24 stabilizes the different @xmath5-states up to larger magnetic fields .",
    "this is due to the increased expulsion of the applied field from the superconducting ring @xcite .    in the next step ,",
    "we investigate three very important and mutually dependent quantities : the local magnetic field @xmath102 , the cooper pair density @xmath103 and the current density @xmath104 .",
    "we will discuss these quantities as a function of the radial position @xmath105 for this study we distinguish two situations , i.e. @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the first case the sample behaves more like a superconducting disk , and in the second case like a superconducting loop .",
    "first , we consider a superconducting disk with radius @xmath108 and thickness @xmath69 with a hole with radius @xmath73 in the center . the free energy and the magnetization ( after averaging over the superconductor+hole ) for such a ring are shown in fig .  [ enr05 ] .",
    "the dashed curves give the free energy and the magnetization for the different @xmath109-states , and the solid curve is the result  for the ground state .",

    "[ enr05](a , b ) .    for low magnetic field ,",
    "the system is in the @xmath99 state , i.e. the meissner state , and the flux trapped in the hole is considerably suppressed .",
    "hence , the local magnetic field inside the hole is lower than the external applied magnetic field as is shown in fig .  [ magnr05](a ) by curves 1 and 2 .",
    "please  notice that the plotted magnetic field is scaled by the applied field @xmath26 .",
    "in the @xmath99 state the superconductor expels the magnetic field by inducing a supercurrent which tries to compensate the applied magnetic field in the superconductor and inside the hole .",
    "this is called the diamagnetic meissner effect .",
    "as long as @xmath5 equals zero , the induced current has only to compensate the magnetic field at the outside of the ring and , therefore , the current flows in the whole superconducting material in the same direction and the size increases with increasing field .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .  [ magnr05](e ) by curves 1 and 2 where the current density @xmath112 becomes more negative for increasing @xmath113 .",
    "notice also that the current density is more negative at the outside than at the inside of the superconducting ring which leads to a stronger depression of the cooper pair density at the outer edge as compared to the inner edge of the ring ( see curves 1 and 2 in fig .  [ magnr05](c ) ) .    at @xmath114 , the ground state changes from the @xmath99 to the @xmath94 state ( see fig .",
    "[ enr05](a ) ) .",
    "suddenly more flux becomes trapped in the hole ( compare curve 1 with curve 3 in fig .",
    "[ magnr05](a ) ) , the local magnetic field inside the hole increases and becomes larger than the external magnetic field @xmath26 . in the @xmath94 state ,",
    "there is a sharp peak in the magnetic field  at the inner boundary because of demagnetization effects .",
    "consequently , more current is needed to compensate the magnetic field near the inner boundary than near the outer boundary ( see curve 3 in fig .",
    "[ magnr05](e ) ) .",
    "the sign of the current near the inner boundary becomes positive ( the current direction reverses ) , but the sign of the current near the outer boundary does not change .",
    "this can be explained as follows : near the inner boundary @xmath115 the magnetic field is compressed into the hole ( paramagnetic effect ) , while near the outer boundary @xmath116 the magnetic field is expelled to the insulating environment ( diamagnetic effect ) .",
    "the sign reversal of @xmath104 occurs at @xmath117 and later we will show that the flux through the circular area with radius @xmath12 is exactly quantized . at the @xmath99 to the @xmath94 transition the maximum in the cooper pair density ( compare curves 1 and 3 in fig .  [ magnr05](c ) ) shifts from @xmath118 to @xmath119 . further increasing the external field increases the cooper pair density near the inner boundary",
    "initially ( compare curve 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ magnr05](c ) ) , because the flux in the hole has to be compressed less . the point @xmath12 , where @xmath120 , shifts towards the inner boundary of the ring .",
    "further increasing the external magnetic field , the cooper pair density starts to decrease ( see curves 5 and 6 in fig .",

    "[ magnr05](b ) ) , and near the outer boundary @xmath104 becomes less negative which shields the magnetic field from the superconductor+hole .",

    "the ground state changes from the @xmath94 state to the @xmath98 state and extra flux is trapped in the hole .",
