    "superclusters are complex structures , consisting of multiple galaxy clusters and groups connected by chains of galaxies",
    ". they can reach sizes of @xmath6 mpc , making them the largest structures in the universe .",
    "as such , they can be used to provide an estimate of the baryonic mass fraction @xmath7 . their frequency and topology may be used to test the veracity of large scale cosmological simulations . because they contain structures spanning a wide range of projected and local densities , superclusters are ideal sites for studying the variety of physical processes affecting galaxy evolution , including ram pressure stripping , mergers , tidal encounters , harassment , etc .",
    "they are also sites of cluster - cluster interactions , allowing us to probe how cluster - scale interactions effect their constituent galaxies , and to probe possible differences between the dark and baryonic matter distributions .",
    "recent deep , wide - field imaging campaigns have begun to reveal an increasing number of superclusters at @xmath8 .",
    "these include a @xmath0 compact supercluster found in the red - sequence cluster survey @xcite , a structure at @xmath9 in the uk infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) deep extragalactic survey @xcite , and a large galaxy density enhancement at @xmath10 in the cosmos field @xcite . to increase the number of well - studied high - redshift structures , we have begun the observations of redshift evolution in large scale environments ( orelse ) survey , a systematic photometric and spectroscopic search for structure on scales @xmath11 mpc around 20 known clusters at @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter orelse i ) .",
    "the cl 1604 supercluster at @xmath13 was the first supercluster detected as part of this survey and remains the most heavily studied structure at these redshifts .",
    "it was initially discovered as two separate clusters in the plate - based survey of @xcite , with redshifts and preliminary velocity dispersions measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p98 and p01 ) .",
    "deeper ccd imaging @xcite revealed a total of four distinct galaxy density peaks in a contiguous area of @xmath14 . a large spectrographic survey using the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; * ? ? ? * ) and the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck 10-m telescopes confirmed the new cluster candidates and provided improved velocity dispersions for all four supercluster components using 230 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the large radial depth of the supercluster ( @xmath15 mpc ) in comparison to the small imaging area ( @xmath16 mpc ) spurred a wide field imaging campaign using the large format camera ( lfc ; * ? ? ? * ) on the palomar 5-m telescope .",
    "four additional red ( @xmath17 ) galaxy overdensities , identified as candidate clusters , were detected in the larger area , bringing to eight the total number of possible clusters in this structure @xcite .",
    "additional multi - object spectroscopy was undertaken to confirm the new cluster candidates and improve our understanding of the supercluster structure . in this paper",
    "we utilize our complete spectroscopic data set , with @xmath18 extragalactic redshifts , to examine the three dimensional structure of the cl1604 supercluster , improve our cluster detection algorithm , and study the cluster galaxy populations .",
    "a total of 427 galaxies have been spectroscopically confirmed within the structure , nearly doubling the number of known members .",
    "the only comparable structures at similar redshift are the @xmath9 ukidss supercluster with five density peaks @xcite and the @xmath0 three - cluster system described in @xcite .",
    "these two systems each have only @xmath19 spectroscopic members .",
    "we show that even with hundreds of members spread over the supercluster , it remains difficult to obtain consistent velocity dispersions due to the presence of overlapping structures , filaments , and changes in galaxy populations between clusters .",
    "section 2 describes the photometric data , density mapping and cluster detection , all of which are improvements on our earlier work .",
    "the spectroscopic data is described in  3 .",
    "cluster velocity dispersions and the associated measurement complications , along with the overall structure of the supercluster , are discussed in  4 .",
    "we utilize our extensive spectroscopic sample to study photometric selection of cluster members using only three filters ( @xmath20 ) , and the cluster properties .",
    "section 5 details the various fore- and background structures , including two serendipitously discovered structures at @xmath21 and an apparent wall at @xmath22 . a brief discussion of implications for optical surveys of high - redshift galaxy clusters and spectroscopic studies of cluster galaxy populations ,",
    "is presented in  6 . throughout the paper",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath23 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the imaging data are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we provide a brief review , along with a description of improvements to the photometric calibration and modifications made to the final density map since those publications .",
    "we have also implemented a technique to estimate the contamination of our cluster catalog by false detections , described in  2.4 .",
    "the photometric data are a combination of two pointings taken in cousins @xmath27 and gunn @xmath28 with the carnegie observatories spectroscopic multislit and imaging camera ( cosmic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and two pointings in sloan @xmath29,@xmath30 and @xmath31 with the lfc , both on the palomar 5-m telescope .",
    "the layout of the imaging fields is shown in figure 1 of @xcite , who also describe the lfc observations and data reduction .",
    "the details of the cosmic observations and data reduction are described in @xcite .",
    "since the publication of @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has released data in the fields covered by these pointings .",
    "we have used this data to improve the transformation of the cosmic @xmath27 and @xmath28 magnitudes to the sdss system and to calibrate the lfc fields .",
    "the sdss dr5 @xcite was queried for the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 model magnitudes in the region covered by our imaging .",
    "objects were cross - identified between the sdss catalog and our four separate pointings ( two cosmic and two lfc ) .",
    "the scatter between our coordinates and those of sdss were @xmath32 in both right ascension and declination , commensurate with the expected astrometric errors .",
    "transformations from our photometry to sdss were derived independently for each filter and pointing .",
    "the cosmic @xmath27 and @xmath28 magnitudes were converted to the sdss system using equations of the form @xmath33 for objects detected in only one band , we assumed @xmath34 , the median color of sources in the cosmic catalog .",
    "similarly , the lfc data are recalibrated using @xmath35    the depths of the lfc images are such that any object with normal colors will be detected in all three bands , unless it as the field edges or near a saturated star .",
    "we therefore apply no color terms to single - band detections .",
    "there is significant overlap between the two lfc pointings , and especially the cosmic and lfc pointings . in our previous work",
    ", we simply trimmed the catalogs to non - overlapping areas based on visually selected coordinate limits . here , we have improved the catalog combination by selecting objects based on photometric errors . first , the two lfc pointings were compared to each other . for sources appearing in both pointings ,",
    "we use the detection with the lowest average photometric error in the three filters to create a master lfc catalog .",
    "the same procedure is applied to the two cosmic catalogs to generate a single cosmic catalog .",
    "these two catalogs are then compared on the basis of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 errors , with objects selected from lfc if the average photometric error @xmath36 from lfc is less than that from cosmic plus 0.05 mag .",
    "this scheme gives preference to data from the lfc because it covers a larger area and includes photometry in @xmath31 . for sources where cosmic @xmath29 and @xmath30 photometry is chosen ,",
    "we incorporate @xmath31 data if it is available from lfc , or from sdss if there is no lfc @xmath31 data or the lfc @xmath31 detection is flagged as bad .",
    "the final hybrid catalog is corrected for galactic reddening using the dust maps from @xcite on an object - by - object basis .",
    "the @xmath37 limiting magnitudes are 25.2 , 24.8 , and 23.3 in @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we produce a galaxy density map by adaptively smoothing a color - selected subset of galaxies in the cl1604 field . with the additional spectroscopy presented in @xcite and the improved photometric calibration discussed above , some modifications to the density mapping algorithm were made .",
    "first , we used the observed colors of @xmath38 confirmed members to choose intervals in both the @xmath39 and @xmath40 colors that provided large numbers of supercluster galaxies and enhanced contrast relative to fore- and background structures .",
    "the limiting colors and magnitudes used were @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these color cuts are delineated by the black rectangles in the color - magnitude and color - color diagrams in figure  [ cmds ] .",
    "we also examined the possibility of applying color cuts based on stellar population synthesis models .",
    "synthetic galaxy spectra were generated following the prescription used by the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a @xcite model parameterized as a 0.1 gyr burst ending at @xmath44 followed by a @xmath45 gyr exponential decline .",
    "this model predicts colors of @xmath46 and @xmath47 at @xmath0 ; they are plotted as the yellow bars and crosses in figure  [ cmds ] .",
    "the observed @xmath48 colors are about 0.2mag redder . although the bc03 model colors are within our broad color cuts , the empirical colors , by construction , provide optimal detection of structure at the redshift of interest .",
    "tests of other models for the red galaxy population , including single starbursts with either instantaneous or exponentially declining bursts , showed that expected galaxy colors varied a few tenths of a magnitude between models .",
    "therefore , we use our empirically confirmed color cuts to produce a final density map .",
    "as discussed in orelse i , the star formation history chosen by the rcs yields model colors that , while within our broad color cuts , do not match perfectly the observed red sequences in any of our structures at @xmath49 .",
    "this is unsurprising as the average galaxy s star formation history varies with environment , and there remain unresolved issues with stellar population synthesis models . as models improve and large surveys like orelse , rcs and pisces ( panoramic imaging and spectroscopy of cluster evolution with subaru , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) obtain spectroscopy and map out the observed red sequence colors as a function of redshift , it will be possible to find bc models that better fit the data .",
    "the color and magnitude cuts select only 722 objects out of an initial catalog of @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "an adaptive kernel smoothing is applied using an initial window of @xmath52 mpc and 10 arcsecond pixels .",
    "we use a smaller kernel than the @xmath53 mpc radius applied in @xcite because our extensive spectroscopy showed that small groups were being blended into single detections in the density map .",
    "the smaller kernel also enhances the contrast of small groups against the background , making detection of such low - mass systems easier .",
    "the new density maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ akmap ] , with the detected overdensities marked .",
    "comparison to figure 1 of @xcite shows that similar structures are found with the new color cuts .",
    "the density maps are used primarily to provide a visual locator for intermediate density large scale structure in the imaging field .",
    "filaments and cluster infall regions can cover significant portions of the observed area , but at relatively low contrast , making it difficult to detect them and define their boundaries .",
    "identification of such overdense regions is used primarily to direct placement of follow - up observations , especially slitmasks for multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "however , it is necessary to provide a consistent detection mechanism for finding clusters and groups in the orelse survey fields , described below .",
    "cluster detection is performed by running sextractor @xcite on the adaptively smoothed red galaxy density map . in @xcite",
    "we relied on visual inspection of the density map and comparison to the poorest ( lowest velocity dispersion ) cluster in the field , cl1604 + 4316 ( cluster c ) . with the addition of the spectroscopy presented in @xcite and",
    "herein , the projected overdensities can be better characterized , and detection parameters tuned to detect real structures .",
    "we tested various combinations of detection threshold and minimum area , all taken from cluster c. this cluster still has the lowest reliably measured velocity dispersion , as detailed in  4 .",
    "sextractor was run with these parameters , and the resulting detections compared to our spectroscopic cluster catalog to ensure that all confirmed clusters and groups were detected .",
    "we also examined the false detection rate , described in the following section .",
    "the final set of detection parameters has high detection efficiency ( 100% by design ) for the confirmed structures while yielding less than one false detection on average in the survey area .",
    "a total of 10 cluster and group candidates are detected , similar to those found in @xcite .",
    "where possible , we use the same naming and lettering convention as our previous work to refer to specific clusters .",
    "table  [ candinfo ] provides the details of each cluster .",
    "column 1 lists the single letter denoting each cluster ( following the nomenclature of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while column 2 provides the full name .",
    "columns 3 and 4 give the updated cluster coordinates .",
    "the remaining columns provide information on membership , redshifts , and velocity dispersions , as detailed in  4 .      because one of our goals is the detection of low - mass group - like structures in the cl1604 field , our detection thresholds are generous in the sense that we may suffer from a high false detection rate , even with the stringent color cuts .",
    "our method for setting thresholds and estimating contamination rates is detailed in orelse i ; however we outline it briefly here since the cl1604 data have been used to tune the parameters .",
    "we use the noao deep wide field survey @xcite to study possible contamination by field galaxies having colors meeting our selection criteria .",
    "we can not rely on our imaging survey because it is entirely targeted at known high - density regions of the universe .",
    "thus , we use the noao dwfs to derive the statistical properties of the red galaxy distribution . the third data release ( dr3 ) in the bootes field",
    "covers an area of nine square degrees , in the b@xmath54 , r and i filters . in brief",
    ", we transform the dwfs @xmath27 and @xmath55 data to the sdss @xmath29 and @xmath30 systems , and apply our @xmath39 color cut and @xmath30 magnitude limit . because there is no @xmath31 photometry in the dwfs",
    ", we then assume that field galaxies meeting only the @xmath39 cut ( numbering @xmath56 ) have a similar projected distribution as those that also meet our @xmath40 cuts , only with a higher space density .",
    "we tested this assumption by examining the galaxy distributions far from cluster centers in density maps using our own data , applying only the @xmath39 cut and cuts in both colors .",
    "we find no significant differences .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we use the color- and magnitude - selected subset of the dwfs data to compute raleigh - levy ( rl ) parameters for galaxies meeting our color cuts , which we then use to generate simulated galaxy distributions .",
    "these are then used to produce density maps on which we run sextractor .",
    "the sextractor parameters detect_thresh and min_area ( @xmath57 ) are varied , using values of the galaxy density at different radii @xmath58 from the center of cluster c in cl1604 , until a set of values is found that successfully detects the confirmed clusters in cl1604 while yielding low contamination .",
    "we find that an area of 47 pix@xmath3 , corresponding to a radius of 0.3@xmath59 mpc , allows us to detect all of the spectroscopically confirmed cluster candidates in the real data , while minimizing the number of detections in the rl simulations , which should all be chance projections .",
    "the median number of false detections expected in the area imaged for cl1604 is @xmath60 , compared to the ten candidates detected .",
    "figure  [ rlfig ] shows an example rl simulated map @xmath61 on a side , with the eight false candidates detected using our optimal sextractor parameters marked .",
    "the shaded box in the bottom right covers an area equal to that imaged for cl1604 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations consist of five separate datasets :    1 .",
    "spectra taken using lris as part of the original @xcite survey .",
    "additional lris spectra taken in may 2000 , covering the area imaged with cosmic . 3 .",
    "deimos spectra covering the same area taken in 2003 .",
    "deimos spectra taken in 2005 and 2006 , using color selection and spanning a larger area imaged with lfc .",
    "deimos spectra covering the same area as before , but including x - ray , radio , hst acs and new color - selected sources .",
    "each sample is described in more detail below , with the layout of all masks shown in fig .",
    "[ masks ] .",
    "the original observations of cl1604 + 4304 and cl1604 + 4321 ( clusters a and d ) were taken in the late 1990s with lris on the keck i and ii telescopes and are detailed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these initial slitmasks targeted _ all _ galaxies with @xmath62 based on earlier imaging with lris .",
    "it is important to note that no color selection was utilized in selecting galaxies to observe ; therefore , blue galaxies at the supercluster redshift are more likely to be observed compared to the deimos data discussed below .",
    "redshifts were measured for 103 and 135 galaxies in the fields of cl1604 + 4304 and cl 1604 + 4321 , respectively .",
    "imaging of a larger region with cosmic on the palomar 200-inch telescope was used to design additional lris slitmasks , targeting an area including clusters b and c. objects with magnitudes down to @xmath63 were included , with priority given to red galaxies .",
    "six additional lris masks with 156 targets were observed in may 2000 .",
    "median velocity errors for the lris data are 150  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "starting in may 2003 , cl1604 was observed with deimos on the keck ii telescope .",
    "we briefly describe these observations here ; the details will be provided in a future paper releasing multi - wavelength data , including redshifts , in the cl1604 field .",
    "the first deimos observations also spanned the region imaged with cosmic , and are detailed in @xcite .",
    "galaxies as faint as @xmath64 were observed , with higher priority for red galaxies based on cosmic @xmath65 ; only 60% of the targeted objects met the red galaxy color cut .",
    "we used the 1200 l / mm grating , blazed at 7500 , and @xmath66 slits , resulting in a pixel scale of 0.33  pix@xmath24 , a resolution of @xmath671.7  ( 68 km s@xmath24 ) , and typical spectral coverage from 6385  to 9015 .",
    "data were reduced using the deep2 version of the _ spec2d _ and _ spec1d _ data reduction pipelines @xcite . since the publication of @xcite ,",
    "the deep2 team has made available their redshift measurement pipeline _ zspec _ @xcite and all deimos redshifts have now been obtained using this package .",
    "typical redshift errors using this method are 25  km  s@xmath24 , nearly a factor of four improvement over our original measures .    using the multiband lfc photometry from @xcite ,",
    "galaxies with @xmath68 were targeted over a larger area based on both color and magnitude .",
    "five deimos masks , labeled ce1 , fg1 , fg2 and ghf1 and ghf2 in fig .",
    "[ masks ] were observed in 2005 and 2006 using these ground - based color selection criteria .",
    "the cl 1604 supercluster was also the subject of a two - band 17-pointing mosaic with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , a two - pointing acis - i observation with chandra @xcite , and a very large array b - array 1.4 ghz radio map @xcite .",
    "these multi - band data were used to design additional deimos masks .",
    "the primary sample included x - ray and radio sources within the acs mosaic , and red - sequence galaxies selected on the basis of the high - precision acs colors .",
    "secondary samples included x - ray and radio sources outside the acs mosaic and bluer galaxies within the acs mosaic .",
    "lower priority samples include red galaxies outside the acs mosaic , then bluer ( by as much as 0.3@xmath69 ) galaxies outside the acs area , and finally any galaxy not already selected by the above criteria .",
    "we observed three of these masks in june 2007 .",
    "figure  [ masks ] shows the positions of the lris masks observed in may 2000 as well as all eleven deimos masks .",
    "the locations of the cluster and group candidates are also marked .",
    "this figure makes evident the uneven spectroscopic coverage of the supercluster .",
    "especially noteworthy is the extensive lris coverage of clusters a and d ; because no color selection was used for the original lris masks , the blue ( presumably star - forming ) populations in these clusters will be better sampled .",
    "nevertheless , even in regions where there is only deimos coverage , @xmath70 of the targeted galaxies were outside the red sequence .",
    "we explore the dependence of cluster velocity dispersions on the population sampling in  4.1.3 .",
    "in addition to the targeted objects , numerous serendipitous spectra were found by visual inspection .",
    "these objects had their extraction windows set manually , but were otherwise run through the same pipelines as the target objects .",
    "two of us ( rg and bl ) systematically inspected all of the _ spec2d _ created serendip one - dimensional spectra to determine whether these extractions contained genuine serendips and to confirm their redshifts .",
    "a significant number of serendips ( 180 extragalactic objects , 138 with q@xmath71 ) were found in our deimos data .",
    "many of these at the supercluster redshift show strong [ oii ] emission and little continuum .",
    "these objects represent a different population than the primary targets ( red sequence galaxies ) and may impact the velocity dispersion determination , explored in  4.1.3 .",
    "all of the spectroscopic data were combined into a single master catalog . for objects observed with both lris and deimos",
    ", we used the deimos results due to the improved redshift accuracy with the higher dispersion grism and typically higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "serendipitous spectra were matched to photometric objects from acs and/or palomar imaging .",
    "in a few cases no counterpart was found , usually for single emission line spectra , some of which are likely to be ly@xmath72 emitters at @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "each photometric identification was examined visually ( by rg ) to check for blends , interacting galaxies and misidentifications .",
    "a set of flags was added to the catalog , identifying whether or not the object was detected and/or blended in either or both the acs and palomar images .",
    "the final catalog contains a total of 1,671 unique objects . of these ,",
    "1,215 are extragalactic objects , of which 1,138 have q=3 or q=4 ;    1,148 ( 1,089 with q=3 or 4 ) of the above are matched to a cleanly detected ( not blended ) photometric object in either the acs or ground - based imaging ;    140 are stars ;    427 are in the redshift range of the supercluster ( @xmath74 ) , of which 413 have q=3 or q=4 ;    417 ( 404 with q=3 or 4 ) of the supercluster members have clean photometry .",

    "in addition to a number of clear redshift peaks in the supercluster , many intervening structures are noticeable , discussed in detail in  5 .",
    "we use only the most reliable ( q=3 or 4 ) redshifts for all of the analyses presented here .",
    "nine of the ten cluster candidates listed in table  [ candinfo ] have been extensively mapped in our spectroscopic campaign , with only cluster j lacking spectroscopic coverage .",
    "we use our dataset to examine the redshift distribution around each cluster candidate , both to verify the structures and measure velocity dispersions . because of our generous detection threshold , we expect to find structures consistent with modest sized groups as well as richer clusters .",
    "in some cases , clusters overlap each other even with the smallest radius used , and almost all clusters have companions within 1 @xmath77 mpc , as seen in fig .",
    "[ akmap ] .",
    "the complex supercluster structure makes separation of individual cluster components difficult and in some cases impossible .",
    "information on both position and velocity must be incorporated ; even so , individual clusters or groups may exhibit significant substructure @xcite .",

    "these are plotted in figure  [ velhists ] for clusters a - i . the shaded region , solid line and dashed line show the redshift distributions within 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 @xmath77 mpc , respectively . an initial redshift range ( typically spanning @xmath78 km s@xmath24 ) for each cluster is then selected by visual inspection of these plots , attempting to avoid clear redshift peaks from adjacent structures .    the extensive overlap between structures results in contamination of the redshift distributions .",
    "a good example is cluster c ( @xmath79 ) , where we see numerous galaxies at @xmath80 within a projected @xmath81 mpc radius . in this case , the redshift separation is large enough to easily distinguish the two populations .",
    "more complicated overlaps , such as between d and f , where the redshift separation is only @xmath82 , are difficult to resolve . in such cases , neglecting the overlap may lead to overestimation of the velocity dispersion .",
    "conversely , applying strict redshift limits to avoid such overlaps can artificially lower the measured dispersion .    for each cluster",
    "we follow the procedure described in @xcite and @xcite . after the initial redshift range is chosen , the cosmologically corrected velocities relative to the median cluster redshift",
    "are calculated for each galaxy within the three radii .",
    "the initial velocity windows are typically @xmath83 km s@xmath24 , sufficiently broad to avoid biasing the dispersion estimates to lower values .",
    "these distributions are iteratively clipped at @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the biweight dispersion computed by rostat @xcite .",
    "typically from 0 - 2 galaxies are excluded from each cluster by this clipping .",
    "the final dispersions are computed using the biweight estimate of the scale , with errors taken from the jackknife confidence interval on the biweight scale .",
    "these have been shown to be well - behaved under most circumstances for modest sample sizes @xcite .",
    "contamination from fore / background clusters , groups and filaments could bias the measured velocity dispersions and their associated errors when using rostat @xcite .",
    "we have used quite stringent spatial and redshift cuts to establish the starting ranges for velocity dispersion measurement , which reduces the contamination .",
    "we also examined the agreement between the @xmath84-clipped standard dispersion , the biweight estimate of the scale , and the gapped estimator , noting how many ( out of 3 maximum ) of these estimators agree within the quoted errors .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ candinfo ] .",
    "columns 5 , 8 and 11 give the number of spectroscopically confirmed members within 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 @xmath77 mpc projected radii , respectively .",
    "these numbers include only those galaxies used to compute the velocity dispersions within each radius .",

    "columns 7 , 10 and 13 also include , in parentheses , the number of different dispersion estimators that agree within the errors . despite having fewer galaxies",
    ", we would prefer the final velocity dispersions to be those measured within 0.5 @xmath77 mpc , since the smaller radius reduces contamination from overlapping clusters . however , only clusters a - d have sufficient members within this small radius to compute dispersions , so we quote the dispersions using the 1.0 @xmath77 mpc radius throughout .",
    "the final redshift intervals used for this radius are shown in fig .",
    "[ velhists ] as the vertical lines near the top of each panel .",
    "the sole exception is cluster e , which appears to be a superposition of components related to clusters b and c. we , therefore , measure no velocity dispersion and do not show its color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "if we assume that the velocity dispersion errors quoted in table  [ candinfo ] are due purely to sample size , then we would expect the errors to decrease with the square root of the number of galaxies sampled .",
    "this is almost exactly true for clusters a and d , and the quoted dispersions using different radii all agree within @xmath86 . for cluster b ,",
    "the three quoted dispersions agree very well , even though the estimated error remains nearly constant with sample size . for the remaining structures , which all have much sparser sampling and appear to be intrinsically poorer ,",
    "the effects of small numbers and contamination from interlopers make reliable dispersion estimates impossible .",
    "a good example is cluster g , where the estimated error increases despite the larger sample size when moving from 1.0 to 1.5 @xmath77 mpc projected radius .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ masks ] that clusters g and h are very close to each other .",
    "clearly , even with extensive spectroscopy it is not always possible to definitively assign membership of individual galaxies to specific clusters or groups .",
    "the behavior of our dispersions and associated errors shows that systematic errors remain an important contributor , likely due to galaxies that are not physically bound to each cluster found in the redshift range and spatial region used in the calculation .",
    "this suggests that dense sampling of cluster cores may be necessary to obtain reliable velocity dispersions .",
    "however , comparison of such data to models requires understanding of possibly cluster mass dependent biases of the observed versus true dispersions .",
    "another possibility , discussed by @xcite , is that the dispersions and errors are not measured correctly due to interlopers from filaments .",
    "the presence of an approximately uniform background results in artificially inflated dispersions .",
    "this background contribution is important as long as it is at least a modest fraction of the total sample . in @xcite",
    "they show the exaggerated case of 500 cluster members and 500 interlopers .",
    "we utilize clusters a and d to see if such interlopers affect significantly our dispersions .    one way to estimate",
    "the number of potential interlopers is to count galaxies within the same projected radius as the final assigned members , but in a velocity range outside the final window used for the dispersion calculation .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "[ velhists ] shows that there are only a few galaxies outside the final velocity windows used for clusters a and d , but less than @xmath87 km s@xmath24 away .",
    "this provides an estimate of the density of interlopers in velocity space near each cluster . as an example , consider cluster a , using the 1.0 @xmath77 mpc radius .",
    "the final velocity window containing all members used to calculate the dispersion is a top hat with half - width @xmath88 km s@xmath24 .",
    "we count all galaxies @xmath89 in the same 1.0 @xmath77 mpc radius , but with velocities between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "if the background galaxy distribution is constant with velocity , @xmath89 is also the expected number of interlopers within the cluster velocity range ( @xmath92 to @xmath93 ) . for cluster",
    "a , we find @xmath94 for r@xmath95 mpc radii .",
    "if these are all taken to be interlopers , they correspond to possible contamination rates of 5% , 9% and 8% , respectively . for cluster",
    "d , we find similar results with @xmath96 and contamination rates of 3% , 4% and 8% .",
    "this analysis assumes that _ all _ galaxies with velocities between @xmath90 and @xmath91 are interlopers , thus providing an estimate of the maximum effect that they could have .    to see",
    "if the presence of such objects could effect the velocity dispersions , we perform a monte carlo simulation with clusters a and d , using all three projected radii .",
    "we remove @xmath89 galaxies from the velocity range @xmath97 .",
    "one galaxy is removed in each velocity bin of width @xmath98 , ensuring that the likelihood of removal is flat across the entire velocity range , corresponding to contamination by a constant background .",
    "the velocity dispersion and associated errors are recomputed using the new sample , and this procedure is repeated 1000 times for each cluster and radius combination .",
    "we compute the mean velocity dispersion ( using the biweight dispersion estimator from rostat ) and mean error ( jackknife of the biweight from rostat ) for each cluster and radius combination from the 1000 monte carlo runs .",
    "we then examine ( a ) the difference between these velocity dispersions and the original estimates and ( b ) the rms scatter within the 1000 monte carlo runs .",
    "we find that the velocity dispersions calculated after removing potential interlopers are only @xmath99 lower than the initial estimates . as an example , the original dispersions for cluster a using the three radii are 532 , 619 , and 682 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the interloper - corrected estimates are 532 , 595 , and 647 km s@xmath24 , corresponding to reductions of 0% , 4.0% and 5.4% , respectively .",
    "the scatter among the monte carlo runs is 10 - 50 km s@xmath24 , depending on the cluster and radius used . adding this in quadrature to the already quoted error estimates",
    "would only increase the errors by @xmath100 .",
    "these results demonstrate that there is little bias in our velocity dispersions due to interlopers .",
    "in addition to the possibility of interlopers , the spectroscopic sampling is significantly variable from cluster to cluster , as described in  3 .",
    "this is especially true for clusters a and d , which have extensive lris data where no color cuts were applied . because the measured velocity dispersions for these ( and other ) clusters in cl1604 have decreased significantly compared to our and others earlier observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p98 , p01 ) , we examine how the sampling ( by instrument and by color ) affects the current results .",
    "first , for clusters a and d , we simply excluded the lris redshifts and measured their velocity dispersions using only the deimos data .",
    "the deimos data have significantly smaller redshift errors , and using only the deimos data makes the instrumental sampling similar for all of the clusters .",
    "we use the 1 @xmath101 mpc radius for this test to maintain a significant number of galaxies .",
    "cluster a has 26 galaxies with q@xmath71 deimos redshifts , yielding a velocity dispersion @xmath102 km / s , consistent with the results including lris ( 32 galaxies , @xmath103 km / s ) . for cluster d , the deimos - only dispersion is @xmath104 km / s from 29 galaxies , compared to @xmath105 km / s from 53 galaxies when lris data are included .",
    "these values are also consistent within the errors , although the lowered dispersion when only deimos data are used may be due to the large number of lris redshifts excluded .",
    "the lris - observed galaxies are , on average , bluer than the deimos - observed ones , and may therefore have a different dispersion .",
    "we note , however , that nearly half the deimos targets are also outside the red sequence .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of lris data for some clusters does not significantly alter our results .",
    "we further examined if the computed dispersion is different for red sequence galaxies than for the cluster population as a whole .",
    "such segregation was already shown by @xcite , who found higher dispersions for late - type galaxies than for early - types in rich , low redshift clusters .",
    "this effect should be even more pronounced at high redshift , where the clusters are less evolved .",
    "furthermore , since there is a color - density relationship , using only the red galaxies should reduce the contribution of infalling groups / filaments at the cost of smaller sample size .",
    "we applied the same color limits used for the density mapping ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) and a magnitude limit of @xmath106 to the spectroscopic samples in each cluster . only clusters a",
    ", b and d have sufficient ( though still small ) numbers of red galaxies for this exercise . using the 1 @xmath101 mpc radius to maintain a significant number of galaxies , we find : + cluster a : full sample 32 galaxies , @xmath107 km / s ; color cut 18 galaxies @xmath108 km / s + cluster b : full sample 32 galaxies , @xmath109 km / s ; color cut 12 galaxies @xmath110 km / s + cluster d : full sample 53 galaxies , @xmath105 km / s ; color cut 16 galaxies @xmath111 km / s + in all three cases , the red galaxies have a lower velocity dispersion . for cluster",
    "a the difference is @xmath112 , while for cluster d it is only @xmath113 , and less than @xmath86 for cluster b. as shown above , these changes are not the result of instrumental coverage ( deimos or lris ) , so the differences must reflect the properties of the distinct galaxy populations .",
    "it is interesting to note that our chandra observations find cluster a to be the most x - ray luminous system in the supercluster , exhibiting a relaxed and well - established intra - cluster medium @xcite .",
    "if the system formed at an earlier epoch than clusters b and d , it is expected that the primordial red galaxy population would have had more time to fully virialize and establish a much different dispersion than any infalling blue galaxy population . the lack of a significant difference in the velocity dispersions of blue and red galaxies in cluster b , and to a lesser extent cluster d , may be further evidence that the systems are undergoing collapse or possible merger processes .",
    "these results again suggest that one must exercise caution both when selecting galaxies for spectroscopic followup using colors and when interpreting the resulting cluster velocity dispersions .",
    "our sample is extremely limited , but is one of the first to have so many cluster members at redshifts near unity .",
    "the fact that the pattern of velocity dispersion as a function of galaxy color is not the same from cluster to cluster may imply that followup of only red - sequence galaxies might yield biased or inconsistent results , especially if the red vs. blue galaxy dispersion depends on the cluster mass or formation epoch",
    ". this could also be true if only the most luminous cluster galaxies are used since they are much more likely to have red colors .",
    "larger samples with deep spectroscopy of clusters in various evolutionary stages will be necessary to clarify these findings .",
    "the velocity dispersions computed for clusters a and d , using all galaxies within 0.5 or 1 @xmath77 mpc radii , are a factor of two below the initial estimates from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath85 values derived here would place these clusters closer to the @xmath114 relation , alleviating the x - ray under - luminosity discussed in @xcite .",
    "this consistency makes it tempting to assume that these are the correct dispersions to use ; however , the morphological and/or color sampling is not the same from cluster to cluster ( both due to sampling differences and population variations ) , and the x - ray luminosities may also be unreliable due to point source contamination .",
    "these results clearly require detailed comparison to simulations to see what population mix is best for producing reliable velocity dispersions that trace the gravitating halo mass .",
    "simplistic approaches to measuring cluster dispersions , especially at an epoch when they are still accreting significant portions of their final galaxy ( and mass ) content , are not likely to be reliable except for the most massive evolved systems .",
    "to better understand the individual cluster structures and possible contamination from neighboring clusters and filaments , we examined the spectroscopic coverage and position - velocity distributions within each cluster .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ posvel ] for all clusters except e ( which has no clear redshift peak ) and j ( which has no spectroscopic coverage ) .",
    "there are two panels for each cluster , each covering an area of 3.2 @xmath77 mpc on a side .",
    "the left panels show all galaxies with @xmath115 as small black dots . essentially , these are all possible spectroscopic targets in the field regardless of priority .",
    "red galaxies used to make the density map are shown as larger red dots .",
    "the concentrations in the centers of most clusters are evident , and in later deimos masks these were prioritized .",
    "black squares outline the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "spectroscopic targets which met the density map color criteria are almost always cluster members , highlighting the efficiency of our color cuts in selecting supercluster members .",
    "clusters a and d have very dense coverage because they were the first to be discovered by @xcite and were the targets of initial lris spectroscopy .",
    "the three large circles correspond to radii of 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 @xmath77 mpc , used to measure velocity dispersions .",
    "the right panels for each cluster plot all galaxies in the supercluster redshift range ( @xmath116 ) as small black dots .",
    "the final members of each cluster ( as determined using rostat within the 1.5 @xmath77 mpc radius ) are then circled .",
    "red circles are used for galaxies with higher recession velocities than the cluster mean , while blue circles show those blueshifted relative to the cluster mean .",
    "the circle sizes are scaled by the ratio of the galaxies cluster - centric radial velocity to the cluster s velocity dispersion , @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding velocity dispersion is shown in the lower right corner of each panel , along with a circle for @xmath118 .",
    "cluster e has no redshift limits marked and no velocity dispersions measured due to contamination from b and c.    examination of fig .",
    "[ posvel ] demonstrates that even the very well - sampled clusters ( a , b and d ) , with over thirty members within a 1 @xmath77 mpc radius , show visual evidence for substructure .",
    "cluster d in particular appears very elongated in the ne - sw direction .",
    "cluster b shows velocity segregation , which could be interpreted as either substructure or a triaxial cluster , elongated in the radial direction and oriented at a slight angle to the line - of - sight . to quantify the amount of substructure",
    ", we performed @xcite tests on clusters a , b and d using the spectroscopically confirmed members within a 1.0 @xmath77 mpc radius ( 32 , 32 and 53 galaxies , respectively ) .",
    "also known as the @xmath119 or ds test @xcite , this statistic looks for velocity substructure among galaxies near each other in projection as an indicator of merging components .",
    "the ds statistic was shown by @xcite to be the most sensitive of the five different substructure estimators they examined , and works well even for moderate samples with only @xmath120 velocities per cluster .",
    "this test indicates no substructure in cluster a , consistent with its appearance in fig .",
    "[ posvel ] .",
    "cluster b , although showing two velocity subclumps ( fig",
    ".  [ velhists ] ) , has no significant substructure based on the ds test .",
    "this may be the result of having two subclumps very well aligned along the line - of - sight , a situation to which the ds - test is not sensitive .",
    "cluster d has the highest likelihood of substructure , with the null hypothesis ( no substructure ) rejected at the 93% confidence level .",
    "this is consistent with the evident elongation at an angle to the line of sight and the velocity segregation between the ne and se parts of the cluster .",
    "recent work using both optical and x - ray data @xcite has shown that many clusters and groups are quite strongly triaxial , consistent with large simulations such as those of @xcite .",
    "additionally , the cl1604 supercluster is extremely elongated along the line - of - sight , and we expect , based on hubble volume simulations , that the clusters will be aligned with the supercluster @xcite .",
    "further understanding of the cluster dynamics will require detailed comparison to large @xmath121-body simulations as well as modeling of the cl1604 supercluster in particular .",
    "the presence of a strong color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) , the red sequence for early - type galaxies , has long been observed @xcite and used for cluster detection @xcite . at the redshift of the cl1604 supercluster , galaxies become too small to classify morphologically from ground - based images .",
    "recent work has used hst imaging to examine the cmr in high - redshift clusters @xcite , and in particular cl1604 + 4304 and cl1604 + 4321 @xcite . in a forthcoming study , we will combine our extensive spectroscopic database with a new hst acs mosaic of the cl1604 supercluster to extend such work to a wider range of environments . here , we briefly discuss the ground - based cmds of the individual clusters .    figure  [ cmrs ] shows the @xmath48 vs. @xmath30 and @xmath122 vs. @xmath31 cmds for each of the clusters ( note that e is excluded ; see  4.1.1 ) in cl1604 using only objects determined to be photometrically clean in the ground - based lfc and cosmic imaging .",
    "small black points indicate all galaxies in the full imaged area having redshifts consistent with supercluster membership ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "large red dots are galaxies determined to be members of each specific cluster at radii @xmath123 mpc",
    ". we plot open hexagons for galaxies at @xmath124 mpc , filled squares for @xmath125 mpc , and filled triangles for @xmath126 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "first , we note that the photometric errors are significant for fainter galaxies . at @xmath127 , for instance , the typical error is 0.1@xmath69 ; added in quadrature with another band , we expect at least 0.15@xmath69 of scatter at @xmath127 from photometric uncertainties alone .",
    "the intrinsic width of the red sequence , due to age differences at fixed galaxy mass , is only @xmath128 in clusters at @xmath1 @xcite , similar to that observed locally @xcite .",
    "the expected slope of the red sequence , a consequence of metallicity changes with galaxy mass , is also small , of order @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "thus , our ground based observations are not sufficiently accurate to measure these quantities .    nevertheless , a few general observations are possible .",
    "the red sequence is most prominent in clusters a and b , which also have the highest velocity dispersions , consistent with the morphology - density and color - density relations @xcite and its disappearance in low density environments by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "cluster d , with a velocity dispersion only 5% lower than cluster a , shows a distinctly less pronounced red sequence .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ colordist ] , which shows the distribution of @xmath39 colors for spectroscopically confirmed members of clusters a and d. the left panel shows galaxies with @xmath130 , the depth of the complete lris spectroscopy in a and d. at these magnitudes , red galaxies have @xmath131 , with photometric errors of @xmath132 in @xmath29 and @xmath133 in @xmath30 , or color errors of @xmath128 .",
    "the right panel shows fainter galaxies , with @xmath134 , where the errors are much larger .",
    "the solid histograms indicate galaxies in a , while the dotted line is for cluster d. the excess of bluer ( @xmath135 ) galaxies in cluster d is evident , especially in the fainter population .",
    "looking at the left panel , cluster a has eleven luminous red ( @xmath136 ) galaxies , while cluster d ( cl1604 + 4321 ) , although apparently rich , has only six .",
    "if we examine the most luminous objects , the brightest red galaxy in d has @xmath137 ; cluster a has five more luminous galaxies , extending to @xmath138 .",
    "the lack of luminous red galaxies coupled with the presence of numerous bluer galaxies in d results in a dilution of the red - sequence , making it appear much less prominent than in cluster a. clusters a and d have magnitude - limited spectroscopy for all objects with @xmath62 from the @xcite lris fields , covering a @xmath139 area ( @xmath140 mpc ) around each cluster , so the differences in the luminous galaxy populations between a and d are certainly real and not selection effects .",
    "the absence of luminous galaxies in d is also not an effect of simply having fewer galaxies as a result of its lower velocity dispersion ( mass ) ; cluster a has 1.8 times as many objects with @xmath141 and @xmath142 , while we would expect only @xmath100 more if we assume @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the discrepancy only gets worse if we look at the most luminous galaxies ( @xmath145 ) , where there are five times more in a than in d. to explain this as purely a result of a s large mass , we would have to increase the dispersion of a by @xmath146 while at the same time decreasing d s dispersion by @xmath146 , resulting in a mass ratio of 4.8 , comparable to , but still lower than , the factor of five difference in luminous red galaxies .",
    "similarly , the fainter galaxy population differences between a and d are also physical , as they are sampled by both second - epoch lris and later deimos slitmasks , with similar coverage .",
    "our findings are consistent with the hst results of @xcite , who had fewer redshifts but more precise photometry . combined with its elongated morphology",
    ", these data suggest that cl1604 + 4321 ( d ) is a cluster in the process of formation , and therefore has not yet had time to build up its red sequence and assemble massive red galaxies .",
    "the remaining structures have insufficient spectral coverage or too few members with clean ground - based imaging to make conclusive statements about their galaxy populations .",
    "however , it is clear that many galaxies in the supercluster are associated _ not _ with the individual clusters but with the connecting filaments instead .",
    "this implies that studies of the cluster cmr at high redshift that rely on purely photometric data may overestimate the width of the red sequence due to contamination by dynamically dissociated galaxies .",
    "estimates of the blue galaxy fraction may be similarly compromised .",
    "studies of low - redshift superclusters have also found that @xmath147 of supercluster members are not associated with specific clusters @xcite ; this fraction will only increase at larger lookback times as the structures are less collapsed .",
    "as noted above , many galaxies in the redshift range of the supercluster are not associated with any of the clusters / groups .",
    "we use our entire redshift catalog of 413 q@xmath71 confirmed members to construct a three - dimensional map of the supercluster . to produce this map",
    ", we assume that individual galaxy redshifts directly reflect the position of the galaxy within the structure .",
    "this is not strictly correct , since the clusters within the structure can have significant velocities relative to the hubble flow , and the galaxies within the clusters also have their own peculiar velocities .",
    "however , we have no other data to constrain the dynamics within this region . if the structure is bound , then the clusters themselves may have significant peculiar velocities within the supercluster , further complicating any dynamical analysis .",
    "the redshift depth of the supercluster , taken at face value , implies a radial length of order @xmath148 , while the transverse size ( using clusters a and j ) is only @xmath149 .",
    "figures  [ threed1 ] ,  [ threed2 ] and  [ threed3 ] show three views of the supercluster . because of the nearly 8:1 axis ratio",
    ", we have compressed the radial axis by a factor of five .",
    "we show red and blue galaxies , divided at @xmath150 as correspondingly colored spheres .",
    "each sphere is scaled by the observed @xmath30 luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "figure  [ threed1 ] shows the face - on view of the supercluster , as observed on the sky .",
    "clusters a , b and d can be clearly seen .",
    "the large red galaxy population in a is evident , as is the elongation of cluster d. figure  [ threed2 ] shows the radial distribution of galaxies in cl1604 as a function of declination .",
    "the individual clusters are clear , along with the large number of intercluster galaxies .",
    "color segregation is easily seen , although luminous red galaxies do exist far outside the cluster centers , and luminous blue galaxies are present in the lower - mass clusters and groups .",
    "the most luminous blue galaxies are almost exclusively found in the filaments , far from the cluster cores .",
    "there are also large voids in the overall galaxy distribution , consistent with the structures seen in large simulations .",
    "finally , figure  [ threed3 ] shows a rotated view of the supercluster , making its overall structure clearer . from these figures",
    "it appears that cluster b at @xmath151 is relatively isolated from the rest of the supercluster .",
    "determining whether it is actually bound to the overall structure or a more isolated foreground object will require detailed @xmath121-body simulations mimicking this supercluster .",
    "besides the supercluster , a variety of apparent fore- and background structures can be seen in figure  [ spechist ] .",
    "we apply three different criteria to identify coherent overdensities in both redshift and in projection .",
    "candidate structures are selected by taking each galaxy with a measured redshift as a seed , and searching for peaks both in redshift and in projection .",
    "we look for groups of galaxies that meet at least one of the following three requirements :    * a. 15 or more concordant redshifts within @xmath152 , no spatial requirement * b. 5 or more concordant redshifts within @xmath152 and within a @xmath153mpc radius * c. 5 or more concordant redshifts within @xmath152 and within a @xmath154 mpc radius    the redshift interval of @xmath152 used in peak selection corresponds to a velocity width of @xmath155 km s@xmath24 , broader than the expected dispersion of all but the most massive clusters , and is identical to the criterion of @xcite . criterion a includes structures like walls or filaments which might be rejected by the latter .",
    "criteria b and c more closely match other surveys that do spectroscopic followup in a limited spatial region around candidate clusters .",
    "criterion a selects a total of 18 redshift peaks outside the supercluster redshift range .",
    "criterion b selects 6 peaks , all of which are also found by a , while criterion c selects 13 peaks , 11 of which are also selected by a. although these candidate structures are chosen based on well - defined criteria , the uneven spatial coverage , survey depth , color selection , and biases such as easier identification of emission - line objects imply that this sample is neither complete nor unbiased ( in redshift or galaxy type ) .",
    "whether or not these structures are real or artifacts of our color selection and spatial sampling requires looking in greater detail at the spatial distributions and cmrs of galaxies in each apparent redshift peak .",
    "these are plotted in figures  [ bgclus]a - e .",
    "each row corresponds to a different peak in the redshift histogram , starting at @xmath156 .",
    "the first column shows the redshift histogram in the region of the specific redshift peak , with dashed lines demarcating the initial redshift range @xmath152 used to select the peak with criterion a. the left panel includes a roman numeral corresponding to the structures tallied in table  [ losinfo ] , followed by letters denoting which criteria are met by the peak .",
    "we also show the number of galaxies in the peak based on each of the criteria by which it is selected .",
    "the median redshift is included , again using all criterion a galaxies .",
    "the second column shows the projected distribution of galaxies in the redshift peak ( within @xmath152 ) as large dots overlaid on the overall distribution of spectroscopic objects .",

    "if there is an apparent projected overdensity of objects as defined by criteria b and/or c , we plot a circle of radius @xmath154 mpc around the structure centroid , using the mean positions of the galaxies within the apparent projected overdensity ( except for structure vii , as detailed below ) .",

    "these could be sparse walls or filaments crossing our field , or simple statistical fluctuations .",

    "there is a concentration just west of cluster d , but insufficient to meet either of the spatial criteria .",

    "all of these galaxies are very faint ( @xmath182 ) and are detected spectroscopically from their oii emission alone , consistent with their broad range in colors . if the velocity dispersion is reflective of the group mass , this is the highest redshift group of such low mass known .    from the third column in fig  [ bgclus ]",
    "we see that many of the structures , especially at @xmath183 , contain significant numbers of galaxies with colors consistent with supercluster membership .",
    "some of these show projected density peaks near components of the supercluster , which likely contributed to the detectability of low - mass groups and filaments in the region . narrowing the color range",
    "slightly would not eliminate their contributions to the density map .",
    "the cmds and redshift distributions of the structures demonstrate the difficulty of establishing the physical nature of moderate - mass , high - redshift systems .",
    "it is extremely common practice to detect clusters with some photometric technique , and report as few as three redshifts for confirmation .",
    "for instance , @xcite examined spectroscopy in the fields of five @xmath184 clusters in the eso imaging survey ( eis ) cluster candidate catalog , and found numerous groups in many of the fields , often with only three concordant redshifts ( such as eisj0046 - 2951 ) .",
    "they find multiple redshift peaks in some of their fields , and rely on the alignment of galaxies in each redshift peak with the location of the candidate derived from the initial imaging to determine confirmations and assign redshifts .",
    "they do not specify a minimum area within which these three redshifts had to be found ( with statistical significance tests relying purely on redshift distributions with no spatial information ) , nor detail the spectroscopic completeness ( especially as a function of color ) , making statistical statements impossible .",
    "however , inspection of their figures shows that these objects were typically within a @xmath185 arcminute diameter region inside the large spectroscopic field .",
    "similarly , @xcite performed follow - up observations of rcs @xcite clusters , and often found only 3 - 5 concordant redshifts for the candidates .",
    "they follow the arguments of @xcite , similar to those of @xcite and @xcite , to conclude that finding just three concordant redshifts for early type galaxies in a field with 5 arcmin radius at @xmath186 results in a @xmath187 likelihood of having a true structure .",
    "this radius corresponds to @xmath185 arcminutes at @xmath188 .    to qualitatively assess the reliability of cluster confirmation using so few concordant redshifts",
    ", we examined each of our redshift peaks which meet only criterion a , and _ not _ criteria b or c. there are 7 such peaks comprising @xmath189 of our candidates .",
    "this provides a sample of galaxies that are in redshift peaks but not contained in any obvious spatial structure .",
    "we could simply assume that all of these are projections , implying that requiring _ no _ spatial coincidence results in at least a @xmath190 false positive rate for cluster confirmation .",
    "we caution that even candidate structures meeting criteria b or c may be projections ( which would imply an increase in the false positive rate ) , and that some structures that only meet criterion a may be real ( decreasing the false positive rate ) . as noted earlier ,",
    "applying our spectroscopic selection in detail to large cosmological simulations with realistic galaxy distributions and colors is needed to definitively understand the nature of the detected structures .    to compare more directly with the studies mentioned above , we must account for our higher redshift sampling . for instance , @xcite have 266 redshifts in 5 fields .",
    "they do not provide the area coverage of their spectroscopy , so we estimate a spectroscopic area coverage of @xmath191 sq .",
    "arcmin based on their figures , or a redshift density of @xmath192 per sq .",
    "this compares to our 1138 redshifts in @xmath193 sq .",
    "arcmin , a sampling rate of 3.8 per sq .",
    "arcmin . excluding the lris redshifts , which cover small regions around clusters a and d , we have 3.0 redshifts per sq . arcmin .",
    "our redshift sampling is indeed greater by a factor of @xmath185 .",
    "our area coverage is also a factor of @xmath185 greater .",
    "however , we require five times more galaxies in each peak ( 15 as opposed to 3 ) , approximately compensating for these factors . thus , our estimated 35% false positive rate may be indicative of the rate expected in @xcite .",
    "if instead we reduce our requirement to account purely for the difference in sampling , we need only @xmath194 galaxies per peak , but contained within a region comparable to the spectroscopic fields of @xcite , about @xmath195 .",
    "this yields 22 candidate peaks , and they are almost identical to those found from our full area and requiring 15 galaxies in the peak , suggesting that our false positive rate is reasonable .",
    "comparison to @xcite is more difficult , since they do not provide information on the effective area covered in each field , magnitude limits , or color selection .",
    "however , examination of their fig .",
    "2 shows numerous cases where there is no obvious redshift peak , especially for fields that are poorly sampled .",
    "we also consider how rapidly the number of candidates increases with area for a fixed number of galaxies per redshift peak .",
    "our original criterion b requires 5 concordant galaxies within a @xmath153mpc radius ; the typical area covered is 5 sq .",
    "similarly , criterion c encompasses @xmath196 sq .",
    "arcmin on average , while the eis area is 25 sq .",
    "we find 6 , 13 , and 22 candidates using these search areas , respectively .",
    "visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ bgclus ] suggests that even criterion c may yield structures that are not obviously physical associations , and sampling even larger areas and requiring fewer than five concordant redshifts can only exacerbate this problem .    alternatively , the redshift peaks in our data showing minimal spatial structure ( i.e.",
    ", meeting only criterion a ) provide a test sample to estimate the likelihood of false positives from small projected galaxy groupings . to do this ,",
    "we examine each galaxy in each of the redshift peaks selected only by criterion a. for each galaxy , we count the number of neighbors within 0.25 , 0.5 and 2 @xmath77 mpc radii ( 31 `` , 62 '' , 4.13 at @xmath188 ) . we then count how many projected groupings of @xmath197 galaxies are present for each peak , mimicking some of the selections used in other surveys . using the smallest radius , 3 out of 6 redshift peaks",
    "have a group of at least 3 galaxies within the required area . increasing the test radius to 0.5 @xmath77 mpc results in all but one of these redshift peaks containing a group of three or even four nearby galaxies .",
    "for the largest test radius , every redshift peak contains at least three and as many as five distinct groups , and these groups typically have 6 - 11 members .",
    "these results suggest that , with our sampling , requiring only 3 galaxies even in a very small area is likely to produce false structures . at the largest radius ( 2 @xmath77 mpc )",
    "we are covering areas similar to those in @xcite and @xcite . adjusting for the lower sampling in @xcite , nearly all of our criterion - a - only peaks",
    "would have 3 concordant redshifts within a comparable field size .",
    "however , only one of these peaks would have 4 or more concordant redshifts .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that sparse spectroscopic sampling over modest regions can easily produce spurious redshift peaks .",
    "we note that this analysis includes not just red sequence galaxies , since in some cases we do not sample the rs at the redshift of the peak .",
    "this may increase the likelihood of finding chance projections .",
    "if we required instead a small number of concordant redshifts and that these objects were also along the red sequence , we would have many fewer candidates and eliminate many potentially spurious groups .",
    "however , most spectroscopic follow - up studies do not impose such a requirement .",
    "in addition , for poor groups , we might not expect to see a strong red sequence at redshifts like those studied here , so requiring a red sequence might eliminate otherwise physical structures .",
    "our analysis also does not consider the alignment of small redshift peaks with cluster candidates pre - selected using photometric redshifts or red sequence techniques .",
    "the likelihood of finding a redshift peak with @xmath198 galaxies at the location of a cluster candidate and with redshift comparable to the photometric estimate is certainly much lower than finding a peak at any redshift along the line of sight .",
    "however , we have shown that in a modest field , it is easy to find peaks with @xmath198 galaxies at almost any redshift , so using such data to confirm candidate clusters is questionable .",
    "a competing effect is low spectroscopic completeness , decreasing the likelihood of finding close projections .",
    "if we use simple criteria of three galaxies within a velocity window of @xmath83 km s@xmath24 and a radius of 0.25 @xmath77 mpc , every redshift peak along the line - of - sight would qualify as a physical structure . while this may be true",
    ", it is unlikely . given the complex sampling , we would have to replicate our observations on large mock galaxy catalogs to give correct likelihoods for each structure .",
    "this problem will persist for surveys like orelse , and for large sky surveys such as pan - starrs and lsst , where spectroscopic followup of complete samples of faint , distant galaxies will be difficult .",
    "detection of high - redshift clusters using photometric techniques can be affected by line - of - sight projections over radial distances comparable to the redshift resolution of simple color - based techniques .",
    "@xcite show that many clusters detected in a red - sequence type survey at @xmath1 are made up of galaxies from multiple distinct cluster - size dark matter halos .",
    "their work does not include smaller groups , of which we expect to find many in the infall regions of high - redshift clusters .",
    "they also demonstrate that the problem becomes substantially worse at @xmath1 than it is at @xmath199 , in part because a fixed pair of filters can not sample features such as the 4000   break over such a broad redshift range .",
    "we find many small groups in both the fore- and background of the target structure at @xmath13 . examination of model galaxy tracks from @xcite in the @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 color - color space for both galaxies with a single burst at @xmath200 and the rcs model ( a 0.1 gyr burst ending at @xmath44 with a @xmath45 gyr exponential decline thereafter ) shows that colors for galaxies over a moderately broad redshift range ( @xmath201 ) are quite similar , with the differences in color comparable to ground - based photometric errors ( orelse i ) .",
    "therefore , any survey relying on only two- or three - color moderate - depth ground - based imaging is subject to this type of confusion .",
    "the surveys will be biased toward detecting projected systems , the same problem that has plagued lower redshift optical cluster catalogs @xcite .",
    "even with large cosmological simulations , the detailed effects of such projections on cluster detection , number counts , and mass estimates will be difficult to quantify .",
    "the most recent studies @xcite using the millennium simulation and a red - sequence cluster finder are still hampered by the inability of simulations to reproduce the observed colors of cluster galaxies .",
    "extensive spectroscopy of at least a subset of clusters found using optical and x - ray surveys is needed to understand the contamination rates , redshift distributions , substructure , and other cluster properties ; such work is only now under way @xcite .",
    "given that such projections can only enhance the detectability of lower mass systems , as well as inflate velocity dispersions and increase the weak lensing signal , mass estimates for single bound cluster components using such techniques will always tend to be overestimated .",
    "a striking example is cluster a ( cl1604 + 4304 ) , whose initial velocity dispersion estimate was 1200 km s@xmath24 @xcite . adding many more spectra , but not tightly restricting the area sampled",

    "our data shows that such filaments may be common at @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , completely independent structures along the line - of - sight can be cause for concern , even at low redshift @xcite .",

    "both types of structures can affect the derived mass profiles .",

    "it is not yet known how much this can affect the overall distribution of observed concentrations and masses from weak lensing . implementing techniques that incorporate multi - wavelength data ( x - ray , sunyaev - zeldovich , optical ) can overcome some of these issues , but requires both extensive data and computational power @xcite , limiting it to rich , low - redshift clusters or only the most massive structures at higher redshift for the time being . with somewhat less data ,",
    "it is possible to compare x - ray and weak lensing masses for clusters .",
    "recent work using observational data has shown moderate agreement between these two techniques , but discrepancies are plentiful and systematic errors are much too large for precision cosmological measurements @xcite .",
    "in contrast , some lensing simulations claim that high completeness , low contamination , and good mass fidelity can be achieved with weak lensing @xcite , but this has yet to be proven with large samples of real data .",
    "weak lensing has already been used to estimate the mass of cl1604 + 4304 ( cluster a , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a mass of @xmath204 , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of @xmath205 km s@xmath24 .",

    "nevertheless , its estimated mass varies by a factor of nearly two .",
    "improved x - ray measurements from deep chandra observations @xcite and lensing data from a recent acs mosaic , combined with our spectroscopic database , may help resolve this discrepancy .    instead of measuring individual cluster masses , one could avoid some of the above problems with a sufficiently large and deep survey by calculating the mass on very large ( @xmath210 mpc ) scales over several superclusters , and comparing the results to simulations and structure formation theories , but such surveys remain in the future . with excellent deep photometric data ,",
    "it is also possible to use weak lensing tomography , incorporating photometric redshifts to map all the galaxies along the line - of - sight .",
