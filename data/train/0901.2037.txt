    "the understanding of multi - scale problems is believed to be a key to gain deeper knowledge in basic plasma physics .",
    "the multi - scale analysis have had great success during the last couple of years and been able to give great insight in the complex plasma physical processes in e.g. the zonal flow - drift wave system  @xcite .",
    "there are a large number of theoretical - analytical studies devoted to multi - scale problems using different background physics refs  @xcite-  @xcite and there have also been intensive numerical investigations using gyrokinetic  @xcite-  @xcite and advanced fluid models  @xcite-  @xcite of the the zonal flow - drift wave system .",
    "the problem of anomalously high ion heat transport believed to be generated by the ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) mode turbulence and controlled by the secondary generated zonal flows is one of the typical multi - scale problems  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the zonal flows are azimuthally symmetric shear flows with temporal variation with time scales longer than the drift waves and having disparate spatial scale lengths .",
    "this is often utilized to reduce the fully coupled system to an analytically tractable problem .",
    "it is most plausible that robust quasi - stationary zonal flows may suppress the ion heat transport and give access to improved confinement regimes in tokamak plasmas .",
    "thus , the understanding of the dynamical system of zonal flow - drift waves is of great importance for controlling the anomalous transport and the formation of internal transport barriers ( itb ) .    the zonal flow - drift wave system has been studied previously using multi - scale analysis for different physics such as the electromagnetic itg mode  @xcite , the trapped - electron - mode ( tem )  @xcite , the electron - temperature - gradient ( etg ) mode  @xcite ,  @xcite etc . in the case of tem background turbulence",
    "the generation of zonal flows seem to be much weaker than for the electrostatic itg mode  @xcite and also for the etg mode the zonal flow instability is quite weak .",
    "it has been speculated that the importance of zonal flows is of less interest in etg turbulence .",
    "the problem of multi - scale interaction between a tearing mode and drift waves has just recently been discussed  @xcite .",
    "there are several analytical models for treating multi - scale interactions and among the widely used models are the coherent mode coupling method  @xcite ,  @xcite-  @xcite , the wave kinetic equation approach  @xcite ,  @xcite-  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite-  @xcite ,  @xcite and the reductive perturbation expansion method  @xcite ,  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "there is indeed little comparative knowledge of the differences in the current methods used .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to compare and point out differences in two of the main approaches to treat multi - scale problems .",
    "the comparison is done by deriving a model for a zonal flow generated from background itg turbulence using the method of coherent mode coupling and compare this to an existing model derived using the wave kinetic equation ( wke )  @xcite ,  @xcite using the same background physics and assumptions .",
    "direct numerical simulations has been performed , showing that the scale separation assumed in the wke model breaks down during the simulations  @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the method proposed here and also briefly discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are complementing this previous line of research to find deeper understanding for the approximations made in multi - scale modeling .    in this paper ,",
    "an algebraic dispersion relation for zonal flow growth rate and real frequency is derived using the coherent mode coupling method in the presence of toroidal itg turbulence .",
    "the model for the background turbulence is based on the ion - continuity and the ion - temperature - equation .",
    "the evolution of the zonal flow is described by a hasegawa - mima like equation .",
    "the models employed are electrostatic and effects of trapping are neglected .",
    "it is found that the two different models for estimating the effects of multi - scale interaction , in this particular case the interaction of itg driven drift waves and a zonal flow , are in good quantitative and qualitative agreement in the region of maximum linear drift wave growth rate ( close to @xmath0 ) . in all cases",
    "good qualitative agreement was found .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the analytical model for the zonal flows generated from toroidal itg modes is reviewed .",
    "section iii is dedicated to the results and a discussion thereof .",
    "finally there is a summary in section iv .",
    "the model for the toroidal itg driven modes consists of the ion continuity and ion temperature equations  @xcite . in the present work",
    "the effects of magnetic shear , trapped particles and finite beta is neglected .",
    "it has been found earlier that the effect of parallel ion motion on the itg mode is rather weak  @xcite , however , it is recently found that magnetic shear may modify the zonal flow generation significantly  @xcite .",
    "the effects of magnetic shear is out of the scope of the present paper . in this section",
    "the model using the coherent mode coupling is presented . the method how to construct the interaction of a zonal flow and the itg mode turbulence and the derivation of the dispersion relation for zonal flows follows earlier papers  @xcite ,  @xcite-  @xcite ( and references therein ) .",

    "it is assumed that there is a sufficient spectral gap between the small scale fluctuations and the large scale flow i.e. for the poloidal wavenumber it is assumed that @xmath47 and the wave kinetic equation is solved in the radial direction . it is also assumed that there is enough difference in the temporal variation of micro turbulence and zonal flow ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the electrostatic potential is represented as a sum of fluctuating and mean quantities . in the case of zonal flows ( @xmath39 ) generated from itg mode turbulence the dispersion relation is @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the group velocity for the drift wave and the other parameters are the same as above .",

    "the scalings of the growth rate ( positive sign ) and real frequency ( negative sign ) are linear .",
    "the coherent mode coupling model has a slightly more complicated behavior where a maximum growth rate is found close to @xmath73 .",
    "the two models exhibits completely different scaling in @xmath38 , however , the scalings with other parameters are conserved and it is only a change in the levels . in deriving the wke dispersion relation , a state close to marginal stability was assumed and the feature of a non vanishing zonal flow growth rate for small @xmath38 may be recovered if this assumption is discarded .",
    "however , it should be noted that for @xmath74 the reynolds stress is identically zero and the driving term disappears thus the zonal flow growth rate is zero at this particular value .",
