    "( i.e. conformally rescaled ) spacetime manifold ( null infinity , @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "this smoothness at null infinity implies that the fields in the physical spacetime manifold have the peeling behaviour .",
    "however , this assumption may be too strong for a number of physical applications ( see for example @xcite and references within ) .",
    "in particular , the case for the so - called _ polyhomogeneous spacetimes and zero - rest - mass fields _ has been rised @xcite .",
    "a generic peeling ( smooth ) field possesses an analytic expansion around null infinity ( given by @xmath1 ) .",
    "by contrast , the expansions of polyhomogeneous fields around @xmath0 are laurent - like ( so that the field in the physical spacetime is non - peeling ) , and also contain powers of @xmath2 .",
    "so far , the study of polyhomogeneous fields has been carried out assuming that the diverse fields admit expansions of the required form .",
    "however , the expansions are formal in the sense that the convergence ( and hence the existence and uniqueness ) of the series has not been discussed .",
    "this point , so many times overlooked , is of fundamental importance .",
    "it could be well the case that none of the formal expansions converge !",
    "the objective of this article is to provide a first step towards the understanding of the convergence of polyhomogeneous fields .",
    "here , i analyse the possible convergence of a polyhomogeneous spin-1 zero - rest - mass field ( maxwell field ) propagating on an asymptotically simple spacetime .",
    "the spin-1 zero - rest - mass field has been chosen in order to ease the discussion and the calculations , but the treatment here discussed can be directly extended to the case of say , a spin-2 field .",
    "it is also expected that similar techniques can be used to analyse the analogous question for the gravitational field . however , in that case one should expect a number of complications .",
    "furthermore , again for concreteness , only the simplest case of spin-1 zero - rest - mass fields will be discussed : the so - called minimally polyhomogeneous .",
    "this case contains all the difficulties one could expect from the generic polyhomogeneous situation , but the algebra is much simpler",
    "!    the question of the convergence of the polyhomogeneous expansions will be tackled by posing an _ asymptotic characteristic initial value problem _ for the minimally polyhomogeneous spin-1 zero - rest - mass field , and proving that such a problem has a ( unique ) solution in a given neighbourhood of the spacetime which is polyhomogeneous ( i.e. the solution has convergent polyhomogeneous expansion in the given neighbourhood ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be an asymptotically simple spacetime .",
    "it will be assumed that null infinity is smooth ( non - polyhomogeneous ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be the unphysical spacetime obtained by means of the conformal rescaling @xmath5 .",
    "the spacetime will be taken to be completely known .",
    "in particular this means that the asymptotic expansions of the spin coefficients , and the tetrad functions are known .",
    "let @xmath6 be the initial ( future oriented ) null hypersurface , and let @xmath7 be its intersection with future null infinity , @xmath8 .",
    "following penrose & rindler s notation , @xmath9 will denote equality at null infinity .    to describe the spacetime and the different fields involved",
    ", i will make use of the coordinates and null tetrad described by friedrich & stewart . in their original version , these coordinates and null tetrad were used to describe the spacetime between two intersecting null hypersurfaces @xcite .",
    "here they are adapted to describe the region of spacetime in the causal past of the intersection of future null infinity ( @xmath10 ) , and a future oriented null hypersurface .",
    "the construction is of interest in itself , and its highlights are given for the sake of reference .",
    "the physical spacetime @xmath3 is asymptotically flat , thus @xmath7 has the topology of the 2-sphere , @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be an arbitrary point of @xmath7 , and let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be the null generators of @xmath6 and @xmath10 through @xmath12 respectively .",
    "a null tetrad @xmath15 at @xmath12 can be chosen such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 span @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are tangent to @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "one can also choose an arbitrary coordinate system , @xmath21 , at @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath22 ( retarded time ) be a parameter along the null geodesic generators @xmath14 of @xmath10 , such that @xmath23 at @xmath12 .",
    "note that in principle @xmath22 is not an affine parameter . repeating this construction for different points,@xmath12 ,",
    "one obtains a scalar field that vanishes precisely at @xmath7 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath21 can now be extended to the remainder of @xmath10 by requiring the coordinates to be constant along the generators of @xmath10 . in this way we have constructed a coordinate chart @xmath24 for @xmath10 valid at least around @xmath7 .",
    "one can undertake an analogous construction for the generators @xmath13 of @xmath6 , obtaining a parameter @xmath25 ( advanced time ) such that at @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "again , the parameter @xmath25 is not affine in principle .",
    "thus , one ends up with a coordinate chart @xmath28 for @xmath6 .",
    "now , on @xmath10 there is a 1-parameter family of spacelike hypersurfaces , @xmath29 ( cuts ) on which @xmath22 is constant . for each @xmath29",
    "there is a unique null hypersurface @xmath30 containing @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) extending into the interior of the unphysical spacetime .",
    "this yields a foliation of the spacetime by null hypersurfaces at least close to @xmath10 note that the foliation could give rise to caustics and cusps .",
    "similarly , one can obtain another 1-parameter family of null hypersurfaces @xmath33 for which @xmath25 is constant and that intersect @xmath6 .",
    "in particular one has that @xmath34 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath21 can now also be extended to the interior of the spacetime by requiring them to be constant along the null generators of @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath21 are not constant along the generators of the @xmath35 foliation ( except for @xmath10 ) for the null vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 which will be taken as tangent to the null generators of @xmath30 and @xmath35 respectively do not in general commute .    to extend the null tetrad defined in @xmath7 ,",
    "one begins by defining @xmath36 on @xmath37 by @xmath38 .",
    "therefore @xmath19 is tangent to the null generators of @xmath6 , and is parallel to the @xmath19 already defined at @xmath7 .",
    "a boost on the null tetrad defined at @xmath7 can be used to make the two vectors equal .",
    "thus , there exists a scalar function @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath41 .",
    "next , the @xmath42 is defined on @xmath37 by @xmath43 , so that @xmath20 is tangent to the null generators of @xmath44 and the normalisation condition @xmath45 is satisfied .",
    "together with @xmath46 this implies , @xmath47 .",
    "due to the constancy of the @xmath21 coordinates along the generators of @xmath10 , one has that @xmath48 .",
    "following the standard np notation , let @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the vector @xmath16 defined so far only on @xmath7 is propagated onto the remaining of @xmath10 via the equation @xmath51 .",
    "finally @xmath16 is propagated from @xmath10 to the interior of @xmath37 via @xmath52 .",
    "this together with the nullity and orthogonality requirements imply that @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the aforediscussed null tetrad has the form : @xmath54 where @xmath48 , and @xmath39 , @xmath55 are of order @xmath56 . from this tetrad construction one",
    "also deduces that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 in @xmath37 . in particular",
    "one also has that all the spin coefficients with the exception of @xmath62 vanish at @xmath10 : that is , they are of order @xmath63 . on the other hand , @xmath62 is @xmath56 .",
    "finally , notice that the aforediscussed construction fixes also the associated spin basis @xmath64 .",
    "a spin - s zero - rest - mass field is a totally symmetric spinor field ( @xmath65 ) , satisfying : @xmath66 where the indices @xmath67 number @xmath68 . in order to ease the discussion , in this article",
    "we will restrict ourselves to spin 1 zero - rest - mass fields ( maxwell field ) .",
    "the extension of the results to spin 2 fields ( linear gravity ) is direct .",
    "the components of the spin 1 zero - rest - mass field in the aforementioned spin basis are : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "let us consider zero - rest - mass fields belonging to @xmath72 , i.e. fields that are infinite differentiable ( smooth ) in the interior of the unphysical spacetime ( @xmath73 ) but need not to be so at the boundary ( @xmath0 ) of the spacetime ; this is the meaning of the @xmath74 label . in particular our attention",
    "will be centered on the so - called _ polyhomogeneous fields _ , which are @xmath72 zero - rest - mass fields with asymptotic expansions in terms of powers of a particular parameter ( e.g. the conformal factor , and affine parameter of outgoing null geodesics , a luminosity parameter , an advanced time ) , and powers of the logarithm .",
    "the most general polyhomogeneous spin-1 zero - rest - mass field is of the form , @xmath75 where the @xmath76 s are polynomials in @xmath77 with coefficients in @xmath78 .",

    "a peeling field should behave like @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , looking at the spin-1 zero - rest - mass field in the unphysical ( conformally rescaled ) spacetime one has , @xmath80 so that the field is not regular ( diverges ! ) at @xmath10 ( where @xmath1 ) , first because of the term @xmath81 , and also because of the presence of logarithmic terms in @xmath82 .    in order to ease the discussion",
    ", the discussion in this article will be reduced to the case of the so - called minimally polyhomogeneous fields .",
    "an extension to more general polyhomogeneous fields can be easily done .",
    "a minimally polyhomogeneous spin-1 zero - rest - mass field is of the form ( in the physical spacetime ) : @xmath83 which in the unphysical spacetime looks like , @xmath84 using the `` constraint equations '' , i.e. the @xmath85-maxwell equations one can deduce several relations connecting the diverse coefficients of the different components of the spin-1 zero - rest - mass field .",
    "in particular one has that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the ethbar differential operator ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this relation will be used later .",
    "so far , the asymptotic expansions have been in @xmath88 .",
    "however , it can be seen that , @xmath89 so that one could alternatively use the retarded time as the expansion parameter .",
    "_ this will be done in the remainder of the article_. one can even redefine @xmath90 so that @xmath91 .",
    "a minimally polyhomogeneous field contains at the most first powers of @xmath2 .",
    "if one provides @xmath92 on an initial null hypersurface @xmath93 , and the coefficients @xmath94 at @xmath95 and @xmath96 for all times , one can use the equations ( [ m3 ] ) and ( [ m4 ] ) on to obtain the components @xmath97 and @xmath98 on @xmath93 , and then the evolution equations ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) to generate the field by `` slices '' .",
    "this procedure allows us to calculate formal polyhomogeneous expansions for the zero - rest - mass field .",
    "as mentioned previously in the introduction , the question to be investigated here regards the convergence of such formal polyhomogeneous expansions , i.e. we want to know if such fields exist , at least for a region of the spacetime very close to the initial null hypersurface @xmath6 .",
    "the question of the convergence of the polyhomogeneous expansions of the zero - rest - mass fields discussed in the previous section will be addressed by posing a so - called asymptotic characteristic initial value problem , i.e. an initial value problem with initial data given on a future oriented null hypersurface ( a characteristic of the zero - rest - mass field equations ) , and on future null infinity ( which , by the way is also a characteristic of the field equations ) . once a suitable initial value problem has been posed , an existence result will be proven .",
    "this existence result will exhibit the convergence of the polyhomogeneous series .",
    "the aforesaid initial value problem is _ non - regular _ in a sense to be clarified later .",
    "hence the standard techniques used to prove existence results for analytic fields can not be directly used .",
    "some manipulations will have to be carried . in order to understand the rationale behind the forthcoming discussion , the standard regular problem is briefly reviewed .      under the tetrad choice described in the previous sections , the spin-1 zero rest - mass field equations ( aka source - free maxwell equations )",
    "are given by : @xmath99 recall that the zero - rest - mass fields are totally symmetric , and thus in our case @xmath100 .",
    "therefore the system ( [ m1])-([m4 ] ) is overdetermined : 4 equations for 3 complex components .",
    "this difficulty is overcome by discarding the last equation ( [ m4 ] ) .",
    "then , one has to verify that this equation is implied by the other ones if it held initially .",
    "this can be done by defining , @xmath101 using the field equations , the commutators and the ricci identities ( np field equations ) , it is not difficult to show that , @xmath102 thus , if equation ( [ m4 ] ) held initially , it will also held for later retarded times .    the principal part ( symbol ) of the reduced system ( [ m1])-([m3 ] ) is contained in the terms @xmath103 and can be written concisely in a matricial way as @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath108 whence the reduced system ( [ m1])-([m3 ] ) is clearly symmetric hyperbolic @xcite .",

    "this is the _",
    "asymptotic characteristic initial value problem_. alternatively one could give initial data on a past oriented null hypersurface @xmath112 and on @xmath109 and reconstruct the field on @xmath113 . for the sake of concreteness , here i will restrict to the first possibility .    from the structure of the principal part of the spin-1 zero - rest - mass field equations",
    ", one finds that the right way of setting such an _ asymptotic characteristic initial value problem _ for @xmath114 is set by prescribing :    1 .",
    "@xmath115 on @xmath6 , 2 .",
    "@xmath116 on @xmath8 , 3 .   and @xmath117 on @xmath10 .",

    "asymptotic characteristic initial value problem .",
    "furthermore , if the data on @xmath6 is analytic with respect to v , and the data on @xmath10 is analytic with respect to u , one can make use of duff @xcite and friedrich s techniques @xcite theorem and prove that there is a unique analytic ( @xmath120 ) solution to the posed initial value problem .",
    "the idea behind the proof is to construct another system of partial differential equations whose solutions can be shown to exist , be analytic and with an expansion that majorises the formal series solutions of the original system of equations .",
    "this implies the analyticity ( and existence ) of the solutions . in order to implement this construction the different terms in the equations",
    "are required to be analytic as well .",
    "the duff - friedrich s construction works for quasilinear equations . here",
    ", the situation is much simpler as the zero - rest - mass field equations are linear .",
    "further refinements can be implemented in order to show existence for the case when the initial data is @xmath121 rather than analytic @xcite .",
    "in such a case the field is found to be @xmath121 . however , these further results may not concern us here .",
    "so much for the so - called regular initial value problem .",
    "what happens if the initial data over @xmath6 is non - peeling , like for instance @xmath122 ?",
    "as discussed elsewhere @xcite , such initial data gives rise to logarithms in the asymptotic expansions of the remaining components of the zero - rest - mass field spinor @xmath114 , and in @xmath115 itself for later times , even in the case where the logarithmic terms were not present in the initial data .",
    "an initial value problem with this kind of data that is not bounded at @xmath10 , and henceforth it will be called _ non - regular_.    in the case that concerns us here , that of a minimally polyhomogeneous spin-1 zero - rest - mass field , the non - regular nature of @xmath115 and @xmath116 at @xmath10 precludes us from setting an initial value problem as the one discussed above , and using directly duff and friedrich s techniques .",
    "assume for a moment that we have a polyhomogeneous spin-1 zero - rest - mass field .",
    "due to the absolute convergence of the formal series expansion , one can reshuffle the terms and write : @xmath123 where the coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 are completely logarithm free !",
    "asymptotically one has that @xmath126 and that @xmath127 for the other auxiliary field .",
    "thus , upon substitution on the field equations ( [ m1])-([m3 ] ) , one obtains the following equations for the _ auxiliary field _ , @xmath128 which are in fact identical to the spin-1 zero - rest - mass field equations ( [ m1])-([m4 ] ) .",
    "again , the system is overdetermined , and thus one discards the last equation .    in an ordinary asymptotic characteristic initial value problem ,",
    "the initial data over @xmath6 is prescribed , that is @xmath129 is given .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath130 at @xmath6 is also known .",
    "furthermore , as seen before @xmath131 , and therefore we also know the value of @xmath132 at @xmath7 .",
    "finally , as discussed previously,@xmath133 , and therefore @xmath134 on @xmath10 , i.e. the field is non - radiative . has no type n term .",
    "thus , it does not contribute to the poynting vector and consequently no energy loss can be ascribed to it ! ] consequently , we are are in the possession of all the ingredients needed to set an asymptotic characteristic value problem for the spin-1 zero - rest - mass field @xmath135 .",
    "the initial data has been constructed out of the ( non - regular ) initial data for the original spin-1 zero - rest - mass field @xmath114 .",
    "duff and friedrich s techniques allows us to state that there is an ( unique ) analytic solution for this initial value problem in a neighbourhood of @xmath7 .    what happens with the other auxiliary field ?",
    "in this case the equations are , @xmath136 note the presence of the extra terms @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "thus the auxiliary field @xmath139 satisfies a kind of sourced maxwell equations .",
    "the source happens to be precisely the vacuum field @xmath135 .",
    "as it has been done before , one discards the last equation ( [ m40 ] ) .    from a previous analysis",
    ", one knows that @xmath133 , and thus the whole new term in equation ( [ m30 ] ) is such that @xmath140 .",
    "hence , it is regular at @xmath10 .",
    "however , duff and friedrich s techniques can not be applied to the reduced system ( [ m10])-([m30 ] ) , as it is , for the initial data over the initial hypersurface @xmath6 is not regular .    as discussed , @xmath141 .",
    "substitution of this into equation ( [ m10 ] ) yields , @xmath142 therefore , the non - regular term is a constant of motion @xcite .",
    "let @xmath143 , with @xmath144 , i.e. from a physical spacetime point of view the component @xmath144 satisfies the peeling behaviour .",
    "substitution into equations ( [ m1])-([m3 ] ) yields , @xmath145 now , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the new extra terms @xmath149 and @xmath150 are regular at @xmath10 and known .",
    "moreover , they are also analytic at @xmath27 . therefore we have obtained a perfectly regular symmetric hyperbolic system for @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , we also know the value of @xmath151 at the initial hypersurface @xmath6 ( obtainable from the non - regular initial value problem for @xmath114 ) . the value of @xmath154 at @xmath7 is also known .",
    "finally @xmath155 , and thus we also know the data on @xmath10 . consequently we have obtained a regular system of symmetric hyperbolic equations for the scalars @xmath151 , @xmath154 , @xmath153 with suitable initial data on which duff and friedrich s ideas can be used .",
    "the conclusion is that there exists a neighbourhood of @xmath7 on which there exists an ( unique ) analytic solution ( @xmath120 ) to the posed initial value problem .",
    "if @xmath151 is analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath10 then clearly @xmath156 has a convergent laurent expansion on the same neighbourhood .",
    "so , we have seen that there exists a neighbourhood @xmath157 of @xmath7 for which the field @xmath135 is analytic ( in @xmath25 ) , and another neighbourhood @xmath158 for which the field @xmath139 has a laurent expansion ( again in @xmath25 ) .",
    "let @xmath159 .",
    "thus , one can say that the non - regular asymptotic characteristic initial value problem for the zero - rest - mass field @xmath160 has a ( unique ) solution in @xmath161 which is in fact polyhomogeneous .",
    "note that althought the field is not well defined at @xmath10 , the radiation field is well defined ( @xmath117 ) as it is part of the regular initial data .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that the net electromagnetic charge of the field ( as measured from null infinity ) is also well defined .",
    "these results can be sumarised in the form of the following    let @xmath3 be a ricci flat ( @xmath162 ) asymptotically simple spacetime , and let @xmath4 be the corresponding unphysical spacetime obtained by the conformal rescaling .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath6 be a future oriented null hypersurface in @xmath37 that intersects @xmath10 at @xmath7 .",
    "then there exist a neighbourhood @xmath163 of @xmath7 such that the non - regular asymptotic characteristic initial value problem for a spin-1 zero - rest - mass field with minimally polyhomogeneous data on @xmath6 has a unique ( polyhomogeneous ) solution in @xmath161 .",
    "an existence result for the asymptotic characteristic initial value problem for a spin-1 zero - rest - mass field with polyhomogeneous initial data has been proved .",
    "the polyhomogeneous initial data is not bounded at @xmath10 , and thus , the initial value problem is non - regular .",
    "this means essentially that standard existence theorems for symmetric hyperbolic equations can not be directly used .",
    "however , as seen it possible to reformulate this non - regular initial value problem as two coupled initial value problems for some auxiliary fields .",
    "these auxiliary fields satisfy partial differential equations with regular initial data . moreover , these auxiliary systems have the same principal part ( symbol ) as the spin-1 zero - rest - mass field .",
    "the existence result shows that the polyhomogeneous structure of the initial data is preserved at least in a neighbourhood of @xmath7 . and",
    "for the same price , one also settles the matter of the convergence of polyhomogeneous expansions for zero - rest - mass fields .",
    "the proof given here is limited to minimally polyhomogeneous spin-1 zero - rest - mass field equations .",
    "a proof for an arbitrary polyhomogeneous spin-2 zero - rest - mass field ( higher spins are not so interesting as the buchdahl constraint has to be satisfied ) follows using the same techniques .",
    "arbitrary polyhomogeneity in the initial data means that further auxiliary fields and their respective systems should be included in the discussion .",
    "as it has been pointed out elsewhere , these auxiliary fields form a hierarchy .",
    "this hierarchy is such that the field equations for a given auxiliary field has the auxiliary field just above in the hierarchy as source term ( cfr . with the equations for @xmath135 and @xmath139 ) .",
    "the consideration of a spin-2 field rather than a spin-1 one would only increase the amount of algebra involved .",
    "a much more interesting and natural extension of this work is to trying to apply similar techniques to polyhomogeneous gravitational fields .",
    "this would require the use of friedrich s regular conformal field equations , and a good understanding of the formal polyhomogeneous solutions to the aforementioned equations .",
    "these concerns will be and are the concern of future work .",
