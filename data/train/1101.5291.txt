    "radio and x - ray observations show that in majority of regular galaxy clusters , possessing a cool core , the activity of a central supermassive black hole mediated by agn jets creates bubbles of relativistic plasma in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) @xcite .",
    "x - ray data are consistent with the assumption that bubbles are completely devoid of thermal gas @xcite although the limits on the amount of thermal gas in the bubbles are not very tight .",
    "the absence of strong shocks in the icm surrounding the bubbles implies that the relativistic plasma is in approximate pressure equilibrium with the icm .",
    "these bubbles , inflated by an agn , are believed to be responsible for mechanical coupling of the agn energy release and the thermal state of the icm in galaxy clusters , groups and individual elliptical galaxies .",
    "for this reason every aspect of bubble physics receives much attention .",
    "given the ubiquity of bubbles in clusters , these objects should be almost always present in the cluster core .",
    "the lifetime of the bubble in the stratified atmosphere is set by `` buoyancy '' time , while the growth rate of the bubble is defined by the power of the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pairs of bubbles are located on both sides of the central supermassive black hole and often several generation of bubbles differing in their size and the distance from the center are observed .",
    "bubbles with sizes of order 1 - 10 kpc are often found in the inner regions of galaxy clusters , sharing the space with brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "for example , in ngc 1275",
    "( bcg of perseus cluster ) within the effective radius of the galaxy ( @xmath015 kpc ) we see two bubbles on either side of the nucleus with the radius of each bubble @xmath1 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in m 87 ( virgo cluster )",
    "the bubble radius is @xmath2 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the galaxy effective radius is of order 7.7 kpc .",
    "we expect that in both cases bubbles should contain significant fraction of the galaxy stars .",
    "these old low mass stars evolve as usual , lose their mass via the wind , and some of them give birth to type ia supernovae ( sneia ) . even if the relativistic bubble sweeps up all the thermal gas in the process of inflation a lot of material in the form of the stellar wind",
    "thus can be supplied by the stars _ inside the bubble _ during the bubble life .",
    "this wind material could affect the expansion dynamics of supernovae exploded in the bubble .",
    "the question we address here is what happens to the stellar winds and snia ejecta embedded in the relativistic bubble .",
    "almost weightless relativistic plasma provides highly unusual conditions for the dynamic evolution of wind shells and sne .",
    "two extreme scenarios are conceivable . in one limit all the wind material and sn ejecta are decelerated and mixed with relativistic plasma . during subsequent evolution the buoyantly rising bubbles advect this material with them . in another limit",
    "the matter ejected by evolving stars propagates freely through the relativistic plasma , attains the boundaries of the bubble and enriches the icm just outside the bubble with heavy elements .",
    "we investigate different scenarios of dynamical evolution of wind shells and sn ejecta and explore observational outcomes of these scenarios .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first study the expansion and bulk motion of the wind envelopes including mass striping effects .",
    "this provides us with the estimate of the filling factor of the wind shells ensemble .",
    "we then address the issue of the sn envelope expansion dynamics and bulk motion , rayleigh - taylor fragmentation of the sn shell and propagation of ejecta fragments in the relativistic plasma .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of results for the relativistic bubble matter contents and intracluster thermal environment .",
    "we consider , as a fiducial model , a spherical bubble of radius @xmath3 kpc with the bubble center at the distance @xmath4 from the center of the bcg .",
    "the characteristic age of this bubble is @xmath5 yr , where we adopt the bubble rise velocity @xmath6 km s@xmath7 ( cf .",
    "at the radii @xmath8 kpc the stellar component in massive elliptical galaxies dominates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its density distribution can be approximated by the singular isothermal sphere with the velocity dispersion @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is gravitational constant and @xmath12 is a radial scale . adopting @xmath13 kpc and velocity dispersion @xmath14 km s@xmath7",
    "@xcite one gets the stellar mass @xmath15 .",
    "this value is consistent with estimates of the total mass of stellar component of bcg of @xmath16 . inside the bubble of radius @xmath3 kpc",
    "the stellar mass in this case is @xmath17 , where @xmath18/(5 kpc ) .",
    "the stars are presumably old with an age of @xmath19 yr , which suggests that the current upper limit of the stellar mass at the agb stage is @xmath20 @xcite . assuming the salpeter initial mass function @xmath21 within the range @xmath22 one gets the normalizing factor @xmath23^{-1}=0.28m_s\\ , , \\label{eq - normf}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are used .",
    "the star of @xmath27 leaves behind a white dwarf of @xmath28 @xcite , while @xmath29 is lost in the form of slow ( @xmath30 km s@xmath7 ) wind during the thermally pulsing agb stage @xcite . the present day integrated rate of the wind matter injection into the relativistic bubble is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rate at which upper limit @xmath33 decreases with time .",
    "this rate is determined by the relation between the lifetime and initial star mass @xmath34 , where @xmath35 in the range of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "for these values and @xmath37 the equation ( [ eq - dotmw ] ) yields @xmath38 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding stellar death rate is @xmath39 yr@xmath7 which is also the rate of wind shell formation @xmath40 .",
    "one expect thus to find @xmath41 newly created wind envelopes in the bubble volume with the total amount of the wind matter in the bubble of @xmath42 , factor @xmath43 larger than the mass in the form of relativistic particles of the bubble , @xmath44 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the @xmath45 estimate ignores so far a possible escape of wind envelopes from the bubble , which is addressed below .      the dynamical effect of the wind matter in the bubble on a certain wind shell or sn ejecta depends on the filling and covering factors of wind shells .",
    "to assess the situation one needs first to find the average volume and size of a wind envelope at the final stage of its expansion .",
    "here we assume that the bubble is static and adopt that a star moves with the mean velocity @xmath46 . despite a singular isothermal sphere",
    "is assumed for the stellar population , it is reasonable to estimate @xmath46 using maxwell velocity distribution truncated at the escape velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the truncated maxwell distribution is taken in the form proposed by @xcite : @xmath48 $ ] for @xmath49 and @xmath50 otherwise . adopting @xmath14 km s@xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath51 km s@xmath7 we come to the average velocity @xmath52 km s@xmath7 .    the geometry of the wind shell that forms as a result of the interaction of the wind with the relativistic medium depends on the value of the drag force exerted on the wind boundary .",
    "if the drag force is strong the stripped wind material creates a trailing plume . on the other hand ,",
    "if drag force is very weak , then the wind shell moves with the star velocity retaining spherically - symmetric shape and eventually may escape the relativistic bubble . to explore this issue",
    "we consider major stages of the mass loss at the agb and post - agb stage : @xcite : ( 1 ) the slow wind ( @xmath53 km s@xmath7 , @xmath54 yr@xmath7 ) on the time scale of the agb stage , i.e. , @xmath55 yr , ( 2 ) slow superwind ( @xmath56 yr@xmath7 ) during the last @xmath43 yr of the agb stage , and ( 3 ) fast wind at the post - agb stage which corresponds to the planetary nebula ( pn ) stage ( @xmath43 yr ) .",
    "the last stage practically does not contribute to the mass loss , but turns out essential for the acceleration of the slow wind .",
    "we adopt that 60% of the hydrogen shell is lost at the first stage and 40% at the superwind stage @xcite , which implies the mass - loss rates @xmath57 yr@xmath7 at the slow wind stage and @xmath58 yr@xmath7 at the superwind stage . for the fast wind stage",
    "we adopt parameters derived from the modelling of the x - ray emission of the pn : @xmath59 yr@xmath7 and @xmath60 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the fast wind parameters suggest that the total kinetic energy released during this stage ( @xmath43 yr ) is @xmath61 erg . when transfered to the slow wind shell with the mass of @xmath62 this energy accelerates the shell up to @xmath63 km s@xmath7 , in accord with the expansion velocities of evolved pn @xcite .",
    "the mass striping rate of the wind shell scales as the shell radius squared , so at the stage of slow wind the maximal stripping is attained at the end of this stage .",
    "the radius of the wind shell at this age can be estimated from the energy arguments .",
    "the kinetic energy of the wind shell is spent on the @xmath64 work against external pressure @xmath65 and on the internal energy which results in the stopping radius of the wind shell @xmath66^{1/3 } = 0.19p_{10}^{-1/3}~~\\mbox{pc}\\ , , \\label{eq - rwind}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 km s@xmath7 , and @xmath70 are used .",
    "the wind shell moves as a whole together with the white dwarf unless the bulk of the material is stripped into the trailing plume .",
    "the wind shell stripping can be estimated following @xcite consideration of the gas stipping for a galaxy moving in the icm .",
    "the turbulent stripping is determined by the combined effect of the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) and the ram pressure drag .",
    "indeed , khi broadens the boundary layer which results in the supression of the khi . the net stripping rate , therefore , is controlled by the ram pressure @xmath71 where we use @xmath72 for the density of ambient medium .",
    "the average residence time of a wind shell in the bubble is @xmath73  yr , so the above mass loss rate implies that the wind shell loses @xmath74 while moving in the bubble , negligibly small amount compared to the mass of the wind shell , @xmath75 .",
    "alternatively , the stripping could be caused by the alfven wave drag . in this regard",
    "we note that the infinite conductivity approximation for the wind shell is fully applicable . a conducting body moving with velocity @xmath76 across the magnetic field @xmath77 experiences the drag force due to alfven wave generation @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the area of lateral surface perpendicular to @xmath80",
    ", @xmath81 is the alfven velocity , @xmath82 with @xmath72 . strictly speaking ,",
    "the alfven velocity in the relativisic plasma @xcite is smaller compared to this expression by a factor of 0.7 - 0.9 depending on the ratio of magnetic to total pressure ; we neglect this difference . for a sphere of the radius @xmath83",
    "the lateral area is @xmath84 and the mass stripping rate caused by the alfven wave drag is @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "the stripping rate due to the alfven drag thus turns out two orders of magnitude larger than the rate according to equation ( [ eq - dotm ] ) . yet",
    "even for the alfven drag the mass lost during the residence time is only @xmath87 which is a small fraction ( @xmath88% ) of the wind shell .",
    "we thus conclude that the wind shell lost at the slow wind stage remains almost intact while traveling across the bubble .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for the superwind stage .",
    "the outcome of a combined effect of all three stages of the mass loss is a spherical wind shell of @xmath62 expanding with the velocity of 30 km s@xmath7 . using equation ( [ eq - rwind ] )",
    "one finds the wind shell stopping radius is @xmath89 pc .",
    "the above treatment of the wind dynamics suggests that the cosmic rays diffusion into the shell can be neglected . to check whether this assumption is valid we assume bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the proton giroradius .",
    "this assumption is standard for the analysis of cosmic ray propagation and supported by observational data on the cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants @xcite , although the concept of a tangled field might seriously modify a picture of the cosmic ray diffusion in magnetic field @xcite . for the spectral index of relativistic protons",
    "@xmath92 the energy of cosmic rays resides in low energy protons , which permits us to use the characteristic energy of relativistic protons @xmath93 gev . with @xmath94 g one gets @xmath95 cm .",
    "the diffusion time is then @xmath96 where @xmath97 . for the slow wind stage with the final radius of @xmath98",
    "pc the diffusion time is comparable to the duration of this stage ( @xmath99 yr ) , while the life time of superwind and fast wind stages is significantly smaller than the diffusion time .",
    "the estimated time scale of the cosmic ray diffusion suggests that the penetration of cosmic rays in the wind can affect the wind expansion dynamics at the slow wind stage making the pressure gradient smoother and the deceleration less pronounced . as a result",
    ", the final radius of the wind shell at the slow wind stage in fact could be somewhat larger , @xmath100 pc .",
    "on the other hand , the effect can not be significant because the diffution time increases @xmath101 , so the role of the cosmic ray diffusion rapidly drops for larger radius .",
    "we conclude therefore that the stopping radius of the wind shell ( @xmath102 pc ) , which includes the combined effect of agb and post agb mass loss and omits the cosmic ray diffusion , is a reasonable estimate .      outside the relativistic bubble",
    "the wind shell turns out in the intracluster thermal gas . for the mass stripping rate @xmath103 adopting the wind shell radius @xmath104 cm , number density of interstellar gas @xmath105 @xmath106 , and @xmath52 km s@xmath7 one obtains @xmath107 yr@xmath7 . it takes @xmath108 yr to completely strip the @xmath62 wind shell over the distance of @xmath109 kpc .",
    "the same estimate can be obtained from the equation of deceleration of the wind shell as a whole by drag force @xmath110 .",
    "the wind shell escaping bubble is decelerated thus in a close vicinity of the bubble boundary .",
    "the average residence time of the wind shell in the bubble @xmath111 yr is somewhat smaller than the age of the fiducial bubble @xmath112",
    "yr . the total amount of the wind shells residing in the bubble is , therefore , @xmath113 , while the filling factor of the ensemble of wind shells in the bubble is @xmath114 the probability of a collision with the wind shell is determined by the ratio of the bubble radius and the mean free path .",
    "the latter is @xmath115 where @xmath116 pc@xmath117 is the number density of wind shells .",
    "the probability of shell collisions is low , because the average number of wind shells along the bubble radius is only @xmath118 .",
    "the average probability of the collision is approximately @xmath119\\approx\\tau=0.08 $ ] . more accurate",

    "most of wind shells therefore escape the bubble freely and only 6% of wind shells collide with another shell .",
    "the fate of the collided wind shells depends on whether the collision is adiabatic or radiative . with the average relative velocity of collision @xmath123 km s@xmath7 and the wind shell density",
    "@xmath124 @xmath106 the estimated cooling time of the shocked gas turnes out to be @xmath125 s , comparable with the hydrodynamic scale @xmath126 s. this means that both adiabatic and radiative collision regimes are plausible .",
    "in the adiabatic case wind shells approximately retain their sizes and absolute velocities , so the adiabatic collision does not affect their escape .",
    "in radiative case collided shells merge and form thin dense pancake of a thickness @xmath127 and density @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the density of the wind shell before collision , this pancake is liable to fragmentation into clumps of size @xmath130 and average velocity @xmath131 .",
    "it is easy to verify that for fragments with sizes @xmath130 and density @xmath128 the stripping ( or deceleration ) time is greater than the stripping time of wind shells .",
    "we thus conclude that the most of the wind material escapes into the hot icm .",
    "in our analysis of the wind shell dynamics we ignored a possible fragmentation of the wind shell due to the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability on the deceleration or acceleration stages .",
    "this omission facilitates the consideration ; yet it does not affect the major conclusion that the wind shell material escape the relativistic bubble . as we will see below , the rt fragmentation favours the shell matter escape .",
    "with snia production efficiency @xmath132 per one white dwarf formed in the stellar population of e - galaxies @xcite and the stellar death rate in the bubble of fiducial model @xmath133 yr@xmath7 one expects @xmath134 snia explosions during the relativistic bubble lifetime @xmath135 yr .",
    "we now consider in detail sn expansion in the relativistic bubble and analyse an outcome of the rayleigh - taylor fragmentation of decelerating sn shell .          given a small number of wind shells along the bubble radius ( section [ sec - winesc ] ) the deceleration of the sn expansion in the relativistic bubble is probably dominated by the pressure of the relativistic fluid .",
    "indeed , for sn expanding with the characteristic velocity @xmath136 cm s@xmath7 one readily sees that the ram pressure is small compared to the pressure of relativistic fluid : @xmath137 .",
    "the crucial role of the external relativistic pressure in the sn deceleration is a distinguishing feature compared to the standard case of sn shell in the ordinary interstellar medium .    in our analysis of the sn expansion we assume the isotropic pressure of the relativistic medium .",
    "this is the case , if the mean free path for relativistic protons along the magnetic field is much less than the sn radius .",
    "since the sn expands subsonically relative to the external medium , in which the sound speed is @xmath138 , the strong forward shock does not form . the reverse shock obviously forms , because outer layers of ejecta are decelerated by the external pressure and the velocity jump between the undisturbed ejecta and swept - up shell exceeds the sound speed in the unshocked ejecta ( @xmath139 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the sn is fully decelerated when the reverse shock crosses the bulk of the ejecta mass .    to estimate the stopping radius of sn one can use the energy considerations likewise we did for the wind shell expansion .",
    "the initial kinetic energy @xmath140 of sn should be spent on the @xmath141 work against the external pressure and on the internal energy @xmath142 which gives the stopping radius @xmath143^{1/3}=36p_{10}^{-1/3}~~\\mbox{pc}\\ , .",

    "the dynamics of the swept - up shell and the x - ray emission of the reverse shock can be illustrated using a model based on a thin shell approximation .",
    "this suggests that the shell formed by ejecta material flowing into the reverse shock is considered as a thin shell which dynamics is governed by the dynamical pressure of the sn ejecta and external pressure @xmath147 erg @xmath106 .",

    "the maximal radius of the thin shell model is 39 pc , slightly larger than analytical estimate @xmath155 pc .",
    "remarkably , the thin shell shows contraction phase ( fig .",
    "1a ) which is a direct outcome of the dynamical role of the external pressure . however , since we neglect the internal pressure of the shocked envelope , the amplitude of the contraction phase in our model is exaggerated , so we stop the computations at this phase . to calculate the x - ray emission we assume that the hot plasma in the shell is distributed homogeneously in the shell with the thickness @xmath156 .",
    "it is rather a crude approximation because the density distribution in the reverse shock is expected to be essentially inhomogeneous with a peak at the contact surface .",
    "yet it is reasonable enough to get an idea about x - ray luminosity within a factor of two .",
    "the luminosity is maximal at the contraction phase and reaches @xmath157 erg s@xmath7 at the shock temperature of @xmath124 kev .",

    ", one finds that rt spike can travel @xmath203 kpc , rather small distance compared to the bubble radius .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argues that the increase of the width of the boundary layer due to the khi quenches the very instability . as a result",
    "the mass loss is suppressed and eventually is defined by the momentum transfer [ cf .",
    "equations ( [ eq - dotm ] ) and ( [ eq - dotma ] ) ] . in this case",
    "the problem of mass stripping due to khi is reduced to the problem of a deceleration of rt spikes which is analysed in the next section .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field also can suppress the khi .",
    "let @xmath204 and @xmath205 be the density of rarefied and dense fluid . according to the criterion of the khi in the presence of magnetic field @xcite the condition that the magnetic field turns off the khi is @xmath206 where @xmath147 erg @xmath106 , @xmath207 is the light speed , and @xmath208 cm s@xmath7 are used .",
    "the required magnetic field @xmath209  g is within the range of field strength in the relativistic bubble , which can be as large as several @xmath210 g. the magnetic stabilization of rt spikes against khi thus seems quite plausible .",
    "hereafter we address the deceleration of rt spike assuming its stability .",
    "a typical rt spike is assumed to be a cylinder with the mass @xmath211 , radius @xmath193 , and length @xmath212 , which are assumed to remain constant .",
    "the rt spike pesumably moves along the axis in the relativistic plasma dominated by the relativistic particles . with the giroradius @xmath95 cm and the rt spike radius @xmath213 cm",
    "only a motion along the regular magnetic field can be collisionless .",
    "the mean free path for relativistic protons propagating along the field can be constrained by scattering on the perpendicular component of a random field .",
    "the resulting mean free path along the mean field @xmath77 is @xmath214 @xcite , where @xmath215 is the amplitude of a random field with resonance wave number @xmath216 .",
    "following @xcite we assume the power law spectrum of random field energy density @xmath217 with @xmath218 , between maximal length scale @xmath219 and and minimal scale @xmath220 .",
    "the integrated energy density is normalized according to suggestion by @xcite : @xmath221 . with these prerequisites",
    "one gets @xmath222 and @xmath223 cm , i.e. , @xmath224 .",
    "the situation thus is about collisionless , although uncertainties of the relevant parameters do not preclude collisional regime as well .",
    "one needs therefore to consider both collisionless and collisional cases .",
    "for @xmath225 the moment exchange occurs primarily via the cosmic ray collisions with the lateral surface of the spike .",
    "the momentum transferred to the colliding particle with the energy @xmath140 assuming diffusive reflection , is @xmath226 .",
    "for the particle flux on the unit of surface area @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the cosmic ray concentration , the moment transferred per second to all the striking protons ( drag force ) is @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the energy density of relativistic particles .",
    "note that the drag force could be derived also using average energy gain of a relativistic particle per collision with the cloud @xmath231 @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a spherical cloud the total energy loss per second in that case is @xmath232 .",
    "this implies the drag force @xmath233 , which coincides with the above expression for @xmath234 within the geometrical factor .",
    "the equation of motion of the spike in the collisionless case with the above value of @xmath234 then reads @xmath235 we neglect here the head - on collisions which would contribute the term of the order @xmath236 in the right hand side .",
    "note , the transition from spike to the spherical blob corresponds to @xmath237 in the drag force expression .",
    "the characteristic time of the spike deceleration is thus @xmath238 the ratio @xmath239 can be expressed via the surface density of the sn shell at the stopping radius as @xmath240 , where the parameter @xmath241 because the spike is formed by a shell patch with the radius @xmath242 .",
    "the deceleration distance for the spike is then @xmath243 where we make use of equation ( [ eq - rstop ] ) and adopt @xmath208 cm s@xmath7 and @xmath155 pc . for @xmath244 and @xmath245",
    "the spike can travel @xmath109 kpc before it gets completely decelerated . in collisionless case",
    "the rt fragments are decelerated efficiently inside the relativistic bubble .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the collisionless regime can be realized only in the case of the motion along the magnetic field so , only a small fraction of rt spikes experiences this type of a deceleration .",
    "if the mean free path for cosmic ray protons is small @xmath246 , one expects that the drag force should be proportional to @xmath247 . the general condition for that is the large reynolds number re@xmath248 . to estimate re we adopt the spike radius @xmath213 cm , the spike velocity @xmath208 cm , and @xmath249 as the mean free path for relativistic protons .",
    "assuming @xmath94 g , i.e. , @xmath95 cm one gets re@xmath250 . the condition re@xmath248 thus is fulfilled for @xmath251 cm , which is rather soft requirement .    in the collisional approximation",
    "the drag force is @xmath252 . following the recipe of the previous section one obtains the spike deceleration distance @xmath253 for @xmath208 cm s@xmath7 and @xmath155 pc one obtains @xmath254 kpc , rather large value that exceeds bubble radius ( 5 kpc ) even for modest value of @xmath255 .",
    "the ram pressure drag thus almost does not decelerate rt spikes inside the relativistic bubble .",
    "the alfven wave drag can operate for the large conducting body @xmath256 cm , which is easily met for rt spikes . using the expression for",
    "the power radiated in the form of alfven waves @xcite ) one can write the alfven drag force acting on the plasma spike with the radius @xmath193 and length @xmath212 as @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the alfven velocity .",
    "note , it is only the lateral surface area ( @xmath259 ) , that matters .",
    "following arguments of the previous sections one gets the spike deceleration distance @xmath260 for fiducial model @xmath147 erg @xmath106 , @xmath94 g , @xmath208 cm s@xmath7 one obtains @xmath261 kpc .",
    "this result shows that in case @xmath262 the blob can travel the distance exceeding the radius of the relativistic bubble even for moderate values of @xmath263 . for a long spike ( @xmath225 ) deceleration",
    "is by factor @xmath264 stronger and the deceleration distance is accordingly shorter . for @xmath265 and @xmath266",
    "the rt spike can travel @xmath267 kpc , a distance comparable with the adopted bubble radius @xmath3 kpc .",
    "it takes roughly @xmath268 yr for the spike to reach the the bubble boundary assuming the spike average velocity of @xmath167 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the effect of the alfven wave drag is determined by the magnetic field .",
    "if the field is weak , @xmath269 g , the deceleration distance is @xmath270 kpc , substantially larger than the bubble radius . on the other hand , for @xmath271 g",
    "the deceleration distance is smaller than the bubble radius and significan amount of rt fragments will remain in the relativistic bubble .",
    "the escape probability for rt spike in case of @xmath94 g can be estimated adopting mean free path @xmath272 kpc , i.e. , @xmath273 . equation ( [ eq - oster ] ) gives in this case the escape probability @xmath274 .",
    "the average number of wind shells along the average distance to the bubble boundary for the fiducial model is @xmath275 ( section [ sec - windyn ] ) which means that for sn fragments the probability to collide with a wind shell is low , @xmath276 .",
    "a question arises , what happens , anyway , if the collision takes place .",
    "the deceleration is determined by the ratio of column densities ( @xmath277 ) of the projectile ( rt spike ) and target ( wind shell ) . for the wind shell @xmath278 where @xmath104 cm and @xmath279 are used . the column density of the spike @xmath280 g @xmath281 .",
    "this comparison shows that the spike will be fully decelerated in a single collision with a wind shell .",

    "the aim of this paper has been to get an idea on what happens to the matter ejected by the stellar population of bcg embedded into a bubble of relativistic plasma .",
    "we have found that the expansion of a wind envelope lost by a star is stopped by the pressure of the relativistic fluid when the radius attains @xmath291 pc .",
    "because of the small size of the wind shell its bulk motion is not decelerated neither by the ram pressure , nor by the alfven wave drag , so the shell escapes the bubble together with the parent star .",
    "the sn  ia exploding in the relativistic fluid expands up to much larger radius @xmath292 pc and its bulk motion can be efficiently decelerated by the alfven wave drag .",
    "unless a rt instability operates , the sn material would not escape the relativistic bubble , but will instead be advected by the buoyantly rising relativistic fluid .",
    "the rt instability can strongly modify the behavior of the ejecta . in the framework of our fiducial model",
    "we find that significant fraction of sn fragments escapes the relativistic bubble . in our analysis of this scenario",
    "we rely on the fiducial model parameters outlined in table 1 .",
    "a gas lump crossing the bubble boundary and entering the icm is decelerated after sweeping the icm mass comparable with its own mass .",
    "the escaping wind shell gets decelerated in the thermal plasma of icm at the length of @xmath293 kpc ( section [ sec - windyn ] ) .",
    "the wind deposits @xmath294 in this layer . this value should be compared with the mass of the icm gas , which is already there . for @xmath3 kpc and hydrogen number density @xmath105",
    "@xmath106 the mass of the icm in the boundary layer with the thickness @xmath295 kpc is @xmath296 , i.e. , factor @xmath297 larger than the mass deposited by the wind shells .",
    "the deposited wind mass scales with the bubble radius as @xmath298 , whereas the icm mass in the layer is @xmath299 .",
    "we thus conclude that for the fiducial model the wind material escaping the relativistic bubble does not change significantly the density of the surrounding icm ; moreover the effect even smaller in case of m  87 in which bubble radius @xmath300 kpc .",
    "the effect of the energy deposition by the escaping wind shells is also negligible because the bulk velocities of the wind shells is subsonic and the deposited mass is low .",
    "the chemical composition of icm is not affected by the escaping wind shells either .    unlike the wind shells , fragments of sn ejecta escaping the relativistic bubble may have a profound effect on the enrichment of icm by iron peak elements .",
    "the resulting abundance is determined by the width of the mixing layer .",
    "generally , one should consider time - dependent model of the formation of mixing layer .",
    "however , we assume that the mixing layer in the fiducial model is formed by the cumulative effect of all sne . emploing the momentum conservation arguments a deceleration distance for the rt spike entering the icm with the velocity @xmath301 and decelerated down to",
    "@xmath302 turns out to be @xmath303 where we used @xmath304 , @xmath105 @xmath106 , @xmath305 , and @xmath155 pc . for @xmath306 one",
    "gets the deceleration length @xmath307 pc . at first glance",
    "the mixing layer could be identified with the deceleration layer .",
    "this layer contains @xmath308 of the icm gas .",
    "the mass produced by sn  ia during the life time of the bubble is @xmath309 .",
    "if most of the sn mass escapes the bubble , the amount of escaping iron in the mixing layer turns out to be @xmath310 which corresponds to the iron abundance @xmath311(solar ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the mixing layer could be broader because the total volume of shocked sn fragments in pressure equilibrium substantially exceeds the volume of the deceleration layer .",
    "simple estimate based upon the pressure equilibrium suggests the total volume occupied by shocked sn ejecta to be @xmath312 which implies the layer width @xmath313 pc . if this is identified with the width of the mixing layer than the iron abundance will be factor two larger compared to solar abundance of pre - existing icm .",
    "the increase of the iron abundance by factor two changes the 0.6 - 2 kev emissivity by factors of 1.8 , 1.5 and 1.3 for the gas temperatures 1 , 2 and 3 kev respectively .",
    "the latter estimates suggest complete mixing of injected iron with the icm , which may not be the case .",
    "the point is that the deceleration of sn fragments in the icm results in the strong heating of the ejecta material up to temperature corresponding to its kinetic energy .",
    "most of the iron therefore ends up in the high entropy / low density gas with the very little x - ray emission .",
    "the observational outcome thus critically depends on the mixing degree between hot sn gas and the relatively cool icm .",
    "the above picture of mixing layer is very crude and one can not rule out a possibility that the expanding relativistic bubble continuously catches up with the mixing layer outer boundary so that most of the decelerated sn material injected in the icm eventually turns out engulfed by the relativistic fluid .",
    "qualitatively this scenario then gets similar to the case when sn  ia ejecta bulk motion is decelerated well inside the bubble . in this case",
    "no strong x - ray emission is expected from fully expanded shells ( because of the very low gas density ) .",
    "the fate of the iron generated by sn  ia in this scenario solely depends on the evolution of relativistic plasma , which can escape the central region of the galaxy , as suggested by observations of e.g. m87 @xcite .",
    "we consider the outcome of the mass ejection by stars via winds and supernovae inside a bubble of relativistic plasma inflated by an agn in the core of bcg .",
    "wind shells are likely to escape the relativistic bubble and deposit their mass in the icm within @xmath109 kpc from the bubble boundary .",
    "sn  ia exploded inside the bubble is efficiently decelerated owing to the pressure of the relativistic fluid .",
    "if the sn shells remain spherical until the expansion of the envelope stops and do not fragment , then they would not escape the bubble . in this case the iron produced by sn  ia is advected by the relativistic plasma and may leave the central region of the bcg together with buoyantly moving bubbles .    as a possibility we consider a scenario in which the rt instability of the sn envelope at the deceleration phase breaks the shell into multitude of rt spikes .",
    "the analysis of the deceleration of rt spikes in the relativistic fluid shows that the sn fragments are able to escape the bubble .",
    "the fragments are decelerated in the icm in a close vicinity of the bubble boundary thus producing fe - rich layer . in the optimistic scenario",
    "this fe - rich layer can enhance x - ray emission around bubbles of relativistic plasma , producing bright rims around bubbles .",
