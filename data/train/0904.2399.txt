    "in the last decade , many studies have been made for the nonextensive statistics @xcite in which the generalized entropy ( the tsallis entropy ) is introduced ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the tsallis entropy is a one - parameter generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy with the entropic index @xmath2 : the tsallis entropy in the limit of @xmath3 reduces to the boltzmann - gibbs entropy .",
    "the optimum probability distribution or density matrix is obtained with the maximum entropy method ( mem ) for the tsallis entropy with some constraints . at the moment",
    ", there are four possible mems : original method @xcite , un - normalized method @xcite , normalized method @xcite , and the optimal lagrange multiplier ( olm ) method @xcite .",
    "the four methods are equivalent in the sense that distributions derived in them are easily transformed each other @xcite .",
    "a comparison among the four mems is made in ref .",
    "the nonextensive statistics has been successfully applied to a wide class of subjects in physics , chemistry , information science , biology and economics @xcite .",
    "one of alternative approaches to the nonextensive statistics besides the mem is the superstatistics @xcite ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) . in the superstatistics",
    ", it is assumed that locally the equilibrium state is described by the boltzmann - gibbs statistics and that their global properties may be expressed by a superposition over the intensive parameter ( _ i.e. , _ the inverse temperature ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is , however , not clear how to obtain the mixing probability distribution of fluctuating parameter from first principles .",
    "this problem is currently controversial and some attempts to this direction have been proposed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the concept of the superstatistics has been applied to many kinds of subjects such as hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , cosmic ray @xcite and solar flares @xcite .",
    "the nonextensive statistics has been applied to both classical and quantum systems . in this paper",
    ", we pay attention to quantum nonextensive systems .",
    "the generalized bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distributions in nonextensive systems ( referred to as @xmath2-bed and @xmath2-fdd hereafter ) have been discussed by the three methods .",
    "( i ) the asymptotic approximation ( aa ) was proposed by tsallis , sa barreto and loh @xcite who derived the expression for the canonical partition function valid for @xmath4 .",
    "it has been applied to the black - body radiation @xcite , early universe @xcite and the bose - einstein condensation @xcite@xcite .",
    "( ii ) the factorization approximation ( fa ) was proposed by bykkilic , demirhan and glec @xcite to evaluate the grand canonical partition function .",
    "the fa was criticized in @xcite@xcite , but supported in @xcite , related discussion being given in sec .",
    "the simple expressions for @xmath2-bed and @xmath2-fdd in the fa have been adopted in many applications such as the black - body radiation @xcite , early universe @xcite , the bose - einstein condensation @xcite-@xcite , metals @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , spin systems @xcite-@xcite and metallic ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the exact approach ( ea ) was developed by rajagopal , mendes and lenzi @xcite who derived the formally exact integral representation for the grand canonical partition function of nonextensive systems which is expressed in terms of the boltzmann - gibbs counterpart .",
    "the integral representation approach originated from the hilhorst formula @xcite .",
    "because an actual evaluation of a given integral is generally difficult , it may be performed in an approximate way @xcite or in the limited cases @xcite .",
    "the validity of the ea is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the ea has been applied to nonextensive quantum systems such as black body radiation @xcite and the bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "we believe that it is important and valuable to pursue the ea despite its difficulty .",
    "it is the purpose of the present study to apply the ea @xcite to calculations of the generalized distributions of @xmath2-bed and @xmath2-fdd .",
    "the grand canonical partition function of the nonextensive systems is derived with the use of the olm scheme in the mem @xcite .",
    "self - consistent equations for averages of the number of particles and energy and the grand - canonical partition function are exactly expressed by the integral representation @xcite . the integral representation for @xmath5 in the ea",
    "is expressed as an integral along the real axis , while that for @xmath6 is expressed as the contour integral in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 expansion by the ea agrees with the result derived by the aa . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the self - consistent equations have been numerically solved with the band model for electrons and the debye model for phonon .",
    "it is rather difficult and tedious to obtain the generalized distributions in the ea because they need the self - consistent calculation of averages of number of particles and energy .",
    "based on the exact result obtained , we have proposed the _ interpolation approximation _ ( ia ) to @xmath2-bed and @xmath2-fdd , which do not need the self - consistently determined quantities and whose results are in agreement with those of the ea within @xmath1 and in high- and low - temperature limits .",
    "we may obtain the simple analytic expressions of the @xmath2-bed and @xmath2-fdd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the exact integral representation is derived with the olm - mem after ref .",
    "we have discussed the @xmath0 expansion of physical quantities , using the ea and aa .",
    "numerical calculations are performed for electron and phonon models , for which we present the @xmath2-bed and @xmath2-fdd with the temperature - dependent energy . in sec . 3",
    ", we propose the ia , by which analytical expressions for @xmath2-bed and @xmath2-fdd are obtained . in sec . 4 , a comparison is made between the generalized distributions calculated by the four methods of the ea , ia , fa @xcite and the superstatistical approximation ( sa ) . a controversy on the validity of the fa @xcite is discussed . with the use of the four methods , the generalized sommerfeld expansion , and low - temperature electronic and phonon specific heats are calculated .",
