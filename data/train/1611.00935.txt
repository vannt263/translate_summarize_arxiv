    "[ intro ] the chemical structure of the carbon nanomaterials is based on the hexagonal atomic carbon lattice .",
    "the basic structure of this kind is graphene , a plain carbon monolayer .",
    "the molecules of other forms of this kind have this structure disrupted mostly by the pentagonal or the heptagonal defects . they can be created from the graphene monolayer by cutting or adding @xmath0 sectors ( fig .  [ defects ] ) .",
    "the name of the derived forms is mostly given by the shape  we have ( see fig .  [ nano ] ) nanotubes , nanocones , nanowires , nanoribbons , nanotoroids , etc .",
    "the well - known form is the fullerene which can be considered as a nanosphere .",
    "the electronic properties of all these materials make them interesting for physicists  they are good candidates for the construction of the molecular electronic devices to computers .",
    "the electronic structure is characterized by the local density of states ( ldos )  the number of electronic states per the unit surface area and the unit interval of energies . for the purpose of its calculation one of these two methods",
    "is mostly used  the direct calculation from the electronic spectrum @xcite ( the case of the periodical structures like graphene , fullerene , etc . ) , or , using the continuum gauge field - theory approach , a dirac - like equation is solved @xcite ( the aperiodical structures like wormhole , nanocone , etc . ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the second method .",
    "the corresponding dirac  like equation for the massless fermion @xcite has the form @xmath1\\psi^t = e\\psi^t,\\hspace{5 mm }   \\psi^t=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}f_1 \\\\",
    "f_2\\end{array}\\right).\\ ] ] here , the particular terms have this meaning : @xmath2 are the pauli matrices and @xmath3 is the zweibein @xcite which can be defined with the help of the metric tensor @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the metric of the uncurved space .",
    "next , @xmath6 is the spin connection ( a kind of a connection 1-form , @xcite ) and for the case of the rotational symmetry we have @xmath7 then , @xmath8 $ ] is the spin connection in the spinor representation .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath9 ensure the circular periodicity : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of the defects and @xmath12 is the chiral vector .",
    "the last term @xmath13 represents the electromagnetic potential coming from a possible presence of the magnetic field .",
    "then , for the given energy , the ldos is got as the sum of the squares of the radial components of the wave function , @xmath14",
    "in the case of the graphitic nanocone , which is the aperiodical structure , we use the formalism of the last section for calculation of its electronic structure . for the description of the geometry , we use the coordinates @xmath15 ( radial ) and @xmath16 ( angular ) and denote @xmath17 . then the radius - vector is @xmath18 from here , we calculate the components of the metric tensor and zweibein .",
    "then , the hamiltonian on the left side of ( [ direq ] ) will be @xcite @xmath19\\right\\},\\hspace{1cm}s=\\pm 1,\\ ] ] the solution is given by the bessel functions . here",
    ", @xmath20 represents the fermi velocity which gives the velocity of the electrons corresponding to the fermi energy @xcite . +      in contrast to the case of the plain graphene , negligible influence of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction ( soi ) can be considered in the graphitic nanocone . to investigate this influence",
    ", we perform the following substitutions in the hamiltonian : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the parameter which characterizes the strength of soi , @xmath23 are the nearest - neighbor and the next - nearest - neighbor hopping integrals , respectively , @xmath24 is the intrinsic term of the soi .",
    "the other parameters are described in @xcite .",
    "we are looking for the solution in the factorized form which is common for all the structures with the radial symmetry : @xmath25 here , the radial part must satisfy @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the spin  orbital coefficients .",
    "for finding the solution , we use the numerical methods . as the result of our calculations , the @xmath30",
    "is outlined in fig .",
    "[ ldosspin ] for @xmath31 . +     and different distance from the tip in the 2d and 3d graphs : 1 defect in the tip ( left ) , 2 defects ( middle ) , 3 defects ( right ) .",
    "`` turned off '' denotes the case when the influence of the soi is excluded.,width=415 ]      the numerical solution of the ldos found in the last section is distorted by the uncertainties coming from the systematical errors of the used method of performing the solution . to get more precise results",
    ", we can try to find the solution using the green function approach : in this approach , the ldos can be evaluated as @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the case with soi , @xmath34 stands for the interaction potential of soi , and @xmath35 representing the case without soi has the form @xmath36 @xmath37 are computed in @xcite .",
    "then , the first order approximation of the green function has the form @xmath38 @xmath39 the trace of this matrix is zero for arbitrary @xmath40 and , consequently , from ( [ trgr ] ) follows the zero value of the corresponding contribution to the ldos .",
    "that is why we need to calculate at least the second order approximation . for this purpose",
    ", we derive a recursion equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the elements of the matrix @xmath43 as an example , we introduce the corresponding expression for @xmath44 : @xmath45\\,{\\rm d}r\\,{\\rm d}\\varphi+\\ ] ] @xmath46\\,{\\rm d}r\\,{\\rm d}\\varphi.\\ ] ] then , using the usual procedure we get for the trace of the matrix @xmath47 @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56    now we can use ( [ trgr ] ) to calculate the ldos with the precision up to the second order of the green function approach : @xmath57,\\ ] ] where the lower index @xmath58 in ldos@xmath59 means the mentioned precision . for the purpose of comparison with our results from @xcite",

    "[ ldosspin ] for the mentioned values and the corresponding 0-th order and the second order approximation calculated using the green function .",
    "if the second order approximation of the green function is sufficient , the sum of the middle part and of the right part of fig .  [ ldos_green ] should give the left part of this figure .",
    "but as we can see , the scale of the zeroth order approximation is comparable with the scale of the supposed result , while the scale of the second order approximation differs significantly .",
    "this is caused at least by one of these 2 factors : either the second order approximation is not sufficient to get the correct result , or the results for the second order are not normalized sufficiently . from a simple comparison of the graphs",
    "one could expect the first possibility , but only the calculation of the next orders and the performance of the corresponding normalization can confirm this estimation .",
