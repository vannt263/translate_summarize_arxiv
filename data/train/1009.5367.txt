    "dwarf novae constitute a subclass of the cataclysmic variables ( warner 1995b ) , semi - detached interacting binaries in which a roche - lobe filling secondary transfers matter to a more massive white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the transferred material possesses angular momentum , and therefore can only `` fall '' toward the primary down to a radius determined by its specific angular momentum ( lubow & shu 1975 ) .",
    "this angular momentum barrier is overcome by angular momentum transport within the accretion disk which carries angular momentum outward and mass inward .",
    "current thinking about the physical mechanism responsible for accretion centers on the magneto - rotational instability ( @xmath3mri ; balbus & hawley 1998 ) in which the shearing amplification of a weak seed magnetic field leads to turbulent transport .",
    "v344 lyr is a short period dwarf nova , of subtype su uma ( @xmath4 h ; still et al .",
    "2010 ) exhibiting a supercycle pattern ( 109.6 d ; kato et al . 2002 ) consisting of superoutbursts separated by normal outbursts .",
    "superoutbursts are long outbursts with slow , exponential decays exhibiting superhumps @xmath5 modulations in the light curve at a period greater than the orbital period by a few percent . the data presented in kato et al .",
    "reveal only the brightest portions of the superoutbursts ; the fainter portions and all of the normal outbursts lie below the lower limit of detection .",
    "the _ kepler _ data set for v344 lyrae ( _ kepler _ i d 7659570 ) @xmath5 270 d at 1 min cadence @xmath5 provides an extraordinary resource for accretion disk modelers .",
    "the accretion disk limit cycle mechanism , which is currently employed to account for dwarf nova outbursts , is based on the storage of material during quiescence in a non - steady - state configuration , followed by a dumping of matter onto the accreting wd when a critical surface density is attained in the disk , producing an outburst . during outburst",
    "the disk is roughly in steady state , except for the action of a cooling front that begins at the outer disk and moves inward .",
    "the thermal - viscous limit cycle model is not a complete model for the accretion disk , but rather primarily a model for the outbursts ; for instance it fails to account for the high x - ray luminosities seen in dwarf novae in quiescence ( wheatley , mauche , & mattei 2003 , mukai , zietsman , & still 2009 ) .",
    "previous attempts at constraining physical parameters of the model have relied on aavso ( american association of variable star observers ) and rasnz ( royal astronomical society of new zealand ) data for the long term light curves .",
    "these data are typically given as 1d means , with large attendant error bars ( @xmath00.3@xmath50.5 mag ) .",
    "the _ kepler _ data provide an entirely new level of precision , and allow detailed model constraints .",
    "the viscosity parameter @xmath6 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) sets the disk time scales .",
    "to first order , @xmath7 controls the recurrence time for outbursts , and @xmath8 sets the duration of the outbursts .",
    "previous efforts , for instance by smak ( 1984@xmath3s84 ) , utilized the `` bailey relation '' relating the rate of the fast decay in dne with orbital period to infer that @xmath9 .",
    "this remains the only firm constraint we have in astronomy for @xmath6 in ionized gas , and has served as a benchmark value for modelers calculating the efficiency of the mri in accretion disks ( e.g. , hirose et al .",
    "2009 ) . by comparing theoretical modeling of",
    "the mri with the observational constraints , king , pringle , & livio ( 2007 ) showed that theoretical values tend to be at least an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "most of the simulations have studied the growth and subsequent nonlinear saturation of the mri using idealized `` shearing boxes '' without realistic vertical structure , and for such calculations the asymptotic strength of the magnetic field decreases with increasing resolution ( fromang & papaloizou 2007 ) .",
    "vishniac ( 2009 ) argues that current models are not sophisticated enough in terms of their dynamic range and treatment of the vertical disk structure to allow a realistic treatment of such important effects as magnetic buoyancy and vertical transport of magnetic helicity by turbulent eddies , and therefore comparisons of theoretical @xmath6 values with those inferred from observations are specious at the present time .",
    "our goal in this work is to find model parameters that can account for the gross properties of the long term v344 lyr light curve",
    ". there will be additional features in the light curve that can be compared to the detailed model light curves in order to gain insight into shortcomings of the model .",
    "we also investigate systematic effects such as the number of grid points and time step size .    in  2 we present an overview of the physics of accretion disks . in ",
    "3 we discuss the v344 lyr light curve , in  4 we present a review of viscous decays in several well - studied dwarf novae , in  5 we detail the numerical model , in  6 we present the results , in  7 we discuss the results in a larger context , and in  8 we sum up .",
    "in the accretion disk limit cycle model , gas accumulates in quiescence and accretes onto the central object in outburst ( e.g. , cannizzo 1993a , lasota 2001 for reviews ) .",
    "the phases of quiescence and outburst are mediated by the action of heating and cooling fronts that traverse the disk and bring about phase transitions between low and high states , consisting of neutral and ionized gas , respectively . during quiescence ,",
    "when the surface density @xmath10 at some radius within the disk exceeds a critical value @xmath11 , a transition to the high state is initiated ; during outburst , when @xmath10 drops below a different critical value @xmath12 , a transition to the low state is initiated .",
    "low - to - high transitions can begin at any radius , whereas high - to - low transitions begin at the outer disk edge .",
    "this situation comes about because in the outburst disk @xmath13 ( roughly ) , and the critical surface densities both increase with radius .",
    "since the disk mass accumulated in quiescence is bounded by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one can define a maximum disk mass @xmath14 and a minimum disk mass @xmath15 which will bound the general , time dependent disk mass .    for normal , `` short '' outbursts",
    ", only a few percent of the stored gas accretes onto the central object : the thermal time scale of a thin disk is short compared to the viscous time scale , and the cooling front that is launched from the outer edge of the disk almost as soon as the disk enters into outburst traverses the disk and reverts it back to quiescence . for disks that have been `` filled '' to a higher level with respect to @xmath16 , the surface density in the outer disk can significantly exceed the critical surface density @xmath17 . in order for the cooling front to begin , however",
    ", the outer surface density @xmath18 must drop below @xmath19 .",
    "disks in this state generate much longer outbursts , with slower `` viscous '' plateaus , because the entire disk must remain in its high , completely ionized state until enough mass has been lost onto the wd for the condition @xmath20 to be satisfied .",
    "the slow decay associated with a superoutburst is a direct reflection of the viscous time scale in the outer disk , whereas the subsequent faster decay reveals the thermal time scale . although the decays of dwarf novae at a given orbital period are fairly uniform , and form the basis for the bailey relation , the rise times show a greater variety , reflecting the fact that the outburst can be triggered anywhere in the disk ( cannizzo 1998b ) .",
    "inside - out bursts tend to produce slow - rise times , whereas outside - in bursts produce fast rises ( cannizzo , wheeler , & polidan 1986 ) .",
    "van paradijs ( 1983 ) undertook a statistical study of outburst properties of dwarf novae spanning a range in orbital period , from @xmath21 hr to @xmath010 hr . by studying separately the behavior of long and short outbursts versus orbital period , he found that the apparent strong contrast between superoutbursts and normal outbursts in the su uma systems is due to the fact that the widths of the short ( narrow ) outbursts scales with orbital period , whereas the widths of the long ( wide ) outbursts is relatively constant .",
    "van paradijs argument is strengthened by the more extensive data set examined by ak , ozkan , & mattei ( 2002 ) in which the linear trend in the narrow width-@xmath22 relation is more obvious ( compare fig . 4 from ak et al .",
    "3b from van paradijs ) . in these studies",
    "the widths of the outbursts were `` corrected '' by subtracting the rise and decay times .    for any dynamical system in which a variety of timescales contribute to a physical observable , in this case the flux from the accretion disk ,",
    "the controlling time scale will be the slowest one .",
    "since all the disk timescales @xmath5 dynamical , thermal , and viscous @xmath5 increase with radius , the time scale associated with the viscous plateau provides direct information about the viscous time scale @xmath23 at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "warner ( 1995ab ) presents a simple physical model for the state of the disk during superoutburst . during the superoutburst",
    "the disk is roughly in steady state with @xmath24 out to some @xmath25 which represents the radius at which the outward moving heating front stalls .",
    "the rate of accretion within the disk is much greater than the mass transfer rate from the secondary star , which can be neglected during this time .",
    "therefore the mass of the hot , accreting disk is @xmath26 from the standard accretion disk theory relating effective temperature with accretion rate in a steady - state disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , one has @xmath27 where @xmath28)$ ] is the effective temperature associated with @xmath29 . combining eqns .",
    "[ [ brian1 ] ] and [ [ brian2 ] ] ( same as eqns .",
    "[ 15 ] and [ 16 ] from warner 1995a , and [ 3.46 ] and [ 3.47 ] from warner 1995b ) yields @xmath30 since the right hand side ( excluding @xmath31 ) is constant , the solution for the mass of the hot disk , and also its derivative , is a decreasing exponential function .",
    "using power law scalings for @xmath32 and @xmath29 , setting @xmath25 equal to the 3:1 resonance radius with the binary orbital period , and noting that luminosity varies as @xmath33 , one can show ( cf .",
    "[ 20 ] of warner 1995a ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the orbital period in hr , and @xmath37 .",
    "( the @xmath6 in this context is the hot state value . ) within the viscous plateau portion of a superoutburst , the instigation and propagation of a cooling front at the outer edge is thwarted by virtue of excessive mass in the disk .",
    "this phenomenon is not new and has been seen in numerous previous studies ( e.g. , cannizzo 1993b@xmath3c93b , hameury et al .",
    "1998@xmath3h98 , ludwig & meyer 1998 , buat - mnard , hameury , & lasota 2001 , schreiber , hameury , & lasota 2003 ) .",
    "the viscous time does not represent the duration of the outburst itself , but rather the time scale ( approximately in d mag@xmath1 ) associated with the viscous plateau ; it represents an @xmath38folding time for the decrease of disk mass .",
    "whitehurst ( 1988 ) discovered a hydrodynamical instability that can occur in the outer parts of accretion disks when the mass ratio @xmath39 is less than 1/4 .",
    "for these extreme mass ratio systems , expected in cvs below the period gap if the secondary fills its roche lobe , the outer part of the disk can lie beyond the point of 3:1 resonance with the binary period .",
    "the outer disk can then be excited by the inner lindblad resonance ( lubow 1991ab ) , causing the global disk oscillation mode that is observed as common superhumps . before the onset of the superhump oscillation , there are well - known spiral dissipation waves in the disk that are fixed in the co - rotating frame .",
    "once the superhump oscillation begins , these spiral arms advance @xmath40 every superhump cycle . as a given arm passes between the two stars , it expands outward in the shallower potential , but as fluid in that arm compresses back into the disk as the disk is maximally distorted , viscous dissipation causes a peak in the photometric light curve ( simpson & wood 1998 ) .",
    "a secondary source of the superhump signal is caused by the variable distance the mass stream must fall from the l1 point to the edge of the non - axisymmetric , flexing disk . because the outer disk is thought to expand during superoutburst , potentially beyond the 3:1 radius , the `` tidal instability '' model provides a natural explanation for superhumps . if the mass ratio is extreme enough , superhumps can also occur outside of superoutbursts because the disk can remain extended beyond the 3:1 radius , and therefore continue oscillating even into quiescence .",
    "osaki ( 1989ab ) combined the accretion disk limit cycle model with whitehurst s tidal instability model and proposed the `` thermal - tidal '' instability model ( ttim ) for superoutbursts .",
    "this model posits that the presence of an oscillating precessing disk , triggered by the migration of gas beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , also leads to a greatly enhanced tidal torque acting on the disk .",
    "this ultimately contracts the outer disk and leads to a superoutburst .",
    "thus in the ttim one has the usual hysteresis relation between surface density and temperature in the disk , and also a hysteresis relation between the total angular momentum of the disk and the tidal torque acting on the outer disk .",
    "( the latter hysteresis is somewhat speculative . )",
    "this model was examined in detail and compared to the enhanced mass transfer model ( emtm ) for superoutbursts by ichikawa , hirose , & osaki ( 1993 ) and later workers , most recently schreiber et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    for completeness",
    ", we note that smak has recently challenged the conventional wisdom that superhumps are due to a precessing , eccentric disk ( smak 2009abcd ) .",
    "smak ( 2009a ) presents a re - analysis of data taken by earlier workers on z cha , wz sge , oy car , and iy uma and claims that a variety of errors , including miscalculated beat phases and an assumption that observed eclipses are pure disk eclipses , led to erroneously large values of the eccentricity @xmath41 .",
    "smak s re - analysis of the disk eccentricity in z cha leads to @xmath42 .",
    "smak ( 2009b ) compares in detail observed values for the amplitudes of superhumps with theoretical values determined from bolometric light curves produced by smooth - particle hydrodynamics calculations .",
    "he finds the observed values to be @xmath010 times larger than the theoretical values .",
    "smak ( 2009c ) presents a re - analysis of five eclipses of z cha observed by warner & odonoghue ( 1988 ) .",
    "smak examines two local minima at orbital phases @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "he argues that the first minimum is not due to an occultation but rather absorption in the mass overflow stream , and the second minimum coincides with the trajectory of the mass overflow stream .",
    "the upshot of his analysis is that superhumps are due to modulated mass transfer which leads to periodically enhanced dissipation of the stream kinetic energy .",
    "smak ( 2009d ) presents evidence for periodically variable irradiation of secondary components and proposes that superhumps are due to enhanced dissipation of the stream kinetic energy .",
    "he outlines specific future modeling efforts that might clarify the overall picture .",
    "the bandpass utilized by _ kepler _ is considerably broader than the standard johnson @xmath45 band .",
    "figure 1 gives a comparison of the two filters . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to johnson @xmath45 apparent and absolute magnitudes using @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and _ kepler _ apparent and absolute magnitudes using @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "figure 2 shows the _ kepler _ light curve of v344 lyr .",
    "the observation window contains 19 outbursts showing the sequencing ssslssssssslsssssss , where s@xmath3short outburst and l@xmath3long outburst , i.e. , a superoutburst .",
    "based on photographic observations made by hoffmeister ( 1966 ) , kato ( 1993 ) estimated that the cycle length for normal outbursts was 16@xmath493 d. an estimate of this cycle length prior to _ kepler _ was difficult because the normal outbursts of v344 lyr are short - lived and reach only to near @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) . in table 1",
    "we list the durations ( using @xmath52 as the cut line ) and amplitudes ( measured from the local mean quiescence level ) of the 19 observed outbursts ( 17 normal and two superoutbursts ) .",
    "both the recurrence times and amplitudes of the normal outbursts appear to reach a maximum roughly midway between superoutbursts , rather than increasing monotonically between consecutive superoutbursts as in the ttim .",
    "we also note that the level of quiescence is @xmath01 mag higher after the superoutburst , and declines with an @xmath38folding time of @xmath53 d. this trend may be associated with the cooling of the wd after being heated by the mass accreted during superoutburst ( e.g. , sion 1995 ) .",
    "the superoutbursts last @xmath54 d and reach a maximum amplitude @xmath55 mag .",
    "the decline of the superoutbursts are close to linear ( plotted as mag versus time , or exponential as flux versus time ) for @xmath56 d , after which they fall rapidly ( @xmath02 d ) back to quiescence . during this part",
    "the decline rate is 0.083 mag d@xmath1 , in good agreement with the value of 0.094 mag d@xmath1 found by kato ( 1993 ) .",
    "the amount of time spent at @xmath57 is @xmath014 d , and the duration of the entire plateau is @xmath012 d. the decay rate is @xmath012 d mag@xmath1 , therefore the plateau portion of the decay encompasses @xmath01 mag @xmath5 a dynamic range of @xmath02.5 , or slightly less than one @xmath38folding ( @xmath02.7@xmath58 ) .",
    "there are also @xmath00.5 mag shoulders on the superoutburst rises lasting @xmath01 d , which appear to be normal outbursts embedded at the beginning of the superoutbursts .",
    "it is noteworthy that the fast decays of the normal outbursts and superoutburst have a faster - than - exponential shape ( i.e. , concave downward when plotted as magnitude versus time ) .",
    "s84 utilized the bailey relation between the fast rate of decay in dwarf novae and their orbital period to constrain @xmath59 .",
    "the large errors associated with the aavso data were consistent with exponential decay .",
    "cannizzo ( 1994 ) found that to account for the supposedly exponential decays , which correspond to the time during which a cooling front traverses the disk , @xmath6 must vary weakly with radius ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the faster - than - exponential decays captured by _ kepler _ in v344 lyr negate this result and indicate that a constant @xmath6 scaling with radius is consistent with the data .",
    "the bailey relation between the fast rate of decay of dwarf nova outbursts and orbital period corresponds to the time interval during which the cooling front traverses the disk .",
    "some long dwarf nova outbursts have enough dynamic range in @xmath45 that one can also use the slow decay portion , the viscous plateau , to infer an @xmath6 value .",
    "these inferred values agree with those determined from the bailey relation ( warner 1995ab ; cannizzo 2001b , cannizzo et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the decay rates associated with several dwarf novae exhibiting viscous plateaus have been fairly well established , and enable one to make a reasonable estimate of the decay rate expected in a system with the orbital period of v344 lyr .",
    "the _ kepler _ observation gives a decay rate within the superoutburst @xmath012 d mag@xmath1 . we associate this with the viscous time , which is basically an @xmath38folding time for a perturbation to the @xmath10 profile to be damped out . for a disk with a @xmath10 profile approximating steady state ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath24 , and for which the mass flow within the disk and onto the wd greatly exceeds the rate of mass addition feeding into the outer disk from the secondary star , the viscous time represents roughly a time for the mass of the disk to decrease by a factor @xmath41 .",
    "thus for a given viscous plateau - type outburst , the ratio @xmath61 represents the number of @xmath38foldings by which the mass of the disk decreases due to accretion onto the central object .",
    "it is instructive to look at examples of viscous decays in several well - studied dwarf novae :    * ss cyg mas ( harrison et al . 1999 ) which implies @xmath62 pc , the accretion disk limit cycle model is not able to reproduce dwarf nova outbursts for ss cyg ( schreiber & lasota 2007 , smak 2010 ) .",

    "* u gem : * in the 1985 long outburst of u gem ( @xmath67 hr ) , the decay rate during the viscous plateau was @xmath026 d mag@xmath1 over the @xmath035 d of the burst ( cannizzo et al .",

    "2 the locally defined decay rate during the plateau remains constant at @xmath012 d mag@xmath1 over most of the @xmath014 d of the burst , thus as with u gem @xmath070% of the disk mass accreted onto the wd .",
    "* wz sge : * in the 2001 superoutburst of wz sge ( @xmath69 min ) , the locally defined decay rate during the plateau increased from @xmath04 to @xmath012 d mag@xmath1 over the @xmath020 d of the burst ( cannizzo 2001b ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath70 means that only a few percent of the initial disk mass remained at the end of the superoutburst .",
    "( an alternative considered in the discussion is that irradiation - induced enhanced mass overflow from the secondary star prolonged the superoutburst . ) without a very low @xmath71 there is not enough accumulated mass in the disk to account for the outburst s fluence ( smak 1993 ) and the long recurrence time .    in summary",
    ", one can readily find examples of known systems with viscous type outbursts in which the duration of the outburst itself is either greater than , less than , or about the same as the viscous time scale evaluated at the outer edge of the accretion disk .",

    "figure 8 shows the effect of varying the inner disk radius . for smaller",
    "inner disk radii , one has a larger dynamic range in @xmath184 and as a result there tends to be a more complete emptying of the disk during outbursts , and therefore less of a tendency to have a series of short outbursts leading up to a superoutburst .",

    "figure 9 shows the effect of varying the outer disk radius . for larger @xmath186 values not only",

    "no one light curve we have shown reproduces all features of the observed light curve shown in fig .",

    ", there is an atypically long quiescent period at the beginning of the observed light curve .",
    "the recurrence time for outbursts varies inversely to varying degrees with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath149 ( csw ) .",
    "therefore if any one of these parameters were anomalously small , that could delay an outburst . also , the pre - superoutburst normal outbursts are brighter than the post - superoutburst normal outbursts , and the pre - superoutburst quiescent level is fainter than the post - superoutburst quiescent level . as noted earlier",
    ", the disk instability model is ill - equipped to make any statement about the quiescent state .",
    "however , one possibility might be that @xmath149 were elevated for a while after the superoutburst ; that could lead to crowding of the short outbursts , and an increase in the quiescent level",
    ". there may be other causal relations among @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath149 , which are important .",
    "an analysis of the phase variations in the quiescent - state oscillations in the light curve at the beginning of fig .",
    "2 light curve show these are likely to be negative superhumps .  as such they indicate accretion onto an accretion disk that is tilted a few degrees out of the orbital plane and precessing slowly in the retrograde direction ( barrett et al .",

    "2006 ; wood & burke 2007 , wood et al . 2000 , 2009 ) .",
    "instead of impacting the rim of the disk , the accretion spot sweeps across first one face of the tilted disk and then the other during one orbit , impacting the rim only twice during one cycle , along the line of nodes .",
    "thus , the accretion mass and energy is deposited throughout a range of radii in the disk , and this may act to stabilize the disk against dn outbursts .   the slow rise of the first dwarf nova oscillations after the long quiescent state indicates that this is an inside - out outburst , consistent with the deposition of mass primarily in the inner disk .",
    "clearly these data motivate further study of the thermal - viscous limit cycle instability in tilted disks .",
    "the primary interpolation scheme we considered , given in eqn .",
    "( [ log ] ) , has clear problems in making good superoutbursts .",
    "the model superoutbursts have shoulders which comprise about a third to half of the total viscous plateau , rather than the @xmath010% observed .",
    "however , for the h98 scaling with @xmath164 k , the shoulders are appropriately short , @xmath02 d , and the viscous plateaus much longer .",
    "the rate of decay of the viscous plateau is too fast , but that is because the input parameters have been optimized for the scaling given in eqn .",
    "( [ log ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the thermal - tidal instability of osaki ( ichikawa & osaki 1992 , 1994 ; ichikawa , hirose , & osaki 1993 ) in which the tidal torque is artificially enhanced by a factor of 20 when the outer disk expands beyond the point of 3:1 commensurability with the orbital period , our detailed modeling shows that the regular and superoutbursts can produced with a constant set of parameters .",
    "in retrospect , one may legitimately question the motivation for the increased tidal torque accompanying the expansion of the disk , considering that the ultimate driving force behind the tidal torque is the gravitational field of the secondary , which remains unchanged .",
    "we share a common viewpoint with van paradijs ( 1983 ) in that we regard the superoutbursts in the su uma systems as an extension of the long outbursts in dne above the period gap , such as u gem and ss cyg ( cannizzo & mattei 1992 , 1998 ; c93b ) .",
    "continued monitoring of v344 lyr should reveal the stability of the long term sequencing , i.e. , variations in the number of shorts sandwiched between two longs .",
    "the shoulders on the rise to superoutburst in the models have more structure than the shoulder in the observed superoutburst .",
    "the shoulders arise because the initial tendency of the triggering of thermal instability is to produce a short outburst .",
    "however , due to the long - term net build - up of mass in the disk at large radii between successive short outbursts , there is actually enough material accumulated to support a superoutburst .",
    "it takes a little longer however for the outward moving heating front to progress to larger radii and to fully access this additional store of matter , which manifests itself as a ring of enhanced surface density in the outer disk .",
    "this explains the fact that many observed superoutbursts appear to start as normal ( short ) outbursts .",
    "the subsequent rise after the shoulder is due to the full radial extent of the disk out to the outer edge making a transition to the hot state .",
    "in contrast , for the short ( normal ) outbursts , not enough disk mass has accumulated at larger radii by the time of the outburst to support the heating transition front propagating to large radii , therefore the heating front stalls at some @xmath187 and is reflected as a cooling front , leading to pointy maxima rather than viscous plateaus .",
    "our testing has delineated a range of allowable parameters :    \\(1 ) the logarithmic interpolation for @xmath6 produces well - separated outbursts , with concave downward decays , as observed .",
    "the linear interpolation produces outbursts with minimal quiescence and concave upward decays .",
    "given the physical underpinnings of the mri , the logarithmic interpolation is better motivated since the mri strength should depend on the partial ionization fraction , which is a strongly increasing function of temperature .    in terms of the superoutburst , the h98 scaling with @xmath164 k produces the best overall results .",
    "the shoulder feature only persists @xmath188 d , as observed , and the viscous plateau is longer .",
    "about 70% of the stored mass is accreted .",
    "the main deficiencies are that the fast decay ( i.e. , that following the viscous plateau ) is slower - than - exponential , and the rise times are too fast ( as with the other calculations ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the minimum number of grid points necessary is @xmath189 ( in accord with c93b and h98 ) . even for high @xmath170 ,",
    "the sequencing is not perfectly stable .",
    "\\(3 ) of the terms entering into the thermal energy equation , the radial viscous transport term @xmath86 and the second advective term , @xmath190 appear to be the most important .",

    "the inferred values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are to be viewed merely as best - fit parameters for v344 lyr ; they do not allow us to draw any deep conclusions as regards other systems .",
    "( 5 ) the values @xmath153 and @xmath186 strongly mediate the number of short outbursts between two superoutbursts . for @xmath182 and @xmath193",
    "we have @xmath05 shorts between two longs for @xmath194 cm , or @xmath03@xmath195 for @xmath196 .",
    "observations by howell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) seem to favor an evacuated inner disk .",
    "several possibilities are discussed by these workers , including the possibility of weak intermediate polars in the su uma systems .",
    "the outbursts in our models are triggered at intermediate disk radii , therefore the outer disk radius has minimal effect on the outburst recurrence times and durations .",
    "increasing @xmath186 from @xmath197 cm to @xmath198 cm increases the number of shorts between to successive longs , and also distorts the profile of the superoutburst .    with @xmath148",
    ", we match the rate of decay of the viscous portion of the superoutburst , and also find a @xmath00.5 mag shoulder on the rise to superoutburst .",
    "it is not clear why previous detailed time dependent modelers did not find this shoulder ( e.g. , s04 ) .",
    "the main deficiency in the models with the standard logarithmic @xmath2 interpolation is their failure to produce a sufficiently long viscous plateau on the superoutburst .",
    "the observed plateau has a decay rate of @xmath012 d mag@xmath1 and lasts for @xmath012 d , which corresponds to @xmath01 @xmath38folding in the decay of the disk mass , meaning about 60% of the disk mass should be accreted .",
    "our viscous plateau lasts @xmath06@xmath58 d , with proportionally less mass accreted .",
    "however , the light curve using the h98 scaling with @xmath164 k ( which appears to be physically motivated insofar as it tracks @xmath167 ) has substantially longer superoutbursts , @xmath199 d , with appropriately short shoulders as observed .",
    "the reason for the shorter shoulders is that the temperature within the outward moving heating front accompanying superoutburst onset is between about @xmath200 and @xmath201 k. as can be seen in figure 5 by comparing the left - most green curve ( i.e. , the h98_12500 scaling ) with the `` log '' curve , for the temperature range @xmath200 k @xmath202 k , @xmath6 is larger in the h98_12500 scaling and therefore the heating front travels faster since its speed varies with @xmath6 ( menou , hameury , & stehle 1999 ) .",
    "the duration of the shoulder feature corresponds to the interval during which the heating front is moving outward and finding that enough mass is present at large radii to support a superoutburst .",
    "this causes the dip and subsequent rise to the plateau of the superoutburst .",
    "the values for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath149 have already been optimized to get the supercycle and normal cycle periods of @xmath0100 d and @xmath010 d , respectively .",
    "one suspects that the scalings for @xmath203 and @xmath204 are too simplistic and fail to take into account the actual disk physics , particularly that of the quiescent state , which is presently unknown .",
    "one could envision introducing an ad hoc multiplicative parameter for @xmath205 , for instance to artificially enhance it , but then one would have to re - adjust all the other parameters , in particular increasing @xmath149 which is already uncomfortably large . in view of these considerations",
    "we consider our experiment moderately successful in that we are able to reproduce the duration of the viscous plateau within a factor of two in an over - constrained system for which @xmath7 and @xmath8 have already been determined by the outburst properties .",
    "what about having enhanced mass transfer from the secondary prolong the duration of the superoutburst ?",
    "smak ( 2004 ) presented observational evidence for enhanced hot spot brightness near superoutburst maxima which he interpreted as being due to enhanced mass transfer brought about by the strong irradiation of the secondary .",
    "osaki & meyer ( 2003 ) presented a theoretical study of the effects of irradiation on the photosphere of the secondary star in su uma systems and concluded that mass transfer could not be enhanced by a significant amount because the coriolis force prevents the formation of a circulation flow transporting heat toward l1 .",
    "viallet & hameury ( 2007@xmath3v07 , 2008@xmath3v08 ) present two - dimensional , time dependent calculations of the surface flow of material of irradiated secondaries and find the physical situation to be significantly different from that envisioned by either osaki & meyer or smak .",
    "the coriolis force leads to the formation of a circulation flow from the high latitude regions to the vicinity of the l1 point , but rapid cooling of the gas as it enters the shielded equatorial region prevents significant heat transport ( v07 ) .",
    "v07 conclude that any resulting mass transfer rate enhancement is likely to be moderate and unable to account for the duration of long outbursts in dwarf novae .",
    "v08 look at two effects that could potentially induce secondary mass transfer rate variations in dwarf novae and soft x - ray transients : irradiation of the secondary by the hot outer disk rim during outburst , and scattered radiation by optically thin outflowing material .",
    "they conclude that for dwarf nova parameters the effects on enhanced mass transfer are negligible . for completeness we note that some of the assumptions of v07 and v08 may not apply if the disk is warped or tilted , in which case the l1 point could in principle be directly irradiated .",
    "s04 presented detailed time dependent calculations of the accretion disk evolution in both the ttim and the emtm , and in the end concluded that the emtm was favored .",
    "their arguments are rather general , however , and they state `` ... we have not proven the emtm to be correct nor the ttim not to work . ''",
    "both models have a number of free parameters in addition to those already present in the standard limit cycle model . for the ttim one has the time delay between the attainment of the 3:1 radius by the outer disk edge and the onset of enhanced tidal torque , in addition to the functional form and amplitude associated with the increase .",
    "similarly the emtm has as free parameters the degree of augmentation of @xmath149 during superoutburst , as well as its functional form with time .    in addition",
    ", there may be a problem with the viscous decay in the emtm : the v344 lyr superoutburst maintained a closely exponential decay over @xmath01 mag , whereas our models as well as others reveal a definite slower - than - exponential trend ( i.e. , concave upward when plotted as magnitude versus time ) in viscous plateaus covering that much dynamic range .",
    "although the viscous decays can be lengthened in the emtm , they tend to have noticeable deviations from exponentiality , in contrast to the v344 superoutburst .",
    "the fact that the short orbital period system wz sge did show a deviation from exponentiality in its 2001 outburst , which also spanned a greater dynamic range than in the v344 lyr superoutburst ( @xmath188 mag versus @xmath01 mag ) , may indicate that irradiation - induced enhanced mass transfer is a factor at much shorter orbital periods than for v344 lyr .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the @xmath00.5 mag shoulder on the rise to superoutburst is roughly matched in our calculations ; with enhanced mass transfer the shoulder amplitude is too great ( @xmath206 mag ) .",
    "we consider it fortunate that we have matched the decay as well as we have since the scalings for the extrema in the limit cycle model , in particular @xmath203 , are most probably gross simplifications to a more complicated situation that is currently beyond our understanding .",
    "we have presented detailed time dependent calculations of the accretion disk limit cycle mechanism with application to the _ kepler _ light curve of v344 lyr .",
    "we find that the basic disk instability model is able to account for the mixture of normal and superoutbursts with a minimal amount of fine - tuning .",
    "given the additional free parameters associated with both the thermal - tidal model and the enhanced mass transfer models , we do not attempt to examine their possible ramifications in this work",
    ". it may be that the plain vanilla disk instability acting alone is sufficient to explain most aspects of the long term v344 lyr light curve .",
    "we also note that the normal outbursts in v344 lyr do not show a monotonic increase in recurrence time and amplitude between successive superoutbursts as predicted by the ttim ( see ichikawa , hirose , & osaki 1993 , fig . 1 ; osaki 2005 , fig .",
    "3 ) , but rather a maximum in these quantities near the middle of a supercycle . the models we present also do not show the observed variations .",
    "one can in some sense view the alternation of many successive short outbursts with a superoutburst as an extensive of the pattern of short and long outbursts seen in the longer orbital period systems such as u gem and ss cyg ( van paradijs 1983 ) ; for su uma parameters one has many more short outbursts between two longs than in a system like ss cyg , which exhibits lslsls ... most of the time ( cannizzo & mattei 1992 ) . for our best - fit model parameters , we find that @xmath207 grid points are required for numerical stability , with a resulting pattern in which 5@xmath57 short outbursts occur between two successive superoutbursts ( for @xmath208 ) .",
    "overall , our outbursts are at about the same brightness as those observed in v344 lyr for an intermediately inclined disk . having constrained @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "so as to produce the overall recurrence time scales of short outbursts and superoutbursts , there are several obvious deficiencies : the rise times of all outbursts are too fast , the superoutburst duration is too short , and the duration of the shoulder is too long and has an extra scalloped - out feature prior to the observed shoulder .",
    "however , the more physically motivated h98 scaling with @xmath164 k does a better job on making superoutbursts with minimal shoulders as observed , lasting @xmath02 d , and also longer viscous plateaus , @xmath199 d vs. the observed @xmath209 d. the normal outburst embedded at the start of a superoutburst is due to the initial triggering of the thermal instability and outward movement of the heating front ; the subsequent dip and rise to superoutburst maximum comes about because the heating front continues to move outward , and subsequently to access the stored material at large radii in the disk which accumulates where the heating front spike stalls at the end of a normal outburst .    even as we struggle to account for the finer points of the light curve , such as the shoulder on the superoutburst , we feel compelled to step back briefly from our myopic scrutiny of the details and give some modicum of thanks and appreciation for the fact that the _ kepler _ data represent such a huge advance over what was available even as recently as one year ago . for long term dwarf nova light curves ,",
    "the only data sets that had been available were those amassed by the aavso and similar organizations .",
    "while these data have certainly been useful and yielded many interesting results , one could only study in detail the brightest systems , like ss cyg and u gem .",
    "in addition , the data quality was uneven and the time sampling coarse .",
    "when new data become available that are an order of magnitude better than the previous data , it becomes possible to make discoveries that are different in `` kind '' , not just in `` degree '' .",

    "<S> we present time dependent modeling based on the accretion disk limit cycle model for a 270 d light curve of the short period su uma - type dwarf nova v344 lyr taken by _ kepler_. the unprecedented precision and cadence ( 1 minute ) far surpass that generally available for long term light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the data encompass two superoutbursts and 17 normal ( i.e. , short ) outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the main decay of the superoutbursts is nearly perfectly exponential , decaying at a rate @xmath012 d mag@xmath1 , while the much more rapid decays of the normal outbursts exhibit a faster - than - exponential shape . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling using the basic accretion disk limit cycle can produce the main features of the v344 lyr light curve , including the peak outburst brightness . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless there are obvious deficiencies in our model light curves : ( 1 ) the rise times we calculate , both for the normal and superoutbursts , are too fast . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the superoutbursts are too short . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the shoulders on the rise to superoutburst have more structure than the shoulder in the observed superoutburst and are too slow , comprising about a third to half of the total viscous plateau , rather than the @xmath010% observed . </S>",
    "<S> however , one of the @xmath2 interpolation schemes we investigate ( one that is physically motivated ) does yield longer superoutbursts with suitably short , less structured shoulders . </S>"
