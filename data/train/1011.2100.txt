    "nonvanishing neutrino magnetic moment leads to the helicity - flip process in which the left - handed neutrinos produced in the stellar interior could convert into the right - handed ones , i.e. , sterile with respect to the weak interaction .",
    "this can be important , for example , when the stellar energy losses are taken into account .",
    "a considerable interest to the neutrino magnetic moment arised after the great event of the sn1987a in connection with the modelling of a supernova explosion , where a gigantic neutrino outflow determines in fact the process energetics .",
    "it means that such a microscopic neutrino characteristic as the neutrino magnetic moment would have a crucial influence on macroscopic properties of these astrophysical events .",
    "too huge outflow of right - handed neutrinos , produced due to the magnetic moment interaction , from the core would leave no enough energy to explain the observed neutrino luminosity of the supernova .",
    "hence an upper bound can be established on the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "the neutrino helicity flip @xmath0 under physical conditions corresponding to the central region of a supernova has been studied in a number of works ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ; a more extended reference list is given in ref .",
    "the process is possible due to the interaction of the dirac - neutrino magnetic moment with a virtual plasmon , which can be both generated and absorbed : @xmath1 a detailed analysis of the processes  ( [ eq : conversion ] ) , with neutrino - helicity conversion due to the interaction with both plasma electrons and protons via a virtual plasmon and with taking account of polarization effects of the plasma on the photon propagator was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular , according to the numerical analysis the plasma proton contribution turned out to be not only significant but even dominant .",
    "however , all of the previous studies  @xcite were based on a very simplified model of the supernova core as the uniform ball with some averaged values of physical parameters . moreover , according to modern views , the parameter values look rather too high than typical .    the aim of this paper is to make the estimation of the dirac neutrino magnetic moment from the limit on the supernova core luminosity for @xmath2 emission by a more consistent way , taking some radial distributions and time evolution of physical parameters from some realistic models of the supernova core .",
    "the upper bounds are obtained on the combination of the effective magnetic moments of the electron , muon and tau neutrinos from the condition of not - spoiling the subsequent kelvin ",
    "helmholtz stage of the supernova explosion by emission of right - handed neutrinos during a few seconds after the collapse .    for completeness",
    ", we consider here a general case of the magnetic moment matrix @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "for the processes with the initial electron neutrino one should replace @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the unitary leptonic mixing matrix by pontecorvo  maki  nakagawa  sakata , and similarly for the muon and tau initial neutrinos .",
    "the recent model was developed by h .- th .",
    "janka with collaborators who presented us the results of their simulations  @xcite of the o - ne - mg core collapse supernovae which were a continuation of model simulations of refs .",
    "the successful explosion results for this case have recently been independently confirmed by the arizona / princeton sn modelling group  @xcite which found very similar results .",
    "so we were provided with a model whose explosion behavior was comparatively well understood and generally accepted .",
    "we should stress that this o - ne - mg core collapse model ( for the initial stellar mass of @xmath8 ) is not applicable directly to sn1987a which was @xmath9@xmath10 prior to collapse and according to the evolution theory it had a collapsing core which consisted of iron - peak elements .",
    "we integrate over the volume of the neutrino - emitting region @xmath11 to obtain the spectral density of the energy luminosity of a supernova core via right - handed neutrinos :    @xmath12    here , taking the values defined in eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) and the corresponding formulas from appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite , we take in account their dependence on the radius @xmath13 and time @xmath14 .",
    "a comprehensive set of parameter distributions used in our estimation includes the profiles  @xcite of the density @xmath15 , the temperature @xmath16 , the electron fraction @xmath17 , the fractions of electron neutrinos @xmath18 , electron anti - neutrinos @xmath19 , and the fractions @xmath20 for one kind of heavy - lepton neutrino or antineutrino ( @xmath21 ) , which are treated identically",
    ". the time evolution of the parameter distributions is calculated  @xcite within the interval until @xmath22 @xmath23 sec after the collapse . for the sake of illustration , we present in figs .  [ fig : t_r][fig : mup_r ] the radial distributions within the sn core , from @xmath24 to @xmath25 km , at the moment @xmath26 sec after the collapse for the temperature  @xcite , for the chemical potentials of electrons @xmath27 and electron neutrinos @xmath28 ( calculated on the base of the data of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and for the proton nonrelativistic chemical potential @xmath29 defining the degeneracy of protons ( calculated on the base of the data of ref .  @xcite and of the effective nucleon mass @xmath30 in plasma , see ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  152 ) .     within the sn core at the moment @xmath26 sec after the collapse  @xcite.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to analyse the influence of the right - handed neutrino emission on the sn energy loss , we also used the time evolution of the total luminosity of all species of left - handed neutrinos  @xcite , presented in fig .",

    "( [ eq : dl / de_int ] ) over the neutrino energy , one obtains the time evolution of the right - handed neutrino luminosity : @xmath31 this is a novel cooling agent which would have to compete with the energy - loss via active neutrino species in order to affect the total cooling time scale significantly .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath32 signal duration indicates that a novel energy - loss via right - handed neutrinos is bounded by left - handed heutrino luminosity @xmath33 and we believe this estimation to be applicable also to the considered o - ne - mg core collapse model . within the considered time interval until @xmath23 sec after the collapse , one obtains from eqs .",
