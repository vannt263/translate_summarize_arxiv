    "fluid and diffusion limits for queuing systems have been applied successfully toward performance analysis and optimization of various queuing systems .",
    "we are concerned here with performance analysis in steady - state and , more specifically , with brownian steady - state approximations for continuous time markov chains ( ctmcs ) .",
    "the framework of diffusion limits begins with a sequence of ctmcs @xmath2 , and properly scaled and centered versions @xmath3 for some sequence @xmath4 that arises from the specific structure of the model . with appropriate assumptions on the parameters of the ctmc , and on the sequence of initial conditions @xmath5 , one typically proceeds to establish process convergence @xmath6 in the appropriate function space where @xmath7 is a diffusion process .",

    "a central benefit of the limit approach to approximations is the relative tractability of the diffusion @xmath7 relative to the original ctmc .",
    "the convergence rate embedded in the @xmath17 term is not , however , precisely captured by these convergence arguments . in this paper , we prove that an appropriately defined sequence of diffusion models , that are as tractable as the diffusion limit , provides accurate approximations for the steady - state of the ctmcs with an approximation gap that shrinks at a rate of @xmath1 . our approach does not require process convergence as in ( [ eq : fclt ] ) .",
    "we proceed to an informal exposition of the results and key ideas .",
    "the markov chains that we consider have a semi - martingale representation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a local martingale with respect to a properly defined filtration .",
    "we define a fluid model by ( heuristically ) removing the martingale term , that is ,    @xmath20    if the fm has a unique stationary point @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 , it subsequently makes sense to center @xmath23 around @xmath24 and consider the centered and scaled process @xmath25 .",
    "the process @xmath14 satisfies the equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 . under appropriate conditions , a  strong approximation for @xmath28",
    "is given by the diffusion process @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a standard brownian motion and @xmath31 arises naturally from the markov - chain transition functions and is intimately related to the predictable quadratic variation of the martingale @xmath19 .",
    "strong - approximations theory predicts an approximation gap that is logarithmic in @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the time horizon ; see remark  [ rem : strong ] .",
    "a cruder approximation is obtained by replacing the ( state dependent ) diffusion coefficient with its value at the stationary point of the fm , @xmath21 , to obtain the diffusion process specified by the equation    @xmath34    our main finding is that this straightforward heuristic derivation of the dm  building on a stationary point of the fluid model to construct a simplified diffusion model  may provide , insofar as steady - state analysis is concerned , an impressively accurate approximation .",

    "the sequence of poisson equations ( associated with the sequence of dms ) is central to our proofs .",
