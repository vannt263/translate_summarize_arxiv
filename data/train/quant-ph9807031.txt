    "the density matrix of the symmetric top is expressed in terms of the wave functions as follows @xmath115 thus , under two consecutive rotations ( these rotations are determined by the euler angles @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) the hermitian density matrix @xmath118 is transformed as @xmath119 where unitary @xmath120 matrixes @xmath121 and @xmath122 represent these two rotations through the angles @xmath17 and @xmath123 .",
    "since the density matrix under consideration depends on four discrete indices , it is necessary to do two consecutive rotations of the reference frame , which comoving with the top to obtain the diagonal elements of the transformed density matrix . taking into account",
    "this fact , for the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath124 can be reduced to the form @xmath125 here @xmath126 is the above wigner d - function and @xmath127 . in eq .",
    "( [ diagonal ] ) , we assume that summation is performed over the repeated indices @xmath128 , but there is no summation over the indices @xmath129 .",
    "below , we will assume that the hermitian nonnegative density matrix @xmath130 describes not only the pure state of the top ( [ wave!function!top ] ) but also an arbitrary mixed state , i.e. @xmath131 .",
