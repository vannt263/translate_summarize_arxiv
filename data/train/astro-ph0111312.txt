    "the effects of mass segregation in star clusters , with the more massive stars being more centrally concentrated than the lower - mass stars , clearly complicates the interpretation of an observed luminosity function ( lf ) at a given position within a star cluster in terms of its initial mass function ( imf ) . without reliable corrections for the effects of mass segregation , hence for the structure and dynamical evolution of the cluster , it is impossible to obtain a realistic global cluster lf .",
    "dynamical evolution in dense stellar systems , such as galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) and rich large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) star clusters , drives the systems towards energy equipartition , in which the lower - mass stars will attain higher velocities and therefore occupy larger orbits .",
    "consequently , the high - mass stars will gradually sink towards the bottom of the cluster potential , i.e. , the cluster centre ( cf .",
    "spitzer & hart 1971 ) , with the highest - mass stars and those closest to the cluster centre sinking the fastest , although this process is not negligible even at the cluster s edge ( e.g. , chernoff & weinberg 1990 , hunter et al .",
    "this leads to a more centrally concentrated high - mass component compared to the lower - mass stellar population , and thus to dynamical mass segregation .",
    "the time - scale for the onset of significant dynamical mass segregation is comparable to the cluster s dynamical relaxation time ( spitzer & shull 1975 , inagaki & saslaw 1985 , bonnell & davies 1998 , elson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a cluster s characteristic time - scale is may be taken to be its half - mass ( or median ) relaxation time , i.e. , the relaxation time at the mean density for the inner half of the cluster mass for cluster stars with stellar velocity dispersions characteristic for the cluster as a whole ( spitzer & hart 1971 , lightman & shapiro 1978 , meylan 1987 , malumuth & heap 1994 , brandl et al .",
    "1996 ) , and can be written as ( meylan 1987 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the half - mass ( median ) radius ( in pc ) , @xmath11 the total cluster mass , and @xmath12 the typical mass of a cluster star ( both masses in @xmath13 ) .",
    "although the half - mass relaxation time characterises the dynamical evolution of a cluster as a whole , significant differences are expected locally within the cluster . from eq .",
    "( [ trelax.eq ] ) it follows immediately that the relaxation time - scale will be shorter for higher - mass stars ( greater @xmath12 ) than for their lower - mass companions ; numerical simulations of realistic clusters confirm this picture ( e.g. , aarseth & heggie 1998 , see also hunter et al .",
    "1995 , kontizas et al .",
    "1998 ) . from this argument",
    "it follows that dynamical mass segregation will also be most rapid where the local relaxation time is shortest , i.e. , near the cluster centre ( cf .",
    "fischer et al .",
    "1998 , hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "the relaxation time in the core can be written as ( meylan 1987 ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cluster core radius ( in pc ) , @xmath16 ( km s@xmath17 ) the velocity scale , and @xmath18 the mean mass ( in @xmath13 ) of all particles in thermal equilibrium in the central parts .",
    "thus , significant mass segregation among the most massive stars in the cluster core occurs on the local , central relaxation time - scale ( comparable to just a few crossing times , cf .",
    "bonnell & davies 1998 ) , whereas a time - scale @xmath19 is required to affect a large fraction of the cluster mass .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that even the concept of a `` local relaxation time '' is only a general approximation , as dynamical evolution is a continuing process . the time - scale for a cluster to lose all traces of its initial conditions also depends on the smoothness of its gravitational potential , i.e. the number of stars ( bonnell & davies 1998 : larger clusters are inherently smoother , and therefore mass segregation is slower than in smaller clusters with a grainier mass distribution ) , the degree of equipartition reached ( e.g. , hunter et al . 1995 : full global , or even local , equipartition is never reached in a realistic star cluster , not even among the most massive species ) , and the slope of the mf ( e.g. , lightman & shapiro 1978 , inagaki & saslaw 1985 , pryor , smith & mcclure 1986 , sosin 1997 : flatter mass spectra will speed up the dynamical evolution , whereas steep mass spectra will tend to a higher degree of equipartition ) , among others .",
    "in addition , as the more massive stars move inwards towards the cluster centre , their dynamical evolution will speed up , and hence the dynamical relaxation time - scale for a specific massive species is hard to define properly .",
    "this process will be accelerated if there is no ( full ) equipartition ( cf .",
    "inagaki & saslaw 1985 ) , thus producing high - density cores very rapidly , where stellar encounters occur very frequently and binary formation is thought to be very effective ( cf .",
    "inagaki & saslaw 1985 , elson et al .",
    "in fact , the presence of binary stars may accelerate the mass segregation significantly , since two - body encounters between binaries and between binaries and single stars are very efficient ( e.g. , nemec & harris 1987 , de marchi & paresce 1996 , bonnell & davies 1998 , elson et al .",
    "this process will act on similar ( or slightly shorter ) time - scales as the conventional dynamical mass segregation ( cf .",
    "nemec & harris 1987 , bonnell & davies 1998 , elson et al . 1998 ) . in summary ,",
    "the time - scale for dynamical relaxation is a strong function of position within a cluster , and varies with its age .",
    "although a cluster will have lost all traces of its initial conditions on time - scales longer than its characteristic relaxation time , on shorter time - scales the observed stellar density distribution is likely the result of dynamical relaxation and of the way that star formation has taken place .",
    "the process is in fact more complicated , as the high - mass stars evolve on the same time - scale as the lower mass stars ( cf .",
    "aarseth 1999 ) . in order to understand the process of mass segregation in a cluster in detail",
    ", we have to get an idea of the amount of `` primordial '' mass segregation in the cluster .",
    "the nature and degree of primordial mass segregation is presumably determined by the properties of interactions of protostellar material during the star - forming episode in a cluster . in the classic picture of star formation ( shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) ,",
    "interactions are unimportant , and mass segregation does not occur . however , fischer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude that their observations of ngc 2157 seem to indicate the picture in which encounters at the early stages in a cluster s evolution enhance mass accretion due to the merging of protostellar clumps until the mass of these clumps exceeds the initial mass of a star to be formed .",
    "more massive stars are subject to more mergers , hence accrete even more mass ( cf .",
    "larson 1991 , bonnell et al .",
    "2001a , b and references therein ) , and therefore dissipate more kinetic energy .",
    "in addition , they tend to form near the cluster centre , in the highest - density region , where the encounter - rate is highest ( cf .",
    "larson 1991 , bonnell et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 2001a , b , bonnell & davies 1998 ) .",
    "this will lead to an observed position - dependent mf containing more low - mass stars at larger radii compared to the mf in the cluster centre ( although low - mass stars are still present at small radii ) .",
    "this scenario is fully consistent with the idea that more massive stars tend to form in clumps and lower - mass stars form throughout the cluster ( hunter et al .",
    "1995 , brandl et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "although it has been claimed that the observed mass segregation in r136 , the central cluster in the large star forming complex 30 doradus in the lmc , is likely at least partially primordial ( e.g. , malumuth & heap 1994 , brandl et al .",
    "1996 ) its age of @xmath20 34 myr is sufficiently long for at least some dynamical mass segregation , in particular of the high - mass stars in the core ( @xmath21 pc ) , to have taken place ( cf .",
    "malumuth & heap 1994 , hunter et al .",
    "1995 , brandl et al . 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of the high - mass trapezium stars in the centre of the very young orion nebula cluster ( onc ; @xmath22 myr , equivalent to @xmath20 35 crossing times ; bonnell & davies 1998 ) is likely largely due to mass segregation at birth ( bonnell & davies 1998 , based on numerical simulations ; hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 , based on the appearance of the cluster as non - dynamically relaxed , and references therein ) .",
    "bonnell & davies ( 1998 ) show convincingly that the massive stars in the core of the onc most likely originated within the inner 1020% of the cluster .",
    "hillenbrand & hartmann ( 1998 ) argue that the young embedded clusters ngc 2024 and monoceros r2 also show evidence for primordial mass segregation , since the outer regions of these clusters ( and of the onc as well ) are not even one crossing time old .",
    "as part of _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ programme go-7307 , we obtained deep _",
    "wfpc2 _ _ v _ and _ i_-band imaging of 7 rich , compact star clusters in the lmc , covering a large age range . in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2001 ; paper i ) we presented the observational data for the two youngest clusters in our sample , ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 , and discussed the dependence of the lfs on radius within each cluster .",
    "we found clear evidence for luminosity segregation within the inner @xmath23 for both clusters , in the sense that the inner annular lfs showed a relative overabundance of bright stars with respect to the less luminous stellar population compared to the outer annular lfs .    in this paper , we will extend our analysis to the associated mfs and discuss the implications of our results in terms of the imf and the star formation process . in section [ quantification.sec ]",
    "we will derive the mf slopes for both clusters , using a number of mass - to - luminosity ( ml ) conversions discussed in section [ mlrelations.sec ] .",
    "we will take care to only include main sequence stars belonging to the clusters in our final mfs ; to do so , we will exclude the field lmc red giant branch stars from the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , with colours @xmath24 if they are brighter than @xmath25 mag ( see the cmds in johnson et al . 2001 for comparison ) .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from these cmds , the true structure of the hr diagram above the main - sequence turn - off is very complex .",
    "stellar populations of different masses overlap in colour - magnitude space , so that unambiguous mass determination from isochrone fits , for the handful to the few dozen stars populating these areas in each cluster , is highly model - dependent ( cf .",
    "fig . 11 in johnson",
    "et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in a differential analysis such as presented in this paper , the uncertainties involved in their mass determinations are too large and systematic ( i.e. , model dependent ) , so that we can not include these stars in our analysis .",
    "table 1 of paper i contains the fundamental parameters for our two young sample clusters . for the analysis in this paper ,",
    "however , we need to justify our choice for the adopted metallicity , age , and cluster mass in more detail .    1 .   * cluster metallicities *  for ngc 1805 , metallicity determinations are scarce .",
    "johnson et al .

    "we subsequently corrected these estimates of @xmath39 for the presence of a large number of saturated stars in the long cen exposures ( i.e , the observations where we located the cluster centre in the _ wfpc2/pc _ chip ) by comparison with the short cen exposures . although even in the short cen exposures there are some saturated stars ( cf .",

    "chrysovergis et al.s ( 1989 ) determination of @xmath49 is outside our @xmath46 error bar ; we speculate that the difference between our two estimates is due to a combination of the single - mass isotropic king cluster model used by them , versus our photometric mass determination , and a different treatment of the background stellar contribution .",
    "the conversion of an observational lf ( which we determined for ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 in paper i ) , in a given passband _ i _ , @xmath50 , to its associated mf , @xmath51 , is not as straightforward as often assumed .",

    "empirical ml relations are hard to come by , and have so far only been obtained for solar - metallicity stars ( e.g. , popper 1980 ; andersen 1991 ; henry & mccarthy 1993 , hereafter hm93 ; kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 , hereafter ktg93 ) .",
    "the ml relation is , however , a strong function of the stellar metallicity , and one needs to include corrections for hidden companion stars to avoid introducing a systematic bias in the derived mf ( e.g. , ktg93 , kroupa 2000 ) . for the conversion of the present - day mf to the imf",

    "although the ml relation is relatively well - established for stars more massive than @xmath59 , our rather limited understanding of the lower - mass , more metal - poor stars , especially of the boundary conditions between the stellar interior and their atmospheres , have until recently severely limited the applicability of reliable ml relations to obtain robust mfs at the low - mass end .      as shown by eq .",
    "( [ mlrelation.eq ] ) , it is in fact the _ slope _ of the ml relation at a given absolute magnitude that determines the corresponding mass , which is therefore quite model dependent .",

    "1990 , dantona & mazzitelli 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the local maximum in the derivative of the ml relation at @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is caused by the increased importance of the h@xmath66 opacity in low - mass stars with decreasing mass ( ktg93 , kroupa & tout 1997 ) .",
    "the ml relation steepens near @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , due to the increased importance of h@xmath69 formation in the outer shells of main sequence stars , which in turn leads to core contraction ( e.g. , chabrier & baraffe 1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 , kroupa 2000 ) .    given the non - linear shape of the ml relation and the small slope at the low - mass end , any attempt to model the ml relation by either a polynomial fit or a power - law dependence will yield intrinsically unreliable mfs ( cf .",

    "( 1997 ) , who compared the mfs for the gc ngc 6752 derived from a variety of different ml relations at that time available in the literature .      the exact shape of the ml relation is sensitive to metallicity ; metallicity changes affect the stellar spectral energy distribution and therefore the ( absolute ) magnitude in a given optical passband ( cf .",
    "brewer et al . 1993 ) .",
    "in fact , it has been argued ( cf .",

    "[ robustmf.fig ] we introduce a more robust characterisation of the presence of mass segregation in these two young star clusters .",

    "we therefore conclude that we have been able to quantify the effects of mass segregation in a fairly robust way by thus minimising the effects of the choice of ml conversion .",
    "it is most likely that the effect referred to as mass segregation is indeed due to a positional dependence of the ratio of high - mass to low - mass stars within the clusters , and not to different age distributions ( `` age segregation '' ) .",

    "in addition , a comparison between results obtained from star counts and from surface brightness profiles does not necessarily trace the same system , since star counts are generally dominated by main - sequence ( and subgiant - branch ) stars , while surface brightness profiles mostly trace the giants ( and also subgiant stars ) in a cluster ( cf .",

    "therefore , in this case a larger number of two - body encounters , and hence time , is required to reach a dynamically relaxed state .",
    "thus , the relaxation time estimates obtained by considering only the contributions of the cluster s stellar component should be considered lower limits , especially for young star clusters , which are generally rich in gas .",

    "relevant to this discussion is the study by bonnell & davies ( 1998 ) , who found that whenever a system of massive stars is found at the centre of a young star cluster , like the trapezium stars in the onc , a major fraction of it most likely originated in the inner parts of the cluster .",

    "if there is a significant percentage of binary or multiple stars in a star cluster , this will lead us to underestimate the mf slope .",

    "this result does not depend on the mass range used to fit the slopes or the metallicity assumed . in all cases , the larger mass ranges used for the fitting result in steeper mf slopes than the smallest mass range dominated by the lowest - mass stars , thus presenting clear evidence for non - power law shaped mfs . within the uncertainties , we can not claim that the slopes of the outer mfs in ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 are significantly different .",
    "we also argue that our results are consistent with previously published results for these clusters if we properly take the large uncertainties in the conversion of lfs to mfs into account .",
