    "optically thin , two - temperature accretion flows have been considered as an explanation of a variety of black hole systems and a substantial work has been done for investigation of their dynamical and spectral properties ( see , e.g. , narayan & mcclintock 2008 for a review ) .",
    "however , the developed models still involve several approximations which significantly reduce their accuracy .",
    "these involve the use of a pseudo - newtonian potential of paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) , which fails in the innermost region ( particularly if rotation of the black hole is considered ) , where most of the gravitational energy is dissipated , as well as local approximations of comptonization , which appear to be particularly incorrect in optically thin flows ( see xie et al .  2010 ; hereafter x10 ) .",
    "previous attempts to improve these two weaknesses are discussed in section [ previous ] .    in this paper , we extend our previous treatment of global comptonization from x10 by using the hydrodynamical model from manmoto ( 2000 ; hereafter m00 ) , and develop a self - consistent model involving a fully general - relativistic ( gr ) description of both the hydrodynamical and the radiative processes .",
    "we consider moderate values of accretion rate , at which coulomb coupling between ions and electrons is relatively weak compared to the viscous heating of ions and , therefore , the ion temperature ( and hence the total pressure ) is not affected significantly by the details of the description of radiative processes .",
    "this allows for a slightly simplified treatment of the flow structure in our computations leading to a self - consistent solution .",
    "already the foundational papers proposed that tenuous , two - temperature flows may be responsible for the hard spectral states of black - hole binaries ( ichimaru 1977 ; see also narayan & yi 1995 ) and for the low nuclear luminosities in radio galaxies with large radio lobes ( rees et al .  1982 ) .",
    "we consider two ranges of the key parameters ( black hole mass and accretion rate ) which should be relevant for these two major application areas .",
    "for each of these two cases , we illustrate the impact of the black hole spin by considering a non - rotating and a maximally - rotating black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "we neglect here the dependence on some other parameters of hot - flow models .    in particular , we consider only weakly magnetized flows , with the magnetic pressure of 1/10th of the total pressure , and we neglect the direct viscous heating of electrons ; see section [ delta ] for a discussion of these two assumptions .",
    "furthermore , we neglect outflows , which may play an important role in some systems ( e.g.  yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) . then , our solutions are strongly dominated by the advection of energy by ions , as in the original formulation of the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model by , e.g. , narayan & yi ( 1995 ) .    in this paper , we focus on modelling an innermost part of an accretion flow , namely inside @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gravitational radius and @xmath9 is the black - hole mass , where the bulk of the observed radiation is produced .",
    "global comptonization has a net effect of compton heating outside @xmath10 ( e.g.  park & ostriker 2001 , yuan , xie & ostriker 2009 , yuan & li 2011 ) , which effect is not considered here .",
    "we consider a black hole , characterised by its mass , @xmath9 , and angular momentum , @xmath11 , surrounded by a geometrically thick accretion flow with an accretion rate , @xmath12 .",
    "we define the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "the inclination angle of the line of sight to the symmetry axis is given by @xmath18 .",
    "we refine here our previous study presented in x10 by including a fully gr hydrodynamical description of the flow .",
    "our gr hydrodynamical model follows strictly m00 , except for a small difference in the advective term , as noted below equation ( [ eq : qint ] ) .",
    "we have thoroughly tested our hydrodynamical model by comparing it with the numerical code and results of li et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which work also follows m00 .",
    "other differences with respect to x10 involve :    \\(i ) the vertical structure of the flow : we assume here that the temperature and velocity components are vertically uniform , while the density distribution is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the scale height at @xmath21 ; in x10 we assumed a tangentially uniform structure of the flow ;    \\(ii ) the direct viscous heating of electrons , which is neglected here and included in x10 ;    \\(iii ) an outflow , neglected here and included ( with a large magnitude ) in x10 .",
    "we consider the pairs of the main parameters of ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , which correspond to low - luminosity agns and hard states of black - hole binaries , respectively .",
    "for each pair of ( @xmath9 , @xmath26 ) we consider two values of the spin parameter , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we assume the viscosity parameter of @xmath29 and the ratio of the gas pressure ( electron and ion ) to the total pressure of @xmath30 .",
    "the latter parameter determines the strength of the magnetic field in the accretion flow , and the synchrotron emission can then be determined . for it",
    ", we follow the method of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , which was applied also by m00 and x10 .",
    "we define the compressive heating rate of electrons per unit area ( in the local reference frame ) of the flow , @xmath31 and the rate ( per unit area ) of advection of the internal energy of electrons , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass density and @xmath34 is the electron pressure in the midplane , @xmath35 is the effective adiabatic index [ see , e.g. , eq .  ( 62 ) in m00 for the definition ] ; for simplicity of notation we hereafter skip the e subscripts in symbols denoting electron heating / cooling rates .",
    "note that in our definition @xmath36 .",
    "then , @xmath37 is always positive ( therefore , we define it as a heating term ) as the density gradient is always negative in our models . in all models ,",
    "@xmath38 is negative ( representing the release of internal energy ) in the innermost region , at larger distances it is positive ( the internal energy is stored ) or vanishes .",
    "following the usual notation , we define also the electron advection rate , @xmath39 , which is typically negative ( i.e.  the advective effects result in effective heating ) except for an outer ( beyond @xmath40 , see below ) region in the local models .",
    "the above forms of @xmath37 and @xmath38 follow directly from eqs .",
    "( 54 ) and ( 60 ) in m00 .",
    "we do not use the simplifying approximation , @xmath41 , adopted in m00 ; we checked that it yields deviations of the advective term from the actual values by a factor of a few .    with the above definitions , the electron energy equation is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the radiative cooling rate per unit area ( including synchrotron , @xmath44 , and bremsstrahlung , @xmath45 , and their comptonization , @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 is the electron heating rate per unit area by ions via coulomb collisions .    the values of @xmath47 , @xmath37 and @xmath43 integrated over the whole body of the flow",
    "are denoted by @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . due to the effect of capturing by the black hole and the gravitational redshift ( see section [ collimation ] for details ) ,",
    "the total power radiated by the flow , @xmath50 , is higher than the luminosity , @xmath51 , detected far away from the flow .    for completeness we give also the ion energy equation : @xmath52 where the compressive heating and the advection of the internal energy of ions , respectively , are given by @xmath53 and the viscous dissipation rate , per unit area , is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55",
    ", @xmath56 is the ion pressure , @xmath57 is the ion adiabatic index , @xmath58 is the angular velocity of the flow , @xmath59 is the lorentz factor of the azimuthal motion and @xmath60 . the above form of @xmath61 results from the usual assumption that the viscous stress is proportional to the total pressure , with the proportionality coefficient @xmath62 ; cf .  eqs .  ( 48 ) and ( 54 ) in m00 .",
    "this is almost certainly an oversimplified approach ; see gammie & popham ( 1998 ) for a discussion of various issues related to implementing a proper description of the viscous stress in gr models .",
    "the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is now widely believed to be an origin of the viscous stress and numerical simulations of this process ( e.g.  krolik , hawley & hirose 2005 ) show radial profiles of the stress which are different from analytic prescriptions considered in the accretion theory .",
    "the uncertainty regarding the form of the stress is the major shortcoming in attempts to develop an analytical description of accretion flows .",
    "the form of the viscous stress , @xmath63 , is assumed here for computational simplicity .",
    "it has an unphysical property of leading to a negative dissipation rate close to the event horizon in some cases .",
    "however , this particular weakness of our model appears to be not important for our results .",
    "namely , we find that @xmath64 occurs at @xmath65 only in our models with @xmath27 ; in these models the heating of ions is strongly dominated by the compression work at @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , details of the viscous heating of ions do not affect the flow structure .",
    "clearly , the accuracy of @xmath61 would be much more important in models taking into account direct viscous heating of electrons .",
    "our modelling of comptonization makes use of a monte carlo ( mc ) method taking into account all effects relevant for the kerr metric ( niedwiecki 2005 ; see also niedwiecki & zdziarski 2006 and x10 ) .",
    "the seed photons are generated from synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radial emissivities of the flow , taking into account the vertical profile of the density ; their transfer and energy gains in consecutive scatterings are affected by both the special relativistic and gravitational effects .              the mc comptonization simulation and the solution of structure equations are treated separately in our model .",
    "therefore , we have to iterate between their results to find a mutually consistent solution . in principle , a full set of hydrodynamical equations should be solved after each mc simulation , as in x10 .",
    "however , in the current study we apply a slightly simplified procedure , motivated by the fact that the structure of the flow is fully determined by the ion energy equation ( this condition is , however , satisfied only within inner several hundred @xmath67 , see below ) , while the electron energy equation determines the electron temperature .",
    "under such conditions , our procedure of refining the description of compton cooling should affect only the electron temperature and not the other flow parameters ( @xmath68 , @xmath33 , @xmath20 , and the velocity field ) .",
    "then , we first solve the dynamical structure with a local approximation of compton cooling and then we iterate between the mc comptonization results and the solutions of the electron energy equation , keeping the flow parameters , except for @xmath69 , unchanged .",
    "after each mc simulation , we determine the radially - dependent compton cooling .",
    "we then use this rate to solve the energy equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) , taking into account the dependence of all relevant processes ( synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emissivities , coulomb exchange rate , advective terms ) on @xmath69 .",
    "we repeat the above procedure until it converges .    for the initial solution , the outer boundary of the flow",
    "is set at @xmath70 ( see section 2.4 in m00 for details ) .",
    "the mc simulations are performed within @xmath71 , using the hydrodynamical solution at @xmath72 ; note that details of this inner part of the solution should not depend on the outer boundary condition ( see e.g.  fig .  5 in narayan , kato & honma 1997 ) .",
    "for our final solution , we balance the electron energy equation up to @xmath73 . due to boundary effects in mc simulation , combined with strong sensitivity of the advective term on the temperature gradient ,",
    "the solution is very unstable at @xmath21 close to @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , we note that an assumption underlying our computational procedure fails in these outer regions .",
    "namely , all our final solutions are characterised by an electron temperature larger ( typically by a factor of @xmath75 at @xmath76 ) than the initial solutions and the electron pressure can give a non - negligible contribution beyond several hundred @xmath67 .",
    "in that region , the scale height would increase , which effect is not taken into account here ; however , we expect it to be a rather minor , @xmath77 per cent , effect  such a change of @xmath78 was found , in response to a similar in magnitude ( but opposite ) change of @xmath69 , in x10 .",
    "for one set of parameters , namely @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath27 , @xmath69 approaches @xmath68 at @xmath81 , so the flow loses a two - temperature structure .",
    "we skip here more careful investigation of the outer region because it gives a negligible contribution to the observed radiation . furthermore",
    ", a detailed study of the outer region should involve a proper description of additional , poorly understood effects ( like a mechanism of transition from an optically thick disc to a tenuous flow ; e.g. , in hard states such a transition is likely to occur at @xmath82 ) which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "figs [ fig : rates ] and [ fig : rates_stel ] show the change of the heating and cooling rates , and the electron temperature , between our initial and final solutions .",
    "figs [ fig : flow ] and [ fig : flow_stel ] show the remaining parameters of the flow ",
    "these are assumed to be the same in the initial and final solutions .",
    "we can clearly see how the value of the spin parameter , @xmath83 , affects the flow properties .",
    "rotation of the black hole stabilizes the circular motion of the innermost part of the flow ( an effect directly related with properties of test particle motion , analogous to the well - known dependence of the innermost stable orbit on @xmath83 in keplerian discs ) which yields a higher density ( through the continuity equation ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies both a stronger coulomb coupling ( see figs [ fig : rates]f and [ fig : rates_stel]f ) and a larger optical depth ( see figs [ fig : flow]a and [ fig : flow_stel]a ) in the innermost region in models with @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "heating by the compression work is typically stronger than , or comparable to , heating by the coulomb energy transfer from ions ( cf .",
    "nakamura et al .",
    "1997 , mahadevan & quataert 1997 ) , which effect partly reduces the differences between the high and low @xmath83 models .",
    "these effects , and their impact on the radiative properties of the flow , are discussed in detail below .",
    "figs [ fig : rates](f ) and [ fig : rates_stel](f ) show also the dissipative heating rate of ions , @xmath61 .",
    "the stabilized rotation results in a much stronger dissipative heating in the inner region for @xmath28 , however , this property is rather unimportant for effects investigated in this paper ( neglecting both the direct heating of electrons and hadronic processes ) .",
    "we discuss here in some details the initial solutions although they are not self - consistent , because most of models available in literature use the same local approximation for comptonization .",
    "moreover , we amend some conclusions regarding the accuracy of local approximations , derived previously in x10 .",
    "we find the initial solutions using the prescription for the compton cooling rate in a slab geometry with initial photon energies of 1 ev , given in dermer et al .",
    "( 1991 ; hereafter d91 ) . in x10 , we found that it gives a reasonably good approximation for the innermost region .",
    "for the models considered here , the slab approximation appears to be less accurate , however , our choice of the slab case allows for a direct comparison with previous studies , a number of which used the slab approximation based on d91 , or its modification introduced in esin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "figs [ fig : rates](a , c ) and [ fig : rates_stel](a , c ) show the heating and cooling rates in the initial solution .",
    "comptonization of synchrotron photons is the most efficient radiative cooling process .",
    "however , the synchrotron emissivity decreases rapidly beyond its transition radius , @xmath40 ( @xmath84 for @xmath23 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 ) .",
    "then , in the local model , the radiative cooling at @xmath87 is dominated by the ( much weaker ) bremsstrahlung and its comptonization .",
    "then , two regions can be distinguished in terms of the _ electron _ energy equation ( ions are always advection dominated ) .",
    "( i ) at @xmath87 , the flow is adiabatically compressed , which is reflected in the increase of @xmath69 with decreasing @xmath21 ( see figs [ fig : rates]e and [ fig : rates_stel]e ) ; both the radiative cooling and the coulomb heating are much weaker than the advective terms .",
    "( ii ) at @xmath88 , the radiative cooling becomes efficient and @xmath69 decreases ; the coulomb heating is more efficient in this region and it exceeds the compression work in the innermost part ( except for the model with @xmath27 and @xmath89 ) . in this region , the advection of the internal energy contributes also to the heating of electrons , however , this effect is rather weak .",
    "the solid curves in figs [ fig : rates](a , c ) and [ fig : rates_stel](a , c ) show the gr global compton cooling rate obtained in our initial mc simulations , i.e.  with the @xmath69 satisfying the energy equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) with the compton cooling rate , @xmath90 , given by the local slab ( d91 ) prescription .",
    "as we can see , there are significant deviations between the local ( dotted curves ) and global cooling rates , resulting from several effects .",
    "two of these effects should be generic to models of black - hole flows regardless of specific values of parameters of the flow .",
    "first , the input of seed photons from the inner region strongly enhances the compton cooling beyond @xmath40 .",
    "the second one involves the presence of the event horizon ( neglected in the local approximation ) .",
    "the presence of an inner boundary of the flow at the event horizon results in an obvious difference with respect to the semi - infinite slab ; namely , a large fraction of photons generated in the innermost region is captured , reducing the input of seed photons .",
    "another effect affecting the structure of the flow is the dependence of the optical depth from a given point on direction .",
    "this strongly depends on the flow parameters and assumptions about heating and outflow .",
    "in particular , the flows for our parameters have the optical depth from a point in the equatorial plane along the outward radial direction , @xmath91 , similar to the vertical one , @xmath92 , at any @xmath21 , whereas @xmath93 in the model of x10 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath28 , both @xmath91 and @xmath92 are much smaller than the optical depth in the inward radial direction , @xmath94 , except for the very innermost region ; in these models @xmath95 ( @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath4 for @xmath80 ) at @xmath98 . for @xmath27 , @xmath95 ( @xmath99 for @xmath97 and @xmath100 for @xmath80 ) at @xmath101 ; in these models the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath91 typically does not exceed a factor of 2 .",
    "then , for a non - rotating black hole , the local radiative properties would be more accurately described by the spherical geometry , while for a rapidly rotating black hole the local properties are intermediate between the sphere and the slab .",
    "then , the assumption of the slab geometry overestimates the initial cooling rate in all models considered here .",
    "finally , as we note in x10 , the d91 formula is accurate for only two values of seed photon energies , 1 ev and 1 kev , and we use here the lower one . with this value",
    ", the formula gives a reasonable approximation for flows around a stellar black hole , where seed photons have energies @xmath102 ev . for flows around a supermassive black hole , however , with typical seed photon energies of @xmath1 ev ( for @xmath103 ) , it underestimates the cooling rate .",
    "specifically , for this @xmath9 we found deviations by a factor of @xmath104 between the formula of d91 for 1 ev and the results of our _ local _ slab mc simulation using the exact energy distribution of seed photons ( given by the synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission distributions ; see x10 for the description of our local mc model ) .",
    "the initial solutions are qualitatively similar at both values of @xmath26 considered here , the most significant dependence on @xmath105 involves the increase of the value of @xmath40 with increasing @xmath26 . in contrary , detailed properties of the self - consistent , final solutions are more sensitive to @xmath26 .",
    "figs [ fig : rates](b , d ) show the heating and cooling rates of the final solutions for @xmath23 . at @xmath106 , a significant fraction of the power heating electrons",
    "is stored as their internal energy rather than radiated away .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the initial solution , although @xmath43 is larger at @xmath106 in the global cooling model and hence @xmath38 is smaller than in the local cooling model ; therefore , the temperature gradient is smaller in the outer region in our final solutions ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we note that the strong contribution of the @xmath38 term significantly complicates the procedure for finding the self - consistent solution at this lower @xmath26 , as both the global compton cooling and the electron advection are strongly sensitive to , and affect , the electron temperature profile .",
    "[ fig : rates](e ) shows the electron temperature profiles for the initial and the final solutions .",
    "we see that , in the final solution , @xmath69 increases compared to the initial solution , by a factor of @xmath107 in the inner region , and up to a factor of 3 at several hundred @xmath67 .",
    "the increase of @xmath69 at @xmath108 is an obvious effect , related with the overestimation of the cooling rate by the slab approximation , combined with - crucial in that region - capturing of seed photons by the black hole , as discussed in section [ initial ] .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the global solution requires higher @xmath69 also at @xmath109 , where the global radiative cooling is significantly enhanced .",
    "the temperature must remain high in this outer region because the energy balance could not be achieved for @xmath69 decreasing too rapidly .",
    "namely , we found that such a ( too rapid ) decrease of temperature at @xmath109 would yield a large positive @xmath110 term in the electron energy equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) , which , added to the ( increased in global cooling ) @xmath43 term , could not be balanced by the heating terms .",
    "we emphasise that this property is related to strong contribution of advective terms and it should not necessarily occur in the whole range of parameters , in particular at higher accretion rates .    for @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rates_stel ] ) , the self - consistent @xmath69 is higher in the innermost part than @xmath69 in the initial solution , due to the same reasons as for @xmath23 .",
    "however , the compton cooling is relatively more important in the outer region , which results in an approximately isothermal structure at @xmath111 ; in particular , we do not find a local maximum of @xmath69 , marking the transition ( at @xmath112 ) from an adiabatically compressed flow to an efficiently cooled flow in global solutions with @xmath23 and in all our local solutions .",
    "the temperature at which the energy balance is achieved is twice lower for @xmath28 , due to a much larger input of seed photons from the central region .",
    "the strong contribution of the compressive heating has crucial consequences for the radiative efficiency , @xmath113 , where @xmath51 is the total observed luminosity of the flow , and for its scaling with @xmath26 .",
    "we compare here our models with the same @xmath83 for different @xmath26 , although we note that they have also different @xmath9 , which may slightly affect such a comparison ( the main dependence on the value of @xmath9 concerns the energy of synchrotron photons , influencing the cooling rate ) . comparing our results for @xmath23 and 0.5 , we find that the fraction of an accretion power transferred to electrons via coulomb collisions varies approximately as @xmath114 for @xmath28 and for @xmath27 we note even stronger dependence on @xmath26",
    ". then , heating dominated by the coulomb coupling would lead to an approximately linear scaling of the radiative efficiency with @xmath26 , as derived in previous works on this subject ( see , e.g. , eq .  12 and references in narayan & mcclintock 2008 ; see also table 3 in rajesh & mukhopadhyay 2010 ) .",
    "however , @xmath115 is much less dependent , moreover negatively , on @xmath26 ; specifically , it is higher by a factor of @xmath104 for @xmath23 than for @xmath25 . as a result",
    ", the dependence of @xmath116 on @xmath26 is significantly reduced .    for @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath117 at @xmath23 and @xmath118 at @xmath25 . the decrease of @xmath115 with increasing @xmath26 is partially balanced by the increased contribution of coulomb heating .",
    "two further effects decrease the radiative efficiency at lower @xmath26 : ( 1 ) the increase of the fraction of the energy given to electrons which is not radiated away ( and increases the internal energy advected with the flow ) , and ( 2 ) the increase of the fraction of photons captured by the black hole ( section [ collimation ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the radiative efficiency for @xmath27 is approximately the same for both considered values of @xmath26 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath119 ( with @xmath120 erg s@xmath121 and @xmath122 ) for @xmath23 and @xmath123 ( @xmath124 erg s@xmath121 and @xmath125 ) for @xmath25 .    for @xmath28 , @xmath48 exceeds @xmath49 at both @xmath23 and 0.5 .",
    "radiative efficiencies at these @xmath26 differ only by a factor of 2 , due to relatively stronger contribution of compressive heating at @xmath23 and very strong reduction of the observed @xmath51 by gr effects ( section [ collimation ] ) at @xmath25 .",

    "the x - ray spectra are relatively hard , with the photon index @xmath134 , for both ( @xmath23 , @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath25 , @xmath27 ) and @xmath135 for ( @xmath25 , @xmath28 ) ; the last value is determined in the 210 kev range , as at higher energies a rather pronounced wien peak leads to further hardening of the spectrum . for ( @xmath136 , @xmath27 ) , the relativistic @xmath69 and small optical depth result in pronounced scattering bumps seen in this model spectrum ;",
    "the average slope in the 2200 kev range is @xmath137 .",

    "however , this simple solution introduces inaccuracies of up to an order of magnitude even for the basic flow parameters ( e.g. , the density given by eq .  1 in mahadevan & quataert ( 1997 ) is @xmath183 times larger than the density in our solutions ) , which leads to further inaccuracies in papers based on this model",

    "it appears that the model of narayan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) yields a higher cooling rate than our monte carlo model , as the spectrum computed in esin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for parameters similar to these in our models ( see the solid curve in their fig",
    ".  1 ) has a break energy at @xmath184 kev , significantly lower than our model spectra .",

    "the fully gr adaf model of kurpiewski & jaroszyski ( 1999 , 2000 ) , with a mc computation of global comptonization , seems to be the closest to our present work .",
    "their spectra show a much stronger dependence on @xmath83 , see e.g.  figure 4 in kurpiewski & jaroszyski ( 2000 ) , which may be due to their values of @xmath26 significantly smaller than in our models .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used an iteration method , similar to ours but with a different approach to computing global comptonization , to find the radiative cooling rate mutually consistent between the dynamics and radiation of the flow in a non gr model including strong outflows and electron heating .",
    "taking into account significant differences between the results of our present work and x10 , pointed out below , we speculate that gr flows with a different strength of these two effects may be characterised by different critical accretion rates , and different maximum luminosities , than those found in the model of yuan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the pseudo - relativistic model of x10 .",
    "first , we note that models based on the pseudo - newtonian potential fail to properly describe the innermost region even for the @xmath27 case .",
    "specifically , the pseudo - relativistic model predicts a decrease of the optical depth at @xmath185 ( see the dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "2b in x10 ) while the fully gr model with the same parameters ( see our fig .",
    "[ fig : flow]a ) yields the optical depth monotonically increasing with decreasing @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy can be traced to the ( unphysically ) large radial velocity in the pseudo - relativistic model , formally exceeding @xmath186 at small @xmath21 , which implies a much smaller density than that in the gr model .",
    "second , in the present work we use the equation for vertical equilibrium in the form derived for the kerr metric by abramowicz , lanza & percival ( 1997 ) .",
    "in x10 we used its simplified version , @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the sound speed and @xmath189 is the keplerian angular velocity , and we note significant differences in scale heights derived in these two approaches . specifically , the equation from abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) yields a larger scale height , up to a factor of @xmath190 , for the flow parameters describing our models .",
    "third , additional effects included in x10 , namely the strong outflow and direct viscous heating of electrons affect the flow structure in a complex manner and lead to a qualitatively different effect of taking into account the global nature of the comptonization process . obviously , the outflow leads to a reduction of @xmath191 at small @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , @xmath191 is much smaller , by a factor of @xmath183 at @xmath66 , in the model of x10 than in our present model with @xmath27 and @xmath25 ( which parameters are the same as those in x10 ) .",
    "then , the outflow reduces the compressive heating of ions via reducing the density gradient , and the direct heating of the electrons reduces the viscous heating of ions .",
    "also , the outflow reduces the viscous heating rate per unit volume , flattening its radial profile , but the viscous heating rate per ion remains unchanged .",
    "we note that the compressive heating of ions exceeds their viscous heating in our models , and it is much larger , by a factor of @xmath192 , than the compressive heating of electrons .",
    "together , both reductions of the ion heating cause a reduction of @xmath68 , which , in turn , leads to a decrease of @xmath78 by @xmath193 per cent ( with respect to the pseudo - relativistic model without both an outflow and electron heating ) within the innermost several @xmath67 .    the simplified hydrostatic equilibrium condition together with the outflow and electron heating considered in x10 yield a much smaller @xmath78 than our present model ( compare our fig .",
    "[ fig : flow_stel]b with fig .",
    "3b in x10 ) . as a result , in spite of the strong mass loss to the outflow , the total _ radial _",
    "optical depth in the model of x10 is still higher than that in our model with @xmath27 and @xmath25 .",
    "also , the radial optical depth of x10 is much larger than @xmath191 ; then , the geometry of the flow resembles that of a slab .",
    "fourth , comparing the radiative efficiencies of the x10 model and the present one with @xmath27 , @xmath25 illustrates the strong impact of the direct heating of electrons .",
    "namely , in x10 the value of @xmath116 is three times larger , although most of the potential energy of the flow is lost to the outflow in their model .",
    "we discuss here briefly our assumption on the strength of the magnetic field as well as our neglect of the viscous heating of electrons .",
    "our assumption of rather weak magnetic field , with the magnetic pressure of @xmath194 , is supported by results of the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations in which amplification of magnetic fields by the mri typically saturates at such a ratio of the magnetic to the total pressure ( e.g.  machida , nakamura & matsumoto 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "it is rather easy to assess changes of the flow structure and the spectrum resulting from a change of this assumption .",
    "namely , a stronger magnetic field would result in a stronger synchrotron emission and this would cause a decrease of the electron temperature and a softening of the comptonization spectrum ( see , e.g. , esin et al .  1997 ) .",
    "an issue of the direct viscous heating of electrons is more uncertain .",
    "current applications of adaf models typically assume large values of electron heating to total heating , @xmath195 ( e.g. , yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) , however , the model has a degeneracy between the value of @xmath196 and the strength of an outflow ( quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "various attempts to assess this effect on theoretical grounds seem to favour small values of @xmath196 for weak magnetic fields and rather high @xmath26 , which are considered in our models . analytic investigation of particle heating by mhd turbulence in adafs indicates that the turbulence primarily heats protons for weak magnetic fields , while electrons are primarily heated for strong magnetic fields ( see quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "however , large uncertainties in the division between electron and proton heating result from uncertainties in the description of the turbulence ; @xmath197 , assumed in our models , may correspond to the values of @xmath196 between @xmath198 and 0.6 ( see fig .  2 in quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "details of another potential mechanism of electron heating discussed by bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace ( 1997 ) and quataert & gruzinov ( 1999 ) , i.e.  reconnection , remain even more uncertain .",
    "simulations of mri turbulence by sharma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) indicate that pressure anisotropy , created in turbulent plasmas , may give an additional mechanism for particle heating ; they approximate the fraction of the viscous energy which heats electrons as @xmath199 .",
    "however , their model assumes a fully collisionless plasma , which approximation is valid only for @xmath200 . at higher accretion rates ,",
    "coulomb collisions suppress the electron pressure anisotropy and electron heating is negligible .",
    "then , their prescription for @xmath196 seems to be not relevant for our models .",
    "we note that the direct viscous heating would exceed the coulomb and compressive heating of electrons for @xmath201 in models with @xmath27 , and for @xmath202 in models with @xmath28 . for these values of @xmath196",
    ", flows should have larger luminosities than these assessed in our models .",
    "we can also expect that flows with such values of @xmath196 produce harder x - ray spectra , with higher cut - off energies , than obtained in our models .",
    "however , we note also that large values of @xmath196 , for which the heating of ions is significantly reduced , may have a strong impact on the flow structure , especially if a strong outflow is also present , which may lead to enhanced global compton cooling ( as discussed in section [ previous ] ) .",
    "then , the above simple estimation of spectral changes related to the increase of @xmath196 may be incorrect ; in particular , we note that the spectrum obtained in our model with @xmath203 in x10 has a smaller cut - off energy than our spectra computed here with @xmath204 .",
    "a substantial observational evidence indicates that accretion flows typically proceed through a radiatively - inefficient mode below a characteristic luminosity of @xmath205 in agns ( e.g. , ho 2008 ; see yuan 2007 for a review on the applications of hot flow models to low luminosity agns ) .",
    "fr i radio galaxies make an interesting class of objects observed at such luminosities .",
    "they do not show signs of the presence of an optically thick accretion disc ( e.g. , chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) .",
    "remarkably , an average radiative efficiency , @xmath206 , estimated for fr is by balmaverde , baldi & capetti ( 2008 ) is consistent with the values of @xmath116 obtained in most of our solutions .    according to our results , hot flows with relevant accretion rates",
    "should produce rather hard spectra , extending to mev energies .",
    "then , mev observations are crucial for verification whether the high energy component is produced by the thermal comptonization in a hot flow ; however , the present data quality in this energy range is too poor for most objects to allow for such analysis .",
    "thanks to its proximity , centaurus a is the best studied fr i radio galaxy , suitable for detailed testing of various accretion models through modelling of its broadband spectrum .",
    "its x - ray luminosity ( @xmath207 , see below , where @xmath208 is the 210 kev luminosity ) satisfies the criterion , suggested in wu , yuan & cao ( 2007 ) , for a fr i galaxy to be dominated by a hot flow rather than a jet emission , of @xmath209 . indeed , many works attributed its spectral components to emission from accretion flow ( e.g.  evans et al .  2004 ; whysong & antonucci 2004 ; meisenheimer et al .",

    "thus , it appears highly unlikely that the x - ray jet emission would start to dominate the accretion - flow emission below about the same eddington ratio in both black - hole binaries and agns ( see also yuan & cui 2005 ; yuan , yu & ho 2009 ) .    the second possibility explaining the form of the @xmath51-@xmath230 correlation discussed by sobolewska et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and independently by veledina et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , is that it is due to a change of the character of the dominant seed photons for comptonization .",
    "the overall idea follows the model for spectral changes of black - hole binaries developed by esin et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) , whose model did predict the changing @xmath51-@xmath230 correlation , see , e.g , fig .  1 in esin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . at high @xmath51 , above the transition @xmath172 , the seed photons are likely to be from an optically - thick disc overlapping with the hot flow .",
    "there is a lot of observational evidence for the presence of an outer cold disc in luminous hard states ( as summarized by done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) , e.g. , a strong correlation of @xmath230 with the relative strength of compton reflection ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ) . also , the inner disc radius decreases with the increasing @xmath51 ( e.g. , done et al .",
    "this naturally explains the positive @xmath51-@xmath230 correlation , since the resulting increasing overlap between the cold disc and the hot flow leads to both an increase of the strength of compton reflection and increased cooling of the comptonizing plasma , resulting in softening of the x - ray spectra .",
    "however , at low @xmath172 , the outer disc may be truncated far away , and the dominant source of seed photons for comptonization becomes synchrotron emission , as in the models studied in this work as well as in the adaf model in general ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "this model can also explain the correlation of the x - rays with the near - infrared / optical emission , which , in this scenario , would be from the adaf flow , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_stel ] .",
    "as shown in section [ final ] , our models spectra do harden with the increasing @xmath51 , with @xmath234 for @xmath51 increasing by a factor of several .",
    "this strongly supports the suggestion of sobolewska et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that the negative @xmath51-@xmath230 correlation seen at @xmath235 is due to the dominance of synchrotron seed photons in that regime .",
    "a hardening of the adaf spectra with increasing @xmath51 , below a few per cent of @xmath236 , was studied previously by esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; their model seems to predict a much stronger effect , with the increase of @xmath26 by a factor of 10 corresponding to @xmath237 . in this work ,",
    "we have considered only two values of the accretion rate , and have not fully tested this model against observational data .",
    "we will consider this issue in detail in a paper in preparation .",
    "we note that oda et al .",
    "( 2010 ) propose another possible explanation for the difference between the low and high luminosity hard states .",
    "it is a transition between two equilibrium states of an optically thin , two temperature flow with a weak and a strong magnetic field , respectively .",
    "such a change of magnetic field is outside the scope of our model .",
    "we have developed a fully gr model with global compton scattering of hot , tenuous accretion flows .",
    "the dominant source of seed photons in our model is the synchrotron process .",
    "we assume that an outer , optically - thick , accretion disc is truncated at large radii , so irradiation of the hot flow by it is negligible .",
    "we have also neglected direct viscous electron heating and outflows .",
    "we have considered the accretion rates of @xmath97 and 0.5 , for which our model gives the bolometric luminosities of @xmath227@xmath228 .    in this range of @xmath172",
    ", we find our models predict x - ray spectra hardening with increasing @xmath51 , which is in agreement with the correlation observed at @xmath235 in both black - hole binaries in the hard state and agns .",
    "this is also in agreement with the suggestion of sobolewska et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that synchrotron seed photons dominate in this range of @xmath172 , whereas an optically - thick accretion disc overlapping with the hot flow provide dominant source of seed photons at higher @xmath51 .",
    "we have compared our models to the low-@xmath51 fr i radio galaxy cen a. we have found a good agreement with the observed x - ray spectral slope , but the position of the high - energy break , observed at @xmath217200 kev , is lower than the model cut - off energy .",
    "this may be possibly explained by the hadronic processes , which would be present if the black hole in this source has a high spin .",
    "we have studied the impact of the black hole spin and we find that despite a very strong influence of this parameter on the dynamical properties of the inner part of the flow , the difference between the observed radiation from a flow surrounding a maximally rotating and a non - rotating black hole , with other parameters unchanged , is rather moderate . in particular , their luminosities differ only by a factor of 23 ( i.e.  smaller than a factor of @xmath238 in keplerian discs ) .",
    "we find this is due to a strong role of the compressive electron heating , which process only weakly depends on the black - hole spin .",
    "we note , however , that a much larger dependence on the spin value is expected in models involving direct heating of electrons , or taking into account hadronic processes .",
    "we stress that a proper treatment of global compton scattering is crucial for accurate modelling of the flow structure , most importantly , for the electron temperature profile , and for the spectral formation in optically thin flows . in models with @xmath80 , we find the entire inner flow is efficiently cooled by comptonization when the non - local nature of this process is taken into account . at @xmath97 ,",
    "global comptonization is important , but also electron advection effects are strong at @xmath239 , giving rise to large temperature gradients . as compared to the results with the global comptonization ,",
    "the local model assuming a slab geometry provides in general a very poor approximation , overestimating the cooling rate by an order of magnitude in the innermost region .",
