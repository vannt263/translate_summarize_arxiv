    "the determination of the fermi surface is a fundamental key ingredient for the understanding of the physical properties of metals .",
    "quantum oscillation experiments , such as de haas van alphen ( dhva ) or shubnikov de haas ( sdh ) , are powerful experimental tools to probe the topology of the fermi surface by detecting the extreme orbits of the electrons and determining their effective masses . these effects can be observed in high quality samples at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields .",
    "both , dhva and sdh , are standard methods to determine the fermi surface properties in strongly correlated electron systems . while in simple metals like al ,",
    "be , in , or zn quantum oscillations in the thermoelectric power ( tep ) have been reported already more than forty years ago ( see e.  g.  ref . and references therein ) , their observation in strongly correlated electron systems is rather new @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of tep quantum oscillations is different from that of the more conventional thermodynamic or transport measurements , dhva and sdh . in thermodynamic probes like specific heat , magnetization , but also in sdh , the oscillations are directly linked to the oscillations of the density of states @xmath2 and the amplitude of the oscillations follows the lifshitz - kosevich theory @xcite .",
    "the unique aspect of tep is that it contains information on both transport and thermodynamic properties of the system which makes the interpretation rather difficult . in a metal",
    "the tep depends on the logarithmic energy derivative of the electronic conductivity according to the mott formula@xcite .",
    "it is thus dependent on the energy derivative of the density of states which is related to the electronic entropy per charge carrier , but also on the energy dependence of the scattering time which is a transport property .",
    "both contributions can contribute to the oscillatory part of the thermoelectric power under magnetic field.@xcite    in the present article we discuss the thermoelectric power in the ferromagnet uge@xmath0 with the main focus on the analysis of the observed quantum oscillations .",
    "uge@xmath0 has gained special attention as pressure induced superconductivity coexists with the ferromagnetic order below the critical pressure @xmath3 gpa where the ferromagnetism is suppressed @xcite . compared to the other uranium based ferromagnetic superconductors , excellent single crystals of this system can be grown and thus the system plays a key role in the research of unconventional superconductivity . furthermore , uge@xmath0 is now a paradigm for the study of ferromagnetic quantum criticality with the emergence of ferromagnetic wings structure @xcite .",
    "uge@xmath0 crystallizes in the orthorhombic zrga@xmath0 type crystal structure ( space group @xmath4 ) with antiphase zigzag chains of u atoms along the @xmath1 axis @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure presents a strong magnetic anisotropy @xcite with the magnetic moments aligned along the zigzag chains ( @xmath1 axis ) which is the easy magnetization axis . at ambient pressure uge@xmath0 orders",
    "ferromagnetically at @xmath5  k. in the temperature range from 20  k to 35  k a cross - over from a high temperature weakly polarized fm1 to a low temperature strongly polarized ferromagnetic phase fm2 is observed in several quantities , but at ambient pressure no signature of a phase transition is observed @xcite . as function of pressure the magnetic moment determined by bulk magnetization measurements jumps from @xmath6u in the fm2 phase to @xmath7u in the weakly polarized fm1 state by a first order transition at @xmath8  gpa at @xmath9.@xcite at finite temperature this first order transition ends at a critical end point ( @xmath10  k and @xmath11  gpa ) @xcite .",
    "thus the crossover fm1 ",
    "fm2 at zero pressure is reminiscent of the critical end point . from measurements of the magnetic form factor by neutron scattering@xcite and also from muon spin rotation and relaxation ( @xmath12sr ) @xcite it has been concluded that the magnetic moment responsible for bulk magnetic properties is localized on the u site and the diffuse component arising from conduction electrons is small .",
    "furthermore , a positron annihilation study suggests that the 5@xmath13-electron itinerant description does not apply to the paramagnetic phase of uge@xmath0.@xcite in difference to this localized picture the observation of large cyclotron effective masses in quantum oscillation experiments @xcite shows that the 5@xmath13 electrons can not be considered as fully localized , and the nature of the u 5@xmath13 state is still controversial and might be described by a duality model with two - subset electronic systems of localized and itinerant character , respectively .",
    "@xcite a dual nature of the 5@xmath13 electrons has been supported in refs .  .",
    "conversely , a recent angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy using soft x - rays suggests that the u 5@xmath13 electrons participate to quasi - particle bands and show an itinerant character in the paramagnetic ( pm ) state , even up to 120  k @xcite .",
    "the pressure induced superconductivity is discussed in an itinerant electron picture.@xcite depending on the experimental probe localized or itinerant character will be revealed .",

    "only small fermi surface branches have been detected for a magnetic field along the @xmath1 axis . in high pressure experiments at each transition , from strongly polarized fm2 state to weakly polarized fm1 , and from fm1 to pm state , abrupt fermi surface changes have been observed @xcite with strong feedback on the magnetic and superconducting properties @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present quantum oscillations which have been observed for magnetic field @xmath16 axis in the thermolelectric power .",
    "these will be compared to sdh experiments performed on the same single crystal . while huge quantum oscillations appear in the tep , only very tiny oscillations",
    "could be observed in the magnetoresistance .",
    "different approaches to analyze the strong tep quantum oscillations will be discussed .    finally , we present new band structure calculations for a polarization along the @xmath1 axis and compare the observed quantum oscillation frequencies to the calculated fermi surface . however , the agreement is still not satisfying indicating the difficulty of electronic structure calculations with 5@xmath13 bands contributions at the fermi level notably for low symmetry crystals such as the orthorhombic uge@xmath0 . in the class of discovered fm superconductors ( uge@xmath0",

    "<S> we present thermoelectric power and resistivity measurements in the ferromagnet uge@xmath0 as a function of temperature and magnetic field . at low temperature , huge quantum oscillations are observed in the thermoelectric power as a function of the magnetic field applied along the @xmath1 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies of the extreme orbits are determined and an analysis of the cyclotron masses is performed following different theoretical approaches for quantum oscillations detected in the thermoelectric power . they are compared to those obtained by shubnikov - de haas experiments on the same crystal and previous de haas - van alphen experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of the different probes confirms thermoelectric power as an excellent probe to extract simultaneously both microscopic and macroscopic information on the fermi - surface properties . </S>",
    "<S> band - structure calculations of uge@xmath0 in the ferromagnetic state are compared to the experiment . </S>"
