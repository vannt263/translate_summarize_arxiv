    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , as one of the most important consequences of dirac s theory for particles in solid state physics , is widely believed to play an important role for establishing electronic devices such as spintronic transistors.@xcite by varying the single - particle properties of materials with sufficiently large spin - orbit coupling , typical response quantities such as the conductivity or the dielectric function can be controlled in an efficient way.@xcite the latter is not only necessary in understanding screening of extrinsic charged impurities , which in turn is important for transport , but also because of the existence of collective charge excitations known as plasmons.@xcite    many analytical and numerical studies have been made in the last years regarding the dielectric properties of electron@xcite and hole gas systems@xcite or promising materials like graphene.@xcite as has been shown in recent works , large analytical progress could be made in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) including the effect of an asymmetric confinement , the rashba soc , and the contribution due to bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) , the so called dresselhaus soc,@xcite or in graphene including several types of spin - orbit interactions ( sois).@xcite due to the more complicated nature of the valence bands , the calculation of the dielectric function in hole gas systems turns out to be a formidable task even without sois .",

    "another important difference between gaas and inas is that the @xmath62-point energy of the first excited heavy hole state , i.e. , @xmath96 , is much smaller than that of the ground state light hole band , @xmath97 .",
