    "blazars , a special class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , exhibit that the continuum emission , which arise from the jet emission taking place in agn whose jet axis is closely aligned with the observer s line of the sight , is dominated by nonthermal emission as well as rapid and large amplitude variability(urry & padovani 1995 ) . the broad spectral energy distributions ( sed ) from the radio to the @xmath0-rays bands",
    "is dominated by two components , indicating two humps .",
    "it is widely admitted that the first hump is produced from electron synchrotron radiation , the peaks range from the infrared - optical up to x - rays regime for different blazars ( urry 1998 ) .",
    "the second hump , the peaks in the gev to tev @xmath0-ray band , probably is produced from inverse compton scattering of the relativistic electrons either on the synchrotron photons(maraschi et al .",
    "1992 ) or on some other photon populations(dermer et al . 1993 ; sikora et al .",
    "1994 ) . as a open issue",
    ", high energy @xmath0-ray is produced by mesons and leptons through the cascade initiated by proton - proton or proton - photon interactions(e.g .",
    "mannheim & biermann 1992 ; mannheim 1993 ; phol & schlickeiser 2000 ; aharonian 2000 ; m@xmath1cke & protheroe 2001 ) .",
    "observations of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray indicate that more than 40 blazars radiate @xmath0-rays in the tev energy regions(e.g .",
    "aharonian et al .",
    "2005 ; cui 2007 ; wagner 2008 ) .",
    "it is believed that the primary tev photons from the distant tev blazars should exhibit clear signatures of absorption due to theirs interactions with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) to produce electron - positron(@xmath2)(e.g .",
    "nikishov 1962 ; gould & schreder 1966 ) .",
    "however , the observed spectra do not show a sharp cutoff at energies around 1 tev ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ; costamante et al .",
    "2008 ; acciari et a. 2009 ) .",
    "one characteristic case was the very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray emissions in distant blazar 1es 1101 - 232 , which detected by the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) array of cherenkov telescopes(aharonian et al .",
    "2006a ; 2007a ) . the vhe @xmath0-rays data result in very hard intrinsic spectra with a peak in the sed above 3 tev , through corrected for absorption by the lowest level ebl ( aharonian et al .",
    "a similar behavior has also been detected in other tev blazars such as 1es 0229 + 200 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2007b ) , 1es 0347 - 121 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2007c ) and mkn 501 ( neronov et al .",
    "2011 ) .    generally , the lack of absorption features either are simplest to assume that there is no absorption ( kifune 1999 ; stecker & glashow 2001 ; de angelis et al .",
    "2009 ) or can be explained by the lower levels of ebl(aharonian et al .",
    "2006b ; mazin & raue 2007 ; finke & razzaque 2009 ) .",
    "alternatively , the hard spectra can be expected , if the @xmath0-rays from distant blazars may be dominated by secondary @xmath0-rays produced along the line of sight by the interactions of cosmic rays protons with the background photons(essey & kusenko 2010 ; essey et al .",
    "2010 ; essey et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are believed to be the most powerful sources of both @xmath0-rays and cosmic rays .",
    "the recently observed results by cherenkov telescopes indicated that interactions of cosmic rays emitted by distant blazars with photon background along the line of sight can produce @xmath0-rays ( essey & kusenko 2009 ) .",
    "motivated by above arguments , in this paper , we study the possible origin of hard spectra in tev blazars .",
    "the high energy emission from tev blazars consists of two components : one , the primary @xmath0-rays component , come from the source , and the other , secondary @xmath0-rays component , come from proton interactions with the ebl photons along the line of sight .    throughout the paper",
    ", we assume the hubble constant @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , the matter energy density @xmath5 , the radiation energy density@xmath6 , and the dimensionless cosmological constant @xmath7 .",
    "we basically follow the traditional synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model to produce the primary @xmath0-rays component and use the method given by kelner & aharonial ( 2008 ) to produce the secondary @xmath0-rays component . now",
    ", we give a brief description on the model      the homogeneous ssc radiation model is widely used for explaining the multi - wavelength energy spectra of blazars .",
    "the homogeneous ssc radiation model that we adopt assumes a spherical radiation region filled with extreme - relativistic electrons , in which the randomly - originated homogeneous magnetic field and constant electron number density exist .",
    "we adopt a broken power - law function with a sharp cut - off to describe the electron energy distribution in the radiation region : @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is the lorentz factor of electron and @xmath10 .",
    "based on the above electron number density @xmath11 , we can use the formulae given by katarzynski et al .",

    "the compton photons may produce pairs by interacting with the synchrotron photons , this process may be decrease the observed high energy radiation ( coppi & blandford 1990 ; finke et al .",
    "katarzynski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyze the absorption effect due to pair - production inside the source , they found that its process is almost negligible . on the other hand , very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-photons from the source",
    "are attenuated by photons from the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "therefore , after taking the absorption effect , the flux density observed at the earth becomes @xmath21\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the absorption optical depth due to interactions with the ebl ( kneiske et al .",
    "2004 ; dwek & krennrich 2005 ) . in our calculation",
    ", we use the absorption optical depth which is deduced by the average ebl model in dwek & krennrich ( 2005 ) .",
    "agns are expected to accelerate cosmic rays to energies up to @xmath23 gev . for energies below greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff of about 50 eev ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 )",
    ", the cosmic rays can propagate cosmological distances without significant energy loss , then interact with ebl relatively close to earth .",
    "the secondary @xmath0-rays production by interactions of cosmic rays emitted by distant blazars with photon background along the line of sight mainly depend on the pion decay .",
    "cosmic ray interactions with ebl should also produce neutrinos and electrons .",
    "we will concentrate on photons production and not discuss other particles in the proton - photon interaction processes .",

    "generally , the proton - proton ( @xmath89 ) interactions do not offer efficient @xmath0-rays production mechanisms in the jet .",
    "this mechanism could be effectively realized only in a scenario assuming that @xmath0-rays is produced in dense gas clouds that move across the jet ( e.g. morrison et al .",

    "on the other hand , at the conditions of existence of extremely high energy , @xmath93 , and in presence of large magnetic field , @xmath94 , the synchrotron radiation of the protons becomes a very effective channel of production of high energy @xmath0-rays . in our calculations , in order to reproduce the observed spectra of distant blazar 1es 1101 - 232 , we adopt a lower protons energy and magnetic field .",
    "these postulations lead to a longer ages of proton with @xmath95 ( aharonian 2000 ) , where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and fainter radiation in the jet .",
    "the proton induced cascade process ( mannheim 1993 ; 1996 ) is another attractive possibility for production of high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "this process relates the observed @xmath0-rays radiation to the development of pair cascades in the jet triggered by secondary photo - meson products produced at interactions of accelerated protons with low frequency synchrotron radiation in the source or ebl photons outside the source . for a low energy target photon field",
    ", the photo - meson cooling time of protons can be estimated using the approximate formula @xmath98 ( begelman et al .",

    "we simply approximate the broad synchrotron spectral component by a power - law function with the energy - flux index @xmath100 and denoting its luminosity by @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 ( e.g. sikora 2010 ) .",
    "thus , for the parameters of 1es 1101 - 232 , the photo - meson cooling time can not be significantly less than light travel timescales @xmath103 .",
    "we argue that the uncooled protons can escape from the emission region , and then interact with the background photons along the line of sight .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a model for a possible origin of hard very high energy spectra from a distant blazar .",
    "though , several models which could explain very hard intrinsic blazar spectra in the @xmath0-ray band have already been proposed ( katarzynski et al . 2006 ; b@xmath104ttcher et al . 2008 ; aharonian et al . 2008 ; lefa et al . 2011 ; yan et al . 2012 ) . in the model ,",
    "both the primary photons produced in the source and secondary photons produced outside the source contribute to the observed high energy @xmath0-rays emission .",
    "that is , the primary photons are produced in the source through the ssc process , and the secondary photons are produced outside the source through high energy protons interaction with the background photons along the line of sight . assuming a suitable electron and proton spectra , we obtain excellent fits to observed spectra of distant blazar 1es 1101 - 232 .",
    "this indicated that the surprisingly low attenuation of high energy @xmath0-rays , especially for the shape of the very high energy @xmath0-rays tail of the observed spectra , can be explained by secondary @xmath0-rays produced in interactions of cosmic - ray protons with background photons in the intergalactic space(essey & kusenko 2010 ; essey et al .",
    "2010 ; 2011 ) .",
    "the properties of the model mentioned above should have been testable in the multi - wavelength observations on tev blazar .",
    "costamante ( 2012 ) argue that in several cases we have already seen the superposition of two different emission components at high electron energies , with a new components emerging over a previous sed . since , in our case , the secondary @xmath0-rays are produced outside of the host galaxy , this expects to harder spectra in tev energy band than gev energy band .",
    "these should be verified in the future multi - wavelength observations .",
    "otherwise , the neutrino populations can be expected in @xmath105 interactions , we leave this possibility for next work and icecube observations .",

    "<S> this indicated that the surprisingly low attenuation of high energy @xmath0-rays , especially for the shape of the very high energy @xmath0-rays tail of the observed spectra , can be explained by secondary @xmath0-rays produced in interactions of cosmic - ray protons with background photons in the intergalactic space .    </S>",
