    "studies of the kuiper belt have progressed in the last two decades from finding individual objects @xcite to estimating the total number of objects in the outer solar system through observations and statistics ( e.g. this work ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kuiper belt itself has been subdivided into many distinct dynamical classes of objects , including objects in mean - motion resonances with neptune , high and low inclination populations ( hot vs. cold , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and various groupings of scattered objects that have undergone dynamical interactions with neptune .",
    "the relative numbers of objects in all of these populations offer one of the best direct observational constraints on different dynamical models of solar system formation and evolution .",
    "a recent renaissance in modeling has resulted in a number of mostly successful attempts to reproduce the architecture of the solar system .",
    "scattering and migration of the giant planets should leave directly observable signatures in the dynamical structure and numbers of small bodies remaining in the asteroid and kuiper belts and the outer satellites @xcite .",
    "some models , such as the nice model @xcite and the  grand tack \" @xcite , invoke large - scale , abrupt motion by the giant planets .",
    "other models assume that giant planet migration proceeded more smoothly , and predict different ratios of objects captured into mean - motion resonances with neptune @xcite .",
    "most models to date can successfully account for some  but not all  features of the kuiper belt , such as reproducing the cold but not the hot classical populations ( smooth migration ) , or leaving particular resonances over- or under - populated relative to the apparent populations ( most models ) .",
    "observational constraints can be used to distinguish between models and resolve fundamental questions , such as how neptune migrated outward : smoothly on a nearly circular orbit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , through dynamic scattering with potential high eccentricity which was later damped down ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or some other mechanism .",
    "this fundamental debate is evident in recent meetings , where one presentation concluded that chaotic capture models are more likely based on colors of resonant kuiper belt objects , or kbos @xcite , while another @xcite claimed that the large binary fraction in the cold population favors smooth migration , since the mechanism of @xcite to push out the cold population would not preserve as many binary objects .",
    "however , it is also possible to have models with elements of both : a nice - like initial migration that proceeds smoothly into a pre - existing cold population of objects that formed _ in situ _ would not be ruled out by the binary fraction @xcite .    until recently ,",
    "comparisons to observations have been disadvantaged because the known sample ( over 1600 objects ) is an inherently biased population , due to the difficulty of obtaining observations of faint , distant objects .",
    "what is needed is a de - biased population of objects , that is to say , a relatively large sample of objects discovered by a wide - field , all - sky survey that have had the sources of bias accounted for and removed .",
    "two surveys with large discovery samples have recently begun to provide such results .",
    "the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ) , with a sample of 169 objects with high - quality orbits , reported de - biased population estimates in @xcite and @xcite .    here",
    "we report the results of the deep ecliptic survey ( des ) @xcite , the largest single survey to date , which has discovered about 500 objects with provisional designations by the minor planet center ( mpc ) . of these objects ,",
    "304 have high - quality orbits suitable for dynamical classifications .",
    "the de - biased class populations presented in this paper offer a completely independent check on the cfeps results , on both the absolute and relative numbers of objects , since the des uses a different set of objects and discovery fields and a new approach to de - biasing .",
    "the des sample also more than doubles the number of de - biased objects available , particularly in the small - number classes of high - order resonances and scattered objects . finally , we hope that the approach described in this paper will be useful for obtaining uniformly de - biased results of the expected thousands or tens of thousands of objects found by future large - scale surveys , such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , * ? ? ? * ) and pan - starrs @xcite .    in section  [ section : data ]",
    "we describe the data and briefly review the choice of classification scheme . in section  [ section : math ] we present the analytical framework for calculating the detection probabilities",
    ". section  [ section : numerical ] contains the numerical implementation of the detection probabilities and the methods used to estimate the number of objects in each class . in section  [ section : others ] we compare our results to other surveys . in section  [ section : theory ] we relate our observations to theories of planetary formation .",
    "a full description of the des can be found in @xcite and @xcite ( henceforth e05 ) , but the relevant details are summarized here .",
    "the des was an noao ( national optical astronomical observatory ) survey .",
    "two 4-meter telescopes ( the mayall at kitt peak in arizona and the blanco at cerro tololo in chile ) were used , with identical mosaic cameras with 8 site ccd chips , each chip measuring 4096 by 2048 pixels .",
    "each mosaic image covers about 0.35 deg@xmath23 on the sky .",
    "each field was within @xmath24 of the ecliptic and was selected to have at least 35 usno - b astrometric reference stars on each chip .",
    "the fields were also chosen to exclude stars brighter than magnitude @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "typically two 300-sec exposures would be taken on the same night a few hours apart , with a third frame on another night during the same observing run .",
    "this resulted in orbital arcs of at least 24 hours ( required for a designation by the mpc ) .",
    "most of the fields imaged were distinct , but sometimes frames of the same field taken several years apart were counted as new search fields , since by that time a new set of objects would have moved into the field area . in 2005 ,",
    "the deep ecliptic survey stopped surveying new fields , although recovery efforts to improve orbits and classifications of known objects have continued .    in order to obtain as uniform a sample as possible , for this work several selection criteria",
    "were applied to both the search fields and the objects discovered by the des , as described below .",
    "the discovery phase of the des ended on 11 may 2005 .",
    "a few kbos were discovered during subsequent recovery efforts , but are not included in our sample since they were found under different search conditions .",
    "( for objects that were discovered during the main survey , we used the latest available orbital information to assign dynamical classes and calculate discovery probabilities . )    a total of 62,392 individual frames are in the des database , corresponding to one of the eight ccd detectors on the mosaic camera .",
    "of these , 14,440 were not suitable for de - biasing because these frames were specifically targeted at the recovery of particular objects .",
    "targeted recovery frames were not held to the same criteria for the number and brightness of stars , and have different statistical properties .",
    "an additional 1,312 frames with solar elongation angle less than @xmath26 were eliminated , because they have a different search efficiency than the bulk of the frames , which were taken near opposition .",
    "( over twice as many objects were found on high solar elongation frames than on low - elongation frames . )",
    "the 46,640 individual frames left were then paired up with matching frames .",
    "each field was observed at least three times : a pair of images taken on the same night a few hours apart , and one image on another night .",
    "sometimes additional frames were taken , for instance if weather interrupted the original observations .",
    "only the pair of frames on the same night was used to search for objects .",
    "there were 18,668 pairs of frames that met these criteria .",
    "the overlap fraction for each pair is quite high , with a median positional offset of 0.026 .",
    "each frame is 1065  by 532 , and the largest mis - registration was less than 80  in ra and less than 90  in declination .      as of 2012 august ,",
    "a total of 913 kbos were listed in the des internal database .",
    "some objects have been excluded from this analysis because they were found outside the main survey , during recovery or other follow - up observations ( 101 objects ) .",
    "we also exclude 8 objects found on low solar elongation fields ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "several additional objects , typically those that were lost shortly after discovery , are excluded because of missing information : objects lack discovery field coordinates ( 36 objects ) , discovery distances ( 104 objects ) , or discovery magnitudes ( 1 object ) .",
    "this leaves 663 objects discovered during the main des survey .    of these objects ,",
    "478 objects had sufficient observations post - discovery to receive preliminary designations from the minor planet center ( 72% ) .",
    "dynamical classification typically requires additional observations to achieve low enough errors , and 316 objects ( 48% ) have been classified ( see section  [ section : classification ] ) .",
    "almost all ( 304 ) of these classifications are considered to be secure ( quality 3 as defined in e05 ) . for our analyses",
    ", we used the 304 securely classified des objects .",
    "we note that there is a potential for recovery bias in the particular subset of objects that were both discovered and classified by the des .",
    "one could imagine that objects in unusual orbits could be missed more frequently than objects that were closer to their predicted location when follow up observations were taken a few months later .",
    "however , we do not think that this recovery bias introduces a major problem for the current work for the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the single biggest reason for failure to recover an object was insufficient telescope time to re - observe an object within 3 months of discovery , after which observations were typically not attempted ; this affected objects in all orbits alike .",
    "it was more likely that an object was lost because we did not have enough clear weather nights than because we looked in the wrong place and did not find it .",
    "( 2 ) when the estimated orbital parameters for the lost objects were compared to those that were ultimately designated and classified , @xcite found that the only main difference was that the lost objects were fainter ( and thus would be harder to recover on an average frame ) . in this work",
    "we find that the rate of recovery was twice as good for objects with @xmath28 than for fainter objects , and we only do analyses using the better - recovered subset of brighter objects .",
    "future work is planned to deal with the fainter objects , including the improved magnitude calibration , and we will also more fully explore the recovery bias at that time .",

    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the current des classification scheme , a modified version of the scheme laid out in e05 which incorporates the scattering concept from @xcite .",
    "since differences in the precise definitions of classes can affect the membership of objects and consequently the parameters derived for the class , we describe our classification scheme in full below .",
    "to test for the dynamical class of an object , we use both the current observed orbital parameters as well as a 10 myr integration of the orbit forward in time , and two additional 10 myr integrations for the @xmath29 values for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "an object is said to be securely classified ( quality 3 ) only if all three integrations agree on the same dynamical class .",
    "( in quality 2 objects , the nominal classification only agrees with one of the @xmath30 or @xmath31 integrations , while in quality 1 it agrees with neither . )",
    "an object is tested for membership in each of the following dynamical classes , in order .",
    "( 1 ) _ resonant _ objects occupy a mean - motion resonance with neptune ( resonances up to ninth order are identified from libration in the resonant angle ) .",
    "( 2 ) _ centaurs _ have osculating perhelia that reach values less than the osculating semimajor axis of neptune .",
    "( 3 ) _ scattered near _",
    "objects have @xmath3 values that vary by more than an arbitrary amount , @xmath32 , over the 10 myr integration ( where @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is along the same lines as the scattering class of @xcite , which uses @xmath34   au . an excitation statistic , @xmath35 , is applied to the remaining objects , which are sent to two additional classes : ( 4 ) _ scattered extended _ objects have @xmath36 , and ( 5 ) _ classical _ objects have @xmath37 . note that the exact criteria used can have an important impact on class membership : for instance , what might in other works be considered hot classical objects ( low @xmath4 , large @xmath5 ) with @xmath38 degrees would be classified as scattered extended under this scheme",
    ".    for the purposes of this paper , we have re - grouped a few objects in order to be more broadly consistent with the classes used by cfeps and elsewhere .",
    "first , we restrict the population of centaurs to only those with semi - major axes less than neptune s ( resulting in a population of smaller objects than found in any other class , due to the magnitude bias toward finding closer objects ) .",
    "second , we group all of the dynamically excited objects with @xmath39  au into a single _ scattered _ class , which contains objects from the centaur , scattered - near , and scattered - extended classes .",
    "ten objects with @xmath40  au are not considered in this analysis , because they are too sparse in parameter space to adequately define a dynamical class ; for a brief discussion of such rare objects see section  [ section : rare ] .",
    "we now consider how we can use the sample of kbos discovered by the des to learn about the entire population of kbos .",
    "dynamical classes for kbos have been defined with the underlying assumption that the members of each class have experienced a common formation process and common dynamical evolution .",
    "hence , we shall consider the objects in each dynamical class separately . within a dynamical class ,",
    "we assume that the des discoveries give us a sampling of the greater population of the objects , which can be characterized by four distribution functions : one each for the @xmath6-magnitude , semimajor axis @xmath3 , eccentricity @xmath4 , and inclination @xmath5 .    in section  [ ss : prob ]",
    ", we develop the equations to compute the probability of detection by the des for each object , as a function of @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in section",
    "[ ss : distfunc ] , we present the distribution functions that we assume are followed by the general population of the dynamical class for the same four parameters . finally , in section  [ ss : maxlike ] we develop a maximum likelihood model to fit the data . from this fit , we determine , with error bars , the parameters of the four distribution functions and the number of objects in each dynamical class , within the range of orbital parameters probed by the des discoveries . we have chosen to apply the maximum - likelihood technique directly , rather than applying least - squares fitting to binned data , since the objects per bin are sparse in the four - dimensional @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5-space ( see chapter 10 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      to compute the probability that an object would have been detected by the des at some time during the survey , we extend the methods described in e05 to include observational biases introduced by an object s @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 values .",
    "we refer all inclinations to the kuiper belt plane ( kbp ) , as derived in e05 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , which is consistent with the invariable plane of the solar system at the 1-@xmath43 level .",
    "following the approach used in e05 , we consider a set of @xmath44 objects ( @xmath45 ) discovered in a set of @xmath46 search fields ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "for the @xmath48th object discovered by the survey , we denote its @xmath6-magnitude , semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination by the symbols @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath6 magnitude of an object is not correlated with its orbital elements , and that angles that describe the orientation of the orbit in 3-dimensional space average out over time .",
    "( for resonant objects , this assumption is not quite true , and is addressed in a separate bias factor discussed below . )",
    "each of the @xmath46 fields of the survey data set is characterized by ( i ) the magnitude for which the detection efficiency has dropped to 1/2 , which we denote by @xmath53 , ( ii ) the kuiper belt latitude and orientation , or tilt , of the frame ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , used to calculate which orbits pass through a field , ( iii ) the kuiper belt longitude of the frame ( @xmath56 ) , and ( iiv ) the solid angle , @xmath57 , subtended by the search field . below we describe how biases related to all four of these characteristics have been removed .",
    "\\(i ) we assume that all search fields have the same maximum efficiency at bright magnitudes , @xmath58 , and the same characteristic range , @xmath59 , over which the detection efficiency drops from @xmath58 to 0 ; as in e05 , we have fixed the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for the @xmath62th search field",

    "hence the likelihood , @xmath69 , for the @xmath48th object being discovered in the @xmath62th search field due solely to its magnitude ( we shall consider other factors later ) is given by    @xmath70    our strategy for evaluating the integral in equation  [ eqn2 ] involves transforming it from an integral over magnitude to an integral over heliocentric distance . to do this",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first we assume that all objects are discovered at opposition , and we set the earth - sun distance to 1 au when computing the variation in the opposition magnitude of an object throughout its orbit .",
    "we define @xmath71 as the heliocentric discovery distance for the @xmath48th object and @xmath72 as its discovery magnitude .",
    "we neglect photometric variability due to changing phase angle and/or rotational light curve , since the mean amplitude of variability is only 0.1 mag , with only 15% of all kbos varying by more than 0.15 mag @xcite",
    ". then the magnitude of the @xmath48th object at a heliocentric distance @xmath73 is given by the equation ,    @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{eqn3}\\ ] ]    for the @xmath48th object , the minimum and maximum heliocentric distances are @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively :    @xmath77    @xmath78    to find the amount of time that the @xmath48th object spends at a given heliocentric distance , @xmath73 , it is possible to directly numerically integrate a two - body orbit and then calculate the amount of time spent in each distance bin . however , this approach is far too slow for an equation that is called frequently , and there are no good analytical approximations that work near perihelion and aphelion , where then probability of finding an object peaks sharply .",
    "we thus calculated a grid of numerical integrations using @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . for each eccentricity , we fit a piecewise function composed of five line segments ( @xmath82 to @xmath83 ) at predefined break points ( @xmath84 to @xmath85 ) .",
    "the coordinates for the slopes and offsets and break - points of each line are stored for each eccentricity in a python executable file , and may be quickly called during numeric integrations .",
    "the function , which has been normalized over the allowed @xmath73 range , is scaled to the appropriate @xmath3 value when called .",
    "tests indicate that the results are within @xmath86 of the values obtained using numeric integration ( for objects with @xmath87  au , which is the cutoff in this paper for the scattered class ) .",
    "@xmath88    we are now in a position to rewrite equation  [ eqn2 ] in terms of an integral over heliocentric distance . since our approximations reduce the apparent magnitude of an object with a given @xmath6 magnitude to only the variation that depends on its semi - major axis and eccentricity , we emphasize this by using the symbol @xmath89 for the likelihood factor instead of @xmath90 used in e05 ( see the glossary in their appendix c ) .",
    "substituting @xmath91 for @xmath92 in the integral and changing the limits of integration from magnitudes to the corresponding heliocentric distances , we find    @xmath93    equation  [ eqn7 ] can be evaluated with substitutions from equations  [ eqn1 ] ,  [ eqn3 ] , and  [ eqn6 ] , using equations [ eqn4 ] and [ eqn5 ] to set the limits of integration .",
    "\\(ii ) we now consider the bias factor for inclination , @xmath94 , using the same approach as in the inclination distribution analysis of @xcite , hereafter g10 .",
    "first we write an expression for the conditional probability of finding an object at latitude @xmath95 with an inclination @xmath5 , which is equation ( 9 ) of g10 :    @xmath96    ( note that in g10 and this work all inclinations and latitudes are relative to the kbp . )",
    "we define @xmath94 as the likelihood ( based on the inclination alone ) of detecting the @xmath48th object in the @xmath62th search field , which we determine by integrating the conditional probability for the inclination , @xmath52 , over the range of kbp coordinates covered by the @xmath62th search field :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the range of longitudes at each latitude on the frame ( a geometric parameter derived in g10 , their equations 11 - 14 ) , and @xmath55 is the tilt of the frame with respect to the kbp .",
    "\\(iii ) resonant objects , by definition , oscillate around the resonant angle with a certain amplitude .",
    "observationally , this has the effect that they are observed preferentially at some longitude relative to neptune but not at others . using the libration amplitudes found in a 10 myr integration of the orbit of each object",
    ", we can determine a _ longitude bias _",
    ", where the fields in the allowed longitude range , @xmath99 , are upweighted and all other longitudes are set to zero ( note that for non - resonant objets @xmath100 ) :    @xmath101    \\(iv ) a minor correction is included for the solid angle of each set of fields that is available for object searches .",
    "the effective search area for a pair of frames varies slightly due to mis - registration ( typically a few arcseconds ) and obscuration by other objects on the field .",
    "defining @xmath102 as the solid angle of a full ccd and @xmath57 as the net solid angle for the kth ccd , the solid angle component of the likelihood factor ( following e05 ) is    @xmath103    neglecting any correlation among @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , the combined likelihood , @xmath104 , for detecting the @xmath48th object in the @xmath62th search field is the product of the four separate likelihood components in equations  [ eqn7 ] ,  [ eqn9 ] ,  [ eqn10 ] , and  [ eqn11 ] :    @xmath105    if we had observed all the search fields simultaneously , then the probability for having detected the @xmath48th object for the @xmath46 search fields would be equal to the sum of the probabilities for each search field .",
    "this would be the case for a single night , or even a single lunation .",
    "however , we observe the search fields over a period of years , with the possibility of an object moving between search fields , so instead we take the efficiency of detecting the objects to be 1 minus the product of the likelihoods of having not detected it in each search field .",
    "we refer to this quantity as the detection probability of the survey for the @xmath48th object , @xmath106 :    @xmath107    from the probability of detecting each individual object and other assumptions , we can characterize the distribution of unbiased orbital parameters and estimate the numbers of objects in each of the dynamical classes , as described in the next section .      for each class of objects , we want to determine the distribution functions for the parameters defining the class ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) . here",

    ". thus the form of the @xmath6 distribution is modeled using :    @xmath113    where    @xmath114",

    "the 5:2 abundances , on the other hand , are approximately the same in both surveys ( 7 times as many classicals as 5:2s ) . since resonance ratios are used to distinguish between planet formation scenarios , future work is need to resolve these discrepancies .",
    "there are many ways of subdividing populations of kbos , and one long - standing division has been to divide the classical belt between  hot \" and  cold \" objects , based on the orbital inclinations .",
    "we have noted before that the precise choice of class definition strongly impacts the values derived : for instance , several of the highest - inclination classical objects in previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been classified here as scattered objects , removing the need for a double gaussian ( or  hot classical \" population ) inclination distribution .",
    "it is useful therefore to make comparisons wherever possible using the same classification scheme .",

    "we examined the des sample using the same criteria ( plus our restrictions to objects with @xmath373 and @xmath374  au ) and found that the best - fit slopes ( @xmath288 ) were @xmath375 and @xmath376 . despite using completely different objects and de - biasing methods , these numbers are very similar to fraser s values : @xmath377 with a break at @xmath378 , and @xmath379 with a break at @xmath380 @xcite . the value after the break point for fraser s cold population (",

    "as neptune migrated outward during the early history of the solar system , it sculpted the primordial population of objects in the disk around and beyond its orbit , including pushing captured objects out into mean - motion resonances . in principle",
    ", we can use the relative number of objects in different dynamical classes to distinguish between models for how neptune migrated , because objects in different orbits are captured with varying efficiency . using the de - biased detection results of the previous sections , the des finds , for instance , that there are about 0.7 times as many 2:1 objects as 3:2 objects ( out to the break in the size distribution at @xmath190 ) , and 1.3 times as many scattered as classical objects .",
    "we now examine recent models of planet formation and see how they compare to the des class populations .",
    "the existence of objects in mean - motion resonances is evidence that neptune migrated outward from where it formed @xcite .",
    "many early numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) made the assumption that this outward migration happened more or less smoothly , with the giant planets maintaining generally low eccentricity , and that the population of objects that neptune migrated through was dynamically `` cold '' ( low @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , when such models attempted to reproduce the observed structure of the kuiper belt , they had difficulties explaining the observed eccentricity and inclination distributions .",
    "for instance , a pre - existing dynamically `` hot '' ( @xmath397 ) disk allows for more efficient resonance capture into higher - order resonances , and @xcite found that objects would be expected in many `` exotic '' resonances that the des has in fact found objects in , including the 5:2 , 9:4 , 7:3 , 11:6 , 12:5 , 3:1 , 7:2 , and 4:1 ( table  [ table : det ] ) .",
    "however , even with an initially excited disk , problems remain with smooth migration models .",
    "if the resonances were swept out of a hot classical disk , the inclination distribution of the 3:2 resonance should resemble that of the classical population it formed from , and this is not the case ( compare figures  [ fig : mlclassical ] and [ fig : ml3to2 ] ) .",
    "instead , the 3:2 inclination distribution is much closer to the scattered inclination distribution ( figure  [ fig : mlscattered ] ) , indicating a different formation model ( see section  [ section : chaos ] ) .",
    "the smooth model is similarly argued against by the similarity in colors of the 3:2 and scattered , but not classical , populations @xcite .    comparing absolute numbers of objects , we find that the smooth migration model of @xcite overestimates the number of classical objects by a factor of 7 ( 130,000 predicted @xmath398 , compared to the des estimate of 19,000 ) , and finds the opposite ratios of 3:2 and 2:1 objects ( twice as many 2:1 , whereas we find 0.7 times as many ) and classical to scattered ( five times as many classical , whereas we find 30% more scattered ) .",
    "other problems noted with smooth migration include the inability to explain objects with @xmath399 degrees or to populate the extended scattered disk ( perihelia beyond 40 au ) , where objects such as sedna and several des objects have been found .",
    "for all of these reasons , smooth migration can not fully explain the evolution of the outer solar system .",
    "current evidence suggests that the early history of the solar system was much more chaotic than previously thought , as proposed and later refined in a series of papers collectively referred to as the `` nice model '' @xcite . in its current incarnation @xcite",
    ", the model posits that a number of giant planets ( up six ) were originally configured so that jupiter and saturn were near a major resonance , likely a mutual 3:2 resonance , and dramatic changes in planetary orbits ensued when the resonance was crossed . in simulations with more than four giants ,",
    "one or two planets similar to uranus or neptune were ejected from the early solar system ; a major resonance crossing has also been invoked to explain the late heavy bombardment of inner solar system .",
    "all of these events left a dramatic mark on the kuiper belt .",
    "in general , the nice model has been much more successful than previous attempts at explaining kuiper belt structure .",
    "regardless of precisely how objects are partitioned between classical and scattered designations , there exists a bi - modal inclination distribution @xcite which the nice model can reproduce . additionally , the nice model predicted that some of the primordial population of objects was captured to make up jupiter s trojan population at the same time as the giant planets were sculpting the resonant and scattered populations of the kuiper belt @xcite , although observations at the time seemed to contradict the prediction that such objects would have similar slopes",
    ". a recent reanalysis of the trojan size distribution by @xcite has found that , in fact , the trojan population has a similar two - slope fit to that work s results for the hot population ( @xmath400 , @xmath401 , and @xmath402 ) , which are also in agreement with this work ( except for some difference in the break point , which is likely due in part to @xmath6 magnitude conversions and differing average albedoes ) .",
    "nonetheless , some important details still need to be worked out .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the observed 3:2 distribution had higher eccentricities than the simulations could produce ; as seen in figure  [ fig : ml3to2 ] , the debiased eccentricity distribution is even more highly eccentric .",
    "the simulations also produced a classical distribution that was too eccentric , although it has been noted by @xcite that this may be less due to a failure of the model and more to the assumption that the space neptune was pushing objects out into was previously unpopulated .",
    "@xcite finds that a separate , primordial cold population is also supported by the high wide binary fraction , which is too large for the mechanism of @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature is that cold classical objects ( defined by inclination ) are less eccentric than the stability limit requires @xcite .",
    "for the least - excited ( @xmath403 ) objects , there is a  wedge \" in @xmath404 space where no objects exist despite orbits being stable in that regime .",
    "@xcite identified the area as just inside the 7:4 mean motion resonance .",
    "the wedge has been argued to support either a primordial cold belt of objects @xcite , or to be a natural result of resonance interactions during smooth migration at the tail end of neptune s outward journey @xcite .",
    "clear evidence of this wedge is seen in the des classical objects in the same region ( between the 5:3 and 7:4 mean motion resonances ) , where there are 43 objects .",
    "we can do cdf and ml fits as above , and find that the cdf slope of the population just inside the 7:4 resonance ( @xmath405 ) agrees with the full cold population , with @xmath406 , which is not surprising given the ml fit to the inclinations ( @xmath407 , @xmath408 ) , while the eccentricities are indeed well below the stability limit of @xmath409 ( @xmath410 , @xmath411 ) .",
    "( we note that we find 10 - 15% as many 7:4 as classical objects in this region , or about half what the non - debiased results and model simulations of @xcite both found ; the difference is probably due to the slightly further distance , which adds 0.2 magnitudes , as well as to the higher inclinations and eccentricities of 7:4 objects , all of which slightly bias against discovery even of this relatively close class . )",
    "as more detailed model predictions of fine regions of phase space are made , it will become increasingly necessary that ( a ) all parties involved are using the same dynamical definitions , and ( b ) that observers make debiased data available and that modelers compare to debiased data wherever possible .",
    "-magnitude distribution of centaurs , which are well fit by a single power law with @xmath412 ( dashed line ) .",
    "no evidence is found for the divot reported by @xcite , based on 11 cfeps scattered objects ( solid line ) .",
    "( note that the divot model has been scaled down by a factor of 20 from the absolute scale reported in @xcite , to match the values plotted in @xcite . ) ]    there has long been evidence that the size distribution of kuiper belt objects can not follow a single power law .",
    "a break in the size distribution power law has been proposed for objects smaller than about 100 km diameter @xcite , although the exact location varies by model .",
    "destructive collisions have been evoked to explain the existence of a break at roughly the same size ( e.g. , 40 km * ? ? ?",
    "the exactly location of the size break , however , has not yet been observed because of the faint magnitudes of objects in this size regime : 100 km with an albedo of 0.05 roughly corresponds to @xmath413 .",
    "collisional evolution modeling by @xcite presented theoretical support for a depletion region from @xmath414 km , with reduced collision rates for larger objects ( @xmath415 km ) , allowing the steep power law from the brighter kuiper belt to continue until that point .",
    "a `` divot '' is expected in the power law at around that point .",
    "recently , there has been a claimed detection of that `` divot '' around @xmath413 @xcite , based on 11 scattering objects discovered and de - biased by cfeps using their survey simulator .",
    "these objects range in brightness from @xmath416 , with only two objects ( l4k09 and l4v11 ) fainter than the supposed `` divot '' point ( @xmath417 and @xmath418 , respectively ) .",
    "the lack of additional objects is itself used as a constraint on the steepness of the slope .",
    "collisional grinding has come under fire recently , however , since it would have disrupted the many wide binaries found in the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "@xcite has compiled detections up to @xmath413 and finds a much shallower turn - over at @xmath419 , in line with what we have found in this independent work .",
    "after accounting for the albedo distribution , that paper concluded that the turn - over diameter is at @xmath420  km .",
    "the picture that has emerged is of a cold population ( roughly the des classical group ) that formed in situ around 40 au , while the hot objects ( des scattered plus resonances ) formed around 15 - 35 au and were scattered outward .",
    "the cold belt can not have endured order - of - magnitude collisional evolution , and must have always had a surface density similar to the current density , while that of the hot objects must be @xmath421 times greater .",
    "these five orders of magnitudes imply a growth time rate that is @xmath421 times slower in the outer solar system , and this creates intractable problems for object formation time scales and the development of a broken size distribution @xcite .",
    "another theoretical explanation for the existence of a break is required .",
    "locating the break observationally also is challenging .",
    "most observations do not have numerous objects on both sides , although meta - analyses such as @xcite do a good job of pulling together disparate observations .",
    "the only des class with objects fainter than about @xmath422 is the centaurs , which approach closer than neptune and are consequently often much brighter at discovery .",
    "although centaurs are now located inside the inner edge of the kuiper belt , they are thought to be the transitional stage between the scattered disk and jupiter family comets ( jfcs ) .",
    "this is supported by both dynamical evolution calculations @xcite and the similarity of the centaur inclination distribution @xcite to both the scattered objects and jfcs ( and not to the main kuiper belt or resonant objects ) .",
    "the slope observed for the centaur objects , @xmath291 , is consistent with other populations of small objects reported in the literature , such as the jupiter family comets ( @xmath423 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is also the same power law as the the faint end of the jupiter trojans as measured by @xcite ( @xmath424 ) and @xcite ( @xmath401 ) . with 7 des objects between @xmath425 and @xmath426",
    ", we see no sign of the purported `` divot '' of @xcite , which most of our objects are fainter than ( figure  [ fig : divot ] ) .",
    "no sign of turnover is seen out to @xmath427 ( @xmath428  km assuming albedo=0.05 ) .",
    "the kuiper belt contains a record of outer solar system history , and de - biased observations of different classes of objects are a powerful tool to understanding it .",
    "the des is the largest uniform survey to weigh in on the dynamical statistics .",
    "here we have presented an analysis of a dataset of 304 objects , as well as a new method for accounting for discovery biases .",
    "we have calculated the detection probability for 304 objects with secure orbital classifications , accounting for biases related to the object semi - major axis , eccentricity , inclination , discovery magnitude , discovery distance , and absolute magnitude .",
    "using these probabilities , we can estimate the size distribution for 246 objects in 8 classes with at least 5 objects each , using @xmath6-magnitude as an observable proxy for object diameter .",
    "a double power - law is required to explain the data , with the population of classical objects used to derive the main power law slope , @xmath182 , and the intrinsically fainter centaur population is used to derive the slope after the break point , @xmath184 .",
    "this power law is consistent with all eight classes that have sufficient objects .",
    "the parameters of this power law are @xmath429 for @xmath430 and @xmath291 for fainter objects .",
    "we note that this power law also appears to break down at the very brightest , and largest , objects ( @xmath287 ) , as is seen in the 3:2 distribution",
    ". this may be due to small number statistics in the objects detected , the stochastic nature of a few large - body collisions , or a change in the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of large objects .",
    "we can also estimate the total number of objects in the kuiper belt up to a particular size .",
    "two different methods were used , a max - likelihood estimation that determined distribution functions for four quantities ( @xmath431 ) and a cdf based directly on inverted probabilities that only determined the @xmath6 magnitude distribution .",
    "for comparison between classes , we prefer the cdf results , which were possible on 8 classes ( there were too few objects to use the max - likelihood approach for the other classes ) .",
    "we note that the ratios between the classes are similar in the max - likelihood analysis , although the overall abundances of objects are 1.5 - 2 times larger .",
    "we adopt the cdf results , and find that for @xmath432 the number of objects in 8 classes : classical ( @xmath13 objects ) , scattered ( @xmath14 ) , 3:2 ( @xmath15 ) , 2:1 ( @xmath16 ) , 5:2 ( @xmath17 ) , 7:4 ( @xmath18 ) , 5:3 ( @xmath19 ) , and centaurs ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "finally , we can compare our data to other reported observations and model predictions .",
    "the absolute number and power law slope agree with results presented by the other major kuiper belt survey , cfeps , for the classical objects .",
    "some additional classes of objects ( such as the 5:3 and 7:4 resonances ) also agree .",
    "others , notably the 3:2 resonance , differ in absolute numbers by a factor of 4 .",
    "we also find no evidence for the divot reported in the scattered population by @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies in the details illustrate the value of having two completely independent data sets and analyses methods to determine the number of objects in the kuiper belt .    dividing our sample according to the  hot \" and  cold \" criteria of @xcite",
    ", we find excellent agreement in the reported breaks and slopes .",
    "the evidence of that work and this strongly points toward a brighter turn - over , around @xmath433 , than previously theorized .",
    "we would also like to reiterate the importance of comparing like to like , both in terms of dynamical class definitions and in terms of comparing observations to model results .    in anticipation of large all - sky surveys such as lsst and pan - starrs , we are making this de - biasing code available so that the discovery probabilities of objects found by any survey with the same characterizations can be calculated .",
    "we anticipate this will be a useful complement to tools such as the cfeps survey simulator for determining the structure of the kuiper belt .",
