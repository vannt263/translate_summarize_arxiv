    "recent years have been marked by a considerable progress in understanding of multiple scattering of light in random media in the so - called mesoscopic regime , when the coherence length @xmath0 of the incident light exceeds both the size of the disordered sample @xmath1 and the absorption length @xmath2 , and @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mean free path @xcite . in the mesoscopic regime ,",
    "interference of multiply scattered waves gives rise to a complicated and seemingly random spatial distribution of light intensity called ` speckle pattern ' or just ` speckle ' for brevity .",
    "speckles exhibit a number of interesting properties , such as short- @xcite and long - range @xcite correlations ( and related memory effect @xcite and ` universal conductance fluctuations ' @xcite ) , and enhanced sensitivity to small displacements of scatterers @xcite . as a practical matter , multiply scattered light finds applications in optical characterization of turbid materials ( e.g. , diffusing - wave spectroscopy @xcite and optical microrheology @xcite ) , medical diagnostics @xcite , design of random laser sources @xcite , and cryptography @xcite .",
    "most of the available work on multiple light scattering and speckles has concentrated on _ linear _ random media , where the polarization of the medium depends linearly on the electric field of the light wave .",
    "this regime is most often realized in practice since optical nonlinearities are known to be ( generally ) weak @xcite . at the same time",
    ", nonlinear optical systems are known to exhibit much more complex and reach behavior than their linear counterparts @xcite , and it would be therefore important for both fundamental research and applications to advance our understanding of optical phenomena in _ nonlinear _ random media . up to now , the interplay of randomness and nonlinearity has been studied mainly in one - dimensional systems , where numerical methods proved to be rather efficient ( see , e.g. , refs . and",
    "for representative bibliography ) . because waves are known to behave quite differently in systems of different dimensionalities , one - dimensional results are not readily generalizable to the three - dimensional case . in three - dimensional nonlinear random media",
    ", certain attention has been paid to the behavior of _ average _ transmission characteristics in the contexts of the so - called self - transparency effect @xcite and optical power limitation @xcite , whereas available studies of _ fluctuations _ of multiply scattered waves are rather limited @xcite .",
    "recently , a new phenomenon  dynamic instability of speckle patterns in random media with intensity - dependent refractive index ( kerr nonlinearity )  has been theoretically predicted @xcite",
    ". theoretical study of speckle dynamics beyond the instability threshold has been initiated in ref .   using a newly developed dynamic langevin approach .",
    "it has been found that speckle pattern is likely to exhibit a transition from a stationary state to the chaotic dynamics upon increasing the strength of nonlinearity .",
    "the analysis of ref .   suffers , however , from numerous limitations , making it hardly applicable to real experimental situations .",
    "namely , the nonlinearity is assumed to be instantaneous ( nonlinearity response time @xmath5 ) , only the limit of very large sample size ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the wavelength of light ) is treated , and the typical time scale @xmath9 of speckle dynamics beyond the instability threshold is assumed to be quite large : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the speed of light in the average medium .",
    "meanwhile , noninstantaneous nature of nonlinearity is known to play an important role in nonlinear dynamics of optical systems @xcite , the condition @xmath6 may be difficult to fulfill in practice , and imposing severe conditions on @xmath9 in the beginning of analysis is undesirable since @xmath9 is one of the quantities to be found as a result .    in the present paper , we apply the dynamic langevin approach introduced in ref .   to perform a detailed study of the onset of speckle pattern instability and speckle dynamics beyond the instability threshold , relaxing the above limitations @xcite .",
    "we show that the instability threshold is actually lower than found in ref .  , coinciding with the result obtained in refs .   and in a completely different way .",
    "dynamics of speckle pattern beyond the instability threshold appears to be very sensitive to relations between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the time required for multiply scattered light to propagate through a random sample of size @xmath1 , and @xmath17 is the photon diffusion constant .",
    "although we expect the speckle dynamics to be chaotic beyond the threshold independent of particular values of above parameters , the spectral content of this dynamics and , in particular , the maximal excited frequency and lyapunov exponents , are found to be sensitive to the ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we comment on the accuracy of our theory by identifying physical processes neglected in the calculation and discuss the conditions of possible experimental observation of the instability phenomenon for light in nonlinear random media .",
    "we consider multiple scattering of monochromatic ( frequency @xmath20 ) light in a non - absorbing sample of random medium ( typical size @xmath1 ) with weak disorder ( @xmath21 ) and intensity - dependent dielectric constant . for simplicity , and taking into account that multiple scattering depolarizes the light , we apply scalar approximation from the beginning .",
    "the problem then reduces to the following scalar nonlinear wave equation : @xmath22 \\right\\ } e({{\\mathbf r } } , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{4 cm } = j({{\\mathbf r } } , t ) , \\label{weq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the wave amplitude , @xmath24 is a monochromatic source term , @xmath25 is the fluctuating part of the linear dielectric constant normalized by its average value @xmath26 , and the nonlinear part of the dielectric constant @xmath27 ( normalized by @xmath26 as well ) depends on the intensity @xmath28 of the wave . for @xmath25",
    "we adopt the gaussian white - noise model : @xmath29 .",
    "it will be clear from the following that the specific model used for @xmath25 should not affect the main results of the paper significantly because they originate from the long - range diffusion of light in the random sample and not from the short - range properties of dielectric constant fluctuations .    if the random medium were linear [ @xmath30 , the time - dependence of @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) would be harmonic [ inasmuch as the source term @xmath32 is harmonic ] : @xmath33 , and hence @xmath34 would be independent of @xmath35 . due to nonlinearity ,",
    "however , the optical system under study can exhibit instabilities resulting in spontaneous ( periodic or chaotic ) dynamics of @xmath36 , despite the fact that the incident radiation [ @xmath37 , nonlinear sample [ @xmath25 ] , and conditions of light propagation remain unchanged ( i.e. , are time - independent ) .",
    "instability phenomena are widely encountered in nonlinear optics @xcite . allowing for spontaneous dynamics in our random optical system ( but in no way imposing its existence _ a priori _ ) , we keep the time dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath39 in what follows , assuming , however , that this dependence is relatively slow , i.e. that neither @xmath36 nor @xmath39 do not change significantly on the time scale of the mean free time @xmath40 .",
    "it will be seen from the following that spontaneous wave dynamics in nonlinear random media is indeed possible for a sufficiently strong nonlinearity and that a regime exists when the characteristic time scale of this dynamics is much larger than @xmath40 .",
    "due to the randomness of @xmath25 , @xmath23 and @xmath41 are random functions of @xmath42 as well ( speckle pattern )",
    ". we will be therefore interested in their statistical moments rather than in their specific @xmath42- and @xmath35-dependences for some particular realization of @xmath25 , an approach common in statistical optics @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the correlation function of intensity fluctuations @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , angular brackets denote averaging over realizations of disorder @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the average intensity that we assume time - independent . in linear media , spatial variations of @xmath46",
    "are known to be smooth ; @xmath46 changes significantly on the scale of the sample size @xmath1 but not on the scale of the mean free path @xmath4 . in the following we assume that this smoothness of @xmath46 is preserved in a nonlinear medium . to further simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume that the nonlinearity is weak enough to cause no significant modification of the mean free path @xmath4 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this requires @xmath47 .",
    "on the one hand , if this condition is violated , our analysis still remains at least qualitatively valid , provided that the mean free path @xmath4 is recalculated with account for nonlinearity of the medium . on the other hand ,",
    "the condition @xmath47 does not really limit the validity of our main results because , as will be seen from the following , instability of speckle pattern is expected to develop for much weaker nonlinearities than those required to violate the above condition .",
    "it is known that in a linear medium , correlation function of intensity fluctuations @xmath43 comprises short- and long - range contributions . the short - range ( in space )",

    "( [ p ] ) for @xmath255 .",
    "the path - integral picture of speckle pattern instability can help to understand how to apply the theoretical model developed in this paper to realistic experimental situations , when the disordered sample is characterized by three different size parameters @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 ( in the so - called ` slab ' geometry , for example , @xmath267 ) . in this case",
    ", the only size parameter @xmath1 of our theoretical model should be understood as a size of the part of disordered sample explored by a typical diffuse path ( and hence @xmath268 in the slab geometry ) .",
    "theoretical analysis performed in the present paper indicates that the multiple - scattering speckle pattern in a nonlinear random medium with intensity - dependent dielectric constant becomes unstable with respect to weak dynamic perturbations if the nonlinearity exceeds the threshold @xmath269 .",
    "this absolute instability threshold appears to be independent of the nonlinearity response time @xmath14 , whereas the frequency dependence of the threshold ( and , in particular , the spectrum of frequencies subject to instability ) is very sensitive to @xmath14 .",
    "it is pertinent to note the extensive nature of the bifurcation parameter @xmath156 . according to eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) , weak nonlinearity can be efficiently compensated by a sufficiently large sample size @xmath1 and @xmath270 can be reached even at vanishing @xmath271 , provided that @xmath1 is large enough .",
    "another remarkable feature of eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) is the independence of @xmath156 of the sign of @xmath271 .",
    "the phenomenon of speckle pattern instability is therefore expected to develop in a similar way for both positive and negative nonlinear coefficients @xmath118 .",
    "this is not common for instabilities in nonlinear optical systems without disorder @xcite since the latter instabilities are often related to the self - focusing effect , arising at @xmath272 only .",
    "the instability discussed in the present paper is of different type and has nothing to do with self - focusing ( which is negligible for @xmath273 assumed throughout the paper ) .",
    "this does not mean , however , that phenomena similar to those discussed in the present paper do not exist in homogeneous nonlinear media .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ phasenl ] ) describes nothing but the self - phase modulation @xcite of the multiple - scattering speckle pattern .",
    "the development of self - phase modulation in a random medium , however , appears to be rather different from that in the homogeneous case .",
    "indeed , in a homogeneous medium of size @xmath1 the nonlinear phase shift is deterministic and @xmath274 for a wave of intensity @xmath275 , whereas in the case of diffuse multiple scattering @xmath276 is random with the average value @xmath277 and variance @xmath278 .",
    "the threshold of the speckle pattern instability @xmath269 can be therefore viewed as simply the point where the sample - to - sample fluctuations of the nonlinear phase shift become of order unity .",
    "it is worth while to comment on the connection of the problem considered in the present paper to the recent results on modulational instability ( mi ) of incoherent light beams in homogeneous nonlinear media @xcite . in this case , a 2d speckle pattern ( speckled beam ) with a controlled degree of spatial and temporal coherence is ` prepared ' by sending a coherent laser beam on a rotating diffuser .",
    "the beam is then incident on a homogeneous nonlinear medium ( inorganic photorefractive crystal ) .",
    "pattern formation and ` optical turbulence ' are observed if the intensity of the beam exceeds a specific threshold , determined by the degree of coherence of the beam .",
    "although the study presented in this paper is also concerned with the instability of speckle patterns in nonlinear media , it differs essentially from that of refs .   and",
    "at least in the following important aspects : ( a ) light loses its spatial coherence _ inside _ the medium , due to the multiple scattering on heterogeneities of refractive index , ( b ) the temporal coherence of incident light is perfect ( in the case of incoherent mi @xcite , coherence time of the incident beam is much shorter than the nonlinearity response time @xmath14 ) , and ( c ) the incident light beam is completely destroyed by scattering after a distance @xmath279 and light propagation is diffusive in the bulk of the sample .",
    "let us now say a few words about practical consequences of our results and conditions of possible experimental observation of the instability phenomenon for light in random media . in a real experiment , infinitely weak dynamic perturbations of stationary speckle pattern are always present ( due to , e.g. , various types of noise ) .",
    "our analysis predicts that the spectral components of these perturbations falling within the instability band @xmath165 will be amplified due to the nonlinearity of the medium .",
    "because our analysis is based on a linearized equation ( [ djnl ] ) , we can not predict further development of speckle dynamics with certainty , but our results suggest the following scenario .",
    "in general , there are two possibilities for the spontaneous dynamics of speckle pattern beyond the threshold .",
    "first , it can be ( quasi- ) periodic , i.e. dominated by oscillations at some discrete frequency ( or frequencies ) @xmath280 .",
    "second , it can be chaotic with a continuous spectrum of intensity fluctuations between some @xmath281 and @xmath232 . in nonlinear systems where dynamics is periodic , the frequency of oscillations @xmath280",
    "is often favored already on the level of the linear stability analysis : it is often the frequency for which the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath126 is reached . in our case ,",
    "@xmath126 exhibits monotonic decrease with @xmath136 ( see figs .  [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] ) , favoring no particular frequency .",
    "we have therefore no reason to expect the first scenario and the speckle pattern @xmath41 is likely to exhibit chaotic dynamics immediately beyond the instability threshold . the spectrum of chaotic fluctuations of @xmath41 will be continuous and comprised between @xmath282 and @xmath232 that we have discussed above .",
    "we note , however , that our analysis assumes diffusion regime of wave propagation ( @xmath21 and @xmath200 ) and is likely to fail if the scattering is low - order ( @xmath283 ) or if the regime of anderson localization is approached ( @xmath284 ) . in the latter cases ,",
    "the first scenario of instability development can be a plausible option .",
    "finally , experimental observation of instability of multiple - scattering speckle pattern will require , first of all , large enough sample size @xmath1 and as low absorption as possible ( if the macroscopic absorption length @xmath285 , the effective size of the sample will be limited to @xmath2 and one will not fully exploit the extensivity of instability threshold ) . in the absence of absorption ( or for @xmath286 ) , @xmath287 ( realistic in nematic liquid crystals ) and @xmath288 will suffice to get @xmath269 and reach the instability threshold .",
    "we note that in liquid crystals , optical nonlinearity is due to reorientation of molecules under the influence of electric field of electromagnetic wave and hence is essentially noninstantaneous .",
