    "in 1953 , ter - mikaelian @xcite noticed that at high energies the longitudinal momentum transferred at each scattering to an electron traversing a medium becomes very small .",
    "it enlarges the effective formation length for emitted photons and leads to specific effects in crystals .",
    "soon , landau and pomeranchuk @xcite remarked that it would result in the suppression of radiation in amorphous media if the formation length becomes large relative to the scattering mean free path of the electron .",

    "the purely diagrammatic approach has been advocated in the series of papers done in orsay @xcite which extended the treatment of lpm effect to the non - abelian case as well , in search for analogous effects in qcd started by gyulassy and wang @xcite .",
    "somewhat special treatment using the schrdinger equation and considering compact quark - antiquark - gluon systems has been proposed by b. zakharov @xcite who criticized some approximations used in papers @xcite .",
    "soon it was shown @xcite that with account of some additional terms omitted in @xcite the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "recently , novosibirsk group @xcite carefully considered different limiting cases of lpm effect in qed confronting them to experiment @xcite . even though being common in spirit and close in final results , these approaches use different technique and different models of a medium so that sometimes it is hard to judge the correspondence between them . at the same time , some limiting cases are preferable to treat by either one or another method .    here",
