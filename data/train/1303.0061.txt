    "two - photon  raman \" transitions act as an important control parameter in cold atom experiments .",
    "these optical transitions couple motional and internal degrees of freedom , mimicking important physical processes such as gauge fields @xcite and spin - orbital couplings @xcite .",
    "they have also been used as spectroscopic probes , for example allowing scientists to measure excitation spectra @xcite .",
    "the most exciting future applications of these techniques will involve strongly interacting atoms near feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "here we study the raman couplings as a function of magnetic field , quantifying the practicality of such experiments .",
    "we find that for relatively heavy atoms , such as @xmath4k , the raman techniques are compatible with the magnetic fields needed for feshbach resonances . despite important experimental demonstrations @xcite , lighter atoms , such as @xmath2li are less promising , as the ratio of raman rabi frequency to the inelastic scattering rate is not sufficiently large .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we are interested in two - photon transitions which take an atom between two hyperfine states @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "optical photons only couple to electronic motion in an atom .",
    "hence such raman transitions rely on fine and hyperfine interactions .",
    "the former couple electronic spins and motion , and the latter couple nuclear spins to the electronic angular momentum .",
    "one expects that magnetic fields will reduce these raman matrix elements , as the disparate zeeman coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom competes with the fine and hyperfine interactions .",
    "we find that at the typical magnetic fields of feshbach resonance ( @xmath0g@xmath1 g @xcite ) , the raman couplings are still quite strong .",
    "the exception is @xmath2li , where there is a factor of @xmath3 suppression , compared to its already small zero - field value .",
    "a key figure of merit in experiment is the ratio of the raman rabi frequency to the inelastic scattering rate @xmath7 .",
    "the inverse rabi frequency gives the time required for an atom to flip between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the inverse inelastic scattering rate gives the average time between photon absorption events , which leads to heating .",
    "for equilibrium experiments on raman - dressed atoms , one needs @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the chemical potential .",
    "a typical experiment takes one second .",
    "thus if @xmath10 , the inelastic light scattering has a large impact . as argued by spielman @xcite , both of these rates at sufficiently large detuning limit are proportional to the laser intensity and inversely proportional to the square of the detuning .",
    "we numerically calculate this ratio as a function of magnetic field , including all relevant single - particle physics .",
    "we also explore the detuning dependence of this ratio .",
