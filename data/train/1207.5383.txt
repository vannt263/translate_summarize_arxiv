    "a time - frequency representation of a distribution @xmath0 is a function defined on @xmath1 whose value at @xmath2 represents the influence of the frequency @xmath3 near @xmath4 .",
    "the short - time fourier transform ( stft ) is a standard choice for such a representation , popular in analysis and signal processing .",
    "it is defined , by means of an adequate smooth and fast - decaying window function @xmath5 , as @xmath6 if the window @xmath7 is normalized by @xmath8 , the distribution @xmath9 can be re - synthesized from its time - frequency content by @xmath10 this representation is extremely redundant .",
    "one of the aims of time - frequency analysis is to provide a representation of an arbitrary signal as a linear combination of elementary time - frequency atoms , which form a less redundant dictionary .",
    "the standard choice is to let these atoms be time - frequency shifts of a single window function @xmath7 , thus providing a uniform partition of the time - frequency plane .",
    "the resulting systems of atoms are known as _ gabor frames_. however , in certain applications atomic decompositions adapted to a less regular pattern may be required ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a time - frequency partition may be derived from perceptual considerations . for audio signals",
    ", this means that low frequency bins are given a finer resolution than bins in high regions , where better time - resolution is often desirable , cp .",
    "such a partition is schematically depicted in the left plot of figure  [ fig1.jpg ] .",
    "more irregular partitions may be desirable whenever the frequency characteristics of an analyzed signal change over time and require adaptation in both time _ and _ frequency .",
    "for example , adaptive partitions obtained from information theoretic criteria were suggested in  @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , partitions as irregular as shown in the right plot of figure  [ fig1.jpg ] can be appropriate .    in this article",
    "we consider the following problem .",
    "given a - possibly irregular - cover of the time - frequency plane @xmath11 , we wish to construct a frame for @xmath12 with atoms whose time - frequency concentration follows the shape of the cover members .",
    "this allows to vary the trade - off between time and frequency resolution along the time - frequency plane .",
    "the adapted frames are constructed by selecting , for each member of a given cover , a family of functions maximizing their concentration in the corresponding region of the time - frequency domain , or phase - space .",
    "these functions can be obtained as eigenfunctions of time - frequency localization operators , as we now describe .",
    "given a bounded measurable set @xmath13 in the time - frequency plane , the _ time - frequency localization operator _",
    "@xmath14 is defined by masking the coefficients in , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xmath15 @xmath14 is self - adjoint and trace - class , so we can consider its spectral decomposition @xmath16 where the eigenvalues are indexed in descending order .",
    "note that @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the first eigenfunction of @xmath18 is optimally concentrated inside @xmath19 in the following sense @xmath20    more generally , it follows from the courant minimax principle , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  95 ) , that the first @xmath21 eigenfunctions of @xmath18 form an orthonormal set in @xmath22 that maximizes the quantity @xmath23 among all orthonormal sets of @xmath21 functions in @xmath22 . in this sense ,",
    "their time - frequency profile is optimally adapted to @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig : efboxes ] illustrates this principle by showing some time - frequency boxes @xmath19 along with the stft and real part of the corresponding localization operator s first eigenfunctions .         based on these observations , we propose the following construction of frames .",
    "let @xmath24 be a cover of @xmath11 consisting of bounded measurable sets .",
    "in order to construct a frame adapted to the cover , we select , for each region @xmath25 , the first @xmath26 eigenfunctions @xmath27 of the operator @xmath28 .",
    "we will prove that there is a number @xmath29 such that if @xmath30 , then the collection of all the chosen eigenfunctions spans @xmath12 in a stable fashion .",
    "( here @xmath31 is the lebesgue measure of @xmath25 . )",
    "note that the condition @xmath30 is in accordance with the uncertainty principle , which roughly says that for each time - frequency region @xmath25 there are only approximately @xmath31 degrees of freedom .",
    "we allow for covers that are arbitrary in shape as long as they satisfy the following mild admissibility condition .",
    "an indexed set @xmath24 , is said to be an _",
    "admissible cover _ of @xmath11 if the following conditions hold .",
    "* @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "* for each @xmath34 , @xmath25 is a measurable subset of @xmath11 .",

    "* there exists @xmath36 such that @xmath37    under this condition we prove the following .    [ th_sample ] let @xmath24 be an admissible cover of @xmath11 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath29 such that for every choice of numbers @xmath38 satisfying @xmath39 the family of functions @xmath40 , obtained from the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the operators @xmath28 - cf . and - is a frame of @xmath12 .",
    "that is , for some constants @xmath41 , the following frame inequality holds @xmath42    theorem [ th_sample ] is proved at the end of section [ sec : foe ] .",
    "we also show that if an admissible cover @xmath24 satisfies the additional _ inner regularity condition _ :    * there exist @xmath43 such that @xmath44    then the statement of theorem [ th_sample ] remains valid , if the functions @xmath45 are replaced by their unweighted versions @xmath46 ( see theorem [ th_frames_tf_noeigen ] ) . in this case @xmath47 , so the lower bound on @xmath26 in the hypothesis of theorem [ th_sample ] can be expressed as @xmath48 , for some constant @xmath49 .",
    "while theorem  [ th_sample ] was our main motivation , it is just a sample of our results .",
    "the introduction of an abstract model for phase space provides sufficient flexibility to obtain variants of theorem  [ th_sample ] in the context of time - scale analysis ( theorem  [ th : wavcase ] ) and of discrete time - frequency representations ( theorem  [ th : gabmul ] ) .",
    "the proofs of the main results in this paper are based on two major observations .",
    "first , the norm equivalence , the statement @xmath50 means that there exist constants @xmath51 such that @xmath52 for all @xmath53 . ]",
    "@xmath54 holds for a family of time - frequency localization operators @xmath55 provided that the symbols @xmath56 satisfy @xmath57 and the enveloping condition @xmath58 the inequalities were first proved in @xcite for symbols of the form @xmath59 and @xmath60 , then for a general lattice in @xcite , and finally for fully irregular symbols satisfying in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the proofs in @xcite are _ based _ on the observation that under condition the norm - equivalence is equivalent to the fact that finitely many eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath61 generate a multi - window gabor frame over the lattice @xmath62 .",
    "the proof of the general case in @xcite does not explicitly involve the eigenfunctions of the operators @xmath63 nor does it rely on tools specific to gabor frames on lattices .",
    "thus the question arises whether it is also possible in the irregular case to construct a frame consisting of finite sets of eigenfunctions of the operators @xmath63 . here",
    ", this question is given a positive answer .",
    "second , the observation that remains valid when the operators @xmath63 are replaced by finite rank approximations @xmath64 obtained by thresholding their eigenvalues ,  cf .",
    "theorem  [ th_finite_rank_tf ] , is the core of the proof of our main results .",
    "this finite rank approximation is in turn achieved by proving that the operators @xmath63 behave `` globally '' like projectors .",
    "more precisely , in proposition  [ prop_squared_covers ] we obtain the following extension of @xmath65 this will allow us to `` localize in phase - space '' the @xmath66-norm estimates relating @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "note that , in general , the operators @xmath63 have infinite rank even if @xmath67 is the characteristic function of a compact set ( see lemma [ lemma_loc_infinite_rank ] ) .",
    "consequently @xmath68 and therefore the global properties of the family @xmath69 are crucial to prove .",
    "while the squared operators @xmath70 are not time - frequency localization operators , their time - frequency localizing behavior is preserved under conditions as given by and they are the prototypical example of a family of operators that is _ well - spread in the time - frequency plane_. the latter notion is defined in section  [ sec_abs_mol ] and we exploit the fact that the tools from @xcite are valid for these operator families .    for clarity , we choose to accentuate the case of time - frequency analysis but all the proofs are carried out in an abstract setting that yields , for example , analogous consequences in time - scale analysis .      the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_bla ] motivates the abstract model to study phase - space covers and gives the main examples to keep in mind .",
    "section  [ sec_abstract ] formally introduces the abstract model for phase - space and section  [ sec_abs_mol ] presents certain key technical notions , in particular the properties required for a family of localization operators to exhibit an almost - orthogonality property . in section  [ sec_tf ] , we first prove our results in the context of time - frequency analysis , where some technical problems of the abstract setting do not arise .",
    "in addition , in the context of time - frequency analysis , we are able to extend the result on phase - space adapted frames from @xmath71 to an entire class of banach spaces , the modulation spaces , by exploiting spectral invariance results for pseudodifferential operators .",
    "theorem  [ th_frames_tf ] in section  [ sec_frames_tf ] is the general version of theorem  [ th_sample ] stated above .",
    "this latter result in proved after theorem  [ th_frames_tf ] as an application .",
    "section  [ sec_abs_frames ] develops the results in the abstract setting .",
    "these are then applied to time - scale analysis in section  [ sec_wavelets ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec_gabor ] contains an additional application of the abstract results to time - frequency analysis , this time using gabor multipliers , which are time - frequency masking operators related to a discrete time - frequency representation ( gabor frame ) .",
    "the atoms thus obtained maximize their time - frequency concentration with respect to a weight on a discrete time - frequency grid and the resulting frames are relevant in numerical applications .    for clarity ,",
    "the presentation of the results highlights the case of time - frequency analysis , which was our main motivation .",
    "most of the technicalities in section [ sec_abstract ] are irrelevant to that setting ( although they are relevant for time - scale analysis ) .",
    "the reader interested mainly in time - frequency analysis is encouraged to jump directly to section [ sec_tf ] and then go back to sections [ sec_abstract ] and [ sec_abs_mol ] having a clear example in mind .",
    "the article also contains two appendices providing auxiliary results related to the almost - orthogonality tools from @xcite and spectral invariance of pseudodifferential operators .",
    "in this section , we introduce an abstract model for phase space . we first provide some motivation and the main examples to keep in mind .      in time - frequency analysis ,",
    "a distribution @xmath0 is studied by means of a time - frequency representation , e.g. the stft @xmath72 , cf .  .",
    "in signal processing , where @xmath9 is called a signal , the domain @xmath73 is referred to as _ signal space _ while @xmath1 is referred to as _ phase - space_. this terminology borrows some intuition from mechanics , where the position of a freely moving particle is described by a point @xmath4 in the configuration space @xmath73 , while @xmath74 describes a pair of position - momentum variables , belonging to the phase - space @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath9 can be resynthesized from @xmath75 - cf . -",
    "all its properties can in principle be reformulated as properties of @xmath75 . however , not every function on @xmath1 is the stft of a distribution on @xmath73 . indeed ,",
    "if we let @xmath76 be the image of @xmath71 under @xmath77 , it turns out that @xmath78 is a _ reproducing kernel space _ ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 3 and 11 ) ) .",
    "this means that @xmath78 is a closed subspace of @xmath79 consisting of continuous functions and that for all @xmath80 the evaluation functional @xmath81 is continuous . in particular @xmath82 .",
    "the fact that @xmath76 is a `` small '' subspace of @xmath71 is important to understand the problem studied in this article . in designing a frame for @xmath71 with a prescribed phase - space profile ,",
    "the challenge lies in the fact that the shapes we design in @xmath11 must correspond to functions in the small subspace @xmath78 .",
    "the role of time - frequency localization operators is crucial and will be detailed in the rest of this section .    for @xmath83 , the _ time - frequency localization operator _ with symbol @xmath84",
    "is @xmath85 if @xmath86 is the characteristic function of a set @xmath19 we write @xmath18 instead of @xmath87 ,  cf . .",
    "the stft ( with respect to a fixed normalized window @xmath88 ) defines a map @xmath89 .",
    "its adjoint @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 the inversion formula in says that @xmath92 .",
    "hence @xmath77 is an isometry on @xmath71 .",
    "consider a symbol @xmath83 and the time - frequency localization operator from .",
    "using @xmath77 and @xmath93 , the definition reads @xmath94 the fact that @xmath77 is an isometry with range @xmath78 implies that @xmath95 is the orthogonal projection @xmath96 .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath97 @xmath98 it follows from that @xmath99 since @xmath100 is the generic form of a function in @xmath78 , we obtain that @xmath101 this means that the time - frequency localization operator @xmath14 is unitarily equivalent to the operator @xmath102 given by @xmath103 the operator @xmath104 consists of multiplication by @xmath84 followed by projection onto @xmath78 .",
    "we will call these operators _ phase - space _ multipliers : they apply a mask @xmath84 to a function @xmath105 , typically yielding a function @xmath106 , and then provide the best @xmath66 approximation of @xmath107 within @xmath78 .",
    "( these operators are sometimes also called toeplitz operators for the stft . )",
    "the interpretation of time - frequency localization operators as phase - space multipliers ( multiplication followed by projection ) is central to this article .",
    "we will consider a general setting where the role of the stft can be replaced by other transforms .",
    "an important example is the wavelet transform of a function @xmath12 with respect to an adequate window @xmath108 , @xmath109 ( see section [ sec_wavelets ] for details . ) in analogy with time - frequency analysis , we still call @xmath110 the phase - space associated with the wavelet transform .",
    "this terminology is justified by the fact that there is a formal analogy between the two contexts .",
    "the range of the wavelet transform @xmath111 is , under suitable assumptions on @xmath112 , a reproducing kernel subspace of @xmath113 and time - scale localization operators are defined in analogy to the time - frequency localization operators ( see section [ sec_wavelets ] for explicit formulas ) .",
    "the similarity between the time - frequency and time - scale contexts stems from the fact that both are associated with representations of a locally - compact group . in the former case , the heisenberg group acts on @xmath71 by translations and modulations , while in the latter",
    ", the affine group acts by translations and dilations .",
    "the theory of _ coorbit spaces _",
    "@xcite treats this situation in general , studying the transform associated with the representation coefficients of a group action and associating a range of function spaces to it . the model for abstract phase space to be introduced in section  [ sec_abstract ] is largely inspired by @xcite .",
    "it allows for the simultaneous treatment of various settings , since it makes no explicit reference to an integral transform .",
    "the main ingredients are a `` big '' space @xmath114 called the environment and a `` small '' subspace called the atomic space . in the time - frequency example @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , the case of time - scale analysis ( wavelets ) uses @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "building on the intuition provided by time - frequency and time - scale analysis , we think of @xmath78 as a collection of phase - space representations for functions in @xmath71 , while the environment @xmath114 is big enough for certain operations , such as pointwise multiplication by arbitrary bounded measurable functions , to be well - defined .",
    "one central assumption of the model in section [ sec_abstract ] is then the existence of a projector @xmath119 , so that one can consider phase - space multipliers like in .",
    "the price to pay for this unified approach is a certain level of technicality .",
