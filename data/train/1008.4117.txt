    "metamaterials ( mm ) provide a large variety of unprecedented optical properties . whereas in its infancy properties such as a dispersive permeability were at the focus of interest @xcite , the range of properties to be intentionally affected by suitably chosen mms significantly increased . more and",
    "more complex @xcite and most notably , chiral @xcite or quasi - planar @xcite chiral structures attracted a great deal of attention due to their polarization selective optical response and their potential to implement functional devices with unprecedented applications such as , e.g. , broadband polarizers for circular light @xcite .",
    "moreover , from a scientific point of view , such complex mms permit to observe unexpected and counterintuitive effects like asymmetric transmission for circular @xcite or even for linearly polarized light @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that the assignment of effective material parameters is doubtful in many cases @xcite and generally requires the assumption of complex constitutive relations @xcite .",
    "thus a more suitable target function to be tailored by an appropriate mm design is the optical response itself .",
    "this optical response is completely involved in the response functions , such as complex reflection and transmission coefficients , for a given input illumination .",
    "this paradigm change reflects that for an actual application a certain value of some effective material coefficient is of minor importance , as long as the sample exhibits the desired optical response .",
    "the response , in particular in transmission , can then be easily described by transmittances and polarization ellipses , averaged polarization rotation and polarization conversion @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological quantities can be completely determined from the frequency dependent jones matrix @xcite that relates the complex amplitudes of the incident to the transmitted field .",
    "we will term this jones matrix throughout the manuscript the t - matrix since it fully describes how the light is transmitted through a metamaterial slab .",
    "this 2 @xmath0 2 matrix comprises , in general , four different complex and dispersive quantities , reflecting the spectral properties of the mm .",
    "the associated jones calculus can be applied to describe the transmission of an arbitrarily polarized incident plane wave through a mm slab if only the zeroth order bloch mode emerges .",
    "this holds for mms composed of periodically arranged sub - wavelength unit cells and we will assume this throughout the manuscript .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we also assume that the structures are symmetrically embedded .",
    "we assume that all materials are linear and reciprocal , i.e. , excluding faraday media .",
    "no further restrictions on the symmetry of the unit cells and the generally complex permittivity of the constituting materials are necessary .    with this work",
    "we intend to introduce a classification of periodic metamaterials based on their symmetry properties and to link them to their specific t - matrix .",
    "we will show that all metamaterials can be divided into only five distinct classes , each having an individual form of the t - matrix and specific eigenstates .",
    "each of these five classes leads to a very specific transmission characteristics directly linked to the symmetry of the structure .",
    "therefore , this investigation provides a useful tool to analyze the optical response of complex mms and it may serve as a guide to identify designs for a desired polarization response .",
    "although for fabricated mm the geometry is usually known , the application of combinatorial approaches to explore new mm geometries in the near future requires such tool to classify the properties of mms .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the necessary fundamentals to handle the generally complex valued t - matrices and derive general expressions for the eigenpolarizations . in sec .",
    "iii we derive the form of the t - matrix for the most relevant symmetry classes . in sec .",
    "iv we provide examples of metamaterials for these symmetry classes and discuss briefly their optical behavior . in sec . v a comprehensive tabular overview",
    "is given to summarize the results and we present a simple scheme to classify mm samples without having a priori knowledge in terms of the presented formalism by measured transmittances only .",
    "it is assumed that the mm slab is illuminated by a plane wave propagating in positive @xmath1-direction @xmath2 with @xmath3 being its frequency , @xmath4 the wavevector , and the complex amplitudes @xmath5 and @xmath6 describing the state of polarization . the transmitted field",
    "is then given by @xmath7 where we have assumed that the medium is sandwiched between a medium characterized by the permittivity @xmath8 .",
    "a sketch of the geometry is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_kos ] .",
    "the unit cells are periodically arranged in @xmath9- and @xmath10-direction without restricting to a particular lattice .",
    "we assume coherent , monochromatic plane waves so to use a generalized jones calculus instead of the mueller calculus necessary for incoherent light @xcite .",
    "the jones calculus is said to be generalized since we allow for arbitrary complex jones matrices which we will call t - matrices ( transmission matrices ) .",
    "the t - matrix connects the generally complex amplitudes of the incident and the transmitted field : @xmath11 where for convenience we have replaced the entries @xmath12 by @xmath13 which form the actual t - matrix . in the following few subsections we will discuss some generic properties of this t - matrix .      in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq_linforward ] ) the t - matrix superscript f designates propagation in forward direction . of course , the choice of forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) propagation is arbitrary .",
    "thus @xmath14 describes the transmission matrix for light propagating through the structure rotated by @xmath15 with        respect to the @xmath16axis , where the choice of @xmath9 or @xmath10 is arbitrary .    since only reciprocal media are considered we have : @xmath17 where the minus sign in the off - diagonal elements accounts for the rotation of the system looking from the backside @xcite",
    "therefore , the complex matrix @xmath18 already contains all information necessary to determine light transmission for arbitrarily polarized incident light from both main illumination directions .",
    "its is important to stress that this relation between @xmath18 and @xmath14 is in general only valid for this particular base where the coordinate axis from the backside are given by replacing those of the frontside by @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the actual sign depends on the definition of the rotation of the system .      for analytical as well as for experimental concerns",
    "it is useful to have at hand the transmission matrix in an arbitrary not necessarily orthogonal base .",
    "let the vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the incident and the transmitted light in a certain base .",
    "then the incident and the transmitted light in the cartesian base is given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , with @xmath25 being the change of basis matrix .",
    "hence , the t - matrix for this new base is given by @xmath26 all representations of the system are completely equivalent of course .",
    "a transformation of practical importance is the change from the cartesian base to the circular base .",
    "then the change of basis matrix reads as @xmath27 where the columns of the @xmath28 matrix are the new eigenstates . the t - matrix for circular states is then given by : @xmath29 @xmath30 & \\left[a - d - i(b+c)\\right ] \\\\",

    "it becomes obvious that the t - matrix for backward propagation is given by : @xmath32 note that the matrix @xmath33 in an arbitrary base is not simply given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_linbackward ] ) , i.e. by interchanging the negative off - diagonal elements but by applying the corresponding change of basis matrix @xmath28 to @xmath34 and @xmath33 in the linear base individually .",
    "although not having discussed any symmetry property at all , we want to discuss at this point the special effect of asymmetric transmission which attracted considerable interest due to its counter - intuitive occurrence and discuss peculiarities related to a change of the base .",
    "the difference of the t - matrices for opposite propagation directions is the key to that asymmetric transmission . by asymmetric transmission @xmath35",
    "we understand the difference in the modulus of the total transmission between forward and backward propagation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_kos ] ) for a certain base vector , e.g. @xmath36 : @xmath37 this quantity obviously depends on the chosen base , e.g. , for a linear state coinciding with the coordinate axis we have ( @xmath38 ) : @xmath39 whereas in the circular base we have ( @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 in general .",
    "this dependency on the base is exploited e.g. in [ ] where asymmetric transmission for circularly polarized light is observed without asymmetric transmission for linear polarized light .",
    "hence , the only proper choice is a linear base with base vectors parallel to the principal coordinate axes . only in this base",
    "we can distinguish asymmetric transmission due to the structure from asymmetric transmission due to the chosen base .      to characterize the different structures it is useful to determine the eigenstates of the polarization because they are uniquely related to the symmetry .",
    "therefore , a simple eigenvalue problem has to be solved : @xmath42 with the eigenvalue @xmath43 . by solving these equations",
    "we obtain : @xmath44,\\label{eq_eigvalsol}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 gives the complex transmission for the eigenstates .",
    "the eigenpolarizations are then given by simply inserting @xmath45 into eq .",
    "( [ eq_eigvalprob ] ) and solving for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenbasis in matrix form can be written as @xmath46 with @xmath47 where the eigenvectors are not normalized yet .",
    "it is important to note that the eigenbasis depends in general on the frequency due to the dispersive behavior of the transmission . only for highly symmetric structures",
    "the eigenbasis is frequency independent as will be shown later . with the use of the characteristic polynomial of eq .",
    "( [ eq_eigvalprob ] ) the matrix @xmath28 can be rewritten as @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "note that the matrices @xmath28 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_eigbasematrix1 ] ) and ( [ eq_eigbasematrix2 ] ) are different but both are denoted simply by @xmath28 not to confuse the reader with additional indices .",
    "they are only a concatenation of eigenvectors that are determined up to an arbitrary complex factor .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 becomes unique as soon as the eigenvectors are normalized .",
    "the fractions in eq .",
    "( [ eq_eigbasematrix2 ] ) are complex numbers , hence we can express the eigenbasis as : @xmath50 with @xmath51 the eigenvectors are obviously orthogonal only if @xmath52 this is only the case for linear , circular and a special class of elliptical polarization . in all other cases",
    "the eigenstates are non - orthogonal @xcite .",
    "note that systems with orthogonal eigenstates are sometimes termed homogeneous systems whereas systems with non - orthogonal states are termed inhomogeneous ones @xcite .",
    "once the eigenstates are derived , the transmission matrix can be determined within this eigenbase by applying the transformation  ( [ eq_basetransform ] ) .",
    "the corresponding t - matrix is then diagonal .",
    "nevertheless using the t - matrix in the eigenbase is only appropriate and convenient if the eigenstates are orthogonal and frequency independent .",
    "the five different classes of periodic metamaterials that can be distinguished are closely related to their eigenstates .",
    "these five possible sets of eigenstates are linear , circular and elliptic ones , whereas the elliptic ones can be separated into co - rotating , counter - rotating and general elliptic states with no fixed relation between @xmath53 and @xmath54 . later on",
    "we will show how the symmetry class determines the respective eigenstate .",
    "by the symmetry considerations in the next subsections we will show how the symmetry properties of the structure affect the symmetry of the t - matrix .",
    "the arising t - matrices can be reduced to five principal forms where in general a larger number of distinct matrices is possible by rotating the structure by an arbitrary angle with respect to the @xmath1-axis . on the other hand",
    "such rotations can be used to remove redundant information .",
    "rotation by an angle @xmath55 is accomplished by applying the following matrix operation : @xmath56 resulting in the new t - matrix @xmath57 of the rotated sample .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of the rotated system are invariant to this operation and are uniquely related to the principal symmetry .",
    "the actual form of the matrices and the derived , redundant matrices will be given later in section iv to keep this part consistent .",
    "in general all complex components of the t - matrix are different if the metamaterial does not exhibit any reflection or rotational symmetry .",
    "if such type of symmetry exists the components of the t - matrix must reflect that .",
    "we will therefore briefly discuss a varous symmetries and their corresponding impact on the t - matrices .",
    "if the metamaterial is mirror - symmetric with respect to the @xmath58plane , the t - matrix for the structure reflected at that plane is identical to the original one .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath59 @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the reflection matrix with respect to the x - axis .",
    "so any structure that obeys that symmetry may be obviously described by a diagonal t - matrix .",
    "if the metamaterial is mirror - symmetric with respect to the @xmath62plane , we have : @xmath63 @xmath64 hence , if there exists any mirror plane parallel to the @xmath1-axis the t - matrix is diagonal provided that the mirror plane coincides with the @xmath16 or @xmath65axes , respectively . in such a system",
    "the eigenstates of the polarization are obviously linear states .",
    "if the structure is @xmath66-symmetric with respect to the @xmath1-axis , we have : @xmath67 hence rotating any structure by @xmath15 with respect to the @xmath68axis does not change the response at all .",
    "even if the structure does not have any further symmetry it fulfills that relation .",
    "if the structure is @xmath69-symmetric with respect to the @xmath1-axis , we have : @xmath70 however that symmetry is almost never met without additional metamaterial mirror symmetries but given here for completeness .",
    "if the structure is @xmath71-symmetric with respect to the @xmath1-axis , we have : @xmath72 @xmath73 hence the structure is insensitive to linear polarized light of any state . if there is an additional mirror - symmetry with respect to a plane parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath68axis , the off - diagonal elements will vanish resulting in an completely polarization independent structure .",
    "otherwise the eigenstates will be circularly polarized as will be shown later in detail .",
    "further important conclusions can be drawn by investigating the possible mirror symmetries with respect to a plane perpendicular to the @xmath68axis . if the structure possesses this type of symmetry , the reflected structure is the same as seen from the backside : @xmath74 @xmath75 i.e. , the off - diagonal elements are identical .",
    "if the system possesses a center of inversion the matrix has also this form , because inversion is equivalent to applying a reflection and a subsequent rotation by @xmath76 , where the latter does not change the response as shown in eq .",

    "the components of the t - matrix for those structures are all different . in the context of the basic geometry analyzed here there",
    "exist only two exceptions . the first one is already discussed within the context of eq .",

    "the structure is identical from both sides , hence @xmath78",
    "to understand the usefulness of the approach presented , we will discuss the different symmetry classes for simple examples .",
    "the metaatoms exemplarily shown in the following are assumed to be periodically arranged in @xmath16 and @xmath10-direction .",
    "importantly , the symmetry constraints applied to the unit cell have to be consistent with the symmetry of the lattice .",
    "that is crucial since e.g. even an achiral metaatom , can result in a chiral structure by a proper arrangement on a periodic lattice @xcite .",
    "the most significant symmetry is that of reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath16 or @xmath65axis or both . as already explained within the context of eqs .",

    "there , the unit cell consisting of four split - ring resonators has no rotational symmetry . but",
    "reflecting the structure at a plane diagonal to the given unit cell leads to a structure that is shifted by half a period in @xmath16 or @xmath65direction .",
    "due to the invariance of the optical response for periodic systems to any translation , this mirror plane leads in fact to linearly polarized eigenstates .",
    "therefore , rotating the structure by 45@xmath81 results in a diagonal t - matrix .",

    "if both aforementioned procedures do not provide a positive results , the structure is more complex and the measurements become more difficult too . to distinguish between the remaining possible forms it is necessary to measure the off - diagonal entries of the t - matrix simultaneously .",
    "if these off - diagonal elements are identical for a fixed wavelength and a fixed rotation angle independent of their particular choice , the structure is generalized anisotropic . if the off - diagonal elements are identical only for a fixed rotation angle but for every wavelengths the structure is generalized chiral . in all other cases we have @xmath128 .",
    "+ by using circular polarized light a similar scheme can be obtained however it would require circular analyzers as well .",
    "taking advantage of symmetry considerations we have analyzed the potential of various mms to affect the polarization state of light upon transmission . by focusing the attention on any optical response that is directly accessible in an experiment",
    ", the properties of mms may become so involved that the establishment of valid constitutive relation may be beyond what is possible for structures with an ever increasing complexity .",
    "we have explicitly shown that all mms belong to one of five different classes ; each being characterized by certain relations that connect the entries of the t - matrix and each class is able to support specific polarization phenomena .",
    "the sub - wavelength nature of mms is the only requirement for these considerations .",
    "moreover , the symmetry operations applied to the metaatoms have to be consistent with the symmetry of the lattice and it is required that the mm is sandwiched between identical media .",
    "nonetheless , we have explicitly listed all relevant structures where a violation of this assumption causes deviations . to foster practical application of this classification",
    "we have finally provided a protocol useful to reveal the underlying symmetry of an unknown mm and its t - matrix from far - field measurements of the transmitted intensities only .",
    "once it is identified , all the achievable optical properties that affect the state of polarization are fully disclosed .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the german federal ministry of education and research ( metamat and phona ) and by the thuringian state government ( mema ) ."
