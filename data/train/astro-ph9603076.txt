    "a word on the reliability of their p - l relation is therefore in place .",
    "the p - l relation of madore & freedman ( 1991 ) , adopted in the following , _ assumes _ an lmc modulus of 18.50 .",
    "actual confirmation of this value to better than 0.10  mag comes from the p - l relation calibrated by galactic cepheids ( sandage & tammann 1968 ; feast & walker 1987 ) and independently from the ring of sn  1987a ( panagia et al .",
    "1991 ; gould 1994 ) ; further support is given by rr  lyr stars and other distance determinations ( cf .",
    "tammann 1996 ) .",
    "the zero point of the adopted p - l relation is therefore secure to @xmath27 in linear distance .",
    "the slope of the relation is well determined by the lmc cepheids ; it is of less importance as long as the cepheids under consideration cover a sufficient period range , which is also needed to avoid selection effects ( sandage 1988 ) .",
    "metallicity effects are believed to be small ( freedman & madore 1990 ; chiosi et al .  1993 ) .",
    "when the first reliable cepheid distance of a virgo galaxy ( ngc  4321 ) became available from _ hst _ ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 ) it was precipitately hailed _ the _ virgo cluster distance ( mould et al .",
    "1995 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1995 ) , although the value of 17  mpc was suspiciously low .",
    "the next two virgo galaxies , ngc  4536 ( saha et al .",
    "1996a ) and ngc  4496a ( saha et al .",
    "1996b ) , again had very low distances .",
    "only the fourth galaxy , ngc  4639 , revealed the _ important depth _ of the cluster ( note for comparison : the spiral members span @xmath28 in the sky ! ) .",
    "its distance is 25  mpc ( sandage et al .",
    "1996 ) and yet it is a bona fide cluster member ; with a _ small _ velocity of 800  kms@xmath29 it can not be assigned to the background .",
    "it is no accident that the first three virgo spirals with cepheid distances lie on the near side of the cluster .",
    "they were selected from sandage & bedke s ( 1988 ) atlas of galaxies most suited for _ hst _ ; they were thus biased to begin with .",
    "ngc  4639 looks much more difficult and would not have been selected had it not produced the archetypal sn 1990n .",
    "it is now clear that it will take at least a dozen cepheid distances of a randomly selected sample of virgo members to obtain a meaningful mean cluster distance .",
    "meanwhile tanvir et al .  (",
    "1995 ) have suggested to step up their cepheid - based leo group distance of @xmath30 out to the virgo cluster by means of _ relative _ distance determinations .",
    "the best available relative distances are compiled in table  2 .",
    "adding the mean difference of @xmath31 to the above distance modulus gives a virgo cluster modulus of @xmath32 .",

    "this sample together with equation ( 1 ) gives @xmath46 .",

    "the peak of the luminosity function ( lf ) of _ globular clusters _ ( gc ) has frequently been used as a standard candle . a modern calibration of the gcs in the galaxy and in m31 combined with a compilation of published gclfs in five virgo ellipticals has led to a virgo modulus of @xmath48 ( sandage & tammann 1995 ) .",

    "however , the gcs in ngc  4486 have a bimodal color distribution which is suggestive of age differences and possible merger effects ( fritze - von alvensleben 1995 ; elson & santiago 1996 ) . turning a blind eye to this problem and averaging over all available gclfs in virgo",
    "we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "we are aware that the method may still face considerable problems .",
    "the _ @xmath53 method _ , normally applied to ellipticals , was extended to the bulges of s0 and spiral galaxies by dressler ( 1987 ) . using the bulges of the galaxy , m31 , and m81 as local calibrators , one obtains @xmath54 ( tammann 1988 ) .",
    "_ novae _ are potentially powerful distance indicators through their luminosity - decline rate relation . using the galactic calibration of cohen ( 1985 ) , capaccioli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) have found the _ _ apparent distance modulus of m31 to be @xmath55 ( i.e. somewhat less than indicated by cepheids ) . from six novae in three",
    "virgo ellipticals pritchet & van den bergh ( 1987 ) concluded that the cluster is more distant by @xmath56  mag than the apparent modulus of m31 , implying @xmath57 ( zero absorption is adopted for the virgo cluster , see section 2.6 ) .",
    "the result carries still small weight , but is interesting because it is based on novae exclusively .",
    "_ hst _ observations , although time - consuming , of novae in the virgo cluster could much improve this _",
    "independent _ result .",
    "theoretical _ models of sne ia _ by various authors converge towards @xmath58 for `` branch normal '' objects ( branch 1996 ; hflich & khokhlov 1996 ; ruiz - lapuente 1996 ) .",
    "it is true that fainter , nearby sne ia are known , but being red and spectroscopically peculiar they can easily be singled out , and they do not contaminate distant , luminosity - selected samples of sne ia ( cf .  section 3 ) .",
    "eight sne ia which have occurred in the virgo cluster have @xmath59  mag .",
    "this value combined with the theoretical calibration gives @xmath60 .",
    " had we used instead the empirical calibration of table  5 below , the virgo modulus would have become larger by 0.08  mag .",
    "we refrain from using this value because the routes towards @xmath7 in sections 2 and 3 are to be kept strictly apart .",
    "the assumption that the lf of the _ shells of planetary nebulae _ ( pn ) in the light of the @xmath61  line had a universal cutoff at @xmath62  mag has led to a virgo modulus significantly lower than obtained from the six methods discussed above ( jacoby et al .",
    "yet it was pointed out that the cutoff magnitude depends on the sample size ( i.e.  the absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy ; bottinelli et al .",
    "1991 ; tammann 1993 ) .",
    "numerically simulated lfs of the shell luminosities confirm indeed the dependence on sample size _ and _ population age ( mndez et al .",
    "1993 ) . as a consequence",
    "the published pn distances deviate systematically from the cepheid distances .",
    "the deviations increase with distance from m81 ( jacoby et al .",
    "1989 ) , ngc  5253 ( jacoby & ciardullo 1993 ) , and the leo group ( ciardullo et al .",
    "1989 ) to reach at the virgo cluster ( jacoby et al .",
    "1990 ) 0.74  mag !  a new method to derive pn distances , allowing for sample size and other effects , has been proposed by soffner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; the first result for the nearby galaxy ngc  300 is encouraging .    _ surface brightness fluctuations",
    "_ ( sbf ) have also been proposed as distance indicators ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) .",
    "the first `` test '' has remained rather unconvincing , spreading the _ elliptical _ virgo cluster members over an interval of 12 to 24 mpc ( tonry et al .",
    "1990 ) ; this interval was interpreted as real although early - type galaxies are known to be concentrated in the _ cores _ of galaxy clusters .",
    "moreover the individual distances correlate with the mg@xmath63 index ( lorenz et al .",
    "finally we note that the sbf distances of ngc  5253 ( phillips et al .",
    "1992 ) , the leo group ( tonry 1991 ) , and the virgo cluster ( tonry 1991 ) are smaller than cepheid distances by as much as 0.97 , 0.48 , and 0.56  mag , respectively .    for the said reasons we use neither the pn nor the sbf distances .      a census of the virgo cluster containing almost 2000 certain and possible members ( binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ) reveals a complex structure with two main subclusters a and b and additional concentrations some of which , particularly in the south - western part , are more distant . to obtain a genuine cluster sample",
    "we restrict the sample to the 364 galaxies with known redshifts lying within the outer isopleths of subclusters a and b ( binggeli et al .",
    "1993 ; the individual galaxies are listed there ) .",
    "their mean velocity is @xmath64 ( with respect to the local group centroid ) . if one considers instead the 361 galaxies within the very similar x - ray contour of the cluster ( bhringer et al .",
    "1994 ) the mean velocity becomes @xmath65 .",
    "taking all 385 galaxies with redshifts in the virgo survey area , excluding only background objects , we find @xmath66 . from this",
    "we adopt a best cluster velocity of @xmath67 .",
    "this result supersedes an early value of @xmath68 ( huchra 1988 ) which was based on only 250 galaxies and a less well defined area .    to obtain the _ cosmic _ recession velocity of the virgo cluster the observed value",
    "must still be corrected for the deceleration of the local group .",
    "we adopt @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "tammann 1996 ) and find for virgo @xmath70    yet we prefer a very similar value the rational of which , however , is quite different .",
    "many authors step up the virgo distance out to the coma cluster using the _ relative _ distance modulus between virgo and coma , and find @xmath7 at the distance of coma .",
    "one can repeat that with any cluster whose distance relative to virgo is known .",
    "in fact there are at least 14 clusters with rather good relative distances and velocities @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the velocity in the frame of the microwave background ) .",
    "the best cosmic value of @xmath7 is then the all - sky mean over 14 different @xmath7 determinations .",
    "but more elegant is the reverse method : the relative distances are used to scale down the velocities of the 14 clusters and to predict a mean virgo cluster velocity , i.e.  the @xmath73 velocity which the cluster would have in the absence of all local deviations from an ideal expansion field .",
    "the result of this procedure is @xmath74 ( sandage & tammann 1990 , jerjen & tammann 1993 ; jerjen 1995 for a more rigid error determination ) .",
    "the six independent distance determinations of the virgo cluster in sections 2.1  2.3 are repeated in table  4 .",
    "all distance moduli are taken to be true values , i.e.  zero absorption is assumed towards the virgo cluster .",
    "if the @xmath47-absorption implied by burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) is applied individually to all galaxies used for the distance determinations , the modulus becomes lower by only 0.06 mag .",
    "even this almost negligible amount may be an overestimation as discussed by sandage & tammann ( 1996 ) .",

    "an _ hst _ program has been mounted to determine the large - scale value of @xmath7 .",
    "the aim is to derive cepheid distances ( in @xmath49 and @xmath50 to control absorption effects ) of up to ten galaxies which have produced well observed sne ia .",

    "1996 ; tammann et al .",

    "the agreement to within the errors between the individual luminosities supports the claim that sne ia are ( nearly ) perfect standard candles .",

    "their _ intrinsic _ luminosity scatter must be considerably less than 0.35 mag , because much of the scatter is expected from observational errors and peculiar motions .",
    "indeed the intrinsic scatter must be very small because even the most distant sne ia lie very close to the theoretical hubble line of slope 0.2 .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "the most distant sne ia occupy a volume about 18000 times larger than that of the local calibrators .",
    "the large volume must contain exceptionally luminous sne ia  if they existed  and they have a much enhanced discovery chance for two reasons : their apparent magnitude is brighter than average _ and _ they stay longer above the detection limit . but still , there are no objects significantly above the hubble line , not even at large distances .",
    "this means : the sample of sne ia shown in fig .",
    "1 constitutes a homogeneous class of very luminous and unabsorbed objects .",
    "when in the following the calibration of table 3 is applied to the sne ia in fig .",
    "1 , it should be kept in mind that branch normal  sne ia ( cf .",
    "branch et al .",
    "1993 ) are compared with the most luminous sne ia known .",
    "therefore the resulting value of @xmath7 can only be , if anything , an upper limit .    forcing a slope of 5 ( corresponding to _ linear _ expansion ) to the data in fig .",
    "1 gives @xmath111 and @xmath112 an easy calculation shows that the constant term @xmath113 in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is determined by @xmath114 inserting @xmath115 and @xmath116 from table  5 leads directly to @xmath117 and @xmath118 , from which we adopt @xmath119 equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are defined out to @xmath120 kms@xmath29 .",
    "the value of @xmath121 therefore represents the truly cosmic expansion rate .    at a time when only the very first calibrating sne ia were known",
    "it was suggested that sn 1972e was overluminous on the basis of its light curve shape ( hamuy et al .",
    "1995 ; riess et al .  1995 ) and that consequently the true value of @xmath121 was larger . in the light of seven calibrators",
    "this argument is now impossible . from first principles of stellar statistics",
    "it is known that _ seven nearby _ objects can on average not be more luminous than a distant , _ luminosity - segregated _ sample .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .  2 , where the absolute magnitudes of the seven calibrators are compared to the absolute magnitudes of the distant sn sample .",
    "the latter are calculated once with @xmath122 and once with @xmath123 .",
    "for @xmath123 the absurd situation arises that the distant sn ia are systematically fainter than the nearby calibrators .",
    "the firm conclusion from this is that @xmath124 .",

    "their only interdependence is that they rely on cepheids ( predominantly observed with _ hst _ ) , which are the least controversial distance indicators at present .",
    "together they make a strong case for @xmath10 ( external error ) .",
    "values of @xmath128 are equally unlikely as values of @xmath129 .    the relatively low value of @xmath7 is supported by additional methods , e.g.  tf and other distances of field galaxies ( sandage 1994 , 1996 and references therein ) , and the zeldovich - sunyaev effect ( lasenby & hancock 1995 , rephaeli 1995 ) .",
