    "manifestations of the weak interaction of quarks have been searched for since madame chien - shiung wu presented the evidence for parity violation in @xmath0-decay of @xmath1co and leon lederman for parity violation in @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay .",
    "for instance , neil tanner shortly thereafter , studied the 340 kev resonance in the @xmath8 reaction to the @xmath9o ground state forbidden by angular momentum and parity conservation.[1 ] the hadronic weak interaction is studied by observing non - leptonic flavor changing decays of mesons and baryons and by measuring observables that conserve flavor but that violate reflection symmetry of the strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "one approach that has been pursued is the study of parity forbidden transitions between nuclear states in particular in the light nuclei .",
    "it was realized that two accidental aspects of nuclear structure in certain nuclei could amplify the expected effects of parity violation by several orders of magnitude beyond the nominal @xmath10 .",
    "the amplification arises from the near - degeneracy of opposite parity states that are mixed by the hadronic weak interaction and from the interference of an otherwise by parity conservation forbidden transition amplitude with a much stronger parity allowed transition amplitude . although the weak quark - quark interaction has been well established its appearance in nuclear systems is clouded by effects of nuclear structure and by the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the non - perturbative regime . within the meson exchange description of the strong interaction , theory and experiment",
    "meet in a set of seven weak meson - nucleon coupling constants as defined in the seminal paper by desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) .",
    "[ 2 ] it is assumed that the parity violating",
    "n - n interaction is governed by the exchange of the pion and the two lightest vector mesons .",
    "the seven weak meson nucleon coupling constants are designated @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , where the superscript indicates the isospin and the subscript the exchanged meson . of these @xmath13",
    "was omitted from further consideration due to the difficulty calculating it .",
    "desplanques , donoghue , and holstein provided ` reasonable ranges ' and ` best values ' for the weak meson nucleon couplings constants .",
    "these are given in table 1 together with values for the latter from two similar theoretical approaches ( dubovic and zenkin [ 3 ] , and feldman et al .",
    "[ 4 ] ) .",
    "the experimental results from the nuclear parity violating measurements have been analyzed using the framework of desplanques , donoghue , and holstein leading to constraints on combinations of the weak meson nucleon coupling constants .",
    "there is a measure of agreement with the theoretical ` reasonable ranges ' although also experimentally the allowed ranges of values are large .",
    "note that there exist two experimental inconsistencies as depicted in fig .",
    "1 : the value of @xmath11 deduced from the @xmath15-decays of @xmath16f is consistent with zero while the result deduced from the anapole moment of @xmath17cs indicates a difference from zero with several standard deviations .",
    "the other inconsistency is possibly in the results deduced from the anapole moments of @xmath18tl and @xmath17cs .    ) .",
    "the combinations of the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants are : @xmath19 and @xmath20    more straightforward in terms of interpretation are the measurements of the proton - proton parity violating analyzing powers or asymmetries ( the normalized differences in scattering yields for positive and negative helicity incident beams ) for which there exist three precision experiments ( from the university of bonn at 13.6 mev [ 6 ] , from psi at 45 mev [ 7 ] , and from triumf at 221 mev [ 8 ] ) .",
    "these experiments required unprecedented precision in controlling systematic errors and in particular those due to helicity correlated false asymmetries .",
    "the parity violating analyzing powers are compared to more recent theoretical calculations in the framework of weak meson - nucleon couplings in fig .",
    "( see [ 8 ] )     in which the weak meson nucleon coupling constants were fitted to the data . ]",

    ". clearly even more precise measurements of the proton - proton analyzing powers are required in order to better constrain the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .     and @xmath23 as deduced from the proton - proton parity violating analyzing powers .",
    "[ 9 ] the figure shows contours of constant total @xmath24 .",
    "the axes scales are in units of @xmath25 . ]",
    "the extensive development of chiral perturbation theory and",
    "n - n effective field theory and substantial progress in performing lattice qcd calculations have opened up new approaches of studying the hadronic weak interaction . for a recent review see ref .",
    "10 . in principle",
    "it is now possible to make qcd based predictions for weak hadronic interaction phenomena . on the experimental side",
    "there are several promising precision parity violation measurements in progress .",
    "foremost to be mentioned is the measurement of the parity violating asymmetry in the capture of polarized neutrons on hydrogen ( the npdgamma experiment ) .",
    "others are the parity violating neutron spin rotation in helium and in hydrogen .",
    "( see ref .",
    "the situation with regard to parity violating analyzing power measurements in polarized electron scattering is quite different .",
    "originally , in the low energy regime , these measurements were made to determine the weak mixing angle or @xmath26 .",
    "soon thereafter these measurements were overtaken by measurements at the @xmath6 pole at lep of cern and slc of slac .",
    "given the current knowledge of the electroweak interaction and the great precision with which electroweak radiative corrections can be calculated , the current round of parity violating electron scattering experiments has as one of its objectives to probe the structure of the nucleon and in particular the contributions of the strange quarks ( the quark - antiquark pairs of the sea ) to the weak charge and magnetization distributions of the nucleons . with the couplings of both photons and z bosons to point - like quarks",
    "well defined ( see table 2 ) , it is possible to separate the contributions of the various flavors . the electromagnetic and weak charge and magnetic form factors of the proton",
    "can be written : @xmath27 heavier flavor contributions are neglected .",
    "assuming charge symmetry in the quark distributions , one can write an analogous expression for the neutron : @xmath28 clearly , in addition to the electromagnetic form factors for the proton and the neutron one needs one further relation , which is provided by the parity violating analyzing power @xmath29 : @xmath30/[n^{+ } + n^{- } ] \\\\",

    "the three new form factors @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 can be determined by measuring parity violating electron elastic scattering from the proton at forward and backward angles , and quasi - elastic scattering from the deuteron at backward angles .     as deduced from the g0 , happex , and pva4 experiments .",
    "the blue - gray band indicates the dominant systematic uncertainty in the g0 results . ]    presently there exist published data on a combination @xmath40 , with @xmath41 a coefficient dependent on the four - momentum transfer , from the sample experiment at mit - bates [ 11 ] , the happex [ 12 ] and g0 [ 13 ] experiments at jlab , and the pva4 experiment at mami 14 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . there is consistency between the various experimental results .",
    "the data indicate tiny non - zero values for the combination @xmath40 .",
    "the backward angle data on hydrogen and deuterium of the g0 experiment are being analyzed , while further measurements are on the schedules of jlab ( happex ) and of mami ( pva4 ) . extrapolating the forward angle results towards zero four - momentum transfer and zero scattering angle ,",
    "has provided a factor of five improvement in the knowledge of the neutral weak couplings to the ` up ' and ` down ' quarks [ 15 ] compared to the entries in the pdg handbook of 2006 .",
    "in going to lower and lower four - momentum transfer and small scattering angle in parity violating electron elastic scattering from the proton , the contributions due to the finite size of the proton become smaller and smaller and one is able to measure then the weak charge of the proton , which constitutes the sum of the weak charges of the two ` up ' quarks and the ` down ' quark .",
    "however , the analyzing power becomes zero at zero momentum transfer and therefore optimum values of four - momentum transfer and incident energy need to be sought .",
    "a high precision measurement of the parity violating analyzing power determines the value of @xmath26 and consequently the variation of @xmath26 with four - momentum transfer or the ` running ' of @xmath26 .",
    "the standard model makes a definitive prediction of the ` running ' of @xmath26 taking into account electroweak radiative corrections once the value of @xmath26 at the @xmath6 pole has been reproduced . as with the qed and qcd couplings , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( which exhibit screening and anti - screening , respectively ) , in going to higher and higher four - momentum transfer , @xmath26 is an effective parameter also varying with @xmath44 . in this case",
    "the behaviour with @xmath34 is more subtle since @xmath26 is a function of the electroweak couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 .",
    "any deviation of @xmath26 from its standard model value points to new physics , which needs to be incorporated through a set of new diagrams . in going to very high energies",
    "it is plausible that the strong , electromagnetic , and weak interactions become the same .",
    "in fact extrapolations to very high energies of the three coupling constants show a ` near - miss ' towards having a common intersection ( see fig .",
    "extensions of the standard model are therefore in order .",
    "measurements at the @xmath6 pole have established the value of @xmath26 with great precision although it must be remarked that the leptonic and semi - leptonic values of @xmath26 differ by @xmath48 .",
    "the standard model ` running ' of @xmath26 has been calculated by erler , kurylov , and ramsey - musolf [ 16 ] in the modified minimal subtraction scheme ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in the ` running ' of @xmath26 are represented by the width of the curve .",
    "hence the interpretability is currently limited by the normalization of the curve at the @xmath6 pole , which is arguably as small as @xmath49 .",
    "note the shift of @xmath50 at low @xmath34 with respect to the @xmath6 pole best fit value of @xmath51 .",
    "there have been reported several low energy measurements of the value of @xmath26 .",
    "the first one is from an atomic parity violation measurement in cesium [ 17 ] , which agrees with the standard model prediction within @xmath52 after many refinements detailing the atomic structure of cesium were introduced .",
    "the second one is from a measurement of parity violating mller scattering [ 18 ] , which also agrees with the standard model prediction within approximately @xmath52 .",
    "this is at present the better measurement in constraining extensions of the standard model .",
    "the third one is from a measurement of neutrino and antineutrino scattering from iron [ 19 ] with a roughly @xmath48 deviation from the standard model prediction . for this result",
    "there remain various uncertainties in the theoretical corrections that need to be applied ( among other two distinct effects of charge symmetry breaking in the quark distributions of the nucleons [ 20 ] ) .",
    "it is quite apparent that much higher precision experiments are needed in order to search for possible extensions of the standard model .",
    "one of these is a precision measurement of the weak charge of the proton , @xmath53 , currently being prepared for execution starting in 2009 in hall c of jefferson laboratory [ 21 ] .",
    "the extraction of the value of @xmath26 is free of many - body theoretical uncertainties and has the virtue of being able to reach much higher precision ( note that at a @xmath34 value of @xmath54 , @xmath55 equals 0.07 giving a large boost in the precision that may be obtained )",
    ". the dominant hydronic effects that must be accounted for in extracting @xmath56 from the measured analyzing power are contained in form factor contributions which are sufficiently constrained from the recent programs of parity violating electron scattering ( at mit - bates , jlab , and mami ) without reliance on theoretical nucleon structure calculations , with the exception possibly of very small two - photon exchange contributions ) .",
    "the standard model evolution of @xmath26 corresponds to a 10 standard deviation effect in the planned qweak experiment at jlab .",
    "the qweak experiment , the first ever precision measurement of the weak charge of the proton and more precise than the existing low energy measurements , is crucial in testing the standard model .",
    "the black points with @xmath52 error bars show the existing experimental values , while the red points with error bars refer to the 4% @xmath56 measurement in preparation and a 2.5% @xmath57  gev mller measurement under consideration . ]    in the qweak experiment the weak charge of the proton , @xmath53 , will be deduced from the parity violating analyzing power , defined as : @xmath58/[n^{+ } + n^{- } ]     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where p is the polarization of the longitudinally polarized electron beam and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the normalized scattering yields .",
    "it was shown in [ 22 ] that for forward angle scattering , where @xmath59 , the analyzing power can be written : @xmath60     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 denotes the fermi coupling constant and @xmath36 is the fine structure constant .",
    "one should note the dependence on @xmath61 , which requires precision polarimetry , and the dependence on the average value of @xmath34 over the finite acceptance of the magnetic spectrometer based detector system for scattered electrons , which requires the averaged value to be determined through specific ancillary control measurements .",
    "the leading term in the equation is the weak charge of the proton , @xmath53 .",
    "the quantity @xmath62 represents the finite size nucleon structure and contains the proton and neutron electromagnetic and weak form factors .",
    "the value of @xmath62 can be determined experimentally by extrapolation from the ongoing program of forward angle parity violating electron scattering experiments at higher values of @xmath34 , discussed above , or by specific control measurements .",
    "the incident energy and the four - momentum transfer value ( mean scattering angle ) followed from careful considerations of the figure of merit .",
    "the optimum values are an incident energy of 1.165  gev and a four - momentum transfer of @xmath54 .",
    "one can then write for the longitudinal analyzing power : @xmath63 where the hadronic structure contributions are separated in vector and axial vector components .",
    "clearly , the analyzing power is very small @xmath64 and one must arrive at an overall uncertainty of 2% to meet the precision objective of 0.3% in @xmath26 . consequently , high statistics data are a prerequisite requiring high luminosity and high beam polarization , and an integrating low - noise detector system of large acceptance . as indicated above , the longitudinal beam polarization must be precisely known as well as the hadronic structure contribution @xmath62 to be subtracted from the measured analyzing power @xmath65 the qweak experiment requires 2200 hours of data taking of the longitudinal analyzing power @xmath29 in elastic electron proton scattering at a momentum transfer of @xmath54 with 180 @xmath3a of 85% polarized beam incident on a 0.35  m long lh@xmath66 target to determine @xmath26 at the 0.03% level at low @xmath34 .",
    "a layout of the qweak experiment is given in fig .",
    "the qweak experiment is complementary to a parity violating electron - electron scattering experiment , under consideration to be performed at 11  gev with an upgraded cebaf at jlab , with an envisaged precision in @xmath26 equal to or better than that from any individual measurement at the @xmath6 pole .",
    "this implies a considerable reduction in the error of the slac mller experiment .",
    "needless to state : the electroweak radiative corrections to a pure leptonic measurement are more contained .",
    "in the search for physics beyond the standard model , precision measurements of the weak charge of the proton and of the weak charge of the electron are rather complementary .",
