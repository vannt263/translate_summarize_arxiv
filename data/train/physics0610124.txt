    "the photorefractive effect leads to a variety of nonlinear optical phenomena in certain types of crystals .",
    "the basic mechanism of the effect is the excitation and redistribution of charge carriers inside a crystal as a result of non - uniform illumination .",
    "the redistributed charges give rise to a non - uniform internal electric field and thus to spatial variations in the refractive index of the crystal through the pockels effect .",
    "significant nonlinearity can be induced by relatively weak ( @xmath0 ) laser radiation .",
    "phenomena such as self - focusing , energy coupling between two coherent laser beams , self - pumped phase conjugation , chaos , pattern formation and spatial soliton have attracted much attention in the past 20 years @xcite .    among photorefractive crystals ,",
    "semiconductor materials have attractive properties for applications in optical telecommunications such as optical switching and routing .",
    "this is due to the fact that they are sensitive in the infrared region and their response time can be fast ( @xmath1)@xcite . +",
    "two - wave - mixing is an excellent tool to characterize the photorefractive effect in these materials @xcite by determining the gain of amplification under the influence of the applied field , impurity densities , or grating period .",
    "some semiconductors , like inp : fe , exhibit an intensity dependant resonance at stabilized temperatures @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze the temperature dependance of two - wave - mixing ( twm ) characteristic time constant , theoretically at first and eventually against experimental results . we propose a formal description of the temporal evolution of carrier densities in the medium , linking them to the twm gain temporal evolution .",
    "the basic principles of the photorefractive effect in inp : fe are well known @xcite .",
    "it involves three steps : photoexcitation of trapped carriers into excited states , migration of excited carriers preferentially towards non - illuminated regions and capture into empty deep centers .",
    "this leads to the formation of a local space - charge field @xmath3 and thus to the modulation of the refractive index .",
    "the modulated refraction index is then able to interact with the beams that have created it .",
    "when the modulation stems from beam interference as in two wave mixing , an energy transfer between beams may occur .",
    "the principle of two - wave - mixing is to propagate simultaneously in a photorefractive crystal two coherent beams , which have an angle @xmath4 between their directions of propagation .",
    "this phenomena is governed by the following system of coupled nonlinear differential equations : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pump intensity , @xmath7 is the signal intensity , and @xmath8 is the total intensity equal to the sum @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the absorption coefficient ( assumed here to be the same for pump and signal ) . in a photorefractive crystal , @xmath11 takes the following form @xcite : @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the refractive index , @xmath14 is the effective electro - optic coefficient , @xmath15 is the beam wavelength in vacuum and @xmath16 is the imaginary part of the space - charge field @xmath3(the @xmath17 shifted component of @xmath3 with respect to the illumination grating ) .",
    "the expression of @xmath3 will derived in the following lines .",
    "@xmath4 is the angle between the two beams . in order to evaluate the photorefractive gain @xmath18 given by equation ( [ gequa ] )",
    ", the space - charge field @xmath3 has to be calculated from the modified kukhtarev model @xcite , taking into account both electrons and holes as charge carriers .",
    "we chose a model with one deep center donor , two types of carriers ( electrons and holes)@xcite , considering variations only in one transversal dimension ( x ) as described by the following set of equations :    [ systeme ] @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the electric field , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the electron and hole densities in the respective conduction and valence bands , @xmath23 is the density of ionized occupied traps , @xmath24 is the density of neutral unoccupied traps , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the electron and hole currents .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the densities of iron atoms , the shallow donors and the shallow acceptors .",
    "the charge mobilities are given by @xmath30 for electrons and @xmath31 for holes , the electron and hole recombination rate are respectively @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the temperature and @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the dielectric permittivity is given by @xmath36 while @xmath37 is the charge of the electron .",
    "@xmath38 is the voltage applied externally to the crystal of width @xmath39 .",
    "the electron and hole emission parameters are @xmath40 and @xmath41 depend on both thermal and optical emission as described by:@xmath42 where the thermal contribution to the emission rate coefficient is @xmath43 and the optical cross section of the carriers is given by @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the spatially dependent intensity of light due to the interferences between pump and signal beams and @xmath46 is the photon energy .    for sufficiently small modulation depth @xmath47 , intensity and all carriers densities may be expanded into fourier series interrupted after the first term : @xmath48 where @xmath49 takes the role of @xmath50 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 the spatial frequency of the interference pattern .",
    "so the light intensity can be written for the average intensity @xmath8 as :    @xmath54    in the following , we have calculated the temporal evolution of carriers density and we will look forward to finding the temporal evolution of the space charge field under these hypothesis , i.e. considering only the zeroth and first order of the fourier expansion .",
    "the zeroth order corresponds to an uniform illumination ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the space charge field is thus equal to zero and the local field is uniform and equals the applied field @xmath56 .",
    "the electrons and holes densities at steady state are known to be equal to @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively @xcite , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the density of occupied and unoccupied traps at steady state .    , @xmath61 , t=297k .",
    "materials parameters taken from ref @xcite are :  @xmath62 ,  @xmath63 ,  @xmath64 ,  @xmath65 ,   @xmath66 ,  @xmath67 ,  @xmath68 ,  @xmath69 ,  @xmath70 ,  @xmath71 .,width=302 ]    the electrons and holes densities in transient regime when an uniform illumination is established , are calculated by solving equations ( [ ndt ] ) and ( [ pdt ] ) , assuming that @xmath72 for @xmath73 and at time @xmath74 , the carriers density values are equal to @xmath75 and @xmath76 at thermal equilibrium , without any optical excitations @xcite .",
    "we obtained the following solution :    @xmath77    the temporal evolution of carrier densities under uniform illumination is illustrated in figure [ ordrezeroelectron ] .",
    "our model confirms the fact that the carrier densities evolution grows exponentially .",
    "the rise time of carriers generation is on the order of nanosecond time scale for a beam intensity of a few  per . without presence of the beam ,",
    "the electron density is greater than the hole density because electrons are mostly generated thermally while holes are generated optically @xcite .    for a modulated intensity ( first fourier order ) , by using the set of equations ( [ systeme ] )",
    ", the space - charge field can be approximatively expressed at steady state as @xcite : @xmath78 + where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the space charge field under uniform illumination , the diffusion field and charge - limiting field respectively .",
    "@xmath82 is the resonance intensity defined as the intensity at which holes and electrons are generated at the same rate .    from equation ( [ esta ] ) ,",
    "we observe that the space charge field is purely imaginary , when the illumination @xmath8 equals @xmath83 . above resonance ,",
    "the hole density is higher than the electron one , mainly because the holes cross section is stronger than for electrons .",
    "the result is that charge transfer mainly occurs between iron level and the valence band . below resonance , when electrons are dominant , the iron mainly interacts with the electrons and the conduction band . + in transient regime for a modulated intensity , the dynamics of the space charge field is calculated by considering an adiabatic approximations @xcite , a concentration of electrons and holes densities reaches instantaneously the equilibrium value which depends on the actual concentration of filled and empty traps , so we set : @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that the electrons are excited thermally while the holes optically @xcite . in the low modulation approximation , some algebraic manipulations of the set of equations ( [ systeme ] ) lead to :    @xmath85\\label{e1temp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 is a complex time constant , which can be rewritten by separating its real and imaginary parts .",
    "@xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89    the subscript indexes @xmath13 and @xmath90 are related to the electron and hole contributions respectively . @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "are given by : @xmath93    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the mobility field , @xmath96 is the electron dielectric relaxation time depending on intensity and temperature which can be written as : @xmath97 @xmath98 is the thermal parameter equal to : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the effective masse of electron , @xmath101 is the apparent activation energy of the electron trap , @xmath102 is the electron capture cross section .",
    "the value of this parameters are determined experimentally @xcite . + to obtain @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the index @xmath90 should be substituted for the index @xmath13 in the equations ( [ to ] ) , ( [ www ] ) and ( [ dodo ] ) . + from equations ( [ e1temp ] ) to ( [ toutou ] ) , it is possible to deduce , as was done previously @xcite , that the time constant @xmath86 is real if electron emission is equal to the hole emission . that is , in the case of inp : fe , electron thermal - emission is equal to the holes optical - emission .",
    "this allows to infer a link between the behavior of inp : fe as a function of intensity and temperature .",
    "+ it will be the aim of the following sections to confirm this link , both theoretically and experimentally",
    "the photorefractive gain @xmath11 is the main parameter that can be determined by two - wave - mixing .",
    "it quantifies an energy transfer from the pump beam to the signal beam and is proportional to the imaginary part of the space - charge field .",
    "the gain value depends on different parameters like applied electric field , iron density @xmath27 , pump intensity and temperature @xcite .",
    "our work concentrate on the study of the gain dynamics versus temperature and we particularly analyze the dependance of the rise time on temperature .",
    "the stationary value of the photorefractive gain at different temperatures is given by equation ( [ gequa ] ) where @xmath3 is given by equation ( [ esta ] ) .",
    "this expression shows that a maximum gain is reached when @xmath106 .",
    "this maximum corresponds to an intensity resonance @xcite .",
    "we studied theoretically the temporal gain behavior using the standard definition given by equation ( [ gaist ] ) deduced from equation ( [ e1temp ] ) by developing @xmath3 and @xmath86 .",

    "we see that the gain amplitude differs from each intensity to another , it takes the maximum value around resonance .    as a next step",
    ", we studied theoretically the twm gain time response as a function of temperature . for an easier comparison with experimental results , in the following",
    ", the response time is @xmath118 will be considered as the time interval necessary for the gain to reach @xmath119 of the first maximum of each curves as shown in figure [ gaintempintes ] .",
    "the response time @xmath118 versus temperature are given in figure [ tempeires ] for three distinct intensities , along with a fourth fitted curve showing the time constant at resonance intensities .",
    "we observe that the response time quickly decays as temperature increases . at resonance , @xmath118 is larger because the space charge field is high and it consequently necessitates more charge to accumulate .",
    "the theoretical curve shown in figure [ gaintempintes ] , illustrates the temporal evolution of the local gain . for the inp : fe sample , the absorption coefficient at @xmath120 being approximately equal to @xmath121 . owing to this absorption , the mean intensity decrease along the @xmath122 axis propagation . the exponential gain would result from an integration over the optical thickness , as described in equation [ average ] .",

    "as for the local gain , we calculated numerically the characteristic time , in the same way .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ tempeires1 ] .",
    "we compare the results in figure [ tempeires ] , we observe the following differences : the resonance peaks are slightly widened because is reached within the example for various input intensities and the peaks are shifted towards high intensities again because of absorption .",
    "these conclusions can arise from figures [ tempeires ] and [ tempeires1 ] although they show the rise time as a function of temperature .",
    "indeed , our calculations show that the photorefractive gain and rise time are linked , so that the rise time is the slowest for the highest gain ( i.e. at resonance ) ; since more charges need to be accumulated .",
