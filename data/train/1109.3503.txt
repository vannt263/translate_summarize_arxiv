    "although extremely successful , the standard model ( sm ) of particles and fields is not sufficient for solving many open physics problems including the source of the dark matter , the incorporation of gravity , and the hierarchy problem between the weak and planck scales .",
    "one theory that addresses the hierarchy problem is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) graviton model @xcite .",
    "the rs model solves the hierarchy problem by introducing an extra compact dimension accessible only to gravity .",
    "the phenomenology leads to a small number of distinct kaluza - klein states ( spin-2 gravitons ) that couple with gravitational - strength to sm particles and can be detected as resonances of pairs of jets , leptons , photons , or @xmath3 bosons .",
    "given the considerable dijet background in a hadron - collider environment , and the low leptonic branching fraction of the weak bosons , the prompt dilepton and diphoton final states offer the greatest sensitivity at the tevatron .",
    "we present here the recent cdf searches for rs - gravitons decaying to diphotons , dielectrons , or dimuons .",
    "for the 5.4 fb@xmath0 diphoton search @xcite a combination of two diphoton ( @xmath4 gev ) and two single - photon ( @xmath5 gev ) triggers is used .",
    "the two photon candidates are required to be central and fiducial in the detector , have @xmath6 gev and excess energy around a cone of @xmath7 less than 2 gev .",
    "the expected number of rs graviton events , as a function of graviton mass , is estimated using the pythia @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) event generator , with cteq5l @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , and processed by the geant - based @xcite cdf ii detector simulation .",
    "the main sm diphoton background to the graviton signal is the @xmath8 production , determined using diphox @xcite next - to - leading order ( nlo ) mc event generator , with acceptance corrected using a pythia sm diphoton sample passing the cdf detector simulation , and with the high - mass spectrum extrapolated .",
    "a secondary background comes from jet+@xmath9 or dijet events where one or two jets are misidentified as photons ( fake - photon background ) .",
    "this background is determined with the construction of a cdf `` fake diphoton '' sample with looser photon identification requirements , to allow for jet contamination .",
    "subsequently , the actual cdf diphoton spectrum is fitted to this `` fake diphoton '' shape along with the mc - estimated sm diphoton spectrum , with both components varying in the fit .",
    "systematic uncertainties arise from the luminosity determination ( 6% ) , the initial and final radiation ( 4 - 8% ) , and the @xmath10 and pdf uncertainties ( 20% ) in the diphox calculation .",
    "figure [ rsspectrum_gg ] shows the observed diphoton mass spectrum with the total background overlaid . in the region",
    "around 200 gev/@xmath11 there is an excess of events , with a local probability of such a fluctuation of 1.3% .",
    "this is consistent with the 1-sigma spread of minimal probabilities in the range of 150 - 650 gev/@xmath11 , as determined with pseudoexperiments .",
    "cdf completed searches for the rs - gravitons in the dielectron @xcite and dimuon @xcite channels using 5.7 fb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity .",
    "single - lepton triggers requiring an electron or muon with transverse momentum @xmath12",
    "gev/@xmath13 are used , in addition to a trigger that remains efficient for @xmath14  gev/@xmath13 electrons .",
    "offline two electrons ( muons ) are selected , at least one with energy ( @xmath15 ) above 20 gev ( gev@xmath16 ) .",
    "the leptons come from the same primary vertex and are isolated , i.e. , the excess energy in a cone @xmath17 around each lepton is less than 10% of the energy ( momentum ) of the electron ( muon ) .",
    "cosmic veto and photon - conversion removal are applied ; no opposite charge is enforced .",
    "main sm dilepton background to the rs - graviton dilepton signal is the drell - yan ( dy ) process @xmath18 .",
    "significant background comes from qcd - originated events of one real lepton and one `` fake '' lepton , i.e. , jet ( track ) faking an electron ( muon ) .",
    "minor backgrounds come from diboson ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 processses with subsequent leptonic decays .",
    "the qcd background is determined with cdf data , with the application of a probability that a jet ( track ) fakes an electron ( muon ) on events with one identified lepton .",
    "this probability is a function of the jet s ( track s ) transverse momentum and is determined by counting reconstructed electrons and muons in a jet - rich cdf data , which is characterized by minimal leptonic content .",
    "all other backgrounds are estimated with mc simulations ( pythia - generated events using cteq5l pdf , processed by the cdf detector simulator ) abosolutely normalized to the theoretical next - to - leading order cross sections , data luminosity , lepton - id scale factors and trigger efficiencies .",
    "the main sources of systematic uncertainty on the mc - estimated backgrounds are the theoretical cross sections ( an 8% effect on the event yields ) , the luminosity ( 6% ) , the lepton - id efficiency ( 2% ) , the parton distribution functions ( 2% ) , and the trigger efficiency ( 0.5% ) .",
    "the total mc systematic uncertainty on the expected event yield is @xmath24% .",
    "the respective qcd - background systematic uncertainty is @xmath25% , which comes from the variation in the measurement of the fake probabilities using different jet - rich cdf datasets triggered with varied jet - energy thresholds .",
    "the dielectron and dimuon mass spectra are consistent with expectation , as can be seen in figure [ rsspectrum_ll ] . at the same time , the highest - dielectron - mass event ever observed at the time was detected ( @xmath26 gev/@xmath11 ) . in this event ,",
    "the two electrons have transverse momenta of 482 and 468  gev/@xmath13 and are oppositely charged .",
    "the event is characterized by very low hadronic activity ( no jets are reconstructed ) and by a low missing transverse energy of 17  gev  separated by 23 degrees in @xmath27 from the 468  gev/@xmath13 electron  coming most probably from the resolution of the calorimeter . the probability that at least one event is observed with a mass at least",
    "that high is 4% .",
    "this probability is within the 1-sigma range of minimal probabilities observed anywhere in the dilepton spectrum , as determined by pseudoexperiments .    ]    ]",
    "[ rslimit ] ]    the measured diphoton and dilepton spectra can be used to set a limit on rs - graviton production @xcite . here",
    "we parametrize the rs model using the mass of the lightest rs graviton ( @xmath28 ) and the dimensionless parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the curvature scale of the extra dimension and @xmath31 is the planck mass .",
    "rs - graviton signal mc events are generated using pythia and values of @xmath28 from 200 to 1100  gev/@xmath11 .",
    "the signal - mc events are generated and normalized in the same manner as the background - mc events .",
    "the leading - order pythia cross section is multiplied by a scale ( `` @xmath32-factor '' ) to correct for next - to - leading - order effects @xcite .",
    "figure [ rslimit ] shows the combined 95% cl cross - section ( @xmath33 ) upper limit as a function of @xmath28 along with five theoretical cross - section curves for @xmath34 to 0.1 , a theoretically interesting range that would provide a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "the limits are set using a frequentist method that compares the background - only with the signal+background hypotheses , taking into account correlated background systematic uncertainties across the channels @xcite .",
    "the intersection of the cross - section exclusion limit with the theoretical cross - section curves gives the 95% cl lower limit on @xmath28 for the respective coupling .",
    "for @xmath1 , the @xmath28 lower limit is 1111  gev/@xmath11 , if we use proper mass - dependent rs - graviton @xmath32-factors , and 1141  gev/@xmath11 assuming a fixed @xmath32-factor of 1.54 , for comparisons with previous tevatron results . for @xmath35  tev/@xmath11 ,",
    "cross sections greater than 0.6 fb are excluded at the 95% cl . at the time of release ,",
