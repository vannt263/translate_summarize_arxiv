    "let @xmath11 be the fatou component containing @xmath4 .",
    "then there exists a ball @xmath237 centered at @xmath4 contained in @xmath238 . by definition of @xmath0",
    ", @xmath239 is an infinitely connected unbounded subset of the fatou set .",
    "this means that there is a single fatou component , say @xmath12 such that @xmath240 .",
    "clearly @xmath12 is unbounded . if @xmath12 is the only fatou component of @xmath1 we are done .",
    "note that @xmath241 in this case .",
    "otherwise , there is a fatou component @xmath151 different from @xmath12 .",
    "the proof will be complete by showing that @xmath151 is bounded .",
    "the fatou component @xmath242 containing @xmath243 is clearly different from @xmath11 .",
    "now , it follows from lemma  [ bovnotinball ] that each component of @xmath244 is bounded .",
    "in particular , @xmath151 is bounded .",
    "if @xmath11 is a completely invariant fatou component of @xmath1 then @xmath11 is unbounded and this is the only unbounded fatou component of @xmath1 by ( 1 ) of this lemma .",
    "it follows from the definition of @xmath0 that there exists @xmath19 such that @xmath239 is an unbounded subset of the fatou set in such a way that it intersects @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath245 and consequently @xmath246 since @xmath11 is completely invariant .",
    "therefore @xmath247 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath248 and consider a ball @xmath249 contained in @xmath250 .",
    "then @xmath239 is a connected and unbounded subset of the fatou set .",
    "since @xmath12 is the only unbounded fatou component , it contains @xmath239 giving that @xmath251 .",
    "we know that @xmath1 is continuous on @xmath12 which gives that @xmath252 is connected . since @xmath12 is backward invariant , we can choose a @xmath253 such that @xmath254 . then @xmath255 .",
    "this implies @xmath12 is the fatou component containing @xmath252 .",
    "therefore @xmath12 is forward invariant .",
    "hence v is completely invariant .",
    "it is a conjecture that the number of completely invariant fatou components of a meromorphic function is at most two .",
    "this has already been proved for rational functions , transcendental entire functions and transcendental meromorphic functions of finite type .",
    "theorem @xmath256",
    "@xcite states that if @xmath1 is a transcendental meromorphic function with a single omitted value and @xmath1 has at least one critical value then the number of completely invariant fatou components is at most two .",
    "the following result confirms a stronger version of the conjecture if the omitted values is a @xmath0 . in the following theorem ,",
    "let @xmath257 and @xmath258 denote the sets of all critical values and omitted values of @xmath1 respectively .",
    "if @xmath160 has @xmath0 then the number of completely invariant fatou components is at most one .",
    "[ onecifc ]    let @xmath4 be the @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",
    "if there exists two completely invariant fatou components of @xmath1 , say @xmath259 and @xmath260 then each is simply connected @xcite and unbounded .",
    "suppose @xmath1 has a critical value .",
    "then either @xmath261 or @xmath262 by lemma 5 of  @xcite . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath262 .",
    "so the @xmath0 @xmath4 is in @xmath259 . by lemma  [ bovinfatouset](1 )",
    ", there exists a unique unbounded fatou component .",
    "this is a contradiction as there are two unbounded fatou components .",
    "suppose @xmath1 has no critical value . since @xmath4 is the @xmath0 , it is the only asymptotic value of @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath1 is of finite type and it has no baker domains or wandering domains . since @xmath263 and @xmath264 are completely invariant , none of them is either a herman ring or a siegel disk .",
    "thus @xmath265 is an attracting or a parabolic domain and contains at least one singular value . but @xmath4 is the only singular value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is a contradiction and it is proved that the number of completely invariant fatou components is at most one .    from some earlier work of nayak and zheng ,",
    "a sufficient condition for non existence of completely invariant fatou components follows .",
    "let @xmath160 have @xmath0 @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath266 and @xmath267 is bounded then @xmath1 has no completely invariant fatou component .",
    "if the julia component @xmath268 containing @xmath4 is singleton then the claim follows from corollary 1 ( i ) of  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath268 is not singleton then there is a multiply connected fatou component which must be a herman ring by theorem 1  @xcite .",
    "but a herman ring implies non existence of completely invariant fatou component .",
    "we put forth some questions arising out of this article .",
    "theorem  [ bwdbov ] proves that if an entire function has a baker wandering domain then it has @xmath0 . that the converse is not true in general",
    "was exhibited by example  [ example3 ] . in this context",
    "the following makes sense .",
    "characterize all entire functions for which existence of @xmath0 implies the existence of baker wandering domain .    in view of corollary  [ singletonnonburied ]",
    ", the following question remains unanswered .",
    "let @xmath160 have a single omitted value @xmath4 , @xmath226 is singleton and buried .",
    "is it true that @xmath4 is @xmath0 of @xmath1 ?",
    "if an omitted value of a function is a pole then it has no herman ring .",
    "also , if all the poles of a function having an omitted value are multiple , then it has no herman ring .",
    "if a meromorphic function has an omitted value , then it has no herman ring of period one and two .",
    "all these are proved in @xcite and are true for functions with @xmath0 .",
    "we incline to make the following conjecture .",
    "meromorphic functions with @xmath0 have no herman ring .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ oneav ] that a function with @xmath0 has no asymptotic value other than the @xmath0 .",
