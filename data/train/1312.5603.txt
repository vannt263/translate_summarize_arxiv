    "non - planar feynman diagrams arise naturally from perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "they are interesting for many reasons .",
    "first of all , from the graph - theoretical point of view many constructions and theorems are formulated only for planar graphs .",
    "formally , any feynman diagram @xmath0 can be considered as a graph and thus subjected to graph - theoretical methods . moreover , labelling all edges of @xmath0 by momenta makes @xmath0 a network flow , and which is not necessarily unique .",
    "consequently , it can make some redundant problems on the way to find effective analytical or numerical solutions to a given feynman diagram .",
    "this is especially true if we want to make general programs which use some methods to solve feynman integrals .",
    "we focus here on one technical aspect . given a feynman diagram @xmath0 ,",
    "is it possible to decide the planarity of @xmath0 only upon its propagators ?",
    "the question could be rewritten in a more general way : is it possible to decide the planarity of a network flow only upon its flows ?",
    "the answer is important considering e.g. computer algebra methods in particle physics .",
    "we faced the problem when working on the upgrade of ` ambre ` package @xcite , where different methods are applied in order to construct an optimal , low - dimensional mellin ",
    "barnes representation of @xmath0 depending on its planarity ( work in progress ) .",
    "the problem of planarity identification of @xmath0 upon its propagators has been mentioned lately also in @xcite . in general , the available graph - theoretical methods to recognize planarity of a graph rely mainly on its geometry , like the kuratowski theorem , that claims that a graph @xmath0 is planar iff it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of @xmath1 or @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "when no geometry of @xmath0 is given , it is hard to decide about subgraphs of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the case of ` ambre ` , where only propagators are given . as we will show",
    ", the answer for the question is positive .",
    "another interesting property of non - planar feynman diagrams is that they are not dealt with twistor methods , originally applied only to planar sector of @xmath3 sym @xcite .",
    "the question whether it is possible to apply these methods to the non - planar sector remains open .",
    "the main obstacle is the lack of duals for non - planar diagrams , hence lack of dual variables , on which these methods rely . on the other hand , in the so - called t hooft limit of @xmath4 with coupling @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , only planar diagrams survive .",
    "thus one could argue that ( non-)planarity is not of purely technical , graph theoretical character , but rather it is a significant ingredient with a physical interpretation in the above limit .",
    "let us start with some definitions .",
    "a graph is _ planar _ if it can be drawn on a surface ( sphere ) without intersections .",
    "non - planar _ graph is a graph that is not planar .",
    "a _ dual _ to a graph is constructed by drawing vertices inside the faces ( including the external face ) and connecting vertices that correspond to adjacent faces ( fig .",
    "[ du1 ] ) .",
    "such duals can be defined only for planar graphs .",
    "to say that a feynman diagram @xmath0 is ( non-)planar , one defines the _ adjoint _ diagram @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ adj ] ) .",
    "it is constructed from @xmath0 by attaching all external lines to an auxiliary vertex @xcite .",
    "we say that a feynman diagram @xmath0 is planar iff @xmath8 is planar .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected @xmath9loop feynman diagram , @xmath10 be the set of external momenta , @xmath11 be the set of edges in @xmath0 ( neglecting external lines ) , @xmath12 be the set of corresponding momentum flows in @xmath0 and @xmath13 be the set of vertices in @xmath0",
    ". then there holds @xcite @xmath14 hence given the number of edges ( flows ) and loops , the number of vertices @xmath15 can be derived from ( [ eqn : ver ] ) . after introducing feynman parameters @xmath16 ,",
    "one defines the laplacian matrix @xmath17 of a graph @xmath0 as a @xmath18 matrix with entries @xmath19 elements of @xmath17 are calculated in a few steps .",
    "diagonal elements @xmath20 are obtained by deciding which feynman parameters @xmath21 are attached to @xmath22 .",
    "vertices are divided into external ( attached to external lines ) and internal ones .",
    "note that only triple and quartic ( i.e. of degree 3 and 4 ) vertices are allowed.ary vertices , the method ii is a better approach .",
    "] thus the conditions are of the form @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the flows that fulfill the above relations contribute to diagonal elements of @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , off - diagonal elements @xmath27 are obtained by deciding feynman parameters @xmath21 that connect vertices @xmath22 , @xmath28 .",
    "observe that such @xmath21 s have to be both in @xmath20 and @xmath29 , thus the intersection of elements in @xmath20 and @xmath29 is non - empty and gives exactly these @xmath21 s . in the case of many edges connecting @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath28 , they shrink to one edge , thus giving exactly one @xmath21 ( hence @xmath30 ) .",
    "+ in order to obtain a more familiar form of @xmath17 , understandable to ` mathematica ` software @xcite , redefine @xmath17 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the degree of @xmath22 .",
    "the above definition is derived from ( [ eqn : l1 ] ) by substituting @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath17 can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a degree matrix and @xmath36 is the adjacency matrix given by @xmath37 the final part of the algorithm is to create the adjoint diagram @xmath8 .",
    "is the same as @xmath0 by definition . ] the laplacian matrix @xmath38 of @xmath8 is build upon @xmath17 by extending it by one row and one column corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "clearly @xmath40 and extra 1 s appear in the @xmath41 column and @xmath41 row at the elements corresponding to external vertices .",
    "thus , from ( [ eqn : adj ] ) the adjacency matrix @xmath42 is obtained . eventually , given @xmath43 , the function ` planarq ` of the ` mathematica ` package ` combinatorica ` yields the answer for the question of planarity of a feynman diagram @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , in @xcite there was made a remark that it is possible to draw a diagram upon the set of denominators .",
    "in fact , given the matrix @xmath43 it is possible to draw a given diagram with ` mathematica ` by using the function ` adjacencygraph ` .",
    "instructive examples for planarity recognition using the described algorithm are given in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected @xmath9loop feynman diagram , @xmath10 be the set of external momenta , @xmath12 be the set of corresponding momentum flows in @xmath0 .",
    "_ dual variables _",
    "@xmath44 are defined by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath45 then by introducing rules of the form @xmath46 all momenta are substituted by dual variables and one obtains the following criterion : a feynman diagram is planar iff it is possible to write all propagators ( including external momenta ) in the form @xmath47 .",
    "let us present two examples .    1 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple box diagram with four external lines @xmath48 and a loop momentum @xmath49 .",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the integral @xmath50 introduce dual variables according to ( [ eqn : dual ] ) .",
    "+    + note that external momenta correspond to crossing of external lines and lines between corresponding dual variables ( fig .",
    "[ adj1 ] ) .",
    "the integral is now of the form @xmath51 observe that substitution @xmath52 gives a conformal invariant object @xmath53 2 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a non - planar double box with @xmath54 and introduce dual variables again ( fig .",
    "+    + obviously , since the diagram is non - planar , it does not have a dual .",
    "note that after transforming momenta to dual variables , one of the possible forms of the integral is + @xmath55    non - planarity is encoded in the element @xmath56 , that breaks the conformal invariance .",
    "thus there is a strict correspondence between dual diagrams and dual variables , hence another planarity criterion for feynman diagrams is established .",
    "instructive examples for planarity recognition using described algorithm are given in @xcite .",
    "observe that it is possible to planarize a non - planar diagram by embedding it on a surface with genus higher than 0 .",
    "actually , the minimal genus of a surface where the given diagram @xmath0 is planar is called the _ genus _ of @xmath0 .",
    "let us give an example .",
    "let a three - loop non - planar self - energy be embedded on a torus .",
    "then there is no crossing of diagram lines , hence the diagram is planar on the torus ( fig . [ tor ] ) .",
    "it is then possible to find its dual diagram and corresponding dual variables .",
    "unfortunately , such an embedding sets the number of faces too small to give a proper interpretation of momenta by dual variables .",
    "it can be easily calculated by euler s formula that @xmath57 where @xmath58  euler characteristics , @xmath59  number of vertices , @xmath60  number of edges , @xmath61  number of faces ( dual variables ) , @xmath5  genus of a graph ( surface ) .",
    "thus there are only three dual variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 available , in contrast to five momenta @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "hence , although the non - planar diagram is planarized , it is not possible to define appropriate dual variables , since two momenta are absorbed by torus generators .",
