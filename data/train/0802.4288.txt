    "in recent years , the evolution of massive galaxies in the universe has received much attention because of the possible tension between observations of the abundance and clustering of such galaxies , as a function of redshift , and predictions from popular hierarchical models of galaxy evolution .",
    "naively , in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universe , one would expect the most massive galaxies to form last through the hierarchical merging of smaller galaxies .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in the recent high resolution simulations of @xcite , which include the latest semi  analytical formalism and account for feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . in these simulations ,",
    "the stars in the most massive galaxies are formed at high redshifts , but their stellar mass is only assembled into a single system at relatively late times through  dry mergers \" , i.e. , major mergers of gas  poor galaxies with little or no associated star  formation .",
    "for example , in figures 4 and 5 of @xcite , the simulations shows that for low redshift elliptical galaxies , with masses @xmath14 , 80% of their stars are formed at a median redshift of @xmath15 , but 80% of the stellar mass is only put in place by @xmath16 .",
    "likewise , the simulations show that galaxies with masses @xmath14 have multiple large progenitors and can not be formed through a single major merger of two large galaxies .",
    "these recent agn  feedback models of galaxy evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) solve the apparent inconsistency of the old ages of stars in massive galaxies ( both in and outside galaxy clusters ) and the late assembly of such galaxies in a @xmath17dominated cdm universe .",
    "however , they appear to be in conflict with recent observations of the luminosity function and clustering of massive ellipticals as a function of redshift .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the lack of evolution of the luminosity function of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; as defined in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) put an upper limit on the amount of allowed evolution in these massive galaxies , i.e. , at least half of the lrgs at low redshift ( @xmath18 ) must already have been well assembled ( with more than half their stellar mass in place ) by @xmath19 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with other luminosity function studies .",
    "for example , @xcite used data from the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) and the spitzer irac shallow survey to show that",
    " @xmath20 of the stellar mass contained within today s @xmath21 red galaxies was already in place at @xmath22 \" .",
    "these observational constraints are barely consistent with the semi - analytical cdm simulations discussed above .",
    "the clustering of massive ellipticals provides an additional test of the models .",
    "@xcite argue that the small  scale clustering of lrgs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that lrg ",
    "lrg mergers ( i.e. a major merger of two equally massive systems ) were not important for the mass growth of lrgs below @xmath23 .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the lrg  galaxy cross ",
    "correlation function to study the small  scale clustering of lrgs at @xmath24 and concluded that lrgs grow in stellar mass at most by @xmath25 between @xmath26 ( or approximately half the age of the universe ) .",
    "@xcite interpretted the evolution in the clustering of luminous red galaxies in the ndwfs using the halo model - they argue that a third of all satellite galaxies ( in a halo ) disappear over the redshift range @xmath27 . since the satellite fraction in their models is of order 20% , only about 7% of the galaxies have merged .",
    "however , if these mergers increase the stellar mass of the central object , then this increase can be 25% or even larger .",
    "@xcite report rapid evolution in the stellar mass of red galaxies since @xmath28 .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is probably due to the differences in the luminosity distributions of the samples , as it is known in clusters that most of the evolution on the so  called  red sequence \" is at magnitudes fainter than @xmath29 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we expand our earlier study of the evolution of the lrg luminosity function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) to include an investigation of the two  point auto - correlation function of these galaxies .",
    "the key difference of this work to that in the literature is the combination of two large samples of lrgs from the sdss and the 2df  sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey @xcite . as in paper",
    "i , we are careful to ensure the colour selection of lrgs is consistent between these two surveys , thus allowing a study of this unique population of massive ellipticals across the redshift range of @xmath30 . in addition",
    ", this paper uses the halo model to understand the evolution of the clustering of galaxies and constrain the merger rates of lrgs .",
    "although the logic is similar to the @xcite analysis of ndwfs , our halo model is entirely analytic , rather than entirely simulation - based .",
    "our analysis is complementary to that of @xcite who study the redshift space correlation function of the 2slaq sample , binned in pair separation parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight , and fit both biasing and cosmological parameters to this data .",
    "@xcite conclude that  lrgs have a constant space density and their clustering evolves purely under gravity \" , which is consistent with the results of paper i. here we wish to test if this conclusion remains true under a more precise comparison of the evolution of the correlation function of lrgs where we accurately account for the changing definition of an lrg with redshift ..    in section [ sec : data ] , we describe the sdss and 2slaq data used in this paper , while in section [ sec : samp ] we provide details of the sample selection used to ensure a consistent definition of an lrg across the two samples . in section [ sec:2ptcalc ] , we present our measurements of the two  point correlation function in both real and redshift  space .",
    "section [ sec : halo ] presents a halo model analysis of our measurements and discuss constraining the merger rate in the halo model framework in section [ sec : hodmerge ] .",
    "we discuss our findings in the context of recent work in section [ sec : comp ] and conclude in section [ sec : discuss ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a flat @xmath17dominated cosmology with @xmath31 , @xmath32 km s@xmath33mpc@xmath13 , and @xmath34 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we present in this paper an analysis of galaxies taken from both the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the 2df  sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey .",
    "the sdss survey contains 2 main spectroscopic galaxy data sets : the main sample and the lrg sample .",
    "the main sample consists of all galaxies with a galactic extinction corrected petrosian _ r _ magnitude @xmath35 17.77 ; this results in a median redshift of @xmath36 0.1 @xcite .",
    "the lrg sample uses a series of colour and magnitude cuts with the aim of selecting lrgs out to _ z _ @xmath36 0.5 ( see eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 for details of this sample ) .",
    "here we only consider the cut i lrg sample , which has a magnitude limit @xmath35 19.2 and is designed to select a pseudo volume  limited sample of lrgs , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . at low redshift",
    "there is considerable overlap between the main and lrg samples .",
    "we select these two samples of galaxies from the sdss data release 5 @xcite .",
    "the 2slaq lrg survey was designed to extend the sdss lrg sample to @xmath39 .",
    "the lrgs were again selected with colour and magnitude cuts using the sdss imaging .",
    "spectra were obtained with the 2df spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "full details of the selection and observations are given in @xcite .",
    "the final lrg sample contains over 11000 lrg redshifts , covering 180 @xmath40 of sdss imaging data with over 90% of these galaxies within the redshift range @xmath41 .",
    "the targeted lrgs were split into three subsamples as detailed in @xcite , with the primary sample ( sample 8) accounting for two thirds of these .",
    "we only focus on sample 8 in this paper due to its high completeness and uniform selection",
    ". the overall success rate of obtaining redshifts from the 2df spectra for sample 8 lrgs is 95% , while the centers of the 2df fields were spaced by 1.2@xmath42 , resulting in an overall redshift completeness of sample 8 lrg targets of @xmath3675% across the whole survey area ( paper i ) .",
    "although the sdss magnitude system @xcite was designed to be on the ab scale @xcite , the final calibration has differences from the proposed values by a few percent .",
    "we have applied the corrections m@xmath43 = m@xmath44 $ ] for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 respectively ( eisenstein , priv .",
    "comm . ) . all magnitudes and colours presented throughout this paper",
    "are corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .",
    "different techniques were employed to select lrgs in the sdss and the 2slaq survey , resulting in intrinsic differences between the properties of the lrgs in each sample ( figure [ fig : sel ] ) . in particular , the magnitude dependent colour cut used in the sdss selection results in only the very reddest galaxies being included in the sdss lrg sample at fainter magnitudes . therefore , if we wish to make a meaningful comparison of the evolution of lrgs with redshift we must make additional colour and magnitude cuts to ensure that we exactly match the samples from the two surveys .",
    "following paper i , we assume that the evolution of the lrgs stellar populations can be approximated by simple passive ageing .",
    "we therefore use the same models as paper i to generate k+e corrections which are used to correct the observed magnitudes of each sample to a common frame .",
    "paper i demonstrated that these models do not perfectly describe the colour evolution of the lrgs because of inadequacies in the stellar population synthesis models . to minimize the magnitude of these corrections , paper i restricted their lrg samples to tight redshift ranges at approximately _",
    "z _ = 0.2 and _ z _ = 0.55 where the _ u , g _ and _ r _ filters approximately map onto the _ g , r _ and _ i _ filters respectively .",
    "these same redshift cuts are again applied to the samples used herein .    in this paper",
    "we take two approaches to matching the selection between these two redshifts . in the first we follow the procedure of paper i.",
    "we take all the sdss lrgs with 0.17 @xmath50 0.24 and k+e correct their magnitudes to both z=0.2 and z=0.55 .",
    "we then apply the sdss selection criteria using the _ z _ = 0.2 magnitudes and the 2slaq selection criteria using the _ z _ = 0.55 magnitudes .",
    "we then execute the same procedure on the 2slaq lrgs within 0.5 @xmath50 0.6 .",
    "we note that since the 2slaq selection is significantly bluer in the rest - frame than the sdss selection ; it is the application of sdss selection cuts that is removing the majority of the lrgs removed from each sample by this procedure .",
    "we will therefore describe these samples as the sdss selection matched samples .",
    "our second approach makes use of the main galaxy sample from the sdss rather than just the lrg sample , although there is considerable intersection over the redshift range we are considering here .",
    "we limit the main galaxies to 0.15 @xmath50 0.21 and then apply our k+e corrections to correct to both _ z _ = 0.2 and _ z _ = 0.55 . for the galaxies at",
    "_ z _ = 0.21 the @xmath51 = 17.77 magnitude limit of the main galaxy sample corresponds to m@xmath52 = -22.3 .",
    "m@xmath52 is calculated by determining the apparent magnitude the galaxy would have at _ z _ = 0.2 in the sdss @xmath47-band filter using our assumed k+e corrections , and is then converted to an absolute magnitude using the distance modulus without the use of any further k or evolutionary corrections .",
    "the m@xmath52 = -22.3 is only 0.3 magnitudes brighter than the limit of the 2slaq sample when k+e corrected to this redshift .",
    "since the main sample contains galaxies of all colours we can generate a sample matching the 2slaq selection and we only need limit the 2slaq sample by this m@xmath52 cut .",
    "there is , however , an additional complication .",
    "as shown in paper i the errors on the photometry at the faint magnitudes of 2slaq result in a large scatter of objects across the colour and magnitude selection boundaries . to mimic this effect we measure the magnitude error distributions of the 2slaq galaxies as a function of magnitude and modify the magnitudes of the sdss galaxies randomly following this error distribution .",
    "we then apply the 2slaq selection criteria to both samples k+e corrected to _ z _ = 0.55 along with a cut at m@xmath52 = -22.4 .",
    "this slightly brighter cut than the m@xmath52 = -22.3 limit allows the inclusion fainter galaxies which are being scattered into the selection region by the application of the 2slaq photometric errors mimicking the effect present in the 2slaq data",
    ". we will refer to these samples as the 2slaq selection matched samples .",
    "we are unable to account for the effect of the photometric errors on the selection in the sdss selected lrg sample as we do nt have galaxies in that sample which are fainter or bluer than the lrgs . in paper",
    "i we corrected the lf at _ z _ = 0.55 for this sample using a sub - region that had deeper photometry .",
    "we are unable to apply such a correction in this work since the significantly smaller area ( @xmath361/3 of the total ) of this sub - region would result in a very poor measurement of the clustering and render any correction highly unreliable .",
    "the smaller area was not a problem for the lf measurement since the region of the lf most affected was the faint end were the galaxies were most numerous .",
    "the correction was also only required for a subsection of the lf , which one could always choose to disregard , whereas it would affect the entire correlation function .",
    "for this reason , when making direct evolutionary comparisons between redshifts , we will focus on the 2slaq selection matched samples .",
    "table [ tab : samp ] gives the number of galaxies in each sample and figure [ fig : sel ] illustrates the difference between the two selection criteria .",
    ".[tab : samp ] the redshift range , selection and number of galaxies in each sample defined in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we fit for the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see equations  [ eq : ncen ] and  [ eq : nsat ] ) by minimising a @xmath56 defined as the sum of the squared difference between the predicted and measured @xmath57 and @xmath58 for a range of @xmath59 .",
    "we use @xmath58 rather than @xmath1 as the numerical inversion required to calculate @xmath1 increases the uncertainties and systematically reduces the slope in our power law fits .",
    "our fitting makes use of the full covariance matrices over 0.32 @xmath60 50 @xmath61 mpc .",
    "we exclude scales smaller than 0.32 @xmath61 mpc as we are not confident that we have sufficiently corrected for fibre collisions .",
    "we note that the best fitting parameters are not significantly changed if the smallest bin included in the fit is one smaller or larger .",
    "the errors on the fits are determined by finding the region of parameter space with a @xmath62 1 ( 1@xmath63 for 1 degree of freedom ) from the best fit and then determining the maximum and minimum parameter values within that region . for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , which depend on all three of the fit parameters , the region used contains @xmath62 3.53 ( 1@xmath63 for 3 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the resulting best fits are shown in figure [ fig : wphod ] and the best fit values for the hod parameters are given in table [ tab : fithod8 ] .",
    "we have checked that our best fitting model also provides a good description of our measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these parameters were not included in our definition of @xmath56 because the halo model of @xmath0 requires further assumptions than does @xmath58 .",
    "table  [ tab : fithod8 ] also provides the associated values of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the best fitting hods are shown in figure [ fig : nmhod ] .",
    "increasing @xmath70 ( see table [ tab : fithod9 ] ) increases @xmath71 and @xmath54 , and decreases @xmath55",
    ". the bias decreases to compensate for the increased clustering strength of the dark matter , and @xmath65 increases because @xmath71 is larger .",
    "the satellite fraction remains approximately the same , as @xmath55 has reduced to compensate for the increase in @xmath54 .",
    "for our standard choice of @xmath72 0.8 , the lrgs populate haloes with masses of order @xmath73 ; most of these lrgs are central galaxies - the satellite fractions are typically less than 10% . in the lower redshift samples @xmath65 is larger by about 50% , the bias is smaller by about 10% , and the satellite fraction has approximately doubled . the growth in @xmath65 is a consequence of a 10% increase in @xmath71 , a small decrease in @xmath74 , and a significant decrease in @xmath55 .",
    "it might seem paradoxical that decreasing @xmath55 increases the satellite fraction .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath54 is larger than the mass scale on which the halo mass function drops exponentially ( for @xmath34 ,",
    "this scale is @xmath75 and @xmath76 at @xmath11 and @xmath77 respectively ; when @xmath78 , these masses become @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) . thus , increasing @xmath55 increases the number of satellites in ( the exponentially rare ) haloes more massive than @xmath54 but _ decreases _ the number in less massive haloes which are exponentially more abundant .",
    "the larger satellite fractions at low redshift are best understood by thinking of the central and satellite populations separately .",
    "if there is no merging , then the high @xmath49 satellites are satellites even at low @xmath49 , whereas some of the high @xmath49 centrals have become satellites at low @xmath49 ( e.g. , if their host halo merged with a more massive halo ) . as a result , the satellite fraction increases .",
    "merging would act in the opposite sense ( satellites merging with satellites or with centrals would both reduce the satellite fraction ) .",
    "we note that the best fitting hods for the @xmath11 samples are in excellent agreement with those presented in @xcite who fit hods to the angular clustering of 380,000 lrgs selected using the 2slaq lrg selection criteria with photometric redshifts @xmath81 .",
    "paper i demonstrated that the evolution of the lf of lrgs was consistent with passive evolution of the stellar populations , and did not require any merging .",
    "if true , then as discussed in section [ sec : nomerge ] , the bias should evolve as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the growth factor @xcite . when applied to the bias of the best fitting @xmath11 hods for the two samples , the predicted bias factors are 1.98 @xmath10 0.02 at @xmath12 for the 2slaq selected sample and 2.20 @xmath10 0.04 at @xmath84 for the sdss selected sample .",
    "both these values are significantly larger than the measured values given in table [ tab : fithod8 ] , with the evolution in the 2slaq selected sample bias being incompatible with no - merging hypothesis at a significance of 98.4% .",
    "this is at a higher significance level to that calculated in section [ sec : nomerge ] using just the ratio of the large - scale clustering ; the inclusion of the number density constraints in the hod fits results in significantly smaller relative errors on the bias measurements than would be derived using clustering alone .",
    "this argument against pure passive evolution still uses only the large - scale clustering signals at the two epochs . in what follows ,",
    "we use the language of the halo model to show that the evolution of the small - scale clustering signal also contains interesting information , and can provide even greater constraints on the importance of merging .      if we specify how galaxies populate haloes at some early time , @xmath85",
    ", then we can estimate how this evolves as the haloes merge . if the haloes merge but the galaxies do not , then @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mean number of haloes of mass @xmath88 which are in haloes of mass @xmath89 at the later time , and @xmath90 for @xmath87 we use the expressions given by sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) , which generalise those of lacey & cole ( 1993 ) .",
    "the appendix shows that this guarantees that the comoving density @xmath57 is constant , whereas the large scale bias evolves in accordance with the continuity equation .",
    "whereas @xmath91 counts the objects which used to be centrals , @xmath92 counts the satellites .",
    "note that although @xmath93 , there is no guarantee that @xmath94 ; indeed , for @xmath95 , one expects @xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nomergers ] shows this explicitly ; at late times , massive haloes may host many galaxies which were centrals at the earlier time .",
    "if we force @xmath97 to have the same functional form as @xmath85 , then we can fit for @xmath71 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 at the later time .",
    "these fitted values can then be inserted into the halo model calculation of @xmath98 .",
    "the figure [ fig : nomergers ] shows that forcing this parametrisation allows a good but not perfect description of the passively evolved hod : the passively evolved hod has a more gradual transition from 0 to 1 .",
    "it will turn out that , for the present study , it is important to accurately model this transition .",
    "this is because we are studying rare objects which populate the high - mass end of the mass function . as a result , haloes",
    "which host zero or one galaxies are substantially more numerous than those which host more .",
    "hence , allowing some lower mass haloes to host more than one galaxy ( while making more such haloes void of galaxies ) can affect the number of small separation pairs substantially .    to illustrate this effect ,",
    "let @xmath99 denote the probability that a halo of mass @xmath89 contains no galaxies which were centrals at the higher redshift . then @xmath100 the second equation assumes that only one of the high-@xmath49 centrals in a halo continues to count as the low-@xmath49 central ; the others ( of which there are @xmath101 on average ) count as low-@xmath49 satellites . the mean galaxy count @xmath97 is given by inserting these expressions in equation  ( [ eq : ntot ] ) .",
    "this exercise shows that the problem is to model @xmath99 ; the next subsection studies three different models .",
    "the quantity @xmath99 counts the number of haloes of mass @xmath89 which were formed from mergers of objects which contained no galaxies .",
    "if the threshold @xmath53 were sharp , then this would be simply related to the number of haloes at low redshift which did not have a single high - redshift progenitor of mass greater than @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite have studied this problem ; they provide expressions for the @xmath102-th factorial moment @xmath103 of the progenitor distribution .",
    "( results in @xcite suggest that these expressions are quite accurate . ) in principle , these can be used to estimate @xmath104 , since @xmath105 , where the sum runs from @xmath106 to an upper limit which is set by mass conservation ; a halo of mass @xmath89 can have at most @xmath107 progenitors . if the hod where a step function then @xmath53 would be the same as in equation [ eq : ncen ] , else , it need not be . in practise , this is a complicated sum , so we have studied a few simpler models .    in our first model",
    ", we set @xmath108 this would be appropriate if the distribution of the number of high - redshift centrals in low - redshift haloes were poisson ( so @xmath109 ) , with mean @xmath110 , and only one of these centrals continues to count as the low - redshift central ; the others count as low-@xmath49 satellites .",
    "note that if @xmath111 , then @xmath112 , so there is no correction to the satellite counts . and if @xmath113 then @xmath114 and the satellite counts are increased by @xmath115 .",
    "thus , our model interpolates smoothly between these two sensible limits .",
    "we show the resulting evolution in the way galaxies populate haloes and in the clustering in the top panels of figures [ fig : halopm ] and [ fig:2ptpm ] as the red lines .    we have also studied what happens if , instead , we require a sharp transition between these two limits : set @xmath116 and @xmath117 when @xmath94 , and @xmath118 and @xmath119 otherwise .",
    "compared to the poisson model , this model has many more low - redshift haloes which host a single central high - redshift galaxy , and few which host more than one such galaxy ; the poisson model has fewer haloes which host galaxies , each allowed to host more than one high - redshift central .",
    "this decreases the number of high - redshift central pairs in haloes ( compared to the poisson model ) , which means that the number of central - satellite pairs is decreased , thus decreasing the small scale clustering signal .",
    "( of course , higher - order statistics will also be affected : the probability of finding a large region devoid of galaxies will be larger in the poisson model . )",
    "this model is plotted as the blue lines in the top panels of figures [ fig : halopm ] and [ fig:2ptpm ] .",
    "whereas this second model is perhaps too simple , the poisson model almost certainly allows too many low mass haloes to contain more than one galaxy , thus resulting in too many small scale pairs .",
    "indeed , mass conservation arguments @xcite strongly suggest that the progenitor counts should be sub - poisson ( @xmath120 ) , especially at low masses . furthermore , sub - poisson counts are clearly seen in the numerical models 10 and 30 of @xcite .",
    "the following binomial model conserves mass , and lies between these two extremes : @xmath121^{n_{\\rm max}}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 .",
    "we use this model as written for illustrative purposes only : in reality @xmath53 is unlikely to be the same quantity as in equation  ( [ eq : ncen ] ) , and the integer changes in @xmath123 as @xmath89 increases produce artificial discontinuities in @xmath97",
    ". nevertheless , this model predicts a small scale clustering signal which lies below that associated with the poisson model , but above that for the sharp threshold model shown as the green lines in the top panels of figures [ fig : halopm ] and [ fig:2ptpm ] .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:2ptpm ] shows that for all three models for @xmath99 the passive evolution of the clustering predicts a far greater increase in the clustering strength than is observed .",
    "this is caused by the presence of too many satellite galaxies , with satellite fractions of 27@xmath103% , 11@xmath101% and 19@xmath102% for the poisson , step and sub - poisson models respectively compared to 10@xmath102% for the best fitting hod to the data .",
    "once we have decided how likely it is that a low - redshift halo contains at least one high - redshift central galaxy , we also study models in which centrals merge onto centrals .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that central galaxies are expected to be more massive than satellites , so dynamical friction may be more effective at making these objects merge onto the true low - redshift central . to model this case",
    ", we again use equation  ( [ eq : ncm ] ) for @xmath124 , but we set @xmath125,\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the fraction of low - redshift satellites which were high - redshift centrals , and have not merged with one another or onto the new central object .",
    "when @xmath127 then this is the same as the no merger model of the previous section ; when @xmath128 , then the central galaxies of all the high - redshift haloes which merged to make a low - redshift halo have merged to make a single massive central galaxy .",
    "strictly speaking , the model says nothing about what these objects merged with - they may have merged with one another or with other satellites - it only assumes that the number of objects which merge scales with @xmath89 in the manner given above .",
    "however , the assumption that they merged onto the central object has considerable physical appeal .",
    "the result of applying this merger model for the three parametrisation of @xmath99 are shown in the bottom panels of figures [ fig : halopm ] and [ fig:2ptpm ] . for each model",
    "we chose the value of @xmath129 that best matches the large scale clustering , 0.1 , 0 , 0.25 for the poisson , step and sub - poisson models respectively . in all cases the agreement in the high mass haloes is much improved and the satellite fraction reduces to 11@xmath103% , 7@xmath102% , 10@xmath103% , comparable to the meaured value .",
    "the best fit at small scales is provided by the sub - poisson model ; this is reasuring , as it is the most physically motivated - although our implementation is not yet ideal .",
    "this suggests that the data are consistent with a generic prediction of hierarchical models - that the scatter in merger histories should produce sub - poisson scatter .",
    "the step model produces far too little small scale clustering , consistent with its lower satellite fraction , with both the poisson and sub - poisson models providing a reasonable match within the errors .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : hodevo ] a more detailed comparison of the passive and merger sub - poisson model with the measured correlation functions by dividing each by the best fit to the _ z _ = 0.19 measurement . also shown",
    "are the 1@xmath63 confidence regions calculated by propagating the error on the fit at _ z _ = 0.55 .",
    "this figure explicitly shows that the passive model is ruled out at high significance . on large scales ( @xmath130 3 @xmath61 ) mpc the passive model is incompatible with the measured clustering at @xmath49 = 0.2 at the 98% level , consistent with the constraints from the bias evolution given above .",
    "however , when smaller scales are included the passive model becomes increasingly incompatible with the measured clustering ; for scales larger than 1 @xmath61 mpc the passive model is excluded at a confidence level of greater than 99.9% , with the level of significance increasing with the inclusion of even smaller scales .",
    "the sub - poisson merger model is consistent with the data on all scales , even though the fraction of centrals which are alowed to merge is determined by matching only the large - scale clustering .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is necessary to allow some merging ( or some other method of removal ) of some fraction of the high redshift lrgs if we wish to reproduce the clustering at low redshift .",
    "this will have the effect of reducing the space density of the evolved population at low - redshift , something that we do not observe in the data .",
    "the change in the space density associated with the best fitting sub - poisson model is 9.2@xmath102.6% , suggesting that at most about 20% of the lrgs are merging with each other .",
    "in fact there are on average 2.34 high - redshift centrals in each merged halo , resulting in 16.1@xmath104.6% of lrgs experiencing an lrg - lrg merger .",
    "this is consistent with the constrainst provided by the luminosity function evolution of paper i. for comparison the possion model predicts a change in the space density of 19.4@xmath105.5% , suggesting that up to 40% of lrgs have been involved in a lrg - lrg merger .",
    "this number is highly inconsistent with the lf measurments and lends further support to the sub - poisson model .",
    "if we continue with the hypothesis that lrgs are merging with one another , it is reasonable to assume that some red galaxies too faint to be included in our sample at _ z _ = 0.55 will have also merged by _",
    "z _ = 0.19 , some of which will now be sufficiently luminous to be included in that sample .",
    "these galaxies will then increase the space density of the low - redshift lrg sample , potentially allowing the space density to remain unchanged . from the measurements we have no constraints on how many of these galaxies there are and how they are distributed within the dark matter haloes and",
    "thus how they might change the clustering .",
    "because the space density has changed in the merger model one could argue that we should compare our evolved high redshift 2pt correlation function with one measured from a sample of low redshift lrgs with a matching lower space density .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is deciding which galaxies to remove from our observed sample in order to reduce the space density",
    ".    an obvious choice would be to change the magnitude limit , thus removing the galaxies with the lowest stellar masses , equivalent to the approach taken in @xcite .",
    "however , in our merging model , we merge high redshift central galaxies , and it seems unlikely that these would represent the lrgs with the lowest stellar masses . alternatively ,",
    "if we randomly sample the low redshift hod , we will reduce the space density with out changing the clustering .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the lrgs , which are newly formed by the merging of lower luminosity red galaxies at low redshift , trace the dark matter in the same way as the whole lrg population .",
    "if this is a true reflection of the evolution of the lrg population , then the randomly sampled measured hod should look like the hod produced by our central merging model .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : halorand ] a comparison of the hod of the best fit sub - poisson merger model with the best hod fit to the _ z _ = 0.19 measurement , along with the measured _ z _ = 0.19 hod randomly sampled to match the space density of the merger model hod .",
    "the left side of figure [ fig : halorand ] shows the hods and the hods weighted by the number density of the haloes in the same way as we ve shown before .",
    "the right side shows the ratio of the hods ( top ) and the difference between the weighted hods ( bottom ) .",
    "for all but the lowest masses there is reasonable agreement between the randomly sampled hod and the merger hod . at the low mass end ,",
    "the large difference is due in part to our having to force the _ z _ = 0.19 hod to have a particular functional form ; a form which the central merger model is not required to satisfy .",
    "there is still some discrepancy beyond that caused by the steps introduced by the binomial form of the sub - poisson model , suggesting that any newly formed lrgs , which have been added to the low redshift sample , do not trace the dark matter in exactly the same way as the existing lrgs .",
    "a number of authors have recently tried to constrain the merger rate of lrgs using a variety of methods .",
    "@xcite estimate that 50% of massive galaxies ( @xmath131 ) have experienced a major merger since _ z _ = 0.8 .",
    "they also show that the merger rate increases with redshift and provide a fitting formula for this increase . applying this formula to the redshift interval we are considering here",
    "yields a merger rate of 21% between z=0.55 and z=0.19 .",
    "the merger rate defined by @xcite is the equivalent of the change in space density we measure i.e. 9.2% .",
    "however , @xcite sample has a space density of 33@xmath132mpc@xmath133 which is 20 times higher than ours and thus consists of galaxies with typically much less stellar mass .",
    "the merger rate is believed to increase with decreasing stellar mass so any direct comparisons between the two measurements are difficult .",
    "@xcite use the small scale clustering to estimate an lrg - lrg merger rate of 0.625% gyr@xmath13 for sdss lrgs at _ z _ = 0.25 .",
    "this would correspond to 2% from _ z _ = 0.55 to _ z _ = 0.19 far lower than our measurement . applying the fitting formula for the evolution of the merger rate from @xcite normalised to match the @xcite value at _ z",
    "_ = 0.25 yields a rate @xmath1344% , still a factor of 2.5 lower than our best fitting value .",
    "once again the galaxy samples are nt directly comparable since the space density of lrgs in the @xcite sample are a factor of 3.5 lower than the sample we use here , so one would expect the merger rate to be lower for the more massive @xcite lrgs .",
    "@xcite use n - body simulations to follow the accretion of halos sufficiently massive to host lrgs .",
    "they then compare this accretion history with the observed multiplicity function of lrgs at @xmath135 @xcite in order to constrain the lrg merger timescale and hence merger rate . using this method",
    "they find a lrg - lrg merger rate approximately a factor of two higher than that measured by @xcite using the small scale clustering of lrgs .    using a very similar methodology to our own , @xcite estimate that @xmath36 1/3 of the low - redshift satellite galaxies must be destroyed ( e.g. merge ) in order to match the clustering evolution of luminous red galaxies between _ z _ = 0.9 and _ z _ = 0.5 in the ndwfs .",
    "this corresponds to a merger rate of 3.4% gyr@xmath13 , which would be 10.6% over our redshift interval .",
    "this rate is comprable to our estimates ; however , based on the @xcite trend , one would expect a factor of 2 increase in the mean rate due to the higher redshift of the @xcite sample and also an increase due to the factor of 6 higher space density of their lrgs .",
    "there is , however , one important difference between the @xcite study and the one presented here that may rectify some of the descrepency in the merger rates . as mentioned above @xcite",
    "adjust the space density of the low redshift lrg sample hod fit with which they compare to their evolved high redshift sample .",
    "this is accomplished by adjusting the mass scale of the hod fit by 7% to higher masses .",
    "this approach , of course , would reduce the space density and increase the clustering , resulting in a lower amount of merging required to reduce the clustering produced by the passive evolution model to the measured level . reducing",
    "the fraction of high - redshift centrals allowed to merge in the model similarly increases the clustering but also decreases the space density .",
    "therefore there is only one unique combination of mass scale shift and merger rate that will match both the clustering and space density simultaneously .",
    "we find that increasing the _ z _ = 0.19 hod mass scale by 6% and allowing 63% of the high - redshift centrals to merge yields a large - scale bias of 1.93 and space density of 1.52@xmath132mpc@xmath133 for both the measured low - redshift hod and the evolved high - redshift hod .",
    "this corresponds to a merger rate of 7.5@xmath102.3% between _ z _ = 0.55 and _ z _ = 0.19 .",
    "figures [ fig : nmms ] and [ fig : xims ] show the hod and clustering respectively . within the errors the merger model yields a good match with the measured hod although the small scale clustering is a slightly poorer fit than the model with more merging shown in figure [ fig : hodevo ] .",
    "this value is now in better agreement to that which one might derive from the measurement of @xcite and the estimate of @xcite although it still seems marginally higher .",
    "this may of course be due to the uncertainty in the dependence of the merger rate with redshift and mass .",
    "alternatively the possible discrepancy with the @xcite result , which uses a very similar method coupled to n - body simulations could point to a deficiency in the current theoretical models of the conditional mass function used herein .",
    "+    finally , @xcite search for evidence of disturbance in close pairs of massive galaxies in @xmath136 0.12 groups to estimate the merger rate .",
    "they find that most of the mergers are occurring between approximately equal mass red progenitors and typically involve the central group galaxy , a picture that is consistent with the model we present here .",
    "they determine a merger rate 2 - 9 times higher than that of @xcite for comparable galaxies and suggest that this is because their minimum group mass is @xmath137 , higher than the typical halo mass of lrgs , and therefore the merger rate of lrgs increases with increasing halo mass .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : mfrac ] the merger rate as a function of halo mass for our three merger models .",
    "this figure does indeed indicate a rapid increase in the merger rate in haloes with mass up to 3 or 4@xmath138 , but with a decrease at higher masses .",
    "@xcite present a comparison of semi - analytic galaxy formation models to various properties of samples of lrgs very similar to the ones presented here .",
    "they find that the one of their models @xcite gives a good match to the luminosity function of sdss lrgs at _ z _ = 0.24 , but over predicts the abundance of 2slaq lrgs at _ z _ = 0.55 .",
    "the @xcite model is also able to reproduce the clustering of samples at both _",
    "z _ = 0.5 and at _ z _ = 0.24 .",
    "they also present hods generated from their models and compare them to the best fitting hods for the samples presented within this paper , where the hod fits are made using the same cosmological parameters as are used in the semi - analytic models .",
    "we only consider here the @xcite z=0.24 hod , which is shown in figure [ fig : nmmodel ] since it matches both the lf and clustering of sdss selected lrgs at _ z _ = 0.24 .",
    "the plotted hod has a quite different form from the one we measure and is not reproducible with the formulation we have used in this paper .",
    "in addition these models predict satellite fractions of 20 - 30% which is a factor of 2 - 3 times higher than our hod fits yield , but a merger rate for the 2slaq selected sample of @xmath365% over our redshift range , in good agreement with the observations .",
    "plotting the central and satellite hods separately for the @xcite model ( figure [ fig : nmmodel ] ) demonstrates the reason for the high satellite fraction .",
    "there are many haloes that do not have an lrg central but do have satellite lrgs .",
    "it may appear surprising that the central galaxy within a halo does not meet the lrg selection criteria .",
    "although the central galaxy is the most massive in terms of stellar mass and cold gas mass , it is not necessarily the brightest in the observer frame r - band .    a more likely scenario , however , is the case in which the central galaxy is the brightest galaxy in the halo , but does not match the lrg colour selection . in the @xcite model the suppression of gas cooling by agn heating ramps up gradually from intermediate mass haloes , so some gas is still cooling in haloes with @xmath139 and being directed onto the central galaxy .",
    "this supply of cold gas results in recent star formation in the central galaxy . in more massive haloes ,",
    "the cooling flow is suppressed more strongly , so central galaxies in these haloes experience no recent star formation",
    ". it may also be the case that there are too many red satellites due to the instantaneous stripping of the gas a galaxy experiences in the @xcite model .",
    "however , one does need to remain cautious with these comparisons since even though at _ z _ = 0.24 the @xcite model does match both the lf and clustering , it is unable to reproduce the evolution of the lf , suggesting that it is still lacking in some areas .",
    "even so , it does suggest that the form of the hod we are using may be too simplistic when a colour selection is included along with a luminosity cut .",
    "we will investigate this further in a forthcoming paper , which includes both a better treatment of the gas stripping @xcite and a refined agn feedback model .",
    "we present here a detailed analysis of the clustering of luminous red galaxies ( as defined by @xcite and @xcite ) as a function of redshift using samples of lrgs matched to have the same intrinsic colours and luminosities assuming passive evolution of their stellar populations .",
    "these galaxies represent the most massive in the universe with stellar masses lager than @xmath140 and space densities of @xmath141mpc@xmath4 .",
    "we find that :    * the amplitude of the clustering ( @xmath5 ) does not significantly evolve with redshift over @xmath142 , whereas there is a marginally significant decrease in the slope ( @xmath6 ) with increasing redshift . + * the lack of evolution in the clustering amplitude on large - scales is inconsistent with a picture in which the lrgs have purely passive evolution undergoing no major mergers over this time period , and rules out this passive model at @xmath143 significance . +",
    "* a hod where the fraction of haloes which host central galaxies @xmath144 and only haloes which host centrals can host satellites where the satellites are drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath145 is able to accurately reproduce the clustering and space density of our lrg samples . within this framework the lrgs",
    "are predicted to be hosted in haloes with a typical mass close to @xmath146 which increases by @xmath134 50% from @xmath11 to @xmath77 , and to have satellite fractions increasing from @xmath134 5 to 10% over this time .",
    "the lrgs are found to have a bias @xmath147 and which decreases with redshift at a much greater rate than would be predicted for the passive no merger case . + * we introduce an analytic approach to describe the evolution of the hod with redshift , and demonstrate that this guarantees that the comoving density remains constant and the large scale bias evolves in accordance with the continuity equation .",
    "we use this approach to further demonstrate that the passive evolution of the lrg hod from _ z _ = 0.55 is inconsistent with the measurements at _ z _ = 0.19 at greater than 99.9% significance , predicting far too many satellite galaxies at _ z _ = 0.19 and greatly over estimating the clustering strength on all scales .",
    "+ * we introduce a model in which high - redshift centrals are allowed to merge with other high - redshift centrals occupying the same halo at low - redshift .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that centrals are likely to be more massive than satellites , so dynamical friction may be more effective at making these objects merge with the true low - redshift central .",
    "this model is able to accurately match the large - scale clustering evolution of the lrgs .",
    "we demonstrate that the small scale clustering is dependent on the parametrisation of the scatter in halo merger histories .",
    "we investigate three models for this scatter and find that both the sub - poisson and poisson models are able to match the small - scale clustering evolution .",
    "however , the poisson model requires a much larger lrg - lrg merger rate ( 20% ) which is not favoured by either the evolution of the lrg luminoisty function @xcite or other independent measures of the lrg - lrg merger rate @xcite .",
    "we therefore favour the best motivated sub - poisson scatter giving observational support to this generic prediction of hierarchical models .",
    "+ * in order to match the clustering evolution we require an lrg - lrg merger rate of 7.5@xmath102.3% from _ z _ = 0.55 to _ z _ = 0.19 corresponding to 2.4% gyr@xmath13 .",
    "this is probably consistent with other measurements of the merger rate of massive red galaxies given the uncertainties in how the merger rate depends on the mass of the galaxy and evolves with redshift . + * although some merging is required to match the clustering evolution , the merger rate is sufficiently small that it is entirely compatible with the low rate of evolution in the luminosity function of lrgs found in @xcite .",
    "+ * we compare in detail the measured hod for one of the lrg samples to that predicted by the latest semi - analytic models of galaxy formation for a very similar sample of lrgs which matches both the luminosity function and clustering as described in @xcite .",
    "the model hod is very different to our fit , and would not be reproducible by the functional form of the hod we assume .",
    "in particular the model has many haloes that contain lrg satellites where the central is not an lrg .",
    "this suggests that a more sophisticated form of the hod may be required for galaxy samples selected by colour in addition to luminosity , although caution is required as the semi - analytic model is still unable to accurately reproduce the evolution of the lrg population . + * our halo model analysis of the relation between the low- and high - redshift populations is similar in spirit to those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , whereas their work used numerical simulations , our approach is entirely analytic .",
    "this means that our analysis relies heavily on the accuracy of current models of @xmath87 , the conditional mass function .",
    "these models are not particularly accurate for small redshift intervals @xcite , so we hope that our analysis will generate interest in improving these models . + * our analysis also highlights the need for a better understanding of the stochasticity in halo merger histories .",

    "this shows explicitly that the halo model calculation of the evolution of the bias in the no - merger model is the same as that derived from an argument based on the continuity equation ( nusser & davis 1994 ; fry 1996 ) .",
    "note that the bias factor evolves even though the number density does not .",
    "one might wonder if , although the bias factor evolves , the clustering strength itself does not .",
    "the ratio of the large - scale clustering signal at the two epochs is @xmath157 since @xmath158 , the later epoch is more strongly clustered .",
    "for example , for @xmath159 and @xmath160 , this factor is @xmath161 .",
    "setting @xmath162 illustrates a fact that is often overlooked : the clustering strength of highly biased objects ( i.e. , the most massive haloes ) evolves very little , even though the clustering of the dark matter itself has evolved significantly : @xmath163 .",
    "the most massive objects do not move far from their initial comoving positions .",
    "this calculation suggests a simple test of the null hypothesis that two populations having the same comoving number density are related by the no - merger evolution model : if the measured clustering signal has not evolved , or if the high redshift sample is more strongly clustered , then the hypothesis can be rejected .",
    "the continuity equation argument is restricted to the large scales on which linear theory applies .",
    "the virtue of writing this in terms of halo abundances is that it shows clearly how to extend the model to predict the clustering signal in the no - merger model even on small scales . in particular , two additional pieces of information",
    "are required : a model for how the galaxies are distributed around the centre of their parent haloes , and the second factorial moment @xmath164 of the distribution @xmath165 of the number of galaxies @xmath166 at fixed halo mass @xmath89 .",
    "sheth et al . (",
    "2001 ) show that , on scales larger than approximately half a megaparsec , it is more important to model the first two moments @xmath167 and @xmath164 accurately than the density profiles ; in particular , the approximation that the spatial distribution of the galaxies is the same as that of the dark matter is sufficiently accurate .",
    "hence , if we know the second factorial moment of how galaxies populate haloes , then we can describe the no - merger correlation function on small scales as well .",
    "simulations indicate that in haloes which host more than one galaxy , @xmath168 is a poisson distribution with mean @xmath169 .",
    "this specifies @xmath164 ."
