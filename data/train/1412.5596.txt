    "<S> our results unveil a subtle interplay between entanglement and general relativity , and significantly improve the potential of probing the radical effects that may exist at the interface between relativity and quantum theory .    </S>",
    "<S> causality aligns with our natural sense of reality . </S>",
    "<S> we expect there to be a natural chronology to our reality - two events should not be simultaneous causes for each other . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of causality defies classical logic , resulting in causal paradoxes with no simple solution - the iconic example being the case where a man travels back in time to kill his own grandfather . </S>",
    "<S> thus , physical predictions that break causality face intense scrutiny - often considered to be theoretical artifacts that are likely suppressed once we gain a more complete understanding of reality - motivating various chronology protection conjectures  @xcite </S>",

    "<S> this resolution , however , has radical operational consequences . many foundational constraints of quantum theory break . </S>",
    "<S> non - orthogonal quantum states can be perfectly distinguished , the uncertainty principle can be violated , and arbitrary unknown quantum states can be cloned to any fixed fidelity  @xcite . in harnessing these effects , many problems thought to be intractable to standard quantum computers now field efficient solutions  @xcite . though radical , these effects seem somewhat rationalized in the context of requiring broken causality - the sentiment being that they are curiosities that will vanish when causality is imposed .     </S>",
