    "initially , lloyd demonstrated a technique for the efficient simulation of hamiltonians constructed as a tensor product of simpler hamiltonians @xcite , and over time new methods and techniques have been introduced which have generalised the class of hamiltonians which can be efficiently simulated while simultaneously tightening the relevant cost and error bounds @xcite-@xcite .",

    ", one would like to begin by simulating quantum channels , representing the most general quantum dynamics possible , and dynamical semigroups of quantum channels , which describe markovian dynamics - continuous time processes resulting from interactions with a markovian environment in the born approximation @xcite . a straightforward methodology for the simulation of these systems",
    "is instantly suggested by the stinespring dilation theorem @xcite , in which one introduces an initially pure state environment , with size the square of the system size in the general case , such that one may simulate the open system dynamics of the system via hamiltonian dynamics of the larger system - environment combination .",

    "an important early contribution was also made by bacon et al .",
    "@xcite , who provide a method for decomposing the generators of markovian evolution into simpler  primitive \" generators . in particular , they demonstrate that for the single qubit case universal simulation of markovian dynamics requires only the ability to simulate a specific continuous one parameter family of generators , as well as the ability to implement the recombination methods of linear combination and unitary conjugation .",
    "the development of collision models @xcite for understanding quantum decoherence processes also suggests a constructive approach for the simulation of open quantum systems , and combining these insights with the results of bacon et al .",
    "allowed for the development of collision model based methods for the simulation of single - qubit unital semigroups @xcite , generalised phase - damping processes @xcite and indivisible qubit channels @xcite .    more recently",
    "the notion of dissipative quantum computation and state preparation @xcite has been introduced , in which under the assumption of markovian dynamics described by a lindblad master equation , the interactions of a system with its environment are no longer considered destructive , but are instead utilised to drive a desired computational process .",
    "this formalism offers a natural setting for the simulation of open quantum systems and research in this direction has resulted in successful experimental demonstrations of the dissipative simulation of complex many - body spin models @xcite . in addition , dissipative quantum computation has allowed for alternative approaches to state preparation @xcite-@xcite and universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "importantly however , it has recently been shown that dissipative quantum computing is no more powerful than the traditional circuit model - the so called  dissipative church turing thesis \" @xcite .",

    "given these previous results we address in this paper the problem of constructing explicitly these efficient quantum circuits for the simulation of arbitrary markovian processes within the traditional circuit model of quantum computation .",

    "the structure of this paper is as follows : we begin by introducing the setting and rigorously defining the problem we wish to address . following this we proceed in section [ decomps ] by presenting the method , introduced in @xcite , for the decomposition of an arbitrary generator of a single - qubit markov semigroup . in section [ recombs ]",
    "we generalise results from @xcite into the setting applicable for the problem addressed here , effectively demonstrating a method for the efficient recombination of the generators decomposed in section [ decomps ] .",

    "natural avenues arise for extension of this work .",
    "the first is investigation of improvements to the method presented here for the simulation of arbitrary single - qubit markovian open quantum systems . in particular",
    ", it will be of interest to determine whether an optimality result , analogous to the  no fast forward theorem \" of hamiltonian simulation @xcite exists in this generalised context , in which case the results of this paper would be close to optimal for the single qubit case . the second natural extension of this work is development of methods allowing for the construction of explicit algorithms for the simulation of multi - qubit and multi - qudit markovian open systems .",
    "however , the work presented in this paper relies heavily on geometric properties of single - qubit channels and as such generalisation of this work would require investigation into the geometric and convex structure of multi - particle quantum channels , at present an open question @xcite .",
    "this work is based upon research supported by the south african research chair initiative of the department of science and technology and national research foundation .",
    "ryan sweke acknowledges the financial support of the national research foundation sarchi program . the authors would also like to thank the referee for the insightful comments and suggestions",
    "given the generator @xmath1 of a semigroup of quantum channels ( with @xmath255 ) one can find the left and right eigenoperators @xmath256 and @xmath257 satisfying @xcite ,          for any hermitian operator @xmath260 and for all density matrices @xmath65 . using this left action",
    "one finds that @xmath261 = \\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath262 .",
    "furthermore , any density matrix @xmath263 can be expressed in this basis ( known as the damping basis ) , such that @xcite                      b.c .",
