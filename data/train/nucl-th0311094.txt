    "two dominant and often competing modes characterize the structure of atomic nuclei .",
    "one is the single - particle structure that is demonstrated by the validity of the mean - field concept ; the other is the many - particle collective behavior that is manifested through nuclear deformation .",
    "the spherical shell model is the theory of choice whenever single - particle behavior dominates @xcite . when deformation dominates , the elliott @xmath5 model or its pseudo - su(3 ) extension is the natural choice @xcite .",
    "this duality manifests itself in two dominant components in the nuclear hamiltonian : respectively , the single - particle term , @xmath9 , and a collective quadrupole - quadrupole interaction , @xmath10 .",
    "it follows that a simplified hamiltonian @xmath11 has two solvable limits .",
    "= 4.0 in    to probe the nature of such a system , one can consider a simpler problem : the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator in a box of size @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "as for real nuclei , this system has a finite volume and a restoring force of a harmonic oscillator type , @xmath13 . for this model , shown in figure [ ho1dbox potential ] , there is a well - defined energy scale that measures the strength of the potential at the boundary of the box , @xmath14 .",
    "the value of @xmath15 determines the nature of the low - energy excitations of the system .",
    "specifically , depending on the value of @xmath15 there are three spectral types :    * for @xmath16 the spectrum is simply that of a particle in a box ; * at some value of @xmath17 , the spectrum begins with @xmath15 followed by the spectrum of a particle in a box perturbed by the harmonic oscillator potential ; * for sufficiently large @xmath18 the spectrum is that of a harmonic oscillator below @xmath15 which is followed by the perturbed spectrum of a particle in a box .",
    "= 4.0 in    the last scenario ( 3 ) is the most interesting since it provides an example of a two - mode system . for this case",
    "the use of two sets of basis vectors , one representing each of the two limits , has physical appeal , especially at energies near @xmath15 .",
    "one basis set consists of the harmonic oscillator states ; the other set consists of basis states of a particle in a 1d box .",
    "we call this combination a mixed - mode / oblique - basis approach",
    ". in general , the oblique - basis vectors form a nonorthogonal and overcomplete set . even though a mixed spectrum is expected around @xmath15 , our numerical study that includes up to 50 harmonic oscillator states below @xmath15 , shows that the first order perturbation theory in energy using particle in a 1d box wave functions as the zero order approximation to the exact functions works quite well after the breakdown of the harmonic oscillator like spectrum .",
    "this observation is demonstrated in figure [ ho1dbox spectrum ] which shows the relative deviations from the exact energy spectrum for a particle in a 1d box .",
    "= 4.0 in    although the spectrum seems to be well described using first order perturbation theory based on a particle in a 1d box wave functions , the exact wave functions near @xmath15 have an interesting structure .",
    "for example , the zero order approximation to the wave function used to calculate the energy may not be present at all in the structure of the exact wave function as shown in figure [ coherent mixing 1dho ] .",
    "another feature also seen in figure [ coherent mixing 1dho ] is the common shape of the distribution of the non - zero components along the particle in a 1d box basis .",
    "the graph in figure [ coherent mixing 48cr ] shows this same effect in nuclei , which is usually attributed to coherent mixing @xcite .",
    "an application of the theory to @xmath0 @xcite , using the realistic two - body interaction of wildenthal @xcite , demonstrates the validity of the mixed - mode concept . in this case",
    "the oblique - basis consists of the traditional spherical states , that yields a diagonal representation of the single - particle interaction , together with collective @xmath5 configurations , that yields a diagonal representation of the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "the results shown in figures [ mg24oblique con ] and [ mg24oblique bar ] illustrate typical outcomes .",
    "for example , a sm(2)+(8,4)&(9,2 ) model space ( third bar in figure [ mg24oblique bar ] ) reproduces the binding energy ( within 2% of the full - space result ) as well as the low - energy spectrum . for this case",
    "the calculated eigenstates have greater than 90% overlap with the full - space results . in contrast , for a pure @xmath19-scheme spherical shell - model calculation one needs about 60% of the full space , sm(4 )  the fourth bar in figure [ mg24oblique bar ] , to obtain comparable results .",
    "= 4.5 in    = 4.5 in    = 4.5 in    studies of the lower @xmath2-shell nuclei @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , using the realistic kuo - brown-3 ( kb3 ) interaction @xcite , show strong @xmath5 symmetry breaking due mainly to the single - particle spin - orbit splitting .",
    "thus the kb3 hamiltonian could also be considered a two - mode system .",
    "this is further supported by the behavior of the yrast band b(e2 ) values that seems to be insensitive to fragmentation of the @xmath5 symmetry . specifically , the quadrupole collectivity as measured by the b(e2 ) strengths remains high even though the @xmath5 symmetry is rather badly broken .",
    "this has been attributed to a quasi - su(3 ) symmetry @xcite where the observables behave like a pure @xmath5 symmetry while the true eigenvectors exhibit a strong coherent structure with respect to each of the two bases .",
    "this provides justification for further study of the implications of mixed - mode shell - model studies .",
    "next we discuss oblique - basis type calculations for @xmath1 using the kb3 interaction @xcite .",
    "we confirm that the spherical shell model ( ssm ) provides a significant part of the low - energy wave functions within a relatively small number of ssmc while a pure @xmath5 shell - model with only few @xmath5 irreps is unsatisfactory .",
    "this is the opposite of the situation in the lower @xmath20-shell . since the ssm yields relatively good results for sm(2 ) , combining the two basis sets yields even better results with only a very small increase in the overall size of the model space .",
    "in particular , results in a sm(2)+su(3 ) model space ( 47.7% + 2.1% of the full @xmath2-shell space ) are comparable with sm(3 ) results ( 84% ) .",
    "therefore , as for the @xmath20-shell , combining a few @xmath5 irreps with sm(2 ) configurations yields excellent results , such as correct spectral structure , lower ground - state energy , and improved structure of the wave functions .",
    "however , in the lower @xmath20-shell @xmath5 is dominant and ssm is recessive ( but important ) and in the lower @xmath2-shell one finds the opposite , that is , ssm is dominant and @xmath5 is recessive ( but important ) .    for @xmath1 adding the @xmath5 to the sm(2 ) increases the model space from 47.7% to 49.8% and gives results that are slightly better than the sm(3 ) which is 84% of the full space . in @xmath0",
    "the position of the k=2 band head is correct for the su(3)-type calculations but not for the low - dimensional sm(n ) calculations @xcite . in @xmath1",
    "it is the opposite , that is , the sm(n)-type calculations reproduce the position of the k=2 band head while su(3)-type calculations can not",
    ". furthermore , the low - energy levels for the @xmath5 case are higher than for the sm(n ) case . nonetheless , the spectral structure in the oblique - basis calculation is good and the sm(2)+(12,0)&(10,1 ) spectrum ( @xmath2150% of the full space ) is comparable with the sm(3 ) result ( 84% ) .",
    "the overlaps of su(3)-type calculated eigenstates with the exact ( full shell - model ) results are , often less than 40% , but the sm(n ) overlaps are considerably bigger with sm(2)-type calculations yielding an 80% overlap with the exact states while the results for sm(3 ) show overlaps greater than 97% , which is consistent with the fact that sm(3 ) covers 84% of the full space .",
    "on the other hand , sm(2)+(12,0)&(10,1)-type calculations yield results that are as good as those for sm(3 ) in only about 50% of the full - space and sm(1)+(12,0)&(10,1 ) overlaps are often bigger than the sm(2 ) overlaps . the oblique - bases",
    "sm(2)+(12,0)&(10,1 ) results for @xmath1 ( @xmath2150% ) yields results that are comparable with the sm(3 ) results ( @xmath2184% ) .",
    "in short , the oblique - basis scheme works well for @xmath1 , only in this case , in contrast with the previous results for @xmath0 where @xmath5 was found to be dominant and ssm recessive , in the lower @xmath2-shell ssm is dominant and @xmath5 recessive .",
    "in this section , we consider the transition from the @xmath22 vibrational to the @xmath5 rotational limit of the interacting boson model using a schematic hamiltonian .",
    "the behavior of low - lying energy levels and e2 transition rates are studied in detail .",
    "the analysis shows that as one moves from the @xmath5 to the @xmath22 limit the system transforms from one of maximum deformation to one that is maximally triaxial and soft with the onset of strong triaxiality occuring around the @xmath7 critical point .",
    "understanding shape phase transitions of a finite many - body system is paramount to understanding the system s underlying dynamics .",
    "the three possible phases that can occur in the interacting boson model for nuclei have been classified as @xmath22 , @xmath5 , and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 transitional description of the rare - earth nuclei nd , sm , gd , and dy was first reported in @xcite , including detailed results for most quantities of physical interest .",
    "evidence for coexisting phases at low energy in the spherical - deformed transitional nucleus @xmath25sm was also analyzed using @xmath26 transitional theory and the results show that the two phases coexist in a very small region of parameter space around the critical point @xcite .",
    "recently , since the discovery of the @xmath7 symmetry in this region @xcite , the spherical to axially deformed shape phase transition has attracted further attention @xcite .    in order to take a close look at the @xmath24 shape phase transition , we study transitional patterns of many physical quantities , such as low - lying energy levels , isomer shifts , e2 transition rates , and some related quantities across the @xmath24 leg of the casten triangle .",
    "no attempt is made to relate the results to realistic nuclei ; rather , our purpose is to gain a better understanding the nature of the @xmath24 transition . in the study , the schematic hamiltonian @xmath27 which has been suggested as a suitable form for describing nuclei in this region is used , where the parameter @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 is the phase parameter , @xmath30 is a linear function of the total number of bosons @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the number of @xmath33 bosons , and @xmath34 .",
    "we note that @xmath35 was used in @xcite , while @xmath36 was adopted in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , the critical point @xmath37 will be quite different for different choices of the function @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is , up to a constant , equivalent to the one used in @xcite and @xcite with the relation @xmath38 .    in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( 1 ) ,",
    "we expand eigenstates of ( 1 ) in terms of the @xmath39 basis vectors @xmath40 as    @xmath41 where the quantum number @xmath42 indicating the @xmath42-th level with angular momentum quantum number @xmath43 is introduced , and @xmath44 is the expansion coefficients . since the total number of bosons @xmath31 is fixed for a given nucleus , the above eigenstates will also be denoted as @xmath45 in the following , in which value of the phase parameter @xmath46 is explicitly shown . in our calculation , the orthonormalization process with respect to the band label @xmath47 and the phase convention for the @xmath48 basis vectors proposed in @xcite is used . by using analytic expressions for @xmath49 reduced matrix element of @xmath33-boson creation or annihilation operator @xcite and an algorithm @xcite for generating the @xmath48 wigner coefficients , the eigen - equation that simultaneously determines the eigenenergy and the corresponding set of the expansion coefficients @xmath50 can be established .    to explore the transitional patterns",
    ", we fix the total number of bosons at @xmath51 and allow the phase parameter @xmath46 to vary in the closed interval @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the functional form of @xmath30 is chosen to be the same as that used in @xcite with @xmath36 unless otherwise specifically noted .",
    "some low - lying energy levels as a function of @xmath46 are shown in figure [ f1 ] from which one can see that there is a minimum in the excitation energy around @xmath53 , which corresponds to the spherical - deformed shape coexistence region which is also referred to as the critical ( phase transition ) region .",
    "it can also be seen that the minimum is not exactly the same for all the levels , but all fall within the spherical - deformed shape coexistence region .",
    "two energy ratios , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are shown as a function of @xmath46 in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 drops rather precipitously from the axially deformed limit , @xmath57 , to the spherical limit , @xmath58 , over the range @xmath59 and then remains at the spherical limit value for @xmath60 . while the ratio @xmath61 drops rather smoothly as a function of @xmath46 from the deformed limit , @xmath62 when @xmath63 , to the spherical limit , @xmath64 when @xmath65 .",
    "the sharpest change occurs around the critical point @xmath66 when the absolute value of the derivative of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath46 reaches the maximal value .    to show how the transition occurs in the ground state ,",
    "the amplitudes @xmath67 are plotted as functions of @xmath46 in figure [ f3 ] , which indicate that the most rapid changes in these amplitudes also occur within the coexistence region .    in order to explore the exact nature of the critical point with different choices for the linear function @xmath30 ,",
    "overlaps @xmath68 with @xmath69 or @xmath70 as suggested in @xcite with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , respectively , were calculated .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ f4 ] , from which it can be clearly seen that the critical ( crossing ) point changes with different choices of the function @xmath30 .",
    "the larger the @xmath30 value , the smaller the critical point value @xmath75 .",
    "this conclusion confirms the early result shown in @xcite , in which the critical point value is very large with @xmath76 corresponding to @xmath35 , while for @xmath77 when @xmath36 with @xmath51 is used @xcite .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the critical point may differ from one excited state to the next for the same choice of @xmath30 .",
    "our calculation shows that the critical points for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are almost the same , but they are somewhat different for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it should also be noted that curves of the overlaps @xmath83 with @xmath69 or @xmath70 even become irregular for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "typical examples of these curves for higher excited states are shown in figure [ f5 ] , which indicate that the critical point for higher excited states may be quite different from that for ground state .",
    "this behavior will be seen in other observables such as e2 transition rates since the critical behavior of the initial and final states may quite different from that of ground state .",
    "various b(e2 ) values and ratios among the low - lying levels were studied using the e2 operator is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the effective charge .",
    "some b(e2 ) values and ratios were found to be sensitive to the shape phase transition .",
    "figure [ f7 ] provides three b(e2 ) values , b(e2 , @xmath90 ) , b(e2 , @xmath91 ) , and b(e2 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "there is a small peak around @xmath93 for b(e2 , @xmath94 ) and b(e2 , @xmath91 ) , while there is a saddle point around @xmath95 for b(e2 , @xmath96 ) .",
    "as seen previously , the peak and saddle points in these b(e2 ) values are different from the critical point of the ground state due to different critical behavior of the excited states .",
    "figure [ f8 ] provides six b(e2 ) ratios , b(e2 ; @xmath97)/ b(e2 ; @xmath98 ) , b(e2 ; @xmath99)/ b(e2 ; @xmath100 ) , b(e2 ; @xmath96)/ b(e2 ; @xmath100 ) , b(e2 ; @xmath101)/ b(e2 ; @xmath92 ) , b(e2 ; @xmath91)/ b(e2 ; @xmath102 ) , and b(e2 ; @xmath103)/ b(e2 ; @xmath104 ) .",
    "these ratios all undergo noticeable changes within the coexistence region .",
    "the most distinctive signature is shown in b(e2 ; @xmath101)/ b(e2 ; @xmath105 ) , in which there is a giant peak around @xmath95 .    in order to study shape of nuclei around the critical point ,",
    "we use the relation between the bohr variables @xmath106 of the collective model and the @xmath107 labels that define the irreducible representation of the @xmath5 @xcite . in this algebraic approach",
    ", the bohr variables can be expressed as a functional of @xmath5 casimir operator of the second order @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 can be taken as a constant and @xmath111 and @xmath112 should be regarded as operators , of which the results are usual @xmath113 and @xmath114 values when they are applied onto the basis vector of @xmath5 .",
    "using these definitions for @xmath115 and @xmath116 , we can calculate expectation values , @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the ground state , and the corresponding root mean square deviations @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "these quantities can be used to display shape uncertainty as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath119 and @xmath120 are zero when nucleus is spherically deformed with @xmath121 indicating there is a definite shape , while the shape becomes less well defined as @xmath46 moves away from zero .",
    "the values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 are not small in the spherical limit ( @xmath122 ) due to the quadrupole vibration being not negligible .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ f9 ] that there are also obvious changes in @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the critical region around @xmath125 . over the whole range ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath124 change is small .",
    "in contrast , @xmath119 reaches a maximum value around @xmath126 which deviates a little from the critical point @xmath66 of the ground state , but is still near the critical region .",
    "this distinctive signature shows that nucleus is the softest in the critical region .",
    "this fact can help us to understand why there is a saddle region in most excited levels . since",
    "a nucleus in this region is comparatively soft , its shape can be changed easily with very little energy . hence , nuclei in this region can easily be excited , which results in relatively smaller energy gaps in this soft critical region .    in summary ,",
    "transitional patterns from the vibrational , @xmath22 , to the rotational , @xmath5 , limit of the interacting boson model with a schematic hamiltonian have been studied .",
    "the transitional behavior of low - lying energy levels , isomer shifts , e2 transition rates , and related quantities over the whole @xmath24 transitional region were explored .",
    "the results show that there are many distinctive signatures in the energy levels , wavefunctions , isomer shift , be2 values and ratios , and expectation value of bohr variables near the critical point .",
    "generally speaking , critical the behavior of excited states are different from that of ground state , which may lead to different critical point for some physical quantities that link the two . in comparison with the result shown in @xcite , a nucleus with @xmath7 symmetry can approximately be described by the @xmath24 transitional theory within the critical region .",
    "our analysis also shows that shapes of nucleus in the critical region is not well - dfined ; that is , a nucleus with @xmath7 symmetry is soft .",
    "future research may provide justification for an extension of the theory to multi - mode shell - model calculations .",
    "for example , an immediate extension of the current scheme could use eigenvectors of the pairing interaction @xcite within an @xmath127 algebraic approach to the nuclear structure @xcite in addition to collective @xmath5 configurations and spherical shell model states . alternatively ,",
    "hamiltonian driven basis sets could be considered .",
    "for example , the method could use eigenstates of near closed shell nuclei obtained from a full shell - model calculation to form hamiltonian driven j - pair states for mid - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "this would mimic the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite and the so - called broken - pair theory @xcite .",
    "likewise , the three exact limits of the ibm @xcite can be considered to comprise a three - mode system .",
    "nonetheless , the real benefit of the mixed - mode approach is expected when the spaces encountered are too large to allow for exact calculations .",
