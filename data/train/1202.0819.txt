    "a growing variety of measurements in astrophysics rely on , or are enabled by , precise astronomical spectroscopy . for example",
    ", searches for extra - solar planets via the radial velocity method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rely on the reproducibility of stellar radial velocities over time - scales up to several years .",
    "night - to - night reproducibility better than @xmath3 has been achieved when integrated over spectral ranges of @xmath0@xmath4@xmath5-  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another example is the use of relative velocity shifts between ionic and molecular transitions in highly redshifted quasar absorption systems to constrain cosmological variations in fundamental constants , such as the fine - structure constant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and proton - to - electron mass ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "velocity precisions averaged over several transitions in hundreds of absorption systems reach @xmath0@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "much more precise and accurate spectroscopy would be required if the acceleration of the universal expansion is to be measured by monitoring the slowly changing redshifts of lyman-@xmath7 forest absorption lines in quasar spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is one possible aim of the codex spectrograph proposed for the european extremely large telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two epochs of spectra are required , taken decades apart , with velocity precision approaching 1  integrated over @xmath0@xmath4@xmath5  ranges .",
    "the calibration of individual quasar exposures would therefore need to be reproducible to within @xmath01  over several decades .",
    "many optical and mechanical elements of the telescope and spectrograph may need replacing on such a time - scale , or observations from other telescopes may need to be employed to achieve the required signal - to - noise ratio ( ) .",
    "thus , it would be preferable to _ absolutely _ calibrate the wavelength scale of each quasar exposure .",
    "laser frequency combs ( lfcs ; e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are a promising candidate for such highly precise , and possibly absolute , wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrographs @xcite .",
    "the train of pulses that are output from a frequency comb appear in frequency space as a spectrum of lines `` modes '' uniformly spaced by the pulse repetition rate .",
    "this repetition rate can readily be synchronised with an absolute radio frequency reference , e.g.  a global positioning system ( gps ) signal or atomic clock .",
    "thus , an absolute , very dense and perfectly regular calibration spectrum could be used to calibrate astronomical spectrographs .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , in principle , recording such a frequency comb signal on a conventional charge coupled device ( ccd ) typical of modern astronomical spectrographs would provide enough spectral information to reach the @xmath01  calibration precision required for measuring real - time drifts in the redshifts of lyman-@xmath7 absorption lines in quasar spectra .",
    "prototype frequency comb calibration systems are now being tested at various observatories .",
    "the first lfc demonstration on an astronomical spectrograph by @xcite achieved state - of - the - art calibration precision of @xmath09  in near infra - red ( ir , 1.5@xmath8 m ) astronomical spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite used a frequency - doubled yb - doped fibre laser to calibrate a single echelle order at @xmath0500 nm of a highly stable vacuum spectrograph ( harps ) with 15  accuracy , precision and reproducibility over several - hour time - scales . @xcite calibrated the tres spectrograph with an accuracy better than 1  at @xmath0400 nm using a tunable ti : sapphire lfc . while these tests demonstrate the main advantage of lfc calibration  the high density of high- , equally - spaced modes ",
    "some challenges discussed by @xcite still remain .",
    "for example , the above tests employed lfcs covering only small wavelength ranges ( typically @xmath010 nm ) . simultaneously and uniformly illuminating the entire optical wavelength range covered by modern echelle spectrographs is highly desirable .",
    "another important advantage of lfc calibration is that the high density of recorded modes and the absolute frequency scale should enable direct characterization of many , if not all , instrumental systematic errors @xcite .",
    "for example , in calibrating a single echelle order of harps , @xcite found discontinuities in the calibration curve ( i.e.  wavelength vs.  spectral pixel ) at regular intervals of 512 spectral pixels .",
    "they attributed this to imperfections in ccd pixel size , shape and/or sensitivity imparted to every 512th pixel during the manufacturing process of the ccd mask .",
    "even subtler problems in the ccd or spectrograph optics are likely to limit spectroscopic accuracy unless they are first detected , measured and then removed with lfcs .",
    "one such problem is possible intra - pixel sensitivity ( ips ) variations .",
    "individual ccd pixels can show large spatial variations in sensitivity to photons depending on the manufacturing process and depth of the depletion layer @xcite .",
    "pixels can also vary in size or shape and may contain small defects .",
    "electron counts may also be registered in a pixel when a photon enters near the edge of a neighbouring one , depending on incidence angle .",
    "these , and many other effects , lead to apparent ips variations .",
    "the development of ` deep depletion ' ccds has mitigated many of these effects , but even moderate ips variations compared to those found by @xcite might affect measurements of , for example , possible variations in the fundamental constants .",
    "thus , it is vital to accurately measure the detailed behaviour of ccd chips  even of individual pixels  if photon - limited spectroscopic precision is to be demonstrated .    this paper reports a new demonstration of an optical lfc using a very high resolution astronomical spectrograph with the aim of measuring _ in situ _ any ips variations in a modern ccd .",
    "section [ sec : setup ] explains our experimental setup .",
    "section [ sec : model ] sets out the basis for our analysis to extract the ips variations from the comb exposures .",
    "section [ sec : single ] contains our main analysis and results .",
    "section [ sec : series ] describes how series of lfc exposures might allow absolute wavelength calibration of ccds .",
    "we summarize our main results and conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "to demonstrate that the intra - pixel sensitivity ( ips ) variations in an astronomical spectrograph s ccd can be measured _ in situ _ , we tested an lfc at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , australia , on the 9th april 2010 .",
    "the ultra - high - resolution facility ( uhrf ) spectrograph has a very high resolution mode , with resolving power @xmath9 ( where fwhm is resolution element s full width at half maximum ) , which means a relatively simple lfc can be employed ( section [ ssec : lfcdetails ] ) .",
    "our experimental setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . after summarizing the basics of lfcs immediately below",
    ", we describe the important elements of our particular setup , including our lfc , the interface with the uhrf spectrograph and the ccd whose ips variations we seek to measure .",
    "we also describe the data reduction steps taken before the analyses described in subsequent sections .      a laser will generate light at discrete frequency modes throughout the spectral bandwidth of its gain material as long as the optical gain exceeds the losses for a full round - trip in the laser cavity at each of the mode frequencies .",
    "the frequency of a mode is determined by ensuring that there is a whole number of wavelengths in one cavity round trip .",
    "conventionally , much effort is expended in ensuring that only a single mode can circulate at any time in the cavity ; however , for mode - locked lasers , one attempts to have many modes circulating simultaneously .",
    "in addition , by including an intensity - dependent loss in the cavity it is possible to bring about a mode - locked state in which the laser s output energy is delivered in a single , intense and temporally very short pulse . in this condition",
    "each mode maintains a fixed and well - defined phase relationship with all other modes .",
    "the frequency spacing between all pairs of adjacent modes , called the repetition frequency , is exactly the same and equal to the reciprocal of the round - trip pulse circulation time in the cavity .",
    "further details of the operation of mode - locked lasers can be found in @xcite .",
    "the output spectrum of the mode - locked laser appears as a comb of modes where the @xmath10th mode has a frequency , @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 where @xmath10 is typically of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "the repetition frequency , @xmath14 , is the mode spacing between the ` teeth ' of the comb . the carrier - envelope offset frequency ( @xmath15 )",
    "represents the offset of each mode from an exact harmonic of the repetition frequency , while in the time domain it expresses the rate at which the relative phase of the carrier and pulse envelope evolves between each pulse .",
    "for the comb to be useful as a high - precision frequency scale , @xmath14 must be stabilised and @xmath15 should be either stabilised or monitored .",
    "the advantage of the mode - locked laser is that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in the radio frequency range so they can be locked ( or monitored ) using relatively simple electronics .",
    "such a comb provides a series of regular and closely spaced modes , the absolute frequencies of which are known to an accuracy limited only by that of the radio - frequency reference .",
    "the first frequency combs were based on solid - state ti : sapphire crystals ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which , despite having exceptional frequency stability , typically require extensive supporting infrastructure and careful expert maintenance .",
    "in contrast , fibre - based mode - locked lasers are low - cost , have ` turn - key ' operation and , importantly for demonstration at remote astronomical observatories , are portable . for these reasons we employ a commercial fibre - laser for this experiment using a stabilisation scheme developed at the university of western australia @xcite .",
    "this laser delivers a 100-fs duration pulse at 1560 nm with @xmath16mhz repetition frequency at an average power of approximately 250mw .",
    "@xmath14 was stabilised by detecting its 100th harmonic on a very fast photodiode and referencing to a stable microwave signal derived from a high quality synthesizer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the laser output is frequency - doubled in a periodically - poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) crystal , simultaneously producing a red comb with 90mw at 780 nm together with a green comb with 200@xmath8w at the third harmonic , 520 nm .",
    "the extraction of the offset frequency is as follows ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "firstly , the green ( third harmonic ) comb is separated from the red ( second harmonic ) comb and travels a separate path on the optical table . meanwhile ,",
    "the red comb is frequency - shifted to the green wavelength ( 520 nm ) using a unique , highly non - linear optical fibre developed at the university of bath @xcite .",
    "a delay arm in the beam path is adjusted so that femtosecond pulses from both combs arrive at an avalanche photodiode simultaneously . the difference - frequency generated by interference of the green third harmonic comb and the frequency - shifted red comb ( both at 520 nm )",
    "contains the offset frequency .    although it is possible to feed this @xmath15 measurement back into the laser , thus actively stabilising @xmath15 , it was not necessary for the purposes of our lfc demonstration and ips measurement",
    "this minimized the equipment required at the remote aat site .",
    "because @xmath15 is not multiplied by @xmath10 ( unlike @xmath17 ) , it was easily logged and monitored with simple electronics during our experiments . in principle , this record could be used in post - processing to calibrate the comb , though for the purposes of our analysis in section [ sec : single ] , this was not necessary .",
    "one important characteristic of the frequency comb used here , as with all previous tests of lfcs on astronomical spectrographs , is that @xmath14 is too low for the teeth of the comb to be resolved from one another by the spectrograph ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , this was one challenge for the implementation of ` turn - key ' lfcs in astronomy discussed by @xcite .",
    "our lfc s repetition frequency , @xmath18mhz , is too low even for uhrf s highest resolution mode with @xmath19=940000 , i.e.  fwhm=0.4ghz .",
    "a simple solution employed in previous works is to filter out most modes using a fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity .",
    "we chose the fp cavity s free spectral range ( fsr ) to transmit only every 11th comb mode , leaving an effective mode separation of 1.03ghz  wide enough to resolve with uhrf . in designing the fp cavity it",
    "was firstly coupled to a continuous wave laser for end mirror alignment to form a stable cavity .",
    "for it to operate with the mode - locked laser a further condition must be satisfied , that is , every 11th ( in our case ) pulse must map back precisely onto itself , requiring a precision in the length of the cavity of order of a few wavelengths .",
    "one of the mirrors on the fp cavity was set on a fine - screw to obtain coarse cavity length tuning , and then the optical output was monitored and used to control the cavity length via a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) on the mirror .",
    "the dynamic range of linear response for astronomical ccds is limited to @xmath040000 photo - electrons , the ccd studied here being no exception .",
    "our lfc generally supplied more photons than required in short exposures ; each comb exposure only needed to be a few seconds long .",
    "therefore , individual exposures have very high , dominated by the lfc photon statistics , thereby enabling constraints on the ips variations .",
    "we are also able to test the stability of the spectrograph on short time - scales using a series of short exposures ( see section [ ssec : series_obs ] ) . by comparison , the usual wavelength calibration method  a hollow - cathode thar emission - line lamp  provides only 3 emission lines near 780 nm which provide only moderate  ( @xmath050per pixel ) even after several minutes of exposure .",
    "finally , we note that our lfc setup enables a simple method for ` flat - fielding ' ( dividing out the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations in ) the ccd exposures : we simply bypass the fp cavity to provide a high - intensity spectrum whose spectral structure is unresolved by uhrf .",
    "again , the usual flat - field calibration method , which utilizes a quartz lamp , would have involved averaging many exposures lasting several minutes each .",
    "the uhrf is a ( grating ) cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph mounted in the ( east ) coud room of the aat @xcite .",
    "it was selected for our lfc test because its very high resolution mode ( @xmath19=940000 ) allows us to use a relatively inexpensive , commercial lfc with a ` low ' ( actually typical ) @xmath14 .",
    "the demands on the finesse of the fp cavity mirrors ( which was @xmath20 ) are also reduced because ` only ' 10 out of every 11 comb modes need to be interferometrically suppressed .",
    "and while uhrf in this mode only allows @xmath01 nm of a single echelle order to be observed in a single exposure , a wider bandwidth was not required for measuring possible ips variations .",
    "also , pre - defined echelle and cross - disperser angles were already available for observing at 780 nm , so minimal time was spent configuring the spectrograph itself .",
    "the fp - filtered comb light was coupled into a single - mode optical fibre for transport to uhrf s pre - slit chamber where it was launched in free space through a rotating paper diffuser to over - fill the slit in the spectral direction and almost fill it in the spatial direction .",
    "the full uhrf resolving power of @xmath19=940000 was achieved by using the smallest slit - width possible , just 40@xmath8 m , or 0.059arcseconds projected on the sky .",
    "the slit had an unvignetted length of @xmath03.4 mm , or @xmath05arcseconds .",
    "the alignment of this simple launch setup was checked only by eye using a television camera system to view the 780 nm light falling on cards placed along uhrf s optical axis .",
    "the laser light ( almost ) filled the uhrf collimator symmetrically about its centre .",
    "the alignment was not altered throughout the exposure sequences reported in this paper .",
    "once the optical alignment of the launch system was finalised , the ccd dewar was manually rotated around the optical axis and fixed so that uhrf s spectral direction roughly aligned with the ccd rows .",
    "this simplified the analysis by ensuring that comb spectra from individual ccd rows spanned the entire length of the ccd .",
    "the ccd studied here , called ` mitll3 ' at the aat , is chip 2 from wafer 67 ( i.e.  device w76c2 ) of fabrication run ccid-20 from mit / lincoln labs .",
    "it has 2048@xmath214096 15@xmath2115-@xmath8 m pixels and was designed to have a deep depletion layer ( i.e.  high resistivity ) , yielding pixels which are effectively 40@xmath8 m thick .",
    "several trade - offs were considered in selecting the mitll3 chip over another commonly - used chip at the aat , a back - side illuminated , thinned eev chip with 2048@xmath214096 13.5@xmath2113.5-@xmath8 m pixels .",
    "the latter is used for precise radial velocity work at the aat ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which might benefit from knowing the ips variations in that device .",
    "nevertheless , chips from the same fabrication run ( ccid-20 ) as the mitll3 are used at many telescopes world - wide in many different instruments including , for example , the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph at the very large telescope , chile @xcite .",
    "another consideration is that , being thinned and back - side illuminated , the eev chip s ips variations may be larger and more easily detected by our lfc test .",
    "conversely , ips variations in the deep - depletion mitll3 chip might be harder to detect .",
    "however , the main factor in selecting the mitll3 chip was its very low fringing level at 780 nm . the much larger fringing level of the eev would have prevented adequate flat - fielding of our comb exposures and precluded any measurement of the ips variations in the eev chip .",
    "for reference , the mittl3 ccd pixel size in the spectral direction of 15@xmath8 m translates to 2.63m  or , at 780 nm , 129mhz or 101 .",
    "the nominal resolving power of @xmath22 at 780 nm translates to a fwhm resolution of 8.3m , 409mhz or 319 .",
    "the fwhm resolution is sampled by 3.15 pixels .      before any analysis of ips variations",
    ", only basic data - reduction steps were required .",
    "the bias level was estimated using the median of 51 zero - second ccd exposures and subtracted from each ccd exposure . as mentioned in section [ ssec : lfcdetails ] above , flat - field exposures were obtained by bypassing the fp cavity stage . a master flat - field , formed from the median of 31 such exposures with high photo - electron counts ,",
    "was used to normalize each lfc exposure used in our analysis .",
    "part of a bias - corrected , flat - fielded lfc exposure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] .",
    "note that the spectrum s spatial direction is tilted with respect to the ccd columns , a fact which assists our subsequent analysis .",
    "it is important that the error spectrum  the flux uncertainty in each ccd pixel  is estimated for our analysis of possible ips variations .",
    "the dominant noise source is the poisson noise of the lfc photons ; the ccd s read - noise was only @xmath03 photo - electrons per pixel .",
    "thus , the error spectrum varies strongly along the spectral direction of any given ccd row .",
    "an error image was generated for each bias - corrected , flat - fielded lfc exposure by taking the square root of the bias - corrected flux image and normalizing by the master flat - field image .",
    "the error spectrum is shown for a single ccd row in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] .",
    "to understand the extent of ips variations in the ccd pixels , we model the frequency comb flux using non - linear least squares @xmath23 minimisation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the reliability of this technique is demonstrated using simulated comb ccd recordings where relevant in the following sections .",
    "it is possible that other techniques would be effective , perhaps even simpler or faster but , for the demonstration purposes of this paper , a full exploration of other techniques is not important .",
    "the @xmath23 minimisation code is custom - written but employs the standard levenberg ",
    "marquardt method with an implementation following the basic structure of that set out in @xcite .",
    "we begin by modelling the uhrf instrumental line - shape ( or instrumental profile ) from the 1-dimensional comb spectrum in individual rows of the comb ccd exposures ( section [ ssec : ils ] ) .",
    "that model is constrained by the assumption that other observed spectrum properties ( e.g.  average flux , frequency dispersion per ccd pixel ) vary only slowly across the ccd .",
    "this basic model of the instrumental line - shape is then fixed ( though its parameters remain free ) and the ips variations are introduced to the comb model in section [ ssec : ips_1d ] .      for our purposes , the instrumental line - shape ( ils )",
    "is defined as the profile formed in a single ccd row by an infinitely narrow lfc mode after passing through the spectrograph .",
    "note that our lfc s modes are completely unresolved by uhrf and so each recorded comb mode will directly represent the ils at its observed wavelength .",
    "the frequency stability of our lfc implies that the spectral width of each comb mode is @xmath01mhz , or @xmath00.8  at the observed wavelength of 780 nm .",
    "given the nominal uhrf resolution of @xmath24320 , the comb modes are very much unresolved .",
    "for a single ccd row , we initially model the comb flux , @xmath25 ( in electron counts ) , in ccd pixel @xmath26 as the product of an ` envelope intensity ' function , @xmath27 , and a ` comb function ' , @xmath28 , both of which are functions of position in the spectral direction of the ccd , @xmath29 : @xmath30    the sensitivity of @xmath25 to ips variations is directly linked to the fact that the comb function varies quickly on the scale of a single ccd pixel , so it is important to integrate the model of the comb across the pixel rather than approximate it by taking , e.g.  its value at the pixel s centre .",
    "however , the envelope intensity of the comb , @xmath27  the variation in the measured peak intensity from mode to mode  varies very slowly along the spectrum ; the approximation in the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : fi ] ) reflects this .",
    "for all the fits conducted in this paper , @xmath27 is simply approximated as a second order polynomial .",
    "because the lfc modes are much narrower that the uhrf resolution , in equation ( [ eq : fi ] ) the comb function , @xmath28 , can be written as a sum of ilss from each comb mode , @xmath31 the @xmath10th mode of the comb transmitted through the fabry - perot cavity occurs at pixel position @xmath32 given by @xmath33 with @xmath34 the ` pixel - space repetition frequency ' . equation ( [ eq : xn ] ) is analogous to equation ( [ eq : fn ] ) but , because we model the comb in pixel space rather than frequency space , higher - order terms are required , characterised by @xmath35 , @xmath36 etc .. in this work we found no need to include terms beyond second order in equation ( [ eq : xn ] ) because we model such short frequency ranges of comb spectra .",
    "visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] reveals that comb modes fall on approximately every 8th pixel ",
    "i.e.  @xmath37pix  without any obvious non - linearity , i.e.  @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , in our detailed modelling below , @xmath35 is typically @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    visual inspection of the example comb spectrum recorded in a single ccd row ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] ) reveals uhrf s ils to be slightly asymmetric .",
    "our initial guess for the ils was therefore a double - gaussian model : a central gaussian flanked by a weaker second one with the same width .",
    "that is , @xmath41}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the ratio of gaussian amplitudes , @xmath44 , normalized so that @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ fig : fit_estils ] shows the model specified in equations ( [ eq : fi][eq : ilsgauss ] ) fitted to a small section of a single row of one comb exposure . also plotted is the same model but with a single gaussian ils instead of a double - gaussian ( i.e.  @xmath46 instead of 2 ) .",
    "the two models are not readily distinguishable by eye .",
    "however , the residual spectra clearly show that the double - gaussian model provides a closer match to the data .",
    "this is also reflected in the values of @xmath23 per degree of freedom , @xmath47 , for the two fits : @xmath48 and 2.7 for the single and double - gaussian models respectively .",
    "we discuss why the latter value is noticeably greater than unity in section [ ssec : results_indiv ] .",
    "the residual spectrum for the double - gaussian model , also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_estils ] , does not appear to show any features which repeat on the scale of the comb mode structure , unlike that for the single - gaussian model .",
    "we attempted to include a third gaussian ( i.e.  @xmath49 ) in the ils but its best - fitted amplitude was typically very small ( @xmath50 ) and , upon fitting different ccd rows and using different ccd exposures , its separation from the main gaussian component was sporadic and very weakly constrained .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of periodic structure in the residuals from the double - gaussian model in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_estils ] . also , including the third gaussian barely reduced @xmath51 in most cases ; when fitting some ccd rows from some exposures it actually increased .",
    "that is , there is no clear evidence for additional structure in the ils beyond the double - gaussian model .",
    "@xcite measured the uhrf ils using a he - ne laser . from their figure 10 ,",
    "their measured ils can be described as comprising two main gaussian - like components separated by @xmath00.25  with similar widths of @xmath52  and with one being @xmath2420per cent the height of the other .",
    "this accords well with the ils model derived from the comb spectra : in the simple fits above , the gaussian components were separated by @xmath240.23 , they had @xmath53  and the weaker one was @xmath54per cent the height of the stronger one .",
    "thus , the double - gaussian model of the uhrf ils seems well justified , both from the comb spectra themselves and the he - ne spectra of @xcite .    when fitting different parts of the same ccd exposure studied in figs .",
    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] & [ fig : fit_estils ] , and the others taken over the course of our lfc test , we found no significant variations in the ils structure .",
    "that is , no further gaussians seem to be required . nor do we observe large variations in the parameters of the two gaussians constituting our preferred ils model ; when modelling a 2-dimensional comb spectrum in section [ sec : single ] we explicitly test for this possibility .",
    "however , throughout this rest of this work we adopt the basic double - gaussian model of the ils with free parameters as specified in equation ( [ eq : ilsgauss ] ) .    finally , a by - product of the above fits is the statistical uncertainty on @xmath55 in equation ( [ eq : xn ] ) , the zero - point of the comb function .",
    "for example , the double - gaussian fit to the 150 spectral pixels in fig .  [ fig : fit_estils ] returns a 1-@xmath56 uncertainty on @xmath55 of @xmath57pix , or @xmath241 . in the absence of intra - pixel sensitivity variations ( which we seek to measure in this work )",
    ", this would correspond to the precision with which such short sections of the comb spectrum could be wavelength - calibrated .      in our comb test with uhrf we sought to detect or limit any ips variations only in the spectral direction across the ccd pixels .",
    "this is possible because the flux measured in a given pixel will depend on the ips variations most strongly when the comb flux changes substantially across a pixel . from the example",
    "comb exposure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] it is clear that the flux variations in the spatial direction are much more slowly varying compared with those in the spectral direction . therefore , we do not attempt to model or detect ips variations in the spatial direction across pixels .",
    "thus , when fitting the comb flux in a single ccd row , or part thereof , we insert a term for the ips map , @xmath58 , in equation ( [ eq : fi ] ) to obtain @xmath59 where , as discussed above , @xmath60 is the same for all @xmath26 , or @xmath61 .",
    "our aim here is to measure the average ips variations , not the ips map for individual pixels .",
    "the latter possibility is discussed in section [ sec : series ] .",
    "we therefore make two important assumptions in the modelling that follows :    1 .",
    "the ips variations in all ccd pixels under consideration are assumed to be the same .",
    "while previous laboratory studies have shown that ips variations are different in different pixels , they also demonstrate a high degree of correlation across large portions of the ccd ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ips variations are modelled as a symmetric function about the centre of the pixel ( in the spectral direction ) .",
    "we report results here from a gaussian function with variable width , truncated at the pixel edges and a base fixed at zero with no slope . for gaussian widths larger than @xmath62 pixels , which we find are always preferred for the uhrf ccd , a variable base would be closely degenerate with the width parameter . similar functions ",
    "e.g.  symmetric linear slopes away from a central ips peak ( or trough ) to the pixel edges  give very similar results .",
    "it is also important to realise that a variable baseline slope would be closely degenerate with the parameters in equation ( [ eq : xn ] ) which characterize the position of the comb modes .",
    "that is , a general slope in the ips map of the fitted pixels is not detectable in our work . we discuss this further in section [ ssec : series_sim ] .",
    "we will see in section [ ssec : results_indiv ] that it is only by fitting many hundreds of pixels ( all assumed to have the same ips map ) that the degeneracies in our fitted model are reduced to a level where the gaussian width of the ips model can be constrained .",

    "that the form of equation ( [ eq : fi_ips ] ) is convenient because the integrand is the sum of a product of gaussian functions , thereby allowing trivial numerical integration using the well - known gamma function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to measure the ips variations using a single ccd exposure we assume that they are the same in all pixels and utilise the fact that each pixel ( i.e.  `` copy '' of the ips map ) is probed with a different flux distribution . by using a well - constrained model of the flux distribution across many pixels , @xmath67  the gaussian width of the average intra - pixel sensitivity ( ips ) map in our model",

    "rather than attempt to fit many more pixels in a single ccd row , which may necessitate higher - order representations of the intensity envelope function , @xmath27 , and comb function , @xmath28 , we instead utilized the full 2-dimensional ( 2d ) comb information in our uhrf ccd exposures .      the example ccd exposure in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] illustrates how the comb signal occupies more than 100 pixels in the spatial direction .",

    "this means that , under our assumption that all ccd pixels have the same ips variations , we can fit many ccd rows simultaneously by adding a very small number of additional free parameters to the model in equation ( [ eq : fi_ips ] ) .",
    "firstly , each of the terms of the comb function in equation ( [ eq : xn ] ) now becomes a function of ccd row , @xmath71 .",
    "that is , the @xmath10th mode in row @xmath71 can be written as @xmath72 where we have now explicitly truncated the series at second order in @xmath10 and limited the order in @xmath71 in each term .",
    "figure [ fig : eg_2dcomb ] clearly shows that the spatial direction of the spectrograph is tilted with respect to the ccd columns , i.e.  @xmath73 to account for this tilt .",

    "that is , both @xmath74 and @xmath75 were consistent with zero .",
    "therefore , for all fits reported here we fixed @xmath74 and @xmath75 to zero .",
    "similarly , each of the parameters of the instrumental line - shape ( ils ) could vary with @xmath71 . by appropriately altering equation ( [ eq : ilsgauss ] ) to include polynomial dependence on @xmath71 for all free parameters ( e.g.  @xmath70 )",
    ", we explored various fits to search for evidence of this .",
    "however , we found no significant variations in the ils in the spatial direction .",
    "finally , note that while the intensity envelope function , @xmath76 , clearly varies ( slowly ) with ccd row , @xmath71 , it will not be strongly covariant with any ips variations , the measurement of which is our main aim .",
    "therefore , we simply allowed the parameters of @xmath27 to be independently determined for each @xmath71 .",
    "we searched for ips variations in our 10 highest snr ( 20-s long ) exposures . in each exposure we concentrated on fitting a 50@xmath21320pix ( rows@xmath21columns ) region near the centre ( highest snr ) of the comb signal .",
    "this represents about half the comb s spatial extent and about 10per cent of its spectral extent on the ccd .",
    "preliminary fits showed that some portions of the fitted area were not well flat - fielded . from inspection of the raw images and the master flat - field frame",
    ", we determined that dust particles on the uhrf optics were most likely resulting in small flat - field residuals which varied slightly from exposure to exposure or at least between the comb and flat - field exposures .",
    "the portions of the fitted area were the same in the 10 exposures we studied in detail .",
    "therefore , we simply masked these portions out of our @xmath23 minimization analysis .",

    "however , we did not observe any obvious correlation between the positions of these exceptions in different exposures .",
    "they may very well result from ips variations in small clusters of pixels , but we can not quantitatively address that possibility with the data in hand .",
    "again , we attempt here to constrain a model of the average ips variations for the whole fitted area .    for all of the 10 individual exposures , simply including @xmath78 as a free parameter in the fit yielded best - fit values @xmath79pix in all cases .",
    "this was independent of the starting guess for @xmath67 ( and other parameters in the model ) , which was generally @xmath00.5pix .",
    "in most cases @xmath78 grew from the starting guess value to @xmath80pix , the arbitrary limit imposed in our code . and in all cases , the best fit value was entirely consistent with @xmath81 .",
    "that is , under the assumptions of our ips model , we do not detect significant average ips variations .    to ensure that our @xmath23 minimization code was functioning correctly we fitted simulated versions of the 10 comb spectra .",

    "a fit to a simulated version of the same comb exposure with a flat ips map inserted yield very similar results ( red curve with triangular points ) .",
    "the green curve with square points shows the results from a fit to the same simulation in which a non - flat ips map was used , i.e.  @xmath90pix .",
    "the definite minimum demonstrates that non - flat ips variations could have been detected given the assumptions in our model of the comb exposures . ]    for the particular exposure studied in fig .  [",
    "fig : ipsresults ] we can rule out @xmath91pix ( @xmath92pix ) at the 68per cent ( 95per cent ) significance level .",
    "these constraints on @xmath67 were uniformly replicated for the same fitted region across the 10 exposures we studied in detail .",
    "by co - adding the plots of @xmath93 versus @xmath67 for all 10 exposures , and recalling that we fitted the same region of the ccd in all cases , we form a joint constraint on the gaussian width of our assumed ips variation map : @xmath94pix at 99.7per cent ( 3-@xmath56 ) confidence .",
    "this value of @xmath67 corresponds to variations in the ips across the spectral direction of the pixel of @xmath2per cent .    instead of a decrease in the ips from the pixel centre to its edges",

    "the snr of the simulated spectra again matched the corresponding real spectra .",
    "in all simulations the best - fit value of @xmath67 broadly matched the input value .",
    "this was simple to assess for input values @xmath98pix but judging formal statistical consistency between the input and best - fit values was more difficult when @xmath67 was larger .",
    "the ultimate reason for this is that the ips map is very flat for large @xmath67 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ipsresults ] which shows the variation in @xmath23 with fixed fitted values of @xmath67 for a single realisation with an input @xmath99 . in this example",
    "there is a clear minimum in @xmath23 near the input value of @xmath67 .",
    "however , it is also clear that @xmath23 s sensitivity to @xmath67 diminishes with increasing @xmath67 , i.e.  the @xmath23 curve is not parabolic at @xmath100",
    ". thus , the formal statistical error on @xmath67 derived from the covariance matrix in our @xmath23 minimization scheme will not be reliable for large @xmath67 .",
    "this problem clearly also applies to the constraints on @xmath67 derived from our real comb exposures above .",
    "this is the reason we used the @xmath23 curve for the fit to each exposure , rather than the formal error from the covariance matrix , to derive confidence limits on any ips variations .    to summarize the results above",
    ", we have demonstrated that any symmetric component of the average intra - pixel sensitivity ( ips ) variations can be detected in a single lfc exposure provided that many hundreds of pixels can be modelled simultaneously . the aat / mitll3 chip s average ips map deviates from being flat by @xmath2per cent in a symmetric manner about the pixel centre in the direction along ccd rows .",
    "however , under our model assumptions , we can not measure or rule out a significant asymmetric component to the average ips map .",
    "for example , the ips map may slope from one side of the pixel to the other , but we can not detect this by modelling a single exposure .",
    "the simple reason for this is that such a slope is closely degenerate with the measured position of the comb with respect to the ccd pixel grid .",
    "we return to this point in section [ ssec : series_sim ] . in the next section",
    "we discuss how a series of offset comb exposures might allow that degeneracy to be removed .",
    "with a view to detecting any very small average ips variations , the 10@xmath2120-s comb exposures with high  utilized in the previous section were taken in series with small offsets in the lfc signal applied between exposures .",
    "the offsets were generated by slightly altering the repetition frequency of the mode - locked laser , @xmath17 , which was observed to be stable between exposures .",
    "the offset in @xmath14 between each exposure was @xmath015hz so that the comb modes at 780 nm would shift by @xmath050 , or 0.5 spectral pixels .",
    "the carrier - envelope offset frequency , @xmath15 , was also monitored and fluctuations were negligible ( @xmath101 ) during the series of exposures .",
    "however , upon inspecting the series of offset comb exposures , it was apparent that the observed shifts in the comb modes did not accurately reflect those expected from the offsets applied to @xmath14 between successive exposures . to investigate this we took another series of 10 short ( 1-s ) exposures with no offsets in @xmath14 applied between them .",
    "that is , including the ccd read - out time of each exposure , a 1-s exposure was taken approximately every minute and , since neither @xmath14 nor @xmath15 changed appreciably during the 10min series , we expected no shifts between the comb modes .",
    "however , we discovered fairly large stochastic shifts between successive comb exposures . these were typically @xmath1020.2 pixels but some were as large as @xmath00.4 pixels .",
    "an example from 3 successive 1-s exposures is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shifts ] .",
    "furthermore , no two successive exposures had zero shift between them , indicating that the time - scale for these shifts is substantially less than 1min .    ) and carrier envelope offset frequency ( @xmath103 ) , yet they show clear , stochastic shifts of @xmath00.4 pixels . ]",
    "the origin of these shifts is not clear from our comb spectra , but the fast time - scale suggests that a purely thermal drift within uhrf is an unlikely culprit and that a more likely explanation is small mechanical oscillations or jumps / relaxations in the spectrograph .",
    "uhrf s main components and camera are mounted on a large ( @xmath03-m ) , vibration - damped and isolated bench .",
    "the slit assembly is mounted on the same bench .",
    "however , the pre - slit area upon which our lfc launch setup was mounted ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) is , at least in principle , decoupled from the spectrograph bench .",
    "thus , oscillations induced by moving components in the pre - slit area ( e.g.  the rotating diffuser ) should not cause the slit itself to oscillate .",
    "however , it remains possible the other equipment in the pre - slit area might transmit some vibrations to the slit assembly , which may have been responsible for the short time - scale , stochastic shifts we observe . if such oscillations / vibrations did not originate from our equipment",
    ", they may also affect astronomical observations with uhrf ; however , they are unlikely to have been detectable in uhrf before because of the much longer thar exposure times required ( i.e.  several minutes ) . observations with the university college london echelle spectrograph , ucles , which uses the same coud room and slit assembly as uhrf , might also be affected .",
    "we would be interested to learn whether users of ucles have identified such problems before , but to our knowledge they have not been reported in the literature .",
    "unfortunately , these stochastic shifts between exposures mean that we can not reliably model the observed series of offset comb exposures to constrain ips variations .",
    "one should consider whether the analysis of the individual 20-s exposures in section [ sec : single ] was affected by this instability .",
    "the effect of quickly varying shifts in the comb position , averaged over a comparably long exposure , should be to increase the observed comb mode width , or @xmath70 as parametrized in our comb models .",
    "we do not observe a larger @xmath70 for the 10@xmath2120-s comb exposures compared to the 10@xmath211-s ones : @xmath104 compared to @xmath105pix , respectively .",
    "however , the root - mean - square ( rms ) variations in these quantities  0.006 and 0.011pix , respectively  may be too large to detect the increase in width expected : if random comb shifts have @xmath106pix then @xmath70 would broaden by just @xmath00.01pix .",
    "even if this effect were present in the 20-s comb exposures , our model of the comb flux across the ccd pixels is still likely to be adequate and so the constraints on ips variations we derive are unlikely to be strongly affected .",
    "while the short time - scale instabilities in uhrf prevent us from constraining the average ips variations using a real series of offset comb exposures , we can nevertheless demonstrate this possibility using simulated comb spectra .",
    "we simulated 10 spectra , each with a single ccd row 320 pixels long .",
    "the comb signal was generated using the best - fitting parameters derived from row 750 of the ccd exposure studied in section [ ssec : results_indiv ] ( see figs . [",
    "fig : eg_2dcomb ] & [ fig : fit_estils ] ) , including the double - gaussian instrumental line - shape .",
    "gaussian random noise was added to each spectrum independently , with the average  set to the same value as in the real ccd exposure .",
    "however , we introduced 0.8-pixel offsets between the comb functions for successive spectra .",
    "we then simultaneously fitted comb functions to all 10 spectra , the key assumption being that the relative offsets between spectra were known ; if the lfc system is absolutely calibrated then this will be true to very high precision .",
    "figure [ fig : simips ] shows the results of the fits to the simulated spectra . similar to the simulations in the previous section , the input ips model was a gaussian with @xmath107pix centred at @xmath63 .",
    "that is , the gaussian was centred at the middle of the pixel and @xmath67 was a free parameter .",
    "note that the ils and envelope function parameters were also free in this fit .",
    "figure [ fig : simips ] shows that this symmetric ips model is recovered with a relatively small uncertainty in @xmath67 of 0.03pix .",
    "this demonstrates that a series of offset comb spectra can be used to characterise the symmetric component of the average ips map .    )",
    "shaded region shows the 1-@xmath56 uncertainty range in the measured ips map ( solid curve ) when only the gaussian width of the ips model is a fitted free parameter .",
    "the red ( asymmetric ) region and curves represent the results when both the gaussian ips width and its position along @xmath29 are free parameters and where it is assumed that the absolute position of the comb with respect to the ccd pixel grid is known . in both cases",
    "the input ips model is shown as a black dotted curve . ]",
    "the main reason a series of offset spectra can strongly constrain the ips variations , even with fairly few pixels ( e.g.  a single ccd row ) assumed to have the same ips map , is that the comb flux distribution across each pixel is changed by a known amount when the comb is offset by a known amount .",
    "however , as with the 2d analysis of a single exposure in section [ sec : single ] , any asymmetric component of the ips map is highly degenerate with the overall position of the comb .",
    "that is , without knowing where the comb modes fall with respect to the ccd pixel grid , asymmetries in the average ips map can not be reliably determined .",
    "if some additional information could be gained about where the comb light is striking pixels , perhaps by adjusting a physical mask in front of the ccd , then the same fitting technique could be used to recover asymmetries in the ips map .    as an example of this , we simulated another ten 320-pixel , single - row comb spectra in the same way as above but with an asymmetric input ips map , i.e.  a gaussian , as before , but shifted with respect to the pixel centre .",
    "it was then assumed that the absolute position of the comb modes with respect to the pixel grid was known .",
    "figure [ fig : simips ] shows that the fitting technique indeed recovers the asymmetry in the input ips model with high accuracy . much higher precision measurements of the average ips variations should be possible if the instrumental line - shape ( ils ) is also known accurately _ a priori _ ( or measured independently ) and not simultaneously constrained by the comb spectra . with a large enough number of high-  exposures with very small , known offsets , and with known comb - mode  ccd - grid positioning and ils information , it should be possible to measure the ips map of every illuminated ccd pixel .",
    "we reported the successful test of a laser frequency comb ( lfc ) system on the ultra high resolution facility ( uhrf ) spectrograph at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "figure [ fig : setup ] shows the experimental setup used .",
    "the high spectral resolution of uhrf ( @xmath108 ) allowed a commercial fibre laser with a fairly typical repetition frequency ( @xmath14 ) to be used .",
    "a fabry - perot cavity was used to widen the effective separation between modes to @xmath01ghz ( by suppressing 10 of every 11 modes ) so they could be resolved apart by uhrf .",

    "[ fig : eg_2dcomb ] .",
    "our main goal in the lfc test was to demonstrate that lfc spectra could be used to characterize the average intra - pixel sensitivity ( ips ) map of astronomical ccds _ in situ_. this meant that actively self - calibrating the lfc ( i.e.  controlling @xmath14 and @xmath15 , not just measuring / monitoring them ) was not necessary , which minimized the equipment required on - site .",
