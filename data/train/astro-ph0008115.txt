    "it is now well established that luminous matter makes up only a small fraction of the mass of the observed universe .",
    "the evidence for dark matter is both astrophysical and cosmological  @xcite .",
    "such evidence requires only that dark matter is gravitationally interacting .",
    "however , additional constraints , especially the success of light - element cosmonucleosynthesis calculations , strongly disfavor the possibility that dark matter is composed solely of baryons  @xcite , and so some form of matter foreign to our everyday world is required .",
    "the dark matter problem is therefore also an important problem for particle physics , as particle physics both suggests promising possibilities and imposes stringent constraints .",
    "neutralinos are well - motivated candidates to provide much or all of the non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "an effectively stable particle is a generic component of models with weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "this particle is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , and is typically the neutralino , a mixture of the superpartners of higgs and electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "particle physics considerations alone require the neutralino to be electrically neutral , effectively stable ( assuming @xmath0-parity conservation , which is also motivated by the need to forbid too - rapid proton decay ) , and weakly interacting , with mass of order 100 gev ( required , as we shall quantify below , if supersymmetry naturally protects the electroweak scale from large radiative corrections ) .",
    "remarkably , these properties are consistent with the possibility that the thermal relic density of neutralinos makes up most of the missing mass of the universe  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these properties also guarantee that neutralinos are practically impossible to observe in collider experiments directly .",
    "they pass through collider detectors without interacting .",
    "existing bounds on neutralinos therefore rely on model - dependent correlations between their properties and those of other supersymmetric particles . at present",
    ", in minimal supergravity , the lep experiments constrain @xmath1  @xcite . in the next several years , run ii of the tevatron at fermilab and , eventually , the large hadron collider at cern will provide more powerful collider probes .    if neutralinos make up a significant portion of the halo dark matter , many additional avenues for their detection open up .",
    "they may deposit energy as they scatter off nuclei in detectors .",
    "we have investigated the prospects for direct detection in a companion article  @xcite , where we emphasized the importance and promise of a mixed gaugino - higgsino regime , previously neglected . here",
    "we will study the possibility of detecting neutralinos indirectly by looking for evidence of their annihilation  @xcite . in the next five years",
    ", an astounding array of experiments will be sensitive to the various potential neutralino annihilation products .",
    "these include under - ice and underwater neutrino telescopes ( amanda , nestor , antares ) , atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( stacee , celeste , argo - ybj , magic , hess , cangaroo , veritas ) , space - based @xmath2 ray detectors ( agile , ams/@xmath2 , glast ) , and anti - matter / anti - particle experiments ( pamela , ams ) . in many cases",
    ", these experiments will improve current sensitivities by several orders of magnitude .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate the prospects for neutralino dark matter discovery through indirect detection .",
    "the neutralino signals depend on many unknown parameters . at the same time",
    ", an abundance of theoretical and experimental information from particle physics can be brought to bear .",
    "the implications of traditional particle physics searches for dark matter searches , and _ vice versa _ , are already significant , and promise to become much stronger over the next few years .",
    "one of our main conclusions is that in a class of particle physics models favored by current particle physics constraints , astrophysical signals are especially enhanced .",
    "previous discussions of indirect neutralino detection fall rather sharply into two schools .",
    "several previous works are based on specific high energy models  @xcite , including a number in the framework of minimal supergravity  @xcite .",
    "as we will recall below , minimal supergravity incorporates several desirable features , including the radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry and the possibility , suggested by gauge coupling unification  @xcite , of perturbative extrapolation to large energy scales .",
    "previous studies in minimal supergravity have concluded that only bino - like dark matter is allowed by particle physics constraints .",
    "such dark matter necessarily implies highly suppressed dark matter signals , as we will see .",
    "these studies , and their somber conclusions , have been criticized as products of overly restrictive particle physics assumptions  @xcite .",
    "recently we have argued more specifically that , even in minimal models , these studies failed to examine a very well - motivated regime of parameters , and that for this reason their conclusions are overly pessimistic  @xcite .    at the other extreme ,",
    "several studies scan over a large set of weak - scale supersymmetry parameters and consider values for these parameters as large as 50 tev .",
    "( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . ) these studies , and others , bring a high level of sophistication to the evaluation of astrophysical effects on dark matter signals . in this regard",
    ", we will have nothing to add , but we will incorporate many of the most accurate recent results in our study .    from a particle physics perspective , this second group of studies is impressively general , but this generality is achieved at a cost .",
    "for example , extrapolating a given set of weak - scale parameters to higher scales , one may encounter such diseases as landau poles or charge- or color - breaking minima . models of this sort do not arise within a reasonable high energy framework .",
    "in addition , there is the practical difficulty that the proliferation of free parameters implies that results can not be presented in a systematic , yet transparent , fashion .",
    "typically they are displayed as scatter plots after scanning over all parameters .",
    "it is nearly impossible , from such plots , to determine the dependence of the signal rates on the underlying physical parameters .",
    "dedicated correlation plots have been used to highlight a few of the relations between dark matter detection experiments , but even the most general implications of these experiments for collider searches , electric dipole moments , anomalous magnetic moments , proton decay , flavor violation , and other searches for supersymmetry are very hard to discern .",
    "finally , it can be expected that supersymmetry parameters , such as the @xmath3 and gaugino mass parameters , of order 50 tev will require fine - tuning of the order of 1 part in @xmath4 to produce the observed electroweak scale .",
    "( while it is impossible to speak of naturalness without first specifying a mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , at present all concrete models display this feature . )",
    "such large fine - tuning destroys one of the main motivations for considering supersymmetric extensions of the standard model in the first place .",
    "lacking both a systematic framework and a systematic presentation , it is impossible to see how the expectations narrow when some naturalness criterion is imposed",
    ".    it may be impossible to satisfy both schools simultaneously . however , recent results suggest an appealing compromise . as has been emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite , a bino - like lsp is _ not _ a robust prediction of minimal supergravity .",
    "we find that both bino - like and mixed gaugino - higgsino dark matter is possible .",
    "so simply by considering all of minimal supergravity parameter space carefully , as we will do here , we remove the most egregious form of model dependence . at the same time , by staying within the confines of minimal supergravity we will be able to present results in an organized and comprehensive manner , so that correlations with all other supersymmetric signals are easily determined . as the experiments discussed below report results , it will be ever more interesting to see what models are being excluded or favored .",
    "the framework discussed here makes this possible .",
    "inclusion of the new gaugino - higgsino lsp models in minimal supergravity is not just a formality .",
    "the region with mixed gaugino - higgsino lsps is now known to be robust and natural , given an objective definition of naturalness  @xcite .",
    "it yields cosmologically interesting relic densities  @xcite , and is even favored by low energy constraints such as proton decay and electric dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , _ all _ indirect detection signals are enhanced in this region .",
    "this lends increased interest to indirect dark matter searches , since large  possibly spectacular  rates are predicted within an attractive and simple high energy framework .    in the following section , we review a few essential results concerning neutralino dark matter in minimal supergravity with an emphasis on the new gaugino - higgsino lsp region .",
    "we then consider each of three promising signals in the following sections : upward - going muons from neutrinos in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutrinos ] , photons in sec .",
    "[ sec : photons ] , and positrons in sec .",
    "[ sec : positrons ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] we compare these to direct dark matter and traditional particle physics searches , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "the lightest neutralino is the lsp in many supersymmetric models . assuming @xmath0-parity conservation to prevent too - rapid proton decay through dimension - four operators , the lsp is effectively stable , and the neutralino is then an excellent candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "the signals of neutralino dark matter are determined in large part by their composition .",
    "neutralinos are mixtures of the superpartners of higgs and electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , these gauge eigenstates mix through the tree - level mass matrix    @xmath5    in the basis @xmath6 .",
    "the weak scale parameters entering this mass matrix are the bino , wino , and higgsino mass parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath3 , and the ratio of higgs scalar vacuum expectation values @xmath9 .",
    "the lightest neutralino mass eigenstate is then determined by these parameters to be some mixture @xmath10 we define the lsp gaugino fraction to be @xmath11 in the following , we refer to neutralinos with @xmath12 as gaugino - like , @xmath13 as mixed gaugino - higgsino , and @xmath14 as higgsino - like .",
    "the preceding discussion is model - independent , assuming only minimal field content .",
    "however , the minimal supersymmetric standard model is undoubtedly a low - energy effective theory of a more fundamental theory defined at some higher scale , such as the grand unified theory ( gut ) or string scale .",
    "a simple realization of this idea is the framework of minimal supergravity , which is fully specified by the five parameters ( four continuous , one binary ) @xmath15 here , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the universal scalar mass , gaugino mass , and trilinear scalar coupling .",
    "they are assumed to arise through supersymmetry breaking in a hidden sector at the gut scale @xmath19 .",
    "the hidden - sector parameters then determine all the couplings and masses of the weak scale lagrangian through renormalization group evolution .",
    "in particular , electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively by the effects of a large top quark yukawa coupling , and the electroweak scale is determined in terms of supersymmetry parameters through @xmath20 equation  ( [ mz ] ) receives corrections beyond tree - level ; in our work we include all one - loop effects in the higgs potential  @xcite .",
    "we also use two - loop renormalization group equations  @xcite with one - loop threshold corrections  @xcite and calculate all superpartner masses to one - loop  @xcite .",
    "all of the qualitative features to be described below are present , however , also for one - loop renormalization group equations .",
    "minimal supergravity is , of course , by no means the most general allowed framework .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the assumptions most relevant for dark matter , namely , the universality of gaugino and scalar masses , are motivated not only by their simplicity , but also by concrete experimental facts .",
    "the case for gaugino mass unification is especially powerful . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the three gauge couplings , when evolved to high scales ,",
    "meet with high precision at a point , the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "if the standard model is unified in a grand unified gauge theory , one typically obtains also gaugino mass unification .",
    "the unification of couplings calculation also distinguishes @xmath21 as the natural scale for a more fundamental framework .",
    "the unification of scalar masses is motivated by a similar , although more speculative , argument .",
    "consider the mass parameter @xmath22 , which , from eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) , plays the critical role in determining the weak scale for all moderate and large values of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . for theories with a universal scalar mass ,",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the renormalization group trajectories of @xmath22 for various initial conditions @xmath16 , when evolved to low scales , meet with high precision at a point , the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "this focusing , which requires that the top quark mass be within @xmath25 of its measured value , implies that the electroweak potential is highly insensitive to @xmath16 .",
    "the longstanding problems of supersymmetry with respect to cp violation , proton decay , etc . can therefore be ameliorated without fine - tuning , simply by assuming large scalar masses .",
    "although the focusing property holds more generally , its minimal and most concrete realization is in theories with a universal scalar mass .",
    "the assumption of a universal ( and large ) scalar mass is therefore motivated by the fact that it provides a simple and elegant solution to several well - known phenomenological problems of weak scale supersymmetry .    given these motivations for minimal supergravity , we now consider their implications for neutralino dark matter .",
    "gaugino mass unification implies @xmath26 .",
    "dark matter is therefore never wino - like , and in fact , throughout parameter space , @xmath27 .",
    "additional insights follow from re - writing eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) in terms of gut scale parameters . for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for example , @xmath30 where the numerical coefficients of the first two terms vary fractionally by @xmath31 in the @xmath32 plane  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath33 is highly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this is another expression of the focusing behavior discussed above , and implies that multi - tev values of @xmath16 do not involve significant large fine - tuning .",
    "the coefficient is also negative . for fixed @xmath17 , as @xmath16 increases",
    ", @xmath34 decreases , and the lsp becomes increasingly higgsino - like .",
    "this is important , because even a 10% higgsino admixture drastically affects the phenomenology . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mlsp ] and [ fig : gfrac ] we show the lsp mass and gaugino fraction in the @xmath32 plane . for large @xmath35",
    ", we find a region , previously ignored , where the lsp has a significant higgsino component .",
    "the green shaded regions are excluded by the requirement that the lsp be neutral ( top left ) and by the chargino mass limit of 95 gev ( bottom and right ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : mlsp ] and [ fig : gfrac ] , we also indicate the regions of cosmologically interesting relic densities ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "a generous range is @xmath36 , where the lower bound is the requirement that neutralino dark matter explain galactic rotation curves and the upper bound follows from the lifetime of the universe . above this shaded region , @xmath37 ; below , @xmath38 .",
    "the range @xmath39 is most preferred by current limits .",
    "our relic density calculation is not trustworthy in the black region , where there is a higgs scalar resonance , and very near to the left and right borders of the excluded region , where co - annihilation is important  @xcite . in the bulk of parameter space , however , these effects are negligible . for all @xmath23 ,",
    "cosmologically interesting densities are possible for @xmath40 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the cosmologically preferred region contains gaugino - higgsino dark matter .",
    "in contrast to @xmath16 , the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath3 enter eq .",
    "( [ mz2 ] ) with @xmath41 coefficients .",
    "naturalness therefore requires that the lsp mass ( and , in fact , the masses of all four neutralinos and both charginos ) should not be too far above the electroweak scale . while in principle it is possible that in some fundamental framework @xmath17 and @xmath3 are correlated precisely in a way that allows both parameters to be large without fine - tuning ( a possibility considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , no such framework has been found to date .",
    "barring such a possibility , extreme values such as @xmath42 require a fine - tuning of 1 part in @xmath4 and destroy one of the prime motivations for weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "we therefore regard such large values as highly disfavored , and we will focus on neutralino masses of order 100 gev .",
    "neutralinos annihilate through a variety of channels .",
    "the three leading processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : annih ] .",
    "( note that co - annihilation , while potentially important in determining relic densities in the early universe , is negligible now . )",
    "annihilation into gauge bosons is of particular importance , as these processes lead to more energetic and striking signals .",
    "the @xmath43 cross section relies on @xmath44 interactions .",
    "the only such couplings allowed by gauge invariance are @xmath45 and @xmath46 . however , as noted above , gaugino mass unification implies that the wino content of the lsp is always negligible .",
    "a large @xmath43 cross section is therefore possible only when the lsp has a significant higgsino component .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the @xmath47 process , where the @xmath48 interaction is possible only through @xmath49 couplings . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaugeboson ] , we see that the annihilation cross sections for @xmath50 and @xmath51 are indeed highly suppressed in regions with bino - like lsps , but are enhanced by three to four orders of magnitude in regions with mixed gaugino - higgsino dark matter .",
    "as we will see , this region , favored by low energy constraints , will be the most promising for all indirect signals .    before closing this section , we note several features of figs .  [",
    "fig : mlsp ] and [ fig : gfrac ] that will also apply to many of the following figures .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we present results for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and representative values of @xmath23 as indicated .",
    "@xmath18 governs the left - right mixing of scalars , and does not enter the neutralino sector .",
    "it is therefore largely irrelevant , especially in the regions of parameter space with observable signals  where , as we will see , the scalars are heavy and decoupled . , the 1999 lep bound on the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs boson @xmath55 barely constrains the parameter space shown in our figures , while the 2000 limit @xmath56 excludes the region with @xmath57 tev and @xmath58 gev .",
    "however , the higgs search is highly sensitive to the @xmath18 parameter . for other values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the current constraints may be evaded with negligible impact on our predictions for indirect dark matter detection .",
    "for this reason , we do not include the higgs mass constraints in the following analysis . ]",
    "( besides , the most important trilinear coupling , @xmath59 , has a weak - scale fixed point , and so is only weakly sensitive to @xmath18 . )",
    "our dark matter results are rather insensitive to the sign of @xmath3 , but the choice @xmath60 is motivated by the constraint from @xmath61 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , perturbativity of yukawa couplings limits @xmath23 to the range @xmath62 .",
    "low values of @xmath63 are now being excluded by the lep higgs search . in the remaining interval , models with moderate and high values may have qualitatively different behavior , as processes proportional to down - type yukawa couplings are enhanced by @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore typically present results for two representative values , one in each range .",
    "plots of many other quantities , including all physical slepton , squark , and higgs masses in the @xmath32 plane , including the high @xmath16 region , may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    finally , in the following three sections",
    ", we will _ not _ include the effects of variations in thermal relic density in our signal rates , but rather assume , for concreteness , a fixed local neutralino density .",
    "the results are then more transparent , and are applicable to general scenarios , such as those in which a late source of neutralino production is present .",
    "of course , in the simplest scenario , models with @xmath64 are excluded , and those with an under - abundance of neutralinos are disfavored and imply suppressed or negligible dark matter signals .",
    "this should be kept in mind in the following sections . in secs .",
    "[ sec : comp ] and [ sec : conclusions ] , we will combine all these considerations , and focus on the most preferred regions .",
    "when neutralinos pass through astrophysical objects , they may be slowed below escape velocity by elastic scattering . once captured , they then settle to the center , where their densities and annihilation rates are greatly enhanced .",
    "while most of their annihilation products are immediately absorbed , neutrinos are not .",
    "high energy neutrinos from the cores of the earth  @xcite and sun  @xcite are therefore promising signals for indirect dark matter detection .    the formalism for calculating neutrino fluxes from dark matter annihilation is well developed .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . )",
    "the neutrino flux depends first and foremost on the neutralino density , which is governed by the competing processes of gravitational capture and neutralino annihilation . if @xmath65 is the number of neutralinos in the earth or sun , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the capture rate and @xmath68 is the total annihilation cross section times relative velocity per volume .",
    "the present neutralino annihilation rate is then @xmath69 where @xmath70 gyr is the age of the solar system .",
    "captured neutralinos then annihilate through the processes of fig .",
    "( [ fig : annih ] ) .",
    "as @xmath71 is helicity - suppressed , neutrinos are produced only in the decays of primary annihilation products .",
    "typical neutrino energies are then @xmath72 to @xmath73 , with the most energetic spectra resulting from @xmath43 , @xmath47 , and , to a lesser extent , @xmath74 . after propagating to the earth s surface",
    ", neutrinos are detected through their charged - current interactions .",
    "the most promising signal is from upward - going muon neutrinos that convert to muons in the surrounding rock , water , or ice , producing through - going muons in detectors .",
    "the detection rate for such neutrinos is greatly enhanced for high energy neutrinos , as both the charged - current cross section and the muon range are proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "the calculation of muon fluxes from neutralino annihilation in the earth and sun is on reasonably firm footing , as it depends only on the local dark matter density and is insensitive to details of halo modeling . nevertheless , the calculation is involved , primarily as a result of complications in evaluating capture rates  @xcite and , in the case of the sun , in propagating the neutrinos from the core to the surface  @xcite . here",
    "we make use of the procedure of refs .  @xcite . for other analyses , see refs .",

    "[ fig : fluxe ] and [ fig : fluxs ] .",

    "the second is the angle @xmath91 between the neutrino and its daughter muon .",
    "as @xmath92 , @xmath93 is typically the dominant effect .",
    "the flux limits listed are for half - cone sizes of @xmath94 , corresponding roughly to @xmath82 .",
    "heavier neutralinos will produce more collimated muons , allowing smaller cone sizes with reduced backgrounds .",
    "the improved limits for smaller cone sizes may be found in the references .",

    "such sensitivities are typically not sufficient to discover bino - like lsps , unless they are light and @xmath23 is large .",
    "but they have an excellent opportunity to detect dark matter in the mixed gaugino - higgsino dark matter scenarios , which , as we have emphasized above , are preferred by low energy particle physics constraints .",
    "muon energy thresholds , listed in table  [ table : nt ] , are not included in figs .",

    "some of the preferred region escapes all probes , but this requires @xmath268 and @xmath269 , and requires significant fine - tuning of the electroweak scale . in the most natural regions , all models in which neutralinos form a significant fraction of dark matter will yield some signal before the lhc begins operation .",
    "also noteworthy is the complementarity of traditional particle physics searches and indirect dark matter searches .",
    "collider searches require , of course , light superpartners .",
    "high precision probes at low energy also require light superpartners , as the virtual effects of superpartners quickly decouple as they become heavy .",
    "thus , the lep and tevatron reaches are confined to the lower left - hand corner , as are , to a lesser extent , the searches for deviations in @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "these bounds , and all others of this type , are easily satisfied in the focus point models with large @xmath16 , and indeed this is one of the virtues of these models . however , in the focus point models , _ all _ of the indirect searches are maximally sensitive , as the dark matter contains a significant higgsino component .",
    "direct dark matter probes share features with both traditional and indirect searches , and have sensitivity in both regions .",
    "it is only by combining all of these experiments , that the preferred region may be completely explored .",
    "finally , these results have implications for future colliders . in the cosmologically preferred regions of parameter space with @xmath272 , all models with charginos or sleptons lighter than 300 gev will produce observable signals in at least one experiment .",
    "this is evident for @xmath29 and 50 in figs .",
    "[ fig : reach10 ] and [ fig : reach50 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach400 ] , we vary @xmath23 , fixing @xmath17 to 400 gev , which roughly corresponds to 300 gev charginos .",
    "we see that the preferred region is probed for any choice of @xmath23 .",
    "( for extremely low @xmath23 and @xmath16 , there appears to be a region that is not probed .",
    "however , this is excluded by current higgs mass limits for @xmath52 .",
    "these limits might be evaded if @xmath18 is also tuned to some extreme value , but in this case , top squark searches in run ii of the tevatron will provide an additional constraint . )",
    "these results imply that if any superpartners are to be within reach of a 500 gev lepton collider , some hint of supersymmetry must be seen before the lhc begins collecting data .",
    "this conclusion is independent of naturalness considerations .",
    "while our quantitative analysis is confined to minimal supergravity , we expect this result to be valid more generally . for moderate values of @xmath23 ,",
    "if the dark matter is made up of neutralinos , they must either be light , bino - like , or a gaugino - higgsino mixture .",
    "if they are light , charginos will be discovered .",
    "if they are bino - like , light sfermions are required to mediate their annihilation , and there will be anomalies in low energy precision measurements . and",
    "if they are a gaugino - higgsino mixture , at least one indirect dark matter search will see a signal . for large @xmath23 ,",
    "low energy probes become much more effective and again there is sensitivity to all probe superpartner spectra with light superpartners .",
    "thus it appears , on qualitative grounds , that all models in which the scalar masses are not widely separated , and the charginos are not extravagantly heavy , will be accessible prior to lhc operation .",
    "in this paper , we have examined a wide variety of indirect dark matter detection signals .",
    "these include neutrinos from annihilation of dark matter in the cores of the earth and sun , continuum gamma rays from annihilation in the galactic center , and positron excesses in cosmic rays from annihilation in the local solar neighborhood . in each case",
    ", the experimental landscape will be transformed in the next few years by experiments that are running or being mounted .",
    "we have tabulated the salient features and reaches of some of the most promising experiments in the previous sections .",
    "we have evaluated the prospects for dark matter detection in the framework of minimal supergravity .",
    "this framework incorporates many of the most compelling features of supersymmetry .",
    "previously , this framework has been thought to predict a bino - like lsp . that severely limited its utility for dark matter studies .",
    "however , recent work has made it clear that gaugino - higgsino mixtures and even higgsino - like lsps are also quite naturally realized in minimal supergravity .",
    "we have been careful to include the full range of possibilities , with important ( and positive ) implications for future dark matter searches .",
    "let us note in passing that in our parametrization of experimental probes , the case of no - scale supergravity  @xcite , recently revived in the context of gaugino - mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , can be regarded as the special case @xmath273 .",
    "experimental probes of these models are simply evaluated by restricting to the @xmath273 axis .",
    "several experiments , notably the trilepton tevatron search , direct dark matter searches , and brookhaven experiment e821 will have the power to confirm or exclude this possibility in the near future",
    ".    we have concentrated here on discovery signals .",
    "if a signal is confirmed , precision measurements may allow experiments to determine dark matter properties .",
    "for example , as has been noted in the literature , the neutralino s mass may be determined by the angular spread of the signal in neutrino telescopes .",
    "the energy spectrum of gamma rays or positrons signals may provide similar information .",
    "the gaugino - ness may also be constrained ; indeed , the existence of a significant signal in itself would constitute evidence in favor of mixed gaugino - higgsinos .",
    "the simplicity of minimal supergravity allows us to compare the reaches of a great variety of probes .",
    "we summarize by collecting several of our main conclusions :    * bino - like dark matter leads to suppressed rates for all indirect dark matter signals . in this case , unless the neutralino is extremely light ( near current bounds ) , all indirect signals are beyond detection for the foreseeable future .",
    "* higgsino - like dark matter can not yield cosmologically interesting relic densities in a straightforward way .",
    "studies that assume higgsino - like dark matter exaggerate the power of indirect searches . * mixed gaugino - higgsino dark matter gives both relic densities in the preferred range @xmath274 and detectable signals .",
    "such dark matter is naturally present in focus point models , which are favored by low - energy constraints . *",
    "experiments that are running or underway will transform the prospects for indirect dark matter detection . among the most promising experiments",
    "are the neutrino telescopes amanda , nestor , and antares ; the gamma ray telescope magic , and the satellite detector glast ; and ams-02 , the anti - particle / anti - matter search aboard the international space station . for mixed gaugino - higgsino dark matter",
    ", these experiments will be sensitive to nearly all models with cosmologically interesting neutralino relic densities , and are competitive with next - generation direct search experiments , such as cdms ( soudan ) and cresst . *",
    "the various indirect searches rely on different sources of neutralino annihilation ( cores of the earth or sun , galactic center , local solar neighborhood ) and so are sensitive to different assumptions .",
    "in addition , some signals , particularly the continuum photons , will be difficult to identify unambiguously as a dark matter signal .",
    "without actual data and detailed analyses , it is difficult to make a more precise statement .",
    "however , we have seen that many experiments are sensitive to the same supersymmetric models , and given the underlying uncertainties , redundancy is clearly a virtue . *",
    "indirect searches are complementary to traditional particle searches",
    ". separately they probe only portions of the cosmologically preferred model space .",
    "combined , essentially all cosmologically preferred models will produce at least a hint of a signal in one of these experiments _ before _ the lhc begins operation . * in minimal supergravity models with @xmath275 , _",
    "if there is no hint of supersymmetry before the lhc begins operation , no superpartners will be within reach of a 500 gev lepton collider_. our arguments are independent of naturalness considerations , and their qualitative structure suggests that similar conclusions will remain valid in alternative frameworks .",
