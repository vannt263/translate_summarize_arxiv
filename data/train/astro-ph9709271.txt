    "temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) can be considered one of the best probes of the early universe . the higher precision measurements that will become available in the near future",
    "could potentially lead to a precise determination of a large number of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "but the temperature anisotropies are not the only source of information , thomson scattering of the cmb photons will lead to a small degree of linear polarization at a level detectable by the future generation of experiments .",
    "the detection of polarization will provide information about our universe that is not available in the temperature data .",
    "for example it can provide an accurate determination of the ionization history of the universe @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves and vector modes also leave a specific signature in the polarization @xcite . the correlation function of the stokes parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be used to test the causal structure of our universe and thus provides a direct test of inflation @xcite .",
    "the polarization power spectra produced by the current family of topological defect models are also very different from that produced by inflationary models @xcite .    the two future satellite missions , map and planck , will measure polarization as well as temperature anisotropies .",
    "the extra information in polarization will help improve the constraints these missions can put on cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "for most parameters the expected error bars decrease by a factor of two and for those related to the reionization history of the universe the accuracy can be several times better .",
    "several ground based polarization experiments are now also under way .",
    "some of these experiments plan to measure the stokes parameters in pixels on a ring around the north celestial pole , which simplifies the pointing of the telescope .",
    "the properties of the experiment being developed at wisconsin university @xcite are discussed in detail .",
    "this experiment will concentrate on large angular scale polarization measuring both @xmath4 and @xmath5 in a @xmath2 ring .",
    "we also consider another example , an experiment that measures only one stokes parameter in a @xmath3 ring .",
    "recent theoretical developments @xcite have shown that rather than describing polarization in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath5 it is more natural to introduce two scalar quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the correlation functions of this variables is what theories most easily predict and the treatment in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 takes full account of the spin @xmath6 nature of polarization .",
    "the ring like polarization experiments appear as an ideal testing ground for this new formalism because they are being performed right now and also because their simple geometry will enable us to study them in full detail and build intuition on this new polarization formalism .",
    "we will study for example how this kind of experiments can separate the two components of polarization @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our treatment will also permit us to explore how changes of the experimental set up , like a change of the ring size , affect the experiments ability to detect cosmological polarization .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in  2 we review previous results on polarization and describe the way in which general polarization experiments can be analyzed . in ",

    "this is similar to what happens if one is interested in separating the contributions from density perturbations and gravitational waves to the temperature anisotropies .",
    "it is only when one _ assumes _ a shape for the power spectra that one can fit the observed temperature spectra as a sum of these two separate contributions and infer the presence of gravity waves . in a similar way",
    "if we only measure @xmath109 and we _ assume _ different shapes for both @xmath111 and @xmath112 we could determine each contribution . on the other hand if both stokes parameters are measured then we could separate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 contribution directly as they enter differently in each correlation ( multiplied by @xmath113 and @xmath114 in @xmath4 and the other way around in @xmath5 ) .    another interesting property of equation ( [ signalcorr ] )",
    "is that the @xmath115 @xmath4 mode does not receive any contribution from the @xmath1 channel because @xmath116 , the converse is true for @xmath5 .",
    "for example a non zero signal in @xmath117 implies the presence of @xmath1 and thus of gravity waves or vector modes .",

    "we will choose @xmath120 , corresponding to a receiver noise of @xmath121 and three weeks of observations .",
    "this numbers are chosen to be representative of what a ground experiment might achieve .",
    "the correlation matrix is @xmath122 both signal and noise parts are diagonal and we have introduced the window functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 which describe how each fourier mode depends on the underlying power spectra .",
    "let us consider what the experiment would measure if the underlying cosmological model was standard cdm .",
    "we will assume there are no gravity waves or vector modes so we will only consider @xmath0 type polarization .",
    "we will generalize our analysis later .",
    "[ figure1 ]    figure [ figure1 ] shows the window functions @xmath125 for several values of @xmath88 .",
    "only multipoles @xmath126 contribute to fourier component @xmath88 .",
    "as @xmath127 grows the peaks of the window functions move to higher @xmath128 ( we only show results for the @xmath129 modes but they also apply to the @xmath130 ones ) .",
    "the window functions are very broad in @xmath128 space , because their width is inversely proportional to the smallest dimension of the sky patch one is observing . for large values of @xmath128",
    "the window functions are cut off by the effect of the beam smearing , @xmath131 .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] also shows that the most important contribution to the signal in this experiment comes from the second polarization acoustic peak at @xmath132 , the first peak at @xmath133 contributes to a smaller extent .",
    "higher peaks are inaccessible because of beam smearing .",
    "an interesting point to note is that the @xmath134 window function peaks at low @xmath128 ( the lowest @xmath128 in the polarization expansion is by definition @xmath135 ) , so it is this mode rather than @xmath115 or @xmath50 that gets the contribution from the largest angular scale perturbations . to understand why let us consider a small patch of the sky containing the @xmath118 ring and a polarization field that is constant over the patch .",
    "this polarization field is produced by the very large angular scale perturbations , the low @xmath128 modes . without loss of generality",
    "let us call @xmath136 the direction of the polarization vectors , @xmath137 will be perpendicular to that .",
    "the stokes parameters are measured relative to the @xmath138 basis which rotates as one moves along the ring .",
    "although the polarization amplitude @xmath139 is constant over the whole patch and the direction is always @xmath136 the stokes parameters along the ring ( measured in the @xmath138 basis ) are given by @xmath140 and thus the @xmath141 fourier modes will get all the signal .",
    "the coordinate system used to describe the stokes parameters , which is rotating as one moves along the ring , and their spin 2 nature , which tells us how @xmath4 and @xmath5 transform under this rotation , makes the large angular scale perturbations contribute only to the @xmath141 mode .",
    "this is another illustration of the spin 2 nature of polarization .",
    "[ figure2 ]    another interesting thing to consider is the effect of the size of the ring on the window functions .",
    "the window functions are oscillating functions of @xmath128 and changes in the ring size modify the period of these oscillations .",
    "in particular the separation between peaks scales as @xmath142 , and at the same time as the peaks become more separated they also become broader .",
    "this is most easily understood in the small scale limit .",
    "if we can neglect the curvature of the sky , which is an excellent approximation for this experiment , we can use fourier transforms instead of spherical harmonics and write @xcite @xmath143 where @xmath144 labels the fourier mode with @xmath145 .",

    "the effect of changing the size of the ring is straight forward to understand in this expression , each @xmath125 is only a function of @xmath150 so changes in @xmath76 just cause a stretching of the window function .",

    "beam smearing only adds a @xmath155 to the expressions of both @xmath156 .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows two examples of these window functions for two ring sizes , the effect of scaling together with the @xmath155 factor is clear .",
    "[ figure3 ]    in figure [ figure3 ] we show the s / n for each of the fourier modes , that is the ratio of the signal to the noise part of the correlation in ( equation [ corrprinc ] ) , as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "as expected the signal to noise decreases with increasing @xmath88 because of beam smearing .",
    "the effect of decreasing the ring size is evident in the figure , because the window functions for successive @xmath88 become more separated and at the same time broader the signal in the experiment gets concentrated in fewer fourier modes .",
    "also note that there is a peak at @xmath157 when the ring is @xmath118 because this window function just matches the second acoustic peak and is then able to pick more power .",
    "the position of this peak is shifted to lower @xmath88 when the size of the ring is decreased .",
    "it is important to recognize that most modes have a @xmath158 smaller than one , which will make the polarization hard to detect .",
    "other models different from scdm would produce a higher signal , but reducing the noise in the experiment would crucially improve its sensitivity to cosmological polarization . on the other hand the overall s / n of the experiment not just mode by mode is better , opening the possibility that cosmological polarization will be detected in the near future with this type of experiments .",
    "let us now consider the wisconsin experiment , because it will actually measure both @xmath4 and @xmath5 on the ring it is in principle capable of distinguishing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarizations . the ring will be @xmath159 , scanning the sky on the vertical at wisconsin .",
    "it will have @xmath160 and @xmath161 , the experiment is thus sensitive to large scale polarization .",
    "unfortunately the large scale polarization is very small in most cosmological models for the sensitivity of this experiment .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows some of the window functions for the experiment with @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "note that the window functions for the cross correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 can actually be negative .",
    "the properties of these window functions are the same as those discaused above for the small scale experiment , but note that because both the ring and the beam are much bigger now , the experiment is only sensitive to @xmath165 .",
    "we will illustrate the features of this experiment by considering different underlying toy models , for simplicity we will take the power per logarithmic interval of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be constant , @xmath166 .",

    "for comparison we also show what is expected for scdm with an optical depth due to reionization @xmath168 .",
    "note that even for this large optical depth the expected signal to noise is very small .",
    "the smaller @xmath88 modes have smaller s / n in the @xmath169 model than in the flat spectra model because large scale polarization power spectra decreases rapidly with @xmath128 in all realistic models . in figure [ figure4 ]",
    "we also show the @xmath0 spectra for a model with @xmath169 .",
    "all models where the universe reionizes at an early enough epoch have a peak in the large angular scale polarization spectra @xcite . for this model @xmath170 and in general @xmath171 with @xmath172 the redshift at which the universe reionizes .",
    "we can see that the window function of the experiment are more sensitive to larger angular scale polarization and thus although the peak of the @xmath169 model has an amplitude of @xmath173 the flat spectrum model with amplitude @xmath174 produces a higher s / n for most @xmath88 .",
    "[ figure5 ]    the experiment can only detect cosmological polarization for extreme models with a very early reionization . on the other hand it has the virtue of being able to put separate constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 because it measures both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is the feature of the experiment that we are most interested in .",
    "we will analyze simplified models with constant power spectrum for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this will allow us to study what kind of constraints a ring experiment can put on @xmath0 and @xmath1 separately , not relying on the different shapes of these two contributions .",
    "the approximation also makes visualization of the results easier and it is also straight forward to get results for any other noise level , one just needs to rescale the values of @xmath175 accordingly .",
    "a useful way of characterizing the amount of information a given experiment can provide is through the fisher matrix . if one is interested in constraining a set of parameters @xmath176 , the fisher matrix is defined to be @xmath177 \\nonumber \\\\ { \\bf a}_i={\\bf c}^{-1}{\\partial { \\bf c }",
    "\\over \\partial s_i}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example the minimum error bars that can be obtained on a given parameter is @xmath178 .",
    "the fisher matrix can be used to construct minimum variance quadratic estimators for the different parameters @xcite , @xmath179 these estimators also have the virtue of being unbiased , @xmath180 .",
    "the estimator depends on the parameters one intends to estimate through the correlation matrix so some iterative approach may be needed to implement this method .",
    "this procedure can be seen as an iterative way of maximizing the likelihood @xcite . on the other hand a reasonable choice of underlying spectrum usually leads to a good estimator which has a slightly higher variance than could be achieved if the `` correct '' underlying model was used to build the estimator .",
    "perhaps a more important problem is that one also makes a mistake in the error bars of the estimator which could lead to errors in the subsequent determination of cosmological parameters from the data .",
    "we will discuss this further in the following section .",
    "let us start with the simplest application of these formulas .",
    "let us imagine that we are only interested in determining one parameter from the small ring experiment , we will assume that the shape of the spectrum is given and that we want to obtain an amplitude",
    ". we will parametrize the power spectrum as @xmath181 , @xmath182 is a fiducial spectrum which might be for example scdm . the correlation matrix and its derivative are then , @xmath183 where we have defined @xmath184 .",
    "note that @xmath185 is both a function of the experimental set up , ie .",
    "the ring and beam size and of the fiducial cosmological model .",
    "[ figure6 ]    as we are only estimating one parameter the fisher matrix is just a number ( @xmath186 ) , @xmath187 we can use this fisher `` matrix '' to obtain the expected error bars on @xmath54 , @xmath188 this can be interpreted as saying that the effective number of modes contributing informations is @xmath189 , where clearly the modes with a higher signal to noise contribute more information ( @xmath190 )",
    ".    we can use equation ( [ errorprinc ] ) to investigate the effect of changing the size of the ring @xmath76 , which enters which enters in the calculation of @xmath185 .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] shows @xmath191 as a function of @xmath76 for three cosmological models .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization spectra of these models is shown in figure [ figure7 ] , we choose standard cdm ( scdm ) and two other models that fit well the available temperature data @xcite .",
    "one is an open model with @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the other is a flat cdm model with @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "it is interesting to note that while this two models have similar temperature spectrum up to the first acoustic peak , within the accuracy of the current cmb measurements , the amplitude of the polarization spectra differ significantly .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] shows that this experiment may be able to detect polarization in the foreseeable future , at least for some cosmological models .",
    "increasing the sensitivity by reducing the noise and the angular resolution , thus going after the larger small scale polarization , will increase the prospects of the experiment as well .",
    "[ figure7 ]    the quadratic estimator for beta also takes a very simple form , @xmath198 which is nothing more than an inverse variance weighing of each mode .",
    "it is straight forward to check that the ensemble average of @xmath199 is actually @xmath54 ( @xmath200 ) , it is an unbiased estimator .    in this very simple example",
    "we can understand what happens if we construct the estimator using the `` wrong '' power spectra .",
    "let us assume that the underlying model is scdm model ( ie . that the underlying @xmath201 so that @xmath202 ) but that we use a different @xmath54 to construct the estimator .",
    "the first thing that is easy to check is that @xmath203 always , the estimator is always unbiased even if we use the incorrect @xmath54 to construct it .",
    "what happens is that the variance of the estimator increases if use the incorrect fiducial model , the variance in the estimator is given by @xmath204 ^ 2}\\ ] ] this function is shown in figure [ figure8 ] , the variance has a minimum at @xmath201 .",
    "if one chooses an incorrect value of @xmath54 the estimator is still unbiased but is not optimal , one could get more information out of the data ( ie .",
    "reduce the error bars on @xmath54 ) .",
    "note that the if @xmath205 which means we are overestimating the power in the underlying model by a factor of 2 , the variance only increases by a few percent .",
    "even for @xmath206 the increase is less than 10 % .",
    "the curves in figure [ figure8 ] depend on the signal to noise ratio of the experiment , for example the open model curve grows more slowly than the other two .",
    "this model has less power so more of the variance in the estimator comes from the detector noise and so it is less sensitive to the fiducial model .",
    "[ figure8 ]    unfortunately life is not so simple , it is not true that all the models we are interested in testing have a spectrum of the form @xmath207 as is obvious from figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "the open and flat models were chosen to fit the existing temperature data @xcite , this means that their first acoustic peak is approximately in the same place and is approximately of the same height .",
    "the acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid are responsible for both temperature and polarization peaks so if the temperature peaks of two models coincide in position , the polarization ones will also coincide .",
    "they not necessarily have the same amplitude , as can be seen in figure [ figure7 ] . to get the best results in this type of analysis we should choose @xmath207 with @xmath182 corresponding to one of the models that fit the existing temperature data . perhaps polarization can even help distinguish between some of these models before smaller scale temperature measurements do .",
    "in fact if we construct the quadratic estimator under the assumption that the underlying model is the open one , the mean value of @xmath54 if the real model is the flat one is @xmath208 , figure [ figure9 ] compares @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the agreement is very good especially for the s / n curves for the two models , which is what the experiment is ultimately sensitive to .    in any case @xmath54",
    "should be taken just as an indication of the power in polarization , and because this experiment is sensitive to such a wide range in @xmath128 it is better to assume some realistic spectrum shape given that the low @xmath128 polarization is so suppressed .",
    "if we do not do so and just assume a flat spectrum the weighing of the @xmath88 modes in @xmath199 will be very bad , leading to an estimator with a very large variance .",
    "of course one could divide the @xmath128 range in many bins so that the flat approximation in each bin is reasonable , but the s / n in the experiment does not permit that yet . the best way to go is to assume a shape for the spectrum corresponding to some model that fits the existing temperature data well .",
    "[ figure9 ]      let us now consider the wisconsin experiment , with the assumption that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra are constant , the correlation matrix for each @xmath88 is @xmath211 where @xmath212 for @xmath213 or @xmath214 and @xmath215 is the identity matrix .",
    "note that there is a symmetry between @xmath216 and @xmath65 , that is to say interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 leaves equation ( [ wisccorr ] ) unchanged .",
    "consider for example the previous signal to noise plot for a model with @xmath167 and no @xmath1 ( figure [ figure5 ] ) . in the `` conjugate '' model",
    "having @xmath217 and no @xmath0 , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 signal to noise plots would just be interchanged .",
    "the signal to noise plots for both parameters are different so at least in principle the @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributions can be separated .",
    "[ figure10 ]    we have two parameters so the fisher matrix is @xmath106 .",
    "we used it to compute the expected error bars on @xmath218 and @xmath219 in a grid of underlying models .",
    "contour plots of the error bars are shown in figure [ figure10 ] .",
    "one interesting feature of these plots is that because of the symmetry discussed above both figures are essentially the same , one can go from one to the other by simply interchanging the axis .",
    "the other feature that deserves attention is that for a fixed value of one of the amplitudes , for example @xmath218 as one increases the other one ( @xmath219 ) the error bar on @xmath218 grows .",
    "what happens is that the determination of both amplitudes is highly correlated , and always the combination that is better constrained tends to be more aligned with the variable with the highest amplitude .",
    "we show the error ellipses in the @xmath220 plane for two models in figure [ figure11 ] .",
    "the first model has @xmath221 and @xmath222 , the second one @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "clearly because of the @xmath225 symmetry in the correlation matrix if the underlying model has @xmath226 the sum of both amplitudes ( ie .",
    "the total power ) is much better constrained than their difference .",
    "when we consider a model with more power in the @xmath0 channel the ellipses rotate so that @xmath218 is better constrained than @xmath219 .",
    "[ figure11 ]    in figure [ figure12 ] we show the error bars expected for @xmath218 under the assumption that @xmath227 , that is models that lay on the x - axis of figure [ figure10 ] .",
    "we show two curves , one correspond to trying to determine both @xmath218 and @xmath219 and the other _ assumes _ we know there is no @xmath1 polarization .",
    "this is actually a good approximation for most models , only defect models that usually have a large vector contribution have a large @xmath1 contribution .",
    "these models do not seem to be in very good accord with the existing cmb and lss data @xcite .",
    "this experiment would be able to detect the cosmological polarization in an underlying model with @xmath228 . a model with @xmath169",
    "could be detected , but this model has most of its large angular scale power outside the band where the experiment is most sensitive .",
    "the `` reionization peak '' in this case occurs at @xmath170 with an amplitude @xmath229 , thus a smaller beam would greatly increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the reionization history of the universe , making the experiment better `` tunned '' for the position of the peak in @xmath128 space .",
    "it is also clear that a ring experiment can put independent constraints on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 separately if it measures @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "although the assumption that the spectrum is flat across all the band is not very good in this case , if the noise in the experiment was reduced then several bins in @xmath128 could be used and our analysis would become more realistic .",
    "[ figure12 ]",
    "we have studied in detail polarization experiments that measure the stokes parameters on a ring in the sky .",
    "we have shown that the fourier transform of the stokes parameters on the ring provides natural variables to analyze the results of the experiment , and have studied how the correlation matrix of this quantities depend on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power spectra .",
    "we calculated the window functions and discussed how it depends on the size of the ring .",
    "experiments that measure both stokes parameters are capable of determining separately the contributions from both @xmath0 and @xmath1",

    "in fact for @xmath115 the @xmath4 mode only depends on @xmath0 while the @xmath5 mode is only sensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "we have calculated the fisher matrices for these experiments and used them to estimate their ability to detect the amplitude of cosmological polarization .",
    "we also constructed the minimum variance quadratic estimator for the parameters of interest and studied their properties in detail    an experiment targeted at small scale polarization measuring the stokes parameters in a small ring with a fraction of a degree resolution , may detect cosmological polarization in the near future .",
    "in fact , with sufficient integration it may help distinguish between models that have very similar temperature power spectra in the @xmath128 range measured so far and so could add useful information .",
    "the wisconsin experiment is mostly sensitive to large scale polarization but because the signal in this part of the spectrum is very small it will be harder for it to detect polarization . on the other hand the measurement of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 will allow the experiment to put separate constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the prospect of detecting polarization is increasing quickly and in the near future we may have a positive detection .",
