    "in some kinds of variable stars , there is relations between the absolute magnitudes and the variation periods .",
    "this is called the period - luminosity ( pl ) relation .",
    "pl relations of long period variable stars ( for example , miras or semi - regular variable stars ( srvs ) ) have long been investigated since they were found in large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "when we use pl relation , we can estimate absolute magnitudes using periods . with these absolute magnitudes and apparent magnitudes from observations ,",
    "we can calculate distances of these stars .",
    "detailed study of pl relations has given the multiplicity of the relation usually explained by the difference in excited pulsation mode .",
    "for the red long - period variable stars , such a multiplicity is first reported by @xcite .",
    "although pl relations in our galaxy are studied , more studies will be required to establish the precise relation . in the case of lmc , we can study pl relations by using apparent magnitudes on assumption that all variable stars in lmc have the same distances , since the thickness of lmc is much smaller than the distance to lmc . on the other hand , it is obvious that variable stars in our galaxy have large relative difference in distances . to determine more precise pl relations in our galaxy , we need to obtain distances and apparent magnitudes for more variable stars",
    "so , we measured the distance from annual parallax using a vlbi method .    among long - period variable stars ,",
    "rx bootis ( rx boo ) is one of the most interesting star because the star has two different periods @xcite and classified as srb group which show low amplitude and less regular variability than miras or sra group .",
    "it is known that regular and high amplitude variables are found on a common pl relation for our galaxy and lmc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting whether or not the positions of rx boo situate on the pl sequence of miras .",
    "the study of the parallax of rx boo will be useful to clarify the nature of srb group .",
    "we performed astrometric observations with the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) .",
    "vera is a japanese vlbi array dedicated to phase referencing vlbi observations @xcite .",
    "it consists of four antennas ( mizusawa , iriki , ogasawara and ishigakijima ) .",
    "vera can measure annual parallaxes and proper motions of many astronomical objects at 22 and 43ghz . with the dual - beam system of vera , we observe target and reference sources simultaneously .",
    "the system makes it possible to cancel out the effect of atmospheric fluctuations between two sources @xcite .",
    "monitored rx  boo over twenty years with single - dish observations using effelsberg 100-m and medicina 32-m telescopes .",
    "they also observed water masers in rx  boo using the very large array ( vla ) on four occasions in the period from 1990 to 1992 and later in 1995 .",
    "then they revealed the distribution of water masers around rx  boo .",
    "they detected the emission of incomplete shell around rx  boo .",
    "the inner radius of the shell is estimated to be 15au .",
    "they conclude that the variability of water masers around rx  boo is due to the appearance and disappearance of maser clouds with a lifetime of @xmath41year . with infrared interferometers , the angular diameter of rx  boo",
    "is estimated as @xmath5 mas and @xmath6 mas in @xmath7 band ( 2.2 @xmath8 m ) and @xmath9 band ( @xmath10 m ) , respectively , with the model of uniform disks @xcite .",

    "such an estimate matches the comparatively small mass loss rate of this star .",
    "rx  boo seems to be before the phase of strong mass loss .",
