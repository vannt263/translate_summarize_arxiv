    "determination of the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition is one of the important nonperturbative problems in qcd to be addressed in lattice simulations .",
    "bielefeld group and cp - pacs collaborations using two different types of improved lattice action for fermions were able to estimate @xmath3 in the chiral limit and their values are in good agreement @xcite .",
    "still there are many sources of systematic uncertainties and new computations of @xmath3 with different actions are useful as an additional check .",
    "we made first large scale simulations of the nonperturbatively @xmath4 improved wilson fermion action .",
    "moreover we performed simulations with the lattice spacing @xmath5 substantially smaller than in studies by bielefeld and cp - pacs groups .",
    "the following fermionic action is employed in our study : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the original wilson action , @xmath8 is the clover coefficient determined nonperturbatively @xcite .",
    "we use wilson gauge field action .    the action ( [ fermact ] ) has been used in @xmath9 studies of lattice qcd by ukqcd and qcdsf collaborations @xcite .",
    "these studies confirmed that @xmath4 lattice artifacts are suppressed as expected . to fix the physical scale and @xmath10 ratio we used results obtained by these collaborations @xcite .",
    "so far only @xmath11 and @xmath12 finite temperature results obtained with action ( [ fermact ] ) are available @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained at a rather large quark mass ( @xmath13 ) . in this",
    "work me make simulations with @xmath14 what allows us to decrease @xmath10 down to @xmath15 .",
    "we choose the spatial extension of the lattice @xmath16 as a compromise between computational burden and need to reduce the finite size effects .",
    "it is known that the order parameter of the finite temperature phase transition in quenched qcd is the polyakov loop and the corresponding symmetry is global @xmath17 symmetry . in the chiral qcd",
    "the order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking transition is the chiral condensate @xmath18 .",
    "as numerical results show @xcite both order parameters can be used to locate the transition point at intermediate values of the quark mass .",
    "we use polyakov loop susceptibility to determine the transition temperature .",
    "hybrid monte carlo algorithm with parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , providing acceptance rates of about 70% is used in our simulations .",
    "the simulations were done on sr8000 hitachi at kek , tsukuba and mvs 1000 m at joint supercomputer center , moscow . for analysis sx5 nec at rcnp and pc - cluster at itp ,",
    "kanazawa were employed .",
    "our code performs at the speed of 2.4 gflops per node on hitachi computer .",
    "we needed from 1000 ( @xmath21 ) to 3000 ( @xmath22 ) trajectories for thermalization , depending on @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ". for runs started from configurations generated at the adjacent @xmath23 this value was much lower .",
    "we determined the transition temperature at two values of @xmath24 , 5.2 and 5.25 , varying @xmath23 as shown in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + [ table:1 ]    we fixed the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge on generated configurations .",
    "the simulated annealing algorithm has been used to fix the gauge .",
    "the advantages of this algorithm in comparison with the usual iterative algorithm has been demonstrated in @xmath25 pure gauge theory for ma gauge @xcite and maximal center gauge @xcite .",
    "abelian and monopole polyakov loops and their susceptibilities were measured on gauge fixed configurations .",
    "we found that for abelian and monopole observables the signal / noise ratio was better than that for gauge invariant nonabelian observables .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the results from quenched qcd at @xmath26 and both quenched and unquenched qcd at @xmath9 .",
    "in particular the maximum of the polyakov loop susceptibility is essentially better separated from the rest of the data for the monopole polyakov loop than for nonabelian polyakov loop .",
    "it is important that the transition temperature values determined by both susceptibilities are the same .",
    "s ( left ) , and the abelian , monopole and photon polyakov loops at @xmath27 ( right).,width=188,height=170 ]    s ( left ) , and the abelian , monopole and photon polyakov loops at @xmath27 ( right).,width=188,height=181 ]",
    "in fig.[ploop ] we show results for average of various kinds of polyakov loops .",
    "one can see that @xmath28 is a smooth function of @xmath23 and that abelian and monopole polyakov loops behavior is qualitatively the same as behavior of the nonabelian polyakov loop while the photon polyakov loop is almost constant across the transition .",
    "transition point @xmath23 , denoted as @xmath29 , has been determined from the maximum of the polyakov loop susceptibility , see fig [ susc1 ] . as can be seen from fig.[susc1 ] the susceptibilities for abelian and monopole polyakov loops have maxima at the same value of @xmath23 .",
    "we found that @xmath30 at @xmath27 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 , see fig.[susc1 ] .",
    "this was transformed into transition temperature with the help of the interpolation formula for @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the results are : @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in physical units , taking @xmath36 mev , we obtained @xmath37 and @xmath38mev , respectively . using again data from @xcite we estimate @xmath39 at the transition points .",

    "the ratio @xmath40 was computed for @xmath41 mev used in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that our results are in good qualitative agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "this agreement implies that the dependence of the transition temperature on the lattice spacing is rather weak .    for our lattice with @xmath42",
    "the question of the finite volume effects is very important . to check this effect we made simulations at @xmath43 on @xmath44 lattice .",
    "the @xmath23 value was chosen close to the transition point where finite volume effects should be more pronounced .",
    "we found that both average of the polyakov loop and its susceptibility are the same within error bars as in our main simulations on @xmath16 lattice .",
    "this implies that the finite volume effects should not spoil our conclusions .",
