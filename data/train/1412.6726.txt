    "undirected formation control has been one of the most studied subjects in multi - agent systems .",
    "the formation control model is described by two characteristics : one is an undirected graph describing the pattern of interaction , and the other is a set of scalar functions each of which describes the interaction law between a pair of adjacent agents .",
    "a detailed description is given below    let @xmath0 be an undirected connected graph of @xmath1 vertices @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the set of vertices adjacent to vertex @xmath4 .",
    "we then consider the motion of @xmath1 agents @xmath5 in @xmath6 by @xmath7 each @xmath8 with @xmath9 is a scalar function describing how adjacent agents @xmath10 and @xmath11 interact with each other .",
    "we require that @xmath8 be identical with @xmath12 for all @xmath9 , in other words , interactions among agents are reciprocal . in its most general form ,",
    "each @xmath8 could be a function of @xmath5 , and possibly the time variable @xmath13 as well . in this case , we have proved in @xcite that if @xmath14 is connected , then system , treated as a centralized control system , is approximately path - controllable over an open dense subset of the configuration space . yet ,",
    "if we regard system as a decentralized control system , i.e , each agent @xmath10 only accesses part of the information , then there is a restriction on what variables each @xmath8 can depend on .",
    "for example , it is often assumed that each agent @xmath10 knows agent @xmath11 if and only if @xmath11 is its neighbor , i.e , @xmath15 . then in this case",
    "each @xmath8 is at most a function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and possibly the time @xmath13 .    over the last decade ,",
    "there have been many solid works about using system to achieve decentralized formation control .",
    "questions about the level of interaction laws that are necessary for organizing such systems , questions about system convergence , questions about counting and locating stable equilibria , and questions about the issues of robustness and etc .",
    "have all been treated to some degree ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a popular decentralized algorithm , known as the krick s law @xcite , is that we assume each agent @xmath10 measures the mutual distance between himself and its neighbors @xmath11 .",
    "the control law is then given by @xmath16 for all @xmath9 where @xmath17 is the prescribed distance between @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the target formation . by following this decentralized algorithm , system",
    "will then be a gradient system with respect to the potential function @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that if each @xmath8 is a continuous function depending only on the distance @xmath19 , then the resulting system is always a gradient system @xcite .",
    "however , the associated potential function @xmath20 often has multiple local minima , and in some cases , the number of local minima has an exponential growth with respect to the number of agents ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "also , we note that if each @xmath8 depends only on the mutual distance @xmath19 as is the case if we adopt the krick s law for @xmath8 , then how a configuration is embedded into the euclidean space is not relevant , only the shape of the formation matters . in other words , if a configuration is an equilibrium associated with system , then any rotation or translation of the configuration will also be an equilibrium . in any of such case",
    ", the group of rigid motions is introduced to describe this phenomena .",
    "two configurations will be recognized as the same target formation if they are in the same orbit with respect to the group action .    in this paper , as in many earlier work on this problem , we will investigate system , treated as a decentralized formation control system , by equipping it with a set of new control laws .",
    "what distinguishes this paper from others is that in addition to the shape of the target configuration , we also emphasize its euclidean embedding . to be more precise ,",
    "we let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be two configurations with the same centroid , i.e , @xmath23 , and we distinguish @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the sense that these two configurations are recognized as the same target formation if and only if @xmath26 .",
    "we impose the condition that @xmath24 and @xmath25 have the same centroid because of the fact that the centroid of a configuration in an undirected formation control system is invariant along the evolution regardless of the choice of the control laws .",
    "the decentralized control law is then designed for each agent so that the solution of the control system may converge to the target configuration . in particular , we show that there is a quadratic lyapunov function associated with system whose unique local ( global ) minimum point is the target configuration .",
    "but we also note ( and we will see later in the paper ) that there may exist a continuum of equilibria for system , thus a solution of system may fail to converge to the global minimum point . to fix this problem , we then modify the formation control laws by adding noise terms .",
    "this is an application of simulated annealing to formation control systems .",
    "simulation results then show that sample paths of the modified stochastic system approach the global minimum point .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will first specify what information each agent knows , or in other words what variables @xmath8 can depend on .",
    "then we will introduce the decentralized formation control law , and establish the convergence of system . in section 3",
    ", we will explore one of the limitations of this formation control model by showing that there may exist a continuum of equilibria of system .",
    "for simplicity , we will only focus on trees as a special type of network topologies . in this special case ,",
    "we show that there is a simple condition for determining whether a configuration @xmath24 is an equilibrium or not , and thus there is a geometric characterization of the set of equilibria of system .",
    "the existence of continuum of equilibria poses a problem about the convergence of system to the target configuration . in section 4",
    ", we will focus on fixing this problem by applying the technique of simulated annealing to the algorithm .",
    "simulation results then show that a typical sample path will converge to the target configuration .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the decentralized formation control law and show that system , when equipped with this control law , converges to the set of equilibria .",
    "but before that , we need to be clear about what we mean by a decentralized formation control system .",
    "so in the first part of this section , we will specify what information each agent knows , i.e , what variables each @xmath8 can depend on .",
    "also we will specify how the information of the target configuration is distributed among agents .",
    "we first introduce the underlying space of system . as interactions among agents are reciprocal , the centroid of a configuration is always invariant along the evolution in an undirected formation control system , so we may as well assume that the centroid of a configuration is located at the origin .",
    "the configuration space @xmath27 , as the underlying space of system , is then defined by @xmath28 it is clear that @xmath27 is a euclidean space of dimension @xmath29 . in this paper",
    ", we assume that @xmath30 is the target configuration , i.e , each @xmath31 is the target position for agent @xmath10 .",
    "we will now specify what information each agent @xmath10 can access . in this paper ,",
    "if @xmath32 is an edge of @xmath14 , we then assume that    * agent @xmath10 knows @xmath33 ; * agent @xmath10 is able to measure @xmath34 at any time @xmath13 ;    consequently , if @xmath32 is an edge of @xmath14 , then we require that each scalar function @xmath8 depend only on @xmath34 , @xmath33 and possibly the time variable @xmath13 .",
    "suppose @xmath32 is an edge of @xmath14 , we then let the control law @xmath8 be defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the standard inner - product of two vectors , and @xmath37 is the standard euclidean norm of a vector .",
    "we note that in this definition , if we exchange roles of vertex @xmath4 and vertex @xmath38 , then @xmath12 will be identical with @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with our assumption that the formation control system is undirected .",
    "the main result of this section we will prove is about the convergence of system as stated below .",
    "let @xmath8 be the decentralized control law defined by expression .",
    "then there is a quadratic lyapunov function associated with system defined as @xmath39 let @xmath40 be a solution of system , then @xmath41 the derivative is zero if and only if @xmath42 is an equilibrium .    this proof is done by explicit computation .",
    "we check that @xmath43 it is then clear that the time derivative is zero if and only if each @xmath44 is zero which implies that @xmath24 is an equilibrium .    .",
    "there may exist multiple equilibria of system .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the next section that in the case @xmath14 is a tree graph there exists a continuum of equilibria . nevertheless , there is only one local ( and also global ) minimum point of the potential function @xmath20 which is @xmath45 .",
    "it thus suggests that we apply simulated annealing to this formation control law as we will discuss in the last section of the paper .",
    "+ _ remark ii_. notice that the potential function @xmath46 approaches infinity as @xmath47 goes to infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "we have @xmath48 so each solution @xmath42 of system has to remain in a bounded set , and thus converges to the set of equilibria . in other words",
    ", no agent escapes to infinity along the evolution .",
    "in this section , we will explore the set of equilibria of system .",
    "the main purpose of doing this is to illustrate one of the limitations of this formation control law .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath20 is a lyapunov function for a dynamical system @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a unique equilibrium , then @xmath50 is stable and all solutions of the system will converge to @xmath50 .",
    "however , this is not the case here , i.e , the target configuration @xmath45 will not be the unique equilibrium of system . as we will see in this section there may exist a continuum of equilibria of system . for simplicity",
    ", we will only focus on the case where the interaction pattern @xmath14 is a tree graph .",
    "we focus on this special class of interaction patterns because in this case there is a simple condition telling us whether a configuration @xmath24 is an equilibrium or not .",
    "in particular , we will use this condition to characterize the set of equilibria of system in a geometric way .",
    "a path in a graph @xmath14 is a finite sequence of edges which connects a sequence of vertices .",
    "a simple path then refers to a path which does not have repeated vertices , and a circle refers to a path without repeated vertices or edges , other than the repetition of the starting and ending vertices .",
    "an undirected graph @xmath14 is a * tree * if any two vertices of @xmath14 are connected by a unique simple path , i.e , there is no circle in @xmath14 .",
    "each tree graph can be inductively built up starting with one vertex , and then at each step , we join a new vertex via one new edge to an existing vertex .",
    "this , in particular , implies that each tree graph has a leaf , i.e , a vertex of degree one .",
    "an example of a tree graph is given in figure [ tree ] .",
    "vertices and @xmath51 edges .",
    "vertices are labeled with respect to an inductive construction .",
    "for any two vertices in the graph , there is a unique path connecting them .",
    "the four vertices @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath51 and @xmath54 are leaves of the tree graph above . ]      in this part , we show that if the graph @xmath14 is a tree graph , then the set of equilibria associated with system can be characterized by a simple condition stated below .",
    "[ equic ] let @xmath55 be a tree graph , then @xmath24 is an equilibrium associated with system if and only if @xmath56 for all @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that if each @xmath8 is zero , then @xmath24 is an equilibrium .",
    "we now prove the other direction , and the proof is done by induction on the number of agents .",
    "+ _ base case_. suppose @xmath57 , then @xmath58 .",
    "so if @xmath59 is an equilibrium , then either @xmath60 or @xmath61 , but they both imply @xmath62 .",
    "+ _ inductive step_. assume the lemma holds for @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and we prove for the case @xmath65 .",
    "since each tree graph has at least one leaf , we may assume that vertex @xmath66 is a leaf of @xmath14 and it joins the graph via edge @xmath67 .",
    "suppose @xmath68 is an equilibrium , then we must have @xmath69 then by the same arguments we used for proving @xmath70 in the base case , we conclude that @xmath71 .",
    "now let @xmath72 and let @xmath73 be the subgraph induced by @xmath74 , i.e , for any two vertices @xmath4 and @xmath38 in @xmath74 , the pair @xmath32 is an edge of @xmath75 if and only if it is an edge of @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath75 is also a tree graph .",
    "let @xmath25 be a sub - configuration of @xmath24 consisting of agents @xmath76 , then @xmath25 is also an equilibrium under @xmath8 with @xmath77 .",
    "this holds because @xmath24 is an equilibrium and meanwhile @xmath78 , so the agent @xmath79 does nt attract or repel any agent in @xmath25 . by induction",
    ", we have @xmath80 for all @xmath77 .",
    "this then , combined with the condition @xmath81 , establishes the proof .      in this part",
    ", we will use the equilibrium condition to characterize the set of equilibria of system .",
    "[ conte ] let @xmath14 be a tree graph .",

    "then there is a diffeomorphism of @xmath82 given by @xmath83 as a product of @xmath84 copies of the unit sphere @xmath85 in @xmath86 .",
    "the proof of the theorem will again carried out by induction on the number of agents .",
    "so we first prove for the case @xmath57 , and the inductive step will be given after that .",
    "+ _ base case_. we show that theorem [ conte ] holds in the case @xmath57 .",
    "suppose @xmath59 is an equilibrium , then by lemma [ equic ] , we have @xmath62 , this then implies @xmath87 the set of equilibria associated with system is characterized by equation , together with the condition that @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 be a subset of @xmath6 defined by @xmath90 then it is clear that @xmath82 is diffeomorphic to @xmath89 . to see this",
    ", we define a map @xmath91 by @xmath92 it is clear that the map @xmath93 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "we will now show that the set @xmath89 is itself a sphere in @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath94 and let @xmath95 be the sphere of radius @xmath96 centered at @xmath97 in @xmath86 , i.e , @xmath98 it is clear by computation that @xmath99 in fact , if @xmath100 lies inside @xmath101 , then @xmath102 and if @xmath103 lies outside @xmath101 , then @xmath104 this then completes the proof of the base case .",
    "+ _ inductive step_. we will now use induction to prove theorem [ conte ] .",
    "we assume that the theorem holds for @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and we prove for the case @xmath65 .",
    "we again assume that vertex @xmath66 is a leaf of @xmath14 and it joins the graph via edge @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath73 be the subgraph of @xmath14 induced by vertices @xmath106 , then @xmath75 is a tree graph .",
    "let @xmath25 be a sub - configuration of @xmath24 consisting of agents @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath107 be a subset of @xmath108 defined by @xmath109 the equilibria set @xmath82 is then characterized by the condition that @xmath25 is an equilibrium , together with the condition that @xmath81 .",
    "since these two conditions are independent of each other , there is a diffeomorphism of @xmath82 given by @xmath110 we may translate each @xmath111 in @xmath6 so that the centroid of @xmath25 is zero after translation . since @xmath75 is a tree graph , by induction the set @xmath107 is diffeomorphic to @xmath112 , and hence @xmath82 is diffeomorphic to @xmath113 .",
    "one may ponder at this point whether the existence of continuum of equilibria is a consequence of the fact that a tree graph is not a rigid graph .",
    "however , it is not the case . for example , if we consider three agents evolving on a plane with @xmath14 being the complete graph , one can then show that the set of equilibria is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of two circles .",
    "though at this moment we do not have a statement about the set of equilibria in the most general case , the tree - graph cases , as well as the three - agents example suggest that it may be inevitable for system to possess a continuum of equilibria .",
    "in the previous section , we have showed that there may exist a continuum of equilibria of system under the proposed formation control law .",
    "this certainly affects the efficacy of the algorithm because there may exist a solution of system which converges to an equilibrium other than the target configuration . in this section",
    ", we will focus on fixing the problem . in view of the fact that there is only one local ( global ) minimum of the quadratic lyapunov function @xmath20 which is the target configuration , we attempt to apply simulated annealing , as a heuristic method , to the decentralized formation control algorithm .",
    "in particular , if we add an appropriate noise term to each @xmath8 , the resulting stochastic system is then described by @xmath114 where the @xmath115 are independent standard wiener processes , and @xmath116 is a scalar function of time @xmath13 and @xmath117 defined by @xmath118 with @xmath119 and @xmath120 positive constants .",
    "as @xmath121 decays along time , the impact of the noise tends to zero as @xmath13 goes to infinity . with these noise terms",
    ", we expect that the centroid of the stochastic formation control system is still invariant along the evolution because otherwise the entire configuration may drift to some place which is neither predictable nor controllable .",
    "fortunately this is the case here as stated in the next theorem .",
    "the centroid of the configuration is invariant along the evolution of the stochastic formation control system described by expression .",
    "let @xmath122 be a function defined by @xmath123 let @xmath124 be the @xmath66-th coordinate of agent @xmath10 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath125 for all @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath127 be a vector collecting the @xmath66-th coordinates of all the agents , i.e , @xmath128 by defining vector @xmath129 , we can rewrite the system equation in a matrix form as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a symmetric matrix of zero - column / row - sum with the @xmath132-th , @xmath133 , entry defined by @xmath134 and each @xmath135 is also a symmetric matrix of zero - column / row - sum defined by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the standard basis of @xmath138 .",
    "we now apply the it rule , and get the stochastic differential equation for @xmath139 as follows @xmath140 notice that for any @xmath141 , we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a vector of all ones , and @xmath144 so then all inner - products in equation vanish .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we now give some examples of this stochastic formation control system , and illustrate how sample paths of this stochastic system evolve over time @xmath13 .",
