    "giant shells in nearby galaxies often contain young clusters on their periphery , suggesting that gravitational instabilities in swept - up gas lead to co - moving , self - gravitating clouds that collapse into stars ( mccray & kafatos 1987 ; tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) , or that pre - existing clouds are compressed to an unstable state as the shell passes , producing the same result ( woodward 1976 ; klein et al .",

    "star formation that is sequentially triggered like this should be able to continue for an extended time as one generation leads to another in any remaining gas .",
    "whether it continues indefinitely and fills a whole galaxy depends on the triggering efficiency ( mueller & arnett 1976 ; gerola & seiden 1978 ) .",
    "if the mass of the second generation is larger than the mass of the first , then the activity should grow until it dominates all star formation",
    ". this may be the case in the solar neighborhood , where most star formation occurs in dense clusters ( lada , strom , & myers 1993 ; carpenter 2000 ) that are located at the edges of high pressure regions , indicative of triggering ( e.g. , the trifid nebula : lefloch & cernicharo 2000 ; rosette : phelps & lada 1997 ; orion : reipurth , rodriguez & chini 1999 ; ophiuchus : de geus 1992 ; sco cen : preibisch & zinnecker 1999 ; cepheus ob3 and perseus ob2 : sargent 1979 ; w3/4/5 : carpenter , heyer , & snell 2000 ; see review in elmegreen et al .",

    "the models use the thin shell approximation proposed by sedov ( 1959 ) , in which a thin , 3-dimensional shell surrounding a hot medium is divided into a number of elements and a system of equations for motion , mass and energy is solved .",
    "the approximation is appropriate for a blastwave propagating in the interstellar medium because the radius of the shell is much larger than its thickness during the majority of the evolution .",
    "the main advantage of this method over solutions of the complete hydrodynamical and poisson equations in 3 dimensions is a much lower demand of cpu time .",
    "this gives us the possibility to explore an extended grid of independent parameters .",
    "however , the adoption of this method restricts the spatial resolution , which is limited by the finite thickness of the compressed layer .",
    "the interstellar medium is modeled by a stratified , non - magnetic disk with a gaussian density profile of dispersion @xmath12 , midplane density @xmath7 , velocity dispersion @xmath13 , local rotation curve @xmath14 , and local angular rate , @xmath15 .",
    "three dimensional expanding shells were driven into this medium by an energy injection rate @xmath16 for energy @xmath17 and time @xmath18 , after which the shells coasted on residual internal pressure .",
    "values of @xmath19 ergs and @xmath20 yr correspond to a medium - size ob association .",
    "the expected resistance to expansion by external magnetic compressive forces can be modeled approximately by increasing @xmath13 to a value larger than the turbulent speed , perhaps by a factor of 2 .",
    "the force from magnetic tension can not be modeled this way ; it tends to elongate a bubble or contain it within the disk ( tomisaka 1990 , 1998 ; ferrier et al .",
    "the implications of these and other magnetic forces on bubble instability are not known and will require more elaborate modeling .",
    "the effects of density and velocity irregularities in the swept - up gas and surrounding medium are not considered ( see silich et al .",
    "gravitational instabilities develop faster in the denser parts of this medium , so the time scale for instabilities and triggering in a clumpy gas can be shorter than the time scale given here for a uniform gas .",
    "we expect that the clump triggering time can still be estimated from our results using the derived density dependence for shell collapse at the higher density of the clump .",
    "the thin shell approximation breaks down for small dense clumps , however , because they erode by surface instabilities and get compressed in 3-dimensions when the blastwave passes ( maclow et al .",

    "galactic rotation introduces a coriolis force that attempts to turn around the expansion of a bubble and limit its total radius .",

    "the tidal limiting density for a spherical cluster or cloud that co - rotates with the galaxy is @xmath37 . * the dimensionless scale height for total midplane density @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath39 this expression uses @xmath40 which is valid for an isothermal self - gravitating layer with @xmath41 our simulations use a gaussian layer with @xmath42 , so the relation between @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath12 is not exactly the same .",
    "the difference between a gaussian layer and a @xmath45 layer is small for @xmath46 , so we use the isothermal disk expressions in this paper . +",

    "are free parameters and some combinations give @xmath48 larger than 1 . *",
    "a dimensionless parameter that involves the internal rms speed and the shell luminosity is @xmath49 and the same type of parameter with the external rms speed is @xmath50 the first of these luminosity parameters was studied by whitworth & francis ( 2002 ) , who found @xmath51 as a condition for shell collapse .",
    "the second parameter was studied , in a slightly different form , by palou & ehlerov ( 2002 ) , and ehlerov & palou ( 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the ratio of the two rms speeds , @xmath52 , is also considered here .",
    "the total number of parameter combinations from table 1 is around 20,000 , but most of these give unrealistic values for the dimensionless parameters .",

    "the times for the beginning of the instability , given by equation [ eq : time1 ] , and the beginning of significant fragmentation , given by equation [ eq : time ] , are plotted in figure 1 versus the midplane dynamical time , @xmath56 .",
    "the range of parameters used for this plot differs from the range in table 1 because here we include many different densities .",
    "thus we consider @xmath57 1 , 2 , and 4 instead of the density explicitly , and we take @xmath58 to 22 km s@xmath59 in steps of 2 km s@xmath60 and @xmath61 1 , and 3 km s@xmath59 .",

    "the numbers of models used to determine these fractions are shown in figure 3 to illustrate the breadth of coverage of the parameter space and the likely uncertainty in the triggering fractions .",
    "the top left panel in figure 2 has a lower triggering fraction than the other panels because the normalization for each value of the abscissa in the top left is the constant total number of runs , which is large . in the other panels ,",
    "the normalization is the number of runs in each bin of the dimensionless parameter .",
    "we have to use the total in the top left because if there is no triggering , then @xmath28 and the abscissa are not defined .",
    "figure 2 indicates that gravitational collapse in shearing , expanding shells is enhanced for large values of @xmath67 , small values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , large values of @xmath68 , and small values of @xmath69 . in the first case ,",
    "the instability is unlikely for small relative gas densities because the shell punches through the thin gas layer before it goes unstable .",
    "the instability is also unlikely for large @xmath0 and @xmath1 because the corresponding large coriolis force and shear slow the expansion , causing the shell to twist around and limit its accumulation of mass .",
    "collapse is more likely for large @xmath68 because the ambient medium is close to instability anyway .",
    "collapse is more likely for small @xmath69 because then the shell is thin and dense for a given radius , so the pressure in the swept - up gas can not easily resist its self - gravity . with @xmath70 for significant triggering ,",
    "the fragmentation time becomes @xmath71 , which is less than half the dynamical time in the external medium .",
    "the density dependence in @xmath28 from equation ( [ eq : tf ] ) helps to explain the @xmath0 dependence in figure 2 . if the ambient density is converted into a mass column density @xmath32 using the velocity dispersion to get the scale height , @xmath72 , then @xmath73^{0.2}\\right)^{0.5}c_{ext}/\\left(\\pi g\\sigma\\right)$ ] .",

    "if @xmath3 is small because of shell cooling , then the shell can collapse even if @xmath0 is large enough to make the disk otherwise stable .",
    "the total unstable mass in the shell at the fragmentation time @xmath28 varies by only a small amount , a factor of @xmath77 , for all of the unstable models .",
    "the average of this total mass scales mostly with the bubble luminosity , but does not correlate with any of the dimensionless parameters , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "figure 5 plots a histogram of the number of shell models in regularly spaced logarithmic intervals of the total unstable mass .",
    "the shells need a sufficiently large mass to be unstable for typical expansion speeds . the total mass involved is @xmath78 m@xmath9 , although the molecular part that forms stars will be smaller .    the shell radius at the fragmentation time , @xmath79 ,",
    "is shown relative to the scale height , @xmath12 , in figure 6 .",
    "this radius is defined to be the distance from the expansion center , measured along the plane , of the most unstable part of the shell at the time of fragmentation .",
    "the ratio @xmath80 depends mostly on the internal sound speed , aside from the usual dependence on @xmath81 that comes into the theoretical expression for the bubble expansion ( weaver et al .",
    "there is a slight correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath1 , but not with @xmath0 , because shear stretches a bubble and gives it a larger average radius at the fragmentation time .",
    "the results suggest that the shell radius along the plane is @xmath10 to 3 scale heights when star formation begins .",
    "this distance corresponds to @xmath82 to 300 pc for typical disks , in agreement with observations .",
    "the shell size should be @xmath10 times larger in dwarf galaxies because of their larger scale heights ( e.g. , walter & brinks 1999 ) .",
    "a shell is larger than this perpendicular to the plane because of its more rapid expansion into lower densities .",
    "sequential star formation triggered by the collapse of expanding shells requires essentially three conditions : that the midplane density of the gas be comparable to the stellar midplane density , that the toomre parameter , @xmath0 , be relatively low , and that the velocity dispersion in the swept - up gas be relatively low compared to @xmath83 .",
    "the first of these conditions avoids blow out above and below the plane in the time it takes the shell to go unstable .",
    "the second avoids shell stalling by coriolis forces , and the third makes the shell dense and strongly self - gravitating ( whitworth & francis 2002 ) .",
    "other dimensionless parameters have a similar sensitivity : @xmath1 and the inverse of @xmath68 behave like @xmath0 .    when and where are the dimensionless conditions for triggering fulfilled ?",
    "in early type spiral galaxies where the relative gas density is low , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath84 can be large ( caldwell et al . 1992 ) and @xmath67 can be small . in this case ,",
    "shell instabilities require very small values of @xmath85 ; i.e. , either very large shell - driving luminosities or very low rms dispersions and temperatures in the swept - up gas .",
    "this is rather exceptional , although perhaps the triggering conditions are fulfilled in the vicinity of ob 78 in m31 . in late type spirals and gas rich dwarf galaxies , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath84 are small and",
    "@xmath48 is large .",
    "consequently , triggered star formation in expanding shells should be more frequent , as in the supergiant shells of the lmc ( yamaguchi et al .",
    "2001a , b ) and ic 2574 ( stewart & walter 2000 ) .",
    "the relative gas density is often high in starburst regions too , but there the absolute gas density is high as well , so the interstellar dynamical time can be very short . if it is shorter than the lifetime of an o - type star , which is typical for nuclear starburst regions , then bubble expansions will not be significantly aided by supernova explosions before the collapse time .",
    "this lowers @xmath4 for a given ob association mass .",
    "starburst regions can also have large @xmath13 , which limits shell growth and makes hii regions ineffective at moving gas around . as a result ,",
    "spontaneous star formation processes , or those triggered by random supernovae , are more likely .",
    "perhaps the best place for shell - triggered star formation was in the early universe , when most galaxies were gas - rich and the dynamical time for an average galactocentric radius was much longer than an o - star lifetime .",
    "galaxies at high redshift should contain many gaseous shells and triggering events , causing them to resemble sheared and massive versions of today s irregular dwarf galaxies .",
