    "recent experimental progress in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)-based quantum processors allowed the demonstration of quantum algorithms @xcite , including grover s algorithm @xcite and quantum fourier transform @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been possible to implement the simplest instance of shor s algorithm , namely the factorization of 15 , using 7 qubits and a sequence of about 300 spin - selective radio - frequency pulses @xcite . in parallel , thanks to the development of techniques for the manipulation of cold atoms in linear traps , the realization of up to 50 two - qubit control - not gates within the relevant decoherence time scale is currently becoming possible@xcite .",
    "solid state realizations are also under way in several experimental groups working with various solid state devices . in particular , it has been demonstrated that a superconducting tunnel junction circuit can behave as an artificial spin 1/2 atom , whose evolution can be controlled by applying microwave pulses .",
    "the quality factor of quantum coherence is sufficiently high to envisage the realization of two - qubit gates based on capacitively coupled circuits of this type @xcite .    in this context",
    ", it is of primary importance to find efficient quantum algorithms , that could be usefully simulated with a small number of qubits .",
    "such algorithms would naturally become the ideal software for demonstrative experiments in the coming generation of quantum processors .",
    "dynamical models represent a natural testing ground for quantum information processors .",
    "the algorithm for the quantum baker s map @xcite has been recently implemented on a three qubit nmr quantum processor @xcite .",
    "these experiments tested the sensitivity to perturbations , in a system which is characterized by chaotic unpredictable dynamics in the classical limit .    in this paper",
    "we show that quantum computers can simulate efficiently the quantum localization of classical chaos .",
    "dynamical localization is one of the most interesting phenomena that characterize the quantum behavior of classically chaotic systems : quantum interference effects suppress chaotic diffusion in momentum , leading to exponentially localized wave functions .",
    "this phenomenon was first found and studied in the quantum kicked rotator model @xcite and has profound analogies with anderson localization of electronic transport in disordered materials @xcite .",
    "dynamical localization has been observed experimentally in the microwave ionization of rydberg atoms @xcite and is now actively studied in experiments with cold atoms @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study dynamical localization for the quantum sawtooth map , using the algorithm developed in ref . @xcite .",
    "this algorithm has some specific advantages with respect to similar algorithms for the simulation of other dynamical systems , for instance the kicked rotator @xcite .",
    "there are no extra work space qubits , namely all the qubits are used to simulate the dynamics of the system .",
    "this implies that less than 40 qubits would be sufficient to make simulations inaccessible to present day supercomputers .",
    "we note that this figure has to be compared with the more than 1000 qubits required to the shor s algorithm to outperform classical computations .",
    "we will also show that in this model dynamical localization could be observed already with 6 qubits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the sawtooth map model , focusing on the regime of dynamical localization . in section iii",
    "we show that a quantum computer operating with few qubits can indeed perform simulations of dynamical localization . in section",
    "iv we discuss how to extract information ( the localization length ) from the quantum computer wave function . in section v we study the stability of those computations in the presence of static imperfections in the quantum computer hardware . in section",
    "vi we discuss the transition to quantum chaos , induced by static imperfections , in the quasienergy spectral statistics .",
    "in section vii we present our conclusions .",
    "the quantum sawtooth map is the quantized version of the classical sawtooth map , which is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 are conjugated action - angle variables ( @xmath6 ) , and the over bars denote the variables after one map iteration . introducing the rescaled momentum variable @xmath7 , one can see that the classical dynamics depends only on the single parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the map ( [ clmap ] ) can be studied on the cylinder ( @xmath9 ) , which can also be closed to form a torus of length @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an integer . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the motion is completely chaotic and exhibits normal diffusion : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the discrete time measured in units of map iterations and the average @xmath15 is performed over an ensemble of particles with initial momentum @xmath16 and random phases @xmath17 . for @xmath18 the diffusion coefficient",
    "is well approximated by the random phase approximation , @xmath19 .",
    "the quantum evolution in one map iteration is described by a unitary operator @xmath20 ( called floquet operator ) acting on the wave function @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( we set @xmath25 ) .",
    "the classical limit corresponds to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . in refs .",
    "@xcite we studied the map ( [ qumap ] ) in the semiclassical regime .",
    "this is possible by increasing the number of qubits @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the total number of levels ) , with @xmath31 , @xmath32 . in this way",
    ", the number of levels inside the `` unit cell '' @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) grows exponentially with the number of qubits ( @xmath35 ) , and the effective planck constant @xmath36 when @xmath37 .",
    "differently from previous studies , in this paper we study the map ( [ qumap ] ) in the deep quantum regime of dynamical localization . for this purpose ,",
    "we keep @xmath38 constant .",
    "thus the effective planck constant is fixed and the number of cells @xmath11 grows exponentially with the number of qubits ( @xmath39 ) . in this case , one studies the quantum sawtooth map on the cylinder ( @xmath40 ) , which is cut - off to a finite number of cells due to the finite quantum ( or classical ) computer memory .",
    "we stress again that , since in a quantum computer the memory capabilities grow exponentially with the number of qubits , already with less than 40 qubits one could make simulations of systems inaccessible for today s supercomputers .",
    "similar to other models of quantum chaos @xcite , the quantum interference in the sawtooth map leads to suppression of classical chaotic diffusion after a break time @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the classical diffusion coefficient , measured in number of levels ( @xmath43 ) . for @xmath44 only @xmath45 levels",
    "are populated and the localization length @xmath46 for the average probability distribution is approximately equal @xcite : @xmath47 thus the quantum localization can be detected if @xmath1 is smaller than the system size @xmath30 .    in the following we consider @xmath48 , two values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , so that the above analytical estimate gives @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that at @xmath55 the system is in a momentum eigenstate , @xmath56 .",
    "since this is a quantum register state , it can be obtained in @xmath57 one - qubit operations starting from the fiducial state ( `` ground state '' ) @xmath58 of the quantum computer hardware .",
    "an exponentially efficient quantum algorithm for the simulation of the map ( [ qumap ] ) was described in refs .",
    "it is based on the forward / backward quantum fourier transform @xcite between momentum and coordinate bases : on the whole , it requires @xmath59 gates per map iteration ( @xmath60 controlled - phase shifts and @xmath61 hadamard gates ) .",
    "this number has to be compared with the @xmath62 operations required to a classical computer to simulate one map iteration by means of the fast fourier transform .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show that , using our quantum algorithm , exponential localization can be clearly seen already with @xmath63 qubits . after the break time @xmath64",
    ", the probability distribution over the momentum eigenbasis decays exponentially , @xmath65 with @xmath66 the initial momentum value . here",
    "the localization length is @xmath67 , and classical diffusion is suppressed after a break time @xmath68 , in agreement with the estimates ( [ loc1])-([loc2 ] ) .",
    "this requires a number @xmath69 of one- or two - qubit quantum gates .",
    "the full curve of fig .",
    "1 shows that an exponentially localized distribution indeed appears at @xmath70 .",
    "such a distribution is frozen in time , apart from quantum fluctuations , which we partially smooth out by averaging over a few map steps .",
    "the localization can be seen by the comparison of the probability distributions taken immediately after @xmath64 ( full curve in fig . 1 ) and at a much larger time @xmath71 ( dashed curve in the same figure ) .",
    "we also note that the asymptotic tails of the wave functions decay as a power law(see fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath72 this happens due to the discontinuity in the kicking force of eq .",
    "( [ clmap ] ) , @xmath73 , when the angle variable @xmath74 .",
    "for that reason the matrix elements of the one period evolution operator @xmath20 for the quantum map ( [ qumap ] ) decay as a power law in the momentum eigenbasis : @xmath75 , with @xmath76 . this case",
    "was investigated for random matrices , where it was shown that eigenfunctions are also algebraically localized with the same exponent @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we also note that dynamical localization in discontinuous systems was studied in @xcite .",
    "since the localization picture is not very sensitive to the behavior of the tails of the wave function , a rough estimate of the crossover between the exponential decay ( [ expdecay ] ) and the power law decay ( [ power ] ) is given by their crossing point , @xmath78 this implies that by increasing @xmath1 the exponential localization is pushed to larger momentum windows and down to smaller probabilities .",
    "we now discuss how it would be possible to extract information ( the value of the localization length ) from a quantum computer simulating the above described dynamics .",
    "the localization length can be measured by running the algorithm several times up to a time @xmath79 .",
    "each run is followed by a standard projective measurement on the computational ( momentum ) basis .",
    "the outcomes of the measurements can be stored in histogram bins of width @xmath80 , and then the localization length can be extracted from a fit of the exponential decay of this coarse - grained distribution over the momentum basis . in this way",
    "the localization length can be obtained with accuracy @xmath2 after the order of @xmath3 computer runs .",
    "it is important to note that it is sufficient to perform a coarse grained measurement to generate a coarse grained distribution .",
    "this means that it will be sufficient to measure the most significant qubits , and ignore those that would give a measurement accuracy below the coarse graining @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the number of runs and measurements is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is necessary to make about @xmath82 map iterations to obtain the localized distribution ( see eqs .",
    "( [ loc1],[loc2 ] ) ) .",
    "this is true both for the present quantum algorithm and for classical computation .",
    "this implies that a classical computer needs @xmath83 operations to extract the localization length , while a quantum computer would require @xmath84 elementary gates ( classically one can use a basis size @xmath85 to detect localization ) . in this sense , for @xmath86 the quantum computer gives a square root speed up if both classical and quantum computers perform @xmath87 map iterations .",
    "however , for a fixed number of iterations @xmath14 the quantum computation gives an exponential gain .",
    "for @xmath88 such a gain can be very important for more complex physical models , in order to check if the system is truly localized @xcite .",
    "in order to study the effects of static imperfections on the stability of the above described algorithm , we model the quantum computer hardware as a linear array of qubits with static imperfections , represented by fluctuations in the individual qubit energies and residual short - range inter - qubit couplings @xcite .",
    "the model is described by the following many - body hamiltonian : @xmath89 where the @xmath90i s are the pauli matrices for the qubit @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the average level spacing for one qubit .",
    "the second sum in ( [ imperf ] ) runs over nearest - neighbor qubit pairs , zero boundary conditions are applied , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 are randomly and uniformly distributed in the intervals @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we model the implementation of the above algorithm on this hardware architecture as a sequence of instantaneous and perfect one- and two - qubit gates , separated by a time interval @xmath97 .",
    "therefore we study numerically the evolution in time of the quantum computer wave function in the presence of the following many - body hamiltonian : @xmath98 where @xmath99 here @xmath100 realizes the @xmath49-th elementary gate according to the sequence prescribed by the algorithm .",
    "we assume that the phase accumulation given by @xmath92 is eliminated by standard spin echo techniques @xcite . in this case , the remaining terms in the static hamiltonian ( [ imperf ] ) can be seen as residual terms after imperfect spin echoes and give unwanted phase rotations and qubit couplings .",
    "the effect of static imperfections on the probability distribution over the momentum basis is shown in fig .",
    "2 , for @xmath51 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and different rescaled imperfection strengths @xmath104 . for @xmath105",
    ", the localization peak is reproduced with high fidelity , while the tails of the wave function are strongly enhanced .",
    "this is due to the fact that errors affecting the most significant qubits can induce a direct transfer of probability very far in the momentum basis @xcite . for @xmath106 a measurement of the decay of the localization peak would overestimate the localization length by a factor two , while for @xmath107 any trace of dynamical localization has been destroyed .",
    "= 8.cm    in order to study in a more quantitative way the stability of quantum computation in the presence of static imperfections , we consider the following two quantities : ( i ) the diffusion coefficient @xmath108 , obtained from the relation @xmath109 this is an important characteristic related to transport properties of the system ; ( ii ) the inverse participation ratio @xmath110 this quantity determines the number of basis states significantly populated by the wave function and gives an estimate of the localization length of the system . we stress that , differently from the previous quantity , @xmath111 is local in the localized regime , i.e. it is insensitive to the behavior of exponentially small tails .",
    "= 8.cm    in fig .",
    "3 we show @xmath112 as a function of time , for @xmath101 qubits , @xmath103 , and different imperfection strengths @xmath113 . by means of these curves",
    "we extract the diffusion coefficients @xmath108 from linear fits extended to the first few map steps . in the same figure , we show that similar curves are obtained for @xmath114 .",
    "the dependence of the inverse participation ratio on @xmath14 is shown in fig .",
    "4 , again for @xmath51 , @xmath101 .",
    "we note that , for imperfection strengths strong enough to induce huge variations in the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath115 ) , @xmath111 is only slightly modified ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "iterating the map ( [ qumap ] ) long enough ( @xmath117 ) , we get the saturation value @xmath118 .",
    "this quantity increases with @xmath113 and one has complete delocalization when @xmath119 ( this is evident for @xmath120 in fig .",
    "4 ; in this case @xmath111 saturates after @xmath121 map iterations ) .",
    "again we note that similar curves are obtained for @xmath114 ( see fig .",
    "= 8.cm    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the dependence of diffusion coefficient @xmath42 on @xmath113 for different @xmath122 values . from each curve",
    "we extract the critical imperfection strength @xmath123 corresponding to doubling of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath124 .",
    "the data of fig . 7 show that @xmath125 drops exponentially with @xmath122 .",
    "this result is similar to the one found in @xcite for noisy gate errors and can be explained by means of the following argument .",
    "static imperfections can couple states very far in momentum space via a single spin flip . as a consequence ,",
    "they create @xmath122 peaks @xcite with probability @xmath126 in each peak . here",
    "@xmath127 is the effective perturbation strength , with @xmath128 time between hadamard gates acting on a given qubit .",
    "these gates transfer the accumulated phase error @xmath129 into amplitude errors . integrating the contribution of each peak",
    ", one gets @xmath130 with @xmath131 one can estimate the critical value @xmath125 to double the exact ( @xmath132 ) diffusion coefficient from @xmath133 , giving @xmath134 in good agreement with the data of fig .",
    "= 8.cm    in fig .",
    "6 we show the dependence of the inverse participation ratio @xmath135 on @xmath113 for different number of qubits @xmath122 . from each curve",
    "we extract two critical imperfection strengths : ( i ) @xmath136 , to get an inverse participation ratio equal to a given fraction of the full hilbert space , for example @xmath137 .",
    "this threshold is significant of the transition to ergodic completely delocalized wave functions .",
    "( ii ) @xmath138 , to double the exact inverse participation ratio .",
    "we stress that this quantity gives a rough estimate of the imperfection threshold for reliable quantum computation of localization in the absence of error correction .",
    "the dependence of @xmath136 and @xmath138 on @xmath122 are shown in fig .",
    "these quantities drop polynomially with @xmath122 , in sharp contrast with the exponential drop of @xmath125 .",
    "this algebraic threshold can be understood as follows .",
    "the eigenstates of the unperturbed ( @xmath132 , j=0 ) floquet operator @xmath20 in ( [ qumap ] ) can be written as @xmath139 where @xmath140 are the quantum register ( momentum ) states . in the localized regime",
    ", @xmath141 s are randomly fluctuating inside the localization domain of size @xmath1 , and exponentially small outside it .",
    "wave function normalization imposes @xmath142 . due to exponential localization , static imperfections couple significantly the unperturbed eigenfunctions only when their localization domains overlap .",
    "we estimate in this case the transition matrix elements according to perturbation theory . for @xmath103",
    ", they have a typical value @xmath143 in this expression , the typical phase error is @xmath144 ( sum of @xmath122 random detunings @xmath93 s ) , with @xmath145 random sign , and @xmath146 is the time used by the quantum computer to simulate one map step .",
    "the last estimate in ( [ vtyp ] ) results from the sum of order @xmath1 terms of amplitude @xmath147 and random phases . since",
    "the spacing between significantly coupled quasi - energy eigenstates is @xmath148 , the threshold for the breaking of perturbation theory can be estimated as @xmath149 the analytical result @xmath150 is confirmed by the numerical data of fig .",
    "7 . for the case",
    "@xmath114 , the threshold @xmath136 is reduced ( see fig .",
    "4 ) since residual inter - qubit interactions introduce further couplings between floquet eigenstates .",
    "however , an estimate similar to ( [ vtyp ] ) , which does not modify the functional dependence ( [ chaosth ] ) , can be derived .",
    "we stress the striking difference between this polynomial scaling and the exponential scaling for the mixing of unperturbed eigenstates obtained in the ergodic regime ( in which @xmath151 ) and in the more general quasi - integrable regime @xcite .",
    "we also note that the different sensitivity of local and non local quantities was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "however , the authors of ref . @xcite considered the effect of noisy gates , while we consider internal static imperfections .",
    "in this section , we show that spectral statistics is an ideally suited tool to detect the destruction of localization by static imperfections .",
    "we study the spectral statistics of the floquet operator for a quantum computer running the quantum sawtooth map algorithm in the presence of static imperfections , @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the hamiltonian ( [ himp ] ) and @xmath154 the number of gates per map iteration .",
    "we construct numerically the floquet operator in the computational ( momentum ) basis , using the fact that a single map iteration of each quantum register state gives a column in the matrix representation of this operator .",
    "then we diagonalize the floquet matrix and get the so - called quasienergy eigenvalues @xmath155 and eigenvectors @xmath156 , @xmath157    a convenient way to characterize the spectral properties of the system is to study the level spacing statistics @xmath158 , where @xmath159 gives the probability to find two adjacent levels ( quasienergies ) whose energy difference , normalized to the average level spacing , belongs to the interval @xmath160 $ ] ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the localized regime , floquet eigenvectors with very close",
    "eigenvalues may lay so far apart that their overlap is negligible . as a consequence ,",
    "eigenvalues are uncorrelated , that is their spectral statistic is given by the poisson distribution , @xmath161 on the contrary , in the delocalized regime wave functions are ergodic , and their overlap gives a significant coupling matrix element between states nearby in energy . in this case the spectral statistics @xmath158 follows the wigner - dyson distribution , @xmath162 typical of random matrices in the absence of time reversal symmetry @xcite ( static imperfections break this symmetry ) . in fig .",
    "8 we show that static imperfections indeed induce a crossover from the localized regime with the poisson statistics to quantum chaos characterized by wigner - dyson statistics .",
    "we have also studied this crossover as a function of the number of qubits ( data not shown ) : the threshold @xmath163 for the emergence of quantum chaos is consistent with the scaling @xmath164 , in agreement with the threshold ( [ ergest ] ) obtained for the mixing of unperturbed eigenfunctions .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a quantum computer operating with a small number of qubits can simulate efficiently quantum localization effects .",
    "the evaluation of the localization length @xmath1 with accuracy @xmath2 requires a number of computer runs of order @xmath3 , followed by a projective measurement in the computational ( momentum ) basis .",
    "we stress that , in the presence of static imperfections , a reliable computation of the localization length is possible even without quantum error correction , up to an imperfection strength threshold which drops only algebraically with the number of qubits .",
    "we also stress that localization is a purely quantum phenomenon , which is quite fragile in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "therefore we believe that the simulation of the physics of localization can be an interesting testing ground for the coming generation of quantum processors operating in the presence of decoherence and static imperfections .",

    "<S> we show that a quantum computer operating with a small number of qubits can simulate the dynamical localization of classical chaos in a system described by the quantum sawtooth map model . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the system is computed efficiently up to a time @xmath0 , and then the localization length @xmath1 can be obtained with accuracy @xmath2 by means of order @xmath3 computer runs , followed by coarse grained projective measurements on the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that in the presence of static imperfections a reliable computation of the localization length is possible without error correction up to an imperfection threshold which drops polynomially with the number of qubits .    2 </S>"
