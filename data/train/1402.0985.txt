    "starting with the work of ott , grebogi and yorke  @xcite , a variety of different techniques for controlling unstable or chaotic states in complex systems has been developed within the last decade . among other control methods ,",
    "time - delayed feedback scheme  @xcite ( also referred to as pyragas control or time - delay autosynchronization ) proves oneself to be an efficient tool , allowing a noninvasive stabilization of unstable periodic orbits of dynamical systems  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in the meantime , time - delayed feedback control has been successfully applied to a broad variety of spatially extended systems , including , e.g. , plasma physics  @xcite , nonlinear optics  @xcite , electrochemical  @xcite and neural systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , control of the dynamics of spatiotemporal patterns in reaction - diffusion systems have been of increasing interest in recent years .",
    "we mention only delay - induced turbulent structures in a diffusive hutchinson equation  @xcite , delay - modulated oscillatory hexagon superlattices and stripes in a brusselator model  @xcite , control of spatiotemporal patterns in a gray - scott model  @xcite , spatiotemporal patterns in a prey - predator plankton system  @xcite , dynamics of turing patterns in the lengyel - epstein system under time - delayed feedback  @xcite or moving localized and periodic structures in the fitzhugh - nagumo model  @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the influence of the delayed feedback on the stability properties of a single stationary localized structure in a three component reaction - diffusion system was studied in details  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the presence of the feedback force can induce complex dynamical behavior of the localized solution , leading among other things to the formation of moving or breathing structures .",
    "however , an opposite problem of stabilization of a certain unstable localized state is still not understood to a large extent .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the influence of the time delayed control on the dynamics of breathing localized structures in a three - component reaction - diffusion system with one activator and two inhibitors .",
    "we shall show that a variation of the delay time and the feedback strength can indeed lead to stabilization of the breathing .",
    "in addition , more complex delay - induced periodic or quasiperiodic oscillations of the localized structure can also be found . in order to understand the impact of the delayed feedback term on the dynamics of the breathing localized structure , we derive an order parameter equation in the vicinity of the bifurcation point where oscillatory dynamics sets in . the desired equation is a subject to a nonlinear delay - differential equation , explicitly describing the temporal evolution of the localized structure .",
    "as mentioned above , here we are interested in the dynamics of breathing localized structures in a three - component reaction - diffusion system with one activator and two inhibitors : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the activating component , whereas @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the inhibiting components , @xmath4 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 in the polynomial nonlinear function @xmath6 is positive as well as diffusion coefficients @xmath7 of the corresponding components and dimensionless constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 , representing the ratios of the characteristic time scales of both inhibitors @xmath10 and @xmath11 with respect to that of the activator . the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 are also positive , whereas @xmath14 violates the inversion symmetry and has arbitrary sign .",
    "finally , @xmath15 denotes the delay time , whereas the parameter @xmath16 is the delay strength .",
    "note that the time delayed feedback term is introduced in such a way that the corresponding coupling matrix is an unit one  @xcite . in the absence of the delayed feedback",
    "the system  ( [ eq:3krd ] ) was first introduced in  @xcite as an extension of the phenomenological model for a planar dc gas - discharge system with high - ohmic semiconductor electrode . on the other hand , the system  ( [ eq:3krd ] )",
    "can be considered in a more general contexts , like as a three - component extension of the fitzhugh - nagumo system for nerve pulse transmission  @xcite or a model system of a pattern forming chemical reaction in a microemulsion  @xcite . however , in the present study we have no specific application in mind and provide a general analysis of the system in question which can be later addressed to a specific applications mentioned above .",
    "notice that from a practical perspective , the usage of identity control scheme may be quite restrictive .",
    "notwithstanding , a close analytic treatment of the simplest case of the control scheme enables to gain a deeper insight into underlying stabilization mechanisms and to get some ideas about the impact of the time delayed feedback on the dynamical properties of the localized structure .",
    "from now on we consider the general form of the reaction - diffusion system  ( [ eq:3krd ] ) @xmath17+\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{e}\\,\\bigl(\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{r},t)-\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{r},t-\\tau)\\bigr)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a vector - function , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a nonlinear reaction - diffusion operator and @xmath21 denotes an identity coupling matrix .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of a two - dimensional stationary single localized solution @xmath22 of the system  ( [ eq : geneqdel ] ) , which exists and which is stable in appropriate range of parameters  @xcite . in the absence of the delay term ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath23 , this stationary localized structure can lose its stability with the change of one or more control parameters , e.g. , @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "typical destabilization scenarios include drift - bifurcation , leading to a motion of localized structures  @xcite , the hopf - bifurcation ( also called andronov - hopf bifurcation ) , where so - called breathing localized structures are formed  @xcite or a nontrivial combination of both instabilities in the vicinity of a codimensional - two bifurcation point  @xcite",
    ".    for @xmath23 , linear stability of the stationary solution @xmath22 can be analyzed by means of the ansatz @xmath24 , leading to the linear eigenvalue problem @xmath25 where the linear operator @xmath26 stands for a linearization of the operator @xmath27 around the stationary solution @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the set of eigenvalues and @xmath30 are the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "notice that generally the operator @xmath26 is not self - adjoint , so its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are typically complex .",
    "the destabilization scenario we are interested in here is that a pair of complex - conjugated eigenvalues passes through the imaginary axis as a control parameter exceeds some critical value . in what follows ,",
    "we use the time constant @xmath9 as a control parameter .",
    "if @xmath9 is below a critical value @xmath31 , both inhibitors almost instantaneously adapt to the current distribution of the activator and the stationary solution remains stable .",
    "therefore a mechanism for imposing instabilities is delayed inhibition , where one or several inhibitors are too slow to adapt to activator changes  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath32 , an addition of a symmetric perturbation in form of the unstable breathing mode to the localized structure leads to slightly increased concentration in the center , that is , both concentrations become narrower than their counterparts in the stationary solution .",
    "therefore they spread to the sides due to diffusion . while the inhibitor is slow , it strongly increases its concentration to overcompensate the losses caused by diffusion , whereas the activator decreases only slightly .",
    "that is , after some time one gets excess amount of the inhibitor , distributed over the whole localized structure .",
    "it causes a decay of the whole solution , especially on the tails of the activator .",
    "hence both peaks become narrower . on the other hand ,",
    "the losses due to diffusion cause the decay of the inhibitor in the center . as a consequence ,",
    "the activator can again slightly increase its concentration , and new breathing cycles begins .",

    "the stationary localized solution @xmath28 exists for all values of the delay strength @xmath16 and is not affected by the delay term .",
    "however , its stability may change  @xcite .",
