    "the sdss - i ( data release 5 ) provided a substantially more homogeneous sample of 6 new am cvn stars , allowing for a local space density measurement , limited by the still small size of the sample @xcite .",
    "noting that the am  cvn stars occupy a relatively sparsely populated region in color space where the spectroscopic completeness down to @xmath9 in the sdss database is only @xmath620% , we started an extensive spectroscopic survey program at a number of observatories world - wide to resolve the ` hidden ' population of am  cvn stars in the sdss photometry .",
    "the aim of this project is to significantly increase the total known population of am  cvn stars and , more importantly , enlarge the homogeneous sample of these sources . ultimately , the space density of am cvn stars , and further population characteristics such as their orbital period distribution , will allow comparisons with predictions from theoretical models , and will allow better modeling of the galactic gravitational - wave foreground signal seen by _ lisa_.    details of our spectroscopic follow - up program , in particular the sample selection criteria , and the first ( peculiar ) new am cvn star ( sdss  j080449.49 + 161624.8 ) were described in @xcite .",
