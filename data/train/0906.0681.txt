    "physics is an observational and experimental science ; it is about the ingenious interrogation of nature and the interpretation of its answers via a mathematical language .",
    "although this may seem an obvious statement , it is nonetheless an increasingly harder point to maintain as theoretical physics proceeds toward more abstract and contrived issues .",
    "however , without the guidance of experiments and observations , all our theories are doomed to remain mathematical constructs without connection to reality .",
    "the most striking such case is the decades old quest for a quantum theory of gravitation .",
    "quantum gravity ( qg ) has posed a challenge to many theoretical physicists of the last generation and it remains far from understood .",
    "although we do not yet have a single experiment or observation forcing us to introduce such a theory , we definitely need it , not only on philosophical grounds ( reductionism as a driving force in physics ) , but also because we know that in physically relevant regimes ( e.g.  singularities in cosmology and in black holes ... ) our classical theory of gravitation , i.e.  general relativity ( gr ) , fails to be predictive",
    ". however , when searching for qg , we have to confront not only deep theoretical problems ( e.g.  the renormalizability of gravitational theories , the possible loss of unitarity in gravitational phenomena @xcite , the meaning of time in qg @xcite ) but also the lack of observational and experimental guidance .",
    "the typical scale at which qg effects should become relevant is expected to be the one at which the gravitational action ( the einstein - hilbert action for gr ) becomes of the order of the quantum of action @xmath0 .",
    "this happens at the so called planck scale @xmath1 which corresponds to energies well above the capabilities of any earth based experiment as well as any observationally accessible regime .",
    "however , it was realized ( mainly over the course of the past decade ) that the situation may not be as bleak as it appears .",
    "in fact , models of gravitation beyond gr and models of qg have shown that there can be several of what we term low energy `` relic signatures '' of these models , which would lead to deviation from the standard theory predictions ( standard model of particle interactions ( sm ) plus gr ) in specific regimes .",
    "some of these new phenomena , which comprise what is often termed `` qg phenomenology '' , include :    * quantum decoherence and state collapse @xcite * qg imprint on initial cosmological perturbations @xcite * cosmological variation of couplings @xcite * tev black holes , related to extra - dimensions @xcite * violation of discrete symmetries @xcite * violation of space - time symmetries @xcite    in this review we focus upon the phenomenology of violations of fundamental symmetries , given that a convenient way to perform high - precision tests is to look for experimental deviations from symmetries that are believed to hold _ exactly _ in nature and that could be broken by qg .",
    "an example of such a fundamental symmetry is cpt invariance , which requires that physics be unchanged under the combination of charge conjugation ( c ) , parity inversion ( p ) and time reversal ( t ) .",
    "c connects particles and antiparticles , p represents a spatial reflection of physical quantities with respect to the coordinate origin and t reverses a physics reaction in time .    in quantum field theory , lorentz symmetry",
    "is intimately related to cpt symmetry . indeed , one of the hypotheses of the well known `` cpt theorem ''",
    "is lorentz invariance .",
    "if cpt is broken , then at least one of the hypotheses of the cpt theorem should also break down .",
    "it has been proven @xcite that lorentz symmetry is the failing assumption in the so called `` anti - cpt theorem '' , which states that in any unitary , local , relativistic point - particle field theory cpt breaking implies lorentz violation .",
    "note however that the converse of this statement is not true : it is possible to violate lorentz invariance while keeping cpt exact .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study both the theory and the phenomenology of lorentz invariance violation ( lv ) , which may yield a glimpse of qg .",
    "although from the theoretical point of view the exploration of this possibility has been active for many years @xcite , a phenomenology of lv has developed only within the last ten years or so . before the mid-1990s , few works investigated the experimental consequences of lv ( see however @xcite ) , because new effects were expected only in particle interactions at energies of order the planck mass @xmath2 .",
    "later , it was realised that there are special situations in which new effects could manifest also at lower energy .",
    "these situations were termed `` windows on quantum gravity '' .",
    "in recent years , attempts to place constraints on high - energy deviations from li have mainly focused on modified dispersion relations for elementary particles .",
    "indeed , specific hints of lv arose from various approaches to quantum gravity . among the many examples",
    "are string theory tensor vevs @xcite , space - time foam  @xcite , semiclassical spin - network calculations in loop qg  @xcite , non - commutative geometry  @xcite , some brane - world backgrounds  @xcite and condensed matter analogues of `` emergent gravity ''  @xcite .    in most of the",
    "above mentioned qg models , lv enters through modified dispersion relations .",
    "these relations can be cast in the general form @xmath3where he low energy speed of light @xmath4 ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the particle energy and momentum , respectively ; @xmath7 is a particle - physics mass - scale ( possibly associated with a symmetry breaking / emergence scale ) and @xmath8 denotes the relevant qg scale .",
    "generally , it is assumed that @xmath8 is of order the planck mass : @xmath9gev , corresponding to a quantum ( or emergent ) gravity effect .",
    "the function @xmath10 can be expanded in powers of the momentum ( energy and momentum are basically indistinguishable at high energies , although they are both taken to be smaller than the planck scale ) , and the lowest order lv terms ( @xmath6 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) have primarily been considered @xcite .    at first glance",
    ", it appears hopeless to search for effects suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "even the most energetic particles ever detected ( ultra high energy cosmic rays , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) have @xmath13 .",
    "however , even tiny corrections can be magnified into a significant effect when dealing with high energies ( but still well below the planck scale ) , long distances of signal propagation , or peculiar reactions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a partial list of these _ windows on qg _ includes :    * sidereal variation of lv couplings as the lab moves with respect to a preferred frame or direction * cumulative effects : long baseline dispersion and vacuum birefringence ( e.g.  of signals from gamma ray bursts , active galactic nuclei , pulsars ) * anomalous ( normally forbidden ) threshold reactions allowed by lv terms ( e.g.  photon decay , vacuum erenkov effect ) * shifting of existing threshold reactions ( e.g.  photon annihilation from blazars , gzk reaction ) * lv induced decays not characterised by a threshold ( e.g.  decay of a particle from one helicity to the other or photon splitting ) * maximum velocity ( e.g.  synchrotron peak from supernova remnants ) * dynamical effects of lv background fields ( e.g. gravitational coupling and additional wave modes )    however not all of these tests are similarly robust against the underlying physical framework that one chooses to justify the use of the modified dispersion relations of the form ( [ eq : disprel ] ) .",
    "although the above cited cumulative effects exclusively use the form of the modified dispersion relations , all the others depend on the underlying dynamics of interacting particles and on whether or not the standard energy - momentum conservation holds . thus , to cast most of the constraints on dispersion relations of the form ( [ eq : disprel ] ) , one needs to adopt a specific theoretical framework justifying the use of such deformed dispersion relations .",
    "although many kinematic frameworks have been proposed to account for lv , dynamically meaningful realisations of lv are more interesting from a phenomenological point of view , as they provide a more complete framework in which to compute reactions . an obvious requirement for any such model is that it agree with known experimental observations .",
    "thus , a convenient way to study lv is to embed it into an effective framework that contains the sm by construction .",
    "effective field theory ( eft ) is a well established means of describing physics .",
    "it is particularly suitable for our purposes because it provides a sufficiently robust and general set of rules to describe lv physics without requiring that we know the details of the qg models leading to such effects . indeed , many qg models can be reduced to eft with lv ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is widely believed that the sm itself , although it can describe particle interactions up to at least @xmath14 at unprecedented precision , could be such an effective model . in eft ,",
    "the presence of non - renormalizable operators in the lagrangian is a signal of the presence of new higher energy interactions .",
    "one can infer the energy scale at which these operators are generated ( and at which the theory breaks down ) by simply looking at their dimensionfull coupling constants and their associated mass scale .",
    "( a typical example is @xmath15fermion interaction , with the coupling constant @xmath16 . ) on the contrary , for the sm this type of reasoning can not be applied because its renormalizability does not allow one even to guess at which scale new physics should appear .",
    "when constructing an eft of planck - scale lv , one can deal with this restriction in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", one can introduce lv terms in the sm lagrangian by adding only operators that preserve renormalizability . on the other hand",
    ", one can explicitly break lorentz invariance by introducing non - renormalizable operators of mass dimension larger than four .",
    "the most crucial difference between the two approaches is that the renormalizable operators lead to contributions that are relevant even at low energy ( and hence generically need very suppressed couplings to fit experimental data ) , but the non - renormalizable operators are relevant only at high - energy and , moreover , are naturally planck - scale suppressed .",
    "both possibilities have been explored in the so called standard model extension ( sme ) , which we discuss in the following section .",
    "most of the research in eft performed with only renormalizable ( _ i.e. _  mass dimension 3 and 4 ) lv operators has been carried out within the so called ( minimal ) sme  @xcite .",
    "it consists of the sm plus all lv renormalizable operators ( _ i.e. _  of mass dimension @xmath17 ) that can be written without changing the field content or violating gauge symmetry .",
    "the operators appearing in the sme can be conveniently classified according to their behaviour under cpt @xcite .    because the most common particles used to cast constraints on lv are photons and electrons , a prominent role is played by lv qed . the high energy ( @xmath18 ) dispersion relations for qed can be expressed as ( see @xcite and references therein for more details ) @xmath19 where the first equation is for electrons and the second one is for photons .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend in general on the helicity state of the particles and are related to the coupling parameters of the lv operators in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the positron dispersion relation is the same as ( [ eq : smerotinvdisp ] ) with the replacement @xmath23 , which only changes the @xmath24 term .",
    "note that the typical energy , @xmath25 , at which a new phenomenology should begin to appear is quite low . if , for example @xmath26 , the corresponding extra term is comparable to the electron mass @xmath27 precisely at @xmath28 .",
    "even worse , for the linear modification to the dispersion relation , in the case where @xmath29 , we find that @xmath30 .",
    "( note that , by chance , this energy is close to the present upper limit on the photon mass , @xmath31 @xcite . )",
    "however , the natural values for the parameters @xmath32 may be much lower than @xmath33 . for example , they can be suppressed by ratios of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "if we take @xmath36 , then the suppression factor is @xmath37 , which is not too far from the limits that have been placed on dimension 4 lv parameters to date .    because a rich literature is available on constraints on the minimal sme @xcite , we focus on non - renormalizable extensions in the following section .",
    "the lowest order non - renormalizable lv operators for sme have mass dimension 5 .",
    "myers & pospelov @xcite found that there are essentially only three operators of dimension 5 , quadratic in the fields , that can be added to the qed lagrangian and that preserve rotation and gauge invariance , but break local li .",
    "these operators , which result in a contribution of @xmath38 to the dispersion relation of the particles , are : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the dual of @xmath41 and where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "all these terms also violate cpt symmetry .",
    "recently , this construction was extended to the whole sm @xcite .    from ( [ eq : lvterms ] ) the dispersion relations of the fields can be modified as follows . for the photon , we find @xmath44 where the @xmath45 and @xmath46 signs denote right and left circular polarisation , respectively . for the fermion , we find @xmath47 where @xmath48and where the @xmath45 and @xmath46 signs denote positive and negative helicity states , respectively . for the antifermion , simple ",
    "hole interpretation \" arguments show that the same dispersion relation holds , yielding @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote anti - fermion and fermion coefficients , respectively  @xcite .",
    "observations involving very high energies can thus potentially cast an @xmath33 constraint on the coefficients defined above .",
    "a natural question arises : what is the theoretically expected value of the lv coefficients in the modified dispersion relations shown above ?",
    "this question is clearly intimately related to the meaning of any constraint procedure .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that , for an unknown reason , the dimensionless coefficients @xmath52 , which according to the well - known dirac criterion should be of order @xmath33 , are defined up to a dimensionless factor of @xmath53 .",
    "then , any constraint of order @xmath54 would be ineffective , assuming that our aim is to learn something about the underlying qg theory .    this problem could be further exacerbated by renormalization group effects , which in principle could strongly suppress the low - energy values of the lv coefficients even if they are @xmath33 at high energies .",
    "however , the renormalization group equations for the lv parameters for dimension 5 lv qed have been derived in @xcite and they show that the running is logarithmic",
    ". therefore , low energy constraints are robust against renormalization group effects .    in conclusion ,",
    "because we lack a definite qg model to rely on , we assume our lv parameters to be @xmath33 at the planck scale and we judge the strength of our constraints against this reference value .",
    "there is however a problem with the theory described above .",
    "it is indeed generic that even starting with an eft with only lv of mass dimension 5 and 6 for free particles , radiative corrections due to particle interactions will generate lower - dimension lv terms that will then become dominant  @xcite , as their dimensionless coefficients are of the same order as the higher dimension ones ( @xmath33 , given our previous assumption , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , radiative corrections do not preserve a dispersion relation of the form shown in ( [ eq : disp_rel_phot],[eq : disp_rel_ferm ] ) , but they automatically induce extra unsuppressed lv terms in @xmath6 and @xmath11 , which dominate the @xmath12 . either a symmetry ( or some other mechanism ) protects the lower dimension operators from large lv , or the suppression of the non - renormalizable operators indeed will always be greater than that of the renormalizable ones .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is provided by supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , a symmetry relating fermions to bosons , i.e.  matter with interaction carriers .",
    "susy is intimately related to lorentz invariance .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that the composition of at least two susy transformations induces space - time translations .",
    "however , susy can still be an exact symmetry even in the presence of lv and it can serve as a custodial symmetry , preventing certain operators from appearing in lv field theories .",
    "the effect of susy on lv is to prevent dimension @xmath55 , renormalizable lv operators to be present in the lagrangian .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated @xcite that the renormalization group equations for supersymmetric qed plus the addition of dimension 5 lv operators  la myers & pospelov do not generate lower dimensional operators , if susy is unbroken . however , this is not the case for our low energy world , of which susy is definitely not a symmetry .",
    "the effect of soft susy breaking was again investigated in @xcite .",
    "as expected , it was found that , when susy is broken , the renormalizable operators appear in the lagrangian .",
    "in particular , dimension @xmath56 operators arise from the percolation of dimension @xmath57 lv operators , for which these relationships have been demonstrated . ] .",
    "the effect of susy soft - breaking is , however , to introduce a suppression of order @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) or @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 is the scale of soft susy breaking .",
    "given the present constraints , the theory in which @xmath59 must be fine - tuned to be viable , because the susy - breaking - induced suppression is not powerful enough to eliminate linear modifications in the dispersion relation of electrons . however , if @xmath63 , the induced dimension 4 terms are sufficiently suppressed , provided that @xmath64 .    in summary ,",
    "mass dimension 5 lv operators seem to be unnatural , even considering the effects of susy , because the corresponding lv parameters have to be much less than their `` natural '' value @xmath33 to fit current low energy data .",
    "however , dimension 6 lv does not suffer from this problem .",
    "there is no clear argument accounting for why the dimension 5 operators should not appear in the high energy theory .",
    "; therefore the leading order contributions have to be suppressed by 2 powers of @xmath2 and hence must have dimension 6 .",
    "however , the liouville inspired string theory model @xcite is an example in which the leading order lv terms have mass dimension 5 ( as the string action is proportional to @xmath65 ) @xcite .",
    "] however , it can be shown that if we assume cpt invariance for the planck scale theory , then dimension 5 , cpt odd lv operators are forbidden , and only dimension 6 operators can appear .",
    "therefore , cpt and ( soft broken ) susy produce a viable lv theory .",
    "this is encouraging enough to allow us to consider this theory a serious candidate for lv , but currently no conclusive statements can be made .",
    "for the reasons given above , it is interesting to study theories with higher dimension contributions .",
    "the candidate theory should preserve cpt and should be supersymmetric . in the absence of a dynamical model , we can proceed effectively by adding to the sm ( actually , for simplicity , to the qed ) all possible dimension 6 , cpt even operators @xcite .",
    "the complete dimension 6 sme is not known .",
    "we still lack the lv induced interaction terms and the cpt odd kinetic ones .",
    "this is not a severe limitation , however .",
    "indeed , lv induced interactions are expected to have a very suppressed rate ; thus , we do not expect them to be observable in elementary particle experiments . on the other hand",
    ", we have already shown that the major attraction of dimension 6 sme is essentially related to the assumption that cpt is an exact symmetry ; therefore , we neglect cpt odd terms .    the cpt even dimension 6 lv terms",
    "have only recently been computed @xcite through the same procedure used by myers & pospelov for dimension 5 lv .",
    "the known nonrenormalizable cpt even fermion operators are @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the usual left and right spin projectors @xmath68 and where @xmath69 is the usual qed covariant derivative .",
    "all coefficients @xmath70 are dimensionless because we factorize suitable powers of the planck mass .",
    "the known photon operator is @xmath71 from these operators , the dispersion relations of electrons and photons can be computed , yielding @xmath72 where @xmath27 is the electron mass and where @xmath73 .",
    "also , notice that a term proportional to @xmath74 is generated .",
    "however , this term is suppressed by the tiny ratio @xmath75 and can be safely neglected , provided that @xmath76 .",
    "because the high - energy fermion states are almost exactly chiral , we can further simplify the fermion dispersion relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp - rel - dim6 ] ) ( we pose @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) @xmath79 because it is suppressed by @xmath80 , we will drop in the following the quadratic contribution @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "therefore , any limit larger than @xmath82 placed on this term does not have to be considered as an effective constraint .",
    "to date , the best constraint for electron lv parameters of dimension 4 in sme is @xmath83 @xcite . ] .",
    "it may seem puzzling that in a cpt invariant theory we distinguish between different fermion helicities .",
    "however , although they are cpt invariant , some of the lv terms displayed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : op - dim6-phot ] ) are odd under p and t. however , cpt invariance allows us to determine a relationship between the lv coefficients of the electrons and those of the positrons . indeed , to obtain it",
    "we must consider that , by cpt , the dispersion relation of the positron is given by ( [ eq : disp - rel - dim6 ] ) , with the replacements @xmath84 and @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that the relevant positron coefficients @xmath85 are such that @xmath86 , where @xmath87 indicates a positron of positive / negative helicity ( and similarly for the @xmath88 ) .",
    "altough eft is a natural choice of framework in which to study lv , there are other possibilities , arising in some models of string theory , that deserve attention .",
    "indeed , if in the high energy theory a hidden sector exists that can not be accessed because it lives , for example , on a different @xmath89brane from us , there are lv effects that can not be fit in an eft description . because the eft approach is nothing more than a highly reasonable , but rather arbitrary `` assumption '' , it is worth studying and constraining additional models , given that they may evade the majority of the constraints discussed in this review .",
    "we consider here the model presented in @xcite , in which modified dispersion relations are found based on the liouville string approach to quantum space - time @xcite .",
    "liouville - string models of space - time foam @xcite motivate corrections to the usual relativistic dispersion relations that are first order in the particle energies and that correspond to a vacuum refractive index @xmath90 , where @xmath91 . models with quadratic dependences of the vacuum refractive index on energy : @xmath92 have also been considered @xcite .    in particular , the d - particle realization of the liouville.string approach predicts that only gauge bosons such as photons , not charged matter particles such as electrons , might have qg - modified dispersion relations .",
    "this difference may be traced to the facts that @xcite excitations which are charged under the gauge group are represented by open strings with their ends attached to the d - brane @xcite , and that only neutral excitations are allowed to propagate in the bulk space transverse to the brane .",
    "thus , if we consider photons and electrons , in this model the parameter @xmath52 is forced to be null , whereas @xmath42 is free to vary .",
    "even more importantly , the theory is cpt even , implying that vacuum is not birefringent for photons ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "lorentz invariance of physical laws relies on only few assumptions : the principle of relativity , stating the equivalence of physical laws for non - accelerated observers , isotropy ( no preferred direction ) and homogeneity ( no preferred location ) of space - time , and a notion of precausality , requiring that the time ordering of co - local events in one reference frame be preserved @xcite .",
    "all the realizations of lv we have discussed so far explicitly violate the principle of relativity by introducing a preferred reference frame .",
    "this may seem a high price to pay to include qg effects in low energy physics .",
    "for this reason , it is worth exploring an alternative possibility that keeps the relativity principle but that relaxes one or more of the above postulates .",
    "such a possibility can lead to the so - called very special relativity framework @xcite , which was discovered to correspond to the break down of isotropy and to be described by a finslerian - type geometry  @xcite . in this example , however , the generators of the new relativity group number fewer than the usual ten associated with poincar invariance .",
    "specifically , there is an explicit breaking of the @xmath94 group associated with rotational invariance .",
    "one may wonder whether there exist alternative relativity groups with the same number of generators as special relativity .",
    "currently , we know of no such generalization in coordinate space",
    ". however , it has been suggested that , at least in momentum space , such a generalization is possible , and it was termed  doubly \" or  deformed \" ( to stress the fact that it still has 10 generators ) special relativity , dsr . even though dsr aims at consistently including the dynamics , a complete formulation capable of doing so is still missing , and present attempts face major problems .",
    "thus , at present dsr is only a kinematic theory .",
    "nevertheless , it is attractive because it does not postulate the existence of a preferred frame , but rather deforms the usual concept of lorentz invariance in the following sense .    consider the lorentz algebra of the generators of rotations , @xmath95 , and boosts , @xmath96:@xmath97 = \\imath\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}\\ ; l_k\\ ; ; \\qquad[l_i , b_j ] = \\imath\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}\\ ; b_k\\ ; ; \\qquad[b_i , b_j ] = -\\imath\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}\\ ; l_k\\label{lb}\\]](latin indices @xmath98 run from 1 to 3 ) and supplement it with the following commutators between the lorentz generators and those of translations in spacetime ( the momentum operators @xmath99 and @xmath100):@xmath101=0\\ ; ; \\qquad[l_i , p_j ] = \\imath\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}\\ ; p_k\\;;\\label{lp}\\]]@xmath102 = \\imath\\ ; f_1\\left(\\frac{p}{\\kappa}\\right ) p_i\\;;\\label{bp0}\\]]@xmath103 = \\imath\\left [ \\delta_{ij } \\ ; f_2\\left(\\frac{p}{\\kappa}\\right ) p_0 + f_3\\left(\\frac{p}{\\kappa}\\right )   \\frac{p_i \\ ; p_j}{\\kappa } \\right]\\;.\\label{bpj}\\]]where @xmath56 is some unknown energy scale .",
    "finally , assume @xmath104 = 0 $ ] .",
    "the commutation relations ( [ bp0])([bpj ] ) are given in terms of three unspecified , dimensionless structure functions @xmath105",
    ", @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , and they are sufficiently general to include all known dsr proposals  the dsr1  @xcite , dsr2  @xcite , and dsr3  @xcite . furthermore",
    ", in all the dsrs considered to date , the dimensionless arguments of these functions are specialized to@xmath108so rotational symmetry is completely unaffected . for the @xmath109 limit to reduce to ordinary special relativity , @xmath105 and @xmath106 must tend to @xmath110 , and @xmath107 must tend to some finite value .",
    "dsr theory postulates that the lorentz group still generates space - time symmetries but that it acts in a non - linear way on the fields , such that not only is the speed of light @xmath111 an invariant quantity , but also that there is a new invariant momentum scale @xmath56 which is usually taken to be of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "note that dsr - like features are found in models of non - commutative geometry , in particular in the @xmath56-minkowski framework @xcite , as well as in non - canonically non commutative field theories @xcite .",
    "concerning phenomenology , an important point about dsr in momentum space is that in all three of its formulations ( dsr1  @xcite , dsr2  @xcite , and dsr3  @xcite ) the component of the four momentum having deformed commutation with the boost generator can always be rewritten as a non - linear combination of some energy - momentum vector that transforms linearly under the lorentz group @xcite .",
    "for example in the case of dsr2  @xcite one can write s@xmath112it is easy to ensure that while @xmath113 satisfies the usual dispersion relation @xmath114 ( for a particle with mass @xmath27 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath115 satisfy the modified relation@xmath116furthermore , a different composition for energy - momentum now holds , given that the composition for the physical dsr momentum @xmath6 must be derived from the standard energy - momentum conservation of the pseudo - variable @xmath113 and in general implies non - linear terms .    despite its appealing , dsr is riddled with many open problems .",
    "first , if dsr is formulated as described above  that is , only in momentum space  then it is an incomplete theory .",
    "moreover , because it is always possible to introduce the new variables @xmath117 , on which the lorentz group acts in a linear manner , the only way that dsr can avoid triviality is if there is some physical way of distinguishing the pseudo - energy @xmath118 from the true - energy @xmath5 , and the pseudo - momentum @xmath119 from the true - momentum @xmath120 .",
    "if not , dsr is no more than a nonlinear choice of coordinates in momentum space . in view of the standard relations @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( which are presumably modified in dsr ) , it is clear that to physically distinguish the pseudo - energy @xmath123 from the true - energy @xmath5 , and the pseudo - momentum @xmath119 from the true - momentum @xmath120 , one must know how to relate momenta to position . at a minimum , one needs to develop a notion of dsr spacetime . in this endeavor ,",
    "there have been two distinct lines of approach , one presuming commutative spacetime coordinates , the other attempting to relate the dsr feature in momentum space to a non commutative position space . in both cases ,",
    "several authors have pointed out major problems . in the case of commutative",
    "spacetime coordinates , some analyses have led authors to question the triviality  @xcite or internal consistency  @xcite of dsr . on the other hand , non - commutative proposals @xcite are not yet well understood , although intense research in this direction is under way@xcite .",
    "dsr is still a subject of active research and debate @xcite ; nonetheless , it has not yet attained the level of maturity needed to cast robust constraints . for these reasons , in the next section we focus upon eft and discuss the constraints within this framework .",
    "there is now a well - established literature on the experimental and observational constraints on renormalizable operators .",
    "given that such operators involve effects that are not _ a priori _ planck suppressed , experimental tests indeed constrain the coefficients of dimension 3 and 4 lv operators to be very small @xcite .",
    "caveat the above discussion on the natural values of such coefficients , we focus here on the lowest order non - renormalizable operators .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of the most common types of constraints .    for definiteness",

    "therefore , it is worthwhile to consider alternative scenarios , such as those presented in section  [ sec : others ] . given that some of these alternative frameworks currently do not allow full control of the dynamics , one must look back at purely kinematical ( e.g.  time - of - flight ) observations .",

    "in particular , although order - of - magnitude constraints have been obtained on high energy lv in the hadronic sector , a complete reconstruction of the uhecr spectrum recently led to more robust constraints , which are as strong as @xmath241 and @xmath242 for dimension 6 lv coefficients for protons and pions , respectively @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino sector is still largely unexplored , in spite of the very low energies at which threshold effects should be affected by high energy lv in eft .",
    "this is mainly due to the difficulty of theoretically reconstructing and experimentally observing neutrino spectra at high energy .",
    "still , one may hope that planned future experiments in neutrino astrophysics may eventually provide the much needed information to further explore this sm sector .",
