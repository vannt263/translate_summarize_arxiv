    "in the last few decades one - dimensional quantum integrable models have proved to be immensely fertile theoretical laboratories for studying nonperturbative effects in strongly - correlated systems .",

    "significant further progress in the field has been obtained based on the fundamental breakthrough computations of certain forms of scalar products @xcite and of matrix elements of physical operators @xcite from the underlying algebraic structure of the models ( most economically expressed using the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite ) .    a significant open problem , which has up to now received little attention , consists in asking how a generic but well - defined quantum state overlaps with eigenfunctions of a certain integrable model . for example",
    ", one might ask how a spin chain state built from well - defined spin projections at each site projects onto eigenstates of a bethe ansatz - solvable @xcite hamiltonian .",
    "such overlaps form the basic building blocks of a recently - proposed approach to address out - of - equilibrium dynamics in integrable systems @xcite , but their calculation including the required knowledge of their scaling in the thermodynamic limit poses significant challenges . for the lieb - liniger bose gas @xcite , an analytic expression for certain overlaps ( namely of the condensate - like state with eigenstates at finite interaction ) has been recently found @xcite .",
    "similar results for the xxz model @xcite are not yet known .    in this work",
    "we derive a practical determinant expression for the overlap of the nel state with parity - invariant bethe states of the xxz model , starting from the original determinant formula obtained in refs .",
    "the advantage of our expression is that it can be numerically evaluated for large system sizes , and that its thermodynamic limit can be extracted analytically .",
    "remarkably , it shows peculiar similarities with the determinant expression for the overlaps in the lieb - liniger model @xcite .",
    "although we do not fully understand the origin of these similarities at this stage , this coincidence is most probably not fortuitous , and points to possible deep - rooted and ` universal ' links between quench situations in different models .",
