    "the interaction between nucleons and several classes of heavy flavor hyperons is expected to be dominated by the long range interaction between the light flavor components of the baryons . as an example , the interaction between nucleons and the recently discovered double - charm hyperons  @xcite is mainly due to the interaction between the single light flavor quark in the double flavor hyperon and those in the nucleon . the color - neutral interaction between charm and light flavor quarks is either weak or of very short range . in the case of two - baryon states ,",
    "in which the interaction between the light flavor quarks is the dominant one , it should be possible to calculate the binding energy to a first approximation by modifying realistic phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interaction models to take into account the different numbers of light flavor quarks in the baryons  @xcite .",
    "this method is explored here .",
    "it is found to have at most qualitative value , however , due to the fact that the short range components of the extant realistic phenomenological nucleon - nucleon potentials are poorly constrained .",
    "its use should be limited to those potentials which do not have strong angular momentum dependence .",
    "the modification of the nucleon - nucleon interaction required for systems with different numbers of light flavor quarks is straightforward when the nucleon - nucleon interaction is expressed in terms of operators , which have well defined matrix elements in the quark model , and the strength of which may therefore be correspondingly rescaled from the nucleon - nucleon system to the two - baryon system under consideration . in this approach the radial behavior of the interaction components",
    "is determined by the phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interaction , without any need for a detailed microscopic quark model based derivation of the interaction .",
    "two - baryon systems that may  at least approximately  be described in this way are the following : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 as well as those with the nucleon ( @xmath7 ) replaced by the paired charm hyperon and finally also the corresponding states that involve beauty rather than charm hyperons .",
    "to the extent that the interaction between the strange and light flavor quarks may be neglected the interaction between @xmath2 hyperons and the corresponding charm hyperons may also be described in this way in a first approximation .",
    "in contrast the interactions of heavy flavor hyperons with zero isospin like the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 hyperons , which do not couple to pions , can not be approximated by rescaled versions of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the interaction between nucleons and charm and double - charm hyperons is weaker than that between the nucleons , because of the smaller number of light flavor quarks in the charm and double - charm hyperons .",
    "the weaker attractive interaction is largely compensated , however , by the weakening of the repulsive effect of the two - baryon kinetic energy that is caused by the larger masses of the charm and double - charm hyperons . as a consequence",
    "the calculated binding energies remain small and dependent on the details of the interaction model in the case of charm hyperons , and typically become large only in the case of systems of beauty hyperons .    here the interaction between the two - baryon states that are formed of nucleons and heavy flavor hyperons is calculated from the realistic phenomenological interaction models in refs .",

    "two - baryon states with isospin 1 hyperons are considered in section 3 .",
    "the results are summarized in the concluding discussion .",
    "two - particle states formed of heavy flavor isodoublet baryons are similar to the two - nucleon system in that they have a long range pion exchange interaction , and an attractive intermediate range component , which to a large extent may be attributed to two - pion exchange  @xcite . to the extent that the color - neutral interactions between their heavy flavor quarks is weak in comparison to the interaction between the light flavor quark components , the interaction may  to a first approximation",
    " be constructed by multiplication of the components of the nucleon - nucleon interaction by appropriate quark model scaling factors .",
    "the phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interaction is in general expressible in terms of rotational invariants of spin and isospin operators as well as momenta and angular momenta .",
    "the scaling factors for the strengths of the matrix elements of spin and isospin invariants for two baryon states of isodoublet baryons relative to the corresponding two - nucleon state matrix elements may be derived from the quark model matrix elements of the spin and isospin operators for light flavor quarks . for @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 )",

    "the investigation above considered the use of well known phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interaction models to approximately describe the interaction between nucleons and heavy flavor hyperons and to explore the possible existence of deuteron - like bound states of nucleons and heavy flavor hyperons .",
    "the method relies on quark model scaling factors for scaling the strengths of the different interaction components to the appropriate number of light flavor quarks in the heavy flavor hyperons considered . while straightforward in execution the method proved to be only of qualitative value because the large variation in the short range components of the different modern nucleon - nucleon interactions led to considerable scatter in the calculated binding energies of the two - baryon systems considered .",
    "another limitation is the fact that the quark model scaling factors for the angular momentum dependent interaction components , which relate to the light flavor quarks , do not reveal the expected dependence on the hyperon mass , which is suggested by the large @xmath14 limit of qcd @xcite .",
    "because of this the binding energy estimates that are obtained with the nijmegen and the avn interaction models should be viewed as more reliable than those obtained with the av18 interaction , which has a strong quadratic angular momentum interaction .    with these provisos ,",
    "the present results suggest that nucleons form bound states with @xmath15 hyperons in the isospin 0 state that have binding energies in the range between 3 and 14 mev . with somewhat less confidence nucleons are expected to form bound states with @xmath1 hyperons , with binding energies between 1 and 34 mev .",
    "such deuteron - like bound states of @xmath1 hyperons , and of @xmath16 as well as of @xmath1 and @xmath16 hyperons are also very likely , with binding energies in the range 90 - 120 mev .",
    "bound states of nucleons and @xmath17 hyperons are also likely , although their binding energy can not be estimated with much confidence by the present method .",
    "most likely states with low total isospin will be most strongly bound .    here",
    "the interactions between strange and light flavor quarks have been neglected . a more realistic description of the states that contain strange quarks , e.g. the @xmath2 or @xmath0 hyperons ,",
    "should be possible by using a rescaled baryon - baryon potential like the nijmegen nsc97 potential @xcite .",
    "however , due to the limited experimental data that is available to fit such potentials , this would also introduce additional uncertainties .",
