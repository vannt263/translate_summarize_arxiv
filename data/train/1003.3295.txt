    "the accurate knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) for asymmetric nuclear matter is important in understanding the structure of finite nuclei away from the stability line and critical issues in astrophysics .",
    "the eos for asymmetric nuclear matter is mainly governed by the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "indeed , significant progress has been made in understanding the behaviour of the symmetry energy at the subnormal densities from the analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy ion collision @xcite and from the available data for the neutron skin thickness of several nuclei @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy as extracted from the isospin diffusion data agree with the ones deduced from the isoscaling analyses of isotope ratios in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the experimental data on the isotopic dependence of the nuclear giant monopole resonance in even - a sn isotopes @xcite also provides some informations on the nuclear symmetry energy which is in agreement with those derived from the analyses of the isospin diffusion data .",
    "the behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy at supranormal densities is largely unknown",
    ". theoretically , at supranormal densities , even the issue of whether the symmetry energy increases or decreases with density still remains unresolved .",
    "the precise measurements of the properties of the compact stars and the transport model analyses of the heavy - ion collisions at intermediate and high energies can provide some constraints on the high density behaviour of the symmetry energy .",
    "the density dependence of symmetry energy obtained using the skyrme hartree - fock models have been confronted with the constraints extracted by analyzing the isospin diffusion data @xcite .",
    "the symmetry energy and its slope and the curvature parameter at the saturation density for only four out of 21 different parameter sets of the skyrme interactions are found to be consistent with the ones extracted from the isospin diffusion data @xcite .",
    "it may be pointed out that all of these four parameter sets are obtained by fitting the experimental data for the binding energies and charge radii for finite nuclei .",
    "scenario is not the same when the similar investigation @xcite is carried out using three different versions of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models , namely , ( i ) models with meson field self interaction ( ii ) models with density dependent meson - nucleon couplings and ( iii ) point coupling models without meson fields . out of 23 parameter sets of these rmf models ,",
    "only a few are found to yield symmetry energies and their density dependence which are consistent with the empirical constraints imposed by isospin diffusion data . in particular ,",
    "10 different parameter sets were considered for the model ( i ) , but , only two of them could yield behaviour of the symmetry energy consistent with the empirical constraints . both of these parameter sets are obtained using nuclear matter observables , instead of fit to the bulk properties of finite nuclei .",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy is studied also for several other parameter sets of the rmf model @xcite .",
    "none of these parameter sets yield acceptable results for the density dependence of the symmetry energy . very recently",
    "@xcite , density dependence of the symmetry energy has been studied using extended relativistic mean - field ( ermf ) model which includes the contributions from self and mixed interaction terms for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons upto the quartic order . even in the ermf model , the density dependence of the symmetry energy obtained for several parameter sets",
    "are found to be inadequate .",
    "one of the existing parameter set is fine tuned in ref .",
    "@xcite so that the resulting behaviour of the symmetry energy can fulfill the empirical constraints on them . however , this parameter set is not capable of reproducing the experimental data on the bulk properties of finite nuclei .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the ermf model , due to the presence of the various mixed interaction terms , can yield wide variations in the density dependence of the symmetry energy without affecting the quality of the fit to the bulk properties of finite nuclei @xcite .",

    "@xcite are either too low or quite high .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the density dependence of the symmetry energy using 26 different parameterizations of the ermf model .",
    "all the parameterizations of the ermf model considered are obtained by fitting the experimental data on the binding energy and charge radius for the finite nuclei .",
    "furthermore , these parameter sets yield the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath3pb nucleus which vary over a wide range from @xmath5 fm .",
    "we find that quite a few of these parameterizations can fulfill the empirical constraints on the symmetry energy .",

    "mixed interaction terms involving @xmath2-meson field enables one to vary the density dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient and the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei over a wide range without affecting the other properties of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the self interaction of @xmath1-mesons plays important role in varying the high density behaviour of the eos and also prevents instabilities in the calculation of the eos @xcite . on the other hand expectation value of the @xmath2-meson field",
    "is order of magnitude smaller than that for the @xmath1-meson field @xcite .",

    "the symmetry energy and its density dependence in the ermf model is mainly governed by values of the coupling strengths @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( eqs . [ eq : lbm ] and [ eq : lnon - lin ] ) . the strengths @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 determines the contributions of the mixed interaction terms which account for the coupling of the isoscalar @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons to the isovector @xmath2 mesons .",

    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , there is an overall decrease in the values of these coupling strengths with increase in @xmath40 .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the coupling strengths are nearly unity for @xmath71 fm .",
    "coincidently , for @xmath71 fm , the empirical constraints on the behaviour of the symmetry energy as extracted from the isospin diffusion data are also satisfied very well .",
    "the strengths @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 tend to vanish for higher values of @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , if the contributions of the mixed interaction terms in question are ignored , as in the case of the conventional rmf model , the parameters obtained by fit to the experimental data on the binding energy and charge radius would give rise to @xmath72 fm .",
    "the values of @xmath73 fm , as favoured by the isospin diffusion data , can be achieved within the conventional rmf model only at the expense of the quality of fit to the bulk properties of the finite nuclei .",
    "we would like to investigate the role of various mixed interaction terms which are crucial in determining the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "in particular , we investigate the effects of the terms which account for the coupling of the isoscalar @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons to the isovector @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the coupling constants for these terms are @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath66 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : lnon - lin ] ) .",
    "the term with coupling constant @xmath64 is of the cubic order in the meson fields . whereas , the terms with @xmath65 and @xmath66 are of quartic order in the meson fields .",
    "our objective is to delineate the effects of these cubic and quartic order mixed interaction terms . for this purpose ,",
    "we generate two different families of interactions . for the first family of interactions",
    "f1 , we put @xmath74 and fit the remaining coupling constants using appropriate set of experimental data for the bulk properties of finite nuclei .",
    "but , the coupling constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 are also included in the fit for the second family f2 .",
    "thus , the behaviour of the symmetry energy for the f1 family is governed by the coupling constants @xmath63 and @xmath64 only . in case of the f2 family , the behaviour of the symmetry energy depends additionally on @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "for both the families we obtain the parameter sets corresponding to different values of @xmath40 in the range of @xmath75 fm with fixed @xmath76 .",
    "the procedure for calibrating the parameters of the model as well as the set of experimental data for the binding energies and charge radii used here are exactly the same as in ref .",
    "in addition , the parameters are also subjected to the empirical constraints of eq .",
    "( [ eq : const ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot our results for the rms errors on the total binding energies and charge radii .",
    "we see that quality of the fits to the total binding energies and charge radii are more or less the same for both the f1 and f2 families of interactions , except for @xmath77 fm .",
    "therefore , it appears that the quartic order mixed interaction terms with coupling constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 are redundant .",
    "more precisely , one might say that the values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 can not be appropriately determined by the bulk properties of the finite nuclei .",
    "these quartic order terms might play important role in fixing the behaviour of the symmetry energy at supranormal densities which is largely unknown at present .",
    "it can be easily concluded from fig .",
