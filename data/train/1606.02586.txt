    "the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) is currently constructing swissfel , an x - ray free - electron laser ( fel ) designed to produce coherent , ultra - bright and ultra - short photon pulses in the wavelength range between 0.1 and 7  nm , with first pilot experiments scheduled for late 2017 @xcite . during the preparation phase of swissfel ,",
    "psi designed , built and operated a 250-mev photoinjector , the swissfel injector test facility ( sitf )  @xcite .",
    "its main purposes consisted in the detailed study of the generation , acceleration and time compression of high - brightness electron beams needed to drive a compact sase ( self - amplified spontaneous emission ) fel and in providing a platform for the development and test of accelerator and undulator components or systems planned for swissfel .",
    "several fel test facilities with varying objectives have operated at other labs , going back to the tesla test facility ( ttf ) at desy  @xcite , the photoinjector test facility at desy , zeuthen ( pitz )  @xcite , and the slac gun test facility ( gtf )  @xcite , followed by the sparc photoinjector  @xcite at infn frascati , the shanghai deep ultraviolet free - electron laser source ( sduv - fel )  @xcite , the spring8 compact sase source ( scss ) test accelerator at riken  @xcite , or , more recently , the pal - xfel injector test facility at the pohang accelerator laboratory ( pal )  @xcite , and further facilities are being constructed in this context , e.g. , the clara test facility at daresbury  @xcite . moreover , slac s next linear collider test accelerator ( nlcta )  @xcite has been used extensively for fel studies ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and reports on commissioning experience have been given for the injector of the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) at slac  @xcite and the fermi project at elettra sincrotrone trieste  @xcite .",
    "the primary focus of the sitf lied on the systematic characterization and optimization of the electron source up to and including the first bunch compression stage .",
    "the beam optimization was accomplished through the tuning of all relevant parameters including the gun laser , cathode properties , radiofrequency ( rf ) acceleration and beam optics setup .",
    "the aim of these efforts was to generate , and preserve after magnetic bunch compression , a high - brightness beam fulfilling the stringent requirements for driving an fel of compact and thus cost - effective design like swissfel . as the verification of such a high - brightness beam requires advanced beam instrumentation as well as excellent beam characterization methods , much emphasis was put on both of these areas at the sitf .",
    "the sitf operated between march 2010 and october 2014 , with installation and repair breaks in between , in various configurations allowing for a wide range of beam measurements and component tests . in the present report we give a review of the commissioning experience of the main subsystems and summarize the beam physics measurements performed at the test facility .",

    "section  [ sec : undulator ] is dedicated to the undulator prototype test performed at the sitf . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our work and give a brief outlook on swissfel .",
    "the sitf was conceived as a split rf photoinjector followed by a booster linac , a magnetic bunch compression chicane and a diagnostic section .",
    "the facility was housed in a dedicated building at psi , the laboratory hall wlha , which was constructed in the years 2008 and 2009 and includes a shielding tunnel for the beam line .",
    "the design of the facility  @xcite benefited from several conceptual and experimental insights in injector design gained in the last three decades .",
    "in particular the design is based on the concepts of emittance compensation  @xcite and invariant envelope matching  @xcite , as well as the effective working point found by ferrario et al .",
    "@xcite during the redesign of the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) and later confirmed by measurements performed at the sparc photoinjector  @xcite and , eventually , by the successful operation of the lcls facility  @xcite .",
    "further guiding principles were given by the need for an azimuthally symmetric beam at low energy to provide an equal space - charge density in the vertical and horizontal plane , the preference for a relatively low bunch charge ( compared to earlier x - ray fel designs ) , allowing for a smaller laser spot size on the cathode and thus resulting in a smaller thermal emittance contribution , the minimization of nonlinearities and nonuniformities in the bunch slice parameters ( good slice matching ) and the aim for a small @xmath0-function to minimize chromatic effects in the focusing quadrupole magnets .    a schematic representation of the layout of the facility in its initial configuration is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] .",
    "the electron source is a laser - driven s - band ( 3  ghz ) rf gun . during the first four years of operation , until april 2014",
    ", electrons were produced with an rf gun originally built for the clic test facility ( ctf ) at cern , the ctf gun no .",
    "v  @xcite , kindly lent by cern to psi .",
    "later , the psi - built swissfel rf gun  @xcite was installed and used . in both cases ,",
    "the electrons were extracted by a laser pulse from an exchangeable copper cathode plug ( at later stages in some cases coated with cesium telluride ) and accelerated to an initial momentum of 7.1  mev/@xmath1 . from 2013",
    "onwards , the exchange of cathodes was facilitated by a load - lock chamber mounted onto the rf gun . immediately after the gun ,",
    "a movable solenoid magnet provides initial focusing and is used to optimize the emittance implementing the emittance compensation technique along the following 3  m long drift .",
    "the gun solenoid includes two weak , individually tunable quadrupole magnets ( normal and skew ) to correct potential quadrupole terms in the solenoid field  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a theoretical description of the correction scheme ) .",
    "the ensuing drift accommodates various low - energy beam diagnostics including a spectrometer arm at 30@xmath2 deflection angle for the measurement of beam energy and energy spread .",
    "the main accelerating section consists of four s - band traveling - wave structures boosting the beam energy to a nominal value of 270  mev .",
    "each of the structures is surrounded by four solenoid magnets for additional symmetric transverse focusing .",
    "the solenoids are each 75  cm long and provide magnetic fields up to 100  mt .",
    "the two downstream s - band structures are simultaneously used to generate , by off - crest acceleration , the energy chirp necessary for the longitudinal compression of the electron bunches in the magnetic four - dipole chicane after the booster .",
    "since the energy chirp generated in this way results in a curved longitudinal phase - space distribution , a fourth - harmonic cavity ( x - band , 12  ghz ) is operated upstream of the bunch compressor for the linearization of the longitudinal phase space , thereby suppressing the development of peaks in the head and tail of the current profile of the compressed bunch .",
    "this linearization includes the compensation of second - order terms arising from the bunch compression process . under normal conditions ,",
    "the harmonic cavity has a net decelerating effect on the bunch centroid , reducing the beam energy to the nominal final energy of 250  mev .",
    "the matching of the beam optics to the design optics is accomplished with five quadrupole magnets upstream of the chicane .",
    "after the bunch compressor the beam enters an extensive diagnostic section optimized for bunch length and emittance measurements .",
    "an array of quadrupole magnets allows the implementation of numerous optics schemes , in particular to perform various kinds of optics - based measurements of emittance and twiss parameters .",
    "the initial configuration of the diagnostics section , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] , included a focus - drift - defocus - drift ( fodo ) channel for the measurement of emittance using multiple screens inside the fodo cells , as an alternative to single or multiple quadrupole scan techniques .",
    "the fodo option was lost in the course of the modification of the diagnostics beam line to accommodate an undulator prototype in early 2014 . at this point , however , the quadrupole scan methods had already been firmly established as being both more robust and more precise .",
    "a vertically deflecting s - band rf cavity located after a few more matching quadrupoles beyond the bunch compressor can be used to streak the bunch , thus enabling the measurement of bunch length and slice parameters with a screen at a suitable distance . immediately before the beam dump , a high - energy spectrometer , consisting of a deflecting dipole magnet ( 6@xmath2 bending angle ) , a straight and a dispersive section allows momentum and momentum spread of the final electron beam to be measured .",
    "it can also be used in combination with the transverse deflecting cavity for the detailed imaging of the longitudinal phase space . at various positions along the entire beam line ,",
    "transverse beam profiles can be obtained by imaging the beam with insertable screens , consisting of crystals ( yag : ce or luag : ce ) emitting scintillation light or thin metal foils emitting optical transition radiation ( otr ) .",
    "the beam orbit and charge transmission is monitored by a series of resonant stripline beam position monitors ( bpms ) .",
    "additional cavity - based bpms were installed for test purposes along the straight section of the high - energy spectrometer .",
    "a wall current monitor in the gun section provides a measurement of the absolute bunch charge with an uncertainty of 1015% and serves as a calibration for the bpm charge measurements .",
    "additional information on the bunch charge can be obtained from a few prototype integrating current transformers installed along the beam line .",
    "figure  [ fig : optics ] shows a typical beam optics setting , as it was applied for the main measurements related to beam characterization and optimization described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bd - results ] .",
    "the main design aims leading to this choice of optics are :    * small @xmath0-functions ( @xmath3  m ) throughout the lattice ; * a small horizontal @xmath0-function between the third and fourth dipole magnet of the bunch compression chicane to limit potential detrimental effects from coherent synchrotron radiation ; * adequate time resolution for longitudinal bunch measurements with the rf deflector at a profile monitor in the high - energy spectrometer ; * appropriate energy resolution at the high - energy spectrometer ; * proper optics for the emittance measurement ( in this case based on a single - quadrupole scan , see sec .",

    "the sitf was designed for two standard bunch charge modes , a high - charge mode with 200  pc bunch charge , and a low - charge mode with 10  pc , in accordance with the planned swissfel bunch charge range of 10200  pc .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ ff84_tab1 ]    for swissfel , electron bunch compression monitors based on cdr are planned to be installed after the first and the second bunch compressor .",
    "since the operation of the monitors requires the insertion of a foil with a hole into the beam pipe , they will not be entirely parasitic .",
    "for this reason , alternative bunch length monitors based on coherent edge and synchrotron radiation from the bunch compressors last dipole magnets will also be installed at swissfel .",
    "it is expected that the intensity from coherent edge radiation is higher than the cdr intensity .",
    "these monitors , along with a further optimization of the high - pass thz filter , may allow us to achieve the rf phase resolution goal also in the case of the s - band rf phase .",
    "a bunch length monitor based on the electro - optic effect was developed for swissfel  @xcite and tested at the sitf  @xcite .",
    "the measurement principle , known as electro - optic spectral decoding , is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eomscheme ] . a chirped laser pulse , i.e. , with time - to - wavelength correlation , is linearly polarized and sent through a 2  mm thick gap crystal installed in the vacuum beam pipe .",
    "the laser polarization is changed in the crystal via the electro - optic effect caused by the electric field of the passing electron bunch .",
    "a second polarizer after the crystal turns the polarization modulation into an intensity modulation with time - to - wavelength correlation known from a direct calibration procedure .",
    "the bunch profile can then be reconstructed from the intensity pattern measured by a grating spectrometer .",
    "since the technique is nondestructive it can be used for the online monitoring of the bunch length on a pulse - to - pulse basis at rates up to 200  hz , restricted only by the spectrometer readout .",
    "one of the studies conducted at the sitf was dedicated to the measurement of the resolution limit of the electro - optic monitor . to this end ,",
    "electron bunches with 200  mev energy were compressed in the magnetic chicane and measured under the same conditions with both the electro - optic monitor and the transverse deflecting cavity , which has a resolution well below 100  fs ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : long ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the bunch lengths obtained with the two methods is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eomtdc ] and indicates saturation of the electro - optic monitor at about 350  fs .",
    "the main resolution limiting factor for this method was found to be the frequency mixing effect ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the crystal installed at the sitf ,",
    "the best resolution that can be expected is around 200  fs .        for budget reasons , electro - optic monitors",
    "are not included in the current plans for swissfel .",
    "it is possible , however , that such monitors may be added in a future upgrade of the swissfel beam diagnostics system .      for the monitoring and optimization of the longitudinal linac stability",
    ", the swissfel concept foresees the nondestructive measurement of the electron bunch arrival time at several locations with resolution better than 10  fs .",
    "two prototype setups of such bunch arrival - time monitors ( bam ) have been installed and tested at the sitf , one upstream and , later , one downstream of the bunch compression chicane . to meet the swissfel requirement of time resolution below 10  fs in the entire bunch charge range between 10 and 200 pc ,",
    "these prototypes have undergone several iterations towards an optimal use of the component bandwidths and an improved signal - to - noise ratio at low bunch charges . in the following",
    "we describe the general design of the swissfel bam system and its implementation at the sitf ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bam - design ] ) , as well as the evaluation of rf pickups ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bam - pickups ] ) for swissfel .    at the sitf",
    ", the bams have been used to characterize bunch arrival - time drift and jitter  @xcite , beam energy jitter  @xcite , as well as the longitudinal dispersion ( the @xmath10 parameter ) of the bunch compression chicane . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bam - drift ] we give a brief account of the arrival - time drift and jitter measurement .",
    "the longitudinal dispersion measurement is described later in the section on bunch compressor characterization ( [ sec : bc - char ] ) . for the beam energy jitter measurement",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the swissfel bam concept is based on a mach  zehnder - type electro - optic modulator ( eom )  @xcite , which is interfaced to an optical master oscillator ( omo , see also sec .",
    "[ sec : refgen ] ) .",
    "the omo is a phase - locked - loop stabilized mode - locked laser oscillator with a wavelength of 1560  nm and a repetition rate of 214.137  mhz .",
    "it delivers reference pulses of a few 100  fs duration to the bam stations via single - mode optical fiber links , whose lengths are stabilized via optical cross - correlation  @xcite .",
    "this pulsed optical reference is highly stable against drift and jitter , at a level below 10  fs .    an electron bunch passing through the beam pipe at the location of the bam generates an s - shaped bipolar transient with a steep slope in an rf vacuum pickup in the beam pipe .",
    "the pickup signal is transmitted to the rf port of an eom , which is dc biased in quadrature ( i.e. , the optical signal is reduced to half its nominal amplitude at the output ) .",
    "these eoms are part of the electro - optic front - end , which is housed in an enclosing ( the `` bam box '' ) close to the beam pipe to avoid bandwidth losses in the rf cables leading to the eom .",
    "the box is temperature stabilized via its base plate at 28@xmath2c to within 0.01@xmath2c and shielded against neutrons and x - rays .",
    "two eoms are available in the front - end , which provides the flexibility to operate in high - sensitivity as well as high - dynamic - range configurations .",
    "the second channel operates at the same zero crossing as the first but uses a separate pair of pickups .",
    "furthermore , the slew rate is filtered for that channel such that the rf slope is less inclined , resulting in a larger dynamic range of the bam . at the sitf ,",
    "the second eom channel was mainly used to simultaneously test different eoms , rf pickups or other rf components such as attenuators or limiters .    accommodating the end of the optical fiber link ,",
    "the bam box also houses two erbium - doped fiber amplifiers ( edfa ) and a faraday rotating mirror ( frm ) .",
    "the first edfa , which is part of the optical link and precedes the frm , serves as an actuator for the link amplitude feedback loop .",
    "after the frm the second edfa ( out of loop ) controls the power sent to the bam photoreceiver ( see below ) .    in the eom the rf pickup signal",
    "is sampled at zero crossing by one of the reference ( omo ) laser pulses .",
    "the coincidence between a laser pulse and the zero crossing of the rf signal is ensured by setting the laser timing accordingly .",
    "since the omo laser is locked to the superperiod of the machine reference , this zero - crossing overlap provides an absolute timing reference to any device that is locked to the same superperiod ( for instance the gun laser ) .",
    "any temporal offset due to a change in the electron time of flight leads to an additional positive or negative voltage input at the eom s rf port , thereby increasing or decreasing the amplitude modulation of the one reference laser pulse which overlaps with the electron bunch .",
    "thus the bunch arrival time is encoded in the amplitude of a single reference laser pulse , while all the other pulses remain unaffected ( i.e. , premodulated to half amplitude ) .",
    "the optical pulses from the two bam channels are received , together with a sampling clock signal , in a data acquisition back - end located in the technical gallery outside the accelerator tunnel .",
    "the sampling clock is generated by the same reference pulse train , split in the bam box before the eom .",
    "the pulses are conditioned in an in - house designed optical photoreceiver module before being readout by a fast 12-bit analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) with 500  mhz bandwidth .",
    "the data acquisition chain is synchronous to the bunch rate .",
    "the photoreceiver module uses high - bandwidth photodiodes followed by bandpass filters and high - dynamic - range transimpedance amplifiers .",
    "the bandpass filters extract either the sine component of the sampling clock or quasi - gaussian pulses , with 90  ps broad peaks and a few nanoseconds long intervals with a flat baseline in between , from the bam signals . after the pulse form manipulation , the reference laser pulses",
    "are additionally amplified and matched to the adc input . to ensure the optimal use of the adc dynamic range in view of a better time resolution ,",
    "a dac module ( the psi analogue carrier board , pac  @xcite ) , providing additional dc offset and amplitude control , should be used .",
    "( this module only became available for the second bam station downstream of the bunch compressor . )",
    "the adc does not sample a waveform , but only the peak or baseline points of a large number of reference laser pulses , most of which precede the pulse that is modulated by the electron bunch .",
    "therefore , a single - shot measurement determines not only the bunch arrival time , but also the error limiting the resolution due to the laser amplitude jitter and the influence of the subsequent opto - electronic chain . in other words",
    "the bam is a self - referenced system capable of measuring its own resolution on a shot - to - shot basis .",
    "the bam resolution is essentially a function of the slew rate of the rf transient and the effective amplitude jitter of the reference laser pulses , as measured by the adc . for our system",
    ", the latter effect was found to dominate .",
    "the measured effective laser amplitude fluctuations vary between 0.25% and 0.3% .",
    "since both the sampling clock and the signal are generated from the same optical pulse train , the adc sampling position on the reference laser pulse remains unchanged under temporal shifts of the laser reference .",
    "such temporal shifts of the laser are brought about , for instance , during the calibration of the system , when the modulated laser pulse is scanned over the rf transient to map the extent of the amplitude modulation to the laser delay . in a similar vein , a dedicated delay stage in the bam box",
    "is applied to run a zero - crossing feedback : each time the bunch arrival time exceeds a predefined limit determined by the slope of the rf transient , the reference laser pulse is shifted back to the zero crossing , thereby keeping the bam acquisition within the dynamic range of the transient .",
    "two types of rf pickups were evaluated in the first bam station ( upstream of the bunch compressor ) , a button and a ridge waveguide , both mounted on a common 38  mm vacuum chamber  @xcite .",
    "the ridge wave guide features a high coupling strength to support measurements at low bunch charges and an intrinsic bandwidth of 16  ghz .",
    "measurements with this pickup type revealed a strongly nonuniform bunch charge dependence of the bam signal with maximum slew rates ( resulting in the best bam resolution ) around 100  pc bunch charge and dropping again at higher charges . in view of the limited dynamic range with respect",
    "to bunch charge , this design was considered impractical for swissfel .",
    "the button pickup is designed as a 50  @xmath11 coaxial line , starting with a cone shaped tip with 2.5  mm base and smoothly tapered over the 28  mm length to a coaxial glass - bead feedthrough and a 2.92  mm connector .",
    "its nominal intrinsic bandwidth is 80  mhz .",
    "test results obtained with the button pickup show a uniform bunch charge dependence .",
    "the slew rates , however , are limited by the coupling strength at low bunch charges and by the feedthrough bandwidth of 20  ghz .",
    "based on this experience , the initial plan for swissfel was to increase the coupling strength by shortening the 50  @xmath11 coaxial line to 6  mm and by extending the bandwidth of the feedthrough to 40  ghz .",
    "the design diameter of the button remained at 2.5  mm and is a compromise between signal strength and bandwidth ( 40  ghz ) .",
    "the production of such vacuum feedthroughs , however , turned out to be a substantial technical challenge .",
    "two approaches were pursued , one based on commercial high - bandwidth bore - silicate glass beads and another wherein a kovar glass is directly sintered to the flange .",
    "unfortunately the corresponding prototypes turned out to be both costly and time - consuming in production and did not meet the design specifications .",
    "we therefore decided to abandon this development and started testing two pickup prototypes developed by tu darmstadt and desy  @xcite .",
    "the second bam station at the sitf , positioned after the bunch compression chicane is equipped with rf pickups of this type .",
    "the arrival time resolutions obtained with this bam station , using an rf pickup prototype adapted to the swissfel 16  mm vacuum chamber , are 35  fs for a bunch charge of 10  pc , 20  fs for 20  pc and vary in the range from 13  fs down to 7  fs for bunch charges between 30  pc and 200  pc . for the swissfel bam stations in the undulator section , where the beam pipe diameter is only 8  mm , a further improvement in resolution at low bunch charges by about a factor of two",
    "is expected .",
    "an example of a long - term bunch - arrival - time measurement performed with the bam located upstream of the bunch compressor over approximately eight hours is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : bamdrift ] . for this measurement , the nd :",
    "ylf based gun laser system was used , locked to the 1498.956  mhz rf master oscillator and to the machine superperiod .",
    "the average bunch charge during the measurement period was 130  pc .",
    "the optical fiber link was stabilized with an accuracy of 21  fs . during the run",
    "the link motor had to compensate up to 47  fs of fiber drift ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bamdrift ] , lower plot ) .",
    "a feedback ensures that the bam acquisition is always kept near the zero crossing of the bam pickup slope .",
    "the resolution is 20  fs , which was typical for our initial pickup design , where the bandwidth was limited by the vacuum feedthroughs ( 20  ghz ) and the electro - optic intensity modulators ( 12  ghz ) .",
    "the bunch arrival - time drift , determined as a sliding average over 100 shots ( i.e. , approximately 10  s ) , is 410  fs ( peak - to - peak ) over the 8 hour period . during this period several rf interlocks occurred , leading to beam interruptions visible as data gaps in the drift plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bamdrift ] , upper plot ) .",
    "after recovery of the rf the bam acquisition was resumed automatically .",
    "the middle plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : bamdrift ] shows the jitter , defined as the deviation of the instantaneous arrival time from the smoothed average described above .",
    "the jitter ranges between 70 and 150  fs , with an rms value of 110  fs .",
    "similar jitter values were obtained even before the commissioning of the optical fiber link .",
    "a substantial fraction of the observed jitter arises from the gun laser amplifier and transfer lines after the stabilized laser oscillator .",
    "a dedicated laser arrival - time monitor is currently under development for swissfel with the goal of characterizing and mitigating this effect  @xcite .",
    "in addition to advanced beam diagnostics , the detailed characterization of the electron beam generated at the sitf also relied on elaborate methods and procedures , which first needed to be established at our facility , and later refined and adapted for routine use . in this section , we describe these procedures , before presenting the main results in sec .",
    "[ sec : bd - results ] .",
    "the detailed knowledge of the lattice acting on the beam is essential for the proper interpretation of all beam physics measurements .",
    "we present our efforts to characterize and adjust the beam orbit in all parts of the machine , including the effects of the bunch - compressor and geomagnetic dipole fields .",
    "all machine components were mechanically aligned during the installation phase with a precision better than 100  m. in addition , a beam - based alignment was performed for those beam - line components that are relevant for beam optics measurements .    for the beam - based alignment of the rf gun elements",
    ", we essentially follow the procedures described in ref .  @xcite . in a first step , the laser position on the cathode of the electron gun is adjusted to the central axis of the gun rf field . in the case of the ctf gun , this is determined by the center of the dark current halo , as it can be observed on one of the first view screens of the gun section with gun solenoid and laser both turned off . the position of the laser spot on the cathode is then adjusted until the photoelectron beam and the dark current halo are concentric . during the procedure ,",
    "all corrector dipole magnets between the gun and the view screen are turned off since in general the energy of the dark current electrons differs from that of the photoelectrons . to improve the visibility of the photoelectron beam on the screen",
    ", the rf phase is shifted towards the phase of maximum charge extraction , resulting in a focusing of the photoelectron beam by the rf field , and the rf gradient is reduced by 1020% to increase the contrast between the dark current halo and the photoelectron beam .    the laser position found in first approximation by centering on the dark current halo may be further readjusted by verifying that the beam position on the screen is insensitive to changes of the gun rf phase . in the case of the swissfel gun ( from april 2014 on ) , the amount of dark current produced was insufficient for the simple alignment procedure based on the dark current halo and an rf phase scan was needed for the laser alignment .",
    "once the gun laser spot is fixed , the gun solenoid is aligned by minimizing the movement of the photoelectron beam , again observed on one of the first view screens of the gun section , in response to changes in the strength of the solenoid field .",
    "the gun solenoid is mounted on a motorized support with four degrees of freedom ( the longitudinal position and the rotation angle around the beam axis are fixed ) . for a large variation of the solenoid excitation current from 20 to 150",

    "as one of the principal objectives of the sitf consisted in the demonstration of a high - brightness beam capable of driving a sase fel , the beam development program focused on minimizing the transverse beam emittance at the source and on preserving the small emittance under beam transport , acceleration , and , in particular , compression .",

    "the electron emission process at the gun cathode sets a fundamental lower limit on the achievable beam emittance and thus has a strong influence on the final emittance of rf photoinjectors .",
    "for instance , simulations performed for swissfel indicate that for an optimized machine , around 70% of the final emittance is due to the emittance related to the cathode , also called intrinsic emittance . at the sitf much effort went into characterizing the intrinsic emittance of cathodes and finding ways to minimize it .",
    "the intrinsic emittance of the cathode is related to the initial kinetic energy or effective temperature of the electrons emitted from the cathode . for laser - illuminated photocathodes , made of metal or semiconductor ,",
    "the intrinsic emittance may be expressed as  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the rms laser beam size , @xmath55 the average kinetic energy of the photo - emitted electrons , and @xmath56 the electron s rest mass energy .",

    "apart from the cathode surface quality ( described by @xmath0 ) , the intrinsic emittance of a photoinjector is thus influenced by three main parameters under our control :    * the photon energy , given by the wavelength of the gun laser , affecting directly the energy of the photo - emitted electrons , * the applied field on the cathode , determining the size of the schottky effect , and * the cathode material , specifying the work function in the case of a metal or the gap energy and the electron affinity in the case of a semiconductor .    at the sitf",

    "we extract the specific intrinsic emittance @xmath69 from measurements of the emittance at the final booster energy as a function of the laser beam size on the cathode , controlled by adjusting the size of a circular laser aperture .",
    "special care must be taken to minimize or subtract possible contributions to the emittance arising after the emission at the cathode , e.g. , from space - charge and rf - field effects .    to eliminate space - charge effects ,",

    ", the bunch charge is adjusted to keep the surface charge density constant .",
    "possible chromatic and dispersive effects along the bunch are minimized by keeping the electron energy approximately constant along the bunch by means of on - crest acceleration in the booster .",
    "furthermore , to avoid a possible impact on the projected emittance from the gun rf field variation experienced by the bunch along its longitudinal extension , we only consider the slice emittance at the core of the bunch .",
    "this core slice emittance is obtained by dividing the bunch into typically ten slices per rms bunch length and averaging the measured slice emittance over an appropriate number of slices around the longitudinal center of the bunch .",
    "most of our intrinsic emittance measurements were performed with the ctf gun ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : rf - gun ] ) , which features a symmetric rf feed design to avoid dipolar kicks , but has no compensation of quadrupolar fields acting on the electron beam .",
    "these quadrupolar fields lead to a quadratic rise of the emittance as a function of the laser spot size .",
    "we take this additional component into account by fitting a quadratic function to the measurements , thereby obtaining the specific intrinsic emittance as the linear coefficient of the fit function .",
    "additional measurements performed with the new swissfel gun show that the quadratic effect is less pronounced in this case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : apert - scan ] we compare two examples of aperture scans performed with the two rf guns .",
    "the most relevant results of our systematic emittance studies with copper cathodes are that the intrinsic emittance of such cathodes can indeed be reduced by about 20% when tuning the laser wavelength from 262  nm to 276  nm  @xcite and that a similar reduction can be achieved by lowering the rf gradient at the extraction phase from 49.9  mv / m to 16.4  mv / m  @xcite .",
    "the wavelength tuning measurements confirm earlier studies  @xcite carried out with a combined diode rf electron gun  @xcite .",
    "these observed reductions apply to individual cathodes measured under the same operating conditions within a relatively short time . measuring various cathodes at different times with respect to their installations we found that variations in intrinsic emittance between different cathodes , originating , e.g. , from differences in surface quality , as well as degradation effects are also in the 20% range .",
    "therefore such effects can easily outweigh any benefits gained from laser - wavelength or rf - gradient tunings , which , however , come at the expense of significant losses in quantum efficiency .",
    "similarly , our comparison between copper and cesium telluride cathodes resulted in emittance values for the two types of cathodes that lie in the same range  @xcite : for both cathode materials we obtained values between about 0.4  m / mm and 0.6  m / mm for the specific intrinsic emittance .",
    "earlier measurements performed on copper cathodes in the context of the development of the lcls at slac generally gave higher values  @xcite , whereas a previous psi experiment based on a combined diode rf electron gun resulted in a specific intrinsic emittance of around 0.5  m / mm for this material  @xcite . in the case of cesium telluride , experiments at the photoinjector test facility at desy , zeuthen ( pitz ) , also indicated a higher specific intrinsic emittance  @xcite , whereas estimates based on the observed electron emission spectrum  @xcite agree with our measurements .",
    "some of the laser - beam - size scans involved emittance measurements at extremely low bunch charges .",
    "for instance , the measurement with the smallest laser aperture at the lowest rf gradient was done on a bunch with only 30  fc charge .",
    "the beam slices , for which individual emittances were determined in this measurement , contain around 1  fc of charge ; in other words they are made up of a few thousand electrons only .",
    "the measured normalized core slice emittance in this case was slightly below 25  nm  @xcite .",
    "given our experimental results on intrinsic emittance , the options of tuning the wavelength of the gun laser or the rf gradient of the photoinjector gun will not be pursued further at swissfel .",
    "moreover the baseline cathode material for the swissfel injector has been changed from copper to cesium telluride , since it provides a quantum efficiency about two orders of magnitude higher at comparable intrinsic emittance ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : cath ] ) . the copper option will be maintained nevertheless , for the case of major problems with the production or operation of the cesium telluride cathodes .",
    "apart from the mitigation of emittance dilution effects , the optimization of an rf photoinjector involves trade - offs between the contributions to the beam emittance related to the intrinsic emittance at the cathode , space charge and rf fields . to minimize the emittance at the sitf",

    "the numerical optimization is based on simulations using the astra code  @xcite coupled to a dedicated optimizer developed for swissfel  @xcite .",
    "the optimizer minimizes both the emittance and the mismatch along the central part of the bunch ( 75% of the total length ) at the exit of the second booster structure , via the construction of an appropriate figure of merit .",
    "the main parameters to be optimized are the distance between the gun and the first booster structure , the transverse laser spot size and the gun solenoid focusing strength . in the optimization procedure ,",
    "as applied to the sitf design , the gun gradient is kept at its nominal value ( see sec .  [",

    "one of the most important consequences of the numerical optimization was an increase of the distance between the gun and the first booster structure by about 20  cm  @xcite with respect to the original design , which was based on the ferrario working point  @xcite .",
    "the laser spot size determined by the numerical optimization for the 200  pc case serves as a starting point for the empirical optimization .",
    "the 10  pc bunch is simply reduced in all dimensions to have the same three - dimensional charge density .",

    ", the laser pulse length defining the bunch length is treated as a given , originating from the design of the machine  @xcite . in the last operating months of the sitf",
    ", however , we performed a systematic study of the effect of the laser pulse length on the emittance both for uncompressed and compressed beams .",
    "the study was carried through with the swissfel gun using a cesium telluride cathode .",
    "optimizing the beam separately for the design case with a laser pulse length of 9.9  ps and for two additional cases with laser pulse lengths of 5  ps and 2.5  ps ( fwhm ) , we found no improvement either in emittance or in brightness when going to shorter laser pulse lengths .",
    "bunch compression utilizing path length differences in a dispersive section , such as a magnetic chicane , has become a well established technique ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the swissfel design foresees two such bunch compressors to achieve final rms bunch lengths between 2 and 25  fs , depending on the bunch charge .",
    "the first stage of this compression scheme was tested at the sitf with the magnetic chicane described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bc ] .",
    "indeed the demonstration of bunch compression with acceptable degradation of beam quality represented one of the main goals of the sitf experimental program .",
    "our compression setup procedure is based on an analytical derivation of the rf parameters needed to arrive at a certain bunch length for a given configuration ( @xmath10 ) of the bunch compressor . in this procedure",
    "the first two booster structures are used for acceleration only ( operating at their on - crest phases ) , whereas the last two booster structures are used for acceleration and energy chirping ( operating at an appropriate common off - crest phase ) .",
    "the higher - harmonic x - band structure is operated at the on - crest phase providing maximum deceleration to linearize the longitudinal phase space , including the compensation of second - order terms induced by the bunch compressor .",
    "this structure is not normally used to further modify the energy chirp .    for the case of the sitf , with one bunch compression chicane and without strong longitudinal wake - field interactions from c - band linacs , it is possible to derive an analytic description of the compression setup .",
    "( for swissfel with two bunch compressors and a c - band linac , such a straightforward approach is no longer applicable and a semi - analytical model following ref .",
    "@xcite will be adopted . )    in practice , we start the compression setup by determining the incident energy before the chirping structures , which is necessary in order to compute the appropriate compression parameters for a given target bunch length .",
    "our derivation of the compression parameters also assumes zero incoming energy chirp .",
    "we therefore , in a second step , remove a potential incoming energy chirp originating from the gun by observing the streaked beam in the final spectrometer in response to small variations in the phase of the second booster structure .    to facilitate the ensuing optics matching of the compressed beam",
    ", the uncompressed beam at the final energy is matched .",
    "we then generate the required energy chirp by going to the predetermined off - crest phase , while simultaneously compensating for the energy loss by increasing the amplitude in the last two structures accordingly .",
    "the amplitude of the x - band structure , operating at the on - crest decelerating phase , is then ramped up until its induced energy loss matches the value expected from the compression scheme , as confirmed directly with the spectrometer .",
    "the associated energy loss is again compensated by a corresponding adjustment in the amplitude of the last two booster structures .",
    "finally , the optics of the compressed beam are rematched , and the compression factor is verified with a bunch - length measurement .    following this procedure we can reliably establish compression factors up to about 12 with a target accuracy of 1020% , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compression ] .",
    "small adjustments of the compression phase are then sufficient for the further fine tuning of the bunch length .          preliminary compression experiments , using the flattop - like ti : sapphire laser pulses built up from pulse stacking ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsarlong ] ) to generate electrons from a copper cathode , resulted in a strong fragmentation of the electron phase space into pronounced energy bands .",
    "similar distortions of the longitudinal phase space after compression have been observed at other facilities  @xcite .",
    "the phase space fragmentation has an adverse impact on beam emittance and energy spread and compromises the emittance measurement itself .",
    "it also aggravates the risk of further beam degradation with respect to fel performance through the microbunching instability  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasespace ] shows two examples of fragmented phase space distributions , measured in the dispersive section of the high - energy spectrometer while simultaneously streaking the beam with the rf deflector .",

    "the magenta lines are projections of the distributions onto the horizontal ( energy ) axis , emphasizing the fragmentation effect . ]    to avoid complications from this effect without changing the photocathode material , the optimization of the compressed beam , as described in the following section , was continued with the nd : ylf laser , which delivers relatively smooth gaussian pulses ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jaguarlong ] ) .    the problem of phase space fragmentation arising from the longitudinal charge modulation induced by the pulse - stacked laser profile can also be mitigated by choosing a photocathode material with a response time longer than the characteristic temporal substructure of the laser pulse . at the sitf",
    "we have verified that a cesium telluride cathode provides enough time spread to smooth out significantly the phase space of electron bunches generated with a pulse - stacked laser profile , even after strong compression , see fig .  [ fig : phasespace2 ] . this observation provided strong additional support for the choice of cesium telluride as baseline photocathode material for swissfel .",
    "further suppression of the microbunching instability at swissfel will be achieved with a laser heater system  @xcite based on conceptual  @xcite and experimental  @xcite work carried out for the lcls project at slac .    .",
    "the applied compression factor is 6 , corresponding to the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] . ]",
    "the first round of emittance measurements on compressed beams , performed with a smooth longitudinal laser profile and at moderate compression factors between 5 and 10 , indicated a significant increase in the core slice emittance resulting from the compression , similar to earlier observations made at flash  @xcite and lcls  @xcite .",
    "systematic studies showed that the observed emittance growth is independent of the beam energy , but does increase with the dipole bending angle in the bunch compressor ( at constant compression factor )  @xcite . deliberately degrading the emittance of the incoming beam we also found that the emittance increase mainly occurs for beams with low initial emittance , whereas an already large emittance is hardly affected by the compression .",
    "furthermore , a strong dependence of the emittance growth on the beam optics along the bunch compressor was observed .",
    "for instance , a change of one unit in the horizontal @xmath37-function at the entrance of the bunch compressor can lead to a relative increase of the core slice emittance of the compressed beam of up to 50% .",
    "numerical simulations using the csrtrack code  @xcite for the tracking along the bunch compressor qualitatively reproduce the observed behavior , if a 3d model based on the pseudo green s function  @xcite is used to describe the electron interactions , but not if the 1d model is selected . from this",
    "we infer that the emittance growth is due to 3d effects originating from coherent synchrotron radiation , but possibly also from other sources . a viable mitigation strategy therefore consists in minimizing the horizontal @xmath0-function at the location of the last two dipoles of the chicane , where the bunch length is reduced .",
    "by careful tweaking of the beam optics along the bunch compressor , varying the strengths of the last few quadrupoles in the matching section by a few percent or less only , we managed to preserve the core slice emittance to within about 10% for compression factors up to about 10 .",
    "figure  [ fig : emit_comp ] shows the result of three consecutive slice emittance measurements on a compressed beam , together with the current profile . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding measurements before compression are also plotted .        another conclusion from our studies , reported in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that great care must be taken when matching the beam in transport sections where it carries a large energy chirp , as is the case in front of a bunch compressor : chromatic effects acting on the energy - chirped bunch can give rise to a large slice mismatch along the bunch , with the effect that only a short part of the bunch fulfills the delicate beam optics conditions required to avoid emittance degradation during compression . a smooth optics in matching sections before bunch compressors , where focusing of an energy - chirped beam is required ,",
    "is therefore of vital importance .",
    "the final results of our emittance minimization efforts for both compressed and uncompressed beams are summarized in tables  [ tab : pars - high ] and [ tab : pars - low ] .",
    "apart from the beam optimization efforts described above , the sitf was used for a number of other beam dynamics studies as well as for beam - based tests of beam diagnostics and manipulation techniques during its time of operation .",
    "the detailed description of these additional developments is beyond the scope of this report and the reader is referred to the corresponding publications for more information .",
    "further studies performed at the sitf include :    * the evaluation and implementation of possible collimation strategies after the photocathode gun to limit the dark current transported further downstream  @xcite ; * a proof - of - principle experiment to test a new method for measuring longitudinal bunch profiles by utilizing the beam s interaction with the transverse wakefield self - induced by off - axis passage through a dielectric - lined or corrugated waveguide  @xcite ( see also sec .",

    "the availability of a well tuned , low - emittance electron beam at the sitf afforded the opportunity to perform a test of the swissfel hard - x - ray undulator design under realistic beam conditions .",
    "( the design of the swissfel soft - x - ray undulators had not yet been finalized at the time of sitf operation . ) to this end a prototype of the swissfel u15 undulator was installed in december 2013 and tested during the run period lasting from january to april 2014 .      the undulator test at the sitf provided opportunities    * to broadly verify  with respect to fel performance  essential quality features of both the electron beam and the undulator design under real operating conditions ( even if only at vacuum ultraviolet , vuv , and optical photon wavelengths ) , * to validate the undulator magnetic model as well as the results of the magnetic measurements directly with the help of the electron beam , and * to test the undulator alignment concept based on permanent quadrupole magnets .",
    "the primary goals of the experiment were therefore the observation and characterization of undulator radiation arising from the sase process , the systematic measurement of undulator induced orbit kicks as a function of the magnetic gap to uncover possible flaws in the undulator field , and the demonstration of the undulator alignment procedure .",
    "the 4  m long hybrid in - vacuum u15 undulator features a period length of 15  mm and a tunable undulator parameter , @xmath70 , between 0.1 and 1.8 , achieved with a movable gap , variable between 3 and 20  mm by means of a wedge based gap drive system .",
    "the u15 was designed for the swissfel hard - x - ray beam line based on the experience made at the sls with hybrid in - vacuum undulators  @xcite , with appropriate modifications for the specific requirements of a linac driven fel  @xcite .",
    "( the general concept of in - vacuum undulators was pioneered by spring-8  @xcite . )",
    "the relatively large number of identical units ( 13 ) planned for swissfel called for several design changes in order to benefit from an industrial series production . to provide more rigidity to the magnetic structure , a closed mineral cast frame design was chosen .",
    "the mineral cast option was selected in place of the more common metallic frame solution to reduce costs , mechanical vibrations and disturbances from stray fields .",
    "the entire frame is equipped with a five - axis camshaft mover system for remote positioning with micrometer precision .",
    "the new approach introduced additional constraints for the magnetic measurements and necessitated the development of a novel bench for the optimization and characterization of the undulator magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "the more modest requirements on the field quality for a single - pass machine allows for a smaller good - field region ( larger tolerance on multipole components ) , thereby reducing the magnetic forces and enabling higher @xmath70 values .",
    "a more complete description of the u15 design can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the u15 prototype undulator was subjected to the same preparation procedure as all u15 undulators built for swissfel .",
    "the undulator elements are delivered to psi in three distinct parts : the frame , equipped with the gap drive system , the magnetic array and the vacuum components .",
    "for the first set of measurements the magnetic array is assembled inside the frame .",
    "the trajectory and the phase errors are tuned adjusting the pole height for the nominal @xmath70 value ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "after carefully securing the positions of the magnets within the magnetic array , the unit is removed and equipped with all vacuum components .",
    "once the undulator is assembled in its final configuration , the phase error is remeasured and improved upon if necessary .",
    "we then characterize the magnetic array within the entire range of operation , producing models to operate it in the accelerator ( @xmath70 values and field errors as a function of gap height )  @xcite .    before removing the undulator from the measurement bench , we position two small permanent quadrupole magnets along the measured undulator magnetic axis , one immediately before and one after the u15 module , to be later used as a reference for the alignment in the accelerator beam line .",
    "these alignment quadrupoles are only used during the alignment procedure and are retracted from the beam by a remotely controlled pneumatic system during normal ( fel ) operation . taking the magnetic axis as reference has the advantage of reducing the requirements on the mechanical alignment accuracy .      to accommodate the u15 prototype in the sitf required substantial modification to the beam line in the diagnostics section . specifically , one of the 5  m girders in the fodo channel of the diagnostics section had to be removed and several accelerator components rearranged .",
    "the principal instrumentation needed for the planned undulator measurements consisted of two appropriately positioned bpms to monitor the effect of the undulator on the electron orbit and three yag : ce screens for the observation of the undulator radiation , located downstream of the undulator .",
    "the first of these yag : ce screens included a void area in the lower half to allow the vertically deflected electron beam to pass through without disturbing the photon signal registered in the upper screen area .",
    "the scintillating screens did not allow for measurements of the absolute intensity of the photon beam .",
    "additional information was gained from an in - air spectrometer capable of measuring the photon energy in the optical spectrum range .    throughout the undulator experiment ,",
    "the radiation dose was constantly monitored by means of dose rate monitors described in sec .",
    "[ sec : drm ] . during the three month period of the experiment an integral dose of about 100",
    "gy was recorded .",
    "the radiation had no observable effect either on the magnetic or on the electronic components of the undulator system , as was later confirmed with lab measurements following the removal of the undulator from the beam line .        with the one undulator installed , we define the reference orbit for its alignment simply by the centers of the nearest fixed quadrupoles upstream and downstream of the undulator and",
    "calibrate the adjacent bpms to this orbit .",
    "once the reference orbit has been identified , an alignment procedure is applied to ensure the coincidence of the undulator s magnetic axis with this orbit  @xcite . for the measurements in the horizontal plane ,",
    "the undulator gap is set to the nominal @xmath70 value , where field errors have been minimized by the magnetic optimization . for the measurements in the vertical plane , however , the undulator gap is kept open to avoid the strong focusing effects occurring at the relatively low energies available at the sitf .",
    "starting from the reference orbit with both alignment quadrupoles retracted , the upstream alignment quadrupole is placed into the beam , and the undulator is moved both horizontally and vertically . monitoring the downstream bpms , we then find the position of the undulator for which the reference orbit readings are recovered , i.e. , where the upstream alignment quadrupole has no steering effect . after removing the upstream alignment quadrupole , the downstream alignment quadrupole is inserted into the beam and the undulator is adjusted again both horizontally and vertically until the reference orbit is retrieved .",
    "once these two positionings have been determined , the final position and orientation ( pitch and yaw angle ) , for which the undulator is aligned with the reference orbit , can be computed and applied to the mover system .",
    "figure  [ fig : und_align ] shows an example of an undulator position scan performed as part of the alignment procedure .    , versus vertical undulator position . ]",
    "when working with a variable gap configuration the preservation of the undulator s field integrals ( governing the integral effect on the electron orbit ) for all gap settings is a demanding requirement .",
    "it is therefore important to characterize the undulator s net effect on the electron orbit as a function of the gap height to quantify possible residual field errors",
    ".    such residual field errors mainly occur at the entrance and the exit of the undulator , giving rise to corresponding deflections ( `` kicks '' ) in the electron orbit .",
    "if the electrons experience no focusing inside the undulator , these entrance and exit kicks can be inferred from the orbit modification at the undulator exit , both in position and angle ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , induced by the setting of the undulator gap to a certain @xmath70 value .",
    "while this change in orbit can not be measured directly , it can be derived from the orbit response further downstream . in our case",
    "we use two dedicated bpms downstream of the undulator .",
    "moreover , all magnets between the undulator and the two bpms are switched off .",
    "corrector magnets upstream of the undulator are used to ensure a constant injection orbit .",
    "the undulator gap is then reduced from the open position to the position corresponding to a certain @xmath70 value , and the associated change in the orbit downstream of the undulator is recorded by the bpms . the measurement is then repeated for different @xmath70 values .",
    "figure  [ fig : und_xkick ] shows the entrance and exit kicks in the horizontal plane as a function of the @xmath70 value , derived from downstream orbit measurements at a beam energy of 100  mev .",
    "the kicks , which are shown relative to the @xmath74 reference case ( not the nominal @xmath71 ) , exhibit the pattern expected from the central symmetry of the field profile , which is clearly not masked by field errors . at the highest @xmath70 values ( 1.8 ) the kicks amount to about 60  tm , close to predictions based on numerical calculations and magnetic measurements .",
    "value in the horizontal plane . ]",
    "the presence of natural focusing in the vertical plane prevents a straightforward interpretation of the orbit response at the undulator exit ( in this case @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) in terms of entrance and exit kicks .",

    "the resulting set of two - dimensional plots , reproduced in fig .",

    "the underlying colors correspond to the lengths of the arrows , i.e. , the deviations from zero orbit change , and illustrate the dependence of the natural focusing strength and center on the @xmath70 value .",
    "the plots for the different @xmath70 values are individually normalized to illustrate the focusing and bending effects . ]",
    "the overall relatively large orbit deflections in the vertical plane highlighted the need for improvements in the assembly and measurement of the magnetic array .",
    "consequently a new sorting algorithm based on the measurement of individual magnets has been planned and implemented for the next modules with the goal of increasing the quality of the field in the horizontal plane ( affecting the vertical electron orbit ) , thereby reducing the imperfections below specifications .",
    "moreover , the swissfel undulators will be equipped with additional vertical steering magnets to counteract any residual vertical orbit kicks .",
    "our first attempts to produce fel radiation from the undulator were made at a beam energy of 220  mev , corresponding to photon wavelengths between 61  nm ( for @xmath70 = 1 ) and 106  nm ( for @xmath70 = 1.8 ) .",
    "soon after setting up the beam transport through the undulator , a bright signal emerged on the first yag : ce screen downstream of the undulator , clearly related to fel radiation .",
    "but the asymmetric appearance of the beam spot in the form of a diffraction arc and the fact that it could not be propagated beyond the first screen strongly suggested that only a reflection of the actual fel signal was observed .",
    "later it became clear that the unexpectedly strong downward kick exerted by the fringe field at the undulator entrance prohibited the proper propagation of the photon beam in our initial beam - line configuration .",
    "after a modification of the beam line downstream of the undulator , increasing the effective aperture , a round beam spot could be observed on three screens located at distances between 1 and 4  m from the undulator exit  @xcite . due to the temporary failure of the klystron driving the last two s - band structures ,",
    "all subsequent measurements were performed at beam energies ranging between 100 and 130  mev , using , when needed , the x - band cavity to produce the energy chirp required for bunch compression . at a beam energy of 100  mev , a peak current of 20  a ( obtained without compression ) is sufficient to generate fel radiation with wavelength around 300  nm for @xmath70 = 1 , i.e. , in the optical ( ultraviolet ) range .",
    "in addition to this `` long - bunch '' mode , we also compressed the beam to reach a peak current of 200  a and characterized the fel radiation resulting from this `` short - bunch '' mode .",
    "we verified the sase nature of the observed radiation by confirming two of its salient characteristics , the beam divergence and the statistical distribution of the pulse intensities . to this end",
    "we compare the measured properties to simulation results , obtained with the genesis 1.3 code  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the photon beam spot size on the first three screens downstream of the undulator yields a photon beam divergence of 0.30  mrad , about an order of magnitude below the expected divergence for spontaneous radiation emanating from the undulator , but somewhat lower than the simulation value of 0.38  mrad , computed for the same beam conditions ( 130  mev beam energy , 200  a peak current ) .",
    "the difference between measurement and simulation is likely related to the uncertainty in the undulator s gain length , which can not be measured with only one module , and the associated variation of gain guiding effects .    a further distinctive property of sase radiation is the statistical distribution of the intensities of individual pulses , which is known to follow a single - parameter gamma distribution with free parameter @xmath77 corresponding to the number of contributing modes  @xcite .",
    "a histogram based on 5000 pulses measured in the long - bunch configuration is shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : sase ] , along with a fit to the gamma distribution , which yields a mode parameter @xmath78 . our simulation for this configuration results in @xmath79 , with the corresponding curve also indicated in the figure .",

    "[ fig : sase ] summarizes the analogous data for 1000 pulses obtained in the short - pulse configuration . in this case , the @xmath77 parameters fitted to the measurement and simulation data are 20 and 28 , respectively .",

    "parameter left free ( red ) and fixed to simulation results obtained for equivalent beam conditions . ]      the limitation in beam energy due to the outage of the last s - band booster rf station constrained the fel spectral range to the optical regime , for which an in - air spectrometer was already available at the sitf .",
    "the spectrometer ( ocean optics qe65000 ) , which had previously been used for studies of optical transition radiation at the same facility  @xcite , covers a spectral range between 220 and 950  nm wavelength .    at a beam energy of 120  mev , the variation of the undulator gap between 3.0 and 5.5  mm gives access to a spectral tuning range of the sase fel wavelength extending from about 200 to 360  nm . from the measured central wavelengths",

    "<S> the swissfel injector test facility operated at the paul scherrer institute between 2010 and 2014 , serving as a pilot plant and testbed for the development and realization of swissfel , the x - ray free - electron laser facility under construction at the same institute . </S>",
    "<S> the test facility consisted of a laser - driven rf electron gun followed by an s - band booster linac , a magnetic bunch compression chicane and a diagnostic section including a transverse deflecting rf cavity . </S>",
    "<S> it delivered electron bunches of up to 200  pc charge and up to 250  mev beam energy at a repetition rate of 10  hz . the measurements performed at the test facility not only demonstrated the beam parameters required to drive the first stage of an fel facility , but also led to significant advances in instrumentation technologies , beam characterization methods and the generation , transport and compression of ultra - low - emittance beams . </S>",
    "<S> we give a comprehensive overview of the commissioning experience of the principal subsystems and the beam physics measurements performed during the operation of the test facility , including the results of the test of an in - vacuum undulator prototype generating radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet and optical range . </S>"
