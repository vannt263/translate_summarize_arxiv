    "reduced dimensionality in degenerate ultracold atomic gases plays a key role for the experimental realization and theoretical investigation of exotic quantum phases such as the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite .",
    "specifically , atomic collisions in waveguides represent a fundamental ingredient for studying the effects of the reduced dimensionality .",
    "indeed , in two - body collisions , the confinement implies significant modifications of the scattering properties of the collisional complex . existing theoretical studies on bosonic collisions",
    "show that resonant scattering can be induced by the confinement , yielding the so - called confinement - induced resonance ( cir ) effect @xcite .",
    "a cir emerges when the length scale of the confinement becomes comparable to the @xmath2-wave scattering length of the colliding bosons and it is interpreted as a fano - feshbach - like resonance .",
    "an important characteristic property is that the effective one - dimensional two - body interaction can be controlled by adjusting the confinement parameters .    in recent years , the significant progress of quantum technologies has lead to the experimental observation and exploration of the cir physics in quasi - one- and quasi - two - dimensional waveguides for both , bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite",
    ". additionally , remarkable theoretical studies focus on cir physics and its extensions such as @xmath3-wave cir in spin - polarized fermions @xcite , dual - cir @xcite , and the resonant molecule formation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the concept of cir physics has been investigated also in the case of quasi - two - dimensional or anharmonic waveguides @xcite and in the case of multichannel or mixed - dimension scattering @xcite .",
    "higher - partial wave interactions constitute an interesting extension within the framework of cir physics as it was shown in @xcite , since they are expected to provide novel many - body phenomena , such as unconventional superconductivity or superfluidity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a thorough theoretical treatment is still needed extending the cir physics beyond @xmath2- or @xmath3-wave interactions .    in this work",
    ", we present a theoretical framework for atom - atom collisions in the presence of a harmonic waveguide , where all the higher partial waves are properly taken into account either for bosons or fermions .",
    "mainly , it consists of a generalization of the @xmath1-matrix approach for quasi - one - dimensional geometries presented in @xcite .",
    "our treatment yields mutually coupled @xmath0-wave confinement - induced resonances as well as an analytical relation for the position of all @xmath0-wave cirs .",
    "furthermore , converting the `` physical '' quasi-1d @xmath1-matrix into a dyson - like form of equations allows us to classify , in terms of specific transition diagrams , all possible processes which the two atoms undergo during the collision .",
    "this detailed analysis permits us to illustrate the connection of the transitions in the manifold of the closed channels of the transverse confinement with the fano - feshbach scenario for resonant scattering .",
    "the validity of our method is verified showing an excellent agreement of the obtained analytical results with numerical calculations of the transmission coefficient in a system of two bosons interacting via a lennard - jones potential in the presence of harmonic confinement .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the general aspects of @xmath1-matrix theory , and present the @xmath1-matrix approach for quasi - one dimensional systems . sec .",
    "iii contains a comparison of the analytical results with the numerical calculations and a corresponding discussion .",
    "iv provides a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "the @xmath1-matrix is defined as a caley transformation of the @xmath4-matrix given by the following relation :    @xmath5    the form of eq.([1 ] ) is such that the hermiticity of the matrix @xmath1 ensures the unitarity of @xmath4 .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath1-matrix with respect to the @xmath4-matrix is that it possesses a simpler pole structure .",
    "this allows for an analysis of overlapping resonances in a straightforward manner .",
    "let us now consider collisions of two atoms in the presence of an external potential , which confines the transversal degrees of freedoms .",
    "the transversal confinement is induced by a harmonic potential , which permits a separation of center of mass and relative degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the two - body scattering problem can be reduced to a problem of a single particle ( relative particle ) scattered by a potential ( interatomic potential ) placed at the origin .",
    "the hamiltonian of the relative particle , expressed in cylindrical coordinates , reads : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the reduced mass of the two colliding atoms , @xmath8 is the transversal confinement frequency and @xmath9 is a short - range interatomic potential .",
    "we assume that the interatomic and the transversal confinement potential do not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the corresponding quantum number @xmath11 is conserved and throughout this paper we will focus on @xmath12 .",
    "the relative hamiltonian imposes two approximate symmetries in different regions of the configuration space .",
    "near to the origin , @xmath13 , the interatomic potential @xmath9 of range @xmath14 dominates and therefore the collision process obeys spherical symmetry . thus in this regime , for @xmath15 , the relative particle experiences a free - space collision off the interatomic potential with the total colliding energy @xmath16 .",
    "this process can be described by the following radial wavefunction : @xmath17 where @xmath18 labels the linearly independent solutions , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the regular ( irregular ) solution , i.e. spherical bessel @xmath21 ( spherical von neumann @xmath22 ) functions multiplied by the legendre polynomials @xmath23 , and the summation runs over all the even ( odd ) @xmath0 for the case of bosons ( fermions ) .",
    "@xmath24 are the elements of the @xmath1-matrix @xmath25 in three - dimensions encapsulating all the scattering information related to the interatomic potential @xmath9 . due to the short - range character of the interatomic interactions @xmath25 is diagonal and its elements are equal to @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the phase shift of the @xmath0-th partial wave .",
    "additionally , in the asymptotic limit , @xmath28 , the transversal confinement term in eq.([2 ] ) dominates implying its cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the total colliding energy @xmath29 can be written as a sum of the transversal energy being determined by the harmonic confinement and the longitudinal energy , which involves to the @xmath30-component of the momentum of the relative particle , according to the relation @xmath31 . in this region",
    "the wavefunctions are axially symmetric and can be written as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 labels the linearly independent solutions , @xmath34 are the elements of the @xmath1-matrix @xmath35 in quasi - one dimension and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the regular ( irregular ) solution in the presence of the trap with no interactions .",
    "the specific form of the regular and irregular solutions are as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the eigenfunctions of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator for @xmath12 and the functions in the curly bracket refer to the longitudinal degree of freedom including the symmetrization ( antisymmetrization ) for the case of bosons ( fermions ) .",
    "so far it is clear that the scattering process of atomic collisions in the presence of a harmonic waveguide is characterized by two distinct regions in the configuration space which possess different symmetries .",
    "thus , the key idea is to perform a frame transformation which will permit the matching of eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) yielding an expression of @xmath35 in terms of @xmath25 .",
    "obviously , a unitary frame transformation in this case does nt exist since eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) do not fulfill the same schrdinger equation in complete configuration space .",
    "however , the length scales of the interatomic potential @xmath14 and the harmonic oscillator @xmath40 differ by orders of magnitudes , @xmath41 .",
    "this means that between the two distinct regions of spherical and cylindrical symmetry there is a region where @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , for this configuration subspace eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) fulfill approximately the same schrdinger equation , and one can perform a local and non - orthogonal frame transformation .",
    "the idea of local frame transformations was introduced by harmin and fano @xcite and extended later on by greene @xcite .    as it was shown in @xcite the above - mentioned local frame transformation",
    "does not depend on any additional parameter in order to match the two sets of solutions , eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the only condition which has to be fulfilled is @xmath41 ( separation of scales ) yielding the following relations , which connect eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the matrix element of the local frame transformation @xmath45 given by the relation : @xmath46 in eq.([7 ] ) @xmath47 is the @xmath0-th legendre polynomial and the term @xmath48 is @xmath49 or @xmath50 for the case of bosons or fermions , respectively .",
    "note that the local transformation @xmath45 connects the @xmath0 partial waves with the @xmath51-modes of the transversal confining potential .",
    "thus @xmath35 with the help of eqs . (",
    "[ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) will take following form : @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) the matrix @xmath35 involves an admixture of all @xmath51 channels of the transversal confinement with all @xmath0 partial waves of the interatomic potential for all energies .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , for collisions which involve a single partial wave , the matrix elements of the @xmath76 are given by the simple relation @xmath77 , where after the diagonalization and the inversion of @xmath78 one can obtain @xmath79 in closed form .",
    "however , one should note that @xmath80 in this case is a rank one matrix .",
    "interestingly , one can rewrite @xmath81 in a much simpler form by exploiting this property with the help of @xcite .",
    "then @xmath79 reads    @xmath82    where @xmath83 .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) provides us with all the transitions which the two atoms undergo during the collision .",
    "[ schem ] illustrates eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) as a transition diagram , where the transitions are not direct , but through the @xmath0-th partial wave , which participates as an intermediate process .",
    "thus , the first term , both in fig .",
    "[ schem ] and in eq.([11 ] ) indicates a direct `` open - open '' ( oo ) channel transition and contains , in particular , the description of potential resonances . the second term of eq.([11 ] )",
    "is related with transitions into closed channels , which can be split into two processes . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ schem ] the second term of eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) consists of two transition processes , the first describes an `` open - closed - open '' ( oco ) channel transition , while the second describes an `` open - closed '' ( oc ) channel transition , followed by transitions from _ all _ closed channels to _ all _ closed channels ( cc ) and finally a `` closed - open '' ( co ) channel transition .",
    "note that a similar idea has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "channels which contribute in the scattering process , corresponding to the @xmath1-matrix @xmath84 .",
    "the empty ( filled ) circles indicate the open ( closed ) channels , the arrows depict the transitions through the @xmath0-th partial wave , and the dots denote the @xmath85 channels and their corresponding transitions . ]",
    "the contribution of the transitions into the closed channels during the two - body collision is significantly affected by the factor @xmath86 , where the parameter @xmath87 includes all the closed channel transitions through an effective bound state which is supported by all the closed channels and for @xmath88 the bound state coincides with the threshold yielding a resonant collision process . indeed , according to mqdt",
    "this can be justified since the parameter @xmath89 is a root of the relation @xmath90 and as we have mentioned above these roots describe the closed channel bound states at given energy @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we observe that the @xmath1-matrix approach provides us with an important insight of cir physics by linking in a transparent way the physical picture of virtual excitations @xcite and the fano - feshbach - like scheme @xcite . additionally , an important aspect of the transition diagram ( see fig . [ schem ] ) is that it illustrates in a clear manner the fano - feshbach mechanism : the first term represents the continuum ( either interacting or non - interacting ) and the second term exhibits all the cc transitions , which collectively result to an effective closed channel bound state and its coupling to the continuum . by applying @xmath91 for each single @xmath0 partial wave one obtains the condition for resonant scattering of bosons or spin - polarized fermions under strong transverse confinement .",
    "thus for @xmath92 one will obtain the same resonance condition as in @xcite , being in agreement with pseudopotential theory .",
    "up to now we have been focusing on the case of a single partial wave . by extending the @xmath1-matrix @xmath25 into an @xmath93 diagonal matrix ,",
    "we take into account all the partial waves compatible with the atomic species , i.e. even ( odd ) @xmath0 for bosononic ( fermionic ) collisions . consequently , by finding the roots of @xmath94 of the extended @xmath1-matrix , we obtain an expression which provides us with the positions of all the @xmath0-wave confinement - induced resonances coupled to each other .",

    "a similar behavior is expected also for the case of spin - polarized fermionic collisions involving @xmath3- and @xmath101-partial waves and their couplings .",
    "nevertheless , we should mention that for higher partial waves ( @xmath169 ) the widths of the corresponding @xmath0-wave cirs become very narrow , due to the pronounced centrifugal barrier which the atoms have to tunnel through in order to perform a @xmath0-partial wave collision .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that within the framework of the @xmath1-matrix approach the origin of the narrow @xmath0-wave resonances in the presence of confinement is a fano - feshbach - like .",
    "the latter is not in conflict with the interpretation given in @xcite , due to the fact that when an @xmath167 fano - feshbach resonance is slightly above the threshold , it can be seen also as a shape resonance @xcite .",
    "this situation occurs also in the considered system because the energy of the maximum of the centrifugal barrier is three orders of magnitude larger than the energy of the ground state of the harmonic confinement , thus the atoms in the @xmath100-wave fano - feshbach - like state tunnel through the barrier exactly as if they would be in a single - channel shape resonant state .",
    "this complex behavior can be described in a transparent way within the @xmath1-matrix approach .",
