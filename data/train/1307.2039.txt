    "throughout , @xmath0 is a polish space and @xmath13 a sequence of @xmath0-valued random variables on the probability space @xmath14 .",
    "we let @xmath15 denote the borel @xmath7-field on @xmath0 and @xmath16 the set of probability measures on @xmath15 .",
    "a  random probability measure on @xmath0 is a map @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath7-field on @xmath20 generated by @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .    for each @xmath9 ,",
    "let @xmath23 be the @xmath24th _ predictive measure_. thus , @xmath23 is a random probability measure on @xmath0 , and @xmath25 is a version of @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "define also @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 is _ exchangeable _ , as assumed in this section , there is a random probability measure @xmath3 on @xmath0 such that @xmath30 such an @xmath3 can also be viewed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the empirical measure .",
    "further , @xmath3 grants the usual representation @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a @xmath7-finite measure on @xmath15 .",
    "our _ first problem _ is to give conditions for @xmath35 the conditions should concern the finite dimensional distributions @xmath36 , @xmath9 , only .",
    "while investigating ( [ goal ] ) , one meets another problem , of possible independent interest .",
    "let @xmath11 denote total variation norm on @xmath37 .",
    "our _ second problem _ is to give conditions for @xmath38",
    "again , let @xmath39 be exchangeable .    reasonable conditions for ( [ goal ] ) look of theoretical interest .",
    "they are of practical interest as well thanks to bayesian nonparametrics . in this framework ,",
    "the starting point is a prior @xmath40 on @xmath16 . since @xmath41 , condition ( [ goal ] )",
    "is equivalent to @xmath42 this is a basic information for the subsequent statistical analysis . roughly speaking ,",
    "it means that the `` underlying statistical model '' consists of absolutely continuous laws .",
    "notwithstanding the significance of ( [ goal ] ) , however , there is a growing literature which gets around the first problem of this paper . indeed , in a plenty of bayesian nonparametric problems , condition ( [ goal ] ) is just a crude _ assumption _ and",
    "the prior  @xmath40 is directly assessed on a set of densities ( with respect to @xmath6 ) .",
    "see , for example , @xcite  and references therein .",
    "instead , it seems reasonable to get ( [ goal ] ) as a consequence of explicit assumptions on the finite dimensional distributions @xmath43 , . from a foundational point of view , in fact , only assumptions on observable facts make sense . this attitude is strongly supported by de finetti , among others .",
    "when dealing with the sequence @xmath29 , the observable facts are events of the type @xmath44 for some @xmath9 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is why , in this paper , the conditions for ( [ goal ] ) are requested to concern @xmath43 , @xmath9 , only .",
    "some references related to the above remarks are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite and @xcite , diaconis and freedman have an exchangeable sequence of indicators and give conditions for the mixing measure ( i.e. , the prior @xmath40 ) to be absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "the present paper is much in the spirit of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that we give conditions for the mixands @xmath46 , and not for the mixing measure  @xmath40 , to be absolutely continuous .",
    "next , a necessary condition for ( [ goal ] ) is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "condition ( [ nec ] ) clearly involves the finite dimensional distributions only .",
    "thus , a ( natural ) question is whether ( [ nec ] ) suffices for ( [ goal ] ) as well .",
    "the answer is yes provided @xmath3 can be approximated by the predictive measures @xmath23 in some stronger sense .",
    "in fact , condition ( [ nec ] ) can be written as @xmath49 hence , if ( [ nec ] ) holds and @xmath50 , the set @xmath51 has probability 1 . and , for each @xmath52 , one obtains @xmath53    therefore , ( [ goal ] ) follows from ( [ nec ] ) and @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , a martingale argument implies the converse implication , that is , @xmath55 see theorem [ p09nh5 t ] .",
    "thus , our first problem turns into the second one .    the question of whether @xmath56 is of independent interest . among other things",
    ", it is connected to bayesian consistency .",
    "surprisingly , however , this question seems not answered so far .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , @xmath54 in every example known so far . and",
    "in fact , for some time , we conjectured that @xmath54 under condition ( [ nec ] ) . but",
    "this is not true .",
    "as shown in example  [ mainexamp ] , when @xmath57 and @xmath58 lebesgue measure , it may be that @xmath59 for all @xmath24 , and yet @xmath3 is singular continuous a.s . indeed , the ( topological ) support of @xmath60 has hausdorff dimension 0 for almost all @xmath61 .    thus , ( [ nec ] ) does not suffice for ( [ goal ] ) . to get ( [ goal ] ) , in addition to ( [ nec ] ) , one needs some growth conditions on the conditional densities .",
    "we refer to forthcoming theorem  [ rfg76yu8 ] for such conditions . here , we mention a result on the second problem . actually , for @xmath50 , it suffices that @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the continuous part of @xmath64 ; see theorem [ gt67fc4 ] .    finally , most results mentioned above do not need exchangeability of @xmath29 , but the weaker assumption @xmath65 those sequences @xmath29 satisfying the above condition , investigated in @xcite , are called _ conditionally identically distributed _ ( c.i.d . ) .",
    "in this section , @xmath66 , @xmath67 for @xmath9 and @xmath68 . if @xmath69 is a random probability measure on @xmath0 , we write @xmath70 to denote the real random variable @xmath71 , @xmath27 . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath72 is a borel function , integrable with respect to @xmath73 for almost all @xmath61 , we write @xmath74 to denote @xmath75 .",
