    "however , the slope of the linear fitting is less pronounced due to the `` soft '' nature of the pt - pt bonds within the cluster , which can stretch their cluster m - m bonds to accommodate the incoming o@xmath0 molecule effecting the overall gcn and @xmath31 values .",
    "ni clusters on the other hand , interact their strongly with o@xmath0 that for gcn values between 5 and 6 ( @xmath53 ) - leaving a narrow window from 6 to 8 for a slightly weaker adsorption - again at gcn above 8 , the o@xmath0 molecule is strongly adsorbed and in some cases fastly dissociated thus affecting the overall linear trend .",
    "interestingly , we have reported similar trends where o@xmath0 adsorption can take place at low @xmath31 ( @xmath41 0.5 ev ) for gcn values above 8 , for the particular case of larger to and co clusters involving 82 and 86 atoms , respectively@xcite .",
    "using a wide variety of pt - ni , pt and ni geometries , sizes and compositions supported over mgo(100 ) our results we shown that molecular have shown that o@xmath0 adsorption on the sub - nanometer range ( from 25 up to 58 atoms ) is a rather complex case . their corresponding electronic structure as analysed via the calculated position of _ d_-band center as well as the local geometry at the adsorption site using the generalised coordination number ( gcn ) .",
    "the calculation of these two quantities show that these two effects are deeply intertwined , directly affecting the calculated e@xmath6 values .",
    "o@xmath0 adsorption is regulated by mainly 2 types of inequivalent sites : ( a ) strongest e@xmath6 values ( above 1 ev ) are calculated at cluster edges , such as the _ along edge_(111)/(111 ) and ( 111)/(100 ) as well as the _ between edge_(111)/(100 ) sites which tend to have a low gcn value ( @xmath96 ) ; and ( b ) the fcc and hcp sites where the _ weakest _ e@xmath6 values ( less than 0.64 ev ) are calculated , involving gcn values @xmath10 8 which resemble those o@xmath0 adsorption energies of the flat pt(111 ) surface . in general , calculated _",
    "d_-band centers positions for those pt atoms at the adsorption are located at lower energies from the fermi level ( e@xmath54 ) , thus indicating a stronger binding between the metal and the o@xmath0 adsorbate .",
    "the opposite is seen for the weakest adsorption sites , where _ d_-band centers positions are closer to the e@xmath54 ; though this trend can be affected if the o@xmath0 is found to be dissociated as pt interactions with atomic o are stronger compared to the molecular case .    from our calculations",
    "provide - as far as we are concerned - the first o@xmath0 chemisorption map for across a wide range of supported pt - ni clusters .",
    "clear o@xmath0 adsorption trends provide a deeper understanding on potential adsorption sites for low - barrier o@xmath0 dissociation , following sabatier principle",
    ". this will imply that the best catalysts should be the ones that bind both atoms and molecules not too weakly nor too strongly , in order to activate the reactants and to efficiently desorb the products@xcite .",
    "we show from our results that it is theoretically possible to construct core - shell systems , where the core of the nanoparticle ( cluster ) is made of a cheaper metal ( ni ) compared to a more expensive metal on the shell ( pt ) .",
    "this not only reduces the amount of pt - loading by alloying ; but preserves the pt chemistry at a mere 1 atomic - layer pt - shell where o@xmath0 adsorption process can occur with calculated e@xmath6 values of the order of those seen for a full monometallic pt nanoparticle and bulk pt(111 ) surface .",
    "having systematically analysed the effects of o@xmath0 adsorption over supported over mono ( pt , ni ) and bimetallic ( pt - ni ) clusters ( @xmath551 nm . ) , we foresee that a potential tailoring of chemisorption properties and the rational design of novel nanocatalysts will ultimately depend a synergistic combination of controlled nps preparation methods ( size , geometric and segregation effects ) and on a profound knowledge of the complex electronic properties of both nps and oxide support .",

    "<S> the largest adsorption energy values are found to be along the edges between two neighbouring ( 111)/(111 ) and ( 111)/(100 ) facets ; while fcc and hcp sites located on the ( 111 ) facets may show a chemisorption value lower 0.3 ev where often fast o@xmath0 dissociation easily occurs . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , even though it is difficult to disentangle the geometrical and electronic effects on the oxygen molecule adsorption , there is a strong correlation between the calculated general coordination number ( gcn ) and the chemisorption map . finally , the inclusion of dispersion corrections ( dft - d ) leads to an overall increase on the calculated adsorption energy values but with a negligible alteration on the general o@xmath0 adsorption trends . </S>"
