    "in this chapter we consider plane couette flow  the flow between two infinite parallel plates moving in opposite directions .",
    "this flow is characterized by a single non - dimensional parameter , the reynolds number , defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the gap between the plates , @xmath2 is the speed of the plates and @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "see figure  [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "for all values of @xmath4 , laminar couette flow @xmath5 is a solution of the incompressible navier - stokes equations satisfying no - slip boundary conditions at the moving plates .",
    "this solution is linearly stable at all values of @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless it is not unique . in particular , for @xmath4 greater than approximately @xmath6 @xcite , turbulent states are found in experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "our interest is in the flow states found as one decreases @xmath4 from developed turbulent flows to the lowest limit for which turbulence exists .",
    "our work is motivated by the experimental studies of prigent and coworkers ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) on flow in a very large aspect - ratio plane couette apparatus .",
    "near the minimum @xmath4 for which turbulence is sustained , they find remarkable , essentially steady , spatially - periodic patterns of turbulent and laminar flow .",
    "these patterns emerge spontaneously from featureless turbulence as the reynolds number is decreased .",
    "figure  [ fig : visualization ] shows such a pattern from numerical computations presented in this chapter .",
    "two very striking features of these patterns are their large wavelength , compared with the gap between the plates , and the fact that the patterns form at an angle to the streamwise direction .",
    "fluid flows exhibiting coexisting turbulent and laminar regions have a significant history in fluid dynamics . in the mid 1960s a state known as spiral turbulence",
    "was first discovered @xcite in counter - rotating taylor  couette flow .",
    "this state consists of a turbulent and a laminar region , each with a spiral shape .",
    "the experiments of prigent et al .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) in a very large aspect - ratio taylor ",
    "couette system showed that in fact the turbulent and laminar regions form a periodic pattern , of which the original observations of coles and van atta comprised only one wavelength .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) discovered large - scale turbulent spirals as well , in the shear flow between a stationary and a rotating disk . when converted to comparable quantities , the reynolds - number thresholds , wavelengths , and angles",
    "are very similar for all of these turbulent patterned flows .",
    "our computational technique @xcite extends the minimal flow unit methodology pioneered by jimnez and moin  ( @xcite ) and by @xcite ( @xcite ) and so we begin by recalling this approach .",
    "turbulence near transition in plane couette and other channel flows is characterized by the cyclical generation and breakdown of streaks by streamwise - oriented vortices .",
    "the natural streak spacing in the spanwise direction is about 45@xmath7 . in the minimal flow unit approach",
    ", the smallest laterally periodic domain is sought that can sustain this basic turbulent cycle . for plane couette flow at @xmath8",
    ", @xcite ( @xcite ) determined this to be approximately @xmath9 .",
    "this domain is called the minimal flow unit ( mfu ) .",
    "the fundamental role of the streaks and streamwise vortices is manifested by the fact that the spanwise length of the mfu is near the natural spanwise streak spacing .",
    "figure  [ fig : domains](a ) shows the mfu in streamwise - spanwise coordinates .",
    "we extend the mfu computations in two ways .",
    "first we tilt the simulation domain in the lateral plane at angle @xmath10 to the streamwise direction [ figure  [ fig : domains](b ) ] .",
    "we use @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the tilted coordinates .",
    "we impose periodic lateral boundary conditions on the tilted domain . to respect the spanwise streak spacing while imposing periodic boundary conditions in @xmath11 , the domain satisfies @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "( for @xmath15 , we require @xmath16 . ) secondly , we greatly extend one of the dimensions , @xmath17 , past the mfu requirement [ figure  [ fig : domains](c ) ] , in practice between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , usually @xmath20 .",
    "this approach presents two important advantages , one numerical and the other physical .",
    "first , it greatly reduces the computational expense of simulating large length - scale turbulent - laminar flows .",
    "our tilted domains need only be long perpendicular to the turbulent bands . in the direction in which the pattern is homogeneous ,",
    "the domains are of minimal size , just large enough to capture the streamwise vortices typical of shear turbulence .",
    "second , the approach allows us to impose or restrict the pattern orientation and wavelength .",
    "we can thereby investigate these features and establish minimal conditions necessary to produce these large - scale patterns .",
    "we now present some further details of our simulations .",
    "we consider the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations written in the primed coordinate systems .",
    "after nondimensionalizing by the plate speed @xmath2 and the half gap @xmath7 , these equations become    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the velocity field and @xmath23 is the static pressure in the primed coordinate system , and @xmath24 is used to indicate that derivatives are taken with respect to primed coordinates .",
    "@xmath25 is the computational domain . in these coordinates ,",
    "the no - slip and periodic boundary conditions are    @xmath26    the equations are simulated using the spectral - element ( @xmath11-@xmath27 )  fourier ( @xmath12 ) code prism @xcite .",
    "we use a spatial resolution consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "specifically , for a domain with dimensions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we use a computational grid with close to @xmath28 elements in the @xmath11 direction and 5 elements in the @xmath27 direction . within each element",
    ", we usually use @xmath30th order polynomial expansions for the primitive variables .",
    "figure [ fig : domain_3d ] shows a spectral element mesh used for the case of @xmath31 . in the @xmath12 direction , a fourier representation is used and the code is parallelized over the fourier modes .",
    "our typical domain has @xmath32 , which we discretize with 1024 fourier modes or gridpoints .",
    "thus the total spatial resolution we use for the @xmath33 domain can be expressed as @xmath34 .",
    "we shall always use @xmath35 for the original streamwise , cross - channel , spanwise coordinates ( figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "we obtain usual streamwise , and spanwise components of velocity and vorticity using @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and similarly for vorticity .",
    "the kinetic energy reported is the difference between the velocity @xmath38 and simple couette flow @xmath39 , i.e.  @xmath40 .",
    "we have verified the accuracy of our simulations in small domains by comparing to prior simulations @xcite . in large domains",
    "we have examined mean velocities , reynolds stresses , and correlations in a turbulent - laminar flow at @xmath41 and find that these reproduce experimental results from taylor  couette @xcite and plane couette @xcite flow .",
    "while neither experimental study corresponds exactly to our case , the agreement supports our claim that our simulations correctly capture turbulent - laminar states .",
    "the procedure we use to initiate turbulence is inspired by previous investigations of plane couette flow in a perturbed geometry .",
    "we recall that laminar plane couette flow is linearly stable at all reynolds numbers .",
    "it has been found , experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite , that the presence of a wire @xcite or a ribbon @xcite oriented along the spanwise direction causes the flow in the resulting geometry to become linearly unstable to either a steady or a turbulent state containing streamwise vortices .",
    "we simulate such a flow with a ribbon which is infinitesimal in the @xmath11 direction , occupies 30% of the cross - channel direction @xmath27 and spans the entire @xmath12 direction .",
    "at @xmath42 , the effect of such a ribbon is to produce a turbulent flow quickly without the need to try different initial conditions .",
    "once the turbulent flow produced by the ribbon is simulated for a few hundred time units , the ribbon can be removed and the turbulence remains .",
    "this procedure is used to initialize turbulent states for the simulations to be described below .",
    "we begin with one of our first simulations , in a domain tilted at angle @xmath43 .",
    "this angle has been chosen to be close to that observed experimentally near pattern onset .",
    "the simulation shows the spontaneous formation of a turbulent - laminar pattern as the reynolds number is decreased .",
    "we initiated a turbulent flow at @xmath42 by perturbing laminar couette flow with a ribbon as described in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "time zero in figure  [ fig : first_spacetime ] corresponds to the removal of the ribbon .",
    "the flow is simulated for 500 time units at @xmath42 and the kinetic energy @xmath44 is measured at 32 points equally spaced in @xmath12 along the line @xmath45 in the mid - channel shown in figure  [ fig : domain_3d ] .",
    "the corresponding 32 time series are plotted at the corresponding values of @xmath12 . at @xmath42 , there is no persistent large - scale variation in the flow , a state which we describe as uniform turbulence .",
    "( this is not the homogeneous or fully developed turbulence that exists at higher reynolds numbers or in domains without boundaries . ) at the end of 500 time units , @xmath4 is abruptly changed to @xmath46 and the simulation continued for another 500 time units . then @xmath4 is abruptly lowered to @xmath47 and the simulation is continued for 1000 time units , etc .",
    "as labeled on the right in figure  [ fig : first_spacetime ] .    at @xmath41 we clearly see the spontaneous formation of a pattern",
    ". out of uniform turbulence emerge three regions of relatively laminar flow between three regions of turbulent flow .",
    "( we will later discuss the degree to which the flow is laminar . ) while the individual time traces are irregular , the pattern is itself steady and has a clear wavelength of 40 in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "this reynolds number and wavelength are very close to what is seen in the experiments .",
    "figure  [ fig : three_boxes ] shows visualizations of the flow at the final time in figure  [ fig : first_spacetime ] . shown",
    "are the kinetic energy , streamwise velocity , and streamwise vorticity in the midplane between the plates .",
    "the computational domain is repeated periodically to tile an extended region of the midplane .",
    "the angle of the pattern is dictated by the imposed tilt of the computational domain .",
    "the wavelength of the pattern is not imposed by the computations other than that it must be commensurate with @xmath48 .",
    "the vorticity isosurfaces of this flow field were shown in figure  [ fig : visualization ] .",
    "spanwise and cross - channel velocity components show similar banded patterns .",
    "clearly visible in the center figure are streamwise streaks typical of shear flows .",
    "these streaks have a spanwise spacing on the scale of the plate separation but have quite long streamwise extent .",
    "we stress how these long streaks are realized in our computations .",
    "a streak seen in figure  [ fig : three_boxes ] typically passes through several repetitions of the computational domain , as a consequence of the imposed periodic boundary conditions . in the single tilted rectangular computational domain , a single long streak",
    "is actually computed as several adjacent streaks connected via periodic boundary conditions .",
    "figure  [ fig : four_cuts ] shows the streamwise vorticity and velocity fields between the plates .",
    "the two leftmost images correspond to the same field as in figure  [ fig : three_boxes ] .",
    "the streamwise vorticity is well localized in the turbulent regions .",
    "mushrooms of high- and low - speed fluid , corresponding to streamwise streaks , can be seen in the turbulent regions of flow .",
    "dark velocity contours , corresponding to fluid velocity approximately equal to that of the lower and upper moving plates , are seen to reach into the center of the channel in the turbulent regions . in the center of the laminar regions , where the flow is relatively quiescent ( figure  [ fig : first_spacetime ] ) , there is very little streamwise vorticity and the streamwise velocity profile is not far from that of laminar couette flow . in particular ,",
    "no high- or low - speed fluid reaches into the center of the channel in these laminar regions .    in figure  [ fig : mean_fluc ]",
    "we show the mean and rms of the streamwise and spanwise velocity components obtained from averages over @xmath49 time units .",
    "these results show that the mean flow is maximal at the boundaries separating the turbulent and laminar regions while the fluctuations are maximal in the middle of the turbulent bands .",
    "this agrees with the experimental observations of of prigent et al .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) note further that the regions of high fluctuation have approximately the same rhombic shape as the turbulent regions shown by @xcite ( @xcite ) in experiments on taylor  couette flow .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : constant_x_spacetime ] shows a space - time plot of streamwise velocity along the spanwise line @xmath50 .",
    "specifically , data is taken from reconstructed flows as in figure  [ fig : three_boxes ] .",
    "time zero in figure  [ fig : constant_x_spacetime ] corresponds to the field in figure  [ fig : three_boxes ] .",
    "time is taken downward in this figure to allow for comparison with a similar figure from the experimental study by hegseth ( @xcite : figure  6 ) showing the propagation of streaks away from the center of turbulent regions .",
    "our results agree quantitatively with those of hegseth .",
    "we find propagation of streaks away from the center of the turbulent regions with an average spanwise propagation speed of approximately 0.054 in units of the plate speed @xmath2 .",
    "translating from the diffusive time units used by hegseth , we estimate the average spanwise propagation speed of streaks in his data to be approximately 0.060 at reynolds number @xmath51 .",
    "this space - time plot again shows the extent to which there is some small activity in the regions we refer to as laminar .      , which is an average over time @xmath52 of the modulus of the fourier transform in the @xmath12 direction of 32 spanwise velocity samples taken along the line @xmath53 .",
    "the components with wavenumber @xmath54 ( solid curve ) , @xmath55 ( long - dashed curve ) , @xmath56 ( short - dashed curve ) and @xmath57 ( dotted curve ) can be used as a quantitative diagnostic of a turbulent - laminar pattern .",
    "for example , the dominance of the @xmath54 component indicates a pattern containing three turbulent bands . from left to right , the average is taken over @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    ", width=453 ]    we have determined a good quantitative diagnostic of the spatial periodicity of a turbulent - laminar pattern .",

    "we take a fourier transform in @xmath12 of the spanwise velocity @xmath65 , yielding @xmath66 .",

    "these features are reflected in the average spectral coefficients .",
    "the flow evolves from uniform turbulence ( all components of about the same amplitude ) to intermittent turbulence , to a pattern containing three turbulent bands ( dominant @xmath54 component ) and then two turbulent bands ( dominant @xmath55 component ) , then a single band ( dominant @xmath56 and @xmath55 components ) , and finally becomes laminar ( all components disappear ) .    in the simulation on the right",

    "a single turbulent band is seen when @xmath82 .",
    "this band divides into two when @xmath84 and a third band appears when @xmath85 : the periodic pattern adjusts to keep the wavelength in the range 3565 .",

    ", which is 4660 .",
    "when the same protocol is followed at @xmath79 , no additional turbulent bands appear as @xmath17 is increased .",
    "we call the state at @xmath79 localized and note that turbulent spots are reported near these values of @xmath4 in the experiments . the small @xmath28 of our computational domain does not permit localization in the @xmath11 direction ; instead localized states must necessarily take the form of bands when visualized in the @xmath86-@xmath87 plane .    the instantaneous integrated kinetic energy profile @xmath88",
    "is plotted at the final time for both cases . for @xmath41 , @xmath89",

    "the threshold for intermittency is also difficult to define and to determine .",
    "the most striking difference between our computations and the experimental data is that the range of angles over which we find periodic turbulent - laminar patterns ( from @xmath96 to at least @xmath98 ) is far greater than that seen in the experiment .",
    "patterns with angles outside of the experimental range are likely to be unstable in a large domain in which the angle is unconstrained .",
    "our computational technique requires that the size of the domain be increased as @xmath10 decreases according to @xmath110 in order to respect the spanwise vortex or streak spacing ; see figure  [ fig : domains ] .",

    "@xcite ( @xcite ) studied the effect of quenching rate on turbulent lifetimes . for rates of reynolds number decrease comparable to ours",
    ", they found that turbulence could in some cases subsist to @xmath109 or 290 for times on the order of @xmath62 to 10000 ; for quenching rates ten times faster than ours , turbulence was occasionally sustained to @xmath142 .",
    "if we compare our results to the previous simulations , then the conclusion would be that turbulence is favored by a short streamwise direction @xmath143 and a long spanwise direction @xmath144 .",
    "when either of these two conditions are lifted , the turbulence disappears .",

    "it is , however , possible that some parameter combinations may support different numbers of turbulent bands ( although we have not yet observed this ) .",
    "all states are bistable with respect to laminar couette flow and if parameters are changed too abruptly , then reversion to laminar couette flow occurs .",
    "it appears that large - scale patterns are inevitable intermediate states on the route from turbulent to laminar flow in large aspect - ratio couette flow .",
