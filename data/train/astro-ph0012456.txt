    "the canonical methods used to find the coefficients of the fp ( or of correlations between two variables ) are of the least - squares type : one minimizes the orthogonal ( absolute or squared ) residuals from the plane ( jrgensen et al . 1996 , jrgensen 1997 , pahre et al .",

    "however , none of these approaches is able to deal effectively with the multiple problems that the efar and similar datasets pose : ( i ) the factor two in redshift spanned , ( ii ) the strong selection effects , ( iii ) the non - negligible and widely varying measurement errors , ( iv ) the presence of defined selection criteria , ( v ) the intrinsic scatter of the relation . in this paper we demonstrate that `` classical '' methods fail when confronted with the efar dataset , and we quantify the biases they produce .",

    ", it is worth considering the more general question of how to model the correlations existing between the structural parameters of galaxies . as usual in astrophysics ,",
    "logarithmic quantities are considered in order to avoid scaling problems . in the simplest approach ,",
    "one focuses on pairs of datapoints @xmath0 , looking for a linear relation @xmath1 between them .",

    "( 1990 ) ( see also eqs . [ eqyx]-[eqao ] below ) summarizes the estimates of the slopes @xmath2 and zeropoints @xmath3 , and their variances , derived using five methods ( y - x and x - y regressions , bisector , reduced major axis and orthogonal regression ) , when measurement errors are negligible .",
    "briefly , we recall that the y - x regression derives the slope @xmath4 and zero point @xmath5 of the line @xmath6 by minimizing the quantity : @xmath7 and the x - y regression by minimizing the analogous @xmath8 .",
    "the bisector solution gives the slope and zeropoint of the line passing in between the y - x and x - y lines .",
    "the reduced major axis slope is the geometric mean of the y - x and x - y slopes .",
    "the orthogonal regression derives @xmath9 and @xmath10 by minimizing the orthogonal residuals from the line : @xmath11 if the differences in slopes and zeropoints between the methods are smaller than the expected variance , a well - defined answer is found .",
    "unfortunately , this is rarely the case in astronomy .",
    "therefore , isobe et al . (",
    "1990 ) recommend astronomers use the y - x regression when it is clear that y is the variable to be `` predicted '' , and the bisector method when the functional relation between the variables has to be investigated .",
    "they discourage the use of the orthogonal regression , since its slope has greater dispersion .",
    "the problem is complicated when errors ( on one or both variables ) are present . in particular , feigelson and babu ( 1992 )",
    "conclude that `` models incorporating both measurement errors and intrinsic scatter are complex and not yet fully developed '' .",
    "akritas and bershady ( 1996 ) improve on this aspect , presenting an updated version of table 1 of isobe et al .",

    "isobe et al . (",

    "similarly , eq . [ eqxy ] shows that the same distribution can be generated first extracting the @xmath17 variable and then the residual @xmath40 around the @xmath36 line with slope equal to the regression of @xmath38 on @xmath37 .",
    "finally , eq . [ eqortho ] generates the distribution extracting the residuals around the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix .",
    "the direction of the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue is the slope of the orthogonal regression .",
    "the zero points @xmath3 of the relevant linear relations of slope @xmath2 are obtained from the mean values as : @xmath41    do we therefore conclude , as akritas and bershady ( 1996 ) , that `` there is no such thing as true slope '' ?",
    "in fact , the key of the problem is the covariance matrix , and therefore the natural slope is the direction of the principal axes ( given by eq . [ eqao ] ) with the largest eigenvalue ( given by eq .",
    "[ eqsigma1 ] ; eq .",
    "[ eqsigma2 ] is the second eigenvalue of the covariance matrix ) . as a consequence ,",

    "further complications arise when the datapoints @xmath0 are affected by errors comparable to the rms spreads @xmath18 and @xmath19 , or when only a subset of the possible data volume is available due to incompleteness .",
    "these affect the estimation of the covariance matrix @xmath27 and the mean values of the variables .",
    "for example , we estimate in appendix [ twodimlim ] that the orthogonal regression solution ignoring the errors underestimates the true slope if the error in the @xmath38 direction is larger than the one in @xmath37 .",
    "these effects might be included in the regression approach by careful treatement ( see references given in feigelson and babu 1992 ) , but it is clear from the discussion above that a maximum likelihood approach is superior , allowing the natural and simultaneous solution of all these difficulties .",
    "the efar database comprises photometric and spectroscopic information for a set of cluster galaxies spanning a factor of two in redshift , with non - negligible measurement errors and selection effects .",
    "the size of the errors can be quantified comparing the rms spread of the variables with the mean of the errors . in this sense",
    "photometric errors ( @xmath46 mag , see paper iii and iv ) are small in the efar database .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for the spectroscopic data ( see paper ii ) . for the case of the velocity dispersions",
    "@xmath47 , we find that the mean value ( 25 km / s ) of the measurement errors on @xmath47 is 36% of the rms spread of the values ( 71 km / s ) . for the mg@xmath3 index , the mean value ( 0.39  ) of the measurement errors is 48% of the rms spread of the values ( 0.83  ) .",
    "in addition , we can not measure central velocity dispersions smaller than 100 km / s for lack of spectral resolution .",
    "selection effects are also severe .",
    "the galaxy sample is more than 50% complete only for galaxies with @xmath48 kpc ( see paper i ) , with 46% of the galaxies having selection probabilities larger than 50% .",
    "the efar galaxy selection @xmath49 is described in paper i and is a function of the @xmath50 diameter measured in arcsec for galaxy @xmath51 : @xmath52\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the cluster index , @xmath54 is the midpoint and @xmath55 the width of the cutoff in the selection function .",
    "the diameter @xmath50 correlates with the @xmath56 diameter of the sample as @xmath57 with 0.09 dex scatter in @xmath56 ( see paper iii ) .",
    "therefore we compute the selection probabilities @xmath58 from the @xmath59 diameters derived from the very accurate @xmath56 instead of using the values of @xmath50 given in paper i. in the following we shall indicate with @xmath60 the selection probability for the galaxy @xmath51 , dropping the cluster index , and with @xmath61 the selection weight .    due to the large spread in redshift , the efar clusters have been sampled down to different limiting @xmath62(kpc ) .",
    "however , 95% of the early - types of the sample have @xmath63 kpc , so that nearly unbiased estimates of the cluster peculiar velocities can be obtained just by dropping from the sample objects with @xmath64 .    to our knowledge ,",
    "no algorithm based on linear regressions has been developed to model all these features at the same time . in the following",
    "we describe a parametric algorithm based on gaussian modelling able with to deal with ( i ) a spread of selection weights , ( ii ) sizeable measurement errors with a large spread , ( iii ) possible explicit selection limits .      in the general case , we have n ( logarithmic ) data @xmath65 for each galaxy @xmath51 .",
    "we indicate with @xmath66 the related @xmath67 error matrix .",

    "one variable @xmath72 may be distance dependent .",
    "we want to estimate the vector of the mean values of the data @xmath73 , the covariance matrix @xmath27 and , possibly , the vector @xmath74 of the m cluster peculiar velocity shifts . in this case",

    "the direction of the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix v defines the minimum variance hyperplane describing the data distribution , or the slope of the linear correlation in the two dimensional case .",

    "[ secvariant ] , this choice gives larger systematic and statistical errors for the fp parameters .",
    "we conclude that the peculiar velocity biases are much smaller than the random errors in the peculiar velocities .",
    "the uncertainties in the peculiar velocity bias corrections as computed from the 1000 simulations of case 1 used in paper vii do not increase the random errors in the peculiar velocities . however , residual systematic effects at the level of 0.01 dex might still be present , especially for the clusters at higher redshifts , due to the uncertainties in the determination of the selection function .",
    "=      given the large mean distance of the efar clusters , and the precision of the fp distance estimator ( 20% for the single galaxy , see paper vii ) , the present dataset does not allow the determination of the peculiar motions of single clusters .",
    "nevertheless , the mean motions of the efar clusters can be constrained . in the following",
    "we investigate this point using the subsample of clusters identified in paper vii for the study of the bulk motions .",
    "to this belong the 50 efar clusters with 3 or more galaxies ( hereafter peculiar velocity , pv , clusters ) , redshifts less than 15000 km / s , and peculiar velocity errors less than 1800 km / s .",
    "we compute the average mean velocities without applying the bias corrections investigated in  [ resbias ] ( although this is done in paper vii ) , to stress that our results are not affected much by these residual systematic uncertainties , and that random errors dominate the noise .",
    "we begin by examining the mean peculiar velocities @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 of the sample .",
    "these are the mean over the pv clusters , over the pv clusters with positive ( the hercules corona borealis , hcb , sample ) , and over the ones with negative galactic longitude ( the perseus pisces cetus , ppc , sample ) .",
    "[ figvmean ] shows that these average quantities are recovered with statistical errors of about 200 km / s . in general these errors",

    "in particular , errors on the selection function parameters do not affect the result much ( cases 20 to 23 ) and uniform distributions of the fp parameters , of the errors or both do not change this conclusion ( cases 45 to 47 ) .",

    "errors on the selection function parameters do not affect the result much ( cases 20 to 23 ) , as uniform distributions of the fp parameters , of the errors or both ( cases 45 to 47 ) .",
    "similarly , when the simulations with pure lp or smac dipole motions are considered ( cases 27 and 28 respectively ) , the recovered mean @xmath244 is consistent with the input values within the statistical uncertainties .",

    "in contrast , the simulations with a random peculiar velocity component ( case 24 ) give mean @xmath244 values similar to the observed values , both for the lp and the smac directions .",
    "simulations with a random component on top of the lp and smac bulk flows ( cases 25 and 26 ) produce large mean @xmath244 along the lp direction , and little net motion along the smac direction .",
    "=    finally , we investigate whether not only the mean motions , but also their global intrinsic fluctuations could be determined with the efar cluster sample . to this purpose",
    "we use the one - dimensional ml algorithm of  [ onedim ] : we consider the peculiar velocities derived for the 99 simulations of case 24 of table [ tabsimumean ] and their projections along the supergalactic x , y and z coordinates with their estimated errors , separately for the whole sample of pv clusters , and the northern hcb and southern ppc subsets . for each of these datasets",
    "the ml algorithm estimates the intrinsic ( gaussian ) dispersion .",
    "[ figrms ] shows the results .",
    "the derived rms are systematically underestimated , up to more than a factor two , when the input values are of the order of @xmath245 km / s , and by @xmath246% if larger input values are considered .",
    "we conclude that cluster sample is too small to allow an accurate determination of these quantities .",
    "=    to summarize , the efar cluster sample allows to measure the mean motions of the hcb and ppc regions with 200 km / s precision , and to constrain the bulk flow along the lp dipole direction strongly .",
    "it is less suited to constrain the smac result and does not allow the accurate determination of the random peculiar motion component .",
    "we have described the maximum likelihood gaussian algorithm we developed to investigate the correlations between the parameters of the efar database ( the  relation of paper ii , the  and  relations of paper v , the fundamental plane of paper vii ) and determine the cluster peculiar velocities of paper vii .",
    "we performed extensive testing based on mock catalogues of the efar sample .",
    "we find that `` canonical '' methods based on a least - squares approach can not cope with the challenge of a sample with a spread of a factor of two in redshift , with sizable selection effects , non - negligible and non - uniform errors , and explicit cuts .",
    "we quantify the size of the systematic biases these methods introduce .",
    "in contrast , the maximum likelihood gaussian algorithm takes into account errors , selection effects and the presence of explicit cuts , determining nearly - unbiased estimates of the slopes of the correlations and their intrinsic and parallel spread .",
    "ten to thirty percent of the analyzed simulations have mean likelihoods larger than that of the efar sample , justifying the use of gaussian modeling .",
    "we derive the analytical solution of the maximum likelihood gaussian problem in n dimensions in the presence of small errors .",
    "we show that the residual systematic biases are always smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "we investigate in detail the effects of cluster sample selection , errors in the selection function parameters , and selection cuts .",
    "we explore the cases of uniform distributions of parameters and errors .",
    "we conclude that the mean peculiar motions of the efar clusters can be determined reliably .",
