    "electric - magnetic duality in electromagnetism @xcite has been extended to non - abelian theories and , in particular , to @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym @xmath0 ) , ( s - duality)@xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that sym @xmath0 with gauge group @xmath2 and coupling constant @xmath7 is equivalent to sym @xmath0 with dual gauge group @xmath3 @xcite and dual coupling constant @xmath8 , with ^l=- for simply laced algebras , where = + , ^l= + .",
    "the symmetry has to be understood as an operator isomorphism between the two theories @xcite .",
    "since it interchanges electric and magnetic charges , it maps a wilson operator @xcite onto a t hooft operator @xcite and vice - versa .",
    "conjectures have also been suggested for chiral primary operators @xcite , surface operators @xcite and domain walls @xcite .",
    "an advance has recently been made with @xcite where the conjecture has been extended to correlation functions of gauge invariant operators .",
    "the set of observables in sym @xmath0 are related by the s - duality requirement _",
    "i o_i_g,=_i ^lo_i _ ^lg,^l .",
    "this property is both interesting and difficult to prove since it involves strong coupling calculations .",
    "the choice has been focused on a t hooft operator @xmath9 in a theory with gauge group @xmath2 , @xmath10 being a representation of the dual group @xmath3 .",
    "the expectation value of a t hooft loop can be computed by a path - integral where the integration is performed over all fields which have a prescribed singularity along the loop . in the weak coupling regime",
    "quantum fluctuations around the classical monopole configuration can also be obtained up to one loop order and a recipe has been provided to compute the loop perturbatively at any desired higher order .",
    "this result has subsequently been compared with a strong coupling calculation of a wilson loop with dual gauge group and dual coupling ( see ( [ dual ] ) ) . .5truecm    to compute wilson loops where some fractions of supersymmetries are preserved , one may resort to matrix models where explicit calculations are feasible , as conjectured in @xcite and proved in @xcite .",
    "a rather interesting family of contours can be obtained by coupling three of the six scalars and by restricting the contours to lie on a great @xmath11 inside @xmath12 .",
    "the related 1/8 bps loop operators are conjectured to correspond to the `` zero - instanton sector '' of the two - dimensional yang - mills theory ( @xmath13 ) on @xmath11 @xcite . in turn",
    "this was proved long ago to be equivalent to a gaussian matrix model with area dependent coupling @xmath14 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "several results which comply with this conjecture have appeared recently in @xcite .    from matrix models a strong coupling expression for the wilson loop",
    "can be extracted , to be compared with the weak coupling expression of the t hooft loop hitherto obtained .",
    "this can eventually be used to test the s - duality conjecture    [ dual ] t(^lr)_g,=w(^lr)_^lg,^l .",
    "an even bolder conjecture has been proposed in @xcite . after retrieving the correspondence between a ( supersymmetric ) wilson loop in sym @xmath15=4 and the zero - instanton sector of the loop in @xmath13",
    ", the authors extended this relation to suitable t hooft operators .",
    "more precisely they suggested that the expectation value of the 1/2 bps circular t hooft loop in representation @xmath16 in sym @xmath15=4 with gauge group @xmath2 and with an imaginary coupling ( @xmath17 ) could be obtained from the partition function @xmath18 of @xmath13 with gauge group @xmath2 around an unstable instanton @xcite labelled by @xmath10    [ ym2 ] t_^lr(c)_g,= , where the configuration @xmath19 is related to the boxes in the young tableau .",
    "similarly , correlation functions of the 1/2 bps t hooft loop with any number of 1/8 bps wilson loops inserted on the @xmath11 linked to the t hooft loop , could be computed in @xmath13 by calculating the wilson loop correlation functions around a fixed unstable instanton .",
    "these suggestions are particularly intriguing since they point towards endowing those instantonic sectors with a `` physical '' meaning .",
    "in fact in @xcite the check was limited to the k - antisymmetric representations of the gauge group @xmath20 , which can not be screened to give rise to sub - leading saddle points in the path integral localization ( the `` monopole bubbling '' phenomenon @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the choice of @xmath20 hid the possible occurrence of different representations @xmath21 and @xmath10 in the general case , @xmath20 being self - dual .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to extend the analysis to the gauge group @xmath22 and to its dual @xmath23 .    in sect.2",
    "we develop the harmonic analysis in @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the partition function and of a wilson loop .",
    "we remark that the poisson transformation , which is the bridge between the expansions in terms of characters and of unstable instantons respectively , provides us with two _ different _ expressions for the _ same _ quantity .",
    "in sect.3 we test the conjecture of ref.@xcite of a relation between a wilson loop in the @xmath24-fundamental representation of su(n ) and a t hooft loop , obtained by singling out in the partition function the contribution of an instanton belonging to the same representation .",
    "the test was successfully performed in @xcite for the group @xmath20 .",
    "the novelty in our case is that the @xmath24-irrep is not present in @xmath23 . as a consequence",
    "the test can only be exploited starting from @xmath23 for the partition function and ending in @xmath22 .",
    "then we discuss the case of the adjoint representation . in this case both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are viable .",
    "however it turns out that the instanton contribution to the partition function , which should correspond to a 1/2 bps t hooft loop in sym @xmath0 , indeed presents some extra terms ( subleading in @xmath25 ) with respect to the wilson loop in the same representation .",
    "this is a concrete realization of the possibility mentioned in @xcite and there interpreted as a subleading contribution in the path - integral localization of sym @xmath0 .",
    "limitations occurring when considering correlators between wilson loops and a t hooft loop are also briefly pointed out .",
    "finally sect.4 contains our conclusions together with some insight into possible future developments .",
    "the basic ingredient in computing the partition function and wilson loop correlators in @xmath13 with gauge group su(n ) is the heat kernel on a two - dimensional cylinder @xmath26 of area @xmath27 ( @xmath28=base circle , @xmath7 = length ) , and fixed holonomies at the boundaries @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the only geometrical dependence of the kernel is on its area , thanks to the invariance of @xmath13 under area - preserving diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "the kernel enjoys the basic sewing property [ heat ] k(l : u_2,u_1)=du(u ) k(lu;u_2,u(u))k ( l(-u));u(u),u_1 ) .",
    "the partition function on a sphere with area @xmath31 is expressed as @xmath32 .",
    "the kernel @xmath33 can be expanded as a series of the characters @xmath34 of all the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of su(n ) , according to the equation [ expa ] k(a;u_2,u_1)=_r",
    "^_r(u_2)_r(u_1 ) , @xmath35 being the quadratic casimir operator of the r- representation .    .3truecm",
    "now we move our interest to the group @xmath23 , @xmath36 being the center of @xmath22 .",
    "the elements of @xmath36 are the roots of unity @xmath37 the homotopy of @xmath23 is non trivial ; the bundles of @xmath23 over a two - dimensional closed oriented riemann surface @xmath38 can be topologically classified by the choice of a value of @xmath39 @xcite , @xcite .    to compute the partition function of @xmath13 ( and ,",
    "more generally , its basic propagation kernel ) one has to sum over the topologies of those bundles .",
