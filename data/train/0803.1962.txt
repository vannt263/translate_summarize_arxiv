    "the tendency of a spin in a spin-@xmath6 ising system to remain in its original state following a quench from infinite temperature to zero temperature has been extensively studied over the last decade and is an example of the phenomenon called persistence in dynamical systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath1 that a spin does not flip upto time @xmath2 , exhibits a power law behaviour p(t ) ~t^- , [ eq:5.1 ] where @xmath7 is a non - trivial exponent , as it is not related to any other static or dynamic exponent . in one dimension with nearest - neighbour interaction ,",
    "it has been proved exactly that this exponent is @xmath8 @xcite . in two dimensions , again with nearest - neighbour interaction , this exponent has been numerically evaluated @xcite as @xmath9 . for glauber dynamics ,",
    "the one - dimensional ising system is equivalent to a one - dimensional @xmath10 diffusion system ( see below ) .",
    "hence , the `` zero - dimensional '' persistent behaviour should correspond to that of a system of non - interacting particles initially spread randomly over a chain with density @xmath11 and then diffusing independent of each other .",
    "( the rule of diffusion is to take a step to the right or to the left with probability @xmath12 . )",
    "the persistence probability for this system has been shown @xcite to decay stretched - exponentially , p(t ) = [ eq:5.2 ] the objective of this communication is to report the observation that an ising system with nearest - neighbour interaction on a rectangular helical lattice , when quenched to zero - temperature from an infinite temperature shows zero- , one- and two - dimensional persistence behaviour in different regions of its temporal evolution . in the next section",

    "an explanation of the simulation results will also be presented in sec .",

    "we shall discuss some subtle issues .",
    "in this section we shall first describe the details of our system and our algorithm , and then present the results .",
    "consider ising spins @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 placed on a chain of @xmath17 sites with the periodic boundary condition @xmath18 .",
    "initially , each spin is @xmath19 or @xmath20 with equal probability .",
    "one iteration of the system consists of the following 4 steps : + ( i ) choose one ( say , @xmath21-th ) spin randomly , + ( ii ) calculate its energy e_k s_k(s_k-1 + s_k+1 + s_k - r + s_k+r ) , [ eq:5.3 ] + ( iii ) flip @xmath22 with probability 1 if @xmath23 , and with probability @xmath6 if @xmath24 ( do not flip at all if @xmath25 ) , + ( iv ) repeat the steps ( i ) to ( iii ) @xmath26 times more ( random updating ) .",
    "+ here , @xmath0 is a parameter of the model and must lie between @xmath27 and @xmath17 .",
    "clearly , we have nearest and @xmath0-th neighbour interaction and our system is equivalent to a nearest neighbour rectangular ising system of size @xmath28 .",
    "the lattice is _ not _ periodic in the two axial directions , rather the chain is wound as a helix of periodicity @xmath0 with the ends ( first and @xmath17-th sites ) put side by side ( fig .",
    "[ fig : helical ] ) .",
    "when @xmath29 , the system is effectively a one - dimensional one , while for @xmath30 it is a two - dimensional one with aspect ratio @xmath31 .",
    "in this communication we study the case of @xmath32 , so that the system is effectively one - dimensional , or at least a narrow strip .",
    "we do not consider the situation when the condition @xmath29 is not satisfied .",
    "after every iteration we compute the fraction of spins that has not been flipped till now .",
    "this fraction , averaged over many realisations of the system gives us the probability of persistence @xmath1 .",

    "this behaviour continues upto a certain time , say , @xmath35 . for a given @xmath17 ,",
    "the value of @xmath35 has been observed to increase with @xmath0 as @xmath36 ( fig .",

    "we call the region @xmath37 the",
    "_ first regime_. next follows the _ second regime _ extending upto some @xmath38 iteration where the @xmath39 curve has a small slope in the log - log scale .",
    "we shall see below that in this regime the system behaves as a zero - dimensional one . for limitation of computational resources",
    ", we could not achieve precise evaluation of @xmath38 , but could observe that , like @xmath35 , this quantity increases with @xmath0 . at last",
    "comes the _ third regime _ ( for @xmath40 ) where @xmath1 decays nearly as @xmath33 with @xmath41 showing the one - dimensional behaviour .",
    "we now explain the observations in the three regimes one by one , by approximate analytic arguments but an exact analytic calculation of the persistence behaviour spanning over the three regimes is yet to be done .    _ the first regime _ : here the system shows normal two - dimensional behaviour .",
    "the persistence curve @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 saturates at a time @xmath42 to a value that varies as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the dynamical critical exponent ( @xmath45 ) @xcite . after",
    "the system reaches the saturation stage , the domain walls ( lines separating unlike spins ) are mostly parallel to the x axis , with only a small number of kinks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : latt2 ] ) .",
    "the dynamics occurs only at these kinks , which we call ` @xmath46 particles ' . for the updating rule stated above , each @xmath46 particle jumps to the left or right with probabilities 1/2 , 1/2 , assuming that the walls are sparsely distributed over the system ( an @xmath46 particle does not have another at a distance @xmath47 ) .",
    "the density @xmath48 of @xmath46 particles , measured as the number of vertical domain walls per site is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntran.k10 ] .",
    "this quantity also shows a plateau region in the second regime , like persistence .",
    "it is important to note that , for a fully periodic system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodic ] , there can be only an even number of @xmath46 particles in a row .",
    "presence of one particle in a row is hence ruled out and two or more particles get annihilated within time @xmath35 .",
    "the dynamics therefore _ stops completely _ at @xmath49 in the case of a fully periodic system , and the second and the third regimes do not appear .",
    "_ the second regime _ : what happens to our ( helical ) system for @xmath50 ? for an interval of time",
    "@xmath51 , the @xmath46 particles ( kinks in the domain walls ) are so far away from each other that they can not `` see '' each other and diffuse independently . for a system of independent random walkers of density @xmath11",
    ", the persistence has been shown @xcite to obey eq .",
    "[ eq:5.2 ] . to compare our persistence data with eq .",
    "[ eq:5.2 ] , we assign each site to be persistent at @xmath49 .",
    "this makes @xmath52 and obliterates the distribution of persistent sites created in the first regime .",
    "then we note down the ( almost constant ) density @xmath48 in the second regime and observe that the @xmath1 data here obeys the relation p(t ) = 1 - _ a [ eq:5.4 ] with @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : secondreg3 ] ) . since the value of the slope @xmath54 is close to @xmath55 , and since the value of @xmath48 is small , eq .",
    "[ eq:5.2 ] is obeyed and we conclude that in the second regime , the system behaves as one of zero - dimension .    _ the third regime _",
    ": when the system evolves further ( @xmath56 ) , the @xmath46 particles start meeting ( and annihilating ) each other and the usual one - dimensional dynamics leads to @xmath33 behaviour with @xmath57 .",
    "since the density @xmath48 is too small , one needs to average over a large number of realisations and simulation of the third regime is a computationally intensive job .",
    "the @xmath39 curves remain the same for different values of @xmath17 for a given @xmath0 , but get shifted ( maintaining @xmath5 behaviour ) as one varies @xmath0 at a given @xmath17 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : phaseran ] and  [ fig : rr2ran.l10e3 ] ) . that the dynamics in the second and the third regimes is indeed described by simple one - dimensional @xmath58 dynamics",
    "is further corroborated by two numerical experiments : + ( i ) if we turn off the @xmath0-th neighbour interaction at @xmath59 , the slope of the persistence curve ( in log - log scale ) does not change much ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ranlongoff ] ) , indicating that it is chiefly the nearest - neighbour interaction that drives the dynamics .",
    "+ ( ii ) let us consider a periodic chain of @xmath17 sites and sprinkle randomly some particles ( excluding multiple occupancy at a site ) with density @xmath11 .",
    "starting with a low ( @xmath60 ) value of @xmath11 , we let the system evolve according to the usual @xmath58 dynamics .",
    "the result is the ( zero - dimensional ) second regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aaregime2 ] ) for the first 100 iterations , followed by the ( one - dimensional ) third regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aaregime3 ] ) . the second regime is found to follow eq .",
    "[ eq:5.2 ] with @xmath61 and the third regime shows the usual @xmath5 behaviour .",
    "\\(1 ) we shall first discuss a subtle issue regarding the dynamics in the third regime of the ising model .",
    "when two `` kinks '' of fig .",
    "[ fig : latt2 ] come closer than @xmath0 to each other , a domain of length less than @xmath0 is formed .",
    "the rules of update renders ( i ) every spin lying within this domain liable to flip ( with probability 1/2 ) and ( ii ) the two spins at the ends of this domain bound to flip ( with probability 1 ) .",
    "the dynamics thus differs from the one for the @xmath10 model , since once the domain is less than @xmath0 in length , it is swapped within the next @xmath0 steps .",
    "but since we are primarily interested in the region @xmath62 , this difference is not of much consequence .",
    "one can flip the spins _ only _ at the ends of the domain ( keeping the ones within the domain unflipped ) if we replace the energy expression of eq .",
    "[ eq:5.3 ] by e_k s_k[s_k-1 + s_k+1 + ( s_k - r + s_k+r ) ] [ eq:5.5 ] and choose @xmath63 .",
    "we have checked that the persistence behaviour still remains almost the same .",
    "\\(2 ) in the case of @xmath10 model with initial density @xmath64 , we have shown a @xmath5 behaviour in fig .",
    "[ fig : aaregime3 ] .",
    "however , one comes across anomalous behaviour at somewhat larger system size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a1all ] ) .",
    "thus , after the third regime continues for some time , one comes across another saturation region , with the saturation value _ increasing _ with increase of @xmath17 .",
    "we did not observe such anomalous behaviour for the ising system .",
    "work is in progress on this issue .",
    "\\(3 ) it is interesting to note that when the range @xmath0 of the long - range interaction varies from site to site and takes any integer value chosen randomly between @xmath27 and @xmath17 , the persistence behaviour almost vanishes @xcite . since we have found the persistence behaviour to remain upto time @xmath65 , for a given value of @xmath0 we conclude that the random nature of @xmath0 tends to remove the persistence behaviour ."
