    "we also conclude that the dominant source of emission in the sl2 wavelength regime for comet c/2003 k4 ( linear ) is the water @xmath2 band .",

    "[ fig : k4opr ] , we see that a narrow ( @xmath104 0.1  ) residual emission feature is present near @xmath217.3  ( 1370 cm@xmath6 ) . a small spectral segment of the _ spitzer _ irs data near 7.3  , shown in fig .  [ fig:7p3mu - spec ] , provides detailed , close - up view of this emission feature .",
    "the origin of this feature is unclear . the peak flux and integrated feature flux is in excess of that anticipated from spurious fringe signal power .",
    "a possible candidate is emission from the so@xmath16  @xmath51 band at 7.34  that has a fluorescence emission rate at 1 au from the sun of @xmath106  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "synthetic spectra of so@xmath16  @xmath51 band obtained using the hitran database @xcite approximately match the width of the feature , but the central wavelengths do not coincide .",
    "in addition , the measured intensity in the spectrum obtained at 7.2  offset in the coma of comet c/2003 k4 ( linear ) , @xmath107  w  @xmath102 , would imply a so@xmath16/h@xmath16o production rate ratio of 2.5% , a factor 10 times higher than measured in comet c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that the observed 7.3  feature is due to so@xmath16 .",
    "the nist database provides band positions of a number of gas phase species , including organics .",
    "no satisfactory candidate could be found .",
    "for example , methyl formate hcooch@xmath108 , identified in cometary atmospheres @xcite , has a band of medium strength at 1371 cm@xmath6 , but also a much stronger band at 1754 cm@xmath6 ( 5.7  ) which is not seen in the _ spitzer _ spectra .",
    "acetic acid exhibits a strong band at 1375 cm@xmath6 , but a still stronger one at 1248 cm@xmath6 ( 6.94  ) .",
    "if the feature is originating from a gas phase species , then the abundance of this molecule relative to water should be on the order of 1% or more , based on the measured intensity and typical fluorescence emission rates in cometary environment .",
    "the 7.3  wavelength corresponds to the characteristic vibrational frequency of the ch@xmath108 `` umbrella '' deformation mode ( @xmath211375 cm@xmath6 ) .",
    "a 7.3   absorption feature has been detected in some galactic and extragalactic sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and assigned to aliphatic hydrocarbons . however , an absorption signature at 6.85  is also observed , corresponding to ch@xmath16 bending vibrations .",
    "spectra of various carbonaceous refractory materials , including chondritic material , that contain aliphatic chains show that these two features are present as a doublet with intensity ratio @xmath109m@xmath110/@xmath111m@xmath110 @xmath62 1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , no residual emission is observed at 6.8  in the comet c/2003 k4 ( linear ) spectrum .",
    "therefore , aliphatic hydrocarbons are not likely the source of the cometary 7.3  feature , although such compounds have been identified in the material captured from comet 81p / wild  2 by the stardust spacecraft @xcite .",
    "a few galactic and extragalactic sources exhibit a weak emission feature at 7.37.4  ( with no 6.85  counterpart ) that shows up on the wing of the well known strong 7.7  complex attributed to cc stretching / ch in plane bending vibrations of aromatics ( likely pahs ) compounds @xcite . based on theoretical calculations of expected cc stretching band positions of pahs of various complexity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this weak component is likely a pah signature .",
    "however , the comet feature may have a different origin as no strong 6.8 and 7.7  pah emission is evident in the _ spitzer _ spectra of c/2003 k4 ( linear ) .",
    "we have observed the @xmath2 vibrational band of water in comet c/2003 k4 ( linear ) within 5.5 to 7.6  _ spitzer _ irs spectra , deriving a water production rate of @xmath5  molec .",
    "s@xmath6 when the comet was at a pre - perihelion heliocentric distance of 1.760  au .",
    "although the irs spectra are of moderate resolution , modeling of the observed emission in the 5.7 to 6.8  region constrained the water spin temperature to be @xmath4  k. the measured @xmath95 is comparable to that of other oort cloud comets and suggestive of a common formation zone for the precometary water ices that eventually agglomerated into the nuclei , though the precise interpretation of the opr as a probe of the primordial formation zones of comets in the protosolar nebula remains controversial @xcite .",
    "the observed decrease ( at 3-@xmath42 confidence level ) of the water rotational temperature with cometocentric distance is compatible with evolution from thermal to fluorescence equilibrium and constrains somewhat the role of electron collisions in water excitation .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the gas is poorly constrained .",
    "neither emission from carbonates nor pahs was necessary to account for any emission in excess of the continuum at wavelengths between 5 to 7  , suggesting that these species are not present in the coma of c/2003 k4 ( linear ) at the abundance levels measured by @xcite in comet 9p / tempel 1 .",
