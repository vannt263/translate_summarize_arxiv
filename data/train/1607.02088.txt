    "the globular clusters ( gcs ) m15 ( ngc7078 ) and m92 ( ngc6341 ) are generally thought to have very close to the same metallicity ( see the spectroscopic surveys by e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and age ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest argument in support of coevality is that color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies have shown that the difference in magnitude between the turnoff ( to ) and the horizontal branch ( hb ) is nearly identical for these two systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "originally , this so - called  @xmath11  parameter \" was measured at the color of the to ( @xcite ) , but the uncertainty of @xmath12 can easily be as high as @xmath13 mag , implying @xmath14(age ) @xmath15 gyr , because of the difficulty of determining the magnitude of the bluest point in a sequence of stars that is , by definition , vertical at the to .",
    "much more precise ages can be derived by fitting isochrones to the arc of stars from @xmath16 mag below the to through to a point on the subgiant branch ( sgb ) that is @xmath17 mag redder than the to , in conjunction with fits of zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) models to the cluster hb populations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter v13 ) ; @xcite ) . using this technique , which builds on the approaches advocated by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", v13 found that m15 and m92 have the same age to within @xmath18 gyr .",
    "[ the shapes of modern isochrones in the vicinity of the to , in particular , appear to be quite a robust prediction and , in fact , stellar models are able to reproduce the turnoff portions of observed cmds rather well when up - to - date color@xmath4 relations ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cv14 ) ) are employed ; see v13 . ]",
    "however , this result is not yet ironclad  primarily because the two gcs have very different hb morphologies . indeed ,",
    "m15 is not at all like the majority of clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath19 , including m92 , whose hb populations are located predominately to the blue of the instability strip ( is ) , and their rr lyrae stars constitute just a small fraction of the total number of core helium - burning stars . in m92-like hbs , both the paucity of variables and their high pulsation periods , relative to those determined for rr lyrae in more metal - rich clusters ( like m3 ) , can be plausibly explained if these variables evolved into the is from zahb locations on the blue side of the is , where most of the hb stars are found ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    curiously , m15 has a horizontal branch that spans a much wider range in color than is typical of extremely metal - deficient gcs , and it is so rich in rr lyrae that a large fraction of its variables must have evolved from zahb structures inside the is ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . yet , the mean period of its @xmath0-type rr lyrae stars agrees very well with the values of @xmath5  that have been derived for other oosterhoff type ii ( hereafter , oo ii ) systems ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite ) ) , including m92 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* his table 2 ) .",
    "this suggests that , at the same intrinsic color , m15 and m92 variables have similar luminosities ; and therefore that ( in the mean at least ) m15 rr lyrae lie above the extension into the is of the same zahb which provides a good fit to the main non - variable , blue hb population of m92 ( as well as its counterpart in m15 )",
    ".    there is another important difference between m15 and other gcs of very low metallicity in that it is the only one which has been found to have a signficant dispersion in the abundances of heavy neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this may be ( probably is ) connected with the fact that m15 is one of the most luminous , and thus most massive , clusters in the galaxy .",
    "indeed , other systems with integrated @xmath20 ( see the latest version of the @xcite catalogueharris / mwgc.dat ] ) generally exhibit the largest chemical abundance anomalies ; see , for instance , recent investigations of 47 tuc ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ngc2808 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ngc2419 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ngc6441 ( @xcite ) and m2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , as discussed in , e.g. , the studies of 47 tuc by @xcite and of ngc2808 by @xcite and @xcite , consequences of the observed ( or inferred , in the case of helium ) abundance variations for their hb populations can often be identified . to be specific , di criscienzo et al",
    ".  found that the best match to the observed hb morphology of 47 tuc is obtained if synthetic hb populations are generated on the assumption of @xmath21 for the initial he abundances ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "this is approximately the dispersion in @xmath9 that has been inferred from the width of the cluster ms by @xcite .",
    "similarly , dalessandro et al .  and marino et al .  have found that the very unusual hb of ngc2808 can be explained if it consists of sub - populations of stars with low , intermediate , and high helium abundances that are consistent with the values of @xmath9 implied by the cluster s triple ms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it may turn out that the hb of m15 can not be satisfactorily explained except as a superposition of multiple stellar populations  something which has long been suspected ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    indeed , ( * ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) have recently speculated that the presence of different _ generations _ of stars , which assumes that resident chemically distinct populations formed at different times ( @xcite ) , may be responsible for the appearance of the observed hbs in _ most _ clusters , as well as their separation into oosterhoff groups . in their scenario , core helium - burning stars with normal helium abundances ( @xmath22 ) populate a different range in color on the hb than those with slightly higher @xmath9 , enhanced cno abundances , and younger ages ( by 12 gyr ) , and ( if they exist ) still younger stars with much higher @xmath9 .",
    "that is , the spread in color on the hb would be due more to the differences in the ages and the abundances of helium and cno of the existing subgroups than to a large dispersion in mass at nearly constant @xmath9 and [ cno / fe ] , which is the canonical explanation ( @xcite ) . since hbs are shifted to the red as the metallicity increases , the stars that are located in the is could belong mostly to the first , second , or third generation depending on the cluster [ fe / h ] , possibly producing the observed rr lyrae period shifts ( see jang et al .",
    ", their fig .  1 and the accompanying discussion . ) .",
    "however , although difficult to measure , c@xmath23n@xmath23o appears to be constant to within measuring uncertainties in most gcs ; see , e.g. , the spectroscopic results obtained for m4 by @xcite , for ngc6397 and ngc6752 by @xcite , and for m3 and m13 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) . to date",
    ", there is compelling evidence for large star - to - star [ cno / fe ] variations only in ngc1851 ( @xcite ) , though there is some suggestion from photometric data that 47 tucanae harbors a minor cno - enhanced population of stars in its core ( @xcite ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite in the case of ngc1851 , large variations in [ cno / fe ] cause the sgb to be broadened , or split , and since this is not commonly seen in gc cmds ( see , e.g. , the _ hst _ photometric survey carried out by @xcite ) , intrinsic spreads in [ cno / fe ] larger than @xmath24 dex are effectively ruled out ( unless the effects of age and [ cno / fe ] variations compensate each other ) .",
    "indeed , even well - developed o  na and mg ",
    "al anti - correlations , such as those derived for stars in m13 by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , can be reproduced remarkably well by theoretical models if the h - burning occurs at a sufficiently high temperature ( @xmath25 k ) and both c@xmath23n@xmath23o and the total number of mg and al nuclei are constant ( see @xcite ) .    at the present time , supermassive stars ( @xcite ) are the only known nucleosynthesis site that has the required h - burning temperatures to achieve this consistency between theory and observations without requiring large _",
    "ad hoc _ modifications to the rates of relevant nuclear reactions .",
    "stars could have formed at essentially the same time as the cn - rich , o - poor , na - rich , @xmath26  stars if such chemical abundance variations within gcs have , e.g. , a supermassive star origin .",
    "] thus there are ample reasons to question the variations in cno and age that underpin the explanation of the oosterhoff dichotomy suggested by @xcite and @xcite . to properly evaluate the validity of their proposals",
    ", one should first examine how well updated models for the evolution of hb stars are able to explain both the morphologies of the observed hbs in gcs and the periods of their rr lyrae variables .",
    "since the difference in @xmath5  between oo ii systems ( m15 , m92 ) and oo i clusters ( e.g. , m3 ) is of particular interest , a careful consideration of the m3 hb is included in this investigation .    after describing our evolutionary computations in  [ sec : models ] ,",
    "fits of isochrones to the cluster tos and of evolutionary tracks for the core he - burning phase to the observed hbs are presented in  [ sec : obs ] , along with comparisons of the predicted and observed periods of their rr lyrae .",
    "the main results of this study are summarized and briefly discussed in  [",
    "sec : sum ] .",
    "all stellar models that are used in this investigation to fit the main sequence ( ms ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) photometric sequences of gcs were generated using the victoria evolutionary code , as described in considerable detail by @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "we have made use of the computations for [ @xmath27/fe ] @xmath28 from ( * ? ? ? * hereafter v14 ) , since this is approximately the observed enhancement of the @xmath27-elements in metal - poor clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as several new grids that allow for [ o / fe ] values as high as @xmath29 ( i.e. , @xmath30[o / fe ] @xmath31 above the amount implied by the adopted value of [ @xmath27/fe ] ) .",
    "( the latter represent just a small subset of the extensive sets of tracks and isochrones , to be made publicly available in a forthcoming paper , in which [ o / fe ] is treated as a free parameter . ) both m92 and m15 , in particular , could be expected to have high oxygen abundances if the variation of [ o / fe ] with [ fe / h ] that has been derived for extremely metal - deficient stars in the galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite ) applies to them . in fact , it may not be possible to explain the reddest hb stars in m15 without assuming very high oxygen abundances ( see  [ subsec : m15 ] ) . as documented in the appendix of the paper by v14 , the elegant interpolation software developed by p.  bergbusch",
    "enables us to generate isochrones for arbitrary [ fe / h ] , @xmath9 , and [ o / fe ] within the ranges for which evolutionary tracks have been computed .",
    "because a suitable treatment of semi - convection or core overshooting in helium - burning stars has not yet been incorporated into the victoria code , the evolution of stars past their zahb locations has never been followed .",
    "however , it has already been demonstrated ( see @xcite ) that tracks for the ms and rgb phases are nearly identical with those predicted by the mesa code ( @xcite ) when very similar physics is assumed .",
    "if similar good agreement is found in the case of the respective zahb models , then no significant inconsistencies are introduced by using the mesa code to generate zahb loci and post - zahb tracks while employing victoria isochrones to describe the earlier evolutionary phases . [",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the victoria code contains an implementation of the @xcite non - lagrangian method of solving the stellar structure equations ( see @xcite ) , which is designed to follow the evolution of a very thin h - burning shell along the rgb very efficiently .",
    "indeed , the entire track from the base of the giant branch until the onset of the helium flash , which is the only part of the evolution of a star that utilizes this technique , can be computed in less than 0.5% of the _ cpu _ time required by codes that take mass to be the independent variable . ]",
    "it turns out that , as illustrated in figure 1 , there is excellent consistency between mesa and victoria tracks and zahb loci . both sets of calculations assumed exactly the same abundances of helium ( @xmath32 ) and the heavier elements ; specifically ,",
    "the solar metals mixture given by @xcite , with a 0.4 dex enhancement of the @xmath27-elements , then scaled to [ fe / h ] @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( as indicated ) .",
    "since this mix of the heavy elements had been previously considered by v14 , we were able to use the same opacities that had been generated for that project via the livermore laboratory opal opacity web site and those calculated using the code described by @xcite for high- and low - temperatures , respectively .",
    "in addition , _ for this particular comparison _ , the preferred rates from the jina _ reaclib _ database ( @xcite ) for the most important h- and he - burning nuclear reactions were incorporated into the victoria code so that this component of the stellar physics would be identical to the treatment adopted in the very recent version of the mesa code ( specifically , release 7624 ) that has been used throughout this investigation .",
    "although mesa has a large number of parameters that provide the means to control the speed and accuracy of the model computations , and to choose among different prescriptions for the equation of state , the nuclear reaction network , the reaction rates , etc . , we used default values of all , but one , of these parameters .",
    "the best agreement with victoria stellar models is obtained if cubic interpolations of the opacities with respect to @xmath35 are adopted instead of quadratic interpolations ( the default option ) .",
    "( in the victoria code , cubic splines are employed to evaluate the opacities at different values of @xmath35 . ) for consistency , we chose the  krishna - swamy \" option ( see @xcite ) for the atmospheric @xmath36@xmath37  relation , as well as the  henyey \" option ( @xcite ) for the treatment of the mixing - length theory of convection , with the mixing - length equal to 2.0 pressure scale - heights .",
    "this is very close to the value found from a standard solar model ( see v14 ) .    in comparison with the models computed by v14",
    ", the  victoria \" tracks that appear in fig .",
    "1 are cooler by only @xmath38 , while predicting the same rgb - tip age to within 0.02 gyr .",
    "the adoption in the published 2014 models of a slightly reduced rate ( from @xcite ) for the @xmath39n@xmath40o reaction , as compared with the jina rate for this reaction , also has minor consequences for zahb models , in that the helium core mass at the top of the giant branch is reduced by @xmath41 , which translates to a lower luminosity by @xmath42 mag at a fixed @xmath4  on the hb ( when differences in the model @xmath4 scale are also taken into account ) .",
    "thus , for instance , the zahb - based distance moduli derived by v13 would have been reduced by @xmath43 mag , implying increased ages by @xmath44 gyr , had their models been based on the jina nuclear reaction rates ( @xcite ) instead of the adopted ones .",
    "be that as it may , fig .",
    "1 shows that the evolutionary tracks and zahbs computed by the mesa and victoria codes are in excellent agreement when both employ very close to the same physics .",
    "this figure provides ample justification for combining mesa models for the hb phase with victoria isochrones for the ms and rgb phases .",
    "the prediction of slightly higher ages by the victoria code ( by @xmath45% , see fig .",
    "1 ) appears to be due mostly to small differences in the respective equation - of - state ( eos ) formulations , though differences in , e.g. , some of the numerical methods that are used could be part of the explanation .",
    "exploratory computations that we carried out revealed that most of this difference would be eliminated if we used the eos developed by a.  irwin , widely known as  freeeos \" , to generate the victoria track instead of the default eos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is normally favored because it is computationally much faster than freeeos ( by at least a factor of 3 if the eos4 implementation of freeeos is employed , and by much larger factors if eos1eos3 are used ) .",
    "this is an important advantage when generating large grids of tracks and isochrones .",
    "errors at the level of @xmath46% are , anyway , much smaller than those associated with current distance and metal abundance ( especially [ o / fe ] ) determinations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that mesa can follow the evolution of a track through the core helium flash all the way to the hb ( and beyond ) , which requires several thousand stellar models .",
    "indeed , the most massive zahb model is always created in this way .",
    "mass is then removed from the envelope of this initial model , in small increments , to generate lower mass zahb models .",
    "the victoria code , on the other hand , inserts into a previously converged zahb structure the chemical abundance profiles from an appropriate red - giant precursor ( one in which the he - burning luminosity has exceeded @xmath47 ) , and then relaxes that structure via many short timesteps until the central he abundance has decreased by @xmath48 from an initial value of @xmath49 , where @xmath35 is the total mass - fraction abundance of the metals .",
    "this endpoint is suggested by mesa models that have been evolved through the helium flash .",
    "it is just a matter of repeating this procedure , on the assumption of the same helium core mass but different envelope masses , until an entire zahb extending to , say , @xmath50 has been generated . as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 , this classical , computationally much less demanding approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) works extremely well if executed carefully .",
    "( for a discussion of the methods that have been used to compute zahb models , see @xcite . )",
    "the subsequent evolution of low - mass hb stars is known to be strongly dependent on the treatment of mixing at the boundary of the convective helium core ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) . because c - rich material below that boundary has a higher opacity than the he - rich matter above it , a discontinuity is created in the ratio of the radiative and adiabatic temperature gradients , @xmath51 , at the boundary . as the core grows in mass and becomes more enriched in carbon , this ratio can exceed 1.0 at the boundary , while the minimum value inside the core falls below unity .",
    "such a variation of @xmath51 with mass implies that this region will split into a smaller convective core and a surrounding zone that undergoes semi - convective mixing .",
    "unfortunately , precisely how this mixing occurs is still an open question due to the lack of suitable 3d hydrodynamical simulations that treat all of the relevant microphysics ( e.g. , nuclear reactions , opacity variations ) on a thermal timescale .    in the absence of such simulations ,",
    "a number of different mixing prescriptions , considered to be reasonable , have been developed for use in post - zahb models in the hope that reasonable consistency with observational constraints would be found .",
    "let it suffice it to say that @xcite have recently concluded that their proposed  maximal overshoot \" treatment of mixing in convective cores results in stellar structures whose non - radial pulsations appear to match those of field hb stars , as derived from _ kepler _ observations , better than those computed for models that have implemented other mixing prescriptions . based on these findings",
    ", we have fine - tuned the values of the parameters that control convective overshooting in the mesa code so that our models for the hb phase have evolving he abundance profiles that closely resemble those reported by @xcite for their  maximal overshoot \" case .",
    "( a full accounting of what we have done , supported by relevant plots , will be provided in a later paper in this series by p.  denissenkov et al .",
    "the same paper will make the grids of hb tracks used in this investigation available to the astronomical community . )",
    "compared with models that neglect core overshooting , our models predict more massive he cores and longer core he - burning lifetimes ( @xmath52 myr ) by nearly a factor of two . in addition , our evolutionary tracks do not contain loops caused by so - called  core breathing pulses \" , in good agreement with the most recent estimates of the r@xmath53 parameter that measures the relative lifetimes of asymptotic - giant - branch and hb stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since the main goal of this investigation is to obtain ( if possible ) fully consistent interpretations of the msto and hb populations in m3 , m15 , and m92 , our analysis of each cluster begins by determining its distance and age . to accomplish this , all of the observed colors are first dereddened , assuming an estimate of @xmath7 that is supported by analyses of dust maps ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for colors other than @xmath54 , we have used @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 have the values given by cv14 ( see their table a1 ) for filters @xmath58  and @xmath59 .",
    "then , to determine the apparent distance modulus , the observed magnitudes are adjusted until the lower bound of the distribution of member hb stars coincides with a zahb that has been computed for an adopted value of @xmath9 , and for assumed metal abundances that are consistent with recent spectroscopic results . having set the value of @xmath8 in this way , it is a straightforward matter to fit isochrones for the same initial chemical abundances as the zahb to the turnoff photometry in order to derive the corresponding age .",
    "( it has already been shown by v13 that current zahb loci reproduce the morphologies of observed hbs very well , especially in the case of gcs that have [ fe / h ] @xmath60 , and that they seem to be very good distance indicators . )    to complete our analysis , the full grid of hb evolutionary tracks on which the zahb locus was based is overlaid onto the observed hb population . via suitable interpolations within this grid , the effective temperatures , luminosities , and masses that correspond to published determinations of the mean magnitudes and colors of the rr lyrae variables ( i.e. , the properties of equivalent  static stars \" ) are determined .",
    "this information , together with the value of @xmath35 that was assumed in the model computations , enable one to calculate the periods , in units of days , of the @xmath0-type ( fundamental mode ) and @xmath1-type ( first overtone ) pulsators using the equations ( from @xcite ) : @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( these results were derived from state - of - the - art hydrodynamical models of rr lyrae variables that employ a nonlinear , nonlocal , time - dependent treatment of convection . ) once the periods predicted by the stellar models have been determined , they are compared with the observed periods on a star - by - star basis .",
    "it can be anticipated from the preceding remarks that several plots have been prepared for each cluster , and indeed , we now turn to a presentation and discussion of these plots .",
    "we begin with m3 , mainly because an analysis of its cmd and rr lyrae population appears to be relatively free of difficulties , and end with m15 , which poses a much greater challenge than either m3 or m92 .    [",
    "[ subsec : m3 ] ] m3 ~~    as it is usually worthwhile to examine fits of isochrones to as many different cmds as possible , we have opted to consider both the _ hst _ photometry of m3 that was obtained by @xcite and the latest calibration of ground - based @xmath63 data by p.  stetson ( as described , and used , in the study by @xcite ) .",
    "a plot of the @xmath64 observations is shown in figure 2 , which illustrates that a zahb for the indicated chemical abundances provides quite a good match to the lower bound of the distribution of non - variable hb stars at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the isochrone , for the same abundances , that provides the best fit to the to and sgb is one for an age of @xmath67 gyr .",
    "while a small color offset had to be applied to the isochrone in order to match the observed turnoff color , this has no impact on the inferred age ( see v13 ) .",
    "it does indicate , however , that there must be a small problem with , e.g. , the model @xmath4 scale , the adopted color transformations , the photometric zero - points , and/or the assumed chemical composition .",
    "regardless , the level of agreement between theory and observations is quite satisfactory when the adopted or derived properties of m3 are close to currently favored values ( see , e.g. , the entries for this gc in the latest edition of the catalog by ( * ? ? ? * see our footnote 4 ) ) .",
    "the same can be said of figure 3 , which is identical to fig .  2 except that the isochrones are compared with the principal photometric sequences of m3 on the @xmath68$]-plane .",
    "interestingly , the predicted and observed turnoff colors agree to within 0.002 mag , but the cluster rgb is offset to the blue by a larger amount than in the previous plot . because of the many factors that play a role in such comparisons , it is not easy to determine which one is mostly responsible for these discrepancies .",
    "it seems unlikely that they can be attributed primarily to errors in the predicted temperatures because any @xmath4  adjustments that eliminate the problems in one cmd will exacerbate the difficulties in the other cmd  especially in view of the similarity between @xmath69  and johnson - cousins @xmath70 . aside from small zero - point errors ,",
    "the photometry is probably quite reliable in a systematic sense , but this may not be true of current color@xmath4 relations . in any case , it is very encouraging to find that the quality of the fits to both the hb and the to observations are comparable in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "remarkably , of the three cmds that have been considered , the same stellar models provide the best match to the @xmath71$]-diagram of m3 , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "this is unexpected because the blanketing is more severe , and hence more problematic from the modeling perspective , in the @xmath72 bandpass than at longer wavelengths .",
    "24 thus demonstrate that inconsistencies in predicted colors at the level of a few hundredths of a magnitude , especially for cool stars , are unavoidable . however , the zahb - based _ apparent _ distance moduli and predicted ages are largely independent of color - related uncertainties .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xcite used the same isochrones , but different zahb models , in their fits to the same @xmath73 photometry of m3 .",
    "they obtained an age of 12.25 gyr , which is slightly younger than our determination ( 12.4 gyr ) , because they adopted a slightly larger value of @xmath8 .",
    "an even younger age ( 11.75 gyr ) was derived by v13 in their survey of gc ages , due mainly to their use of stellar models that assumed a significantly higher abundance of oxygen , which more than compensated for a reduced distance modulus .",
    "the rr lyrae that appear in fig .  4 as red dots were taken from the study by ( * ? ? ? * their tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "all variables that were flagged as having large scatter in their light curves or low amplitudes ( a possible sign of blends ) , or which exhibited some evidence for the presence of companions or for the blazhko effect ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) , were removed from the sample . however , even when such strict selection criteria are adopted  which we can afford to employ in the case of such an rr lyrae - rich cluster as m3  we are still left with a total sample of 69 variables , 46 of which are fundamental ( @xmath0-type ) pulsators and 23 of which are first - overtone ( @xmath1-type ) pulsators .",
    "@xcite converted colors ( but not magnitudes ) to their static equivalents , based on the prescriptions given by @xcite .",
    "( fortunately , the differences between the static colors so derived and magnitude - weighted mean colors are typically @xmath74 mag . ) by interpolating in the bono et al .",
    "tables , we were able to compute the static @xmath75 magnitudes for the m3 rr lyrae .",
    "it turns out that they generally agree to within @xmath76 mag with the mean magnitudes given by cacciari et al . , who integrated the light curves in intensity and then converted the resultant integrations to magnitudes .",
    "accordingly , we have simply adopted the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 that are tabulated by cacciari et al .",
    "figure 5 focuses in on the region of the cmd that contains the rr lyrae and non - variable hb stars of m3 , as well as cluster giants that lie within the same range of @xmath79 . the stars and zahb that appeared in the previous figure",
    "are reproduced here , but different symbols are used to identify the fundamental and first - overtone pulsators ( as noted ) .",
    "a grid of post - zahb tracks , for the same initial chemical abundances that were assumed in the isochrones ( see figs .",
    "24 ) and for masses in the range of 0.800.58 @xmath80  ( in the direction from red to blue colors ) has been superimposed on the observations .",
    "they begin at the zahb and end when the central helium abundance has fallen to @xmath81 , which typically takes @xmath82  myr . except for the four most massive hb models ,",
    "evolutionary sequences were computed for masses that differed by @xmath83  in the vicinity of the instability strip , rising to @xmath84  for the hottest models .",
    "this spacing is sufficiently fine that precise predictions of the masses , luminosities , and effective temperatures of the rr lyrae stars can be obtained simply by linear interpolations within the grid ( or by extrapolating just outside of it , in the case of the brightest variables ) .",
    "since the stellar models were computed for @xmath85 , the periods of the variables can be calculated using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and then compared with the observed periods .",
    "the results of this exercise are better than one might have expected ( as we will show shortly ) , though the computed periods for the @xmath0-type variables tend to be somewhat too low .",
    "the most likely explanations of this problem are ( i ) the predicted temperatures are too high  despite the fact that isochrones need to be shifted to the blue to match the turnoff color , which goes in the opposite direction , ( ii ) the values of @xmath78 given by @xcite are too blue , or ( iii ) the coefficient that multiplies @xmath86 should be reduced ( in an absolute sense ) .",
    "it is well known that the temperatures of stellar models are much more uncertain than their luminosities , and @xmath4  uncertainties will obviously have a much bigger impact on the calculated periods of rr lyrae than those associated with luminosities or masses .",
    "in fact , rather good consistency between the predicted and observed periods , and the corresponding value of @xmath5 ,  and @xmath6  to represent the average periods , either predicted or observed , of the selected samples of cluster rr lyrae stars . to properly predict the mean periods",

    "such low values of @xmath195  have never been found in studies of star cluster cmds ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , which provide far better constraints on the value of this parameter than the properties of single stars ( aside from the sun ) because the location and slope of the giant branch , as well as the length of the sgb , are very sensitive to the treatment of convection ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these features can not be reproduced unless a high value of @xmath195  is assumed ( see figs .  24 , 9 , and 11 in the present paper ) .",

    "the uncertainties of the various factors that play a role in comparisons of isochrones with observed cmds are such that small variations in the mixing - length parameter with mass , chemical abundances , or evolutionary state can not be ruled out , but neither has it been possible to argue compellingly in support of such variations ( also see @xcite ) .",

    "however , let us first revisit the v13 analysis in the light of some improvements that can be made to the cmds of m15 and m92 and the use of different zahb models and isochrones .",
    "especially well - defined cmds can be obtained by ( i ) separating the ms and rgb stars in the @xcite catalog from those that lie to the blue of the giant branch , ( ii ) sorting the two samples into 0.1 mag bins , and ( iii ) ranking the stars in each bin in terms of @xmath244 , where @xmath244 is the smaller of the tabulated values of @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",

    "the right - hand panel shows that the same zahb provides a very good fit to the hb population of m15 if @xmath249 , which agrees very well with recent determinations of line - of - sight reddenings from dust maps ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and @xmath250 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the same age is found for m15 as for m92 , though the best - fit isochrone must be shifted by 0.032 mag to the blue to match the observed turnoff color , as compared with 0.013 mag in the case of m92 .",
    "figure  16 provides an alternative way of illustrating this difference .",
    "the left - hand panel reproduces the m92 photometry from the previous figure for just the upper main sequence , subgiant , and lower rgb stars , on the assumption of exactly the same reddening and distance modulus . using the methods described by v13 ( see their ",

    "when compared with the m15 observations from fig  15 for @xmath251 ( see the right - hand panel ) , this sequence is obviously too red by about 0.02 mag to represent the m15 cmd .",
    "one might conclude from this intercomparison that the adopted reddening of m15 is too high , since a much better superposition of the m15 and m92 turnoffs would be obtained if m15 has @xmath252 rather than 0.10 .",

    "( according to canonical stellar evolutionary theory , the tracks of core he - burning stars always remain brighter than the associated zahb locus at a given color . )",
    "it would therefore appear to be the case that m15 has an intrinsically bluer turnoff than m92 .",
    "( differential reddening in m15 could be partially responsible for the apparent offset in the turnoff colors , but it is unlikely to be the entire explanation ; see below . )    a difference in [ fe / h ] ( for which there is little support , anyway ) would have no more than a slight impact on the relative turnoff colors of m92 and m15 because the location of the ms on the [ @xmath254-plane has almost no dependence on metallicity at [ fe / h ] @xmath255 ( as in the case of the similar [ @xmath256-diagram ; see @xcite ) .",

    "this inconsistency is especially apparent if the zahb loci and associated evolutionary tracks are compared with the locations of the m15 rr lyrae , assuming intensity - weighted @xmath77 magnitudes and magnitude - weighted @xmath147 or @xmath132 colors for the variables .",

    "( note that the same @xmath0- and @xmath1-type variables are considered on both color planes . )",
    "part of the explanation of this discrepancy could be that @xmath147 needs a larger blueward correction than @xmath132 to represent the corresponding color of a static star , though this should not amount to more than @xmath262 mag , judging from the results for m3 by @xcite .",
    "errors in the adopted @xmath263@xmath4 transformations ( from cv14 ) could also be a contributing factor .",
    "alternatively , errors in the derived values of the mean magnitudes and/or colors may be primarily responsible for this conundrum .",

    "although helium abundance variations may provide a partial explanation , this is unlikely to be the primary explanation because the properties of the hotter first - overtone pulsators are considerably less dependent on @xmath9 than the cooler fundamental - mode pulsators .",

    "our main goal , anyway , is to try to understand why the observed values of @xmath5  are so similar for m92 and m15 , and this can be accomplished in a more robust way if the same color is used to derive the temperatures of their respective variable stars .",

    "consequently , the models for @xmath32 , 0.27 , and 0.285 are likely to fare equally well , or equally poorly , in explaining the observed periods  though one can anticipate that , due to vagaries in the data , one helium abundance might be favored over the others depending on whether the predicted period for that @xmath9 is just inside or just outside its assumed @xmath192 uncertainty .",
    "these remarks anticipate the results of our interpolations , which are presented in figure  22 .",
    "this shows that our models for _ any _ of the three values of @xmath9 that we have considered are able to reproduce the observed pulsation periods of 6 rr lyrae ( the ones represented by filled circles ) to within @xmath275  d  ( our adopted consistency criterion ) .",
    "not surprisingly , most of them are @xmath1-type variables , for which the range in the interpolated masses from the grids of hb tracks for @xmath32 , 0.27 , and 0.285 is typically @xmath276 , as compared with a range that can be as large as @xmath277 for many of the cooler @xmath0-type variables .",
    "the periods of a few other variables can be explained quite well by models for @xmath32 and 0.27 , which are identified by the superposition of open circles and crosses , while a preference for just one of the three values of @xmath9 is obtained for several other stars ( those plotted as open circles , open squares , or crosses ) .",
    "satisfactory explanations of the measured periods could not be obtained for those stars that are represented by filled triangles .",
    "there were a few variables in the initial sample for which the discrepancies between the predicted and observed periods were even larger than those obtained for any of the stars plotted in fig .",
    "they were dropped from consideration prior to performing the analysis that produced the results shown in this figure , because their removal made it much easier to achieve consistency between the predicted and observed values of @xmath5  and @xmath6 . as indicated in fig .",
    "22 , the @xmath91 adjustments that were applied to the rr lyrae temperatures to attain this consistency are all quite small .",
    "there is no reason to retain the extreme outliers in the sample anyway , as it is not possible to explain , in the context of the adopted stellar models , why the periods implied by their cmd locations would be so much larger or smaller than the observed periods ( by @xmath2780.22  d ) when reasonably good agreement is found for the majority of the variables .",
    "( the particularly problematic rr lyrae stars are the fundamental pulsators v21 , v47 , and v60 , and the first - overtone pulsators v70 and v120 .",
    "further study of these variables is clearly needed to to understand their apparently anomalous properties . )    in order to make our analysis of the m15 variables as close to a purely differential study with respect to m92 as possible , we fitted the same @xmath279 , [ fe / h ] @xmath200 , [ o / fe ] @xmath267 models that we have employed for m15 to observations of m92 . by interpolating within the corresponding grids of hb tracks , we found that the observed values of @xmath5  and @xmath6  for m92 could be reproduced if the temperatures of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-type pulsators were adjusted by @xmath280 and @xmath281 , respectively .",
    "these determinations differ by @xmath282 from the adjustments adopted in the construction of fig .",
    "10 , which is essentially identical with the plot that is obtained on the assumption of models that assume [ o / fe ] @xmath267 .",
    "small shifts in the rr lyrae @xmath4  scale that are needed to reconcile the predicted and observed values of @xmath5  and @xmath6  in m15 , on the one hand , and in m92 , on the other , are plausibly due to differences in the photometric zero - points and/or in the respective magnitude - weighted colors .",
    "although our analysis suggests that many of the rr lyrae in m15 have a higher helium abundance than those in m92 , the large number of variables in m15 provides more compelling support for the same conclusion .",
    "it is widely accepted that , as in the case of m3 ,  the bulk of the rr lyrae in m15 are in an early stage of evolution from the zahb \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the zahb that fits the nonvariable blue hb stars in m15 , which provides an equally good fit to their counterparts in m92 , is considerably fainter than the lowest - luminosity rr lyrae ( in both clusters ) . whereas the small number of variables in m92 is consistent with them being evolved stars from zahb structures well to the blue of the instability strip",
    ", the large number of variables in m15 , which have similar or greater luminosities than those residing in m92 , argues that there must be at least two distinct zahb populations in m15 .",
    "the most likely explanation for the offset in luminosity between them is a difference in the abundance of helium  a conclusion that is supported by our detailed examination of the cluster rr lyrae stars .",
    "[ the extended blue tail of m15 s hb , which contains a non - uniform distribution of stars with gaps at some magnitudes , has long been thought to indicate the presence of multiple stellar populations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "[ prior to @xmath292 , gcs were considered to be simple stellar populations in which all stars within each cluster were thought to be coeval and essentially chemically homogeneous , aside from the ubiquitous star - to - star variations in cn .",

    "equivalently , to the coefficients of @xmath86  in these equations ) , it is possible to reproduce the observed values of @xmath5  and @xmath6  quite well .",

    "consistent with the plots of the rr lyrae on various cmds ( see , e.g. , figs .  5 , 12 , and 18 ) , the magnitudes of the first - overtone pulsators in m3 have the largest standard deviations , while the luminosity dispersions of both the @xmath0- and @xmath1-type rr lyrae are the smallest in m92 . not surprisingly , the variables in m15 and m92 have brighter absolute magnitudes by @xmath298 mag than those in m3 .",
    "( as one would expect , the tabulated properties have some dependence on the samples of rr lyrae that are considered .",

    "8 , 21 ) , zahbs will be significantly fainter , implying reduced zahb - based distance moduli , if diffusion is treated .",

    ", the value of @xmath110 that we have derived for m3 using zahb models satisfies the constraint provided by current calibrations of the rr lyrae standard candle quite well . )    furthermore , the prominence of blue loops in post - zahb evolutionary tracks depends quite strongly on the helium abundance ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "this has important ramifications for the intermingling of @xmath0-type and @xmath1-type rr lyrae .",
    "for instance , as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : m3 ] , there appears to be very little overlap of the colors of these variables in m3 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , which suggests that blue loops must be small or non - existent if the _ transition _ between fundamental and first - overtone pulsation , or vice versa , depends on the direction in which the core he - burning stars are evolving through the instability strip ( the so - called  hysteresis effect \" ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and especially the very instructive plots provided by @xcite and @xcite ) ) .",
    "our diffusive models for an initial helium abundance of @xmath140 predict small blue loops ( see fig .  5 ) , though better consistency with the observations would be obtained if they were even smaller",
    ", which suggests that a slightly lower value of @xmath9 should be adopted ( but within the uncertainties of the primordial helium abundance ) or that our models underestimate the rate at which settling occurs in stars .    higher @xmath9 by @xmath307 , as predicted by non - diffusive stellar models , would result in extended blue loops , which seems incompatible with the fairly sharp boundary between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-type variables in m3 .",
    "( the age of hd140283 provides another argument that diffusion physics should not be neglected in stellar models ; see ",
    "[ subsubsec : other ] and @xcite . ) there is no overlap of the colors of these rr lyrae in m92 , nor is any expected because the evolution through the instability strip is clearly in the direction from blue to red from zahb locations on the blue side of the instability strip ( see figs .  9 , 11 , 12 ) .",
    "it is not clear what to make of the m15 variables in this regard ( see fig .",
    "21 ) , partly because the magnitude - weighted colors derived by @xcite seem particularly uncertain , and because it is not possible to unambiguously determine the helium abundances of the individual rr lyrae stars .",
    "further observational work to determine improved estimates of the colors of equivalent static stars of the m15 variables would be very helpful , as would an extension , towards lower metallicities and additional bandpasses , of the theoretical studies of @xcite on the differences between different types of averages and the static magnitudes and colors .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , a separation of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-type rr lyrae in terms of their colors is found in most gcs , irrespective of whether they are ooi or ooii systems .",
    "notable exceptions are the ooi cluster ngc3201 ( @xcite ) and the ooii clusters m15 and @xmath308  cen ( see @xcite ) .",
    "when there is a mixture of fundamental and first - overtone pulsators in a restricted color range within the instability strip , some of the variables are expected to be evolving from red to blue , and their periods should be decreasing with time , while others will be evolving in the opposite direction with positive period - change rates , @xmath309 ( see fig .  3 by @xcite ) .",
    "in principle , it should be possible to use measurements of @xmath309 to determine the directions in which individual variables are evolving . in practice",
    ", however , this seems to be very difficult .",
    "as @xcite have concluded , period - change rates in m3 appear to be due more to  noise \" than to evolutionary effects . in their follow - up of the corwin & carney study",
    ", @xcite noted that  positive and negative period - change rates with similar size are equally frequent at any period and brightness \" .",
    "for instance , v1 and v10 have comparable mean magnitudes and colors , but the values of @xmath309 tabulated for them by jurcsik et al .",
    "are @xmath310  d / myr and @xmath311  d / myr , respectively .",
    "these stars should both have increasing periods judging from their cmd locations , which are well above the zahb , relative to our evolutionary sequences .",
    "the same can be said of even brighter variables , and yet , as reported by jurcsik et al .",
    ", none of the four brightest rr lyrae in m3 have @xmath312 .",
    "this includes the brightest @xmath0-type variable in our sample , v42 , which has a period - change rate of @xmath313  d / myr . in view of such results , and the possible concerns with the mean magnitudes and colors of m15 variables mentioned above ,",
    "we have not attempted to pursue this line of investigation  though it may be worthwhile to do so when improved data become available .",
    "being able to explain the rr lyrae in m3 and m92 so well provides valuable support for our determinations of their distance moduli and ages .",
    "we find no compelling evidence for helium abundance variations in either cluster from our analysis of the variable stars , though star - to - star differences at the level of @xmath126 would be very difficult to detect .",
    "our analysis suggests that the faintest hb stars on the blue side of the instability strip and some of the rr lyrae in m15 represent an m92-like population . the fact that the difference in magnitude between these stars and the turnoff is identical to within measuring uncertainties in both clusters leads us to conclude that m15 and m92 are coeval ( as most previous studies have found ) .",
    "however , m15 appears to contain additional populations of stars with higher helium abundances , up to at least @xmath314 in the vicinity of the instability strip and possibly to higher values along the extended blue tail of the cluster hb .",
    "( fits of isochrones to the turnoff photometry on the assumption of zahb - based distance moduli suggest that m3 , m15 , and m92 all have ages of @xmath248 gyr , depending on the assumed cno abundances .",
    "it seems unlikely , in fact , that gcs are as old as the field halo subgiant hd140283  which is not implausible given the recent discovery of a galaxy at a redshift @xmath315 that seems to have built - up a stellar mass of @xmath316 within just @xmath317 myr after the big bang ; see @xcite . )",
    "our explanation of the m15 rr lyrae does raise an important question : why are the zahb stars with higher helium abundances distributed to redder colors than those for @xmath293 ? possible answers to this question are ( i ) mass loss rates vary inversely with @xmath9 , though we are unaware of any empirical or theoretical support for this suggestion , ( ii ) the abundances of the cno elements are higher in stars with increased helium abundances , ( iii ) the stars with higher @xmath9 are somewhat younger than those with normal @xmath9 , or ( iv ) some combination of these possibilities .",
    "@xcite have suggested that second generation stars would have enhanced helium and cno abundances though , in their proposed explanation of the oosterhoff dichotomy , the different generations of stars would span different color ranges .",
    "we see no evidence that this is the case ; indeed , a zahb for @xmath32 appears to provide a good fit to the faintest hb stars at all @xmath318 , where stars with higher helium are presumably also found .",
    "more importantly , there is very little spectroscopic evidence for variations in the total cno abundance in m15 .",
    "athough they studied only a few giants , @xcite found that c@xmath23n@xmath23o is constant to within the measurement uncertainties in 5 of the 6 stars in their sample .",
    "one giant apparently has much higher cno , given that the derived nitrogen abundance corresponds to [ n / fe ] @xmath319 .",
    "however , previous studies of much larger samples of upper rgb stars concluded that there are no real differences in the c and n abundances of m15 and m92 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both clusters do show a steep decline of [ c / fe ] with [ fe / h ] ( also see @xcite ) , but c  n and o ",
    "n cycling together with deep mixing ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) can explain those observations without requiring star - to - star variations in cno ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although c@xmath23n@xmath23o seems to be approximately constant , the observed variations of cn in present - day main sequence and subgiant stars , as well as star - to - star differences in mg and al at any luminosity ( e.g. , see the relevant studies of m92 and m15 by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is an entirely different issue because they can not be produced by evolutionary processes within lower mass stars .",
    "such variations must have arisen during an extended period ( or possibly successive epochs ) of star formation at early times or , if the stars currently observed within a given gc are coeval , they must have been present in the gas out of which the cluster stars formed . that the helium - enhanced stars in m15 appear to populate zahbs that extend to much redder colors than the zahb which fits the faintest stars to the blue of the instability strip suggests that the spread in stellar ages may be larger in m15 than in m92 or m3 .",
    "[ regardless of which scenario provides the most correct explanation , there is little doubt that h - burning nucleosynthesis at very high temperatures ( @xmath320  k , as predicted for supermassive stars ; see @xcite ) is responsible for the observed abundance correlations and anti - correlations , including ratios of the abundances of magnesium isotopes ( @xcite ) . ]    the potential importance of rotation for our understanding of the hbs in gcs should be kept in mind as well . in the few studies that have been undertaken during the past few decades to measure the rotation of member stars ,",
    "unexpectedly high rotational velocities have been determined for blue hb stars in the most metal - poor systems ( specifically , m92 ; see @xcite ) and in higher metallicity gcs with extremely blue hbs , including m13 ( @xcite ) and ngc288 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a spread of rotational velocities in the precursor red giants would seem to be the most probable cause of the variations in total mass along gc horizontal branches , and the average mass loss could therefore be related to the average rotational velocity in upper rgb stars .",
    "the fact that the decline of the surface carbon abundance with increasing luminosity along the giant branch is much more pronounced in m13 ( @xcite ) and most , if not all , of the extremely metal - deficient gcs ( @xcite ) than in metal - rich clusters can hardly be a coincidence . @xcite",
    "have shown that such observations can be explained by rotationally driven deep - mixing , which is expected to become less important as the metallicity increases due to the concomitant increase in the mean molecular weight gradient near the h - burning shell .",
