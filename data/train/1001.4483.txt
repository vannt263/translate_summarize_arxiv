    "the selection of central collisions is based on a minimum bias selector with a minimal dependence on the kinematical properties of detected charged particles to avoid auto - correlations . to this end",
    ", the total multiplicity of charged products has been chosen as an impact parameter selector  @xcite : the largest multiplicity being associated to the most central collisions .",
    "the stopping power is estimated by means of the isotropy ratio defined by :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the transverse kinetic energy and @xmath4 is the longitudinnal kinetic energy , the sum running over particles and fragments emitted in the forward part of the center of mass in order to minimise the role of detection theresholds . for an isotropic event ,",
    "@xmath5 is close to 1 , and is associated to fully stopped events .    figure  [ fig1]-left displays the correlation between the multiplicity and @xmath5 for xe+sn reaction at 50 amev .",
    "the evolution of the mean value of @xmath5 has been superimposed . after an increase of @xmath5 as multiplicity increases ,",
    "a saturation is observed for the largest values of the multiplicity ( i.e. most central collisions ) .",
    "this leveling off is used as a multiplicity cut to select central collisions .",
    "associated cross sections are around 50 mbarns . for such events ,",
    "the @xmath5 distribution is shown on the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a partial stopping of the projectile on the target ( i.e. @xmath6 ) is observed . the same procedure has been applied for all symmetric reactions measured with indra .",
    "xe+@xmath7sn collisions at 50 amev . left : bi - dimensional plot showing the correlation between the isotropy ratio and the total multiplicity , the red line shows the cut of the multiplicity for central collisions ( see text ) .",
    "right : corresponding @xmath5 distribution for central collisions . ]",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of the mean value of @xmath5 for central collisions as a function of the beam energy for the different studied systems .    a decrease of @xmath8 below 40 amev is observed .",
    "in such an energy range , the isotropy ratio is almost independent of the size of the system .",
    "however , as beam energy crosses the fermi energy and for heavier systems , an increase of the isotropy ratio depending on the system size is observed : the larger the size , the larger @xmath8 although for the smallest systems considered in this work , a saturation is present . in any case , low values far from unity are observed ( i.e. no full stopping ) . for a sake of comparison , we have calculated the mean value of @xmath5 in the case of free nucleons located initially in the fermi sphere of the projectile and of the target :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the relative momentum between the two fermi spheres and @xmath11 is the fermi momentum .",
    "the evolution of @xmath12 from initial conditions ( i.e. entrance channel ) as a function of the beam energy is show in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the minimum of nuclear stopping power is around 40 amev , corresponding to a smooth transition from a mean - field bahaviour to a two - body dissipation regime .",
    "in the framework of the iqmd improved by liu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , no effect of the isospin content on stopping power for sn on sn reactions in the beam energy range from 15 to 150 amev has been oberved .",
    "the indra collaboration has measured different isospin content xe+sn reactions at 32 and 45 amev .",
    "results concerning the mean value of @xmath8 are reported in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".values of @xmath8 for different xe+sn reactions at 32 and 45 amev [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     mean values of @xmath8 for a given energy are similar within systematic errors in agreement with liu s results .",
    "to go further , we have been looking at the so - called isospin difusion by exploring the evolution of isospin distribution along the beam axis using the double proton - triton  @xcite ratio expressed as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the proton - triton ratio , @xmath15 is the value of the ratio for the neutron - rich projectile neutron - rich target couple ( i.e. @xmath16xe+@xmath17sn ) and @xmath18 is the value of the ratio for the neutron - poor projectile neutron - poor target couple ( i.e. @xmath17xe+@xmath19sn ) . the ratio is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for different pairs of xe+sn isotopes at 32 amev .     along the beam axis for xe+sn at 32 amev for different isospin reactions ( for labels , see table  [ table1 ] ) . ]    for velocities larger than the projectile or smaller than the target , the proton - triton ratio is close to the projectile(target ) isospin content suggesting a strong memory effect of the entrance channel even for central collisions .",
    "as one moves towards the midvelocity region , the ratio smoothly evolves according to the isospin content of the compound system thus showing a mixing of the projectile and the target only for those particles emitted very close to mid - rapidity .",
    "such results ( together those shown in the previous section ) are proofs of a sizeable transparency of nuclear matter in the intermediate energy range . the same behaviour is also observed for 45 amev .",
    "central collisions for a large variety of systems in the intermediate energy range have been studied using indra data . charged particle kinetic energies",
    "have been used to build isotropy ratio in order to study nuclear stopping power . from 10 to 40 amev , a strong decrease of the stopping power due to the decreasing role of the mean - field",
    "is observed while for energies larger than 40 amev , an increase is evidenced due to the increasing rate of in medium nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "however , our results show that tranparency is a key feature of nuclear collisions in the intermediate energy range . at 32 and 45",
    "amev , stopping in xe+sn reactions with different isospin content do not show significative differences as observed in iqmd calculations .",
    "last , the study of isospin diffusion along the beam axis confirms nuclear transparency but also reveals isospin mixing in the midrapidity region .",
