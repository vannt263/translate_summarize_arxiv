    "dielectric relaxation in solids , a process commonly defined as an approach to equilibrium of a dipolar system driven out of equilibrium by a step or alternating external electric field , represents one of the most intensively researched topics in experimental and theoretical physics , see e.g.  [ 1 - 21 ] .",
    "wide - ranging experimental information resulting from the studies of the basic dielectric characteristics ( i.e. , the time decay of the depolarization current @xmath0 and the frequency - dependent complex dielectric permittivity @xmath1 or susceptibility @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the asymptotic value of the dielectric permittivity @xmath4 at high frequencies ) has led to the conclusion that the classical phenomenology of relaxation breaks down in complex materials .",
    "it has been found that the debye behaviour , represented by the exponentially decaying relaxation function @xmath5 yielding @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( where the constant @xmath8 denotes the loss peak frequency ) is hardly ever found in nature and that the deviations from it for many dielectrics may be relatively large @xcite .",
    "a class of systems exhibiting the non - debye relaxation patterns includes various complex materials such as supercooled liquids , amorphous semiconductors and insulators , polymers , disordered crystals , molecular solid solutions , glasses , etc .    for a long time effort",
    "was being diverted to a purely qualitative representation of the shape of the non - debye dielectric functions @xmath9 or @xmath10 in terms of certain mathematical expressions without in any way going into the physical significance of these representations .",
    "it turns out that all dielectric data are characterised well enough by a few empirical functions @xcite .",
    "the time - domain relaxation data usually are fitted by means of the stretched exponential relaxation function @xmath11 known as the kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kww ) function and coincident with the debye case ( [ d ] ) for @xmath12 .",
    "the most popular analytical expression applied to the complex susceptibility data is given by the havriliak - negami ( hn ) function @xmath13 where @xmath14 . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , formula ( [ hn ] ) takes the form known as the cole - davidson ( cd ) function ; for @xmath17 and @xmath18 it takes the form of the cole - cole ( cc ) function , and for @xmath15 and @xmath17 one obtains the classical debye form ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "we repeat that these various model functions are essentially attempts to characterise the observed behaviour without in any way indicating the physical mechanisms involved . to that extent",
    ", we note that the problem of understanding the nature of dielectric relaxation is as yet largely open since we do not have a sufficiently general method of approach to the relaxation processes . at the same time",
    "we note certain fundamental features of relaxation response which make it clear that we are faced with some very general processes into which we require a much deeper insight .",
    "the hn , cc , cd , and kww model functions all show the high - frequency limit of the response characterised by the fractional power law @xcite : @xmath19 which has the straightforward consequence of the constant ratio of the imaginary to the real components of the dielectric susceptibility @xmath20 : @xmath21 let us note that this relation implies that the ratio of energy lost per radian to the energy stored at the peak is independent of frequency .",
    "this very simple and intuitively evident property is characteristic of the prevailing universal response of most dielectric materials .",
    "we call this the `` energy criterion '' and it is neither known nor predicted by any of the accepted theories of relaxation .    important for our discussion of relaxation phenomena is the concept of residual loss @xcite which remains after the removal of such strongly frequency - dependent processes as the direct - current contribution going as @xmath22 , or low - frequency dispersion where loss is proportional to @xmath23 with @xmath24 , or dipolar loss which shows pronounced peaks .",
    "the residue left is broadly frequency - independent or only weakly dependent over extended ranges of frequency which may be approximated by the limit @xmath25 .",
    "such a limit corresponds to frequency - independent components of the dielectric susceptibility , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with their ratio tending to infinity which is impossible practically but can be seen experimentally in various approximations .",
    "figure 1 shows a compilation of data for different materials taken from much wider sets for different temperatures .",
    "these data are representative of a very wide range available in the published literature and are quoted here purely by way of examples .",
    "the data shown correspond to low or relatively low losses so that the real part of the permittivity @xmath28 does not vary by a large amount over the frequency range in question ; and it is therefore possible to normalise the data by dividing @xmath27 by the corresponding @xmath28 , thus defining the loss tangent @xmath29 , which gives absolute values of loss for the various samples while retaining the frequency dependence of @xmath27 . the essential conclusion , coming from the analysis of the data presented in figure  1 , is that the residual loss follows in some cases law ( [ fpl ] ) while in other cases it is essentially `` flat '' in frequency with minor perturbations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the addition of 17% of carbon black to polyethylene causes a rise of @xmath30 by one order of magnitude but hardly any change of the frequency dependence .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the total range of @xmath30 covers at most three decades for materials for which the direct - current conductivity varies by many orders of magnitude .",
    "it is not profitable to fit these data to any particular law since they are the result of the interplay of minor accidental factors superimposed on the prevailing broad `` flatness '' .",
    "a theoretical justification for the existence of the fractional power law of type ( [ fpl ] ) with the exponent @xmath31 arbitrarily close to unity would be sufficient for the understanding of all flat losses , any minor deviations being purely accidental .    in our theoretical approach to the analysis of the universal - response characteristics ( [ fpl ] )",
    "we make use of the concept of dipolar screening introduced by jonscher @xcite . in the framework of this concept ,",
    "the effectiveness of screening depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermally - activated - dipole density @xmath32 with an energy @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the `` critical '' density @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dipole moment of the dipole being screened .",
    "the theory of dipolar screening predicts that for low dipolar density , @xmath37 , the number of dipoles within the field of any one dipole increases almost exponentially , so that their behaviour is strongly collective and the etire system behaves in the universal manner ( [ fpl ] ) . on the other hand , for a high dipolar density , @xmath38 ,",
    "screening is effective , meaning that dipoles do not `` see '' their neighbours and behave individually in a debye - like manner .",
    "this is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the situation is in many respects similar to the classical screening by charged particles but the onset of screening is much more rapid with a fall in the dipolar density @xmath32 .    a considerable effort that has been devoted in the past to finding a theoretical explanation of the empirically observed results points on the two most widespread and at the same time least understood properties of the relaxation responses :    * the existence of the characteristic property ( [ fpl ] ) with its limiting form of virtually frequency - independent loss ; * the fact that this property of the relaxation responses is common to a very wide range of materials with very different physical and chemical interactions .    as a consequence , in theoretical attempts to model relaxation",
    "it has been commonly assumed that the empirical relaxation laws reflect a kind of general behaviour which is independent of the details of examined systems .",
    "this idea has stimulated the proposal of several relaxation mechanisms that differ mainly in the interpretation of the relaxation function . in recent attempts to find the origins of the non - debye relaxation patterns",
    "the idea of complex systems as the `` structures with variations '' @xcite that are characterised through a large diversity of elementary units and strong interactions between them is of special importance .",
    "the evolution in course of time of physical properties of a complex system is nonpredictable or anomalous @xcite , and the main feature of all the dynamical processes in such a system is their stochastic background . in the framework of statistical models ( see e.g.  [ 4 - 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 - 14 , 17 - 21 , 26 - 31 ] the fact that the large scale behaviour of complex systems shows universality , i.e. , that it is to some extent independent of the precise local nature of the considered system , should come as no surprise . intuitively , one expects `` averaging principles '' like the law of large numbers to be in force .",
    "however , it turns out to be very hard to make this intuition precise in concrete examples of stochastic systems with a large number of locally interacting components .",
    "the empirical facts stress the need for a completely novel approach to the modelling of the dielectric relaxation and , to a certain extent , also mechanical relaxation , photoconduction , photoluminescence and chemical reaction kinetics ( sharing some common features , see @xcite ) .",
    "the need to understand the connections between the macroscopic property ( [ fpl ] ) of the relaxing complex system and the statistical properties of individual molecular or dipolar species requires the introduction into the relaxation theory of advanced methods of stochastic analysis . as shown by us",
    "[ 8 , 32 - 34 ] , a general formalism of limit theorems of probability theory plays an important role in constructing tools to relate the local random characteristics of the complex system to the empirical , deterministic relaxation laws , regardless of the specific nature of the system considered .",
    "the significance of the present paper lies in the fact that no one has clarified in a simple and plausible way , let alone one based on a stochastic argument , why the universal relation should exist at all and why the residual loss is such slowly variable function of frequency .",
    "our approach provides a rigorous explanation for the most widely observed form of frequency dependence of the permittivity ( or susceptibility ) and thereby opens up a new and very powerful way of interpreting relaxation phenomena not only in the dielectric context .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to focus on the approach to relaxation in the framework proposed in @xcite as consistent with jonscher s screening and energy criterion ideas and providing their strict mathematical formulation .",
    "we also bring to light the spatio - temporal scaling conditions hidden behind all the well - known empirical responses . for the reader",
    "s convenience , the mathematical details neccessary for the stochastic construction of the effective representation of a relaxing complex system are followed by extended comments .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the basic mathematical concept underlying the stochastic transition of a complex system from its initially imposed state .",
    "we show that the relaxational properties of the entire system can be represented by means of a random effective relaxation rate which contains information on the internal stochastic structure of the investigated system . in section  3",
    "we point to the origins of the statistical properties of the effective relaxation rate .",
    "we discuss the role of limit theorems of probability theory as the mathematical technique which allows us to derive the explicit relaxation formulas even with rather restricted information on local random properties of the system .",
    "in section  4 we relate the statistical conditions yielding the well - known empirical responses to the spatio - temporal scaling properties of the relaxing complex system , and we show that they underlie jonscher s energy - criterion hypothesis .",
    "the last section contains conclusions .",
    "* ( i ) * let us consider a complex physical system containing identical objects undergoing irreversible transitions from state @xmath39 , imposed at time @xmath40 , to state @xmath41 at random instants of time .",
    "states @xmath39 and @xmath41 differ in some physical parameter , so that the transition @xmath42 is defined as the change of this particular parameter ( changes in all other parameters may also have an influence on the transition ) .",
    "let us choose one of the objects . consider the conditional probability @xmath43 that this object will undergo the transition during the time interval @xmath44 if the transition has not occured before time @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the random waiting time for the transition of the chosen object .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath43 defined in ( [ 7 ] ) can be expressed in a form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the survival probabilities , i.e. the probabilities that the considered object will remain in state @xmath39 until time @xmath51 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the survival probability of the object can be expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the waiting time distribution of the object , i.e. the total probability of its transition @xmath54 until time @xmath45 .",
    "one can rewrite the survival probability in the form @xmath55 which is dependent on a non  negative quantity @xmath56 called the intensity of transition @xcite .",
    "this quantity is time ",
    "dependent , in general ; and moreover , because of random impacts affecting each object , for different objects in the system it can take various values at the same instant of time @xcite .",
    "the survival probability @xmath50 can be derived if one knows the explicit form of the intensity @xmath56 . for the time independent intensity @xmath57 one gets @xmath58 what recovers the classical exponential evolutionary law for the object ; the value @xmath59 determines the relaxation rate of the transition process . if , on the contrary , the intensity of transition is essentially time ",
    "dependent , then the evolutionary law for the object is of the nonexponential form . in this case",
    "the resulting relaxation rate is not directly given by the intensity of transition as it is in the exponential case .",
    "in fact , taking into account the peculiarity of local random environment of an object , one should assume that , in general , the survival probability @xmath50 has the form of the weighted average of an exponential decay with respect to the probability distribution @xmath60 of the relaxation rate of the object @xmath61 in other words , the relaxation rate of the object is the random variable @xmath62 such that the total survival probability has the form @xmath63 where the mean value @xmath64 is taken with respect to the relaxation - rate probability distribution @xmath60 .",
    "expressions ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) are a generalisation of the debye relaxation for which the relaxation rate @xmath62 takes a constant value , say @xmath59 , with probability 1 , @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath62 has a degenerate probability distribution , @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 denotes the dirac delta function ) , and the integral on the right  hand side of ( [ 9 ] ) equals @xmath68 in general , in a complex system the probability distribution @xmath60 and , consequently , the survival probability @xmath50 of an object are of unknown forms .    from equation ( [ 8 ] ) the intensity of transition from an initial state , @xmath69 , is related to the total survival probability @xmath50 of the object as follows @xmath70 comparing ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) we obtain the relationship between the time ",
    "dependent intensity of transition and the relaxation rate distribution @xmath71 the above mentioned lack of information about the relaxation rate distribution @xmath60 yields that the corresponding intensity @xmath69 is of unknown form .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath69 depends on the characteristics of the random environment around the examined object and the rules needed to specify the sets of deterministic and stochastic parameters .    *",
    "( ii ) * consider ( as before ) a system of @xmath72 objects , each waiting for transition @xmath42 for some random time .",
    "for the @xmath73th object , @xmath74 , let the waiting time be denoted by @xmath75 .",
    "the notation here ( i.e.  index `` @xmath76 '' ) emphasizes the impact of the system size @xmath72 on the behaviour of each individual object that has to be taken into account . the non  negative waiting times @xmath77 form a sequence of independent , identically distributed random variables .",
    "the waiting time distribution @xmath78 is hence the same for each  @xmath73 and is equal to some function @xmath79 that may depend on @xmath72 .",
    "the objects undergo transition in a certain order that can be reflected in the notion of order statistics @xcite @xmath80 , which is simply a nondecreasing rearangement of times @xmath81 .",
    "traditionally , @xmath82 is called the @xmath83th order statistics of sample @xmath81 . note that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    for a fixed size @xmath72 of the system ,",
    "the ratio of objects not transformed up to time @xmath45 is equal to @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes an unknown ( random ! ) number of objects already transformed at time @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath89 the events @xmath90 that up to time @xmath45 exactly @xmath83 transitions occured in the system can be expressed via order statistics in the following way : @xmath91 and the probability of such events is given by the bernoulli model @xmath92^{{\\textstyle}l}\\left [ 1-p_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}in}(t)\\right ] ^{{\\textstyle}{n\\!-\\!l}},\\;l=0 , 1,\\ldots n.\\ ] ] thus the random number @xmath87 has the bernoulli ( binomial ) distribution @xmath93 with parameter @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , the fraction in ( [ 12 ] ) is a random variable .",
    "however , it follows from the strong law of large numbers @xcite that for @xmath72 large enough @xmath95 i.e. the random nature of the fraction in ( [ 12 ] ) vanishes for large @xmath72 . hence ( [ 12 ] ) is asymptotically equal to @xmath96 which is the survival probability @xmath97 of any single object : @xmath98",
    "the basic property of the relaxation function @xmath9 is its monotonic decrease from 1 at @xmath40 to 0 as @xmath99 .",
    "this is in fact a property of the survival probability and therefore ( [ 12 ] ) has been used as a definition of the relaxation function in several models . yet ( [ 12 ] ) can be used to describe the evolution of the entire system only if the behaviour of the system is represented by any individual object ( from those forming the system ) .",
    "unfortunately , this strict condition seems to contradict the idea of complexity of the investigated systems , and hence models defining the survival probability of a complex system as in ( [ 16 ] ) do not capture the nature of relaxation phenomena .",
    "moreover , the relation ( [ 15 ] ) holds for any arbitrarily chosen form of the waiting time distribution ( e.g. @xmath100 for @xmath101 , @xmath102 for @xmath103 , and @xmath104 for @xmath105 ) so that the ratio in ( [ 15 ] ) is not uniquely determined .",
    "therefore the attempts leaving the probabilistic analysis of the irreversible stochastic transitions in complex systems at this stage can only propose the form of distribution @xmath106 fitting the data most exactly , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "they do not explain the observed fractional power law ( [ fpl ] ) indicating strictly limiting properties of the survival probability of the initial state of a complex system .",
    "+ * ( iii ) * the considerations of irreversible stochastic transitions in complex systems show that the behaviour of the system as a whole , in general , can not be attributed to any chosen object forming the system @xcite . crucially relevant to this statement is the question of a proper mathematical construction of an `` averaged '' imaginary object respresenting the entire system .",
    "as it follows from ( [ 8 ] ) , the intensity of transition from an initial state for any ( real or imaginary ) object depends on its survival probability .",
    "let us denote the survival probability of an imaginary object representing the system as a whole by @xmath107 and by @xmath108 the effective waiting time for the entire system .",
    "since the considered imaginary object represents the whole system , the survival probability @xmath107 is the probability that the transition of the system as a whole from its initial state ( imposed by external constraints at @xmath40 ) has not happened prior to a time instant  @xmath45 .",
    "this mathematical quantity is defined as the probability that there is no transition occuring in the system up to time @xmath45 so that @xmath109 by means of the bernoulli scheme ( [ 14 ] ) with @xmath110 , the survival probability of the system is the product of @xmath72 factors , each asymptotically equal to ( [ 12 ] ) , see equation ( [ 16 ] ) : @xmath111 on the other hand , by means of the order statistics @xmath112 , see equation ( [ 13 ] ) ; and the survival probability of the entire system @xmath113 is just the probability that the first passage of the system from the initial state has not happened before time  @xmath45 .    since the waiting times @xmath114 are independent and identically distributed , we have @xmath115 assuming ( [ 10 ] ) for each @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 where random variables @xmath118 are also independent and identically distributed , we obtain that the survival probability of the system is of the form analogous to ( [ 10 ] ) : @xmath119 where @xmath120 the random variable @xmath121 can be considered as the effective relaxation rate representing the entire system ; and , in accordance with the rate - theory concept ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , individual relaxation rates @xmath122 s are hence some contributions to the total rate @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , in any complex dielectric system under a weak external electric field only a part of the total number @xmath72 of dipoles , referred to as `` active '' dipoles , is directly governed by changes of the field .",
    "the exact number of such dipoles depends on temperature , density of the dipolar species in the system , and interactions between them , and it is usually unknown .",
    "( in some cases it may take the value of the total number of the dipoles in the system . )",
    "therefore , there can be only a part of dipoles contributing to the effective relaxation rate , and it is reasonable to modify formula ( [ 18 ] ) taking some unknown number @xmath123 instead of exactly @xmath72 components : @xmath124",
    "the relaxation function @xmath9 , which is the probability that the initially imposed state of a macroscopic system survives by time @xmath45 , is well known to be expressed as the weighted average of an exponential decay with respect to the distribution of the effective relaxation rate @xmath121 @xcite , and its explicit form depends on statistical properties of the rate . in view of (",
    "[ 17 ] ) , we can use the survival probability @xmath125 as a definition of the relaxation function and we obtain in this case that @xmath126 where @xmath121 is given by ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath123 , the number of components in ( [ 19 ] ) , which is in agreement with the nature of the relaxation phenomenon , has been presented in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the following idea :    depending on the strength of screening , the active dipoles in the complex system may `` see '' each other to some extent .",
    "the collective behaviour of active dipoles results in the appearance of mesoscopic cooperative regions contributing to the macroscopic relaxation process @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath127 of such mesoscopic regions in the system is determined by their sizes @xmath128 and by the number of the active dipoles in the system @xcite .",
    "the effective relaxation rate @xmath121 consists of the contributions @xmath129 of all @xmath127 mesoscopic cooperative regions @xmath130 similarily , the relaxation rate @xmath129 of the @xmath131th mesoscopic region is the sum of the contributions @xmath122 of all active dipoles over the region [ 13 , 32 - 34 ] and hence it is equal to @xmath132 as mentioned in section 2 ( i ) , the individual relaxation rate , denoted here by @xmath122 , reflects the random intra - cluster dynamics , i.e. statistical properties of the interactions of the @xmath73th active dipole with some inactive neighbours forming around it a cluster of size @xmath133 .    comparing ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) with @xmath129 of the form ( [ 22 ] ) one obtains the explicit formula for @xmath123 , the number of the contributions to the total relaxation rate , in the framework of the proposed approach . for the sake of this paper",
    "it is not neccessary to cite the entire complicated formula derived ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "it is only important to note that @xmath123 is fully determined by @xmath72 , the system size ; by the cluster sizes @xmath134 ; and by the cooperative - region sizes @xmath135 .",
    "the number of the dipoles directly engaged in the relaxation process , their location , interaction range , relaxation rates , and all the quantities defined by them are random .",
    "their precise stochastic characteristics determining the relaxation response of the system are unknown , unfortunately . however , as a rule , the relaxing systems consist of a large number of dipoles so that the distribution of @xmath121 can be satisfactorily approximated by the weak limit @xmath136 in practice , even @xmath137 can suffice to replace adequately @xmath121 in ( [ 20 ] ) by the limit @xmath138 .    on the basis of the limit theorems of probability theory the distribution of the effective relaxation rate @xmath138 in ( [ 23 ] ) and the resulting form of the relaxation response ( [ 20 ] ) in time or the corresponding susceptibility in frequency domain @xmath139 can be derived even with rather restricted information on properties of the micro / mesoscopic statistical levels in the system .",
    "it appears @xcite that each of the well - known dielectric responses can be obtained in this way if appropriate conditions are imposed on the basic random quantities : the cluster sizes @xmath133 , the sizes @xmath140 of the cooperative regions of correlated clusters , and the individual active - dipole relaxation rates @xmath122 .",
    "table 2 collects the statistical properties shown @xcite to underlie the kww , hn , cc , cd , and debye relaxation responses , given by formulas ( [ kww ] ) and ( [ hn ] ) . as it follows from the table ,",
    "the empirical responses are realized by various stochastic schemes .",
    "the conditions imposed on @xmath133 , @xmath140 , and @xmath122 here take one of two forms ; either the distribution of the quantity considered is of finite mean value or it has a heavy tail .",
    "let us explain that the distribution of a nonnegative random variable , say @xmath141 , has a heavy tail if for some @xmath142 the tail function @xmath143 for large @xmath144 , i.e. , @xmath145 classical example of the heavy - tailed distribution is the pareto distribution @xcite @xmath146 with the shape parameter @xmath147 and any positive scale constant @xmath39 .",
    "( in this case the heavy - tail exponent @xmath148 . )",
    "another distribution possesing this property is a generalisation of the pareto example ; namely , the burr law @xcite @xmath149 with the shape parameters @xmath150 such that @xmath151 and any positive scale constant  @xmath39 .",
    "( here the heavy - tail exponent @xmath152 . ) more difficult but interesting heavy - tailed distributions are the completely asymmetric lvy - stable laws @xcite defined by their laplace transforms @xmath153 with @xmath147 and @xmath154 .",
    "( in this case the heavy - tail exponent @xmath148 . )",
    "condition ( [ ht ] ) applied to any random variable @xmath141 expresses the following scaling property of the magnitude represented by @xmath141 : @xmath155 for any fixed constant @xmath156 .",
    "( if there exists the corresponding probability density @xmath157 , the condition ( [ 25 ] ) yields @xmath158 for large @xmath144 . )",
    "hence , in the presented approach the heavy - tail property is directly related to the spatial ( if referred to @xmath133 and @xmath140 , the cluster and the cooperative - region sizes ) or temporal ( if referred to the relaxation rate @xmath122 ) scaling properties of the system . comparing the non - debye responses with the debye one , as done in table  3",
    ", one can see that the difference between them lies in the presence of such a scaling in the system .",
    "namely , in the debye case , that of the individual behaviour of the active dipoles , there is no property of this form .",
    "by contrast , spatial or / and temporal scaling can be found for other responses .",
    "moreover , at least one of the two variates @xmath140 and @xmath122 has a heavy - tailed distribution in the non - debye cases .",
    "since , as equation ( [ 22 ] ) shows , the correlated - cluster relaxation rate @xmath129 includes both those quantities ; its distribution has also a heavy tail , `` producing '' a hierarchy of mesoscopic relaxation rates ; i.e. the same proportion of smaller or larger mesoscopic contributions to the effective response no matter the scale at which one is looking at the relaxation rate distribution .",
    "this property follows from both the stochastic properties of the active dipoles generated by the intra - cluster dynamics and the strength of screening yielding the range of interactions between them .    as a consequence of the proposed approach ,",
    "the origins of the macroscopic energy criterion coefficient can be pointed out .",
    "as we have already explained , the heavy - tailed distribution of any ( micro / meso / macroscopic ) relaxation rate @xmath62 reflects the scaling property of the rate @xmath159 for any fixed constant @xmath156 ( where @xmath160 is the heavy - tail exponent ) . as in ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) , we have @xmath161 so that the properties of the micro / meso / macroscopic relaxation rates determine the survival probabilities of the microscopic ( active dipole ) , mesoscopic ( cooperative region ) , and macroscopic ( entire system ) objects , respectively ; thus , by analogy to ( [ 20 ] ) , defining the function @xmath162 , for simplicity referred to as the micro / meso / macroscopic relaxation function .    the asymptotic behavior ( [ 26 ] ) of the relaxation - rate distribution at large @xmath163",
    "is connected with the short - time behavior of the associated relaxation function @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "namely , at the origin @xmath165 the response function @xmath166 takes the form @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a function slowly varying at @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath169 as @xmath165 for any fixed positive constant @xmath170 ) .",
    "then , it can be shown @xcite that the short  time property ( [ 27 ] ) of the response function @xmath171 corresponds to the following asymptotic behavior of @xmath172 for the high - frequency region : @xmath173 property ( [ 28 ] ) leads straightforwardly to the constant ratio @xmath174 with @xmath175 .",
    "this result , interpreted as the ( micro / meso / macroscopic ) energy criterion , is consistent with the energy criterion ( [ encr ] ) if only @xmath176 is equal to the macroscopic high - frequency power - law exponent @xmath31 .",
    "summing up , the heavy - tail property of the relaxation rate with the heavy - tail exponent @xmath160 leads to the energy criterion with the characteristic constant @xmath177 .",
    "table  4 contains the detailed discussion of the energy criterion at the micro / meso/ macroscopic levels for the cases related to the kww , hn , cc and cd empirical relaxation responses ( [ kww ] ) and ( [ hn ] ) .",
    "observe that in each particular response the parameter @xmath176 followed from the mesoscopic - relaxation - rate tail is equal to the macroscopic energy - criterion coefficient @xmath31 , and hence , that the high - frequency universal laws ( [ fpl ] ) and ( [ encr ] ) and its parameter @xmath31 are determined by the heavy - tail properties of the mesoscopic ( correlated - cluster ) relaxation rate distributions .",
    "the above proves jonscher s hypothesis introduced in his screening theory of relaxation and stating that in order to observe property ( [ encr ] ) at the macroscopic level , the same property must characterise the behaviour of the relaxing dipoles . as shown in table  4 , in general , the energy - criterion parameter agrees with @xmath31 from equation ( [ encr ] ) on the mesoscopic level , only .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first attempt to relate rigorously the widely observed universal macroscopic laws to the micro / mesoscopic statistical characteristics of the complex system , thereby establishing a basis for the understanding of the stochastic origins of the relaxation phenomenon .",
    "the essential element which was required for the derivation of these results is the strict probabilistic formalism in terms of which the dipolar screening and energy criterion concepts can be expressed .      1 .   at the microscopic level",
    ", a random number of the active dipoles , those that follow changes of the external field , is selected ; their individual relaxation rates are determined by the interactions of the active dipoles with inactive neighbours forming random - sized clusters around them ; 2 .   at the mesoscopic level ,",
    "correlated - cluster regions of sizes depending on the strength of screening appear ; the collective rate of relaxation of the active dipoles in such a mesoscopic cooperative region becomes correlated with the number of the active dipoles in the region and with the stochastic properties of their individual relaxation rates , see equation ( [ 22 ] ) ; the mesoscopic correlated - cluster relaxation rate combines both the spatial and the temporal scaling properties of the system ; 3 .   at the macroscopic level ,",
    "averaging over the number of effective contributions and their rates leads to the universal relaxation for the entire system , giving law ( [ fpl ] ) ; the sufficient condition of this is that the high - frequency energy criterion is satisfied at the mesoscopic level ; the mesoscopic energy criterion is provided by the heavy - tail property of the correlated - cluster relaxation rates .",
