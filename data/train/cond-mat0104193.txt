    "this fluctuation regime gives rise to various unusual phenomena,@xcite such as an anomalous temperature dependence of the knight shift , nmr relaxation rate and electrical conductivity , an anomalous frequency dependence of infrared conductivity , as well as the formation of a pseudogap in the electronic density of states .",
    "close to @xmath0 it also allows to see true critical behaviour in quantities such as the specific heat @xcite or thermal expansion.@xcite + in the present work , we specifically address the temperature and field dependence of the diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath1 of strongly anisotropic high temperature superconductors above @xmath0 .",
    "the influence of fluctuations on @xmath1 has been studied long ago in the framework of a landau - ginzburg model , taking into account gaussian fluctuations of the order parameter above the critical temperature.@xcite more refined calculations based on the lawrence - doniach model have taken into account the lattice structure.@xcite recent measurements @xcite have shown that the gaussian approximation can indeed well describe the diamagnetic fluctuations in optimally doped ybco , whereas underdoped specimens of the same compound , such as yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , show dramatic deviations from this behaviour .",
    "the fluctuation region where the zero - field orbital susceptibility shows appreciable values extends over a much larger temperature range than in the optimally doped system .",
    "moreover , the field dependence of the magnetization shows a much more pronounced crossover between low and high fields than what would have been expected from gaussian fluctuations .",
    "+ we base our calculations on an anisotropic lawrence - doniach ( ld ) functional , involving the superconducting order parameter field @xmath5 in the presence of a vector potential that describes a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice planes . rather than considering gaussian fluctuations , we assume a `` precursor regime '' in which the amplitude of @xmath5 has already acquired a non - zero average value whereas its phase is subject to strong fluctuations inhibiting long range superconducting order . in this context the ld - functional reduces to an anisotropic layered xy - model .",
    "the relevant thermal excitations of such a system are the phase field singularities which manifest themselves as vortices and antivortices in 2d and as vortex loops in 3d .",
    "the applied magnetic field also acts on the phases by inducing vortex lines crossing the sample from one end to the other .",
    "the diamagnetic susceptibility , expressed in the usual way by a current - current correlation function , is then related to the positional correlation function of the vortex line elements , the static structure factor @xmath6 .",
    "we model @xmath6 in a simple way by using various known results obtained either by analytic considerations based on the coulomb gas analogy or by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the anisotropic 3d xy - model",
    ". then we arrive at explicit expressions for the zero - field susceptibility @xmath7 and the temperature and field dependent magnetization @xmath8 .",
    "they contain several material dependent parameters which are estimated by comparing with the experimental data on underdoped ybacuo from ref.6 .",
    "+ this procedure unravels three main features .",
    "first , the density of the vortex line elements contributing to the diamagnetic response ( those which are oriented in @xmath9-direction , i.e. , parallel to the applied field ) is thermally activated with a value of the activation energy that is compatible with what is found in the above mentioned mc simulations .",
    "second , in the temperature range covered by the experiments , the value of the anisotropy shows that the positions of the vortex line elements fluctuate strongly from one layer to the other .",
    "this points to a rather weak effective coupling between layers , which is compatible with the fact of being above the vortex melting , respectively the `` vortex decoupling '' line .",
    "finally the rather sharp crossover of the magnetization @xmath8 as a function of @xmath10 points to a subtle interplay between thermally excited vortex loops and field induced vortex lines .",
    "+ these observations allow for the following conclusions : _ ( i ) _ the experiments in ref.6 can be much better accounted for by phase excitations than by gaussian fluctuations of the pairing field .",
    "this is particularly manifest in the activated @xmath11-dependence of the susceptibility , but also in the existence of two field regimes with quite different behaviours of the magnetization . in this context",
    "we have , however , to admit that the very sharp crossover between these two regimes observed in the experiment may also be due to sample inhomogeneities as it was suggested in the experimental papers.@xcite _ ( ii ) _ except for the data taken close to the zero - field critical temperature , the diamagnetic response of the underdoped compound presented in ref.6 seems to be `` precritical '' , in the sense that the relevant lengths in the lattice planes as well as in the perpendicular direction do not show any true critical ( i.e. , singular ) behaviour ( which would be supposed to belong to the 3d xy universality class @xcite ) .",
    "+ in section ii we develop the theoretical formalism that allows to express @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of the vortex line structure factor , and in section iii we compare our theoretical results with the data presented in ref.6 for underdoped ybco , thereby extracting the free parameters from the experimental curves . a summary is presented in section iv .",
    "we discuss the orbital magnetic response of an underdoped superconductor in the london approximation to the lawrence - doniach ( ld ) model , i.e. , in the framework of an 3d anisotropic layered xy - model in which the phase @xmath12 of the superconducting order parameter @xmath5 is coupled to the vector potential @xmath13 describing a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath14 perpendicular to the lattice planes ( we restrict ourselves to temperatures @xmath15 where the meissner effect is absent , identifying thus the external and the effective internal vector potential ) : @xmath16=\\frac{1}{2a^2d}\\sum_n\\int { d}^2\\!r\\ ,   \\{j_{\\parallel}a^2 [ { \\boldsymbol\\nabla}_{\\!\\parallel}\\theta_n -\\frac{2\\pi}{\\phi_0}{\\mathbf a}_{\\parallel}]^2 + j_{\\!\\perp } [ 1-\\cos(\\theta_n-\\theta_{n+1})]\\}. \\label{xyaction}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the lattice constant in the planes whereas @xmath18 denotes the distance between two layers . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the respective phase couplings .",

    "moreover , these materials exhibit a layered structure which is specifically taken into account by the lawrence - doniach approach . expression ( [ xyaction ] ) is a partial continuum version of the discrete 3d xy - model , the josephson coupling @xmath24 between neighbouring lattice sites in a given layer having been replaced by the phase gradient .",

    "although the 3d xy - system shows a `` normal '' second order transition , even when it is anisotropic , it has been shown that it is also possible to understand the critical behaviour of such a system in terms of vortex excitations , which - for topological reasons - now have to form closed loops or continuous lines crossing the whole system.@xcite the loops are the 3d extension of the planar vortex and antivortex structure whereas the lines arise from the presence of an external magnetic flux penetrating into the sample in the same way as in a type ii superconductor below @xmath0 . in the following we will use this vortex picture of the 3d xy - model in order to calculate the phase correlation function @xmath41 that determines the diamagnetic response according to eq.([diamresp ] ) .",
    "+ since vortex lines are either closed ( forming a loop ) or extend continuously through the whole sample , we can characterize their structure by labelling each line by an index @xmath42 and by giving its position @xmath43 in a given layer @xmath44 which corresponds to the centre of the corresponding `` pancake vortex '' ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",

    "the susceptibility data of ref.6 , for a very low applied field of 0.02 t , cover the range from @xmath11 = 63k , which is just above the zero - field transition temperature , to @xmath11 = 110k . above @xmath11",

    "most of the thermal loops existing up to the critical temperature consist of elements parallel to the lattice planes.@xcite loop segments perpendicular to the planes only begin to be formed above @xmath0 .",

    "such loops contain at least two line segments perpendicular to the planes , the rest being between two planes .",
    "this 3d structure may explain the relatively large value of the activation energy @xmath109 found above .",
    "the latter is also compatible with an explicit expression for the loop self - energy proposed in ref.7 assuming that the total length of the loop segments oriented in @xmath9-direction is on the order of two interplanar distances , the rest of the loop being oriented parallel to the lattice planes .",

    "these quantities , which must be compatible to another , are estimated by comparing @xmath143 and @xmath8 to experimental data obtained on underdoped ybco @xciteand allow then to deduce an accurate picture of the phase system of such materials . +",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows : + _ ( i ) _ there have been attempts to understand the same data based on gaussian fluctuations of the anisotropic ld - model.@xcite the corresponding fit for optimally doped ybco , where the precursor region is much narrower , has worked out successfully . however , the discrepancies between experiment and the corresponding theoretical curves for the underdoped compound are very large , both in the temperature and magnetic field dependences .",
    "our approach , based on topological phase excitations in a non critical regime , is much more satisfactory . + _",
    "( ii ) _ the experimental low - field susceptibility has an activated temperature behaviour .",
    "this observation indeed points to excitations which have a finite creation energy ( the vortex loops ) , rather than some wave - like fluctuations of the pairing field ( the gaussian modes ) .",
    "the value of the activation energy is roughly 20 times the critical temperature , what shows that the relevant vortex loops extend over several layers .",
    "the density of those loops is relatively small , indicating that , close to the critical temperature , the phase system consists predominantly of vortex loops running essentially parallel to the planes , and the line elements in @xmath9-direction which contribute to @xmath1 only develop significantly above the critical temperature .",
    "+ _ ( iii ) _ the interlayer current correlations reflecting the geometrical structure of vortex loops in the @xmath9-direction are taken into account in terms of an effective correlation length @xmath144 .",
    "the value of the latter has been determined by the vortex loop activation energy .",
    "in the temperature range of the measurements it is small , typically 2 or 3 interlayer distances . this feature can be also characterized by the stiffness of the vortex line which is found to be approximately inversely proportional to the anisotropy parameter .",
    "these observations indicate that the observed phase structure corresponds very well to the picture of weakly coupled layers of two - dimensional `` pancakes '' vortices . + _",
    "( iv ) _ in the calculation of the molar susceptibility we have multiplied the molar volume by an overall prefactor called `` effective active volume fraction '' taking into account only those parts of the unit cell that contribute to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "this quantity was found to be of the order of 10 - 20 percents . + _ ( v ) _ both the activated behaviour of @xmath1 and the small value of the above correlation length @xmath144 point to the fact that the measurements of ref.6 cover a `` precritical '' regime .",
    "indeed , although the relevant physics is governed by phase fluctuations according to our assumptions , no divergence of the 3d xy - type has been observed .",
    "the latter is nevertheless expected for the data taken the closest to @xmath0 , as it has been identified in ref.8 for layered superconductors with a reasonable value of the anisotropy . in fact one observes that some deviations from the activated behaviour appear for the temperatures the closest to @xmath0 .",
    "this may indicate a crossover to a critical regime in which the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath1 is no more simply governed by the _ total _ vortex density , but by a diverging correlation length @xmath145 associated with the _ free _ vortex density which should be used instead of @xmath64 in the structure factor ( [ coulomb ] ) and in @xmath1 [ eq.([suscept ] ) ] , as it was done in the 2d case for calculating the zero field susceptibility.@xcite moreover , in this case the dimensionless quantity @xmath9 defined in eq.([scaling ] ) becomes the scaling variable @xmath146 which has been used extensively to study critical properties under magnetic field.@xcite + _ ( vi ) _ the experimental data show an extremely sharp crossover in the field dependence of the magnetization . within our approach this",
    "is attributed to a subtle interplay between the two types of vortices suggesting that the presence of field - induced vortex lines is favoring the creation of thermal vortex loops containing at least two segments along the @xmath9-direction . however , even our most refined theoretical curves are still more smooth than the data .",
    "it is therefore not excluded that the observed behaviour may have yet another origin than superconducting fluctuations , for instanced sample inhomogeneities , as it has been suggested and observed in other samples by the authors of the experimental work @xcite that we have analysed .",
