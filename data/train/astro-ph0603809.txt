    "superbubbles ( sbs ) are some of the most dramatic examples of the interaction between hot stars and the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "they usually appear as limb - brightened rings @xmath7 pc in diameter in optical emission lines , often surrounding stellar ob associations .",
    "the combined stellar winds of the most massive association members excavate a bubble in the surrounding ism and form a characteristic shell - like structure .",
    "these bubbles are further heated and energized as the most massive association members reach the end of their lives and explode as supernovae ( sn ) .",
    "the coronal gas in the centers of sbs often appears bright in soft x - rays while the outer shell is bright in optical emission lines .",
    "however , little is known observationally about the interface between the hot interior and the cool shell .",
    "measuring the hot gas content of sbs will help constrain the hot gas production in the ism , disk - halo feedback mechanisms , as well as refine the models of the life - cycle of sbs .",
    "the advent of the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) satellite has made it possible to observe the  resonance doublet ( @xmath8 ) , which is a sensitive probe of @xmath9  k gas . since o@xmath10 has an ionization potential of 114 ev , photoionized  is negligible in most ism contexts .",
    "moderate - velocity shocks , however , can produce  ( @xmath11 km  s@xmath12 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "gas in the @xmath13  k phase can also be formed at the interface between hot , coronal gas ( @xmath14 k ) and cooler material through thermal conduction @xcite and turbulent mixing layers @xcite .",
    "the magellanic clouds contain a number of classic examples of sbs .",
    "however , nearly every sight line toward the magellanic clouds shows  absorption at both galactic and magellanic velocities @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite measured the large magellanic cloud ( lmc )  absorption in the spectra of twelve carefully - chosen stars and found that @xmath4  has very little correlation with warm - disk ism morphology as traced by h@xmath5  or soft x - ray brightness .",
    "secondly , there are variations in @xmath4  column density by a factor of four or more between sight lines and these variations occur over relatively small angular scales .",
    "the  absorption profiles show little relationship to tracers of cooler ions and are usually centered at approximately @xmath15 km  s@xmath12  in relation to warm - disk probes such as .",
    "furthermore , the  profiles are all much broader than can be accounted for by simple thermal broadening , implying that they sample multiple hot gas systems or turbulent absorbers along each line of sight .",
    "these results are generally consistent with the idea that the observed  at lmc velocities is due primarily to a halo of hot gas surrounding the lmc and expanding toward us up to several 10s of km  s@xmath12 .",

    "we obtained _ fuse _",

    "the _ fuse _  instrument covers a spectral range of @xmath26   ( including the  doublet ) at a resolution of @xmath27 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "further details about the instrument and on - orbit performance can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the n70 targets are all of spectral type o9 or earlier and have well - characterized continua in the spectral region near the  @xmath01032 line .",

    "the _ fuse _  targets are indicated in figure  1 and the observational specifics are listed in table  1 .",
    "we gauge the  contribution from the lmc halo in the direction of n70 by selecting a group of nearby comparison sight lines from archival _ fuse _  data .",
    "though _ fuse _  has observed over 100 early - type stars in the lmc @xcite , we require specific attributes for optimal comparison targets .",
    "proximity to n70 is the first requirement since we wish to probe a similar sight line through the lmc halo material ; we limit our search to observations within 60  of n70 .",
    "furthermore , we wish to avoid contamination from possible local sources of hot gas and thus disqualify targets toward  regions , other sbs , supergiant shells , and snrs . finally we need an unambiguous stellar continuum around 1032  and thus rule out stars of type b0 and later .",
    "we found three o - type stars observed by _ fuse _",
    "that match these criteria .",
    "in addition , we included cal83 ( rxj0543.6 - 6822 ) , a cataclysmic variable / x - ray binary target located in a the low - emission field south of n70 .",
    "this target is fainter , but the continuum is well - defined and acceptable for use as a comparison .",
    "figure  2 shows that our comparison stars are located on three sides of n70 .",
    "thus , any large - scale trends in  column density across the region should be averaged out to first order .",
    "we also list the observational parameters for these comparison targets in table  1 .",
    "each of the eight data sets was reduced with calfuse v2.0.5 or higher , aligned , and coadded by exposure .",
    "our analysis is based on lif1 data since this channel has the highest sensitivity .",
    "the exception is cal83 , for which we aligned and coadded the lif1a and lif2b channels , resulting in an increased s / n for this faint source ( at the cost of a slight decrease in spectral resolution ) .",
    "absorption lines tend to be broad ( @xmath29 km  s@xmath12 ) compared to the instrumental profile ( @xmath30 km  s@xmath12 ) so this slight decrease in resolution is acceptable .",
    "we converted observed heliocentric velocities to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) with a uniform correction of @xmath31 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the wavelength scale of each sight line was then calibrated such that the strongest component of the narrow  @xmath01020.70 line was at @xmath32 km  s@xmath12 , an adjustment of much less than a 20 km  s@xmath12  resolution element in all cases .",
    "data from the lif1b segment were aligned with the lif1a segment by cross - correlating  @xmath01144.94 absorption with  @xmath01020.70 .",
    "again , this involved a shift of less than a resolution element in all cases .    absorption - free regions of stellar continuum within a few angstroms of 1032   were used to normalize the spectra with low - order legendre polynomials .",

    "this is consistent with either a halo that corotates with the lmc disk , or a vertical outflow of hot gas from the disk at @xmath217 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath214 km  s@xmath12  expansion velocity of n70 makes sb  absorption kinematically indistinguishable from typical halo  absorption . comparing absolute component velocities to better than @xmath218 km",
    "s@xmath12  is difficult with _ fuse",
    "_  data , but we note that the  centroid velocity of @xmath219 km  s@xmath12  is somewhat lower than the 254 km  s@xmath12  component assumed to represent the expanding shell .",
    "this is also @xmath220 km  s@xmath12  from the assumed systemic velocity .",
    "the comparison sight lines show @xmath221 km  s@xmath12 .    there is a significant variability in @xmath4  between different lmc sight lines @xcite . however , this is the first study to examine closely spaced sight lines through a single ism structure in the lmc .",
    "three of the four n70 sight lines show @xmath4  consistent within their error bars in both the aod and voigt fitting methods .",
    "the exception ( sk@xmath222 ) shows noticeably stronger absorption .",
    "the uniformity of the three sight lines over @xmath223  ( @xmath224 pc at the distance of the lmc ) suggests that  is distributed evenly throughout n70 on roughly this scale .",
    "however , the sk@xmath222 sight line is located only 16  ( @xmath166 pc ) from the lh114 - 7 sight line and shows an excess  column of @xmath225 dex .",
    "this angular scale is similar to that of h@xmath5  filaments seen at the edges of n70 and the column density difference may indicate that  is distributed nonuniformly on about the same scale .",
    "we now discuss the possible origins of the observed @xmath226  @xmath3 excess column in n70 .",
    "four possibilities include photoionization , shock heating , turbulent mixing at the interface between the hot interior and the cold shell , or thermal conduction .",
    "photoionization of o@xmath227 requires a harder spectrum ( photons of @xmath228 ev ) than even the hottest o stars can produce .",
    "is often attributed to shocks , and indeed observed snr column densities are consistent with the n70 observations ( @xmath229  @xmath3 toward snr0057 - 7226 , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , @xcite infer @xmath230 km  s@xmath12  based on optical emission line ratios across the face of n70 .",
    "although this is high for the expansion velocity of a sb , it is far too slow to produce any significant amount of . furthermore , our sight lines intersect the sb shell nearly perpendicular to the presumed direction of expansion , yet we see  absorption near the systemic velocity , inconsistent with a shock front fast enough to produce .",
    "turbulent mixing layers involve a hot , low - density phase and a warm , high - density phase with a relative motion between them .",
    "cooler material is entrained and heated by the hot flow in turbulence at all scales and ovi and related ions may be generated . given the known expansion of n70 and the convoluted morphology of the optical shell , such relative motions are plausible .",
    "however , current simulations predict very low column densities ( @xmath231 @xmath3 ) per interface over physical scales of a few parsecs @xcite .",
    "while multiple turbulent mixing layers may explain the observed  in the halo , there is not enough room for sufficient interfaces within a structure as small as n70 .",
    "thermal conduction models seem to provide the best explanation for the observed @xmath4 , but still have difficulty producing sufficient column density .",
    "in this mechanism , a hot , low - density phase ( @xmath232  k ) is in contact with a cooler , high - density phase .",
    "energy from the hot gas propagates into the cooler material as an evaporation front . when a significant amount of material reaches @xmath233  k , radiative cooling becomes dominant and the evaporation front stalls .",
    "a condensation front then propagates back into the hot side .",
    "@xcite model a plane - parallel conduction interface and with  present in both evaporation and condensation fronts with a column density @xmath234 @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite model a wind - blown bubble with a conductive interface between the hot , shocked stellar wind and the cool , swept - up ism and find @xmath235 @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite calculate @xmath236 @xmath3 for old snrs , depending on a number of parameters .",
    "more recent models of old cooling bubbles come close to @xmath237 @xmath3 ( j. d. slavin , priv .",
    "comm . ) , but can not quite explain the observed  excess in n70 .",
    "it is also unclear if there has been sufficient time in the evolution of n70 for conductive interfaces to generate their maximum potential @xmath4 .    with the complexity of the nebular structure of n70",
    "as seen in h@xmath5 , we could invoke multiple interfaces to bring the total @xmath4  up to the observed values .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that either all four sight lines pierce the same number of strong interfaces ( such as conductive interfaces ) , or that there is enough volume inside n70 for a statistically large number of weak interfaces ( such as turbulent mixing layers ) .",
    "we conclude that a single thermal conduction interface is the most likely source of the observed hot gas , although some combination of these options is also possible .",
    "observations of other li - like ions ( , , ) would be of great help in differentiating heating scenarios @xcite , although no instrument is currently available to make the needed observations .",
    "photoionization will likely also play a role in the production of these lower ions , but many of the critical parameters ( spectral type of the photoionizing stars , gas density , etc ) are already well - constrained making the modelling relatively benign .    as a further reality check",
    ", we estimate the total hydrogen density associated with the  implied by our measurements . assuming that the  is distributed in a shell of thickness @xmath238",
    ", then @xmath239 assuming an  fractional ion abundance @xmath240 and a typical lmc  region abundance @xmath241 @xcite , we derive @xmath242 .",
    "for an  shell occupying the outer 10% of the sb radius ( @xmath243  pc ) , we get @xmath244 .",
    "this value is nicely intermediate between the inferred densities of the photoionized shell ( @xmath245 , * ? ? ? * ) and the hot bubble interior ( @xmath246 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as one would expect from a thermal conduction interface .",
    "in addition to the  absorption seen toward the stellar targets , we can search for  emission from n70 .",
    "the four n70 sight lines are in a crowded stellar field and were observed with the 4@xmath24720  _ fuse _  mdrs aperture .",
    "the 30@xmath24730lwrs aperture is positioned 208  away ( 52 pc at the distance of the lmc ) from the mdrs aperture at a position angle determined by the _ fuse _  spacecraft roll angle at the time of each observation .",
    "lwrs aperture placements can potentially constrain  emission and , in conjunction with column densities measured in absorption , determine the gas density @xmath248 . in a lwrs aperture placed serendipitously on the edge of smc snr0057@xmath167226 in an exposure of only 11 ksec . ] unfortunately , the lwrs aperture locations for all four n70 pointings fall just outside the bright h@xmath5  limb of the sb as shown by the dotted boxes in figure  1 . hence",
    ", we instead use these observations to place an upper limit on any general diffuse  emission in the region near n70 .",
    "none of the individual lwrs pointings show emission in either of the  doublet lines at either galactic or lmc velocities . coadding the four lif1a data sets to increase the s / n",
    ", we have a total of 41.7 ks of exposure time .",
    "the coadded data show no evidence for  emission and we set a @xmath249 upper limit for diffuse  emission of @xmath250 or @xmath251 .",
    "this upper limit is not as sensitive as the @xmath249 limit on diffuse  emission in the local bubble of @xmath252 @xcite but is @xmath253 times lower than the  emission found by @xcite on the limb of snr0057 - 7226 .",
    "a lwrs aperture placed within the ring of n70 could potentially show high - ion line emission and would be a definitive test for sb .",
    "finally , we note that the composite n70 and comparison profiles do nt match perfectly in figure  4 in the galactic component .",
    "the n70 profile shows a slight excess in absorption at @xmath254 km  s@xmath12  while the profiles at @xmath255 km  s@xmath12  match quite well .",
    "this excess is nominally in the galactic absorption component but could plausibly represent hot material escaping from n70 with a projected blueshift of @xmath256 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite note that many sbs expand slower than predicted given the mechanical energy input of stellar winds and sn .",
    "they posit that hot gas may be escaping through holes in the photoionized shell thus decreasing the internal pressure .",
    "this process leads to galactic chimneys on larger scales and is thought to be responsible for the general hot phase of the ism .",
    "a hot component escaping at the observed velocity might be evidence for such an ``  leak . ''",
    "if confirmed , such a model might increase the viability of shocks contributing significantly to the observed  excess from n70 .",
    "we have compared _ fuse _  data for four sight lines through the @xmath21 pc diameter lmc superbubble n70 with four nearby sight lines sampling diffuse and field regions in the lmc .",
    "this position on the eastern edge of the lmc is isolated from other large - scale ism structures such as supergiant shells ,  regions , supernova remnants , and other sbs .",
    "thus , our sight lines are subject to minimal sight line confusion .",
    "we see strong  absorption in all eight sight lines organized into two clear absorption components ; one at @xmath257 km  s@xmath12  arising in the galactic halo , and another at @xmath258 km  s@xmath12  from lmc gas .",
    "we measure  absorption using both integrated apparent optical depth and profile - fitting methods ; both methods yield consistent results .",
    "the galactic column densities , line widths , and profile shapes are equivalent for the n70 and comparison sight lines and are consistent with typical galactic @xmath4  seen in other surveys .",
    "the n70 sight lines show a @xmath259 dex ( @xmath156 ) higher column density at lmc velocities than the comparison sight lines , larger than the scatter in either sample .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath260  @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the n70  profiles show slightly broader absorption than do the comparison profiles .",
    "our measured @xmath4  values for both n70 and comparison sight lines are consistent with those found by @xcite in an earlier survey of lmc  absorption along twelve sight lines . while howk et al .",
    "claim no correlation between @xmath4  and ism morphology ( as measured by either stellar spectral type or h@xmath5  or soft x - ray surface brightness ) , we find that our n70 @xmath4  is consistent with that measured in four sb sight lines in their sample .",
    "similarly , our four comparison measurements are entirely consistent with the eight non - sb measurements in the howk et al . sample .",
    "we show that the sb and non - sb samples show distinct mean @xmath4  but that the scatter ( as expected from halo variation ) is equivalent for both samples .",
    "this is strong evidence that sbs ( including n70 ) produce a local reservoir of  distinct and distinguishable from the general , overlying halo absorption seen in nearly all lmc sight lines .",
    "we compare  absorption to , a reliable tracer of the warm lmc disk gas .",
    "the strongest  absorption traces the systemic velocity of lmc disk gas near n70 at @xmath261 km  s@xmath12  and the observed  absorption is consistent with an expansion velocity of @xmath1 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "however , it is also consistent with the general trend of blueshifted halo  absorption with respect to  seen by @xcite .",
    "we consider four different ionization mechanisms ( photoionization , shocks , turbulent mixing layers , and conductive interfaces ) and conclude that thermal conduction between the interior hot , x - ray producing gas and the cool , photoionized shell of n70 is the most feasible production mechanism for the observed . the inferred shock velocity ( @xmath230 km  s@xmath12 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is insufficient to ionize the sb shell to the observed level .",
    "we calculate the total hydrogen density implied by our @xmath4  measurements and find @xmath262 for a 5 pc  shell , consistent with expected values .",
    "our lwrs apertures lie just outside the shell of n70 and show no  emission to a fairly sensitive level ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "future detections of diffuse  emission toward n70 will conclusively demonstrate the existence of  within the sb .",
    "in addition , emission - absorption measurements can constrain the density and distribution of hot gas within n70 .",
    "it is our pleasure to acknowledge fruitful discussions with jonathan slavin , mike shull , you - hua chu , ken sembach , alex fullerton , and ravi sankrit .",
