    "most galactic nuclei are thought to host massive black holes and dense clusters of stars whose structure and kinematics are correlated with global galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "such correlations raise questions of great interest related to galaxy formation and the growth of nuclear black holes .",
    "the nearby large spiral galaxy m31 has an off  centered peak in a double  peaked brightness distribution around its nuclear black hole @xcite .",
    "this lopsided brightness distribution could arise naturally if the apoapses of many stellar orbits , orbiting the black hole , happened to be clustered together @xcite .",
    "since then , kinematic and dynamical models of such an eccentric disc have been constructed by several authors @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to this work is the model of @xcite , which included a few per cent of stars on retrograde ( i.e. counter  rotating ) orbits .",
    "they proposed that these stars could have been accreted to the centre of m31 in the form of a globular cluster that spiraled in due to dynamical friction .",
    "this proposal was motivated by the work of @xcite , who demonstrated that a keplerian axisymmetric disc is susceptible to a linear lopsided instability in the @xmath1 mode , even when a small fraction of the disc mass is in retrograde motion .",
    "@xcite considered the linearized secular dynamics of particles orbiting a point mass , wherein particle orbits may be thought of as slowly deforming elliptical rings of small eccentricities .",
    "the @xmath0 counter  rotating instability was studied analytically for a two  ring system , and numerically for a many  ring system . the corresponding problem for continuous discs",
    "was then studied by @xcite , who proposed a simple model with dynamics that could be studied largely analytically in the wentzel ",
    "kramers  brillouin ( wkb ) approximation .",
    "their model consisted of a two  component _ softened _ gravity disc , orbiting a massive central black hole .",
    "softened gravity was introduced by @xcite to simplify the analysis of the dynamics of stellar systems . in this form of interaction ,",
    "the newtonian @xmath2 gravitational potential is replaced by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is called the _ softening length_. in the context of waves in discs , it is well known that the softening length mimics the epicyclic radius of stars on nearly circular orbits @xcite .",
    "therefore , a disc composed of cold collisionless matter , interacting via softened gravity , provides a surrogate for a _ hot _ collisionless disc .",
    "@xcite used a short  wavelength ( wkb ) approximation , derived analytical expressions for the dispersion relation and showed that the frequency @xmath5 is smaller than the keplerian orbital frequency by a factor proportional to the small quantity @xmath6 ( which is the ratio of the disc mass to mass of the central object ) ; in other words , the modes are _ slow_. the wkb dispersion relation was used to argue that equal mass counter  rotating discs with the same surface density profiles ( i.e. when there is not net rotation ) could have unstable modes .",
    "they also argued that , for an arbitrary mass ratio , the discs must be unrealistically hot to avoid an instability .",
    "@xcite then used bohr ",
    "sommerfeld quantization to construct global modes , within the wkb approximation",
    ". a matter of concern is that the wavelengths of the modes could be of order the scale length of the discs ; the modes being large  scale it is possible that the wkb approximation itself is invalid .",
    "another limitation is that @xcite could construct ( wkb ) global modes only for the case of equal mass discs .",
    "therefore it is necessary to address the full eigenvalue problem to understand the systematic behaviour of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . to this end",
    ", we formulate the eigenvalue problem for the linear , slow , @xmath0 modes in a two  component , softened gravity , counter  rotating disc . due to the long  range nature of gravitational interactions",
    ", we have to deal with a pair of coupled integral equations defining the eigenvalue problem .",
    "we draw some general conclusions and then proceed to solve the equations numerically for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .    in ",
    "2 we introduce the unperturbed two  component nearly keplerian disc , define the apse precession rates , discuss the potential theory for softened gravity , and derive the coupled , linear integral equations that determine the eigenvalue problems for slow @xmath0 modes . a derivation of the relationship between the softened laplace coefficients ( used in the potential theory of   2 and   3 ) and",
    "the usual ( unsoftened ) laplace coefficients is given in the appendix .",
    "we specialize to discs with similar surface density profiles in   3 , when the two coupled equations can be cast as a single integral equation in a new mode variable ; this allows us to draw some general conclusions about the eigenvalue problem .",
    "we also discuss in detail the numerical method to be employed .",
    "our results are presented in   4 , where the properties of the stable , unstable and overstable modes are discussed .",
    "conclusions are offered in   5 , where we seek to provide a global perspective on the correlations that occur between the pattern speeds , growth rates and eigenfunctions , as well as the variations of these quantities on the mass fraction in retrograde orbits .",
    "we consider linear non  axisymmetric perturbations in two counter  rotating discs orbiting a central point mass @xmath7 .",
    "the discs are assumed to be coplanar and consist of cold collisionless particles which attract each other through softened gravity .",
    "however , the central mass and the disc particles interact via the usual ( unsoftened ) newtonian gravity .",
    "softened gravity is known to mimic the effects of velocity dispersion , so our discs are surrogates for hot stellar discs .",
    "we assume that the total mass in the discs , @xmath8 , is small in comparison to the central mass .",

    "we are able to provide much more detail , essentially because we are dealing with continuous discs rather than a finite number of rings .",
    "as @xmath90 increases from @xmath188 , the eigenvalues go from real to complex , a bifurcation that has been traced in @xcite to a phenomenon identified by m.  j.  krein due to the resonant crossing of stable modes .",
    "the complex eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs , so there are two branches to the distribution . as @xmath90 increases , the branches progressively separate and , for @xmath115 must lie along the positive and negative imaginary axes .",
    "it is intriguing that each of these two branches consists of more than one arm . in the close  up views provided by the @xmath193 panels , it appears as if each of the branches has two arms ; however , more detailed investigations are required to determine if there are more arms .",
    "the arms of each of the branches are most widely separated when @xmath194 , which is the value of @xmath90 exactly midway in its range @xmath195 .",

    "[ fig9 ] shows two such pairs of eigenfunctions for @xmath187 .",
    "we have looked at pairs of such eigenfunctions for other values of @xmath90 , but do not display them , here we note what seems to be a general trend : ( i ) the two members of a pair are more similar to each other when the values of their @xmath199 are closer to each other ; ( ii ) the member of a pair with the smaller value of @xmath203 is more displaced toward larger radii .",
    "we study linear , _ slow _",
    "@xmath0 modes in softened gravity , counter  rotating keplerian discs .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is formulated as a pair of coupled integral equations for the @xmath36 modes .",
    "we then specialize to the case when the two discs have similar surface density profiles but different @xmath36 disc masses .",
    "it is of great interest to study the properties of the modes as a function of @xmath90 , which is the fraction of the total disc mass in the retrograde population .",
    "recasting the coupled equations as a single equation in a new modal variable , we are able to demonstrate some general properties : for instance , when @xmath197 , the eigenvalues must be purely imaginary or , equivalently , the modes are purely unstable . in other words ,",
    "when the @xmath36 discs have identical surface density profiles then there are growing @xmath0 modes with zero pattern speed , a conclusion which is consistent with @xcite . to study modes for general values of @xmath90 ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem needs to be solved numerically .",
    "our method is broadly based on @xcite , but there are some differences whose details have been discussed in the text .",
    "the main point of departure is in the way that softening has been treated . in @xcite ,",
    "a dimensionless softening parameter @xmath146 was introduced , and the eigenvalue problem was solved by holding the parameter @xmath147 constant .",
    "this procedure renders the physical softening length , @xmath19 , effectively dependent on radius ( making it larger at larger radii ) , thereby not corresponding to any simple force law between two disc particles located at different radii .",
    "we have preferred to keep @xmath19 constant , so that the force law between two disc particles is through the usual miller prescription .",
    "we calculate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions numerically for discs with surface density profiles of kuzmin form .",
    "kuzmin discs , being centrally concentrated , are reasonable candidates for unperturbed discs . moreover ,",
    "earlier investigations of slow modes @xcite have explored modes in kuzmin discs , so this choice is particularly useful for comparisons with earlier work .",
    "comparing our results with those of @xcite for @xmath196 ( when the slow modes are stable ) , we find that the eigenfunctions are of broadly similar form , but the eigenvalues differ by up to @xmath171 ; this is a result of the different ways in which we have treated softening . for the case of no net rotation ( @xmath197 ) , we find that the growth rates ( of the unstable modes ) we calculate are broadly consistent with the short  wavelength branch of the global wkb modes determined earlier by @xcite , but not their long  wavelength branch .",
    "this disagreement probably arises because the long  wavelength branch corresponds to wavelengths of order the disc scale length where wkb approximation breaks down .",
    "moreover , the agreement between our results and their short ",
    "wavelength branch holds only in a broad sense , because there are differences in the numerical values of the eigenvalues .",
    "we trace this difference to the fact that @xcite used an analytical result for the precession frequency corresponding to unsoftened gravity , whereas we have consistently used softened gravity for all gravitational interactions between disc particles .",
    "we have also investigate eigenmodes for values of @xmath90 other than @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "these cases are particularly interesting , not only because they were not explored by @xcite , but because the eigenvalues can be truly complex , corresponding to growing ( and damped ) modes with non zero pattern speeds .",
    "we have presented results for @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the previous sections .",
    "based on these , we interpolate and offer the following conclusions about the properties of the eigenmodes and their physical implications , for all values of @xmath90 ( which is the mass fraction in the retrograde population ) :    1 .   for a general value of @xmath90 ( between @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) , the distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane has two branches .",
    "these branches are symmetrically placed about the real axis , because the eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "2 .   the pattern speed appears to be non negative for all values of @xmath90 , with the growth ( or damping ) rate being larger for larger values of the pattern speed .",
    "3 .   for a fixed value of @xmath90 ,",
    "the number of nodes of the eigenfunctions decreases with increasing pattern speed and growth ( or damping ) rate .",
    "4 .   for a value of pattern speed in a chosen narrow interval , the growth ( or damping ) rate increases as @xmath90 increases from @xmath188 to @xmath189 . 5 .",
    "each of the two branches in the complex ( eigenvalue ) plane has at least two arms .",
    "when @xmath196 , the eigenvalues are all real , so both branches lie on the real axis , with zero spacing between the arms . as @xmath90 increases , the branches lift out of the real axis , and the arms separate .",
    "it appears as if the maximum separation between the arms happens when @xmath204 .",
    "as @xmath90 increases further , the branches continue to rise with greater slope , while the arm separation begins decreasing .",
    "finally , when @xmath197 , the arm separation decreases to zero as the branches lie on the imaginary axis .    observations of lopsided brightness distributions around massive black holes are somewhat more likely to favour the detection of modes with fewer nodes than modes with a large number of nodes , because the former suffer less cancellation due to finite angular resolution . from items ( ii ) and ( iii ) above , we note that the modes with a small number of nodes also happen to be those with larger values of the pattern speed and growth rate , both qualities that enable detection to a greater degree .",
    "having said this , it would be appropriate to note some limitations of our work . softened gravity discs are , after all , surrogates for discs composed of collisionless particles ( such as stars ) with non zero thickness and velocity dispersions .",
    "it is necessary to formulate the eigenvalue problem for truly collisionless discs , in order to really deal with stellar discs around massive black holes .",
    "meanwhile , our results will serve as a benchmark for future investigations of modes in these more realistic models .",
