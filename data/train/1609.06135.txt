    "how much can you tell about the past of a quantum system from its present state ? this is the problem of retrodiction @xcite .",
    "one is often concerned with prediction , for example , describing the results of measurements made on the system at a later time .",
    "retrodiction is concerned with the past of the system .",
    "an example of a situation that encompasses both prediction and retrodiction is given by the standard setup in quantum communication theory @xcite .",
    "alice chooses a state from a set of states known to alice and bob , and sends it to bob , who then measures the state .",
    "alice would like to predict the result of bob s measurement based on which state she sent , and bob would like to retrodict which state alice sent .",
    "the theory of quantum retrodiction allows one to define a retrodictive state , which can be used to make predictions @xcite .",
    "this point of view has been used to analyze a number of systems in quantum optics , including a beam splitter @xcite , amplifiers and attenuators @xcite , and a driven atom @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to both closed and open systems @xcite .    here",
    "we shall be interested in the retrodiction of measurement results .",
    "suppose a quantum system has been prepared in a quantum state and then subjected to a series of measurements .",
    "different measurement results will lead to different final states of the system .",
    "we assume that all we have access to is the final state of the system , and not the results of the measurements , and we would like to gain information about those results .",
    "the set of measurement results can be viewed as a trajectory of the quantum system , and we will explore what can be learned about that trajectory from the final state of the system . we may be interested in only part of the trajectory , the entire trajectory , or determining whether a particular trajectory did not occur .",
    "the problem studied here is closely related to that of sequential measurements on the same quantum system @xcite .",
    "rather surprisingly , it has been shown that one can gain information about the initial state of a system even though a measurement has intervened and changed the state of the system @xcite . in our case , for the measurements determining the trajectory",
    ", subsequent measurements can disturb the quantum state resulting from a previous one , thereby complicating the task of determining the trajectory .",
    "we shall approach the problem of retrodicting measurement results from the final state in two ways .",
    "after a short discussion of some simple cases , we will see what can be done when a quantum system is subjected to two two - outcome measurements , the second of which is a projective measurement .",
    "next , we will study a simple model that will allow us to look at more general types of measurements .",
    "the picture behind the model is that of a photon going through a sequence of interferometers , where in each interferometer there is a detector that gives us information about which path the photon took through that interferometer .",
    "we would like to find out what we can infer about the photon s path , i.e.  the results of the path detectors , from its state when it emerges from the final interferometer .",
    "we will make use of a qubit instead of a photon , and instead of measuring paths , our detectors will tell us whether the qubit is in the state @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "a measurement is described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) , which is a set of positive operators , @xmath2 such that @xmath3 .",
    "if the state being measured is @xmath4 , then the probability of obtaining the result @xmath5 is @xmath6 , and if the result @xmath5 is obtained , the state after the measurement is @xmath7 . while this not the most general measurement model possible , ( see @xcite )",
    ", it will suffice for our purposes here .",
    "we can obtain an idea of the range of possible relations between a sequence of measurement results and the final state of a system by considering some simple examples . at one extreme , there are cases in which we learn nothing about the measurement results from the final state of the system .",
    "let us consider making two measurements on a qubit , with the first measurement described by @xmath8 the second by @xmath9 .",
    "we will consider the case in which all of these operators are diagonal in the computational basis @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 now suppose we start the qubit in the state @xmath0 .",
    "the probability that we obtain @xmath5 for the first measurement and @xmath13 for the second , where @xmath14 is @xmath15 , but in all cases the final state of the system is @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in this case , we learn nothing about the results of the measurements from the final state of the system .",
    "we also note that each measurement is independent of the ones before it .",
    "a less extreme case is when the measurement operators are one - dimensional projections .",
    "then the final state of the system is determined only by the final measurement result , and so it would seem to carry no information about the previous ones .",
    "however , the probability that a particular final state occurs does depend on the results of the previous measurements , so we can infer some information about those measurements from the final state . a measurement sequence of this type can be described as a markov chain .",
    "the probability of a measurement result only depends on the result of the previous measurement , because that measurement determines the state that is being measured .",
    "finally , suppose our system consists of two qubits , and the measurement operators are given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are orthogonal one - dimensional projections .",
    "the first measurement only measures the first qubit , and the second measures the second . in this case ,",
    "different final states are correlated with different sequences of measurement results , and these states are orthogonal .",
    "therefore , by measuring the final state of the system we will know what both measurement results were .",
    "what we can conclude from these examples is that there is wide range of behaviors possible .",
    "correlations between final states and measurement results can range from nonexistent to perfect . in order to further examine what is possible ,",
    "let us first look at the case of two two - outcome measurements .",
    "we start with the system in the state @xmath20 , and perform two two - outcome measurements on it .",
    "we denote the outcomes of the measurements by @xmath21 .",
    "the first measurement is described by a povm @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "if the measurement result was @xmath24 the post - measurement state is @xmath25 , and if the result was @xmath26 it is @xmath27 .",
    "we shall assume for now that the second measurement is described by the projections @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "now suppose we have been given the system after the measurements have been made , and we would like to determine the result of the first measurement . this can be viewed as a problem of discriminating between two density matrices .",
    "the first density matrix is the one that results at the output if the result of the first measurement was @xmath24 , which is given by @xmath30 , \\ ] ] and it occurs with a probability of @xmath31 .",
    "the second density matrix is the one that results if the result of the first measurement is @xmath26 , @xmath32 , \\ ] ] and it occurs with a probability of @xmath33 .",
    "these density matrices can not , in general , be perfectly distinguished , so we need to turn to a strategy that will give us some information about which one we have .",
    "the minimum - error strategy minimizes the probability of making a mistake .",
    "suppose we are trying to discriminate between two density matrices , @xmath34 , which occurs with probability @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , which occurs with probability @xmath37 .",
    "minimum - error discrimination gives us a two - element povm , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 corresponds to detecting @xmath34 and @xmath40 corresponds to detecting @xmath36 .",
    "the probability of successfully identifying the state is @xmath41 and for the optimal povm , that is , for the one that minimizes the probability of making a mistake , is given by @xmath42 , \\ ] ] where the norm in the above equation is the trace norm @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath43 , the povm element corresponding to detecting @xmath34 , @xmath39 , is the projection onto the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath44 with positive eigenvalues , and the povm element corresponding to detecting @xmath36 , @xmath40 , is the projection onto the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath44 with either negative or zero eigenvalues ( the states with eigenvalue zero can be placed in either povm element , we have chosen to include them in the one corresponding to @xmath36 ) .    in our case",
    ", we can evaluate the trace norm .",
    "note that we have @xmath45 the trace norm can be split into two parts , because @xmath46 and @xmath47 have orthogonal supports . in each of the parts ,",
    "the problem is reduced to finding the trace norm of a two dimensional matrix . in the first term , the support of the operator is the subspace spanned by the vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and for the second term the support lies in the subspace spanned by the vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    ", it must be the case that @xmath61 and @xmath62 for some @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for the case of a qubit , this can occur when @xmath65 , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    for qubits",
    ", we can go further . assuming that @xmath28 are rank one projections , the inner products in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) factorize , and we have that @xmath70 where @xmath71 , for @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the probability that the first measurement gives the result @xmath13 and the second gives @xmath5 . from this , we see that if the probabilities of the different measurement outcomes are close to the same , it will be difficult to distinguish the output states corresponding to different values of the first measurement . for qudits ,",
    "the expression on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ qubit - lambda ] ) is a lower bound for @xmath44 , so its value gives a worst case for ones ability to determine the result of the first measurement .",
    "now let us look at determining the results of both measurements .",
    "in the case we have been considering so far , in which the second measurement is a projective one is straightforward , because the projections @xmath46 and @xmath47 have orthogonal support , which implies that the states that result from different outcomes for the second measurement are perfectly distinguishable .",
    "this also makes it simple to determine the results of both measurements .",
    "first we measure the output state in order to determine whether it is in the support of @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "that reduces the problem to one of distinguishing between two states , for example , if the output state was found to be in the support of @xmath46 , then we would need to discriminate between @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this can then be accomplished by using minimum error discrimination .",
    "the success probability for determining both measurements using this procedure is the same as that of determining the result of the first measurement , @xmath76 , where @xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "this is shown in greater detail in appendix a , and it is also shown there that this procedure is optimal .    in the next section , we will look at the case when both measurements are povm s for a simple example , a double qubit interferometer .",
    "we will see what one can learn about the path taken through the interferometer , which is specified by the results of two measurements , by measuring the final state of the qubit .",
    "can one learn more about the path of the qubit if the measurements are less disturbing and , therefore , interfere with each other less ?",
    "in particular , if the second measurement is not a projection , one would expect more information about the result of the first measurement to make it through to the final state .",
    "our model allows us to examine this idea .",
    "we shall consider a qubit double interferometer based on the qubit single interferometer used by englert to derive a visibility - path - information duality relation @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to consider measurements other than projective measurements .",
    "we start the qubit in the state @xmath0 and it then passes through a hadamard gate , which puts it in the state @xmath77 , where we have denoted the operator corresponding to the hadamard gate by @xmath78 . note that @xmath79 .",
    "we then measure which path the qubit took , by which we mean whether it is in the state @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the qubit then passes through a second hadamard gate , and we again measure whether it is in the state @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the qubit then passes through a final hadamard gate .",
    "we can view the measurement results as defining a trajectory that the qubit follows through the interferometer , and we are interested in determining what information we can gain about the trajectory by measuring the state of the qubit when it emerges from the interferometer",
    ".    the measurements will not necessarily extract all of the information about the qubit s state so that we can examine the relation between how much path information is extracted and the final state of the qubit . to measure the qubit going through the interferometer ( qubit @xmath80 ) we couple it first to a second qubit ( qubit @xmath81 ) , which is initially in the state @xmath82 , using the unitary operation @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 controls how much information the measurement extracts about the path .",
    "if @xmath86 no path information is extracted , while if @xmath87 the maximum amount of information is extracted . when we measure the auxiliary qubit , we perform the optimal minimum error measurement to distinguish @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "that means we measure in the basis @xmath90 .",
    "we shall interpret the result @xmath26 , meaning @xmath91 as corresponding to qubit @xmath80 being in the state @xmath92 and @xmath24 corresponding to qubit @xmath80 being in the state @xmath93 .",
    "let us now find the measurement operators corresponding to this procedure .",

    "is there a measurement we can make that will allow us to say something definite about a trajectory ?",
    "the answer to this question is yes if instead of asking which trajectory occurred , we ask if there is one that did not occur .",
    "measurements can be used to identify states , but they can also be used to eliminate states from a known set @xcite . this type of measurement has proven useful in quantum digital signature schemes @xcite . here",

    "2 . as expected , the success probability is lower than in the two - loop case , but , more interestingly , the behavior is quite different as well . instead of approaching a plateau ,",
    "the success probability reaches a maximum and then decreases .",
    "the success probability goes to @xmath261 at @xmath87 , because at that value of @xmath123 , the eight possible output states collapse down to two , @xmath262 , so that each output state corresponds to four different trajectories .",
    "the fact that the maximum success probability occurs at an intermediate value of @xmath123 , where the final state depends on all of the measurement results , is more in line with one s expectations than the result in the two - loop case where @xmath247 was a maximum when it depended only on the result of the second measurement .",
    "we have studied a number of instances of the effect of measurements on the final state of a quantum system , and our ability to use that state to retrodict the results of the measurements .",
    "this ability can range from none to perfect , depending on the measurement and the initial state of the quantum system . using a qubit interferometer , we examined the retrodiction of a sequence of measurements for which we could vary the strength of the measurements .",
    "the measurement we make on the final state of the quantum system depends on what we want to find out about the sequence of previous measurements .",
    "we may want to find out the result of only one of the measurements , all of them , or find a measurement sequence that was not realized .    in our study of the two loop interferometer",
    ", we found that the highest success probability for determining the result of the first measurement occurred when both measurements were weaker than full projective measurements .",
    "if the second measurement is a projective one , it erases the information about the first measurement .",
    "surprisingly , however , if we are trying to determine the results of both measurements , we found that the case with the highest success probability was when both measurements were projective .",
    "we were also able to construct a measurement that would conclusively eliminate one of the trajectories . in the case of a three loop interferometer , when determining the entire trajectory the highest success probability occurred when the measurements were weaker than projective measurements .",
    "there are issues that could benefit from further study . in all of the cases we examined , the party making the final state measurement and at least one of the parties making the earlier measurements share information , which means that this process can be viewed as a kind of communication channel .",
    "this is the case , because the final state of a quantum system usually does carry information about the history of measurements on the system , and it is possible to gain access to this information by making measurements on the final state .",
    "this suggests that the application of information measures to this problem would be a fruitful .",
    "a second topic , which was not addressed here , is the role of the initial state .",
    "some initial states will prove better than others in transmitting the information about the measurement results to the final state .",
    "we hope to make both of these issues the subject of future work .",
    "this research was supported by a grant from the john templeton foundation .",
    "here we will look in more detail at the case of two two - outcome measurements when the second measurement is a projective one , which was discussed in section iii .",
    "the strategy for determining the outcome of both measurements was first to measure which of the two subspaces , the one corresponding to @xmath46 or the one corresponding to @xmath47 , the final state of the system is in .",
    "since it is definitely in one of these subspaces , and the subspaces are orthogonal , this measurement is deterministic .",
    "one then performs one of two minimum - error measurements , which one depends on which subspace the state is in , in order to determine the result of the first measurement .",
    "we want to determine the overall success probability of this procedure .",
    "the probability that the final state is in the subspace corresponding to @xmath46 is @xmath263 and the probability that it is in the subspace corresponding to @xmath47 is @xmath264 where @xmath265 , and @xmath72 .",
    "if we find that the state is in the subspace corresponding to @xmath46 then we are faced with discriminating between two states , @xmath266 , which occurs with a probability of @xmath267 and @xmath268 , which occurs with probability @xmath269 the success probability for this problem is given by @xmath270 , where @xmath271 similarly , if one finds the final state in the support of @xmath47 , one wants to discriminate between @xmath272 and @xmath273 , and this can be done with a success probability of @xmath274 , where @xmath275 the overall success probability is @xmath276 which is the same as eq .",
    "( [ lambda1 ] ) .",
    "now we would like to show that the optimal four - element povm for determining the final state in this case splits into a two - element povm on the support of @xmath46 and a two - element povm on the support of @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that the optimal povm is the one discussed above , where we determine which subspace , support of @xmath46 or support of @xmath47 , the final state is in and then apply the optimal two - element povm to distinguish between the two possible final states in that subspace .",
    "now suppose that the optimal povm is @xmath277 .",
    "the success probability for this measurement is @xmath278 we first note that @xmath279 which implies that @xmath280 now define a new povm @xmath281 this is a povm , because its elements sum to the identity , see eq .",
    "( [ id - sum ] ) , and all of the operators are positive",
    ". it also has the property that its success probability , @xmath282 satisfies @xmath283 .",
    "for example , looking at the first terms in the sums for the two probabilities , we see that @xmath284 where the second term on the right - hand side is clearly nonnegative .",
    "so each term in the sum for @xmath285 is greater than or equal to the corresponding term in the sum for @xmath247 .",
    "since we can take any povm and create another one , which has the property that two of its elements have support in the support of @xmath46 and two have support in the support of @xmath47 , and this second povm has a greater than or equal success probability , the optimal povm will have @xmath286 and @xmath287 with support in the support of @xmath46 and @xmath288 and @xmath289 with support in the support of @xmath47 .",
