    "following the discovery of the @xmath3 meson at spear in 1976 , experimenters began to search for @xmath0 mixing , using a variety of techniques .",
    "the past decade has seen significant experimental progress in sensitivity ( from 20% to 0.37%  @xcite to  @xcite ) , as can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "much of the enthusiasm for searching for @xmath0 mixing stems from the belief that the search carries a large discovery potential for new physics , since the mixing rate @xmath4/ @xmath5 is expected to be very small in the standard model .",
    "one can characterize @xmath0 mixing in terms of two dimensionless variables : @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 @xmath13 being the masses and decay rates of the two cp ( even and odd ) eigenstates . assuming a small mixing , namely , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 .",
    "mixing can be caused either by @xmath17 ( meaning that mixing is genuinely caused by the @xmath18 transition ) or by @xmath19 ( meaning mixing is caused by the fact that the fast decaying component quickly disapears , leaving the slow decaying component which is a mixture of @xmath3 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations of @xmath0 mixing in the standard model are plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "while short distance effects from box diagrams are known  @xcite to give a negligible contribution ( @xmath21 ) , the long distance effects from second - order weak interactions with mesonic intermediate states may give a much larger contribution .",
    "estimates of @xmath22 from long distance effects range from @xmath23 to @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been argued by georgi and others that the long distance contributions are smaller than previously estimated , implying that cancellations occur between contributions from different classes of intermediate mesonic states  @xcite , and the prevailing conclusion within the standard model seems to be that @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of such a small mixing rate is not possible with present experimental sensitivity .",
    "however , the observation of a larger value for @xmath22 caused by @xmath17 would imply the existence of new physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "examples includes flavor - changing neutral currents mediated by the exchange of a non - standard higgs scalar with a mass of a few tev / c@xmath26 , which could lead to @xmath22 as large as @xmath27 .",
    "recently , cleo has observed a signal for @xmath28  @xcite , and found @xmath29 = @xmath30 @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "normally , @xmath3 decays by cabibbo favored decay @xmath32 and @xmath33 . a signal for @xmath34 could indicate mixing of @xmath35 .",
    "but it could also indicate a different decay channel , namely , doubly cabibbo suppressed decay(dcsd ) @xmath34 , which is suppressed with respect to the cabibbo favored decay by a factor of @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "unfortunately , without a precision vertex detector , cleo is unable to distinguish a potential mixing signal from dcsd . as purohit pointed out  @xcite :  the cleo ii result makes the entire subject of @xmath0 mixing very interesting .",
    "it really calls for a fixed - target experiment to use its decay time resolution to decide whether the signal is due to dcsd or mixing \" .",
    "if the number of reconstructed charm decays can reach @xmath38 around the year 2000 , that would allow one to reach a new threshold of sensitivity to @xmath0 mixing , and perhaps actually observe it .",
    "this is why charm mixing has been singled out for its own working group at this workshop .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 discusses the techniques which can be used to search for mixing , including two new ideas .",
    "one of them is to use @xmath39 etc . to study mixing ( see 2.1.1 ) , and the other is to use the difference in the resonant substruture in @xmath40,@xmath41 etc .",
    "to distingusih mixing and dcsd ( see 2.1.2 ) . in each case , the relevant phenomenology will be briefly presented .",
    "section 3 discusses the present status and future prospects of searching for mixing at different experiments . in section 4",
    ", a comparison of the future prospects of the different experiments with different techniques will be given .",
    "a brief summary is in section 5 .",
    "the techniques which can be used to search for mixing can be roughly divided into two classes : hadronic and semi - leptonic .",
    "each method has advantages and limitations , which are described below .",
    "the hadronic method is to search for the @xmath3 decays @xmath42 .",
    "these decays can occur either through @xmath0 mixing followed by cabibbo favored decay @xmath43(x ) , or through dcsd @xmath42 .",
    "this means that the major complication for this method is the need to distinguish between dcsd and mixing  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic method can therefore be classified according to how dcsd and mixing are distinguished . in principle , there are at least three different ways to distinguish between dcsd and mixing candidates experimentally : ( a ) use the difference in the decay time - dependence ; ( b ) use the possible difference in the resonant substructure in @xmath40,@xmath44 , etc .",
    "modes ; ( c ) use the quantum statistics of the production and the decay processes .    method ( a ) requires that the @xmath3 be highly boosted and so that the decay time information can be measured .",
    "method ( b ) requires knowledge of the resonant substructure of the dcsd decays , which is unfortunately something about which we have no idea at this time .",
    "finally , method ( c ) requires that one use @xmath45 annihilation in the charm threshold region . in the following",
    ", we will discuss these three methods in some detail .",
    "this method  @xcite is to measure the decay time of the @xmath34 decay . here",
    "the @xmath3 tagging is usually done by using the decay chain @xmath46 followed by @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 from @xmath49 has a soft momentum spectrum and is refered to as the slow pion .",
    "the idea is to search for the wrong sign @xmath49 decays , where the slow pion has the same charge as the kaon arising from the @xmath3 decay .",
    "this technique utilizes the following facts : ( 1 ) dcsd and mixing have different decay time - dependence , which will be described below .",
    "( 2 ) the charge of the slow pion is correlated with the charm quantum number of the @xmath3 meson and thus can be used to tag whether a @xmath3 or @xmath20 meson was produced in the decay @xmath46 or @xmath50 .",
    "( 3 ) the small @xmath51 value of the @xmath49 decay results in a very good mass resolution in the mass difference @xmath52 and allows a @xmath49 signal to obtained with very low background . ( 4 ) the right sign signal @xmath46 followed by @xmath53 can be used to provide a model - independent normalization for the mixing measurement .",
    "a pure @xmath3 state generated at @xmath54 decays to the @xmath55 state either by @xmath0 mixing or by dcsd , and the two amplitudes may interfere .",
    "the amplitude for a @xmath3 decays to @xmath55 relative to the amplitude for a @xmath3 decays to @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an unknown phase , t is measured in units of average @xmath3 lifetime . here",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 , denoting the relative strength of dcsd .",
    "we have also assumed a small mixing ; namely , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and cp conservation .",
    "the first term , which is proportional to @xmath62 , is due to mixing and the second term is due to dcsd .",
    "it is this unique attribute of the decay time - dependence of mixing which can be used to distinguish between dcsd and mixing .",
    "now we have : @xmath63 define @xmath64 , which describes the strength of mixing relative to dcsd .",
    "equation ( 2 ) can then be rewritten as : @xmath65    from this equation , one may read off the following properties : ( 1 ) the mixing term peaks at @xmath66 . ( 2 ) the interference term peaks at @xmath67 . ( 3 ) a small mixing signature can be greatly enhanced by dcsd through interference ( with @xmath68 ) at lower decay times .",
    "the ratio between the interference term and the mixing term , denoted @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "so when @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "for example ,",
    "with @xmath74=1 , at @xmath67 for @xmath75 ( corresponding to @xmath76 ) one has @xmath77 respectively .",
    "( 4 ) only for @xmath78 does the interference term become smaller than the mixing term . ( 5 ) @xmath79 happens and only happens when @xmath80 , and only at location @xmath81 . for @xmath82 , one has @xmath83 .",
    "( 6 ) one can obtain a very pure dcsd sample by cutting at low decay time : @xmath84 . at such low @xmath62 ,",
    "the mixing term drops out and leaving only the interference term .",
    "let s define the purity of dcsd to be @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath86 one get @xmath87 .",
    "let s take @xmath88 , for @xmath89 , we can get @xmath90 pure dcsd respectively . ( 7 ) the cut @xmath91 cuts off only @xmath92 from the whole interference term .    while property ( 1 ) tells us that the mixing term does live at longer decay time , property ( 3 ) tells us clearly that we should not ignore the interference term .",
    "in fact , that s the last thing one wants to ignore ! ( unless we know for sure @xmath93 ) .",
    "it is the commonly believed `` annoying background '' , namely dcsd , that could greatly enhance the chance of seeing a very small mixing signal . in semi - leptonic method",
    ", one does not have this advantage .",
    "for a very small mixing rate , almost all the mixing signature could show up in the interference term , not in the mixing term , as long as @xmath94 .",
    "property ( 2 ) tells us at which location one expect to find the richest signature of a potential small mixing , which is where the interference term peaks : @xmath95 ( why should one keep worrying about long lived dcsd tails ? let s hope for @xmath94 first . )",
    "property ( 5 ) shows that destructive interference is not necessarily a bad thing .",
    "in fact , it could provide extra information .",
    "for example , if @xmath96 , then one should find @xmath79 at @xmath81 , see figure 5 .",
    "for the general case , interference will lead to very characteristic time distribution , as can be clearly seen in figure 6 .",
    "properties ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) show that we can study dcsd well without being confused by the possible mixing component .",
    "this will become important when we discuss method b.    therefore the signature of mixing is a deviation from a perfect exponential time distribution with the slope of @xmath97   to study the acceptance function versus decay time . ] .",
    "our ability to observe this signature depends on the number of @xmath34 events we will have .",
    "right now this is limited by the rather poor statistics .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show each term with @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( with @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is interesting to point out here that there is also a possibility , previously unrecognized , of using the singly cabibbo suppressed decays ( scsd ) , such as @xmath39 to study mixing .",
    "this is because ( assuming cp conservation ) those decays occur only through the cp even eigenstate , which means the decay time distribution is a perfect exponential with the slope of @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , one can use those modes to measure @xmath101 .",
    "the mixing signature is not a deviation from a perfect exponential ( again assuming cp conservation ) , but rather a deviation of the slope from @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath103 can be measured by using the @xmath32 decay time distribution , one can then derive @xmath104 .",
    "observation of a non - zero @xmath105 would demonstrate mixing caused by the decay rate difference ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in this case other cp even ( odd ) final states such as @xmath106 @xmath107 can be also used to measure @xmath108 .",
    "in addition , there is no need to tag the @xmath3 nor know the primary vertex location , since we only need to determine the slope .",
    "i should point out also that this method is only sensitive to mixing caused by the decay rate difference between the two eigen states , not to mixing caused by the mass difference @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of this method is discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "the idea of this new method is to use the wrong sign decay @xmath46 followed by @xmath111 , @xmath112 , etc . , and use the possible differences of the resonant substructure between mixing and dcsd to study mixing .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that the resonant substructure of dcsd decay is different from that of mixing ( cabibbo favored decay , cfd ) .",
    "we can use the @xmath111 decay as an example . for cfd and dcsd , the true yield density",
    "@xmath113 at a point @xmath114 in the dalitz plot can be written as : @xmath115 where @xmath116 are the relative amplitudes for each component and @xmath117 are the interference phases between each submode .",
    "@xmath118 is the s - wave three - body decay amplitude , which is flat across the dalitz plot .",
    "the various @xmath119 terms are breit - wigner amplitudes for the @xmath120 and @xmath121 sub - reactions .",
    "note that in general   dcsd decays @xmath122 , while su(6 ) breaking can introduce a sizeable suppression relative to the naive expectation for @xmath3 dcsd decay @xmath123 .",
    "] , @xmath124 @xmath125 this means that the resonant substructure ( the true yield density @xmath113 ) for dcsd is different from that of mixing   ( @xmath126 is the helicity angle of the resonance ) changes sign .",
    "this is the same for both the cabibbo favored decay and the dcsd .",
    "this can be easily seen from the breit - wigner amplitude which describes the strong resonances and decay angular momentum conservation : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the mass and width of the @xmath130 resonance ( the @xmath131 or @xmath60 ) .",
    "the difference between cabibbo favored decay and dcsd comes from the relative amplitude @xmath116 for each submode and the interference phase term @xmath132 . ] .",
    "as both dcsd and mixing contribute to the wrong sign decay , the yield density for the wrong sign events @xmath133 will have a complicated form , due to the fact that for each submode dcsd and mixing may interfere with each other .",
    "just like in method a , for very small mixing , the interference term between dcsd and mixing could be the most important one .    in principle",
    ", one can use the difference between the resonant substructure for dcsd and mixing events to distinguish mixing from dcsd .",
    "for instance , combined with method a , one can perform a multi - dimensional fit to the data by using the information on @xmath134 , @xmath135 , proper decay time @xmath62 and the yield density on dalitz plot @xmath136 .",
    "the extra information on the resonant substructure will , in principle , put a much better constraint on the amount of mixing .",
    "of course , precise knowledge of the resonant substructure for dcsd is needed here and so far we do not know anything about it .",
    "because of this , for current experiments this method is more likely to be a complication rather than a better method when one tries to apply method a to @xmath111 ( see section 3.2 and  @xcite ) or @xmath137 . in principle , however , one can use wrong sign samples at low decay time ( which is almost pure dcsd , see section 2.1.1 . ) to study the resonant substructure of the dcsd decays . in the near future",
    ", we should have a good understanding of dcsd decays and this method could become a feasible way to search for mixing .",
    "this method is to search for dual identical two - body hadronic decays in @xmath138 , such as @xmath139 , as was first suggested by yamamoto in his ph.d thesis  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that when @xmath0 pairs are generated in a state of odd orbital angular momentum ( such as @xmath140 ) , the dcsd contribution to identical two - body pseudo - scalar - vector ( @xmath141 ) and pseudo - scalar - pseudo - scalar ( @xmath142 ) hadronic decays ( such as @xmath139 ) cancels out , leaving only the contribution of mixing  @xcite . as many people have asked about this , i would like to show here the essence of yamamoto s original calculation for the @xmath139 case .",
    "let s define @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 .",
    "a state that is purely @xmath146 or @xmath147 at time @xmath54 will evolve to @xmath148 or @xmath149 at time @xmath62 , with @xmath150 and @xmath151 . in @xmath138 ,",
    "the @xmath0 pair is generated in the state @xmath152 as the relative orbital angular momentum of the pair @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of this state is given by @xmath154 , where @xmath62 ( @xmath155 ) is the time of decay of the @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "now the double - time amplitude @xmath158 that the left side decays to @xmath56 at @xmath62 and the right side decays to @xmath56 at @xmath155 , giving a wrong sign event @xmath139 , is given by : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the amplitude of the cabibbo favored decay @xmath32 , while @xmath161 is the amplitude of dcsd @xmath162 .",
    "similarly , the double - time amplitude @xmath163 for the right sign event @xmath164 is given by : @xmath165 one measures the wrong sign versus right sign ratio @xmath29 , which is : @xmath166 note in taking the ratio , the amplitude term @xmath167 in equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) drop out .",
    "thus , clearly @xmath168 does not depend on whether @xmath169 is zero ( no dcsd ) or finite ( with dcsd ) .",
    "integrating over all times , one then obtains @xmath170 , where @xmath171 and @xmath105 are defined as before .",
    "this is probably the best way to separate dcsd and mixing .",
    "the exclusive nature of the production guarantees both low combinatoric backgrounds and production kinematics essential for background rejection .",
    "this method requires one use @xmath45 annihilation in the charm threshold region . here",
    "the best final state is @xmath139 . in principle",
    ", one can also use final states like @xmath172 or @xmath173 , etc .",
    ", although again there are complications . for example , it is hard to differentiate experimentally @xmath172 from @xmath174 , where dcsd can contribute . with high statistics , in principle , this method could be combined with method b.    it has been pointed out that quantum statistics yield different correlations for the @xmath0 decays from @xmath175  @xcite .",
    "the well - defined coherent quantum states of the @xmath0 can be , in principle , used to provide valuable cross checks on systematic uncertainties and , more importantly , to extract @xmath6 and @xmath176 ( which requires running at different energies ) if mixing is observed  @xcite .",
    "the semi - leptonic method is to search for @xmath177 decays , where there is no dcsd involved .",
    "however , it usually ( not always ! ) suffers from a large background due to the missing neutrino , in addition , the need to understand the large background often introduces model dependence . in the early days",
    ", the small size of fully reconstructed samples of exclusive @xmath3 hadronic decays and the lack of the decay time information made it difficult to constrain the @xmath0 mixing rate using the hadronic method , many experiments used semi - leptonic decays .",
    "the techniques that were used were similar searching for like - sign @xmath178 or @xmath179 pairs in @xmath180  @xcite and @xmath181  @xcite , @xmath182  @xcite .",
    "these techniques rely on the assumptions on production mechanisms , and the accuracy of monte carlo simulations to determine the large conventional sources of background .",
    "there are other ways of using the semi - leptonic method .",
    "the best place to use the semi - leptonic method is probably in @xmath45 annihilation near the charm threshold region .",
    "the idea is to search for @xmath183 @xmath184 or @xmath185  @xcite .",
    "the latter is probably the only place where the semi - leptonic method does not suffer from a large background .",
    "it should have a low background , as there is only one neutrino missing in the entire event , threshold kinematics constraints should provide clean signal .",
    "it has been pointed out that one can not claim a @xmath0 mixing signal based on the semi - leptonic method alone   establishes only that a certain selection rule is violated in processes where the charm quantum number is changed , namely the rule @xmath186 where @xmath187 denotes leptonic charge .",
    "this violation can occur either through @xmath0 mixing ( with the unique attribute of the decay time - dependence of mixing ) , or through new physics beyond the standard model ( which could be independent of time ) . ]",
    "( unless with the information on decay time of @xmath3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can always use this method to set upper limit for mixing .",
    "the mark iii collaboration was the first ( though hopefully not the last ) to use the @xmath138 technique .",
    "they reported preliminary results for two `` wrong - sign '' @xmath3 decay events ( unpublished )  @xcite , one was consistent with @xmath189 vs. @xmath189 , while the other one was consistent with @xmath190 vs. @xmath190 .",
    "this was a very interesting result at that time , and had a strong influence on the subject .",
    "however , one can not draw a firm conclusion about the existence of @xmath0 mixing based on these events",
    ". there are at least two reasons : ( 1 ) the background study has to rely on monte carlo simulation of the pid ( particle identification  time - of - flight ) . as gladding has pointed out : `` these results must be considered preliminary because the calculation of the confidence level is sensitive to the tails of pid distribution for the background ''  @xcite ; ( 2 ) assuming that the monte carlo background study is correct , and that the events are real , one still can not claim the two events are due to mixing , for example , the non - resonant decays @xmath191 may contribute to one side of the pair in each of the events , in which dcsd can contribute .    the mark iii puzzle can be completely solved at a @xmath192-charm factory , which is a high luminosity ( @xmath193 ) @xmath45 storage ring operating at center - of - mass energies in the range 3 - 5 gev . the perspectives for a @xmath0 mixing search at a @xmath192-charm factory have been studied in some detail  @xcite .",
    "i will outline here the most important parts .",
    "the best way to search for mixing is probably to use @xmath194 .",
    "the sensitivity is not hard to estimate . assuming a one year run with a luminosity of @xmath193 , @xmath195 @xmath3s would be produced from @xmath140 .",
    "therefore about @xmath196 @xmath164 events would be produced .",
    "about @xmath197 of them ( @xmath198 ) could be fully reconstructed .",
    "a detailed study has shown that the potential dominant background comes from doubly misidentified @xmath164 , and if tof resolution is 120 ps , this background can be kept to the level of one event or less .",
    "this means one can set an upper limit at the @xmath199 level .",
    "as mentioned section 2.2 , the best place to use the semi - leptonic method is probably at a @xmath192-charm factory .",
    "one good example is to search for @xmath200 @xmath201 .",
    "it is expected that this method can also have a sensitivity at the @xmath199 level .",
    "there are many other independent techniques that one can use for a mixing search at a @xmath192-charm factory . by combining several independent techniques ( which require running at different energies )",
    ", it was claimed that @xmath0 mixing at the @xmath1 level could be observable  @xcite .    there have been several schemes around the world for building a @xmath192-charm factory .",
    "if such a machine is built , it could be a good place to study mixing . at the workshop ,",
    "walter toki told us the history of the @xmath192-charm factory : one was proposed at slac in 1989 and at spain in 1993 .",
    "it was discussed at dubna in 1991 , at ihep ( china ) , and at argonne ( this workshop ) .",
    "it will be discussed again at ihep ( china ) soon .",
    "let us hope that we will have one in the not too distant future .      using the cleo ii data sample , with an integrated luminosity of 1.8 fb@xmath203 at and near the @xmath204(4s ) resonance ,",
    "cleo has observed a signal for @xmath47  @xcite from the decay chain @xmath205 , as can be seen in figure 2 .    without a precision vertex detector ,",
    "cleo ii can only in effect measure the rate @xmath206 integrated over all times of a pure @xmath3 decaying to a final state @xmath207 .",
    "the ratio @xmath29=@xmath208 /@xmath209 is given by integrating equation ( 2 ) over all times :    @xmath210    cleo ii finds @xmath211 .",
    "this signal could mean one of two things : ( 1 ) mixing could be quite large , which would imply that mixing can be observed in the near future ; ( 2 ) the signal is dominated by dcsd .",
    "the theoretical prediction for @xmath212 is about 2 @xmath213  @xcite , which is quite consistent with the measured value .",
    "it is , therefore , believed by many that the signal is due to dcsd , although it remains consistent with the current best experimental upper limits on mixing , which are @xmath214  @xcite and @xmath215  @xcite .",
    "cleo has also tried to use hadronic method b , by searching for @xmath40 .",
    "the excellent photon detection at cleo ii allows one to study this mode with a sensitivity close to @xmath34 mode .",
    "the main complication faced here is that ( as discussed in section 2.1.2 ) the resonant substructure is not necessarily the same for wrong sign and right sign decays .",
    "because of this , the interpretation of @xmath29 as @xmath216 or @xmath212 will be complicated by the lack of knowledge of the details of the interference between submodes ( and also the decay time information ) .",
    "moreover , one has to worry about the detection efficiency across the dalitz plot .",
    "setting an upper limit for each submode is clearly very difficult .",
    "cleo has thus set an upper limit on the inclusive rate for @xmath40 as @xmath29 = @xmath217 /@xmath218 @xmath219  @xcite .",
    "note this upper limit includes the possible effects of the interference between the dcsd and mixing for each submode as well as the interference between submodes .",
    "this summer , cleo will install a silicon vertex detector ( svx ) with a longitudinal resolution on vertex separation around 75 @xmath220 .",
    "this will enable cleo to measure the decay time of the @xmath3 , and reduce the random slow pion background ( as the resolution of the @xmath49 - @xmath3 mass difference is dominated by the angular resolution on the slow pion , this should be greatly improved by the use of the svx ) . by the year 2000 , with cleo iii ( a symmetric b factory ) and asymmetric b factories at slac and kek , each should have about thousands @xmath221 and a few hundred @xmath34 ( and perhaps @xmath40 , @xmath112 too ) signal events with decay time information for one year of running .",
    "the typical decay length of @xmath3 ( @xmath222 ) is about a few hundred @xmath220 , and the resolution of the decay length ( @xmath223 ) is about 80 @xmath220 ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "the sensitivity to mixing at cleo iii and asymmetric b factory has not been carefully studied yet .",
    "a reasonable guess is that it could be as low as @xmath199 .",
    "if mixing is indeed as large as dcsd , it should be observed by then .",
    "a significant amount of our knowledge has been gained from fermilab fixed target experiments , and in fact the current best upper limits on mixing have emerged from these experiments ( e615 , e691 ) , and will come from their successors e687 , e791 and e831 soon .",
    "the best upper limit using the semi - leptonic method comes from the fermilab experiment e615 , which used a 255 gev pion beam on a tungsten target .",
    "the technique is to search for the reaction @xmath225",
    "@xmath226 @xmath227 , where only the final state muons are detected ( like sign @xmath178 or @xmath179 pairs ) .",
    "assuming @xmath228 nuclear dependence , they obtained @xmath229  @xcite .",
    "the best upper limit using the hadronic method by measuring the decay time information comes from e691 , which is the first high statistics fixed target ( photoproduction ) experiment .",
    "in fact , e691 was the first experiment which used the decay time information ( obtained from the excellent decay time resolution of their silicon detectors ) to distinguish dcsd and mixing .",
    "the decay chains @xmath46 followed by @xmath47 , @xmath230 were used .",
    "the upper limits from the @xmath34 mode are @xmath231 and @xmath232 , while the upper limits from @xmath41 are @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "the combined result gives @xmath235 .",
    "the ranges above reflect the possible effects of interference between dcsd and mixing with an unknown phase(@xmath58 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath137 , the resonant substructure in the cabibbo favored and dcsd decays has been ignored .    at this workshop , both e687 and e791 have reported their preliminary result from part of their data .",
    "one can find the details in jim wiss s talk .",
    "the best upper limits on mixing should come from these two experiments soon .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that both the e687 and e791 results reported in the workshop are based on the assumption that there is no interference between dcsd and mixing .",
    "future analysis should include the interference term for the reasons discussed in section 2.1.1 .",
    "this measurement requires : ( 1 ) excellent vertexing capabilities , at least good enough to see the interference structure ; ( 2 ) low background around the primary vertex .",
    "the background level around the primary vertex could be an important issue as the interference term in equation ( 2 ) does peak at @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , low background around primary vertex means that one does not suffer much from random slow pion background and also one can measure the dcsd component at low decay time well .",
    "this is important for understanding dcsd at large decay times .",
    "the vertexing capabilities at @xmath45 experiments ( @xmath236 ) for cleo iii and asymmetric b factories at slac and kek should be sufficient for a mixing search . the extra path - length due to the lorentz boost , together with the use of silicon detectors for high resolution position measurements ,",
    "have given the fixed target experiments an advantage over @xmath45 experiments ( @xmath237 ) . the low background around the primary vertex at @xmath45 experiments and photoproduction experiments is a certain advantage .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that at the @xmath45 experiments ( esp . at",
    "asymmetric b factory or z factory ) it maybe possible to use @xmath238 , where the primary ( @xmath49 decay ) vertex can be determined by the @xmath239 together with the slow pion coming from the @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", the background level around the primary vertex is intrinsically very low .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath39 , etc . , the requirement on the background level around the primary vertex is not so important . in this case , the mixing signature is not a deviation from a perfect exponential ( again assuming cp conservation ) , but rather a deviation of the slope from @xmath102 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that there are many advantages with this method .",
    "for example , one can use cabibbo favored decay modes , such as @xmath32 , to measure the average @xmath3 decay rate @xmath102 .",
    "this , along with other scsd cp even ( or odd ) final states , would allow for valuable cross checks on systematics uncertainties .",
    "in addition , since we only need to determine the slope here , we do not need to tag the @xmath3 nor know the primary vertex location .",
    "the sensitivity of this method depends on how well we can dertermine the slope . roughly speaking , in the ideal case , the sensitivity to @xmath105 would be @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the number of @xmath242 , etc . events , which means that the sensitivity to mixing caused by the decay rate difference ( @xmath243 ) would be close to @xmath244 .",
    "for example , a fixed - target experiment capable of producing @xmath245 reconstructed charm events could lower the sensitivity   to @xmath246 level for the @xmath247 term in @xmath248 .      in the near future",
    ", we should be able to have a good understanding of dcsd   dcsd decays where the signature is not confused by a mixing component .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the @xmath249 dcsd decays can be studied very well at future fixed target experiments . ] in @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc .",
    "modes , then method b will become a feasible way to study mixing and the sensitivity should be improved .",
    "just like method a , this method requires very good vertexing capabilities and very low background around the primary vertex ( this is even more important than in method a , since precise knowledge of dcsd is very important here ) .",
    "in addition , this method requires that the detection efficiency ( for the mode being searched ) across dalitz plot be quite uniform ( at least the detector should have good acceptance on the dalitz plot at locations where dcsd and mixing resonant substructure are different ) .",
    "this is necessary so that detailed information on the resonant substructure can be obtained in every corner on the dalitz plot .",
    "the excellent photon detection capabilities will allow @xmath45 experiments to study the @xmath40 mode with very low background . from the cleo ii",
    "@xmath40 analysis , the detection efficiency across the dalitz plot will have some variations due to cuts needed to reduce background , however , it is still good enough to obtain detailed information on the resonant substructure  @xcite .",
    "future fixed target experiments may have a good chance to study @xmath41 mode , since the detection efficiency across dalitz plot should be quite flat .",
    "the sensitivity that each experiment can reach by using this method depends on many things and need to be carefully studied in the future .",
    "the sensitivity of this method depends crucially on the particle identification capabilities .",
    "since the @xmath3 is at rest , the @xmath250 and @xmath251 mesons will have the same momentum , so a doubly misidentified cabibbo favored decay @xmath32 ( @xmath252 ) mimics a @xmath34 with almost the same @xmath3 mass .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that particle identification is not as crucial to method a as it is to this method ( c ) , as far as this particular background is concerned . this is because in method a",
    ", the @xmath3 is highly boosted , and doubly misidentified @xmath34 decays will have a broad distribution in the @xmath3 mass spectrum around the @xmath3 mass peak ; this background can be kinematically rejected with only a small reduction of the efficiency for the signal events   candidates , one can invert the kaon and pion assignments and recalculate the @xmath3 mass , denoted @xmath253 . if @xmath253 lies close to the nominal @xmath3 mass ,",
    "the combination is discarded .",
    "this veto works as long as the momentum measurement is correct .",
    "one can say that excellent tracking capabilities is crucial in order to get rid of this background here . ] .    once the sensitivity reaches @xmath254 , one may have to worry about other contributions , such as contributions from continuum background , contributions from @xmath255 which may produce c - even states where dcsd can contribute  @xcite .",
    "the semi - leptonic method usually suffers from large background ( except at a @xmath192 charm factory ) , the traditional method of looking for like sign @xmath178 or @xmath179 pairs is an example .",
    "new ideas are needed in order to improve the sensitivity significantly .",
    "some promising techniques have been suggested by rolly morrison and others , and have been discussed in the working group  @xcite .",
    "the search for @xmath0 mixing carries a large discovery potential for new physics since the @xmath0 mixing rate is expected to be very small in the standard model .",
    "the past decade has seen significant experimental progress in sensitivity ( from 20% down to 0.37% ) . in light of the recent cleo ii signal in @xmath34 , if the mixing rate is close to that of dcsd ( above @xmath199 ) , then it might be observed by the year 2000 with either the hadronic or the semi - leptonic method , either at fixed target experiments , cleo iii , asymmetric b factories(at slac and kek ) , or at a @xmath192-charm factory .",
    "if the mixing rate is indeed much smaller than dcsd , then the hadronic method may have a better chance as the potentially very small mixing signature could be enhanced by the presence of the relatively large `` annoying background '' dcsd .",
    "the design of future experiments should focus on improving the vertexing capabilities and reducing the background level around the primary vertex , in order to fully take advantage of having the possible dcsd interference .",
    "in addition , the very complication due to the possible differences between the resonant substructure in many dcsd and mixing decay modes @xmath256 could in principle be turned to advantage by providing additional information once the substructure in dcsd is understood ( method b ) and the sensitivity could be improved significantly this way .",
    "this means that understanding dcsd in @xmath156 decays could be a very important step on the way to observe mixing .",
    "experimenters and theorists should work hard on this .    in the case of @xmath256 and @xmath257",
    ", we are only measuring @xmath16 . since many extensions of the standard model",
    "predict large @xmath6 , it is very important to measure @xmath171 and @xmath105 separately .",
    "fortunately , scsd can provide us information on @xmath105 .",
    "this is due to the fact that decays such as @xmath39 , occur only through definte cp eigenstate , and this fact can be used to measure the decay rate difference @xmath104 alone .",
    "observation of a non - zero @xmath105 would demonstrate mixing caused by the decay rate difference .",
    "this , together with the information on @xmath22 obtained from other methods , we can in effect measure @xmath171 . in this sense",
    ", it is best to think of the quest to observe mixing ( new physics ) as a program rather than a single effort .",
    "much of my knowledge on this subject has been gained by having worked closely with hitoshi yamamoto over the past three years , i would like to express my sincere gratitude to him . besides",
    ", i would like to express special thanks to rolly morrison for many useful and stimulating discussions , to richard wilson for encouragement and careful reading of the draft , to gary gladding , tom browder and milind purohit for helping me to understand the details of mark iii , e691 and e791 analysis ( respectively ) , to dan kim who made figure 1 .",
