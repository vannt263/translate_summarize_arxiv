    "high - z grbs offer the potential to probe the early universe into the epoch of re - ionization . in big bang cosmology ,",
    "the universe went through a `` dark age '' when matter had cooled below @xmath0kelvin and became neutral .",
    "re - ionization of matter occurred once bodies such as quasars started radiating , initiating the ionization of neutral matter , producing an ionized plasma .",
    "bodies we see now with a red - shift @xmath1 ( 150 million to one billion years after the big bang )  @xcite emitted their radiation in this re - ionization period .",
    "( the highest - z grb detected thus far is z=6.29  @xcite . )",
    "high - z grbs also have the potential to trace the star formation rate and metallicity histories of the universe  @xcite .",
    "moreover , grbs are 100 - 1000 times brighter at early times than are high red - shift quasars .",
    "grbs are expected to occur out to z @xmath2 10 , whereas the distribution of quasars drops significantly beyond z=3 .",
    "another benefit is that due to the relatively clean neighborhoods of grb progenitors , grb afterglow have simple power - law spectra with no emission lines .",
    "thus grbs are clean probes of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , whereas quasars are contaminated by continuous material emission from the central engine to the quasar s neighborhood .",
    "high - z grb studies will probe the igm less than 1 gyr after the big bang . in this respect ,",
    "the study of high - z grbs provide a unique method to probe the early universe .",
    "clearly , detecting high - z grbs is very important for probing the early universe .",
    "currently , a significant number of grbs with redshifts around @xmath3 have been observed , but only a handful of events for redshifts greater than @xmath4 to help identify new grbs with high - z , we have developed an early - stage observational filter on bursts , so that follow - up ground based observatories can be notified , and they can subsequently attempt to get optical red - shift measurements for these candidate high - z objects .",
    "our observational filter for candidate high - z grbs is a set of screening criteria , taking advantage of some prompt - emission properties of grbs which are analyzable within a few hours after the burst .",
    "we have found trends between some observational characteristics in the prompt emission from observed grbs and their corresponding redshifts ( @xmath5 ) :    \\1 .",
    "the temporal period t90 , normalized by the peak photon flux ( see fig .  [ fig01 ] ) ;    \\2 . the normalized light curve variance ( using t100 duration )",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) ;    \\3 . the peak photon flux ( fig .  [ fig03 ] ) ;    \\4 .",
    "the photon index derived from the simple power law fit to the burst spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] ) .",
    "each characteristic is not sufficiently discriminatory to screen for high - z grbs by their own .",
    "however , the combined cuts on these properties enable us to filter out high - z bursts with significant probability .    ]",
    "using trends in pulse width , variance , peak flux , and photon power law , we have formulated automated screening criteria to identify possible high - z grbs by utilizing the prompt emission properties of grbs within a few hours after the burst .",
    "this will enable more intense ground - based observational campaigns for measuring red - shifts of the detected grbs .    with the limited available sample of grbs having known high - z , the probability of a grb being selected by our criteria with a redshift @xmath6 5.0 is 45 % , with a redshift @xmath6 4.0",
    "is 67 % and with a redshift @xmath6 3.5 is 89 % ( table  [ tab : a ] ) . based on an analysis of swift existing burst data",
    ", the criteria we used will generate an alert once a month on average .",
    "currently , our screening criteria are implemented in automated scripts and running in real time .",
    "our filter for high - z has already generated alerts on grb 071021 ( gcn 6967 ) , grb 071118 ( gcn 7109 ) and grb 071129 ( gcn 7139 ) , which enhanced ground based follow - up observations .",
