    "recent studies , including strong coupling corrections to the string effective action , have provided the pre - big bang scenario @xcite with a number of promising models for the transition from the growing to the decreasing curvature regime @xcite . however , a crucial question remains : is it possible to test this cosmological scenario and , in particular , to distinguish it from other , more conventional descriptions of the very early universe ?",
    "the answer to this essential question is in principle positive , since the pre - big bang scenario incorporates a dilaton field which modifies the standard inflationary kinematics and which , through its non - minimal coupling , also directly modifies the evolution of perturbations ( of the metric , and of the other background fields ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known , on the other hand , that the transition from an inflationary period to the usual friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) phase amplifies tensor metric perturbations , and is associated with the production of a stochastic background of relic gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "such a primordial background decouples from matter immediately below the planck scale , unlike the electromagnetic radiation which underwent a complicated history until recombination , and has been transmitted almost unperturbed down to our present epoch . as a consequence",
    ", its present spectrum should be a faithful portrait of the very early universe @xcite , thus opening a window for the observation of processes occurring near to the planck scale , and for discriminating among various models of primordial evolution .    in the context of string cosmology",
    ", several mechanisms may contribute to the generation of gravitational waves from the initial vacuum state .",
    "one contribution comes from the process of dynamical dimensional reduction @xcite , when the internal dimensions shrink down to a final compactification scale .",
    "another contribution is due to the time - dependence of the dilaton field  and thus of the effective gravitational coupling constant  during the pre - big bang phase @xcite .",
    "finally , there is the usual contribution arising from the accelerated expansion of the external three - dimensional space .",
    "both the dilaton and the full , higher - dimensional metric thus contribute to the external  pump \" field which is responsible for the parametric amplification of tensor metric fluctuations , normalised to an initial vacuum fluctuation spectrum .    with respect to the standard inflationary scenario ,",
    "the amplification of tensor perturbations in the pre - big bang scenario is strongly enhanced for large comoving wavenumber @xmath0 @xcite , in such a way that the produced background of gravitational waves could in principle be detected in the near future by various planned experiments @xcite .",
    "arguments in favour of this conclusion arise from the particular kinematics of string cosmology .",
    "first , since the hubble parameter is increasing in the pre - big bang phase , higher frequency modes will cross the horizon at higher values of @xmath1 , which implies that the amplitude of the spectrum increases with frequency . in this context",
    ", the comoving amplitude of perturbations may grow even outside the horizon @xcite , instead of being frozen as happens in standard inflation .",
    "second , the peak amplitude of the spectrum ( naturally located in the high frequency regime , near the end point of the spectrum ) is normalised so as to match the string scale @xcite , i.e. nearly eight orders of magnitude above the high frequency normalisation of the standard scenario @xcite .",
    "hence , the pre - big bang phase could lead to a very efficient production of gravitons in the sensitivity range of present gravitational antenna .",
    "in fact such a relic background could be in principle be detected by the second ( planned ) generation of interferometric detectors @xcite .",
    "to date , extended studies of tensor perturbations have been mostly performed in the context of the tree - level effective action , with and without the possible contribution of a high curvature stringy phase . in all cases",
    "the background cosmologies that have been investigated have been singular , i.e. the curvature and dilaton have become singular at some fixed proper time .",
    "there have been a number of suggested ways to tackle the singularity problem , considering also anisotropic @xcite and inhomogeneous @xcite backgrounds , or the presence of a non - local dilaton potential @xcite .",
    "however , if we confine our attention to homogeneous and isotropic metrics , and to a local potential , one of the most promising approaches to the graceful exit problem @xcite suggests that the curvature singularities may be cured by adding higher - order corrections to the string effective action ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "these include both higher - derivative @xmath2 corrections , due to finite - size effects , and quantum corrections , due to the loop expansion in the string coupling parameter . in the context of cosmological perturbation theory ,",
    "it is known @xcite that such corrections may induce an additional amplification when the curvature becomes large in string units .",
    "the aim of this paper , therefore , is to discuss the evolution and the spectrum of tensor perturbations in the context of a class of non - singular cosmological backgrounds , by taking into account ( in the perturbation equation ) the full contribution of those corrections that are responsible for the regularisation of the background evolution . in this way it will be possible ( for the first time , to the best of our knowledge ) to follow the complete evolution of perturbations , from the initial vacuum down to the present time , through a continuous numerical integration of the linearised perturbation equations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the general form of the first order @xmath2 corrections arising in the context of the massless bosonic sector of the low - energy heterotic string action .",
    "we extend them by including possible one- and two - loop quantum corrections , and we write down the corresponding background equations . in section 3 we compute the linearised tensor perturbation equation , including such higher - order corrections . in section 4",
    "we present a general discussion of the evolution of perturbations in the presence of higher - order curvature corrections .",
    "we then check the main points of our discussion through a numerical integration of the perturbation equations for regular backgrounds , by using an appropriate dilaton potential , or particle production effects , to stabilise the dilaton in the post - big bang era .",
    "we find that the general effect of the higher - order corrections is to flatten the slope of the high - frequency part of the spectrum , but the effect is probably too small  in the class of models discussed in this paper  to make the graviton background  visible \" to the planned advanced detectors .",
    "the main results of this paper are finally summarised in section 5 .",
    "in the context of the pre - big bang scenario , our present frw universe is expected to emerge from the string perturbative vacuum as a consequence of some process  for instance , plane wave collisions @xcite  triggering the gravitational collapse of a sufficiently large portion of spacetime @xcite .",
    "the initial evolution is driven by the kinetic energy of the dilaton , and can be described , in the string frame , as inflationary expansion with growing coupling and curvature . after reaching a maximal scale controlled by the fundamental string length @xmath3 , @xmath4 , it is then expected that the universe is smoothly connected to the frw regime , with a constant dilaton field .    in the early stage of the dilaton - driven inflationary ( ddi )",
    "period , strings are propagating in a background of small curvature , and the fields are weakly coupled , so that the cosmological evolution is consistently described by the lowest order string effective action which , by assuming static internal dimensions , can be written as : @xmath5 + { \\cal l}_{c } \\right\\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath6 , we have adopted the convention @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and set our units such that @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite , we have introduced an additional lagrangian @xmath11 allowing for the inclusion of higher - order corrections to the tree - level effective action , a non - perturbative potential  yet to be determined  and/or the backreaction of the produced radiation .",
    "considering this additional lagrangian as an independent source we shall assume that the associated energy - momentum tensor is diagonal , homogeneous and isotropic , and can be written in the perfect fluid form as @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting equations of motion for the background are obtained from the variation of eq .",
    "( [ e : low ] ) with respect to the metric and the dilaton field : @xmath13 a dot represents the differentiation with respect to proper time @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the hubble parameter .",
    "@xmath16 arises from the variation of the additional lagrangian with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "finally , eq .  ( [ e : e_constraint ] ) is the conservation equation , a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ e : eq_rho])eq .",
    "( [ e : eq_phi ] ) .    to lowest order , the homogeneous and isotropic version of the pre - big bang scenario , without non - local dilaton potential , inevitably faces a curvature and dilaton singularity at the end of the ddi phase .",
    "however , a singular behaviour is often a late manifestation of the breakdown of the description , extended beyond its domain of validity .",
    "hence , the low - energy dynamics should be supplemented by corrections , in order to give a reliable description of the high curvature regime , expected to be crossed before reaching the frw universe .",
    "such corrections are generally of two types : tree - level @xmath2 corrections , referring to the finite size of the string , and quantum corrections , resulting from a more conventional loop expansion in the string coupling parameter .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the higher curvature @xmath2 terms , arising from the expansion around the point - particle limit , may eventually stabilise the evolution of the universe into a de - sitter like regime of constant curvature @xmath18 and linearly growing ( in cosmic time ) dilaton . in this paper",
    "we will consider the most general tree - level @xmath2 corrections to the gravi - dilaton string action up to fourth - order in derivatives ( see @xcite for a detailed analysis ) , which can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath19 @xmath20 the constraint eq .",
    "( [ e : constraint ] ) on the coefficients is required so that the action reproduces the usual string scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 allows us to move between different string models , and we will later use @xmath22 to agree with previous studies of the heterotic string @xcite . finally , @xmath23 is the gauss - bonnet combination , guaranteeing the absence of derivatives higher than two in the equations of motion .",
    "another conventional expansion of the string effective action is controlled by the string coupling parameter , @xmath24 .",
    "initially , @xmath25 .",
    "however , the growth of the dilaton during the ddi era implies that the late evolution of the background could be dominated by quantum loop corrections , which will eventually force the universe to escape from the fixed point determined by the @xmath2 corrections @xcite , for a smooth connection to the post - big bang regime .",
    "unfortunately , there is as yet no definitive calculation of the full loop expansion in string theory , so we are left to speculate on plausible terms that will eventually make up the loop contribution .",
    "multiplying each term of the tree - level @xmath2 correction by a suitable power of the string coupling is the approach which has already met with some success @xcite , and which we shall adopt also in this paper .",
    "since the quantum corrections are not formally derived from an explicit computation , we shall allow for different coefficients @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) at one - loop ( two - loop ) in the string coupling , replacing the coefficients @xmath28 of the tree - level action , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are not necessarily subject to the constraint eq .",

    "( [ e : class ] ) , with the constant parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 actually controlling the onset of the loop corrections .",
    "the very similarity between the first order @xmath2 and loop corrections enables a simple form for their contributions to the background equations of motion . from now on ,",
    "we introduce an additional parameter @xmath34 in the exponential of the correction @xmath11 , such that @xmath2 corrections correspond to @xmath35 , whereas one- or two - loop corrections correspond to @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",

    ", the influence of the higher - order corrections on tensor perturbations is more dramatic , and the corresponding slope may be much flatter than the one of the preceding string phase .    in summary , the results of this paper agree with the general expectation that the shape of the spectrum of the relic graviton background , obtained in the context of the pre - big bang scenario , is strongly model - dependent .",
    "however , it turns out that the formulation of a complete and consistent regular scenario , associated to a  visible \" graviton spectrum , may be more difficult than previously expected  at least within a truncated perturbative approach , like the one adopted in this paper .",
