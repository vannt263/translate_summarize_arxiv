    "the coupling constants @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 are important ingredients for the theoretical analysis of many different hadronic electromagnetic processes . if @xmath10 , the decays @xmath11 can occur directly - with radiation of electric dipole photons .",
    "in this respect , these decays are essentially different from the decays @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 -with radiation of magnetic dipole photons . in the quark models , these last decays are induced by the quark magnetic moment , with transition @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total spin of the @xmath18-system ( in the corresponding meson ) , whereas the decays @xmath19 are induced by the internal motion of quarks , with transition @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "let us mention the main applications of the @xmath7-coupling constants :    * the @xmath21-exchange for the vector meson production @xcite @xmath4 , near threshold . *",
    "the electromagnetic transition @xmath22 , in the space - like region of the virtual photon @xmath23four - momenta , enters in the calculation of meson exchange currents , in particular in the analysis of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors at large momentum transfer @xcite . *",
    "the branching ratio of rare radiative decays of vector mesons as @xmath24 and @xmath25 are controlled by the @xmath7-coupling constants @xcite .",
    "* the hermes effect @xcite , concerning the inclusive electroproduction cross section on light nuclei can be explained under specific assumptions @xcite about the absolute value of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 coupling constants and the corresponding electromagnetic form factors . *",
    "the coupling constant of the @xmath28-vertex , which can be calculated on the basis of the @xmath7 couplings , is important for the analysis of real and virtual compton scattering on nucleons @xcite . *",
    "the exact value of the @xmath7 coupling constant , in principle , allows one to constrain the @xmath29-coupling , which describes the scalar exchange in the @xmath30-potential @xcite .",
    "* finally , the @xmath7 coupling constants have an implicit theoretical interest , being fundamental coupling constants of hadron electrodynamics .",
    "attempts to estimate these coupling constants from @xmath31-sum rules , give relatively large absolute values @xcite .",
    "phenomenological methods based on the existing experimental data about different electromagnetic processes need serious additional assumptions .",
    "for example , in the framework of @xmath21-exchange for @xmath4 , it is possible to estimate the product @xmath32 , assuming a definite form of the phenomenological form factors , which insure the correct behavior of the differential cross section @xmath33 , in the near - threshold region , and depend on ad - hoc cut - off parameters .",
    "taking @xmath34 , one obtains @xmath35 @xcite . considering only @xmath21-exchange in @xmath4 ,",
    "the sign of this constant can not be determined , but some polarization observables are sensitive to this sign @xcite .",
    "other possible contributions to the matrix element for the process @xmath4 , such as @xmath36-excitation , @xmath37-exchange in @xmath38- and @xmath39-channel are neglected in such oversimplified consideration @xcite .",
    "also the estimation of the discussed coupling constants done in framework of the hermes effect @xcite can not be considered as direct and model independent .",
    "another source of information about the @xmath40-vertex is the radiative decay @xmath41-with relatively large branching ratio @xcite .",
    "namely this decay has been considered to favor large values of @xmath26 in comparison with @xmath27 , because of the corresponding widths @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "however it is necessary to point out that for the decay @xmath41 the bremsstrahlung mechanism dominates , therefore the @xmath21-contribution , being of the order of the error bars , can not give the @xmath26 with good accuracy . note also that the precise determination of @xmath26 depends essentially on the mass and the width of the @xmath21-meson . in @xcite",
    "different values of @xmath26 could been found , with the general conclusion that the @xmath26 value from @xmath41 is not in contradiction with the estimation done in @xcite .",
    "finally , having a definite value of @xmath26 , it is possible to estimate the branching ratio for @xmath43 , in framework of the effective lagrangian approach . in this case , the absence of the bremsstrahlung mechanism results in the fact that the @xmath21-exchange mechanism is important .",
    "but the predicted @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , were too large in comparison with other theoretical expectations for this decay @xcite .",
    "moreover , and this will be the important background of this paper , large values of @xmath26 contradict essentially the recent experimental results from novosibirsk , concerning the direct measurement of the decay @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath46 @xmath47    the main aim of this paper is to estimate the coupling constant @xmath26 on the basis of these new important experimental data , which is , in our opinion , the most straightforward way .",
    "a crude estimation of the @xmath26 coupling constant can be easily obtained from the experimental data about @xmath49 @xcite , under the assumption that the @xmath21-mass is smaller than the @xmath50-meson mass , so that the decay @xmath51 is allowed .    neglecting for a moment the @xmath21-width ( which is an evident oversimplification of reality , as @xmath52 gev @xcite )",
    ", we can find : @xmath53 taking into account the identity of the neutral @xmath54-mesons , produced in @xmath1 , and the isotopic relation : @xmath55 .",
    "the matrix element of the decay @xmath19 can be written in the following form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the four - vectors describing the vector polarization ( four - momenta ) of the photon and of the @xmath59meson .",
    "averaging over the @xmath3-meson polarizations and summing over the photon polarizations , one can find for the width of the decay @xmath19 ( still considering the @xmath21-meson as a stable particle ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass of the @xmath62-meson . the numerical estimation ( [ eq : eq3 ] )",
    "is done for m=0.77 gev ( @xmath50-meson ) .",
    "evidently , at a given value of the @xmath63-coupling constant , the value of @xmath64 depends essentially on the value taken for the @xmath21-meson mass , which can be in a wide range : @xmath65 gev @xcite . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we report the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , calculated for the values of the @xmath68-constant and @xmath69 from refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such estimations for @xmath67 are almost two orders of magnitude larger than the value given by the experiment @xcite : @xmath70    note that the predictions of qcd sum rules @xcite are also in serious disagreement with the direct experimental estimation ( [ eq : eq5c ] ) .",

    "therefore let us estimate more precisely the @xmath26 coupling constant on the basis of the decay @xmath75 , removing the hypothesis taken above , i.e. taking into account the finite value of the @xmath21-width , and the possibility that in some cases it is possible to have @xmath76 .",
    "considering the sequence of decays @xmath77 , one can find , for the effective @xmath78-mass distribution , the following formula ( see appendix ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the total width for the @xmath21-meson , and : @xmath81 for the estimation of the coupling constant @xmath82 on the basis of @xmath83 the following formula can be used : @xmath84 with @xmath85 using the experimental information for the branching ratio for the radiative decay @xmath86 @xcite , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq8 ] ) , one can deduce the constant @xmath26 as a function of the @xmath21-meson parameters , its mass and its width ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "one can see a strong dependence of the value of @xmath26 on the two coordinates @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which vary in the wide interval suggested by @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the whole region of parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 one can see that @xmath89 ; for example , for @xmath90 gev and @xmath91 gev , we find @xmath92 .",
    "another source for an independent estimation of the @xmath26 coupling constant , which confirms our previous finding , is the radiative decay @xmath94 . in principle",
    "it is possible to estimate the width of this decay analyzing the @xmath21-contribution in the amplitude of the elastic scattering of photons by nucleons , in the framework of the @xmath95channel exchange , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a , or in the two - photon production of a @xmath96 or @xmath97-pair in @xmath98-collisions , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b , in the corresponding region of the @xmath99-effective mass @xcite .    following the vdm approach , ( fig . [ fig : fig3 ] ) ,",
    "the matrix element for @xmath94 can be written in terms of the @xmath7 coupling constants , as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the three - vectors of polarization for the two produced photons .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath103 determines the width of the @xmath3-meson leptonic decay @xmath104 ( through one - photon exchange ) : @xmath105 .",
    "note that this formula holds for zero lepton mass .",
    "the existing data about @xmath106 decays @xcite allow to estimate @xmath107 and @xmath108 with good accuracy : @xmath109 .    as both couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27 enter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq9 ] ) , we assume , for simplicity , the validity of the @xmath110 relation : @xmath111 . the width @xmath112 can be written as : @xmath113 taking @xmath114 @xcite , one finds @xmath115 the same or even larger numbers for @xmath112 follow from the qcd - sum rule estimation for @xmath26 @xcite or from the value deduced from the analysis of @xmath41-decays @xcite .",
    "these numbers contradict the corresponding experimental estimations : @xmath116 and , again , the discrepancy is large , up to one order magnitude .",
    "the situation is even worse , taking the value of @xmath68 from ref .",
    "@xcite , which leads to @xmath117    on the other hand , taking the experimental data about the @xmath94-decay , ( [ eq : eq14 ] ) , one can deduce directly a value @xmath118 in evident contradiction with the previous large @xmath68 values @xcite , but in good agreement with the present estimation , based on the new data about the decay @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the possible consequences of a smaller value of the @xmath26 coupling constant ; more precisely , let us consider the case @xmath119 . here",
    "this range is derived from two independent sources : the radiative decay of the @xmath120-meson , @xmath86 , on one side , and the radiative decay of the @xmath21-meson : @xmath94 , from another side .",
    "both these decays can be described in a relative simple and transparent theoretical framework : the @xmath21-dominance for the first one and the vdm approach for the second one .",
    "note that the vdm model gives a good description of the different numerous radiative decays involving vector and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( for the @xmath121-transition ) , which enter in our consideration of the decay @xmath94 , are well known from the experimental data about the decays @xmath122 , which have quite good accuracy .",
    "therefore , the main uncertainty in the determination of @xmath26 on the basis of the existing data on @xmath94 , derives from the relatively large interval for @xmath123 .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath21-meson also do not affect very much this estimation : there is no dependence on the @xmath21-width , and only a cubic dependence on the @xmath124meson mass , so that : @xmath125 where@xmath126 is the value of the considered coupling constant for @xmath69=1 gev . from this scaling law",
    "it follows the @xmath26 constant gets smaller for higher @xmath21-masses .",
    "the estimation of @xmath127 on the basis of the decay @xmath77 depends essentially on the mass and width of the @xmath21-meson , only , without additional unknown coupling constants .",
    "we can build a two - dimensional representation on @xmath127 , with non trivial dependence on @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "it turns out that , for the standard value @xmath128 = 0.5 gev , in the interval @xmath130 gev , one has the following limits : @xmath131 definitely smaller than the values used in @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interval ( [ eq : eq18 ] ) is in agreement with the interval ( [ eq : eq16 ] ) .",
    "we must stress that the value @xmath132 in the consideration of the process @xmath4 @xcite , has been found for @xmath69=0.5 gev , which has been chosen quite arbitrarily . the @xmath21-exchange amplitude and the corresponding estimation of @xmath26 depend essentially on @xmath69 .",
    "for example , in the near - threshold conditions for @xmath4 , another scaling law holds for @xmath26 : @xmath133 where @xmath134 0.32 gev@xmath135 ( @xmath136 is the nucleon mass ) .",
    "this relation shows a large correlation between @xmath26 deduced from the data about @xmath4 and the @xmath21-mass , in such a way that larger value of @xmath69 correspond to larger value of the coupling constant .",
    "moreover , the differential cross section for @xmath4 , calculated in framework of @xmath21-exchange , contains a strong dependence on the @xmath21-mass , through the phenomenological form factor , which has to be introduced here to improve the @xmath95behavior of the differential cross section @xmath137 at large @xmath138 . to deduce a definite value of the @xmath26 coupling constant from a fit of the differential cross section data , it is also necessary to assume a definite value for the @xmath139-coupling .",
    "typically this value is determined from the @xmath30-potential .",
    "the estimation of @xmath26 from the data about @xmath140 , which suggests the large value : @xmath141 , can not be considered very precise , as the possible @xmath21-exchange is hidden by the large contribution of bremsstrahlung ( photon radiation by charged pions ) .",
    "therefore the coupling @xmath26 derived by this decay , results in a very large width for @xmath142 , in strong contradiction with the experiment and and with the other theoretical estimations of this width .",
    "the hermes - effect can not be considered a reliable source of information about the @xmath26-coupling constant .",
    "it is more correct to say , that , in order to explain this effect in the framework of the model @xcite , one needs large values , which are difficult to justify on the basis of what is known from the radiative decays @xmath143 .",
    "for example , the large value of @xmath27 was justified in @xcite by taking the lower limit for @xmath144 from @xcite , instead of a much smaller and more precise value from @xmath0 . following selection rules ,",
    "the relation @xmath145 @xcite is correct independently on the decay mechanism .",
    "one deduces , for @xmath27 , a value which is two orders of magnitude lower then in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if the small values for the @xmath26-coupling constant , as we suggest in the present paper are correct , the interpretation of the following different electromagnetic processes has to be revised :    * the explanation of the near - threshold cross section for @xmath4 in frame of the @xmath21-model can not work , because the @xmath21-contribution has to be small .",
    "the @xmath21-contribution , taking @xmath119 , turns out to be one order of magnitude smaller than necessary for the explanation of the existing data . in principle",
    ", one can recover by increasing correspondingly the @xmath29-coupling constant , but this would seriously modify the @xmath30-potential . moreover , such increase would change the scale of the @xmath21-contribution to the differential cross section of @xmath146 , in the near threshold region , making the @xmath21 and @xmath147-exchanges of the same order .",
    "so other contributions , such as pomeron and ( or ) @xmath148-exchanges , which have been extrapolated up to threshold , have to be taken into account .",
    "this allows to decrease @xmath26 up to unity @xcite .",
    "* the explanation of the hermes effect , in terms of coherent contribution of mesons , does not hold anymore .",
    "* the predictions of these constants in the framework of the @xmath31-sum rules do not hold .",
    "we thank j. m. laget for useful discussions on the problem of the @xmath26-coupling constant in different electromagnetic processes .",
    "one of us ( m.p.r . ) acknowledges the kind hospitality of saclay , where this work was completed .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the effect of the @xmath21-width on the decay @xmath149 .    the matrix element , corresponding to this diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) can be written as : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the matrix element for the decay @xmath152 , with production of a virtual @xmath21-meson , which mass @xmath153 ( different from the mass of the @xmath21-meson , @xmath69 ) , coincides here with the effective mass of the produced @xmath96-system , @xmath154 , @xmath80 is the total width of the @xmath21-meson .    taking the expression for @xmath151 , eq.([eq : eq2 ] ) , ( where the @xmath155 coupling constant does not depend , following our assumption , on the virtuality of the @xmath21-meson ) , one can find ,",
