    "the theory of medium - induced gluon radiation has received a lot of attention over the last twenty years , as it became clear that parton energy loss is most likely responsible for the quenching of large @xmath5 hadrons and jets in heavy - ion collisions , first observed at rhic  @xcite and then at the lhc  @xcite .",

    "the soft radiation _",

    "formally the latter inclusive cross section includes the two - parton production cross section entering the numerator , integrated over the radiated gluon phase space .",
    "however , to leading order in @xmath422 , the denominator can be approximated by the production cross section of the leading parton _ without _ soft gluon emission . moreover , assuming that soft rescatterings of the leading parton do not affect @xmath423 , the latter can be calculated as if there were no scattering center in the medium , _",
    "i.e. _ , at zeroth order in the opacity expansion @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "the numerator of is modified by soft rescatterings and must be represented as an expansion in the number @xmath166 of scattering centers encountered by the leading parton .",
    "the @xmath424 term in this expansion coincides with the radiation cross section in the absence of a medium , and thus cancels out in the _ medium - induced _ radiation intensity defined as di^induced di - di^vacuum = _ n=1^ _",

    "( recall that @xmath173 is the screening length of the coulomb scattering potential ( [ coulomb - pot ] ) . ) in the calculation we consider the interaction of each scattering center to the lowest order in @xmath422 .",
    "this implies that each of the @xmath166 scattering centers either contributes a single born interaction in both the amplitude and the conjugate , or it can contribute a double born interaction in the amplitude with no interaction in the conjugate amplitude ( or vice versa ) , thus providing a so - called virtual correction to the aforementioned single - born interaction .",
    "averaging over the position of each scattering center introduces a factor @xmath427 .",
