    "it is well known that the group velocity of a laser can be subluminal or superluminal in atomic gases @xcite and solid praseodymium doped in y~2~sio~5~ @xcite .",
    "the control of the group velocity can be accomplished through the electromagnetically induced transparency and electromagnetically induced amplification @xcite . the spontaneously generated coherence ( sgc )",
    "has a major influence on the regimen of the group velocity .",
    "the effects of the sgc on the change of the group velocity from subluminal to sperluminal was studied for three - level lambda systems without @xcite and with @xcite incoherent pumping .",
    "the three - level v - type system is another model of system of interest in which it can be achieved a probe field group velocity lower or higher than the light speed _ c _",
    "( @xmath0 m / s ) .",
    "there are two kinds of the three - level v - type system which was shown in our work @xcite . in the three - level v - type system of the first kind",
    "one field acts on only one transition .",
    "the relative phase effects on the group velocity in a v - type system of the first kind with spontaneously generated coherence and without incoherent pumping leads to the subluminal and superluminal group velocity @xcite .",
    "the same change from subluminal to superluminal regimen of the group velocity of the probe field can be obtained by variation of the incoherent pumping rate and the sgc parameter , which depends on the angle between the two induced dipole moments , in the v - type system of the first kind with incoherent pumping @xcite . in the three - level v - type system of the second kind all three fields , the probe , the coupling and the incoherent pumping ( if is considered ) fields drive both optical allowed transitions .",
    "the group velocity can pass from the subluminal to superluminal regimen and viceversa by the modification of the relative phase between the probe and coupling fields , too , in the case of this type of system @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper sent to publication @xcite we found that in both kinds of the three - level v - type systems the proper choice of the relative phase between the probe and coupling fields and the incoherent pumping rate leads to the subluminal or superluminal propagation of the probe field .    another parameter which can impinge on the group velocity in both kinds of three - level v - type systems with sgc",
    "is the angle between the two dipole transition moments , denoted with @xmath1 . in the case of the three - level v - type system of the first kind the knob effect of the parameter which is direct proportional with @xmath1",
    "was relieved in connection with the incoherent pumping rate , but without the dependence on the relative phase @xcite .",
    "our goal is to obtain the dependence of the group velocity on the the angle between the two dipole transition moments and the relative phase for the both kinds of the three - level v - type systems described in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we presented a real v - type system of the second kind from the lih molecule in our previous work @xcite . in this case the angle @xmath2 and we showed that it can exhibit subluminal or superluminal group velocity @xcite .",
    "we will compare these results with those obtained from the general formulas in angle @xmath1 for the v - type system of the second kind in the particular case of antiparallel dipole moments when @xmath2 .",
    "a brief presentation of both three - level v - type systems and the formulas of the group index will be given in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the subsection [ subsec2.1 ] is devoted to the three - level v - type system of the first kind and the subsection [ subsec2.2 ] to the three - level v - type system of the second kind .",
    "numerical results of the dependence on the @xmath1 angle of the index group for both kinds of v - type systems are shown in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "we conclude with some remarks in the last section .",
    "we divided the three - level v - type systems with spontaneously generated coherence and incoherent pumping in two kinds @xcite .",
    "below we will describe them and the index group formulas depending on the density matrix elements and the other parameters of the v - type system with incoherent pumping .",
    "the closed three - level v - type system of the first kind is the most known v - type system .",
    "it consists of two closely - lying excited states @xmath3 and @xmath4 and a ground state @xmath5 , as shown in figure [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the rates of spontaneous emission from levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 to ground level @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the transition @xmath11 with frequency @xmath12 are driven by a coupling coherent field ( @xmath13 ) with the rabi frequency @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the transition dipole moment . between the levels @xmath6 and @xmath8 is applied a probe field ( @xmath16 ) with the rabi frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the transition @xmath18 with the frequency @xmath19 and dipole moment @xmath20 is pumped with a rate @xmath21 by an incoherent field .",
    "the detunings of the probe field and the coupling field are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the density matrix formalism was used to describe this system by the statistical view .",
    "the density matrix equations system ( 2 ) from @xcite contains two important parameters related to the sgc : the parameter @xmath24 and the relative phase between the probe and coupling field phases @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 describes the quantum interference between spontaneous emission from excited levels @xmath26 and @xmath27 to ground level @xmath28 and depends on @xmath1 , the angle between the two dipole momentum @xmath20 and @xmath15 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the sgc effects are important only for small energy spacing between the two excited levels @xcite , and for high energy spacing such effects will disappear @xcite .",
    "as the excited levels @xmath26 and @xmath27 are near - degenerated , then @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the condition to have spontaneously generated coherence is @xmath33 , which means that we must have a nonorthogonal dipol momentum of the two transitions .",
    "therefore we choose the dipole momentum so that one field acts on one transition ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) as it can be shown in figure [ fig1](b ) .",
    "rabi frequencies are connected to the angle @xmath1 by the relations @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the influence of the angle @xmath1 on the probe coefficient absorption and refractive index was evidenced in our paper @xcite .",
    "the nonorthogonality of the dipolar momentum can be achieved from the mixing of the levels arising from internal @xcite or external fields @xcite .",
    "the formula of the group index was deduced by us in our previous work @xcite @xmath38 with the derivative of the real part of the density matrix element @xmath39 , @xmath40 , with respect to the probe detuning @xmath41 given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "this relation will be used in our numerical calculations .",
    "the three - level v - type system of the second kind is the system from the figure [ fig1](a ) but where the probe , the coupling and the incoherent pumping fields act on both transitions .",
    "the density matrix equations system differs from the system of linear equations ( 1 ) from @xcite for the v - type system of the first kind by the appearance of the term @xmath42 in the second equation and can be written as @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47\\tilde{\\rho}_{12}-\\eta e^{-i\\phi}(\\tilde{\\rho}_{11}+\\tilde{\\rho}_{22})+\\ ] ] @xmath48 with _ g , g , g , g _ the real rabi frequencies .",
    "the other equations have the same terms as ( 1 ) from @xcite , where the @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are replaced by @xmath21 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the dependence on the angle between the dipole transition moments @xmath20 and @xmath15 , @xmath1 is contained in the same paramater @xmath24 as in the case of the v - type system of the first kind , but additionally it appears in the rabi frequencies formulas as following @xmath54 if we choose the probe field @xmath55 parallel with the dipole transition moment @xmath20 and the coupling field @xmath56 parallel with the dipole transition moment @xmath15 .    using the relations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) from @xcite",
    "the electric susceptibility of the medium @xmath57 becomes @xmath58 the choise of the dipole transition moments from above gives us the formula of the electric susceptibility of the medium as @xmath59 the quantity that we will study is the group index @xmath60 , which is related to the real part of electric susceptibility and is @xmath61 the difference between the above relation and the expression ( 13 ) of the group index from our work @xcite is the presence of the @xmath62 in the second term of the above relation .",
    "the real v - type system of the second kind from lih molecule studied by us in @xcite is a particularly case when the angle between the two dipole transition moments @xmath1 is @xmath63 .",
    "in figure [ fig2 ] can be shown that for the three - level v - type system of the first kind , for each value of the angle @xmath1 between the two dipole transition moments @xmath20 and @xmath15 one can choose the value of the relative phase @xmath25 to have a subluminal ( @xmath64 ) or superluminal ( @xmath65 ) probe field group velocity .",
    "the values of the group index are lower with three order of magnitude for the relative phase @xmath66 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) ) than the relative phase equal with @xmath67 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "we considered the parameters of the system as : @xmath68 hz , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 molecules / m^3^. another behaviour of the group index we can see from the figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) is that it is periodically with the relative phase @xmath25 , with the period @xmath76 .",
    "the figure [ fig3 ] is dedicated to the three - level v - type system of the second kind .",
    "numerical results of the group index @xmath60 from equation ( [ ec5 ] ) are plotted for few values of the relative phase @xmath25 in the range @xmath77 $ ] and the angle @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the system which we choose is the real lih molecule v - type system of the second kind which we have shown in @xcite with the parameters @xmath79 hz , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath75 molecules / m^3^. the rabi frequencies @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given by the relations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , respectively .    for the angle @xmath84 and every relative phase @xmath85 the group index @xmath60 has only positive values which means the probe field group velocity is subluminal as can be seen in figure [ fig3](a ) .",
    "the group index @xmath65 when @xmath86 $ ] and relative phase @xmath85 , then the probe field group velocity is superluminal .",
    "the group index is null when the angle @xmath87 .",
    "this is an expected result , because for @xmath87 there is no effect of the spontaneously generated coherence . in figure [ fig3 ] ( b ) can be seen the behaviour of the group index in the case of the relative phase @xmath88 , which is different and its values are lower with three order of magnitude than in the other case from figure [ fig3 ] ( a ) .",
    "it is kept the periodicity with relative phase @xmath25 with the period @xmath76 .",
    "the straightforward calculations of the group index @xmath60 using the relation ( [ ec5 ] ) and the numerical solutions of the equation system ( [ ec1 ] ) in the case of the real v - type system of the second kind from the lih molecule @xcite lead us to the same graphic as in the figure 7(b ) for the incoherent pumping rate @xmath72 .",
    "we studied the influence of the angle between the two dipole transition moments , denoted @xmath1 , on the group velocity of the probe field for both kinds three - level v - type systems .",
    "we have shown that the group velocity of the probe field in the case of the v - type system of the first kind can be subluminal or superluminal for each value of the angle @xmath1 if we change the value of the relative phase @xmath25 .",
    "the v - type system of the second kind is different .",
    "the group velocity of the probe field is lower than the light velocity for every value of the relative phase @xmath85 and the angle @xmath84 . for an angle",
