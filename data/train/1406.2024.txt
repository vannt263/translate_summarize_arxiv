    "although the above mathematical models adequately describe a lot of natural phenomena , there still exist many complex phenomena in nature which are not described adequately by these models . among them",
    "are crowded systems , such as protein diffusion within cells , @xcite , and diffusion through porous media , @xcite .",

    "anomalous diffusion , on the other hand , possesses pdf s of waiting times and jumps which are inverse power laws , and it can be shown that such a process is described by fractional advection - diffusion equations .",
