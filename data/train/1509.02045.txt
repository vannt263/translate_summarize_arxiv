    "the _ gene expression _ is the process by which genetic information is used to produce functional products of gene expression : proteins and non - coding rnas .",
    "this paper concerns itself with the production of proteins .",
    "the information flow from dna genes to proteins is a fundamental process .",
    "it is composed of three main steps : _ gene activation _ , _ transcription _ and _",
    "translation_.    1 .   the initiation of transcription is strongly regulated .",
    "schematically the gene is said to be in `` inactive state '' if a repressor is bound on the gene s promoter preventing the rna polymerase from binding and is in `` active state '' otherwise .",
    "2 .   when the gene is in active state , the rna polymerase binds and initiates transcription that leads to the creation of a mrna , a copy of a specific dna sequence .",
    "the translation of the messenger into a protein is achieved by a large complex molecule : the _",
    "ribosome_. a ribosome binds to an active mrna , initiates the translation and proceeds to protein elongation .",
    "once the elongation terminates , the protein is released in the medium and the ribosome is anew available for any another translation .",
    "the production of proteins is the most important cellular activity , both for the functional role and the high associated cost in terms of resources . in a _",
    "bacterium for example there are about @xmath0 proteins of approximately @xmath1 different types with a large variability in concentration , depending on their types : from a few dozen up to @xmath2 .",
    "the gene expression is additionally a highly stochastic process and results from the realization of a very large number of elementary stochastic processes of different nature .",
    "the three main steps are the results of a large number of encounters of macromolecules following random motions , due in particular to thermal excitation , in the viscous fluid of the cytoplasm .",
    "one of the key problems is to understand the basic mechanisms which allow a cell to produce a large number of proteins with very different concentrations and in a random context .",
    "this can be seen as a problem of minimization of the variance of the number of proteins of each type .    to study this problem",
    ", one can take a simple stochastic model , with a limited set @xmath3 of parameters preferably , describing the three steps of the production of a given type of protein . once a closed form expression of the variance of the number of proteins is obtained , it is natural to find the parameters of the set @xmath3 which minimizes the variance with the constraint that the mean number of proteins is fixed .",
    "see the survey paulsson  @xcite .",
    "a more effective way to regulate the number of proteins can be of using a direct feedback control , an _ autoregulation _ mechanism , so that the production of proteins is either sped up or slowed down depending on the current number of proteins .",
    "it should be noted that the feedback control loop can involve other intermediate proteins to achieve this goal , like the classical lac operon , but it is not considered here .",
    "see yildirim and mackey  @xcite for example .",
    "the protein can regulate the gene activation simply , for example by being a repressor and tend to bind on his own gene s promoter .",
    "this is the _ autogenous regulation _ scheme .",
    "see goldberger  @xcite and maloy and stewart  @xcite .",
    "see also thattai and van oudenaarden  @xcite .",
    "other autoregulation mechanisms are possible in cells , such as an autoregulation on the mrnas where a protein inhibits its own translation initiation by binding to the translation initiation region of its own mrnas .",
    "it occurs for example in the production of ribosomal proteins , see kaczanowska and rydn - aulin  @xcite .",
    "the idea being that a feedback mechanism may reduce significantly the number of large excursions from the mean . in this paper",
    ", the mathematical analysis will mainly focus on a negative autogenous feedback , when the rate of inactivation of the gene expression grows with the number of proteins .",
    "the classical results concerning the mathematical analysis of the variance of the number of proteins has been investigated in berg  @xcite and rigney  @xcite and reviewed more recently by paulsson  @xcite , see also raj and van oudenaarden  @xcite for the biological aspects .",
    "these references use the three stage model , the state of the system is given by three variables : the state of the promoter , the number of mrnas and the number of proteins .",
    "mathematically , the techniques used rely on the fokker - planck equations of the associated three dimensional markov process and the observation that at equilibrium , a recurrence on the moments of the number of proteins holds .",
    "fromion et al .",
    "@xcite investigates a more general model ( elongation times are not necessarily exponentially distributed in particular ) and an alternative technique to a markovian approach is introduced .",
    "concerning the evaluation of autoregulation , most of mathematical models use a continuous state , the rate of production of proteins depends linearly on the number of mrnas and the rate of production of mrnas is a function @xmath4 exhibiting a non - linear dependence on the current number @xmath5 of proteins . in rosenfeld",
    "@xcite and becskei and serrano  @xcite , based on experiments the constant @xmath4 is taken a _ hill repression function _ , i.e. @xmath6 for some constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the hill coefficient .",
    "see also thattai and van oudenaarden  @xcite .",
    "related models in a similar framework with further results are presented in bokes et al .",
    "@xcite and yvinec et al .",
    "@xcite . for most of these models",
    "the state of the promoter , active or inactive , which is a source of variability is not taken into account , it is in some way encapsulated in the constant @xmath4 whose representation is rarely discussed . in hornos",
    "@xcite the state of the gene expression , on or off , is taken into account but not the number of mrnas and therefore the fluctuations generated by transcription .",
    "the parameter of activation @xmath4 is of course crucial in our case since autogenous regulation rely on the state of the promoter which can be inactivated by proteins .",
    "our model includes it .",
    "see also fournier et al .",
    "@xcite for some simulations of these stochastic models of autoregulation as well as some experiments .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to estimate the possible benefit of the autogenous regulation to control the fluctuations of the number of copies of a given protein .",
    "the efficiency of a production process without feedback control is compared to a production process with an autoregulation of the gene expression , assuming that both of them produce the same average number proteins .",
    "the main characteristic used for the comparison is the standard deviation of the number of proteins at equilibrium . for this purpose ,",
    "two approaches are used .    mathematical analysis .",
    "one first studies the distribution of the number of proteins via a stochastic model .",
    "when there is no regulation , the corresponding classical mathematical model has been investigated in detail for some time now . in particular , the standard deviation of the number of proteins at equilibrium has a closed form expression in terms of the basic parameters of the production process . see for example the survey paulsson  @xcite , and also fromion et al .",
    "@xcite .    to represent the negative feedback of the autogenous regulation , a simple model is used : each protein can be bound , at some rate and for some random duration of time , on its own gene expression .",
    "in this situation the gene expression is inactive and the transcription is not possible during that time .",
    "this amounts to say that the gene expression is deactivated at a rate proportional to the number of proteins .",
    "the activation rate is constant .    as will be seen , the mathematical model of the autogenous regulation is more complicated , in particular there is no recurrence relationship between the moments of the number of proteins at equilibrium as in the classical model of protein production process .",
    "for this reason , a limiting procedure is used , it amounts to assume that the dynamics of the activation of the gene expression and of the evolution of mrnas occur on a much faster time scale than the dynamics of the proteins .",
    "the values of the key parameters are presented in section  [ biopar ] .",
    "the scaling parameter is the multiplicative factor describing the difference of speed of these two time scales .",
    "the main convergence result is theorem  [ theofeed ] .",
    "the assumption of a fast time scale for gene expression activation and mrnas is quite common in the literature , see bokes et al .",
    "@xcite and yvinec et al .",
    "the techniques used in these references rely on singular perturbation methods to deal with the two time scales . in our setting ,",
    "a probabilistic approach is used , as will be seen , it gives precise results on the asymptotic stochastic evolution of the number of proteins .    under this limiting regime",
    "it is shown that , asymptotically , the protein production process can be described as a birth and death process .",
    "see keilson  @xcite for example . in state @xmath10 , the birth rate is given @xmath11 for some constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is a contribution of the paper that , with a simple model of the autoregulation , one can show that the repression mechanism follows indeed a hill repression scheme with an hyperbolic control , i.e. with hill coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "the death rate is not changed by the limiting procedure , it is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , one can get an asymptotic closed form expression of the standard deviation of the number of proteins by using the explicit representation of the equilibrium of this birth and death process .",
    "see corollary  [ corol1 ] .",
    "it is shown that , in this limiting regime , the standard deviation is reduced by 30% .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in section  [ scalingsec ] and section  [ secinv ] and in appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "the mathematical results are obtained via convergence theorems for sequence of markov process , the proof of a stochastic averaging principle and a saddle point approximation result .",
    "we also analyze , via simulations , autogenous regulation but also other aspects related to the regulation of protein production .",
    "this is presented in section  [ secdisc ] .",
    "simulations are used mainly because of the complexity of the mathematical models of some aspects of the autogenous regulation . by using plausible biological parameters ,",
    "one gets an improvement of 15% for the standard deviation of the number of proteins can be expected .",
    "this is significantly less than the performances of the limiting mathematical model studied in section  [ scalingsec ] .",
    "the main reason seems to be that that the scaling parameter is not , in some cases , sufficiently large to have a reasonable accuracy with the limit given by the convergence result of theorem  [ theofeed ] .    via simulations ,",
    "one also investigates the case when the regulation is not on the gene expression but on the corresponding mrnas : a protein can block an mrna for some time . in this situation",
    ", it could be expected that the production process is modulated more smoothly by playing on the inactivation of a fraction of the mrnas and not on the rough on - off control of the gene expression .",
    "it is shown that the improvement is real but not that big ( less than 10% ) .",
    "it is nevertheless remarkable that if the average life time of mrnas is significantly increased , our experiments show that the benefit of such regulation can be of the order of more than 30% on the standard deviation of the number of proteins .",
    "coming back to regulation on the gene expression .",
    "our experiments show that , despite the impact of autogenous regulation on fluctuations of the number of proteins can be limited , it has nevertheless a very interesting property . starting with a number of proteins significantly less ( or greater ) than the average number of proteins at equilibrium , the autogenous regulation returns to the `` correct '' number of proteins much faster than the classical production process without regulation .",
    "this is a clear advantage of this mechanisms to adapt quickly when biological conditions change due to an external stress for example .",
    "see section  [ vers ] .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed , via experiments , in rosenfeld et al .",
    "see also camas et al .",

    "like in most of the literature , it is assumed that the various events , like the encounter of two macromolecules , occurring within the cell have a duration with an exponential distribution .",

    "this scheme can consequently increase the variability of the production process of proteins .",
    "a possible idea to reduce the variance due to the activation / inactivation of the gene is to transfer the activation / inactivation process at the level the mrnas .",

    "the affinity of the transcription factor for the promoter of the gene can be adapted for that purpose .",
    "conversely , when the external stress disappears , the production of the protein has to be quickly reduced to minimize the consumption of resources .",

    "two cases are investigated : when the initial number of proteins is below the value equilibrium , see figure  [ figversa ] , or above this value , see figure  [ figversb ] .",
    "as it can be seen , the autogenous production process converges more rapidly to equilibrium in both cases .",
    "our simulations show that when the initial value is 290 , the autogenous production process is 40% faster than the process without feedback to reach the level 1300 ( the equilibrium is at 1400 in this case ) .",
    "a similar result holds in the other case .",
    "these interesting properties are related to the modulation of the gene activity . in the experiment of figure  [ figversa ] , for the autogenous process",
    "the rate of activity of the gene is of the order of 50% at the beginning and it is only of the order of 0.1 later at equilibrium . without regulation",
    "this rate is constant throughout the simulation .",

    "an analogous explanation holds for the experiment of figure  [ figversa ] , in the autogenous process .",
