    "@xcite that the quark - quark interaction in the color antitriplet channel is attractive and drives a cooper pairing instability in quark matter in the limit of high density in which the fermi energy of the quarks dominates over the one - gluon exchange interaction energy .",
    "because of the relativistic nature of high density quark matter , the color magnetic ( transverse ) force plays a dominant role in cooper pairing .",
    "this interaction is nonlocal in time just like the electron - phonon interaction in ordinary superconductors @xcite , but in contrast is long - ranged in the absence of static screening .",
    "this long - range nature gives rise to a different dependence of the pairing gap on the qcd coupling constant @xmath1 from the bcs result @xcite .",
    "at zero temperature , up to leading order in @xmath1 , the logarithm of the gap arises from the dynamically screened magnetic force that involves landau damped virtual gluons in a normal medium .",
    "corrections to the gluon self - energy ( polarization function ) by the gap do not affect the logarithm of the gap up to subleading order in @xmath1 at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this is because the gluon self - energy is modified by the gap significantly only at gluon energies of @xmath2 .",
    "the influence of such corrections on the gap equation near the transition temperature @xmath0 , however , has yet to be examined .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the structure of the gap equation near @xmath0 by including the polarization effects of the color superconducting medium on exchanged gluons .",
    "we then estimate corrections thereby induced to the parameters characterizing the fourth order terms in the ginzburg - landau free energy of a weakly coupled uniform superfluid of massless three - flavor quarks .",
    "these corrections , divided by the weak coupling value , are of order @xmath1 , in contrast with the case of a short - range pairing interaction in which the corrections generally contain a factor proportional to the ratio of the transition temperature to the fermi energy .",
    "we find that the polarization corrections keep the color - flavor locked phase the most stable just below @xmath0 . throughout this paper , we consider a system of three - flavor ( @xmath3 ) and three - color ( @xmath4 ) massless quarks at temperature @xmath5 and baryon chemical potential @xmath6 , and use units @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the fermi momentum is common to all colors and flavors .",
    "in this section we address the question of how the gap equation relevant in the weak coupling regime , in which the pairing interaction is induced by one - gluon exchange , is modified by the polarization effects of the color superconducting medium . for this purpose we first consider a @xmath8 pairing state that is @xmath9-isoscalar and @xmath10-color antitriplet , since this is one of the simplest states that belong to a color and flavor antisymmetric channel with @xmath8 .",
