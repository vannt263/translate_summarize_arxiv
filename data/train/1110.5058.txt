    "<S> testing hypotheses about a physical system by observation is a fundamental endeavor in scientific research . </S>",
    "<S> observations are often indirect , noisy , and limited ; to choose the best model of a system among potential candidates , statistical inference is the most logical way @xcite and has been extensively employed in diverse fields of science and engineering .    </S>",
    "<S> many important quantum mechanics experiments , such as tests of quantum mechanics @xcite , quantum detection of weak forces or magnetic fields @xcite , and quantum target detection @xcite , are examples of hypothesis testing . to test quantum nonlocality , for instance , </S>",
    "<S> one should compare the quantum model with the best classical model ; bell s inequality and its variations , which impose general bounds on observations of local - hidden - variable systems , have been widely used in this regard @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analyses of experimental data in many such tests have nonetheless been criticized by peres @xcite : the statistical averages in all these inequalities can never be measured exactly in a finite number of trials . </S>",
    "<S> one should use statistical inference to account for the uncertainties and provide an operational meaning to the data .    </S>",
    "<S> another important recent development in quantum physics is the experimental demonstration of quantum behavior in increasingly macroscopic systems , such as mechanical oscillators @xcite and microwave resonators @xcite . to test the quantization of the oscillator energy @xcite , for example </S>",
    "<S> , the use of quantum filtering theory has been proposed to process the data @xcite , but testing quantum behavior by assuming quantum mechanics can be criticized as begging the question . </S>",
    "<S> an ingenious proposal by clerk _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> considers the third moment of energy as a test of energy quantization @xcite . like the correlations in bell s inequality , </S>",
    "<S> however , the third moment is a statistical average and can not be measured exactly in finite time . </S>",
    "<S> again , statistical inference should be used to test the quantum behavior of a system rigorously , especially when the measurements are weak and noisy . </S>",
    "<S> the good news here is that the error probabilities for hypothesis testing should decrease exponentially with the number of measurements when the number is large @xcite , so one can always compensate for a weak signal - to - noise ratio by increasing the number of trials .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum hypothesis testing was first studied by holevo @xcite and yuen _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> i propose a more general quantum theory of hypothesis testing for _ model _ discrimination , allowing the hypotheses to be not just about the initial state but also about the dynamics of the system under a series of observations . </S>",

    "<S> is significantly simplified to produce compact formulae for the likelihood ratio , the central quantity in statistical hypothesis testing . </S>",
    "<S> the formulae enable one to compute the ratio efficiently in many cases of interest and should be useful for numerical approximations in general . </S>",
    "<S> notable prior work on continuous quantum hypothesis testing is reported in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which study state discrimination or parameter estimation only and have not derived the general likelihood - ratio formulae proposed here .    </S>",
    "<S> to illustrate the theory , i discuss two potential applications , namely quantum detection of a classical stochastic waveform and test of harmonic - oscillator energy quantization . </S>",
    "<S> waveform detection is a basic operation in future quantum sensing applications , such as gravitational - wave detection , optomechanical force detection , and atomic magnetometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tests of energy quantization , on the other hand , have become increasingly popular in experimental physics due to the rapid recent progress in device fabrication technologies @xcite . besides these two applications , the theory is expected to find wide use in quantum information processing and quantum physics in general , whenever new claims about a quantum system need to be tested rigorously .    </S>",

    "<S> the error probabilities are then @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> for example , the neyman - pearson criterion minimizes @xmath11 under a constraint on @xmath12 , while the bayes criterion minimizes @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being arbitrary positive numbers . for multiple independent trials , </S>",
    "<S> the final likelihood ratio is simply the product of the ratios .    in most cases , </S>",
    "<S> the error probabilities are difficult to calculate analytically and only bounds , such as the chernoff upper bound @xcite , may be available , but the likelihood ratio can be used to update the posterior hypothesis probabilities from prior probabilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 via @xmath18 and @xmath19 and therefore quantifies the strength of evidence for @xmath1 against @xmath0 given @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
