    "we calculate the electron - positron pair flux of the electrosphere and compare our results with those obtained by @xcite .",

    "strange quark matter in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase of qcd , which occurs for @xmath58 mev , could be rigorously electrically neutral , despite the unequal quark masses , even in the presence of the electron chemical potential @xcite .",
    "hence , for the cfl state of quark matter @xmath59 and no electrons are present inside or outside the quark star @xcite",
    ".    however , @xcite pointed out that for sufficiently large @xmath60 the low density regime is rather expected to be in the  2-color - flavor superconductor  phase in which only @xmath20 and @xmath21 quarks of two color are paired in single condensate while the ones of the third color , and @xmath22 quarks of all three colors , are unpaired . in this phase , some electrons are still present .",
    "in other words , electrons may be absent in the core of strange stars but present , at least , near the surface where the density is lowest .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of the cfl effect can reduce the electron density at the surface and hence it can also significantly reduce the intensity of the electric field and the electromagnetic emissivity of the electrons in the electrosphere . therefore , in order to describe the radiation properties of the electrosphere we assume that @xmath61 .",

    "9 . there is a significant effect in the electron - positron flux due to the suppression of pair creation by the quark star s surface .",
    "the possibility of the thermal contribution to the pair creation process was discussed by @xcite . in the first loop approximation",
    "there is no thermal contribution to the imaginary part of the effective lagrangian and therefore to the particle production rate .",
    "this means that the pair production rate in strong electric fields is basically independent of temperature , and the temperature dependence of this effect in the electrosphere of the quark stars is indirect and is due to the temperature dependence of the electron number density and of the corresponding electric field .",
    "finally , we compare the generalized schwinger pair production rates and the corresponding flux with the expressions proposed by @xcite , and given by eq .",

    "however , this comparison is not correct in the concrete physical framework of the quark star surface , since in the @xcite model the electron thermalization time is used to calculate the flux , while the schwinger flux is estimated in terms of the pair creation time in vacuum , which is of the order of @xmath228 @xcite . in order to compare our results with the previous estimations of the electron - positron pair rate at the surface of strange stars , we have to systematically take into account the number of available ( free ) electron states at the surface of the star and the thermalization effects in both models .    to compare the two mechanisms we start with the discussion of the created particle number densities in the two models . in the schwinger mechanism in vacuum ,",
    "the particle number density is @xmath229 , which , in the approximation of the constant electric field , can be written as @xmath230    for a fixed value of the electric potential in the electrosphere @xmath231 , which for simplicity we take as the electric potential at the surface of the quark star , the electric field is given by @xmath232 , and the electron number density is @xmath233 .",

    "the presence of a surface magnetic field @xmath266 can also enhance the pair production rate @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field increases the pair production rate by a factor @xmath267 .",
    "if @xmath268 , there will be a significant increase in the pair production rate .",
    "the electric field of the electrosphere could be as high as @xmath269 mev@xmath270 .",

    "magnetic fields with such high values may be present in very young quark stars . assuming equipartition of energy , the energy of the differential rotation can be converted into magnetic energy , so that @xmath274 , where @xmath275 is the moment of inertia of the star , @xmath252 its radius and @xmath276 and @xmath277 are the angular velocity and the variation of the angular velocity , respectively . therefore the magnetic field of a young quark star can be approximated as @xmath278 mev@xmath279 . by assuming that @xmath280",
    ", we can obtain values of the magnetic field as high as @xmath281 mev@xmath279 .",
    "of course magnetic fields of such strength are not stable , because they will be pushed to and through the surface by buoyant forces and then reconnect @xcite . for a magnetic field of the order of @xmath281 mev@xmath279 we have @xmath282 .",
    "therefore strong magnetic fields can significantly increase the electron - positron pair production rate , and , consequently the luminosity of the electrosphere of quark stars .",
    "in the present paper we have re - considered the electron - positron pair emission from the electrosphere of quark stars , as originally proposed by @xcite , by pointing out the important role the boundary effects and the inhomogeneity in the distribution of the electric field may play in the pair creation process . at zero temperature ,",
    "there are no available free energy states in the electron plasma at the strange star s surface .",
    "therefore , at low temperatures @xmath283 mev ( corresponding to a quark star surface electric potential of @xmath248 mev ) , the pair production mechanism by the strong electric field of the electrosphere is severely limited by the quantum effects and the exclusion principle specific to the fermi - dirac statistics . at high temperatures @xmath284 mev ,",
    "the pair creation rate is controlled by the electric field @xmath88 and not by the temperature , because such a process is essentially a quantum process . once the number of available electron states becomes higher than the schwinger pair production rate ,",
    "electron - positron pairs can be freely created by the electric field at the surface of strange stars .",
    "this happens at a critical temperature @xmath1 , which strongly depends on the electrostatic properties of the quark star surface .",
    "the critical temperature increases with the increase of the electrostatic potential @xmath51 . at high enough temperatures ,",
    "the pair creation process is almost independent of the temperature and is controlled exclusively by the electric field . on the other hand , the actual thermalized pair creation rate , which , from an astrophysical and observational point of view is the most relevant quantity , depends on the temperature through the thermalized time scale.the number density of pairs can be accurately evaluated by using the schwinger formalism and by taking into account the inhomogeneities in the electric field distribution .",
    "however , the boundary effects also induce large quantitative and qualitative deviations of the particle production rate from what one deduces with the schwinger formula and its generalization for the inhomogeneous electric field of the electrosphere .    due to all these effects",
    ", we estimate that at high temperatures the energy flux due to @xmath285 pairs production could be lower than in the initial proposal of @xcite",
    ". however , this flux could still be the main observational signature of a quark star .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of a strong magnetic field at the quark star surface may significantly enhance the electron - positron flux .",
