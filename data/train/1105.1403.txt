    "the two classical examples of active scalar equations arising fluid dynamics are burgers equation from compressible fluids , and the two - dimensional vorticity equation from incompressible fluids .",
    "the analytical study of these seemingly simple equations has generated a substantial amount of new mathematics over the past centuries .",
    "an active scalar equation from geophysical fluids that has recently received considerable attention in the mathematical literature ( see for instance the reference list in @xcite ) is the surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) equation",
    ". introduced by constantin , majda , and tabak  @xcite as a two - dimensional toy model for the three - dimensional fluid equations , the sqg equation has been studied in both the inviscid and the viscous versions , and recently it was shown that the critically viscous equation is globally well - posed @xcite . however",
    "the possibility of finite time blow - up in the inviscid sqg equation is still open .    in the present paper",
    "we address a class of three - dimensional active scalar equations for which the drift velocity is more singular by one derivative than the active scalar .",
    "in contrast , the drift velocity for the sqg equation is of the same order of derivatives as the active scalar .",
    "our motivation for addressing such singular drift equations comes from a model presented by moffatt  @xcite for the geodynamo and magneto - geostrophic turbulence in the earth s fluid core .",
    "the nonlinear effects in this three - dimensional system are incorporated in an evolution equation with singular drift for a scalar buoyancy field .",
    "this magneto - geostrophic ( mg ) equation has certain features in common with the sqg equation , most notably that @xmath0 is the critical lebesgue space with respect to the natural scaling for both critically diffusive equations .",
    "inspired by the proof of global well - posedness for the critically diffusive sqg equation given by caffarelli and vasseur  @xcite , we recently used de giorgi techniques to prove global well - posedness for the critically diffusive mg equation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this present paper we show that the non - diffusive mg and sqg equations are distinctly different at the analytical level , not only because of the more singular drift velocity , but also because of the structure of the operators relating the velocity to the active scalar .",
    "we study a class of nonlinear active scalar equations for the unknown scalar field @xmath1 , driven by a singular velocity vector field @xmath2 , namely @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a physical parameter , and @xmath5 is a @xmath6-smooth source term .",
    "the velocity @xmath7 is divergence - free , and is obtained from @xmath8 via @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a @xmath12 matrix of caldern - zygmund operators of convolution type , such that @xmath13 for any smooth @xmath14 .",
    "here and throughout this paper we use the summation convention on repeated indices . for simplicity , we consider the domain to be @xmath15^{d}\\times(0,\\infty)$ ] . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , since the mean of @xmath8 is conserved by the flow .",
    "the model proposed by moffatt is derived from the full mhd equations for an incompressible , rotating , density stratified , electrically conducting fluid . after a series of approximations relevant to the earth s fluid core",
    ", a linear relationship is established between the velocity and magnetic vectors , and the scalar buoyancy @xmath8 . the active scalar equation for @xmath1 that contains",
    "the nonlinear process in moffatt s model is precisely , but where the divergence - free velocity @xmath7 is explicitly obtained from the buoyancy as @xmath18 for @xmath19 . here",
    "the @xmath20 are fourier multiplier operators with symbols given explicitly by @xmath21where the fourier variable @xmath22 is such that @xmath23 .",
    "on @xmath24 we let @xmath25 , since for self - consistency of the model we assume that @xmath8 and @xmath7 have zero _ vertical mean_. it can be directly checked that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , and hence the velocity field @xmath7 given by is indeed divergence - free .",
    "it is important to note that although the symbols @xmath28 are bounded in the region of fourier space where @xmath29 , this is not the case on the `` curved '' frequency regions where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . in such regions the symbols are unbounded , since as @xmath33 we have @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a fixed constant , and that this bound is sharp . in  @xcite we make precise the fact that ",
    ", with velocity given by  , is an example of the abstract system  , by letting @xmath36 be the zero - order fourier multipliers @xmath37 we refer to the evolution equation ",
    ", with drift velocity @xmath7 given by ",
    ", as the _ magneto - geostrophic _ equation ( mg ) .",
    "on the other hand , we refer to the general case when @xmath7 is given by as the _ abstract magneto - geostrophic _ equation ( amg ) .",
    "we make this distinction to emphasize that some of the theorems stated in this paper do not make use of the explicit structure of the symbol of @xmath38 , whereas other results , including ill - posedness , make explicit use of the specific structure given by . in addition , we shall refer to the _ diffusive _ evolution , i.e. @xmath39 , as @xmath40 ( respectively @xmath41 ) , and to the _ non - diffusive _ case @xmath42 as @xmath43 ( respectively @xmath44 ) .",
    "the physical parameters of the geodynamo model are the following : @xmath45 is the rotation rate of the earth , @xmath46 is the magnetic diffusivity of the fluid core , and @xmath47 is the strength of the steady , uniform mean part of the magnetic field in the fluid core .",
    "the perturbation magnetic field vector @xmath48 is computed from @xmath1 via the operator @xmath49 in the earth s fluid core the value of the diffusivity @xmath50 is very small .",
    "hence it is relevant to address both the diffusive evolution  , and the non - diffusive version where @xmath51 .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the diffusive and the non - diffusive systems have contrasting properties : if @xmath39 the equation is globally well - posed and the solutions are @xmath52 smooth for positive time  @xcite , whereas for @xmath51 we shall prove that the equation is ill - posed in the sense of hadamard in sobolev spaces , but locally well - posed is spaces of analytic functions .",
    "we first address the non - diffusive version of .",
    "we prove that the @xmath44 equations are locally well - posed in the space of real - analytic functions .",
    "the proof of analytic well - posedness , a cauchy - kowalewskaya - type result , is given in terms of the gevrey - class norms introduced by foias and temam  @xcite for the navier - stokes equations , combined with ideas from @xcite for the euler equations .",
    "moreover , we show that the breakdown of the real - analytic solutions is fully characterized by a sobolev norm of the solution , and the initial data , providing an effective self - consistency tool for numerical simulations of the @xmath44 equations . in addition",
    ", we point out that if the matrix @xmath36 is self - adjoint , the operator @xmath53 is anti - symmetric , and the arguments of @xcite may be used to obtain the local well - posedness of the @xmath44 equations in sobolev spaces .",
    "we emphasize that the specific @xmath43 operator @xmath54 defined via  is _ not _ anti - symmetric .    in the theory of differential equations , it is classical to call a cauchy problem _ well - posed _ , in the sense of hadamard , if given any initial data in a functional space @xmath55 , the problem has a unique solution in @xmath56 , with @xmath57 depending only on the @xmath55-norm of the initial data , and moreover the solution map @xmath58 satisfies strong continuity properties , e.g. it is uniformly continuous , lipschitz , or even @xmath52 smooth , for a sufficiently nice space @xmath59 . if one of these properties fail , the cauchy problem is called _ ill - posed_. depending on the specific equation , and on the regularity of the space @xmath55 considered , one or more properties of a well - posed problem may fail , either locally or globally in time . at one end of this spectrum",
    "we have the dramatic examples of _ blow - up _ in finite time for solutions ( e.g. @xcite for the prandtl equations ) , while at the other end we have the case in which the solution map is continuous with respect to perturbations in the initial data , but _ not @xmath60-smooth _ for some @xmath61 , or at least not @xmath52-smooth ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in - between cases of ill - posedness",
    "may be due to the fact that @xmath55 is too large , such as _ non - uniqueness _ of solutions ( e.g. for @xmath62 weak solutions of the @xmath43 equation  @xcite ) , or _ norm explosion _ , i.e. arbitrary small data leads to an arbitrarily large solution in arbitrary small time , preventing the solution map to be continuous ( cf .",
    "@xcite for the fluid equations , or @xcite for dispersive equations ) .",
    "see tao s book  @xcite for a more detailed discussion .    in this paper",
    "we prove that the solution map associated to the cauchy problem for the @xmath43 equation is not lipschitz continuous with respect to perturbations in the initial data around a specific steady profile @xmath63 , in the topology of a certain sobolev space @xmath55 .",
    "hence the cauchy problem is ill - posed in the sense of hadamard . in order to prove this we first consider the instability of the @xmath43 equation , when linearized about a particular steady state .",
    "we employ techniques from continued fractions in order to construct an unstable eigenvalue for the linearized operator .",
    "the use of continued fractions in a fluid stability problem was introduced by meshalkin and sinai  @xcite for the navier - stokes equations and later adapted for the euler equations by friedlander , strauss , and vishik  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the navier - stokes and euler equations , where the linear operator generates a bounded semigroup , for the non - diffusive equation we construct eigenvalues which have arbitrarily large real part .",
    "this shows , in particular , that the linearized @xmath43 operator does not generate a semigroup over sobolev spaces .",
    "ill - posedness in sobolev spaces for the full nonlinear problem , then follows from perturbation arguments , which consist of showing that we can not have a solution map that is lipschitz with respect to the initial data .",
    "we emphasize that the mechanism giving the ill - posedness of the nonlinear @xmath43 equations is not merely the order @xmath64 derivative loss in the map @xmath53 .",
    "rather it is a combination of this derivative loss , with the anisotropy of the fourier symbol of @xmath38 in  , _ and _ the fact that the symbol of @xmath38 is _",
    "even_. we note that the even nature of the symbol of @xmath38 plays a central role in the proof of non - uniqueness for @xmath62-weak solutions to @xmath43 given by shvydkoy in  @xcite , via methods from convex integration . in contrast , an example of an active scalar equation where the map @xmath53 is unbounded , but given by an _ odd fourier multiplier _",
    ", is the limiting case of the inviscid modified sqg equation , introduced by ohkitani  @xcite .",
    "this equation was recently shown in  @xcite to give a locally well - posed problem in sobolev spaces ( see also remark  [ rem : existence : sobolev ] below ) .",
    "lastly , we study the critically diffusive system . we consider the evolution equation linearized about an arbitrary smooth steady state @xmath63 , and prove that if the associated linearized operator has an unstable eigenvalue , then the full nonlinear @xmath41 system is lyapunov unstable with respect to perturbations in the @xmath65 norm .",
    "the proof uses a bootstrap argument , a variant of which has been recently employed in a number of fluid contexts ( see for example  @xcite ) . here",
    "the main difficulty arises due to the singular nature of @xmath7 given by , which makes it challenging to control the growth of the nonlinearity . to overcome this obstacle we give a new _ a priori _ bound on a sub - critical sobolev norm of @xmath8 , which is uniform in time .",
    "this bound does not follow directly from our earlier work  @xcite , and we give the necessary details in the appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "we then turn to address the linear instability issue for @xmath40 . using a continued fraction construction , analogous to the treatment given in section  [ sec : ill - posedness ] for the case @xmath66",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of unstable , but _ bounded _ eigenvalues . combining this example with the result that linear implies nonlinear instability proven earlier for @xmath41 , we conclude that there exists a steady state around which the moffatt model is nonlinearly unstable .",
    "such an example produces strong growth in the magnetic field @xmath48 , proportional to @xmath67 , which is consistent with the dynamo scenario .",
    "in this section we consider the non - diffusive problem .",
    "first we address the @xmath44 equation , which we recall below @xmath68      for a large class of equations which arise as singular limits in fluid mechanics ( e.g. the prandtl boundary layer equations , the hydrostatic euler equations ) , the strength and structure of the nonlinearity prevents a local existence theory in spaces with finite order of smoothness , such as sobolev spaces .",
    "however , if the derivative loss in the nonlinearity @xmath69 is of order at most one , both in @xmath7 and in @xmath70 , it is possible to obtain the local existence and uniqueness of solutions in spaces of real - analytic functions , in the spirit of a cauchy - kowalewskaya result ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in this section",
    "we prove that the @xmath44 equation falls in the category of singular equations for which we have analytic well - posedness , and we give a condition that prevents the breakdown of real - analyticity of the solution .",
    "our first result in this direction is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : analytic ] let @xmath71 be real - analytic , with radius of analyticity at least @xmath72 , and analytic norm @xmath73 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath74 and a unique real - analytic solution on @xmath75 to the initial value problem associated to .",
    "classically , a real - analytic function @xmath76 is characterized by a bound of the type @xmath77 , for all @xmath78 and all multi - indices @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are constants .",
    "the supremum over all values of @xmath81 for which such a bound is available is the analyticity radius of @xmath82 . in the periodic setting of this paper",
    "there exists an alternate characterization of real - analytic functions : @xmath82 is real - analytic with radius proportional to @xmath83 if and only if the fourier coefficients @xmath84 decay like @xmath85 as @xmath86 .    as in @xcite",
    ", we use the gevrey - class real - analytic norm @xmath87 where @xmath83 denotes the analyticity radius , @xmath88 is the sobolev exponent , and since we work in the mean - free setting we let @xmath89 .",
    "we have the a priori estimate @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the standard @xmath92 inner product . using plancherel s theorem ,",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath93 may be written as @xmath94 since the the matrix @xmath36 consists of fourier multipliers with bounded symbols , we obtain from that @xmath95 for all @xmath96 , and hence @xmath97 for some positive constant @xmath98 . in the above estimate",
    "we have used the triangle inequality @xmath99 , and @xmath100 since @xmath101 . since the right side of estimate is symmetric with respect to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we need to only give the bound for the case @xmath104 . summing first in @xmath105 , and using the cauchy - schwartz inequality we obtain from that @xmath106 since @xmath107 , for some positive constant @xmath108 depending only on @xmath109 and universal constants . from and we obtain the a priori bound @xmath110 having arrived at , the argument is the same as in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we may let @xmath111 be decreasing and satisfy the ordinary differential equation @xmath112 with initial condition @xmath113 , so that the right side of is negative , and therefore @xmath114 as long as @xmath115 .",
    "these arguments prove the existence of a real - analytic solution @xmath116 on @xmath117 , where the maximal time of existence of the real - analytic solution is the time it takes the analyticity radius @xmath111 to reach @xmath118 , i.e. @xmath119 .",
    "this proof may be made formal using a standard picard iteration argument .",
    "we omit further details .",
    "whereas theorem  [ thm : analytic ] guarantees the local in time existence and uniqueness of a real - analytic solution to  , it gives almost no intuition on what happens to the real - analytic solution at the time when the analyticity radius becomes @xmath118 . in theorem",
    "[ thm : bkm ] below we prove that if at time @xmath57 a certain _ sobolev _ norm of the solution is suitably controlled in terms of the initial data , then the real - analytic solution may be continued past @xmath57 ; therefore the breakdown of real - analyticity is controlled only by the initial data and only a sobolev norm of the solution .",

    "in particular , for most numeric simulations the initial data is _ entire _ ( a finite trigonometric polynomial ) , and hence @xmath72 may be taken arbitrarily large . in this case condition",
    "shows that if @xmath130 increases at a fast rate near @xmath57 , the exponential factor on the right side of becomes negligible compared to @xmath131 , and so the breakdown of analyticity is due to the accumulation near @xmath57 of the sobolev norm .    with the notation of the proof of theorem  [ thm : analytic ] , we recall the estimate , i.e. @xmath132 the proofs differ in the way we estimate nonlinear term @xmath93 . from , which is symmetric with respect to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and using the bound @xmath133 which holds for all @xmath134 , @xmath93 may be bounded as @xmath135 if @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a large enough constant depending only on @xmath109 .",
