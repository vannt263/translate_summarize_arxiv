    "mergers between galaxies play a key role for a galaxy evolution since interacting galaxies have bridge or tailed structure which is not seen in isolated galaxies .",
    "in addition to the morphological evolution , an interaction between gas - rich progenitor galaxies condenses gas and triggers star - burst activities in the nuclear regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and throughout the extended disks @xcite . in some instance",
    ", an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is triggered by efficient feeding of the gas to the nuclear regions through a merger event ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    since molecular gas is the important ingredient for current and future star formations , observations of dense molecular gas",
    "are crucial for understanding the processes and timescales controlling star formation .",
    "the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities and the luminosities of dense gas tracers such as co  ( 32 ) and hcn  ( 10 ) , whose critical densities are @xmath8 @xmath9 have observationally linear relation @xcite in local galaxies , and theoretical models basically suggest that linear relation is seen because dense gas is likely to be direct fuel for massive star formation @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the co  ( 32 ) emission line can be used to trace the moderately dense gas that is associated with star formation . @xcite",
    "have shown that the integrated co  ( 32 ) line luminosity ( @xmath0 ) is correlated with the star formation rate ( sfr ) traced in fir luminosities ( @xmath1 ) , using submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of 14 local ultra / luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirgs ) supplemented with the co  ( 32 ) data obtained toward high - z sources ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation was further investigated by @xcite using more quiescent  disk \" galaxies in the local universe , finding that the star formation efficiency ( sfe=@xmath7 ) of the quiescent galaxies is on average lower than those of the merging u / lirgs .",
    "moreover , @xcite suggest that the co  ( 32 ) to fir luminosity relation is universally applicable to different types of galaxies observed at different scales , from spatially resolved nearby galaxy disks to distant infrared ( ir ) luminous galaxies , within @xmath10 dex scatter . by comparing observations of low to high-_j _ co transitions ,",
    "@xcite find that the slope in the @xmath11@xmath12 plane is near unity for lower-_j _ co , but decreases gradually for higher-_j _ transitions ( from 0.93 for _ j _ = 65 to 0.47 for _ j _ = 1312 ) . on the other hand , recent similar studies with larger sample sources @xcite",
    "suggest that the slopes are close to unity for high-_j _ co lines ( _ j _",
    "@xmath13 43 ) .    from observations of co emission in normal and star - burst galaxies at high - redshifts",
    ", it is found that isolated normal disk galaxies and star - burst systems follow a bimodal sequence , both in the molecular gas mass  ir luminosity ( @xmath14_m_@xmath15@xmath16 ) plane , ( or equivalently the molecular gas mass surface density  sfr surface density plane ; the kenicutt - schmidt relation , @xcite ) and the @xmath11@xmath16 plane , albeit the bimodality is less apparent in the latter @xcite .",
    "star formation in the disk galaxies is often regarded as the long - lasting mode , whereas galaxies in the star - burst sequence are experiencing a more rapid mode of star formation ( higher sfe ) , possibly due to galaxies involved in a major merger .",
    "in contrast , numerical simulations of merging galaxies provided by @xcite have shown that isolated and merging galaxies do not produce the bimodal relationship , and mergers are rather close to the sequence of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the exact location and evolution of merging galaxies in the @xmath11@xmath12 plane through a systematic observation toward early ( before coalescence ) and late stage ( after coalescence ) mergers with a large fir range .",
    "however , most of the observational studies had focused on late stage mergers that are bright in the fir luminosity ( u / lirgs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we conducted a co  ( 32 ) single dish survey using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste : @xcite ) along the complete merger sequence with a wide fir range ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the details of aste observation and data analysis in section 2 .",
    "the relation between @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and sfe in a variety of sources is investigated in section 3 , and we conclude this paper in section 4 .",
    "we adopted @xmath18 = 73 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20 = 0.27 , and @xmath21 = 0.73 for all of the analysis throughout this paper .",
    "we selected  early stage merger \" ( double nuclei in optical image ) from the vv - catalog @xcite , along the following criteria ; ( a ) both galaxies have measured _ b_-band magnitudes , and the difference of the _ b_-band magnitude between the two galaxies in a system is @xmath22 3 mag ( in order to select major mergers ) , ( b ) the system is identified in the _ iras _ revised bright galaxy sample ( @xmath23 rbgs , @xcite ) , ( c ) the optical radial velocity is known for both sources , and ( d ) the declination is @xmath22 30 degrees . for the current observations , we selected nine pairs ( vv  81 , vv  217 , vv  242 , vv  272 , vv  352 , vv  729 , vv  122 , vv  830 , and vv  731 ) out of the 40 galaxies which satisfy the criteria . additionally , we observed iras f16399 - 0937 as an early stage merging galaxy while the aste 22@xmath24  beam covers both nuclei separated by 3.4 kpc .",

    "the total observation time was @xmath28120 hours ( including overhead ) to observe all 26 individual galaxies .",
    "we conducted single point observations with the position switch mode .",
    "the main beam size is 22  at 345 ghz , and we specify the off position to be 5  away from the target sources .",
    "we used two types of receivers ; cats345 @xcite in 2014b and dash345 in 2015a , 2015b , and 2015c .",
    "we used the 2048 mhz mode of whsf @xcite for the backend spectrometer ( velocity resolution and coverage are 0.86 and 1750 km s@xmath19 at 350 ghz , respectively ) .",
    "r - sky calibration was carried out every 15 minutes , and the system noise temperature was typically 200400 k. absolute flux scales of the obtained spectra were calibrated by observing a standard source at least once a night .",

    "the aste @xmath30 beam corresponds to @xmath31 kpc for the nearest target arp 230 ( @xmath32 mpc ) .",
    "since the typical co  ( 32 ) size of lirgs is @xmath33 kpc @xcite , we assume that our aste @xmath30 beam is large enough ( at least comparable ) to trace bulk of co  ( 32 ) emission .",
    "we use the @xmath34 which is the software package developed at the nobeyama radio observatory to process the raw data .",
    "low quality spectra with a winding baseline are flagged by eye and only the high quality spectra are integrated .",
    "the flag rate ( @xmath28 30  70 @xmath35 ) strongly depends on the weather conditions .",
    "the spectra are then smoothed to a velocity resolution of 30 km s@xmath19 ( for sources with co  ( 32 ) detection ) or 50 km s@xmath19 ( for non - detection ) with a boxcar function in order to improve the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "baselines are fitted with a polynomial function of degree one , but we used second and third orders in some cases with large baseline fluctuations .",

    "since most of the data were taken with a smaller beam with respect to the size of the galaxy , or the derivation of the fir luminosity is different from ours , we will not use these data in our comparative analysis .",

    "we assume that all of the fir emission arises from a galaxy with the radio detection .",

    "we assumed that the co  ( 32 ) emission line measures the total fuel for molecular gas which is the direct material of star formation in a galaxy , and @xmath1 arises mostly from dusty star - forming regions .",
    "therefore , the comparison between @xmath0 and @xmath1 connects the amount of available molecular gas mass to the amount of current massive star formation .",

    "we conducted statistical non - weighted least - square fitting for all sources plotted in figure  [ high - z ] , and obtained a linear relation ( @xmath108 ) across six orders of magnitude in the co  ( 32 ) luminosity .",

    "for example , high - z smg / qsos ( gray triangles ) and nearby late stage mergers ( red diamonds ) are systematically higher than the global fit especially seen at the galaxies with higher ir - luminosity is consistent with previous observation @xcite and recovered by gmcs model prediction @xcite .",
    "the high - z normal star forming galaxies @xcite are on lower side on average .",
    "this possibly suggests that a single global relation can not explain the star formation from gma scale to high - z galaxies .",
    "in addition , we found that the average sfe of each population gradually increases from isolated galaxies , merging galaxies , and to high - z smg / qsos ( figure [ sfe - all ] ) .",
    "this may suggest that high - z smg / qsos experience on - going efficient star formation possibly due to galaxies involved in a major merger .",
    "in contrast , the average sfe of high - z normal star forming galaxies ( light blue ) are small compared to other populations , suggesting a longer lasting mode of star formation than nearby isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "finally , we note that the detailed mechanism for triggering active star - bursts between low and high redshifts may be different , since the gas mass fraction is expected to evolve as a function of redshift @xcite and global instabilities may dominate the star - burst activities in distant gas rich sources .",
    "the increase of sfe from isolated spiral , early stage mergers to late stage mergers can be interpreted in the context of simulated gas rich merging galaxies .",
    "these simulations predicted that , in addition to the global gas inflow to their nuclei and central star - busts which dominate the activity in the late stage mergers , disk wide star - bursts occur early in the tidal interaction due to the exacerbated fragmentation of dense gas @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observational results of dense gas tracers ( e.g. , hcn and hco@xmath109 ) toward interacting systems , which have shown that dense gas is ubiquitous across the merging interface between the two interacting galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a recent similar simulation @xcite suggested that all merging galaxies ( not only star - burst systems like the antennae galaxy but also lesser degree ones ) are in between the disk sequence and the star - burst sequence . assuming that the formation of disk - wide dense clumps and associated star - bursts occur early in the evolution , relatively lower sfes in the early stage than the late stage mergers suggest that such star - bursts are relatively inefficient .",
    "this is a sensible interpretation as the gas kinematics is still dominated by disk rotation at this stage , and localized clumpy star - bursts could consist only a small fraction of the disk surface . in the late stages of the merger",
    "when the two nuclei are about to merge , significant amount of material is expected to be deposited into the nuclei , where the surface density of gas can be much higher and star - bursts can be more efficient than the localized clumps formed early in the evolution .",
    "the observed higher sfe seen in the late stage mergers is consistent with this scenario .",
    "a systematic high resolution survey of diffuse and dense gas tracers in order to resolve clumps in the disks and nuclei are the key to confirm this scenario .    finally , we note that ideally one should use the @xmath72 and sfr relation instead of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 used in this study . however , the co - to - h@xmath73 conversion factor is different for star - bursting galaxies and spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the exact conversion factor may vary from source to source . on the other hand , @xcite show that the conversion factor varies smoothly during the course of a merger evolution .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1-to - sfr conversion is reasonable for star - burst galaxies but may not be applicable for galaxies with small fir luminosity , in which case the uv luminosity may be a better indicator of the sfr . in recent study , @xcite suggest that low co - to - h@xmath73 conversion factor ( @xmath110 @xmath111 ( k kms@xmath19 pc@xmath112)@xmath19 ) for star - bursting mergers due to strong ism turbulence in sb mergers . on the other hand ,",
    "their model predict that higher co - to - h@xmath73 conversion factor ( @xmath113 ) for high - z disk galaxies than star - burst mergers .",
    "nevertheless , our current data is insufficient to address this issue at present and deferred to future studies that include the analysis of the co  ( 10 ) data in the same sources .",
    "we have observed co  ( 32 ) emission toward 19 early and 7 late stage merging galaxies with aste . by including galaxies that are observed in previous studies , we compare the relation between the co  ( 32 ) and fir luminosity of 29 early stage merging galaxies , 31 late stage merging galaxies , and 28 isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "we summarize the main findings as follows ;    * the co  ( 32 ) luminosity and fir luminosity are correlated in the case of both spirals and mergers ( figure [ fir - co ] ) .",
    "we do not see an obvious bimodality in the @xmath82@xmath12 plane , which was previously suggested by e.g. , @xcite . * we suggest two different slopes between spiral galaxies and merging galaxies .",
    "the slope in the @xmath82@xmath12 plane is different between the isolated spiral galaxies ( @xmath4 ) and merging galaxies ( @xmath114 ) ( figure [ slope ] ) .",
    "* we see a modest positive correlation between fir luminosity and sfe in merging galaxies .",

    "<S> we present the new single dish co  ( 32 ) emission data obtained toward 19 early stage and 7 late stage nearby merging galaxies using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) . combining with the single dish and interferometric data of galaxies observed in previous studies , we investigate the relation between the co  ( 32 ) luminosity ( @xmath0 ) and the far infrared luminosity ( @xmath1 ) in a sample of 29 early stage and 31 late stage merging galaxies , and 28 nearby isolated spiral galaxies . we find that normal isolated spiral galaxies and merging galaxies have different slopes ( @xmath2 ) in the @xmath3 plane ( @xmath4 for spirals and @xmath5 for mergers ) . the large slope ( @xmath6 ) for merging galaxies can be interpreted as an evidence for increasing star formation efficiency ( sfe=@xmath7 ) as a function of @xmath1 . comparing our results with sub - kpc scale local star formation and global star - burst activity in the high - z universe , </S>",
    "<S> we find deviations from the linear relationship in the @xmath3 plane for the late stage mergers and high - z star forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the average sfe gradually increases from isolated galaxies , merging galaxies , and to high - z submillimeter galaxies / quasi - stellar objects ( smgs / qsos ) . by comparing our findings with the results from numerical simulations , we suggest ; ( 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> inefficient star - bursts triggered by disk - wide dense clumps occur in the early stage of interaction and ( 2 ) efficient star - bursts triggered by central concentration of gas occur in the final stage . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic high spatial resolution survey of diffuse and dense gas tracers is a key to confirm this scenario . </S>"
