    "in many practical situations where classical mechanics is enough to make a good description of a system , the interaction with a surrounding ( bath ) leads to dissipation and fluctuations .",
    "this program had also been extended to quantum mechanics  ( qm ) concluding with fundamental results which can be summarized in the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "nevertheless , if we wish to describe the quantum non - equilibrium evolution of the system the mentioned problem is inevitably outside of the scope of the previous approach .",
    "other approximations must be introduce to work out an _ open _ qm system @xcite . of importance",
    "is the analysis of the qm correlations generated during the elapse of time of the interaction with a measurement apparatus @xcite .",
    "in particular qm correlations in a bipartite system have generated much interest for various tasks such as computing @xcite , imaging and metrology @xcite .",
    "thus , the understanding of the mechanism of decoherence is an issue of great interest as it would allow progress in construction of qm devices @xcite .",
    "the effect of a thermal quantum bath @xmath1 on a microscopic system @xmath2 has in particular been much discussed , the general consensus being that @xmath1 leads to dissipation and decoherence on @xmath3 . breaking the isolation of @xmath4",
    "is then believed to significantly increase the decoherence @xcite .",
    "nevertheless if this were true for all qm  open system , no matter how small is the interaction with @xmath1 , fluctuation and dissipative effects would become very costly for the operation of qm devises as needed in quantum computation .",
    "indeed very recently it has been shown that entanglement between two qubits can be generated if the two qubits interact with a common thermal bath @xcite , also research on quantum information processing in finite dimension systems have lead to the picture of entanglement as a precious resource @xcite .",
    "additional studies concerning the analysis of a common bath vs individual baths have lead to support the idea of bath - induced correlations in markovian and non - markovian approximations @xcite .    in this context",
    "an important point of view is achieved if we could analyze systems associated with an _ infinite _ dimensional hilbert space .",
    "however this is not a simple task in dissipative quantum information theory . in this work",
    "we propose to study analytically quantum correlations between two particles in an infinite _ discrete _ dimension hilbert space , interacting with a thermal bath",
    ". then we will show that indeed the bath @xmath1 generates not only dissipation but induces coherence and correlations between particles immersed on it . in order to prove this fact we will do exact calculations on the dynamics of spinless quantum walks ( qw ) @xcite .",
    "then analytic results for the induced correlations can exactly be computed showing that @xmath1 may generates correlations between particles originally uncorrelated .",
    "this may be a breakthrough for the future implementations of experiments by using , for example , photonic devices similar to the ones of refs .",
    "peruzzo , perets . in what follows we present exact calculations to measure correlations and",
    "so to define a characteristic time - scale for a maximum coherence in the system before being wipe  out by dissipation . we prove that these correlations are of qm  nature analyzing a wigner function _ defined _ on the wannier lattice , thus we show that our results can be used to measure the quantum to classical transition as in qubit systems nielsen , physa-1 .",
    "the simplest implementation that reflects the role of a coherent superposition can be proposed in the framework of qw experiments , or its numerical simulations @xcite . a dissipative quantum walk ( dqw )",
    "has also been defined as a spinless particle moving in a lattice and interacting with a phonon bath aharanov , vk95,kempe , manuel , mm , physa-1 .",
    "these models can also be analytically extended considering a many - body description as we present here .",
    "in particular in this letter we will implement explicit calculations for a system constituted by two dqw s .",
    "therefore , our approach can be used to tackle this general problem pointing out the interplay between dissipation and bath - particle interactions .",
    "a model of two free distinguishable particles coupled to a common bath @xmath5 can be written using the wannier base in the following way .",
    "let the total hamiltonian be @xmath6@xmath7 is the _ free _ _ tight - binding _ hamiltonian ( our system @xmath4 ) @xmath8here @xmath9 are shift operators for the particles labeled @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the identity in the wannier base@xmath13@xmath14@xmath15note that a shift operator  translates each particle individually .",
    "here we have used a pair - ordered  bra - ket @xmath16 representing the particle @xmath10  at site @xmath17 and particle @xmath11  at site @xmath18 . from eqs .",

    "now , in order to study a non - equilibrium evolution for @xmath4 we write from ( [ ht ] ) , eliminating the bath variables , a dissipative quantum infinitesimal generator ( see appendix a ) . tracing out bath variables in the ohmic approximation ,",
    "we can write the markov quantum master equation ( qme ) @xcite :    @xmath29 + \\frac{d}{2}% \\left ( 2a_{12}\\rho a_{12}^{\\dag } -a_{12}^{\\dag } a_{12}\\rho -\\rho a_{12}a_{12}^{\\dag } \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{d}{2}\\left ( 2a_{12}^{\\dag } \\rho a_{12}-a_{12}a_{12}^{\\dag } \\rho -\\rho a_{12}^{\\dag } a_{12}\\right ) ,   \\label{qme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the temperature of the bath @xmath1",

    "it can be seen from eq.([qme ] ) that as @xmath37 the unitary evolution is recover .",
    "the case @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) would correspond to _ two _ random walk ( rw ) .",
    "nevertheless , for the present two - body _ quantum _ problem the classical profile when @xmath40 can not be re - obtained because correlations are induced from @xmath1 .",
    "we will solve this qme ( [ qme ] ) with a localized initial condition in the wannier lattice , i.e. , : @xmath41 .",
    "the operational calculus in the qme  will be done using wannier vector states to evaluate elements of the density matrix @xmath42 .",
    "to solve eq.([qme ] ) we apply @xmath43 from the right and @xmath44 from the left , then using eqs.(rr1 ) and ( [ rr2 ] ) the evolution equation can be written finally in terms of the usual wannier _",
