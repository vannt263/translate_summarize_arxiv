    "fe@xmath5 ( spin @xmath6 ) and cr@xmath5 ( spin @xmath7 = 3/2 ) occupy the 30 symmetric sites of an icosidodecahedron , a closed spherical structure consisting of 20 corner - sharing triangles arranged around 12 pentagons ( diamagnetic polyoxomolybdate fragments ) .",
    "this is a zero - dimensional analogue of the planar kagome lattice that is composed of corner - sharing triangles arranged around hexagons .",
    "a useful theoretical framework that has been employed@xcite in studying these magnetic molecules is based on an isotropic heisenberg model , where each magnetic ion is coupled via intra - molecular isotropic antiferromagnetic exchange to its four nearest neighbor magnetic ions , and all of the 60 intra - molecular exchange interactions are of equal strength ( henceforth , `` single-@xmath8 model'').@xcite unfortunately the quantum heisenberg model of the two magnetic molecules is intractable using either analytical or matrix diagonalization methods .",
    "nevertheless , the nearest - neighbor exchange constant for each molecule has been established by comparing experimental data above 30  k for the temperature - dependent zero - field susceptibility with data obtained by simulational methods using the quantum@xcite and classical@xcite monte carlo methods . for temperatures below about 30  k , where the quantum monte carlo method proves to be ineffective for the two magnetic molecules due to frustration effects,@xcite",
    "the classical heisenberg model is at present the only practical platform for establishing the dependence of the magnetization @xmath9 on external magnetic field @xmath3 and temperature @xmath4 . a rigorous analytical result@xcite for the classical , nearest - neighbor , single-@xmath8 heisenberg model states that , in the zero temperature limit , @xmath10 is linear in @xmath3 until @xmath10 saturates ( saturation fields @xmath11 = 17.7  t and 60.0  t for \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } and \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } , respectively ) .",
    "the practical relevance of the classical heisenberg model in describing these magnetic molecules even at low temperatures was strikingly demonstrated in an earlier experiment@xcite on \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } at 0.4  k , showing an overall linear dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath3 and its saturation at approximately 17.7  t. the ground state envisaged by the classical single-@xmath8 model is characterized by high - symmetry spin frustration . in particular , for @xmath12 , in the ground state the spins are coplanar with an angular separation of 120@xmath13 between the orientations of nearest - neighbor spins . on increasing the external field @xmath3",
    "the spin vectors gradually tilt towards the field vector , until full alignment is achieved when @xmath14 , while their projections in the plane perpendicular to the field vector retain the 120@xmath13 pattern for nearest - neighbor spins.@xcite it would be reasonable to expect that @xmath9 is an analytic function of its variables and thus @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , essentially independent of _ both _ @xmath3 and @xmath4 in these intervals , where @xmath18 is the exchange constant of the single-@xmath8 classical heisenberg model.@xcite indeed our classical monte carlo calculations confirm this behavior .    as shown here , new and crucial features of @xmath9 become accessible upon examining the differential susceptibility , @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "[ sec : sum ] we summarize our findings , discuss the broader implications of our results , and identify several open questions .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 versus @xmath4 were performed at ames laboratory on polycrystalline samples of \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } and \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } ( see experimental sections of refs .   and ) prepared by employing optimized synthesis methods and re - crystallization steps to minimize paramagnetic impurities .",
    "our data was obtained by using a self - resonating lc circuit driven by a tunnel diode.@xcite briefly , a tank circuit consisting of a small coil of inductance @xmath20 and a capacitor , @xmath21 , is kept at constant temperature of @xmath22  k. the sample is mounted on a sapphire holder , which is inserted into the coil without making contact . in the absence of the sample , the circuit resonates at the resonant frequency @xmath23 .",
    "when a sample with susceptibility @xmath24 is inserted into the coil , the resonant frequency changes from @xmath25 to @xmath26 due to the change of the coil inductance , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the total magnetic flux through the coil and @xmath29 is the current in the coil .",
    "this current generates a magnetic field of about 20  moe .",

    "this frequency is still much lower than characteristic frequencies and the response can be considered as static , i.e. , @xmath24 can be identified with @xmath0 . measured frequency shifts for the samples described in this work are of the order of 1 to 10  hz , whereas the experimental resolution of the setup is about 0.01  hz which corresponds to a smallest detectable magnetic moment of about 5  picoemu . for easy comparison with other experiments ,",
    "the measured frequency shift is proportional to the change in the total magnetic moment of the sample at a given frequency , @xmath35 , where @xmath21 is a calibration constant .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show our experimental data for @xmath0 versus @xmath4 for \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } and \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } , respectively .",
    "the calibration of the experimental data was achieved by matching the effective magnetic moment inferred from the measured frequency shift to low - field ( 3 - 50000 gs ) ac ( 10 to 1000 hz ) and dc susceptibility measurements performed on a quantum design mpms , which show that at high temperatures dynamic effects can be neglected .",
    "the assumption of static behavior is supported by the fact that all curves collapse onto each other for @xmath36 k. the most striking feature of these data is the very strong dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as remarked in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , this behavior is contrary to that predicted by the single-@xmath8 model , specifically @xmath37 , that is , @xmath0 is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the regime @xmath38 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show our experimental data for @xmath0 versus @xmath3 for both \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } ( upper panel ) and \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } ( lower panel ) .",
    "these data sets were obtained by measuring the magnetization using pulsed magnetic fields ( typical sweep rate 15000 @xmath39 ) with a standard inductive method at facilities of okayama university , tohoku university , and university of tokyo . also shown are the corresponding classical monte carlo simulational results for the single-@xmath8 model ( dashed curve ) for the indicated temperatures .",
    "[ phb ]    fig2.eps    the inadequacy of the single-@xmath8 model is striking in that the simulational data differ from the experimental data in four important ways . _ first _ , the experimental data exhibit a steep rise for decreasing low fields , and the lower the temperature the steeper the rise .",
    "this is consistent with our experimental findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp : a ] for the @xmath4- dependence of @xmath40 .",
    "these features are entirely absent for the single-@xmath8 model ; in particular , @xmath0 is essentially independent of field in the low - field regime .",

    "_ fourth _ , for \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } the experimental data for 0.42   k shows a decrease with increasing field above 10  t , quite distinct from the pattern of the single-@xmath8 model .",
    "in this section we give a qualitative explanation for our experimental findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp : a ] .",
    "we suggest that the strong sensitivity of the differential susceptibility on @xmath3 and @xmath4 reflects a non - analytic dependence of the magnetization on these variables , a characteristic already exhibited by independent classical isosceles spin triangles .",
    "the hamiltonian of a spin triangle is given in footnote   in terms of dimensionless quantities .",
    "in particular , the three pair - wise interactions are described by two different antiferromagnetic exchange constants ( positive values of @xmath8 and @xmath43 ) and we consider both cases , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    for the equilateral spin triangle ( @xmath46 at @xmath47  k the magnetic moment per triangle , @xmath48 , is a continuous , linear function of @xmath3 and , in particular , it vanishes for @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , @xmath50 for @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the saturation field .    analytical calculation of @xmath48 for the corresponding isosceles spin triangle is a non - trivial task for general values of @xmath53 as it is necessary to carefully identify the configuration of least energy for arbitrary values of @xmath3 .",
    "the final results are as follows : for the case @xmath45 : @xmath54 for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the saturation field . for the case",
    "@xmath57 : @xmath58 for @xmath59 ; @xmath60 for @xmath61 ; and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath48 is subject to the antisymmetry property @xmath64 .",
    "the discontinuous behavior for @xmath65 is of particular importance in both cases .",
    "although this discontinuity occurs only at 0  k , it is the crucial mechanism responsible for the great sensitivity of @xmath9 in the low @xmath3 - low @xmath4 regime .",
    "[ phb ]    fig3.eps    the form of @xmath66 for finite @xmath4 can , in principle , be derived for this model system by analytical methods , however these calculations are substantially more intricate than for the classical equilateral spin triangle ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] b of o. ciftja _",
    "listed in ref .  ) . for practical purposes ,",
    "the simplest procedure is to use the classical monte carlo method for convenient numerical choices of @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we display our results for the choices @xmath68  k , @xmath69  k. the most important feature to note is that while @xmath10 is indeed a continuous function of @xmath3 for any nonzero @xmath4 , the quantity @xmath0 , provided in the main portion of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , exhibits strong temperature dependence for weak magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , the curves fan with increasing @xmath3 in a manner that is strikingly similar to that shown in fig .",
    "similar behavior occurs for cases where @xmath44 .",
    "by contrast , for the corresponding classical equilateral spin triangle @xmath0 is virtually independent of @xmath4 , as is seen in fig .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath3 dependence of @xmath0 for the classical isosceles spin triangle considered in the previous section is remarkably similar to that of our experimental data in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] .",
    "however , to achieve a more realistic model , in the following we assume that the 60 nearest - neighbor exchange interactions between magnetic ions in a given molecule are characterized by a probability distribution with two adjustable width parameters . in the following section we rationalize the use of a probability distribution as a convenient way for summarizing the combined effects of multiple microscopic mechanisms that disrupt the use of an idealized , single-@xmath8 model .",

    "the motivation for using two distributions as described above is the following .",
    "one can attribute the influence of the two distributions , characterized by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , to complementary effects which only _ in combination _ lead to the observed properties of both molecules .",
    "the value of @xmath79 controls the variation in the values of the mean exchange constant _ per molecule _ , which leads to variations in the value of the saturation field @xmath81 and hence in the value of the minimum in @xmath0 versus @xmath3 at @xmath82 . by averaging over those variations",
    "one finds that @xmath0 versus @xmath3 starts to decrease at a much lower value of @xmath3 than predicted by the single-@xmath8 model and _ simultaneously _ finds that the minimum at @xmath82 is broadened as observed .",
    "however , using this distribution alone one can not explain the observed strong @xmath3 dependence of @xmath0 in the low @xmath4 - low @xmath3 regime , because each molecule is still characterized by a single exchange constant .",
    "introducing a second distribution , characterized by the parameter @xmath80 , leads to a variation in the values of the exchange constant _ within a molecule _ with the effect that the corner - sharing spin triangles are of the scalene - type rather than equilateral - type .",
    "this gives rise to the non - analytic behavior of the magnetization at @xmath12 for 0  k and hence to the characteristic effects we have found in the low @xmath3 - low @xmath4 regime . in our simulations we have studied a very large range of choices of parameter pairs .",
    "the optimal choice for \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } can be narrowed to @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 }",
    "we find @xmath85 , however @xmath86 can be chosen in the range 0 to 0.2 without any observable effect .",
    "this is due to the fact that for \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } magnetization measurements above the saturation field ( @xmath81 = 60  t ) are not achievable at the present time . in the case of \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } , for which @xmath81 = 17.7  t , the availability of magnetization data above the saturation field allows for a greatly reduced uncertainty in the value of @xmath79 .    [ phb ]",
    "fig5.eps    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are our simulational results for @xmath40 versus @xmath4 for several different values of @xmath3 using the probability distribution with optimal parameters appropriate for \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } and \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2}. these results ( black curves ) are strikingly similar to the experimental curves seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; the corresponding curves ( shown in red ) for the single-@xmath8 model , for the same choice of the mean value @xmath18 , are essentially indistinguishable from one another .",
    "this again strongly supports the existence of the multiple-@xmath8 scenario .",
    "note that , in the experiment as well as in the simulations , with increasing temperature the curves for different field values rapidly converge and become indistinguishable from one another .",
    "also , for increasing temperature , the results for the multiple-@xmath8 model merge with those of the single-@xmath8 model , as expected , since the average exchange constant across the ensemble , @xmath18 , is chosen to equal to the exchange constant of the single-@xmath8 model .",
    "finally , it remains to be seen whether the sharp rise in the curves of the upper panel of fig .  [ fig5 ] below 200  mk is an experimental feature in \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } or merely an artifact of the multiple-@xmath8 model based on a rectangular probability distribution .",
    "in this article , we have presented our experimental data for the differential susceptibility of the pair of magnetic molecules \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } and \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } as a function of magnetic field and temperature . below 5  k",
    "these data are strikingly different from what can be provided using a classical heisenberg model with a single value of the nearest - neighbor exchange constant ( single-@xmath8 model ) .",
    "we have achieved excellent agreement with our experimental data upon adopting a classical heisenberg model where the 60 nearest - neighbor interactions are not identical ; instead , the values of the exchange constants are described by a two - parameter probability distribution with a mean value as determined from experimental @xmath0 data above 30  k using the single-@xmath8 model . above 5",
    "k the single-@xmath8 model provides a satisfactory description of each molecule .    since the icosidodecahedron structure consists of corner - sharing triangles , it is not surprising that the heisenberg model of _ independent _ classical isosceles spin triangles provides a simple yet instructive model in that it exhibits the main qualitative features of our experimental data .",
    "we note here that a similar approach has been employed successfully for various two - dimensional spin systems on triangular lattices@xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of manganese tricyanomethanide the so - called ` row model ' based on _ connected _ isosceles triangles provides the explanation for an unusual magnetic - field dependence of the spin ordering@xcite . in the context of independent classical isosceles spin triangles one can figuratively describe the effect of multiple exchange constants as modifying the spin frustration from the standard @xmath87 angular separation between spin vectors of the equilateral spin triangle .",
    "the operational consequence is that the magnetization , for @xmath88 , of an isosceles spin triangle is a non - analytic function of magnetic field for @xmath12 , and this is manifested in @xmath0 being a highly sensitive function of its arguments for small @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the existence of a distribution of nearest - neighbor exchange constants can be expected to be responsible for a significant lifting of degeneracies of magnetic energy levels . to be specific",
    ", the quantum rotational band model@xcite , which is a solvable alternative to the nearest - neighbor single-@xmath8 quantum heisenberg model , predicts a discrete spectrum of energy levels , many of which have a very high degeneracy due to large multiplicity factors .",
    "perturbing this model hamiltonian by using a distribution of @xmath8-values would remove a major fraction of these degeneracies .",
    "the lifting of level degeneracies could provide a reasonable explanation for three long - standing puzzling issues concerning these magnetic molecules : the first issue is the very broad peak ( maximum at 0.6  mev ) that has been observed by inelastic neutron scattering on \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } at 65  mk . in order to qualitatively reproduce the observed peak using the rotational band model , it was necessary in ref .   to perform the calculations upon assigning a large energy width ( 0.3  mev ) for the individual energy levels .",
    "we suggest that the source of this large energy width might be the lifting of the majority of degeneracies associated with a single-@xmath8 model",
    ".    a second important consequence of the splitting of highly degenerate levels would be that the molecules could exhibit classical characteristics down to very low temperatures .",
    "this would provide a very reasonable explanation for the surprising fact that our simulational results based on the _ classical _ heisenberg hamiltonian are so successful in describing \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } , despite the fact that the cr@xmath5 ions have a small spin ( 3/2 ) . stated differently , with the lifting of degeneracies and the fanning out of energy levels the effective temperature for the crossover from classical to quantum behavior",
    "can be anticipated to be considerably lower than that expected _ a priori _ for the single-@xmath8 model .",
    "third , the failure of efforts to observe magnetization steps , in measurements of magnetization versus @xmath3 , in the mk temperature range in both \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } and \\{mo@xmath1cr@xmath2 } could also be attributed to the removal of degeneracies of the magnetic energy levels .",
    "the occurrence of magnetization steps at low temperatures is associated with the field - induced crossing of successive energy levels of the lowest rotational band . however , a discrete level associated with total spin quantum number @xmath89 has multiplicity @xmath90 [ total degeneracy @xmath91 .",
    "if this degeneracy is lifted there will be a multitude of level crossings at slightly different field values and thus give rise to blurred effects down to lower temperatures than would otherwise be expected .",
    "given the finite - spin values of the fe@xmath5 and cr@xmath5 ions , is it possible to explain the present experimental findings based on a _ quantum _ heisenberg model that adopts a common , _ single _ value of the exchange constant for all of the nearest - neighbor interactions ?",
    "we strongly doubt that this is possible , for we have seen , albeit with a _ classical _ heisenberg model , that it is the spread in values of the nearest - neighbor exchange constant that fuels the sensitive dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath4 , or equivalently the non - analytic behavior of magnetization on @xmath3 in the low @xmath3 - low @xmath4 regime .    basing our simulations on a probability distribution for the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction",
    "has led to excellent agreement with the detailed features of our experimental data including the sensitive dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "one can attribute the failure of the single-@xmath8 model to the combined effect of a large number of diverse perturbing mechanisms .",
    "the effects of impurities , variations in the exchange - coupling geometry , weak magnetic exchange interactions of more - distant neighbors , dzyaloshinsky - moriya and dipole - dipole interactions in these magnetic molecules are some of the many effects that are excluded when one uses an idealized single-@xmath8 model . on the other hand ,",
    "it is at this stage an extremely difficult , essentially impossible task to realistically quantify the effects of the diverse mechanisms . a theoretical description based on a heisenberg model where",
    "the nearest - neighbor exchange constant is chosen using a probability distribution provides a relatively simple , phenomenological platform for compromising between the need for microscopic realism versus practical limitations .",
    "ultimately it is significant that a two - parameter probability description can actually provide the level of agreement that we have found .",
    "finally , we remark that other choices of probability distributions can be expected to perform equally well .    as one example of the complications in assessing the plethora of perturbing mechanisms , we consider the variation in the intramolecular distances between nearest - neighbor magnetic ions .",
    "a geometric analysis utilizing existing low - temperature single crystal x - ray structure data for \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } molecules shows that the substructure of the magnetic ions is close to an ideal @xmath92-symmetric geometry .",
    "there is a standard deviation of 0.04525   ( 0.70% ) and a maximum deviation of 1.4% from the average fe - fe distance of 6.4493   for all 60 fe - fe nearest - neighbor distances . besides the distances between the spin centers , geometric variations within the polyoxomolybdate exchange ligand",
    "are observed .",
    "in particular the o - mo - o bond angle variations should affect the total orbital overlap and thus the exchange energy due to the spatially anisotropic character of the ( unoccupied ) mo(4d ) orbitals . for \\{mo@xmath1fe@xmath2 } , an angular range @xmath93 is observed , which in part is caused by crystallographic disorder of mo positions . to assess the influence of various geometric parameters involved in the superexchange pathways between two nearest - neighbor spin centers , both binding to a pentagonal diamagnetic [ mo@xmath94o@xmath95(h@xmath96o)@xmath97@xmath98 = \\{mo@xmath99 } fragment , we performed systematic density functional theory - broken symmetry calculations@xcite on a model system in which two @xmath7 = 1/2 [ v@xmath100o(h@xmath96o)@xmath96]@xmath102 groups are coordinated to such a \\{mo@xmath99 } fragment in a nearest - neighbor ( 1,2 ) configuration .",

    "<S> excellent agreement with experiment is achieved upon formulating a nearest - neighbor classical heisenberg model where the 60 nearest - neighbor exchange interactions in each molecule , rather than being identical as has been assumed heretofore , are described by a two - parameter rectangular probability distribution of values of the exchange constant . </S>",
