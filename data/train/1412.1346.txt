    "the theory of positional games on graphs and hypergraphs goes back to the seminal papers of hales and jewett  @xcite , of lehman  @xcite and of erds and selfridge  @xcite .",
    "it has since become a highly developed area of combinatorics ( see , e.g. , the monograph of beck  @xcite and the recent monograph  @xcite ) .",
    "the most popular and widely studied positional games are the so - called maker - breaker games .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath2 be positive integers , let @xmath0 be a finite set and let @xmath10 be a family of subsets of @xmath0 . in each round of the biased @xmath11 maker - breaker game @xmath4 , maker claims @xmath9",
    "previously unclaimed elements of @xmath0 and then breaker responds by claiming @xmath2 previously unclaimed elements of @xmath0 . maker wins this game if , by the time every element of @xmath0 has been claimed , he has claimed all elements of some set @xmath6 ; otherwise breaker is the winner . the set @xmath0 is called the _ board _ of the game , the elements of @xmath10 are called the _ winning sets _ and the integers @xmath9 and @xmath2 are maker s bias and breaker s bias , respectively . since this is a finite , perfect information game with no chance moves and no possibility of a draw , one of the two players must have a winning strategy .",
    "moreover , it is not hard to see that maker - breaker games are _ bias monotone _ , that is , claiming more board elements than his bias specifies per round can not harm that player .",
    "in particular , there exists a unique positive integer @xmath12 such that breaker has a winning strategy for the @xmath3 game @xmath4 if and only if @xmath13 ; we refer to this integer as the _ threshold bias _ of the maker - breaker game @xmath4",
    ".    the so - called avoider - enforcer games form another class of well - studied positional games . in such games",
    ", enforcer aims to force avoider to claim all elements of some set @xmath6 .",
    "avoider - enforcer games are sometimes referred to as misre maker - breaker games .",
    "there are two different sets of rules for avoider - enforcer games : _ strict rules _ under which the number of board elements a player claims per round is precisely his bias and _ monotone rules _ under which the number of board elements a player claims per round is at least as large as his bias ( for more information on avoider - enforcer games see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "one major motivation for studying biased maker - breaker and avoider - enforcer games is their relation to the theory of random graphs via the so - called _",
    "probabilistic intuition_. consider , for example , a @xmath3 maker - breaker game @xmath4 , where @xmath14 is the edge - set of the complete graph on @xmath15 vertices .",
    "the following heuristic argument , first employed by chvtal and erds in  @xcite , can be used to predict the winner of this game .",
    "this heuristic suggests that the player who has a higher chance to win the game when both players are playing randomly is also the one who wins the game when both players are playing optimally .",
    "more precisely , if the random graph @xmath16 with @xmath17 edges contains all edges of some @xmath6 with probability tending to @xmath18 as @xmath15 tends to infinity , then maker has a winning strategy for @xmath19 .",
    "if , on the other hand , this probability tends to @xmath20 as @xmath15 tends to infinity , then @xmath19 is breaker s win .",
    "this is highly unexpected as , in any positional game , both players have deterministic optimal strategies",
    ". moreover , in most natural games , playing randomly against an optimal opponent leads to very poor results .",
    "as noted above , this is just a heuristic and does not always predict the outcome of the game correctly .",
    "nevertheless , the probabilistic intuition is remarkably useful .",
    "natural examples where this heuristic predicts the winner correctly , include the connectivity game ( that is , @xmath10 consists of all connected subgraphs of @xmath21 )  @xcite and the hamiltonicity game ( that is , @xmath10 consists of all hamiltonian subgraphs of @xmath21 )  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that the probabilistic intuition fails ( though another probabilistic reasoning is in play here ) for the @xmath22-game ( that is , @xmath10 consists of all copies of some fixed predetermined graph @xmath22 in @xmath21 ) .",
    "the probabilistic intuition is also useful when analyzing biased avoider - enforcer games ( especially under monotone rules ) .",
    "some examples can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .    in this paper , we study _ waiter - client _ and _ client - waiter _ positional games .",
    "such games are closely related to maker - breaker and avoider - enforcer games ; the main difference being the process of selecting board elements . in every round of the biased @xmath11 waiter - client game @xmath4 , the first player , called waiter , offers the second player , called client , @xmath23 previously unclaimed elements of @xmath0 .",
    "client then chooses @xmath9 of these elements which he claims , and the remaining @xmath2 elements are claimed by waiter . if , in the final round of the game , only @xmath24 unclaimed elements remain , then client chooses @xmath25 elements which he claims and the remaining @xmath26 elements are claimed by waiter .",
    "the game ends as soon as all elements of @xmath0 have been claimed .",
    "waiter wins this game if he manages to force client to claim all elements of some @xmath6 ; otherwise client is the winner .",
    "client - waiter games are defined analogously , the main difference being that client wins if and only if he manages to claim all elements of some @xmath6 ( otherwise waiter is the winner ) .",
    "additionally , there are two technical differences between client - waiter and waiter - client games .",
    "firstly , in a client - waiter game , waiter is allowed to offer less board elements per round than his bias specifies .",
    "more precisely , in every round of a @xmath11 client - waiter game , waiter offers @xmath27 elements , where @xmath28 .",
    "client chooses @xmath9 of these , which he keeps , and the remaining @xmath29 elements are claimed by waiter .",
    "secondly , if there are @xmath30 free elements offered to client in the final round of the game , he first claims @xmath31 of these and any remaining elements are claimed by waiter . as with maker - breaker games , it is not hard to see that waiter - client games are monotone in waiter s bias @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , essentially any waiter - client game @xmath4 has a threshold bias , that is , a unique positive integer @xmath12 such that client has a winning strategy for the @xmath3 waiter - client game @xmath4 if and only if @xmath13 . from the way that client - waiter games have been defined ,",
    "it is obvious that they also have a threshold bias ( as observed in  @xcite , this does not remain true if we require waiter to offer exactly @xmath23 board elements per round ) .",
    "the threshold bias of the client - waiter game @xmath4 is the unique positive integer @xmath12 such that waiter has a winning strategy for the @xmath3 game if and only if @xmath13 .    waiter - client and client - waiter games were first defined and studied by beck under the names picker - chooser and chooser - picker , respectively ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , since _ picking _ and _ choosing _ are essentially the same , we feel that the names waiter and client , which first appeared in  @xcite , help the reader to distinguish more easily between the roles of the two players .    as with maker - breaker and avoider - enforcer games ,",
    "the probabilistic intuition turns out to be useful for waiter - client games as well .",
    "in particular , it is known to hold for the @xmath7-game ( and in fact , for many other fixed graph games )  @xcite , for the diameter two game ( that is , the winning sets are the edge - sets of all subgraphs of @xmath21 with diameter at most two )  @xcite and for the giant component game ( that is , the game on @xmath32 in which waiter tries to force client to build a connected component on as many vertices as possible )  @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of several natural @xmath3 waiter - client and client - waiter games , played on @xmath32 .",
    "for both the waiter - client and client - waiter versions , we will study the non - planarity game @xmath33 , where @xmath34 consists of all non - planar subgraphs of @xmath21 , the @xmath7-minor game @xmath35 , where @xmath36 consists of all subgraphs of @xmath21 that admit a @xmath7-minor , and the non-@xmath8-colorability game @xmath37 , where @xmath38 consists of all non-@xmath8-colorable subgraphs of @xmath21 .",
    "the analogous maker - breaker and avoider - enforcer games were studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that , if @xmath39 , then when playing a @xmath3 maker - breaker game on @xmath32 , breaker can force maker to build a forest , that is , breaker has a winning strategy for the @xmath3 game @xmath36 , for every @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , it was proved in  @xcite that , for every fixed @xmath41 , there exists a constant @xmath42 such that , if @xmath43 , then maker has a winning strategy for the @xmath3 maker - breaker game @xmath36 for every @xmath44 .",
    "the strict avoider - enforcer minor game was considered in  @xcite as well .",
    "it was proved there that , if @xmath43 , then enforcer has a winning strategy for the @xmath3 game @xmath36 for every @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a function of @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "improving a result from  @xcite , it was recently proved in  @xcite that , if @xmath48 , then avoider has a winning strategy for the @xmath3 game @xmath36 , for every @xmath49 .    as with maker - breaker games , we are able to determine the asymptotic value of the threshold bias of the waiter - client minor game ( it is twice as large as the corresponding threshold of maker - breaker games ) . moreover , in contrast to the aforementioned results for maker - breaker games , the accuracy of our results increases as the order of the minor waiter aims to force in client s graph decreases .",
    "additionally , we can prove that , even when playing with a bias which is arbitrarily close to @xmath15 , waiter can force client to build a @xmath7-minor for @xmath50 . this order of magnitude is best possible as , at the end of the game , client s graph will contain @xmath51 edges .",

    "theorem  [ th::wcminor ] exhibits a very strong probabilistic intuition ; stronger than the aforementioned corresponding results for maker - breaker and avoider - enforcer games in several respects .",
    "indeed , it is well known ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) that if @xmath58 for an arbitrarily small but fixed @xmath41 , then asymptotically almost surely ( or a.a.s . for brevity ) every connected component of the random graph @xmath59 which clearly highlights that client s graph and the random graph it is compared to , have the same number of edges .",
    "however , for convenience , we will work with the much more commonly used binomial random graph model @xmath59 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "it is known that , for our purposes , both models are equivalent ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "theorem  [ th::wcminor ] shows that , for every @xmath62 , the threshold bias of the waiter - client @xmath7-minor game is @xmath63 .",
