    "<S> we propose to study the impact parameter dependence of the @xmath0 ratio in pb(160agev)+pb reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 ratio is a sensible tool to distinguish between hadronic cascade models and hydrodynamical models , which incorporate a qgp phase transition .    </S>",

    "<S> unambiguous signals of a phase transition into an equilibrated deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) state are still missing : the predicted change in observables , e.g. strangeness enhancement @xcite , may also be understood in hadronic non - equilibrium transport models @xcite .    in this letter , </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath4 ratio is sensitive only to the temperature and chemical potentials achieved in the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic transport theory , however , is not constrained by equilibrium assumptions . thus , this ratio provides a sensible tool to probe the creation of a chemically equilibrated phase in nucleus - nucleus collisions as a function of centrality . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to upcoming data by the na49 and the ceres collaborations may therefore provide an estimate of the degree of local chemical equilibration . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in the predicted centrality dependence among the discussed models can help to determine the applicability of these theories .    in the 3-fluid hydrodynamical model @xcite @xcite an equation of state with a first order phase transition to a qgp </S>",

    "<S> we employ that model to calculate entropy production during the initial stage of the reaction as described in detail in  @xcite . to show the behaviour of the @xmath0 ratio for the chemical equilibrium case , the creation of a fireball , composed of all hadrons up to mass @xmath5  gev , with a uniform @xmath6 ratio ( entropy @xmath7 per net participating baryon @xmath8 ) and net baryon density @xmath9 is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-fluid model is used to calculate @xmath6 as a function of impact parameter b. the hadron ratios are calculated assuming chemical isochronous freeze - out at a net baryon density @xmath10 .    for @xmath11 , which is the relevant @xmath6 range for sps energies , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 ratio is practically unchanged if a chemical freeze - out temperature of @xmath12  mev ( as suggested in  @xcite ) is employed instead of the freeze - out density @xmath10 ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> the non - equilibrium dynamics is treated in a microscopic hadronic scenario . </S>",

    "<S> [ alap ] shows the @xmath0 ratio for different impact parameters from 0  fm to 13  fm ( urqmd ) and 0  fm to 9  fm ( 3-fluid hydro+fireball ; for larger impact parameters , the assumption of a chemically equilibrated fireball may not be justified ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamical calculation with phase transition is depicted by the black line ( using a freeze - out density @xmath10 ) and the dotted line ( using a freeze - out temperature @xmath12  mev ) , the full squares denote the - microscopic non - equilibrium - urqmd @xcite calculation .    in the 3-fluid approach </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 ratio stays constant with b.    in contrast , the hadronic urqmd model yields a strong dependence of this ratio on impact parameter b. the @xmath13 ratio drops rapidly with increasing b from 1.3 to 0.5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the 3-fluid hydrodynamical model can be understood in terms of the local equilibration of the hot and dense medium . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and specific entropy of the fluid elements are only slightly affected by b ( at least for not too large impact parameters ) . as long as the assumption of local chemical equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> is justified , the particle number densities are independent of the volume ( in the grand canonical formulation ) - thus their ratios remain constant .    in the case of the microscopic urqmd model , there is an interplay between particle production and subsequent annihilation : in peripheral ( large b ) collisions the @xmath3 production is basically the same as in proton+proton reactions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 s and @xmath2 s are produced via the fragmentation of color flux tubes ( strings ) . </S>",
    "<S> the production of ( anti-)strange quarks in the color field is suppressed due to the mass difference between strange and up / down quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a suppression of @xmath3 over @xmath2 by a factor of 2 ( @xmath14 in pp ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in central pb+pb encounters meson - baryon and meson - meson reactions work as additional sources for the anti - hyperon and anti - proton production . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute @xmath3 , @xmath2 yield increases far above the naive p+p extrapolation . </S>",
    "<S> then , additional rescattering effects have to be taken into account in the hot and dense medium . </S>",
    "<S> anti - baryons are strongly affected by the comoving baryon density . </S>",
    "<S> the additive quark model yields smaller annihilation cross section of anti - lambdas than the annihilation cross sections of anti - protons at the same momentum : thus the annihilation probability for @xmath3 s is smaller than for @xmath2 s , leading to an increase of the @xmath0 ratio above 1 in very central reactions .    in conclusion , it has been demonstrated that a study of the impact parameter dependence of the @xmath0 ratio can be used as a powerful tool to distingush local equilibrium from off - equilibrium models for heavy ion collisions . </S>"
