    "nonlinear optics is the study of quantum systems with polarizations that are nonlinear functions of external electromagnetic fields .",
    "it is about a year younger than the age of the laser , a little over fifty years old .",
    "lasers are ubiquitous in daily life .",
    "nonlinear optics has offered scientific research numerous methods for studying materials and measuring their quantum properties , but nonlinear optical materials with large optical responses and low loss , required for most devices , remain elusive@xcite .",
    "the scientific field has spanned decades of fundamental and applied research on the interactions of strong electromagnetic fields with naturally occurring solid@xcite , liquid@xcite , liquid crystal@xcite or gaseous materials@xcite , as well as photonic crystals , mesoscopic solid state wires@xcite , and other artificial systems@xcite .",
    "the theory of nonlinear optics is well - established and has recently been reviewed in the literature@xcite .",
    "this paper is a concise review of our present understanding of the physics of the theory of the fundamental limits of nonlinear optics with an eye toward understanding why it is that nearly all molecular systems fall short of the quantum limits and how this discovery , made in 2000 by m.g .",
    "kuzyk@xcite has advanced our understanding of the origin of the limits themselves and the design rules required for the molecular response to approach the limits .",
    "the nonlinear optical response of a material is generated by the collective response of the basic elements comprising it .",
    "semiconductor nonlinear optics results from excitation of electrons in compound materials@xcite , while the response of a dye doped polymer results from the collective response of the moieties embedded into the polymer matrix@xcite .",
    "this review concerns the maximum values of the nonlinear optical response of a molecular - scale structure , not a material .",
    "the ground state dipole moment in the presence of an electric field @xmath0 is expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is ith component of the unperturbed ground state dipole moment vector , @xmath3 is the linear polarizability tensor , @xmath4 is the first hyperpolarizability tensor@xcite , and @xmath5 is the second hyperpolarizability tensor@xcite . in eqn [ polvec ] and throughout this paper , repeated tensor indices are summed .",
    "the tensors contain all of the physics of the interaction of a molecule s nuclei and electrons with light or a static electric field , and their tensor structure reflects the rotational properties of the molecule under the proper orthogonal rotation group @xmath6 , as well as inversion through some origin@xcite . the tensors are calculable using perturbation theory , finite fields , and other numerical methods described later in this review .",
    "in perturbation theory , the three tensors depend on the energy levels , the dipole transition matrix elements , and the linewidths of the levels . in this review ,",
    "we denote the energies by @xmath7 and most often use the energy difference @xmath8 between the excited state n and the ground state .",
    "the transition moments are expressed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 . finally , the natural linewidths are generally a complex function of the quantum properties of the states , but may be written using fermi s golden rule@xcite as a product of the cube of the energy and the absolute square of the transition moment . in this review , we ll focus on off - resonance responses , as it clears away some of the complexity that can obscure the essential physics of limit theory without loss of generality .",
    "references to the general case are provided as we go along .",
    "the computation of the linear polarizability , and the first and second hyperpolarizabilities , in perturbation theory , was first published by orr and ward@xcite , as a sum over unperturbed states .",
    "symmetries of the structures provide constraints on the nonlinear response and can enhance , reduce , or zero it .",
    "topological properties generally affect the nature of the energy spectrum and its dependence on the eigenmode number .",
    "geometrical properties primarily affect the magnitude of the transition moments and the nature of the sum over states .",
    "the scientist synthesizing new molecules with the goal of achieving large responses at specific optical frequencies has an array of options with which to work .",
    "an additional key element is the scale of the molecule : larger , self - similar structures might have larger responses , but materials using these elements have lower number densities of them , resulting in limited benefit to the use of size as a design element .",
    "for this reason , it is imperative to examine the large design space for molecular structures in a scale - independent way .",
    "this immediately raises two questions : how large can this _ intrinsic _ response be , and how well do present molecular elements perform ?",
    "the theory of fundamental limits is a body of work created specifically to answer these questions@xcite .",
    "a basic question the reader should be asking is why there are any limits at all . to answer this in a simple way , consider the linear polarizability @xmath3 whose sum over states in the off - resonant limit is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a permutation operator over the two cartesian indices and the prime on the sum means skip @xmath13 .",
    "this tensor is a sum of terms containing transition moments and energy levels .",
    "the spectra and eigenstates are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors found by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath14 , and the transition moments @xmath15 are computed from the eigenstates .",
    "spectra and moments are intimately related and not independent of one another .",
    "this relation is expressed concisely through the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rules@xcite .",
    "the trk sum rules are a consequence of the commutators between the position operators and the commutator of those operators with the hamiltonian @xmath14 , where the position and momentum operators satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath16=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian may depend on other parameters , such as external electromagnetic potentials , but if it satisfies the basic commutator @xmath17=-(\\hbar^2/m)\\delta_{ij}$ ] _ and _ its eigenstates satisfy completeness and closure , then by inserting a complete set of states between the operators in the double commutator , one gets the trk sum rules . for the x component ,",
    "these are @xmath18 where @xmath19=e_{pn}+e_{pm}\\ ] ] the summation spans the complete set of eigenstates of the system , including both discrete and continuum @xcite states , and degenerate and non - degenerate states @xcite . in eqn [ trksumrule ]",
    ", @xmath20 is the number of participating electrons , and @xmath21 is the electron mass .",
    "the commutator @xmath22=i\\hbar p^{i}/m$ ] is familiar to students of introductory quantum theory , where @xmath23 is often written as @xmath24 in the presence of a potential function .",
    "but the sum rule commutator @xmath17=-(\\hbar^2/m)\\delta_{ij}$ ] holds for a larger class of hamiltonians that include interactions with electromagnetic fields , and a rather novel set of so - called _ exotic _ hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "this would seem to encompass all possible physical non - relativistic hamiltonians .    to see the impact of the sum rules on eqn [ alphaij ] , consider the xx component .",
    "eqn [ alphaij ] becomes @xmath25 but from eqn [ epnm ] with @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 , and eqn [ trksumrule ] yields @xmath28 using eqn [ trk00 ] in eqn [ alphaxx ] gives us an upper limit on the x - diagonal polarizability tensor : @xmath29 thus , the sum rules have acted as constraints to reveal an upper limit to polarizability tensor that depends solely on the energy level splitting between the ground and first excited state , and the number of participating electrons .",
    "this is an exact result .",
    "the sum rules are an infinite set of equations in an infinite number of variables . in principle",
    ", one could solve @xmath30 for the stationary states of the structure , compute the transition moments , and verify the validity of eqn [ trksumrule ] .",
    "the veracity of the sum rules is inviolate , making them an exceptional tool for verifying computations .",
    "but they are evidently a tool for constraining the spectra and moments appearing in sum over states expressions , as just demonstrated for the first polarizability tensor .",
    "kuzyk pioneered the use of sum rules for the purpose of examining their effect as constraints on the nonlinear optical tensors , leading for the first time to a quantitative statement of the limits of the size of nonlinear optical tensors , which revealed that all experimental work known up to the time of publication of this work fell a factor of 30 below the limits@xcite .",
    "this discovery , its history , progress in its development , and open questions are the subject of this review .",
    "section [ sec : history ] details the development of the theory of fundamental limits ( tfl ) .",
    "the discussion mirrors the original method to elucidate subtleties that are often overlooked by those using the tfl .",
    "the three - level approximation for @xmath31 is introduced and its reduction to the three - level model via truncated sum rules is described .",
    "the theory revealed a gap of a factor of 30 between all experiments as of the year 2000 and the limits , the so - called kuzyk gap .",
    "the validity of the tfl is discussed , and the concept of the three - level ansatz ( tla ) is introduced and its role in the theory is described .",
    "scaling and universality in the tfl is summarized and its meaning explored .",
    "the section closes with a history of experiments and models targeted at understanding the limits and to close the kuzyk gap in the post - tfl years .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents theoretical advances toward understanding the limits and achieving them in molecular systems .",
    "theoretical advances include potential optimization and monte carlo simulations , which result in identifying key features of the spectrum of a good molecule .",
    "the two methods predict different upper limits for the intrinsic nonlinearities , creating a new sort of gap and new challenges to understand it .",
    "most models studied are one - dimensional .",
    "the application of the tfl to quasi - one dimensional quantum graphs that exist in two spatial dimensions is invoked to illustrate that the three - level ansatz holds for @xmath31 but does not hold for @xmath32 , which requires four states , despite the fact that the maximum value of @xmath32 is derived using only three states .",
    "section [ sec : issues ] addresses outstanding issues in the theory of fundamental limits .",
    "the first concerns the gap in predicted limits between physical systems described by a generalized hamiltonian ( and its spectra and states ) with the canonical commutation relation required to generate sum rules , and the limits predicted by using the sum rules alone and selecting spectra and moments at random with sum rules as constraints .",
    "the second concerns the tla and its relationship to the tfl .",
    "a third concerns new design methods gleaned from the tfl .",
    "a fourth is the application of the tfl to device figures of merit .",
    "the section closes with a concise analysis of what we know about the tfl today , and what remains to be discovered .",
    "section [ sec : end ] closes the review with a summary of the main results and a personal perspective based upon several years of work on the theory of fundamental limits using quantum graphs .",
    "the author emphasizes that this article is a brief review of the theory of the fundamental limits of nonlinear optics from his own perspective , for the purposes of providing a framework for readers of the papers in this special issue .",
    "a comprehensive review may be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the theory of the fundamental limits of nonlinear optics was first developed by kuzyk over fifteen years ago@xcite for the first hyperpolarizability tensor and later extended by him to the second hyperpolarizability tensor@xcite for off - resonant nonlinear optics .",
    "the approach was not without controversy@xcite , as it used truncated sum rules to compute an upper limit to @xmath31 , and lower and upper limits to @xmath32 .",
    "fifteen years after his breakthrough efforts , this topic was thoroughly explored by kuzyk in a tour du force work on handling pathologies in truncated sum rules@xcite . but fundamental issues remain and will be discussed in section [ sec : issues ] .",
    "an exact computation of the limits imposed by the tfl starts with the full tensor expressions of the hyperpolarizabilities , written in first order perturbation theory as a sum over states@xcite .",
    "far from resonance , the tensor components of the first hyperpolarizability , @xmath4 are given by @xmath33 where the prime indicates that the ground state is excluded from the summation , the superscripts @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 can take on @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 ( the cartesian components ) , @xmath40 permutes all the indices in the expression , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the energy between two eigenstates @xmath43 and @xmath21 .",
    "given the similarity of this form to that for @xmath3 in eqn [ alphaij ] , it seems reasonable to expect that sum rules of the form eqn [ trksumrule ] may provide sufficient constraints to restrict the maximum value of any of the tensor components in eqn [ betaijk ] .",
    "this was first demonstrated by kuzyk@xcite , in a method detailed here .",
    "consider the x - diagonal component of @xmath4 and call it @xmath31 for simplicity .",
    "then we may write @xmath44+\\cdots\\right)\\nonumber \\\\",
    "& \\equiv & \\beta_{11 } + \\beta_{22 } + [ \\beta_{12}+c.c]+\\cdots\\equiv \\beta_{3l}+\\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which defines @xmath45 as the sum over states arising from transitions involving only three energy levels , and @xmath46 plus contributions from all terms with higher levels .",
    "the first two terms are dipolar terms , expressible as a @xmath47 spherical tensor@xcite , where as the third term is an octupolar term with @xmath48 . a priori",
    ", there is no reason to assume that three terms would be sufficient to compute @xmath31 under any circumstances  it is simply a partial sum of @xmath31 that involves only the first three levels .",
    "the energy differences and transition moments in @xmath31 and @xmath45 satisfy the full trk sum rules .    to derive a limit , kuzyk@xcite truncated the sum rules to three - levels , too , and then wrote each of the three terms in @xmath45 as functions of @xmath49 alone as follows . from eqn [ trksumrule",
    "] , we find @xmath50,\\ ] ] @xmath51,\\ ] ] @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the shift in the dipole moment .",
    "all of the equalities in eqns [ s00]-[s02 ] are approximate , and there is no a priori reason to assume that the remaining terms on the right - hand side of these equations are vanishingly small .",
    "however , the sum rules do converge , so eventually the general term of each asymptotes to zero .",
    "[ as an aside , we note that the original letter computed the upper limit to @xmath31 in a two state model by taking the limit of the approach we are following as @xmath55 .",
    "this limit exists , but the two level model , with sum rules truncated to two states , requires either @xmath56 or @xmath57 and predicts @xmath31 is exactly zero .",
    "we are obligated , then , to consider at least three states when seeking an upper bound for @xmath31 . ]",

    "eqn [ betamax ] is the maximum value of @xmath67 . dividing it into @xmath31 yields",
    "the _ intrinsic _ first hyperpolarizability , a number that is always less than unity and is dimensionless and scale - independent .",
    "this is the primary result of the original letter on the tfl@xcite .",
    "but it is not immediately evident that @xmath77 is a limit on anything other than @xmath67 , the three - level model for which is was calculated .",
    "first , it was calculated using sum rules that are only approximately valid .",
    "truncation of the sum rules to three levels in order to replace the transition moments in @xmath45 with those in eqns [ x02]-[x02xbar22 ] has , a priori , little justification .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that sum rule truncation to three levels leads to @xmath78\\ ] ] which is manifestly violated for any values of the energies and transition moments on the right hand side .",
    "the pathologies introduced by working with truncated sum rules to calculate limits was the subject of a rather lengthy paper by kuzyk@xcite .",
    "an equally insightful work@xcite showed how it is possible to generate larger maxima in a four state model , and in fact create a catastrophic growth in the maximum in an n - state model as n becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "the n - state catastrophe requires what are likely an unphysical set of spectra and states , but it is not mathematically ruled out .",
    "given this , what are we to make of the limits discovered using the three - level model ?",
    "to make sense of his approach , kuzyk posited that @xmath79 when @xmath31 is near its maximum  that is , at its maximum , only three levels are required to capture most or all of @xmath31 .",
    "this is the three - level ansatz ( tla ) .",
    "the tla is not exact , but instead asserts that the maximum hyperpolarizability results when nearly all of the oscillator strength resides in transitions involving the ground state and two excited states .",
    "we know the tla can not be exact , because the sum rules are not exact with three levels .",
    "but @xmath31 converges faster than the sum rules , and it is at least believable that @xmath31 might get close to its maximum value using only three levels , while convergence of the sum rules requires many more levels .",
    "we still have a problem , namely to show that @xmath80 . if true , then the full sum over states value of @xmath31 , calculated with a set @xmath81 that satisfy the full sum rules approaches @xmath45 as @xmath31 approaches its maximum , and this will be bounded by @xmath77 .",
    "but @xmath80 is not easily proved , because the spectra and moments used to calculate each factor differ .",
    "@xmath45 is calculated using the actual spectra and moments for the problem , while @xmath67 is calculated using approximate moments given in eqns [ x02]-[x02xbar22 ] .",
    "fortunately , every model system calculated to date for @xmath31 satisfies the tla and also has @xmath80 .",
    "figure [ fig : betalimitfig ] , an update of an original plot in kuyzk s letter@xcite plots the value of @xmath82 , in esu , against the wavelength associated with the @xmath83 level transition . the dots are experimental efish measurements@xcite and represent all of known measurements at that time .",
    "as the figure implies , the data lie below an apparent or empirical boundary . the thick solid line labeled _ three - level model limit _",
    "was published in the ( corrected ) original figure@xcite and represents the three - level model prediction of the tfl in eqn [ betamax ] , derived using truncated sum rules .",
    "this was the first published evidence that there may be much more opportunity to synthesize better molecules , if one could learn what properties of the molecules cause their hyperpolarizability to rise toward the limit .",
    "the ( green ) data points appearing below the ( blue ) dashed line labeled _ empirical boundary _ are values measured by efish@xcite .",
    "the thick solid ( red ) line labeled _ three - level model limit _ is that predicted by eqn [ betamax ] .",

    "it falls about @xmath84 short of the three - level model limit .",
    "since the hamiltonian is required to generate the sum rules in the first place , the hamiltonian limit may be the exact limit .",
    "the three - level model limit , calculated with a truncated sum over states and truncated sum rules , is approximate at best and may overestimate the actual limit .",
    "a class of unconventional hamiltonians has not been explored and may generate a maximum response that falls in the limit gap , a topic discussed in section [ sec : issues ] .",
    "we can assert that the actual limit lies between the two limit lines depicted in fig [ fig : betalimitfig ] . with the discovery of a limit , @xmath77 , the first hyperpolarizability tensor @xmath4 may be normalized , @xmath85 to create an intrinsic first hyperpolarizability tensor .",
    "we will often focus on the x - diagonal component of @xmath31 and will assume it has been divided by @xmath77 to yield an intrinsic first hyperpolarizability @xmath86 , by definition .",
    "_ in this review , we will use @xmath31 as the intrinsic first hyperpolarizability , going forward_.    in the meantime , the reader s preoccupation might be on figure [ fig : betalimitfig ] and how it is possible that nearly all experimental work published prior to 2000 fell a factor of 30 below the theoretical maximum .",
    "the three - level model can provide some insight into this , as follows .",
    "recall that eqn [ betamax ] was derived by starting with the full sum over states , truncated it to three levels , and invoking constraints from truncated sum rules to eliminate all but the @xmath49 transition moment .",
    "this is a true three - level model , because both the sos and the sum rules are truncated to three levels .",
    "figure [ fig : xefgsurfaceplot ] shows the dependence of the three level @xmath87 on the two parameters x and e. x measures the relative strength of the transition moment between the ground and first excited states , while e measures the ratio of the level difference @xmath83 to @xmath88 . as @xmath89 approaches unity ,",

    "monte carlo simulations have discovered the optimum energy spectrum scaling , but not the optimum way to control eigenfunctions so that their transition moments are optimized .",
    "a natural extension of the tfl is to determine the limits of composite operators , such as real(@xmath31)/imag(@xmath146 ) , which is a figure of merit ( fom ) for an electro - optic device .",
    "computation of the fom of optical devices such as all - optical switches and modulators should lead to interesting new design rules .",
    "each of these is discussed with the spirit of encouraging graduate students and researchers to tackle them .",
    "the existence of a hamiltonian @xmath23 satisfying the commutation relation @xmath17=-(\\hbar^2/m)\\delta_{ij}$ ] leads directly to the trk sum rules in eqn [ trksumrule ] .",
    "the sets of spectra and transition moments @xmath81 computed from this hamiltonian will satisfy the sum rules , and when they are optimized and used in the sum over states for the intrinsic @xmath31 or @xmath32 , they yield maximum intrinsic value of @xmath147 , while @xmath148 .",
    "this holds for all potential models studied to date .",
    "the selection of sets of spectra and transition moments @xmath81 at random but constrained by the trk sum rules leads to a maximum intrinsic value of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "this is true provided that the three - level ansatz ( tla ) is valid .",
    "it is possible to violate these limits with pathological spectra which violate the tla@xcite , but these violations are nonphysical if the tla is valid . for the moment , we have no reason to question the validity of the tla , as it holds in every model studied to date .    these two maxima for @xmath31 were displayed in figure [ fig : betalimitfig ] , where the separation between them , the _ limit _",
    "gap , is evident .",
    "an interesting theoretical question is whether the states and spectra of an exotic hamiltonian will produce limits which lie in the limit gap .",
    "such a hamiltonian will take the three dimensional form@xcite @xmath151 where @xmath152 $ ] , @xmath153 $ ] , and @xmath154 are arbitrary tensor functions of the position operators with ranks indicated by their indices .",
    "this is the most general hamiltonian for which the trk sum rules are valid .",
    "note that the quantum mechanical version of this hamiltonian must be made hermitian before it is used to generate any physics .    in quantum graph models",
    ", it is found that the sum rules for a graph with a maximum near the hamiltonian limit @xmath147 has a @xmath31 function that differs from the three - level model and only aligns with the three - level sum over states when @xmath31 is near that maximum .",
    "figure [ fig:1delta_beta3l_beta_fg_partialsums ] illustrates this for the @xmath126 atom with potential @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",
    "the full three level model and the exact sum over states converge nearly everywhere above @xmath157 , where the maximum of @xmath158 is attained . below this value of g ,",
    "the two expressions diverge slightly .",
    "but the three level model is in error at the maximum by at least 30@xmath159 .",
    "the failure of one of the sum rules @xmath58 used in the three - level model is shown in the figure , where it is seen that this basic sum rule requires at least five levels to get near its exact value of unity .",
    "the figure illustrates both the operation of the tla , and the fact that the tla itself is not exact : the sum rules always require more states to converge to a few percent of their actual values , while the hyperpolarizabilities can get to within a few percent with only three ( @xmath31 ) or four ( @xmath32 ) states .",
    "the results will be similar for any of the potential models discussed in section [ sec : results ] , none of which were exotic hamiltonians .",
    "the problem to be solved is then this : starting with an exotic hamiltonian , solve for the spectra and eigenstates , construct the transition moments , compute @xmath31 using the sum over states , optimize the potential such that @xmath31 reaches its maximum , and see if it exceeds @xmath160 .",
    "at the same time , study the convergence of the sum rules with three levels to see how close they get to their correct values .",
    "this is an intellectual exercise , but the knowledge gained is significant .",
    "the practical value may be limited , because if a newly synthesized molecule gets to the hamiltonian limit , we do nt much care if it can get a little above that .",
    "this statement may change someday if we learn how to routinely design molecules whose maximum intrinsic nonlinearities approach the limits",
    ". that day may not be far off .    , the three - level sum @xmath45 , and the three - level @xmath161 for a one - dimensional @xmath126 atom , plotted against the strength @xmath137 of the @xmath126 potential .",
    "both @xmath31 and @xmath45 converge near the maximum , whereas the three - level model overestimates the correct hyperpolarizability by over @xmath162 also shown are the normalized partial sums @xmath163 when truncated to level n. the failure of the three - level model to accurately predict @xmath31 can be traced directly to the failure of @xmath164 to converge with three levels .",
    "the results show that the tla is active when @xmath31 nears the hamiltonian limit , but that it does not apply to the sum rules.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ] +      the three - level ansatz ( tla ) states that only three levels are required when @xmath31 is near its maximum value .",
    "the maximum to which this refers is the three - level model limit in figure [ fig : betalimitfig ] .",
    "the actual limit predicted by the full sum rules is also this limit , provided that the tla is actually valid .",
    "a corollary to the above definition of the tla is that only three levels are required when @xmath31 is near its local maximum value for a given system , even if the local maximum is far from the theoretical maximum .",
    "all hamiltonian systems studied to date , including the plethora of quantum graphs delineated in the prior section , satisfy the tla when their optimum geometries are discovered , even though many fall short of the hamiltonian limit .",
    "there is something fundamental about the way the tla works .",
    "the tla has yet to be proven .",
    "it may be exact , in which case the first three terms in the sum over states for @xmath31 in eqn [ betaijk ] converge to the exact maximum , and the rest sum to zero , or it may be approximate , _ nearly _ converging to the limit but with some residual value from the remaining sum over states , all while the sum rules hold exactly . a system with the maximum @xmath31 in the three - level model has @xmath165 and @xmath96 , and is a system with wide level spacing between the first and second excited states . but as we have seen , hamiltonian systems often have @xmath166 , but also satisfy the tla .",
    "the tla was required to rescue the tfl from the plague of infinities in the many - state catastrophe@xcite .",
    "but where does it come from ?",
    "more to the point , which energy levels @xmath167 and transition moments @xmath168 cause @xmath169 to converge to a small or zero value when this same set of spectra and moments satisfy the sum rules ? this is a multi - dimensional minimization problem with an infinite set of constraint equations , the sum rules .",
    "in fact , we can write @xmath170,\\ ] ] with the definition @xmath171 and attempt to minimize @xmath172 subject to the sum rules in eqn [ trksumrule ] to derive a set of equations for the spectra and moments . assuming the spectra actually follow a specific scaling law would generate a set of equations for the moments , but even if this is solvable , what hamiltonian corresponds to these moments ?",
    "more challenging is the fact that the three most important states depend on the specific configuration of the molecule , and can change as this configuration is varied .",
    "this could render the process intractable .",
    "but the tla is fundamental to the tfl so it must be proved .",
    "shafei and kuzyk speculate that it is true but not provable@xcite , much like the godel theorem for axiomatic arithmatic systems .",
    "perhaps a solution will emerge in the coming years , but in the meantime , the tla has not failed even once and is assumed by most researchers to be a universal principle .",
    "the monte carlo simulations described in section [ sec : results ] showed that the ideal spectrum for the states of a structure contributing the most to the nonlinearities scale quadratically or faster with mode number .",
    "molecules do nt scale this way , in general , but conjugated chains can exhibit this behavior .",
    "even so , the ideal spectrum is necessary but not sufficient to generate a large response .",
    "the eigenfunctions should generate large changes in dipole moment under excitation by a real or virtual photon , and at the same time , maintain large mode overlap .",
    "this ensures that the numerators in the terms of the three - level expansion eqn [ beta3l ] are large . a recent letter developed a new design paradigm , _ phase disruption _ , for generating the optimum transition moments@xcite .",
    "the method was developed for n electron quantum graph systems , models of quasi - one dimensional structures such as networks of nanowires .",
    "the ground state wavefunction along the main chain has a kink created by the presence of a short side chain or group , which diverts some electron flux from the main change and creates a disruption in the phase along the chain .",
    "this , in turn creates a preferential charge distribution to one side of the prong .",
    "the side group causes a large change in dipole moment upon excitation of an electron from the ground state , and for specific lengths of the chain , the mode overlap remains large .",
    "since the hyperpolarizability depends on the product of the change in dipole moment and mode overlap , phase disruption may lead to large enhancements in the nonlinear optical response .",
    "modulated conjugation@xcite systems were the first to leap the apparent limit shown in figure [ fig : betalimitfig ] , but their nonlinearities remained well below the limit .",
    "a cursory view of the work reveals that the eigenfunctions take on the general characteristics required for optimum transition moments , viz . , shifting charge localization from the ground to first excited state ( producing a large change in dipole moment ) while maintaining some mode overlap and this enabling @xmath31 to increase .",
    "if the spectra can be optimized , then this design method may lead to better molecules , as well .    to date ,",
    "nearly all hamiltonian and monte carlo studies of the tfl have been one - dimensional models .",
    "phase disruption and modulated conjugation are two promising methods for enhancing nonlinearities , but they may fail miserably in real molecules , simply because the spatial mode overlap required to enhance transition moments may be small",
    ".      the fundamental limit of a molecule is now established , and with it , limits on real materials may be computed by assembling aggregations , aligning if necessary to eliminate centrosymmetry , and computing local field factors .",
    "but for devices , the relevant parameters are the macroscopic refractive index change with a low - frequency field ( second - order electro - optic or magneto - optic effect ) , or with an intense light beam ( third order ) .",
    "the former has applications to electro - optic modulators , phase conjugators using diffracting gratings in spatial light modulators , beam steering , and filtering@xcite .",
    "the latter has applications to light by light control for switching@xcite , frequency mixing@xcite , and harmonic generation@xcite .",
    "the figure of merit ( fom ) of a device is in general a product or ratio of physically relevant parameters , such as the switching voltage or intensity , and the optical absorption .",
    "these , in turn , are functions of the dispersive second- and third - order susceptibilities , calculated from the first and second hyperpolarizabilities .",
    "a contributed paper in this volume shows how to compute the fom for an electro - optic device .",
    "similar computations for all - optical devices are clearly relevant and rather complex , and may be of interest to graduate students and researchers .",
    "this is fertile ground for exploring materials science for device physics .",
    "we end this section with a concise list of known and unknown features of the tfl :    1 .   truncating the sum over states _ and _ sum rules to three levels produces the three - level model @xmath173 , where @xmath77 is given in eqn [ betamax ] .",
    "2 .   the three - level model violates the sum rules .",
    "in particular , @xmath174 is explicitly violated .",
    "therefore , the moments computed using the truncated sum rules and substituted into the three - level sum over states to produce the three - level model are in error , no matter what system for which we specify an @xmath49 and energy level differences @xmath83 and @xmath88 .",
    "if we truncate the sum over states to three levels but not the sum rules , we are simply stopping the sum over states after three levels using the moments and spectra we have in hand from some theory ( e.g. , a solved hamiltonian ) , and we ll find that this truncated sum , called @xmath45 , is less than @xmath77 .",
    "we can not prove this .",
    "but we believe it is true .",
    "4 .   the full sum over states for @xmath31 approaches",
    "@xmath45 when @xmath31 is nearing its maximum .",
    "_ this is the statement of the three - level ansatz_. 5 .   solving a hamiltonian for the spectra and states ( and calculating the moments ) produces a number for @xmath31 and satisfies the sum rules . but picking spectra and moments that satisfy the sum rules does not mean there is a hamiltonian that could have generated them .",
    "if one truncates sum rules and the sum over states to n levels , then it is possible that @xmath77 computed this way will diverge as n goes to infinity .",
    "but the states and spectra that cause this to happen violate the tla .",
    "so the tla in effect rescues the three - level model .",
    "7 .   finally , we know that to date , all hamiltonian systems have @xmath175 .",
    "we also know that the monte carlo calculations generated some solutions with @xmath176 , but we do nt know that the spectra and moments that cause @xmath31 to get into this range are physical .    it would be equally informative to list what we do nt know about the tfl today :    1 .",
    "we ca nt explain the limit gap .",
    "the monte carlo calculations reviewed in this paper used exact sum rules to constrain otherwise random sets @xmath177 of spectra and moments . constrained by the tla",
    ", these models hit the three - level model limit in table [ tab : modellimits ] .",
    "perhaps the cardinality of all the real number pairs selected this way is larger than that of all pairs that could be generated by a physical hamiltonian , which appear to be bounded by the hamiltonian limits .",
    "spectral theory of hamiltonian operators , often studied in quantum chaos , is probably required to make any inroads into understanding the limit gap .",
    "this remains to be investigated .",
    "we have no idea why the numerical value of the hamiltonian limit is what it is . what is special about @xmath160 ?",
    "3 .   we ca nt yet specify a design ( potential , symmetry , dimensionality ) that will hit the limits .",
    "we have yet to study potential optimization models of three - dimensional , interacting multi - electron systems that actually resemble a molecule .",
    "we do nt know which limits apply to interacting multielectron , multidimensional systems , as the three - level model limit is an approximation whose value as an upper bound to an actual limit for such systems remains unproven .",
    "we havent proved the three - level ansatz .",
    "the tfl was invented nearly sixteen years ago and has led to discoveries of better molecules , numerous analytical tests , and a deep understanding of the origins of nonlinear optical effects in molecular - scale structures .",
    "the field should continue to spawn significant new studies and many thesis topics .",
    "the invention of the erbium - doped fiber amplifier , the advent of high speed modulation of laser light , and the realization of dense wavelength division multiplexers led to the construction of an optical network hardware layer capable of supporting the explosion of the internet and the world - wide web in the mid 1990s , providing the bandwidth to support tcp / ip on a global scale .",
    "google , facebook , and other search and social media enterprises now dominate the business landscape and have displaced ibm and at&t as the darlings of the stock market .",
    "though computing itself is still dominated by electronic devices , terrestrial and sub - oceanic communication is optical .",
    "we all depend upon the ubiquity of optical devices in our professional and personal lives .",
    "it is exciting for a scientist to think that a few advances in optical materials science could have such a large impact on human life .",
    "nonlinear optics has yet to achieve this ubiquity , but may do so once more responsive materials are created .",
    "the theory of fundamental limits ( tfl ) has revealed that present molecular designs may be much improved to enhance their optical nonlinearities .",
    "explorations described in the previous section suggest that the energy spectra must be optimized to scale quadratically or faster with mode number , at least for the low lying levels that contribute the most to @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "topological and geometrical optimizations of spectrally acceptable systems can then lead to greater enhancements , but if the spectra do nt scale well , then neither will the nonlinearities , no matter how their symmetries and shapes are adjusted .",
    "this review has identified a number of fundamentally important and interesting theoretical problems that students and researchers can address in the coming years : ( 1 ) discover the fundamental principles behind the three - level ansatz and offer a proof , ( 2 ) solve a model with an exotic hamiltonian and optimize the hyperpolarizabilities in an attempt to bridge the limit gap , ( 3 ) solve a 2d and 3d model and optimize the hyperpolarizabilities to discover the effect of dimensionality , and ( 4 ) compute the fundamental limits of figures of merit of optical devices to seek new operating conditions that maximize performance by trading off response and loss . as an interested party , i wish ambitious students the best and expect them to drive the field forward with new discoveries and surprises .",
