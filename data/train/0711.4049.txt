    "chromatic dispersion of optical fibers is one of the major factors limiting capacity of fiber communication systems .",
    "it results in broadening of optical pulses due to difference in velocities of different spectral components .",
    "the dispersion management technique  @xcite was proposed as a method to solve the problem of dispersive pulse broadening .",
    "an optical fiber link with dispersion management is composed of periodically arranged fiber spans with alternating signs of dispersion .",
    "the fiber spans are chosen to make the cumulative effect of dispersion small or even zero .",
    "full compensation of the dispersive effects is achieved by making the mean value of the dispersion to be zero . in this case",
    "as a pulse propagates over one period it will be spread and then contracted to its original shape .",
    "increasing bit - rates inevitably leads to manifestation of nonlinear properties of optical fiber .",
    "as bit rates increase , the temporal width of an optical pulse ( bit carrier ) @xmath0 decreases . on the other hand",
    "the energy of the pulse must remain above some critical level @xmath1 to provide minimal detection bit - error at the end of the line , and therefore the power of the signal ( @xmath2 ) increases as the pulse narrows @xmath3 .",
    "it is a well known , experimentally verified fact that the index of refraction of the fiber core grows linearly with the power of the signal , @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is linear index of refraction and @xmath6 is a coefficient of kerr nonlinearity ) . with the high enough power the nonlinear response of",
    "the medium becomes important .",
    "since dispersion management is a purely linear approach to compensate pulse broadening , validity of this approach becomes less obvious in the presence of nonlinearity .",
    "it was shown that in presence of nonlinearity the compensation is still possible for a special class of pulses known as the dispersion managed ( dm ) solitons  .",
    "detailed information about the dm solitons and their applications can be found in  @xcite .",
    "soon after the concept of dm solitons was introduced it became clear that both analytic representation and accurate numerical description of the dm soliton shape are challenging problems .",
    "the first problem was addressed in many papers , where approximations of the central part of the dm soliton and asymptotic of oscillatory tails was considered ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however the general solution of the this problem remains unsolved .",
    "the problem of an accurate numerical description of the dm soliton shape is also stimulated considerable effort , which was solved by in  @xcite using slow dynamics model of dm solitons proposed in  @xcite .",
    "later this approach used to address behavior of dm solitons for the systems with both dispersion and nonlinearity compensation  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion compensation while resolving the physical problem with the pulse broadening , poses an obstacle for the numerical computation of such solutions . following the standard approach",
    "the description of soliton consists of launching a signal and waiting for all the continuous radiation to escape .",
    "for the problem with dispersion management this process is extremely slow and ineffective on the tails of the soliton .",
    "authors of  @xcite proposed solving of the averaged equation for the analysis of solutions , which for the solitary waves reduces from an integro - differential equation to a nonlinear integral equation , solvable by a nonlinear iterative procedure .",
    "this allowed for a fast way of achieving precision exceeding any necessary requirements for the practical applications .    unlike the conventional nls soliton ,",
    "the dispersion managed system supports propagation of bound pairs of solutions , or bisolitons . existence of bisoliton solutions was shown in the numerical investigations of  @xcite and later confirmed experimentally in  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this experimental work considered antisymmetric bisolitons and therefore we limit our investigation to that type of bisolitons .",
    "these solutions are interesting for the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations , and represent a new phenomena in nonlinear fiber optics .",
    "they illustrate a new type of solutions of nonlinear equation where dispersion coefficient is replaced with a periodic function .",
    "the potential applications for the optical communication systems were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "bisolitons can be used to introduce a three - letter alphabet ( `` empty slot '' , `` dm soliton '' and `` bisoliton '' ) , replacing a conventional binary alphabet .",
    "this could increase a system capacity without a change to the physical parameters of the system .",
    "the shape as well as other important characteristics of bisolitons were found in  @xcite using a modification of the numerical method proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the equation describing averaged dynamics of the solution is reduced to have a single universal parameter , which incorporates all of the physical and geometrical characteristics of the optical system  @xcite .",
    "analysis of this equation showed the existence of two branches of bisolitons determined by the universal parameter , with a critical bifurcation point connecting the two branches .",
    "investigation of dm bisolitons was based on the iteration of nonlinear map .",
    "the analysis of the newly discovered branch of solutions was complicated by the lack of convergence of the iterative procedure .",
    "careful analysis of the map showed the existence of eigenvalues outside of the unit circle , explaining the existence of the growing modes of the map .",
    "in this work we propose to utilize the method of polynomial spectral transformations to construct a contractive map , preserving the original fixed points .",
    "the application of this method allowed for the discovery of the previously unknown branch of bisoliton solutions .",
    "these bisolitons present new solutions to nonlinear equation with periodic dispersion .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite indicates a new experimental evidence of existence of this branch of bisoliton solutions .",
    "the new found bisoliton solutions would allow to introduce a 4-letter alphabet , further increasing the capacity of existing lines .",
    "a well established model for propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a nonlinear , dispersive medium is the nonlinear equation @xmath7 where the scalar function @xmath8 is the envelope of the signal , @xmath9 is the distance along the fiber , @xmath10 is retarded time . without loss of generality",
    "we consider a fiber link with constant nonlinearity given by @xmath11 .",
    "function @xmath12 is the dispersion as a function of distance along the fiber . for a dispersion managed system",
    "this is a piecewise constant , periodic function which can be written in the form @xmath13 if @xmath14 , and @xmath15 if @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a dispersion map period , and @xmath18 .",
    "a fiber link with dispersion management has a characteristic time scale @xmath19 .",
    "the physical meaning of this time is the width of a pulse such that the pulse will approximately double in width as it propagates over half of the period .",
    "the characteristic `` residual dispersion length '' @xmath20 is the distance when a pulse with width @xmath21 propagating over a fiber with dispersion @xmath22 will approximately double in width . rescaling the variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 results in the equation @xmath25 @xmath26 is characteristic `` nonlinear length '' on which the change of the phase of the pulse due to fiber nonlinearity will be of the order @xmath27 .    to take advantage of dispersion management in the presence of nonlinearity",
    ", the compensation must take place on the distances where nonlinearity effects are small and negligible compared to the local value of dispersion",
    ". therefore the dispersion management works in the linear regime , and two well separated scales of pulse propagation can be distinguished . on the first scale local dispersion will dominate over the weak effects the residual dispersion and the nonlinearity .",
    "there the pulse is rapidly broadened and brought back to its original width as a result of the alternating signs of local dispersion .",
    "the second scale is where the effects of nonlinearity and residual dispersion accumulate and become important .",
    "thus , the spectrum of the signal can be considered in the form @xmath28 = q(\\omega , z)\\exp \\left ( -{\\rm i}\\omega^2      /(l/2 )      \\int_{l/4}^{z } \\mbox{d}\\xi \\ , \\frac{d(\\xi ) - d_0}{d_1 } \\right ) ,    \\label{envelope_phase}\\ ] ] with the fourier transform @xmath29 defined as @xmath30 = \\int \\mbox{d}t \\ , \\exp({\\mbox i } \\omega t ) f(t)$ ] . here",
    "the exponent is the rapidly changing phase due to the large value of local dispersion and the amplitude @xmath31 is varying slowly with @xmath9 due to residual dispersion and the nonlinear effects .",
    "substituting this form of @xmath32 into the equation  ( [ dless ] ) and taking an average over a map period we obtain gabitov - turitsyn equation describing evolution of @xmath31 @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is dirac s delta function .",
    "we are interested in computation of antisymmetric bisolitons which are solitary wave solutions of this equation .",
    "for such a solution the amplitude profile is independent of the distance along the fiber , and can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a wave number of the solitary wave .",
    "with @xmath38 the function @xmath39 is governed by the following equation @xmath40 thus far we have reduced this three parameter partial differential equation to an integral equation with a single free parameter ( an alternative way to do that is presented in appendix  a ) .",
    "in this paper we study the family of antisymmetric bisolitons at different positive values of parameter @xmath41 . in order to solve equation  ( [ int_eq ] ) we use the following iterative procedure @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a petviashvilli factor  @xcite which is introduced to avoid the convergence to the trivial solution @xmath44 by making that solution unstable .",
    "the operator @xmath45 is a projection onto odd functions , used here to project the iterated functions onto the space of antisymmetric functions .",
    "we solve the equation  ( [ scheme ] ) numerically , discretizing @xmath39 on a grid of @xmath46 points .",
    "the iterations are stopped when @xmath47 satisfies the condition @xmath48 a fourier transform of a sum of two gaussian pulses , shifted apart and taken with opposite signs is used as a seed for the iteration procedure with @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is decreased incrementally , with a previous solution used as a seed for the next value of @xmath41 , until the parameter reaches zero .",
    "the same procedure was performed in the increasing direction from @xmath50 .",

    "direct application of the scheme in equation  ( [ scheme ] ) demonstrates convergence only for the lower branch of solutions , and does not allow to find the upper branch of solutions . in order to find the solutions from the upper branch we study the spectrum of the @xmath53 and modify the map .",
