    "the aei is a spiral instability , similar to galatic spirals but driven by magnetic stress rather than self - gravity .",
    "it occurs in the inner region of an accretion disk threaded by a vertical magnetic field of the order of equipartition with the gas pressure .",
    "the spiral extracts energy and angular momentum from the disk , causing accretion , and stores them in a rossby vortex at its corotation radius ( see also the contributions of tagger and caunt , these proceedings ) .",
    "this vortex then leaks energy and angular momentum as alfvn waves to the corona , where it can power a wind or a jet . for more details",

    "we have studied , using a pseudo - newtonian potential , the properties of the instability when the disk inner radius @xmath1 approaches the last stable orbit at @xmath2 .",
