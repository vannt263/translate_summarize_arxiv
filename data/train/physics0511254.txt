    "it is my great pleasure to join italian colleagues for this ambitious workshop on communicating physics . in my main career as a theoretical physicist",
    ", my research has addressed many topics in particle physics .",
    "my close engagement with experiment has made the fermi national accelerator laboratory a stimulating scientific home for many years . beyond my personal activities to bring the ideas and aspirations of particle physics to a broad audience , i have held a number of positions in which i have been able to encourage  and take pleasure in  the outreach and education efforts of many of my colleagues .",
    "i have served as head of the fermilab theory group , as deputy director of the superconducting super collider central design group , and as chair of the american physical society s division of particles and fields . in the last capacity ,",
    "i oversaw the planning and execution of _ snowmass 2001 : _ a summer study on the future of particle physics ( see http://snowmass2001.org[snowmass2001.org ] ) .",
    "i am also a member of the board of trustees of the illinois mathematics and science academy , a state - supported residential high school .",

    "department of energy national laboratory for particle physics , operated by a consortium of 90 research universities in the united states , canada , italy , and japan .",
    "the laboratory and its research community are highly international ; our lab has much in common with cern .",
    "fermilab has some two thousand employees , an annual budget of $ 300 m , and welcomes 2250 experimental `` users '' from around the world .",
    "our principal research instrument is the tevatron , a superconducting proton synchrotron @xmath0 kilometers in circumference that accelerates protons and antiprotons to nearly 1  tev . when operated as a proton - antiproton collider",

    "many of you have visited my country , or gained an impression of it from puccini s opera , _ la fanciulla del west , _ or from the cult classic film , _ the blues brothers . _ nevertheless , a few remarks about the country s character may provide useful context for today s exploration .",
    "the united states is large in both land area and population , and much of its area is lightly settled .",
    "it is a young nation , at least in its psyche , and it is the wealthiest country in the history of the planet . the u.s .",
    "was founded as a nation of immigrants , and the flux of people from diverse origins to our shores continues today",
    ". a great degree of social mobility is perhaps correlated with a restrained esteem for authorities ( including professors ) . at the same time , unease with the pace of change leads many to a powerful reliance on authority .    the u.s .",
    "is a deeply non - napoleonic society , characterized by much local autonomy , notably in the responsibility for schools .",
    "our university system is highly heterogeneous .",
    "the national government assumes responsibility only for a few military academies , and our most celebrated universities are largely private institutions . in america",
    "s heartland , the state universities serve as the leading cultural institutions . though academic science is quite young in america , research has traditionally been centered in universities  research and teaching go hand in hand  and that has led to a superb standard of postgraduate education .",
    "in contrast to the european standard , we do not have dominant national newspapers .",
    "our vast radio and television empires , which seem increasingly preoccupied with gossip and celebrity trials , evince little interest in science .",
    "national public radio , especially in its local programming , is receptive to science and culture .",
    "all of these factors  beginning with the vastness of the country  enhance the importance of local outreach and education efforts .",
    "some of the motivations i would cite for physics communication are similar to those evoked by earlier speakers . first comes the teaching imperative : the desire not only to pass on information about the minute particulars of current research , but also to cultivate an understanding of the scientific worldview , with its rejection of authority , reliance on experiment , and celebration of doubt .",
    "next comes the propaganda function , which i understand here in a positive light : _ propaganda fide _ for our attachment to reason , observation , and controlled experiment ; the development of what social scientists call `` diffuse good will '' toward the scientific enterprise ; and an attempt to influence behavior and gain acceptance and support for our undertakings .",
    "since we scientists devote our lives to exploration , i see outreach and education as a mode of exploring the world  an opportunity to learn from and about others .",
    "some of my colleagues emphasize the value of `` inreach''to see ourselves as others see us !",
    "previous speakers have spoken of engaged learning ; we might well aspire to _ engaged teaching . _",
    "participation in outreach programs can open our own students to the wider world .",
    "our communications efforts can also help to change the face of physics  to attract women in greater numbers and to show minority and new immigrant groups the appeal of careers in and around science .",
    "finally , outreach and education programs are good for physicists : the joy that comes from sharing our numinous adventure with others is marvelous psychotherapy !",
    "the american physical society ( http://www.aps.org[www.aps.org ] ) , the principal professional organization for academic and industrial physicists in the united states , offers many education and outreach programs ( http://www.aps.org/educ/[www.aps.org/educ/ ] ) .",

    "when leon lederman became director of fermilab in 1979 , he created the saturday morning physics program ( http://www-ppd.fnal.gov/smp-w/[www-ppd.fnal.gov/smp-w/ ] ) for high school students curious about science . for more than twenty - five years",
    ", we have welcomed students  and some of their teachers  to the lab on saturday mornings for ten - week series of lectures ( two hours ) and in - depth tours of many activities at the laboratory .",
    "the lab runs three sessions of smp each year , with as many as 120 students in each `` class . ''",
    "by now , more than six thousand students have been exposed to the ideas of particle physics , the wonders of exotic technologies , and the spirit of scientific inquiry .",
    "we made an important discovery during the first year of saturday morning physics : a number of high school science teachers accompanied their students , and devoted ten consecutive saturday mornings to learning about particle physics . though they did nt all",
    "have deep preparation to teach physics , they all had sharp intelligence , inquisitive minds , and high enthusiasm .",
    "they all wanted to become better teachers ; our lab could provide information and encouragement and  perhaps most important  the opportunity for them to meet and support each other .",
    "i believe that our accidental discovery of these teachers launched the initiative that blossomed , under the inspired guidance of marge bardeen and stanka jovanovic , into the lab s education office ( http://www-ed.fnal.gov[www-ed.fnal.gov ] ) and leon m.  lederman science education center .",

    "width=377 ]    available as wall chart , poster , and place mat , this representation of our `` standard model '' has had a global reach , with more than @xmath3 distributed .",
    "it has helped move particle physics into the classroom , and it presents many essential notions of our current understanding .",
    "the wall chart project also stimulated _ the particle adventure , _ an interactive web site .",
    "_ quarknet _ is a remarkable immersive research experience for high school teachers and their students that is based on lively ongoing partnerships with experimental research groups .",
    "currently fifty - three _ quarknet _ centers operate in twenty - five states and puerto rico .",
    "they touch @xmath2 students per year , and five hundred teachers and one hundred students are research partners with 150 physicist mentors .",
    "one of the goals is to engage teachers and students in real time with data from the large hadron collider at cern . for now , quarknet centers involve twelve major experiments and the computing grid .",
    "a key tenet of the _ quarknet _ paradigm is that the teachers and students should gain experience in assembling and commissioning real detectors .",
    "a favorite example is the construction of cosmic - ray detectors that consist of several paddles of plastic scintillator , photomultiplier tubes , and the associated trigger system .",
    "school groups are deploying these simple detectors at schools around the country in the _ quarknet _ cosmic - ray detector array .",
    "students are learning to use the grid to handle calculations involving large amounts of data .",
    "( i have the impression that the professionals are learning how to make the grid a robust tool , in the process . )      in the summer of 1999 , computer scientist chuck severance and physicist steve goldfarb , then a member of the l3 collaboration at cern s large electron - positron collider , tested a web lecture archive of lectures for summer students .",
    "i had the good fortune to be their first experimental animal .",
    "severance s sync ",
    "matic software framework@xcite is simple and functional .",
    "it synchronizes a video stream with good - resolution images of the speaker s slides , all displayed in a web browser . a recent example from fermilab s web lecture archive",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : fish3 ] .",
    "when i showed the system to my friends in fermilab s visual media services , they were impressed with the low resource cost ( including modest bandwidth and storage requirements ) and ease of use , and were quick to see the potential in a streaming video archive . today",
    "at fermilab , the streaming video archive boasts 1334 entries , including colloquia , conference talks , academic training lectures , and memorable events .",
    "we hoped that the archive might prove valuable for fermilab s staff and users , as indeed it has , but did nt imagine that it would become part of the lab s public face  and the field s .",
    "in fact , many viewers from outside our community land at the video archive thanks to search engines , not by drilling down from the fermilab home page .      while living at fermilab as a cdf postdoc , aaron dominguez ( now at the university of nebraska ) developed an educational project in aurora , illinois , to improve the future and stability of the hispanic community by supporting the educational and social accomplishments of its young people .",
    "bilingual english / spanish tutors ( best ) pairs high - achieving high school student mentors with low - income elementary school children .",
    "the best tutors help their younger peers with homework , reading , and math after school twice a week .",
    "the tutors also gain a critical sense of responsibility for the successful education of their own latino community .",
    "aaron s program has enrolled over 60 students and 35 bilingual high school mentors ; the best model has been replicated in the neighboring community of batavia .      in 1997 ,",
    "i received an invitation to give the first carl sagan memorial lecture in the series , _ cosmos revisited , _ at the smithsonian institution in washington .",
    "i wanted to give members of the audience specimens that would stimulate them to continue the conversation begun by my lecture , `` the particle cosmos . ''",
    "with judy jackson , we conceived an edition of eight postcards depicting significant events  the outcome of proton - antiproton collisions  from the cdf and d  experiments .",
    "+     we began by asking the experimental groups to submit authentic event displays .",
    "an example is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : fish2 ] .",
    "this display of a top - quark event from the d  experiment illustrates an important reality : experimenters are deeply attached to their detectors , so the fixed detector elements are represented by strong , assertive lines , whereas the ephemeral tracks that bear witness to noteworthy one - time occurrences are indistinct .",
    "the light green traces ( one solid , one dotted ) representing muons  crucial markers in the top - antitop event  are nearly invisible .",
    "graphic designer bruce kerr ( http://www.kerrcom.com[www.kerrcom.com ] ) preserved the authenticity of the event displays by discreetly editing the event display to emphasize the elements that signal top - pair production . except for the background sunburst that contributes visual interest and serves as a metaphor for the conversion of energy into new forms of matter ,",
    "every element of the postcard shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fish2 ] is present in the original postscript file . and",
    "every element in the original event display is preserved in the final image .",
    "such fidelity is important ; the image is instantly readable to physicists , including its creators in d , and intelligible  with just a bit of explanation  to laypersons .",
    "we wrote captions that would explain and initiate conversation .",
    "the postcard images ( http://lutece.fnal.gov/postcards[lutece.fnal.gov/postcards ] ) have become true icons of particle physics , with an impact far beyond their original purpose .",
    "the division of particles and fields and the division of physics of beams of the american physical society organized a three - week summer study on the future of particle physics in snowmass , colorado , in july 2001 .",
    "more than 1200 physicists participated  many young , many from outside the united states  in a very broad examination of where our field should be heading .",
    "early on , we decided to make outreach and education an essential part of the snowmass 2001 experience .",
    "we wanted to share our love for science with the interesting mix of people in aspen and snowmass , and to encourage our colleagues to see each other in action .",
    "we also believed that the public interaction would reinforce the optimism and enthusiasm that participants brought to snowmass .",
    "theoretical physicist elizabeth simmons , who chaired the outreach and education effort , has described the extraordinary results in _",
    "_ physics today.__@xcite the snowmass 2001 program ( http://snowmass2001.org/outreach/education2.html[snowmass2001.org/outreach/education2.html ] ) included workshops for teachers and students , public lectures , a science book fair , science theater , open - air talks , astronomy activities , conversations with children , outreach workshops , and a balloon ascension to recreate victor hess s discovery of cosmic rays .",
    "the centerpiece was a huge weekend science fair on the snowmass village mall that attracted some 1500 members of the general public . among the weekend",

    "in connection with the summer study , the dpf commissioned an illustrated thematic survey of our vision of particle physics and its future in the most ambitious intellectual terms . within this broad vision ,",
    "the document was to identify the questions we want to address over the next two decades . like the summer study itself , the thematic survey aimed to help our community recognize and articulate what particle physics is and aspires to be , guided by the scientific imperatives .",
    "_ quarks unbound _ was a smashing success , for three principal reasons .",
    "first , we were careful to think through what we wanted to accomplish and to identify the audiences we wanted to reach .",
    "second , we entrusted the project to a small team  not a large and representative committee  that included a science writer , a graphic designer , and a few physicists .",
    "[ we did not want the sort of bland `` offends no one , delights no one '' product that large committees are adept at producing ! ] third , we distributed _ quarks unbound _ widely and enthusiastically to groups and individuals .",
    "a private donor financed a second printing , so that the number of copies distributed worldwide now exceeds @xmath4 .",
    "i am continually impressed by the passion , curiosity , and faith in the value of exploration evidenced by those who attend our outreach and education programs .",
    "it may be true , as several speakers have opined , that the general population is ignorant and indifferent about science , but my experience is that we do find a receptive and engaged audience .",
    "accordingly , the first lesson is : respect ( do not underestimate ) the audience .",
    "leadership from established scientists and heroes of the field provides important validation for the efforts of others .",
    "the effectiveness of leading by example is well - established .",
    "respected senior physicists can also discourage the misperception that engaging with the public is unworthy of serious scientists .",
    "they also have value as fundraisers , from both public and private sources .",
    "while leaders are important , it may be even more important for the leaders to let go : to grant autonomy and resources to small groups and trust them to do wonderful things .",
    "nothing is more stifling to creativity and innovation than repeated reviews by committees constructed to represent an average .",
    "the field is better served by original  even quirky  efforts that explore a whole range of approaches than by efforts programmed to hit the mean each time .",
    "both those in authority and those who execute should find pleasure in experimenting and taking risks !",
    "a familiar conceit is that `` physicists can do anything . ''",
    "i like to tell my colleagues that the complete slogan concludes ``  badly , '' to remind them of the rewards of collaborating with professionals who know their fields as well as we physicists know physics . working with gifted writers , editors , designers , artists , and educators can be immensely satisfying and can lead you to do things you did nt know were possible .",
    "let me underline again the importance of local activities .",
    "these include organizing public lectures and symposia at the universities and labs , engaging with cultural institutions and creative people within the community , and developing relationships with local radio stations and newspapers .",
    "a record of success on the local scene may even enable effective national efforts .",
    "one committed person can do a lot  and an individual can achieve even more with encouragement and support from colleagues .",
    "but it is also delightful to learn from others and to draw inspiration from their efforts .",
    "the _ quarknet _ model has succeeded so well because it has elements of individuality , collaboration , coordination , and the bond that grows from being part of a large and ambitious enterprise",
    ".    always ask , why are we doing this ? who is the audience ?",
    "what are our goals ?",
    "what will success mean ?",
    "be prepared to finish the task : if you prepare a new brochure about your experiment or your subject and are passive or hesitant about distributing it , you have limited your effectiveness .",
    "if following through seems like too much effort , you should notice that before you start .",
    "expect to discover new people ( not all phd physicists ) .",
    "your role may be catalytic .",
    "leaders succeed when others become the stars .",
    "expect also to discover new ideas , and remember that a new outreach triumph may occur when you least expect it .",
    "experiments at the large hadron collider break new ground in scale and internationalism , counting collaborators in the thousands .",
    "the outreach efforts of the atlas ( 34 countries ) and cms ( 31 countries ) collaborations are truly transnational , and marvelously dynamic .",
    "the atlas experiment movie ( http://atlasexperiment.org/movie/[atlasexperiment.org/movie/ ] ) , for example , is available in ten languages and has won awards in five countries .",
    "the impressive reach of atlas and cms , depicted by the colored spaces in figure  [ fig : cms ] , is a source of immense satisfaction and pleasure to     +     particle physicists . for me , and for many of my colleagues , the opportunity to meet and join in common cause with people from many nations is one of the great joys of our research .",
    "but there are many blank spots on the lhc maps of the world , and we should take those open spaces as a challenge .",
    "i believe that we should aspire to engage the whole world in the values and the rewards of science",
    ". our goal should truly be physics without boundaries .",
    "science is more than solving the next great puzzle of particle physics ; it is a set of values for contemplating the world .",
