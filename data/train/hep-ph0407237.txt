    "the @xmath1 photoproduction cross section is dominated by the production of the @xmath2 meson . in the @xmath3-wave",
    "the near threshold @xmath1 production is strongly influenced by the isoscalar @xmath5 and the isovector @xmath6 resonances .",
    "the analysis of the near - threshold @xmath1 dynamics is especially important for an explanation of the nature of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "it is still a matter of controversy whether this meson is genuine quasi bound @xmath7 state .",
    "exploiting the large coupling of the photon to the vector mesons along with the @xmath3-@xmath4 wave interference one is able to reveal many interesting properties of the scalar mesons , for instance their photoproduction cross section and their impact on the angular distribution of the produced kaons .",
    "the data on the near threshold @xmath1 photoproduction are , however , very scarce .",
    "our analysis is based on the results obtained by behrend et al . at desy @xcite at the average incident photon energy of 5.65 gev and by barber et al . at daresbury @xcite at 4 gev .",
    "the main motivation of our study was to explain a huge discrepancy in the @xmath3-wave cross sections reported by these experiments .",
    "the results varied between 2.7 and 96 nb respectively . we have also performed a more extensive analysis of the moments of the angular distributions .",
    "these moments are the main source of information about the partial wave interference . to this end",
    "we have taken into account all the moments constructed from the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave amplitudes .",
    "it is worth of mentioning that previous analyses excluded all the moments but @xmath8 .",
    "here we present the main ingredients of our model referring the reader to our previous papers @xcite for a more thorough study . the partial wave projected amplitudes have been constructed for the reaction @xmath0 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are helicities of the photon , incoming and outgoing protons , @xmath11 is the @xmath12 solid angle , @xmath13 is 4-momentum transfer squared , @xmath14 is the @xmath1 effective mass and @xmath15 describe the angular momentum of the outgoing @xmath1 system and its projection .    for the @xmath3-wave we have used the born amplitudes schematically depicted in fig .",
    "altogether we have 6 diagrams of the type presented in fig.1a and 5 diagrams of the type presented in fig .",
    "the model has also taken into account the final state interactions .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 transitions have been included along with the @xmath1 elastic rescattering . to describe the propagation of the exchanged particles we have used either the normal @xmath18 or the regge propagators @xmath19\\gamma(1-\\alpha(t))(\\alpha's)^{\\alpha(t)}/(2s^{\\alpha_0}),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the mass of the exchanged particle and",
    "@xmath21 is its regge trajectory .",
    "+ in the @xmath4-wave we have assumed the reaction to proceed through the pomeron exchange .",
    "having performed the numerical calculations we have arrived at a very good description of the mass distributions and the moments which are shown in fig . 2 for the case of @xmath22=4 gev .",
    "= 4 gev ]    our model gives the value of the integrated photoproduction cross section in the range between 4 and 7 nb for the photon energy varying from 4 gev to 5.65 gev .",
    "using the model constructed by us we have properly reproduced the mass distributions and the moments measured in the experiments . some other observables like the differential cross section @xmath23 and the density matrix elements",
    "can also be described in agreement with experimental data .",
    "our calculation favors the desy experimental estimation of the s - wave integrated total cross section ."
