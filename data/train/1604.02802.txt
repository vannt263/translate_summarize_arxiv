    "with the tremendous growth of mobile subscribers and mobile connected devices , mobile broadband traffic has exhibited unprecedented growth . according to the forecast by cisco @xcite",
    ", there will be 11.5 billion mobile - connected devices by 2019 , which suggests that globally mobile data traffic is expected to grow to 24.3 exabytes ( eb ) per month by 2019  nearly a tenfold increase over that in 2014 .",
    "the ever increasing mobile data traffic propels us to seek new techniques to handle the challenge . deploying complementary small - cell networks like femtocells and picocells in the place where the need for traffic is",
    "`` hot '' emerges as a promising solution in the 5 g wireless networks @xcite . in urban areas ,",
    "radio propagation is more complicated than rural areas due to high - rise buildings , trees , etc . through reflection , diffraction , and even blockage ,",
    "buildings not only attenuate the received signal power but also weaken the undesired signal power , i.e. , the interference . consequently it often occurs that the strongest signal does not come from the geographically nearest bs which renders location - based cell association scheme @xcite ineffective .    in @xcite ,",
    "choi analyzed blockage effects of a millimeter - wave cellular system .",
    "different from traditional cellular signals , a mobile user ( mu ) can only communicate with bss with line - of - sight ( los ) connection in millimeter wave systems .",
    "therefore , outage probability obtained assuming millimeter wave communication will be higher than that expected in real cellular communications .",
    "@xcite analyzed the performance impact of large - scale blockage effects , which not only capture 2d shape of buildings , but also the height of buildings , in a microcell network . in their work",
    "a mu can only connect to its nearest los bs , which of course does not reflect the reality when a mu is in a central business district ( cbd ) with high - rise buildings or is located in an office building .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a model to analyze the coverage performance of heterogeneous networks incorporating both los and nlos connections , which is considered typical for urban environment .",
    "different from related work in which a bs is connected to the geographically nearest bs , which does not reflect the reality in urban environment , in our work , we consider that a mu is associated with a bs that delivers the strongest received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) where both los and nlos connections are considered in the analysis",
    ". the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the coverage performance in a heterogeneous network is analyzed considering both nlos and los transmissions and that a mu is associated with the bs that delivers the strongest sinr .",
    "2 .   an analytical expression for the coverage probability is derived .",
    "this is distinct from previous work where the theoretical analysis is conducted assuming that a mu is associated with its nearest los bs for analytical tractability .",
    "3 .   through results ,",
    "we find in urban areas , that deploying more bss in different tiers is better than merely deploying all bss in the same tier in terms of coverage probability .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] describes the system model . while in section",
    "[ sec3 ] , the per tier coverage probability and the coverage probability of the entire network are derived .",
    "results and performance analysis are given in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec5 ] concludes this paper .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-tier heterogeneous cellular network which consists of macrocells , picocells , femtocells , etc and focus on the analysis in downlink coverage performance .",
    "the bss of each tier are assumed to be spatially distributed on an infinite plane following independent homogeneous poisson point processes ( ppps ) denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 with intensities @xmath3 , @xmath2 .",
    "mus are located according to a homogeneous ppp denoted by @xmath4 with intensity @xmath5 .",
    "bss of the same tier transmit using the same power @xmath6 and share the same bandwidth @xmath7 .",
    "bss belonging to different tiers use different power and orthogonal bandwidth for transmission .",
    "therefore there is no inter - tier interference .",
    "furthermore , within a cell , mus use different frequency bandwidth for downlink and uplink transmission and therefore there is no intra - cell interference for downlink transmission analysis in our paper .",
    "however , bss of the same tier may interfere each other and generate the inter - cell interference which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "the assumption that both bss and mus are homogeneously distributed over space makes our analysis tractable with a minor loss of accuracy @xcite .      taking both nlos and los transmission into consideration",
    ", the nearest bs of a tier may not be the best candidate bs in that tier to associate with .",
    "more specifically , the cell association decision can be divided into the following two major steps .    1 .   if a mu requests to connect to a bs , it will firstly choose @xmath8 nearest bss from each tier to form the set of candidate bss .",
    "the candidate bs set is denoted by @xmath9\\right\\ } $ ] , where @xmath10 represents the @xmath11-th nearest bs in the @xmath12-th tier .",
    "for example , @xmath13 means the 3rd nearest bs in the 1st tier .",
    "the total number of candidate bss in @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "the mu will then choose which bs to associate with from @xmath14 based on its received sinr .",
    "the bs in @xmath16 that offers the highest received sinr to the mu will be chosen .    apparently ,",
    "when the value of @xmath8 is chosen to be sufficiently large , the coverage performance of the cell association scheme described above will resemble that of the cell association scheme that chooses the bs with the highest sinr at the mu from all tiers .",
    "we consider both nlos and los transmissions .",
    "the occurrence of nlos or los transmissions depend on various environmental factors , including geographical structure , distance and clusters .",
    "n. blaunstein @xcite gave the probability for nlos transmissions @xmath17 and the probability for los transmissions is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a parameter determined by the intensity and the mean length of the blockage lying in the visual path between a mu and a bs , and @xmath20 denotes the distance between the mu and the bs .",
    "bai @xcite extended n. blaunstein s work by using random shape theory which considers that @xmath19 is not only determined by the mean length but also the mean width .",
    "in general , nlos and los transmissions will experience different path losses , which is captured by the following model @xmath21=a_{n}^{\\left(k\\right)}+\\alpha_{n}^{\\left(k\\right)}10\\lg r+\\xi_{n}^{\\left(k\\right)},\\ ] ] @xmath22=a_{l}^{\\left(k\\right)}+\\alpha_{l}^{\\left(k\\right)}10\\lg r+\\xi_{l}^{\\left(k\\right)},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 means the los ( nlos ) transmission , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants determined by the transmission frequency , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respective path loss exponents , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are independent gaussian random variables with zero means , i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , reflecting the attenuation caused by flat fading .",
    "the corresponding parameters in this model can be found in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the received signal power without and with los transmission link in w ( watt ) are @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , where @xmath34 denotes the distance between a mu and the bs @xmath10 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants .",
    "therefore , the received power of the typical mu located at the origin @xmath38 from the bs @xmath10 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a random indicator variable equal to 1 for nlos transmission and 0 otherwise , and the corresponding probabilities are @xmath41 and @xmath42 given by ( [ eq : p_nlos ] ) and ( [ eq : p_los ] ) , respectively .",
    "we consider an interference - limited system and the impact of noise is thus ignored @xcite . for downlink transmission , the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) experienced by the typical mu associated with the bs @xmath43",
    "is expressed as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the palm point process @xcite representing the set of interferers in the @xmath12-th tier network .",
    "a mu is considered to be covered if the sir from any of the bs in the set of candidate bss , formed by choosing @xmath8 nearest bss from each tier , is greater than or equal to a prescribed threshold @xmath46 . in the following derivation",
    ", a conditional coverage probability will be firstly obtained with laplace transform and then the unconditional probability will be derived by integrating with respect to random variables .      for non - negative set @xmath47 , @xmath48 , if and only if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 , @xmath51 .    for non - negative set @xmath47 , @xmath48 ,",
