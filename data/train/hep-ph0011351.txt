    "the recent announcement of high statistics atmospheric neutrino data by the superkamiokande collaboration @xcite has confirmed the deficit of muon neutrinos , especially at small zenith angles , opening a new era in neutrino physics .",
    "although there may be alternative solutions of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly  @xcite it is fair to say that the simplest interpretation of the data is in terms of to flavour oscillations with maximal mixing .",
    "this excludes a large mixing among @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite , in agreement also with the chooz reactor data . on the other hand the persistent disagreement between solar neutrino data and theoretical expectations",
    "@xcite has been a long - standing problem in physics .",
    "recent solar neutrino data  @xcite are consistent with both vacuum oscillations and msw conversions . in the latter case",
    "one can have either the large or the small mixing angle solutions , with a slight trend towards the latter  @xcite .",
    "many attempts have appeared in the literature to explain the data .",
    "here we review recent results  @xcite obtained in a model  @xcite which is a simple extension of the mssm with with bilinear r - parity violation ( brpv ) . this model , despite being a minimal extension of the mssm , can explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "its most attractive feature is that it gives definite predictions for accelerator physics for the same range of parameters that explain the neutrino data .",
    "in the past most discussions of supersymmetric ( susy ) phenomenology assumed r ",
    "parity ( @xmath4 ) conservation where , r_p=(-1)^2j + 3b + l this implies that susy particles are pair produced , every susy particle decays into another susy particle and that there is a _",
    "lsp _ that it is stable .",
    "but this is just an _ ad hoc _ assumption without a deep justification . in this talk",
    "we will review how @xmath4 can be broken , either spontaneously or explicitly , and discuss the most important features of these models @xcite .        in the original proposal  @xcite the content was just the mssm and the breaking was induced by = v_l the problem with this model was that the majoron @xmath5 coupled to @xmath6 with gauge strength and therefore the decay @xmath7 contributed to the invisible @xmath8 width the equivalent of half a ( light ) neutrino family .",
    "after lep i this was excluded .      the way to avoid the previous difficulty is to enlarge the model and make @xmath5 mostly out of _ isosinglets_.",
    "this was proposed by masiero and valle  @xcite .",
    "the content is the mssm plus a few isosinglet superfields that carry lepton number .",
    "the model is defined by the superpotential @xcite , w&=&h_u u^c q h_u + h_d d^c q h_d + h_e e^c l h_d + & & + h_0 h_u h_d + ^3 + h _ ^c l h_u + h ^c s where the lepton number assignments are shown in .",

    "the majoron is given by the imaginary part of ( v_u h_u - v_d h_d ) + - + where @xmath10 .",
    "since the majoron is mainly an 1 singlet it does not contribute to the invisible @xmath6 decay width .      the sbrp model has been extensively studied .",
    "the implications for accelerator and non  accelerator physics have been presented before and we will not discuss them here @xcite . in this talk we will only review the results for neutrinos .",

    "neutrinos mix and the mixing is related to the the coupling matrix @xmath11 .",
