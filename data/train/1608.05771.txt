    "in order to quantify the properties of the qgp created in heavy - ion collisions , a solid understanding of the nuclear modification of particle spectra in cold nuclear matter is fundamentally important .",
    "@xmath0 production in proton - nucleus collisions provide an ideal tool to test the microscopic dynamics of medium - induced parton energy loss .",
    "drastic nuclear suppression effects are observed in a wide collision energy range for minimum bias p - a and d - a collisions , such as na3[1 ] , e772[2 ] , e866[3,4 ] , na50[5 ] , hear - b[6 ] , lhc[7,8 ] and rhic[9]experiments .",
    "however , it is striking that there is no consensus on the origin of @xmath0 suppression in some kinematical conditions[10 ] .",
    "some approaches attribute @xmath0 suppression to an effective absorption cross section @xmath7 of the @xmath8 pair[11 - 12 ] ; other models attribute @xmath0 suppression to the increase of the @xmath8 pair mvariant mass by the multiple soft rescatterings through the nucleus , leading to a reduction of the overlap with the @xmath0 wave function[13 ] .    in the nucleus rest frame ,",
    "a high - energy @xmath0 is formed long after the nucleus thus what actually propagates through the nucleus is the parent @xmath8 pair . our previous works[14 - 15 ] support that the nuclear modification on the parton distribution functions and the incident proton energy loss owing to multiple scattering on the surrounding nucleon and gluon radiation are the main initial state effects induced the @xmath0 suppression , and the energy loss of color octet @xmath8 is the dominant final state effect when the @xmath8 pair remains colored on its entire path in the medium . in paper[15 ] , by using the eps09 nuclear parton distributions [ 16 ] together with the energy loss of the proton beam in initial state ( the center - of - mass system energy loss per collision @xmath9 gev is determined from the nuclear drell - yan experimental data in the glauber model[17 ] . ) and the linear quark energy loss in final state , we extracted the charm quark mean energy loss per unit path length ( @xmath10gev / fm with @xmath11 ) by fitting the e866 experimental data [ 3,4 ] in the region @xmath12 .    to further investigate the microscopic dynamics of medium - induced parton energy loss ,",
    "the color charge of parton energy loss has received significant interest .",
    "this issue is of fundamental importance for accurately understanding the dynamics for modifying a hard probe and the dense qcd properties of what is probed .",
    "previous research [ 18 - 22 ] predict that : gluons lose more energy than quarks because of the stronger coupling to the medium .    in the @xmath0 production for",
    "p - a ( or d - a ) collisions , the observed suppression induced by the incident parton energy loss effect can give a better way to discriminatingly identify the energy loss of incoming gluon and quark .",
    "following our previous work , in the present study we investigate the incoming gluon energy loss effect by means of the e866[3,4 ] , rhic[9 ] and lhc[7,8 ] experimental data , and desire that our research can provide useful reference for deep understanding the microscopic dynamics of medium - induced parton energy loss .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the theoretical framework of our study is introduced .",
    "section iii is devoted to the results and discussion .",
    "finally , a summary is presented .",
    "in the the color evaporation model ( cem)[23 ] , for @xmath0 production in p - a collisions quarkonium production is treated identically to open heavy - quark production except that the invariant mass of the heavy quark pair is restricted to be less than twice the mass of the lightest meson that can be formed with one heavy constituent quark .",
    "for charmonium the upper limit on the @xmath8 pair mass is then @xmath13 .",
    "the hadroproduction of heavy quark at leading order ( lo ) in perturbative qcd is the sum of contributions from @xmath14 annihilation and @xmath15 fusion .",
    "the charmonium production cross section @xmath16 is a convolution of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 partonic cross sections with the parton distribution functions @xmath17 in the incident proton and @xmath18 in the target proton and expressed as [ 24 ] : @xmath19.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , in the rest frame of the target nuclei , @xmath20 is the projectile proton ( target ) parton momentum fractions , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the center of mass energy of the hadronic collision , @xmath23 , @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 gev are respectively the charm quark and d meson mass , @xmath26 is the lo @xmath8 partonic production cross section from the gluon fusion ( quark - antiquark annihilation ) , and @xmath27 is the fraction of @xmath8 pair which produces the @xmath0 state .    in @xmath0 production from",
    "p - a ( or d - a ) collisions , owing to multiple scattering on the surrounding nucleon and gluon radiation while incident parton propagating through the nucleus , the incoming gluon ( quark ) can lose its energy @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . the energy loss of incoming gluon ( quark ) results in an average change in its momentum fraction prior to the collision , @xmath30 according to the parametrization for parton energy loss [ 25 - 26 ] , the mean energy loss of incoming gluon ( quark ) can be expressed as : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 @xmath33 [ 27 ] , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the parameters that can be extracted from the experimental data by adopting the @xmath36 analysis method .",
    "when the @xmath0 hadronization occurs outside the nucleus , nuclear absorption should play little or no role and the energy loss of color octet @xmath8 is the dominant final state effect . in view of the shift in @xmath3 due to the energy loss of color octet @xmath8 ( @xmath37 ) ,",

    "further , considering the energy loss of incident gluon , incoming quark and the color octet @xmath8 , the leading order for @xmath0 production cross section ratios as a function of @xmath4 should be written as : @xmath45 here , @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "in order to determine the value of incoming gluon energy loss parameter @xmath34 , we give the phenomenological analysis at the leading order for @xmath0 production cross section ratios @xmath2 for the e866 experimental data ( 49 dots ) by using the eps09 nuclear parton distributions [ 16 ] together with the energy loss parameter of incident quark ( @xmath50 gev / fm ) determined from the nuclear drell - yan experimental data[26 ] and the color octet @xmath8 energy loss ( @xmath51 gev / fm ) determined in our previous work[15 ] . by minimizing @xmath36 with the cern subroutine minuit [ 28 ] the value of parameter @xmath34 are extracted : @xmath52",
    "gev / fm . one standard deviation of the optimum parameter corresponds to an increase of @xmath53 by 1 unit from its minimum @xmath54 .",
    "the result indicates that the incoming gluons lose more energy than the incident quarks in @xmath0 production from p - a collisions , which is in accord with the prediction that gluons lose more energy than quarks because of the stronger coupling to the medium[18 - 22 ] .",
    "in addition , due to the effects of the modification of the gluon parton distribution functions on the nucleus leading to an additional @xmath0 suppression in p - a collisions , the eps09 uncertainties can be the main source of uncertainties associated to our results .    to identify the energy loss effect of the incoming gluon and incident quark on the @xmath0 suppression , the theoretical results are compared with e866 experimental data[3,4 ] at @xmath5 gev in figure 1 ( figure 2 ) , rhic experimental data[9 ] at @xmath55 gev in figure 3 , and lhc experimental data[7,8 ] at @xmath6 tev in figure 4 , respectively .",
    "the dotted , dashed and solid lines correspond to the results given without initial state energy loss , by considering the incident quark energy loss effect , and the energy loss of incident quark together with incoming gluon energy loss .",

    "we can see that the dotted line and the dashed line appears to overlap , which indicate that the energy loss effect due to the incoming quark play no role on the @xmath0 production at the rhic energy .",
    "in contrast , the nuclear suppression due to the incident gluon energy loss is obvious especially in the range @xmath65 , reduces gradually with the increase of @xmath4 , and becomes ignored in @xmath66 .",
    "as also can be seen in figure 4 , the incident quark energy loss effect has little impact on the @xmath0 production cross section ratio @xmath63 at the lhc energy , and the energy loss due to the incoming gluon plays an important role on the nuclear suppression especially in the range @xmath67 , reduces gradually with the increase of @xmath4 , and becomes ignored in @xmath68 . in the present work",
