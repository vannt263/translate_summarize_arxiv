    "supersymmetry ( susy ) has been the focus of a great deal of experimental effort due to the requirement that the superparticles have masses of @xmath4(1 ) tev or less in order to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "thus there exists the possibility of producing susy particles at present and the next generation of colliders .",
    "the phenomonelogy of such production depends on the nature of the supersymmetry breaking . in typical theories of susy breaking ,",
    "the effects of this breaking , which occurs in a  hidden sector \" , are communicated to the  visible sector \" ( which includes the usual particles and their superpartners ) by a  messenger sector \" . searches for susy have mostly been inspired by gravity mediated susy breaking theories . in these theories , the lightest neutralino is usually the lightest suspersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , the lsp is stable and the decay chains of all other susy particles must eventually produce it .",
    "the lsp leaves the detector undetected thereby making large missing transverse energy ( + 0.55em ) an important part of the signature for susy . in spite of extensive experimental searches , so far no experimental evidence for susy has been found at the tevatron @xcite or at lep @xcite except for one possible @xmath5 plus + 0.55em  event at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "recently , gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models have become very popular .",
    "the defining characteristic of gmsb models is that the messenger particles interact with visible sector particles via gauge interactions . in these theories ,",
    "the gravitino is the lsp .",
    "most phenomenological studies and experimental searches that have used gmsb as a framework have taken the next to lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) to be the lightest neutralino .",
    "when this is the case , the @xmath6 decays to a photon and a gravitino ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "if this decay takes place within the detector , the signal involves high @xmath0 photons accompanied by large + 0.55em  @xcite . for much of the parameter space ,",
    "however , the lighter of the two scalar staus is the nlsp . in this case",
    ", the decays of susy particles produce the @xmath8 which subsequently decays to a @xmath1 and a gravitino .",
    "if the @xmath8 decays occur within the detector , signatures for susy production will then generally include @xmath1 leptons from the @xmath8 decays and + 0.55em  due to the stable gravitinos and neutrinos leaving the detector .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that gmsb models where the @xmath9 is the nlsp can lead to unusual and distinguishing signatures for gaugino production . at the tevatron , these signals arise from chargino pair production ( @xmath10 ) and from the production of the chargino with the second neutralino ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the subsequent decays involve multiple high @xmath0 @xmath1 leptons and possibly substantial + 0.55em .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze in detail the signals for these decay modes at the tevatron .",
    "in particular , we seek to determine the production rates for various distinguishing final states , the @xmath12 spectrum of the @xmath1 jets , and the + 0.55em   distribution for the events .",
    "since the observed signal depends on the masses of the sparticles , we first begin by describing the model and the corresponding mass spectrum . in our model ,",
    "the messenger sector consists of some number of multiplets that are @xmath13 representations of su(5 ) .",
    "they couple to a chiral superfield @xmath14 in the hidden sector whose scalar component has a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath15 and whose auxiliary component has a vev @xmath16 . by imposing the requirement that the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry is broken radiatively , the particle spectrum and the mixing angles depend on five parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath17 is the messenger scale .",
    "@xmath18 is equal to @xmath16/@xmath15 and is related to the susy breaking scale .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is dictated by the choice of the vector - like messenger sector and can take the values 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 to satisfy the perturbative unification constraint .",
    "the definition of @xmath20 is taken as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the vev for the up - type ( @xmath23 ) higgs doublet and @xmath24 is the vev for the down - type ( @xmath25 ) higgs doublet .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is the coefficient in the bilinear term , @xmath26 , in the superpotential .",
    "constraints coming from @xmath27 strongly favor negative values for @xmath3 @xcite and , in the cases considered in this work , @xmath3 is taken to be negative .",
    "demanding that the ew symmetry be broken radiatively fixes the magnitude of @xmath3 and the parameter @xmath28 ( from the @xmath29 term in the scalar potential ) in terms of the other parameters of the theory .",
    "the soft susy breaking gaugino and scalar masses at the messenger scale are given by [ gmass ] m_i(m ) = n g ( ) and [ smass ] m^2(m ) = 2 n f ( ) ^3_i = 1 k_i c_i ( ) ^2 ^2 where the @xmath30 are the three sm gauge couplings and @xmath31 1 , 1 , and 3/5 for su(3 ) , su(2 ) , and u(1 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath32 are zero for gauge singlets and are 4/3 , 3/4 , and ( @xmath33/2)@xmath34 for the fundamental representations of su(3 ) , su(2 ) , and u(1 ) , respectively ( with @xmath33 given by @xmath35 ) . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are messenger scale threshold functions .",
    "we calculate the sparticle masses at the scale @xmath17 using eqs .",
    "( [ gmass ] ) and ( [ smass ] ) and run these to the electroweak scale using the appropriate rges@xcite .",
    "@xmath38 is calculated by minimizing the 1 loop corrected higgs potential @xcite .    the decay chain and hence the signature for the events depends on the particles initially produced as well as the hierarchy of the masses .",
    "given the current lower bounds on squark and gluino masses , the production of strongly interacting sparticles is probably not a viable search modes for susy at the tevatron run ii .",
    "a more likely mechanism for producing susy particles is via ew gaugino production . at the tevatron , chargino pair ( @xmath10 ) production takes place through s - channel @xmath39 and @xmath40 exchange and @xmath41 production is through s - channel @xmath42 exchange .",
    "squark exchange via the t - channel also contributes to both processes , but the contributions are expected to be negligible since the squark masses are large in gmsb models .",
    "the production of @xmath43 is suppressed due to the smallness of the coupling involved .    since susy breaking",
    "is communicated to the visible sector by gauge interactions , the mass differences between the superparticles depend on the their gauge interactions .",
    "this creates a hierarchy in mass between electroweak and strongly interacting sparticles .",
    "eq.([gmass ] ) shows that the gluino is more massive than charginos and neutralinos , while eq.([smass ] ) shows that squarks are considerably more massive than sleptons .",
    "given this hierarchy of sparticle masses , there are roughly four possible cases to consider for ew gaugino production :    case 1 : : :    @xmath44 case 2 : : :    @xmath45 case 3 : : :    @xmath46 case 4 : : :    @xmath47    the three sneutrino masses are nearly the same . the lighter of the selectrons and smuons are essentially right handed and have the same mass . also , for all the parameter points we considered , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are nearly degenerate .",
    "the possible final states configurations at the tevatron depend on the sparticle spectrum , but they will have certain aspects in common . since the @xmath8 is the nlsp , the various possible decays modes will ( usually ) produce at least two @xmath1 leptons arising from the decays of the @xmath8 s . in addition , there can also be large + 0.55em  due to the stable gravitinos and neutrinos escaping detection .",
    "we now give a detailed analysis of the possible tevatron signatures for gaugino production in the context of gmsb models where the lightest stau is the nlsp .",
    "as mentioned above , the production of susy particles in these models leads to the production of copious quantities of @xmath1 leptons .",
    "since the lightest chargino is mostly wino , it couples mainly to left - handed sfermions .",
    "thus , for the examples considered here , the dominant decay mode of the chargino is typically @xmath50 due to the significant mixing of the left and right handed staus and the low mass of the @xmath8 . with the subsequent decay @xmath51 , the expectation is that there are typically two @xmath1 leptons produced in chargino pair production .",
    "similarly , @xmath52 is typically the dominant decay mode of the second lightest neutralino . in @xmath11 production",
    "we therefore expect three @xmath1 leptons : one directly from the @xmath53 decay and the other from the @xmath8 decays .",
    "so in combined @xmath10/@xmath11 production , the expectation is that there will be a significant number of events with two and three @xmath1 leptons .",
    "@xmath1 leptons are identified by their hadronic decays to thin jets ; thus we are interested in the probabilities for obtaining final states with particular numbers of @xmath1-jets .",
    "this analysis is performed in the context of the main injector ( mi ) and tev33 upgrades of the tevatron collider .",
    "the center of mass energy is taken to be @xmath54tev and the integrated luminosity is taken to be 2fb@xmath55 for the mi upgrade and 30fb@xmath55 for the tev33 upgrade @xcite .    in performing this analysis , the cuts employed are that final state charged leptons must have @xmath56gev and a pseudorapidity , @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the polar angle with respect to the proton beam direction ) , of magnitude less than 1 .",
    "jets must have @xmath59gev and @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , hadronic final states within a cone size of @xmath61 are merged to a single jet .",
    "leptons within this cone radius of a jet are discounted . for a @xmath1-jet to be counted as such",
    ", it must have @xmath62 .",
    "the most energetic @xmath1 jet is required to have @xmath63gev .",
    "in addition , a missing transverse energy cut of + 0.55em  @xmath64gev is imposed .",
    "we consider each mass case in turn . in our analysis , we restrict ourselves to those regions of the parameter space where the @xmath8 decays promptly to a @xmath1 and a gravitino . the parameter space is also restricted to those regions where @xmath65 gev .",
    "ongoing lepii analyses are expected to establish this bound soon @xcite . with this restriction",
    ", we did not find any examples for cases 3 and 4 .",
    "we consider three examples of this case ; the masses and branching ratios of which are given in table [ mass1 ] .",
    "we first consider example  1 which has @xmath67 , @xmath68tev , @xmath69tev , and @xmath70 .",
    "chargino pair production is particularly simple for this case as @xmath50 is not only the dominant decay mode , but is essentially the only decay mode .",
    "thus in chargino pair production , two @xmath1 leptons are always produced .",
    "@xmath11 production is almost as simple .",
    "the main decay mode of the second heaviest neutralino is @xmath52 with a branching ratio ( br ) of 85.3% , while the only other decay modes are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus the production probability for three @xmath1 leptons is high at 85.3% and the three @xmath1-jet rate is correspondingly 27.2% .",
    "example 2 ( @xmath73 , @xmath74tev , @xmath75tev , and @xmath76 ) and example  3 ( @xmath73 , @xmath77tev , @xmath78tev , and @xmath76 ) are similar .",
    "@xmath50 is still very much the dominant decay mode , but in these cases @xmath79 now occurs with a small but significant br . on the other hand ,",
    "the br for @xmath52 is closer to unity at the expense of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the question arises as to how high we can expect the @xmath12 of the @xmath1-jets to be .",
    "[ f1l ] give the @xmath12 distribution of the highest @xmath12 @xmath1-jet for example  1 .",
    "the pseudorapidity cut of @xmath62 on @xmath1-jets has been imposed in fig .",
    "[ f1l](b ) .",
    "the peak in the distribution occurs at about 20gev with a broad tail that reaches out beyond 120gev .",
    "thus the leading @xmath1-jets are relatively hard and many will pass the transverse energy cut of @xmath63gev .",
    "the next to highest @xmath12 @xmath1-jet is significantly different as fig .",
    "[ f1s ] shows . here",
    "the distribution peaks at a lower value of about 10gev and hardly extends at all above 80gev . due to this softness of the secondary @xmath1-jets",
    ", many of the @xmath1-jets will tend to be eliminated by the cuts .",
    "for example  1 , an @xmath12 cut of 10gev on @xmath1-jets eliminates about a third of the second highest @xmath12 @xmath1-jets in those events with more than 1 @xmath1-jet .    also of interest",
    "is the + 0.55em  distribution . with energetic and stable gravitinos and",
    "neutrinos produced in the decays , it is expected that large missing transverse energy could be an important part of the signal .",
    "since the missing transverse energy is calculated from what is observed , however , the question arises as to whether significant cancellation occurs due to the many decay products .",
    "[ f1 m ] gives the + 0.55em  distribution for example  1 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the + 0.55em  distribution is indeed broad with a tail reaching out beyond 120gev .",
    "the peak occurs at about 25gev and so a 30gev cut should not be too restrictive .",
    "examples 2 and 3 have even harder + 0.55em  distributions since their gaugino masses are larger than for example  1 .",
    "since the + 0.55em  is calculated from what is observable , the spike at + 0.55em  = 0 is due to events where none of the jets or charged leptons meet the cuts .    we now consider the specifics of the various final state possibilities .",
    "table [ e1it ] gives the inclusive branching ratios for different numbers of @xmath1-jets for example  1 .",
    "as indicated above , this example always produces two @xmath1 leptons in chargino pair production .",
    "before cuts the inclusive branching ratio for the 2 @xmath1-jet mode in chargino pair production is 41.2% , while the 1 @xmath1-jet inclusive branching ratio is 45.6% .",
    "after the cuts specified above , the branching ratios are cut down rather substantially .",
    "the one @xmath1-jet br becomes 22.5% and the two @xmath1-jet br is 9.0% .",
    "similar results also hold for the other two cases : for example  2 , the branching ratios for which are given in table [ e2it ] , the before cuts br for the 2 @xmath1-jet inclusive br is 42.0% and the br for the 1 @xmath1-jet inclusive br is 45.0% .",
    "there is also a small rate for 3 @xmath1-jets due to one of the @xmath80 decaying via the @xmath79 mode followed by the decay @xmath81 .",
    "the cuts do nt eliminate as many of the @xmath1-jets for this case as the lightest chargino is more massive than for example 1 .",
    "after cuts the two @xmath1-jet inclusive br is 13% and the one @xmath1-jet inclusive br is 29% .",
    "similar results hold for example 3 , see table [ e3it ] .",
    "@xmath11 production most frequently produces 3 @xmath1 leptons and thus there is the possibility of having 3 @xmath1-jets in these events . for example  1 , the br before cuts for 3 @xmath1-jets is 27.2% , while after cuts this goes down to 3.6% .",
    "the probability for 2 @xmath1-jets here is larger than for chargino pair production : before cuts the br is 44.4% and after cuts the br is 17.3% . as in the chargino pair case ,",
    "the reduction after cuts for examples 2 and 3 is less .",
    "for example 2 , the inclusive 3 @xmath1-jet br before cuts is 27.6% and after the cuts it is 5.7% .",
    "the question now arises as to the observability of these modes at tevatron s run ii .",
    "for example  1 , table [ e1it ] indicates that the inclusive 3 @xmath1-jet rate for combined @xmath10 and @xmath11 production is 9.6fb . for an integrated luminosity of 2fb@xmath55",
    "( approximately what is expected initially during run ii ) , this corresponds to @xmath8219 observable events . for 30fb@xmath55 ,",
    "the number of observable events is @xmath82288 .",
    "the 2 @xmath1-jets cross section of 62.8fb gives @xmath82126 events for 2fb@xmath55 of data and @xmath821880 events for 30fb@xmath55 of data .",
    "for example  2 , the numbers are lower due to the large masses of the charginos and neutralinos . for 2fb@xmath55 ( 30fb@xmath55 ) of data ,",
    "the expected number of events for the 3 @xmath1-jet mode is about 8 ( 126 ) , while for the 2 @xmath1-jet mode the expectation is for 49 ( 737 ) .",
    "the number of observed events will be less depending on the @xmath1-jet detection efficiency .",
    "the branching ratios for some of the important individual modes are given in table [ chgno1 ] for chargino pair production and table [ nlino1 ] for @xmath11 production .",
    "the electrons and muons are typically too soft to pass the cuts and thus requiring an @xmath2 or @xmath3 to enhance the signal over background probably will be of little help .",
    "we consider three examples of this case , the masses of which are given in table [ mass2 ] and the branching ratios are given in table [ br2 ] .",
    "this case is more complicated than the previous one due to the shifting of the sneutrino masses below that of @xmath80 and @xmath53 and also to the shifting of the selectron and smuon masses below the mass of the lightest neutralino . as a consequence ,",
    "there are now many more decay modes for @xmath80 and @xmath53 .",
    "the dominant decay mode of the lightest chargino is still @xmath84 , but now the decays to the sneutrinos are also important .",
    "in fact , the decay to the sneutrinos can have branching ratios approaching that of the decay to the stau : for example 5 , which has @xmath85 , @xmath86tev , @xmath87tev , and @xmath88 , we have br(@xmath50 ) = 0.279 , while br(@xmath89 ) = 0.237 .",
    "for the second lightest neutralino , the dominant decay mode for these examples is @xmath52 .",
    "but , as with the decays of the lightest chargino , here the decays to the sneutrinos are important .",
    "the branching ratio for the decays of the @xmath53 to the sneutrinos tend to range from 10% to 20% each .",
    "another important difference in this case from the last one is that @xmath90 and @xmath91 have a lower mass than the lightest neutralino and therefore can not decay to it .",
    "then the only two - body decay modes for @xmath90 and @xmath92 that preserve @xmath93-parity are @xmath94 and @xmath95 . given the smallness of the coupling involved , there is the possibility that some three - body decays are important . for @xmath90",
    "these are @xmath96 and @xmath97 with corresponding decays for @xmath92 .",
    "these three - body decays are dominant for all three examples studied .",
    "we now consider the details of the various final state possibilities .",
    "table [ e4it ] gives the inclusive branching ratios for different numbers of @xmath1-jets for example 4 .",
    "given the multitude of decay possibilities presented in table [ br2 ] , up to six @xmath1 leptons can be produced in @xmath10 events .",
    "moreover , virtually all events produce @xmath1 leptons since the @xmath94 and @xmath95 decays have nearly negligible branching ratios at the expense of the @xmath1 producing three - body modes .",
    "before cuts the inclusive branching ratio for the three @xmath1-jet mode in chargino pair production is 29.0% , for the two @xmath1-jet mode it s 33.8% , and for the one @xmath1-jet mode it s 18.0% .",

    "similar results also hold for example  6 as shown in table [ e6it ] .    in principle , up to seven @xmath1 leptons can be produced in @xmath11 events albeit the seven @xmath1 branching ratio is negligible .",
    "the main modes of interest are still the one , two , and three @xmath1-jet modes .",
