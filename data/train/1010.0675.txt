    "luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) whose total infrared luminosities , , are in the range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , are among the most important populations for the study of galaxy evolution .",
    "their extreme  signifies intense star formation hidden by dust and only visible through the infrared ( ir ) emission resulting from the reprocessing of uv photons that originate from populations of rapidly forming hot young stars .",
    "they are among the most extreme star - forming regions known .",
    "a majority of the local ulirgs are disturbed systems of galaxies undergoing mergers .",
    "some ulirgs harbor active galactic nuclei ( agn ) often thought to be associated with merger activity and the resulting enhanced dense molecular gas fractions observed in the nuclei of these systems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "locally , luminous ir galaxies are very rare @xcite but they contribute significantly to the total ir energy density beyond redshift @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at high redshift ,",
    "@xmath6 , luminous ir galaxies are typified by submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so far it is common to view smgs as a more luminous counterpart of local ulirgs .",
    "this naturally leads to the view of smgs being disturbed , interacting systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , there are many indications that the seds of the high redshift infrared galaxies differ systematically from those of local galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "@xcite found that the 70 @xmath7 ( observed ) outputs tended to be weaker relative to those at 24 @xmath7 ( observed ) than expected from local templates .",
    "many authors have found that the aromatic bands in these galaxies appear to be similar in structure to those in significantly lower - luminosity local galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the far infrared seds appear to be cold , again similar to those of lower luminosity local galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these findings suggest an underlying physical difference between local luminous infrared galaxies and those at high redshift .",
    "@xcite suggested that such a difference might arise either through reduced metallicity or lower optical depth due to a greater extent of the emitting regions .",
    "@xcite find that the metallicities are of order three times lower at @xmath8 for a given galaxy mass .",
    "@xcite show that , for local galaxies , there is only a weak trend in 8 @xmath7 vs.  down to @xmath9 solar metallicity , and that at lower metallicity the 8 @xmath7 luminosity is suppressed .",
    "this correlation is also reported for @xmath10 galaxies by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that reduced metallicity is unlikely to be the primary cause of the changes in sed with redshift .",
    "we therefore turn our attention to the second possibility , that the galaxies have structures different from local ones of similar luminosity .",
    "recent high - resolution studies of smgs in the submillimeter , radio , and near - ir have shown that their star - forming regions are generally relatively extended , with diameters of order @xmath11 kpc @xcite .",
    "thus , the surface densities of the star formation rate ( sfr ) must be substantially lower in the high - z galaxies than for the local ones of similar .",
    "this paper explores the importance of this difference in explaining the different sed behavior .",
    "we make the simplest possible assumption , that the sed is a function of the sfr surface density , , and that galaxies with similar , and consequently similar  surface density , , will have similar optical depths in their star forming regions and similar seds . in section [ sec : data ] , we describe the compilation of data for the study as well as discuss our derivation of a consistent set of sizes for the star forming regions for @xmath12 .",
    "section [ sec : results ] shows the results and discusses the implications for both galaxy evolution and for improved estimates of the sfrs of high redshift ir galaxies .",
    "we assume a @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16  km  s@xmath17mpc@xmath17 throughout this paper .",
    "a major challenge in studying the  of galaxies across a broad redshift range is to obtain physical size information for the ir - emitting regions in a consistent way for both the local and high - redshift samples .",
    "we discuss in this section the compilation of physical sizes and ir luminosity data from the literature and our steps to compare them on the same metric . despite the abundantly available high - quality data for local galaxies ,",
    "it is necessary to select a subset that can best match the high - redshift sample .",
    "we therefore will begin our discussion with the high - redshift compilation , then follow with the local compilation .",
    "the past five years have seen an unprecedented number of high - resolution , multiwavelengths observations of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "our compilation of the physical sizes of intermediate and high - redshift starburst galaxies is based on radio interferometric observations at the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) and the very large array ( vla ) , as well as submillimeter interferometric observations at the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) .",
    "submillimeter and 1.4 ghz observations , rather than rest - frame optical or near - ir , are chosen because they closely trace the star - forming regions of galaxies while being little affected by the old stellar light .",
    "the submillimeter is a more direct tracer in this regard because it observes thermal emission from dust while the 1.4 ghz data probe synchrotron radiation from supernovae remnants , whose progenitors are short - lived massive stars and hence indirectly trace star - formation .",
    "because of the radio - infrared relation within galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radio observations should give a valid measure of the size of the active region in a star forming galaxy .",
    "@xcite report that the ir - radio relation could evolve at high redshifts .",
    "however , their reported evolution law given by @xmath18 is small and unlikely to affect significantly our estimation of ir - emitting region size using radio observations .",
    "@xcite , along with a recent result using _ herschel _ by @xcite , also found little or no evolution in the ir - radio relation at @xmath19 .",
    "although submillimeter transitions ( e.g. co ) are more direct tracers of molecular clouds and star - forming regions than is radio emission , they tend to trace colder gas . in comparison ,",
    "the star - forming regions in most local lirgs and ulirgs are sub - kpc in size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus the physical size given by submillimeter observation tends to be systematically larger than that of radio observations .",
    "moreover , selection of high - redshift submillimeter galaxies will tend to result in a sample with colder seds , which are brighter in submillimeter wavelengths , and hence an inherently physically extended sample .",
    "this bias towards larger physical size should be more pronounced for the low@xmath20 co transitions such as co ( @xmath21 ) and co ( @xmath22 ) and thus we will adopt sizes from higher@xmath20 co transitions such as co ( @xmath23 ) and co ( @xmath24 ) if available . to be conservative , we will take the radio sizes to be the physical size of the star - forming region in galaxies and treat submillimeter sizes as upper limits to isolate this possible selection effect .",
    "the submillimeter data were compiled from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors used the iram pdbi to study submillimeter - selected samples using co transitions with @xmath25 to @xmath26 resolution .",
    "@xcite observed six smgs , including four sources from @xcite and @xcite , and two new sources at redshifts @xmath27 .",
    "their observations yield four resolved smgs with a median fwhm diameter of @xmath28 kpc .",
    "one of the @xcite sources needs to be excluded because its radio emission is significantly stronger than predicted by the ir - radio relation , indicating the presence of an agn .",
    "@xcite reported the physical sizes ( effective co diameters ) of two sources in the extended groth strip at redshifts @xmath29 to be 13 and 16 kpc in diameter , which they have found to be smaller but consistent with the size based on an i - band observation .",
    "it should be noted that although @xcite find the smgs to be `` compact '' , they still generally are a factor of 100 larger in area than local ulirgs of similar ir luminosities .",
    "additionally , @xcite reported sizes of four bzk - selected @xmath30 star - forming galaxies ( one member of this sample also has 1.4 ghz size measurement from @xcite , which we adopt in preference to the co data ) . in total",
    "we have eight data points from the submillimeter observations ; three from @xcite , two from @xcite , and three from @xcite .",
    "ir luminosities for these eight galaxies were estimated via the @xcite formalism based on 24 @xmath7 fluxes from @xcite , @xcite , and _ spitzer _",

    "the 1.4 ghz radio observations were drawn from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used merlin+vla with @xmath31 resolution to study 12 smgs selected from the hdf at a median redshift of @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 of their targets were resolved with an effective median diameter measured above the @xmath34 contour of @xmath35 kpc .",
    "@xcite used merlin+vla to observe 12 smgs in the lockman hole at @xmath36 with @xmath37 resolution ( all sources were resolved ) .",
    "the sample was selected from smgs found by surveys carried out with scuba and mambo @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported physical sizes of these smgs ranging from @xmath38 kpc with a median of 5 kpc .",
    "lastly , @xcite used merlin ( @xmath39 resolution ) to observe seven ulirgs and a hylirg selected by optical and radio color criteria from goods and the lockman hole at redshifts @xmath40 .",
    "they resolved all eight and report an average physical diameter of @xmath41 kpc , corresponding to the surface area within the @xmath34 detection level .",
    "@xcite used merlin+vla to conduct a deep 1.4 ghz survey of the hdf and hubble flanking field ( hff ) and studied 92 radio sources at @xmath42 with @xmath37 resolution .",
    "all but one source was resolved .",
    "for this study , we exclude sources that @xcite classified as agn or agn candidates .",
    "we also exclude the muxlow sources that are observed only by the vla and hence have lower resolution that may affect the accuracy of size estimates , as well as those with complex morphology such that their size estimation requires visual inspection @xcite .",
    "out of 92 objects from the @xcite sample , 72 have spectroscopic redshifts and 27 pass the aforementioned criterion and have a 24 @xmath7 counterpart in goods .",
    "@xcite reported sizes in terms of the largest angular size determined by gaussian fitting @xcite . taking the largest angular size , which is the size of the major axis , as the diameter directly would overestimate the surface area ; we assume that the sizes of the minor axes of these galaxies are 0.6 of the major - axis ( the largest angular fwhm ) and",
    "then calculate the surface areas and circularized diameters for the @xcite sample as reported in table [ table_highz ] .",
    "this value is an average ratio of minor - to - major axes of smgs from the @xcite sample .",
    "an average physical diameter for the @xcite sample is @xmath43 kpc .  for the @xcite , the @xcite , and",
    "the @xcite samples in the goods field were estimated via the @xcite formalism and the _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath7 imaging in goods .  for the @xcite and the @xcite samples in other fields",
    "are also estimated using the @xcite formalism based on the 24 @xmath7 fluxes reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "apparently there are two approaches in reporting galaxy sizes from the radio measurements : the deconvolved fwhm @xcite and the circularized diameter enclosing the surface area of the @xmath44 radio detections @xcite . despite the methodological differences between these two approaches , they agree very well for the objects with overlapping observations , especially in the hdf where there are six such galaxies .",
    "this agreement is expected , since the area detected above @xmath45 is likely to be consistent with that of half - max power given the typical levels of signal to noise ratio in the observations .",
    "we also note a very good agreement of sizes from 1.4 ghz and co ( @xmath23 ) observations of a hdf object , smmj123707 + 6214sw , where observations from @xcite and @xcite overlap .",
    "although galaxies drawn from the aforementioned samples are likely dominated by star - forming activity , we independently confirm this by inspecting whether their ratio of 850 @xmath7 and 1.4 ghz fluxes follows the ir - radio relation for starburst galaxies given by @xcite .",
    "galaxies with radio flux significantly stronger than predicted by the ir - radio relation likely harbor radio - loud agn .",
    "indeed , we have found that the only two objects with f@xmath46f@xmath47 are the most compact objects in our compilation ( consistent with agn - domination ) and thus we exclude these objects ( smmj163650.43 + 405734.5 and smmj105207.49 + 571904.0 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this test is unnecessary for the @xcite sample , where both radio spectral slope and radio morphology are already employed to identify agn and agn candidates .    in total",
    "our compilation has 48 intermediate and high - redshift starburst galaxies with a median redshift of 1.0 and a median size of 5.1 kpc .",
    "our primary sample comprises the 27 galaxies from @xcite , which should provide an unbiased and complete sample , selected by radio flux alone .",
    "the results from the additional 21 galaxies are consistent with those from the @xcite observations .      for local galaxies",
    ", there is no homogeneous set of radio or submillimeter images suitable for our needs .",
    "therefore , we use two additional measures of the star formation rate , paschen-@xmath48 images @xcite and images at 24 @xmath7 from a number of sources . as with the radio ,",
    "both measures are not strongly affected by extinction and are good tracers of star forming activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although radio images of local galaxies have somewhat larger extent than these other indicators , the high surface brightness areas that would dominate the high - redshift measurement have very similar morphologies and sizes @xcite .",
    "the high redshift galaxies have limited structural information , typically equivalent to a fwhm from gaussian fitting or deconvolution of the observed image , in which the galaxy is only modestly well resolved .",
    "the fwhm of the beam is typically @xmath31 to @xmath49 .",
    "a @xmath49 beam corresponds to a diameter of 5 kpc at @xmath50 , 7.5 kpc at @xmath51 , and 8.5 kpc at @xmath52 .",
    "however , the images of local galaxies often provide many more resolution elements across the target . to put them on the same scale as the radio images at high redshift",
    ", we convolved them with a gaussian beam , and then determined sizes by gaussian fitting and deconvolution .",
    "we demonstrate with a typical case of local star - forming galaxy in fig .",
    "[ local_conv ] that this method yields a robust measurement of physical sizes for local galaxies .",
    "despite our efforts to put all the images on the same basis , a possible source of systematic error remains .",
    "an image with low signal to noise will tend not to go as far into the wings of the star - forming activity and hence there will be a tendency for a systematic reduction in the estimated fwhm with decreasing signal to noise .",
    "thus , the sizes of the high - redshift galaxies may be underestimated compared with the local ones .",
    "since the major result of this paper is that the high - z galaxies have substantially larger sizes than local ones of similar luminosity , the result is that we may understate this conclusion , not that it would be undermined .",
    "we describe our compilation of local ir galaxies in detail in the appendix .",
    "it comprises 19 normal star - forming galaxies ( @xmath53 ) , 21 luminous ir galaxies ( lirg , @xmath54 ) , and 4 ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirg , @xmath55 ) .",
    "since 36 of 48 high - redshift galaxies in our sample are in the hubble deep field imaged by the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; dickinson et al .",

    "using the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) on the _ hubble _ space telescope , we investigate the goods imaging ( version 2.0 ) of these galaxies in the b , v , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 bands .",
    "details about the acs observations of goods as well as the data can be found in @xcite and at the survey s website .",
    "goods optical images are used to confirm independently that the sizes and positions of the star - forming regions determined by radio or submillimeter observations are consistent with the high - resolution optical observations .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes of the radio and submillimeter observations are @xmath58 while the optical imaging in goods / acs has resolution at @xmath59pixel .",
    "although the radio and submillimeter observations can constrain the size of the star formation regions without being affected by stellar emission , their interpretation benefits from high - resolution optical imaging , especially for morphological classifications . we illustrate the circularized size for the star - forming regions compared to the optical extents of their host galaxies as seen in various optical filters in fig .",
    "[ goods ] .",
    "the star - forming regions seen at radio and submillimeter wavelengths typically coincide with the central part of the optical structure , but there are a few cases where the star - forming region is at the collision interface of an interacting system ( e.g. j123714 + 621558 , j123716 + 621643 ) .",
    "we will discuss our qualitative assessment of optical morphologies to address the structure of high - redshift star - forming galaxies in   [ sec : results_unified ] .",
    "our determinations of the physical sizes and luminosities for star - forming galaxies from the local sample out to the high - redshift smgs are summarized in fig .",
    "[ ltir_size ] .",
    "we find the physical sizes of star - forming galaxies to be comparable within an order of magnitude across the entire ir luminosity ( @xmath60 ) and redshift range ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "however , given the inhomogeneity of the methods employed to estimate uncertainties in each of the subsamples comprising our compilation , we expect the uncertainty for this formal slope to encompass the slope of unity and hence suggest that the two parameters are proportional to each other .    local lirgs and ulirgs have @xmath62 orders of magnitude higher  than indicated by this correlation suggesting that the starburst regions in these galaxies are not representative of their high - redshift counterparts of similar .",
    "in fact , local ulirgs with  @xmath63 have a comparable  to high - redshift smgs with  @xmath64 .",
    "the aforementioned correlation suggests an explanation for the strong aromatic emissions as well as the seds of star - forming galaxies at high redshift . if we assume that , and",

    "[ ltir_density_z ] would suggest that @xmath65 ulirgs have similar environments to local lirgs with an order of magnitude lower , and likewise @xmath8 smgs have similar environments to local ulirgs with two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "we test this possibility with three independent approaches .",
    "first , we compare the logarithmic ratio of @xmath66 flux and 1.4 ghz flux , log(s@xmath67/s@xmath68 ) or , predicted by the seds of local lirgs and ulirgs and the observed flux ratio for high - redshift galaxies . at redshift",
    "@xmath69 the _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath7 observed bandpass probes rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath70 and thus at these redshifts is highly sensitive to emission from aromatic complexes , which are sensitive to the star formation environment .",
    "we first investigate the intrinsic scatter of  by considering the scatter observed locally derived from the _ iras _ and vla observations , shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "if we assume a similar scatter around the mean value of  and project this scatter to higher redshifts , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ q24 ] demonstrates that the observed scatter at high redshift is within the expected scatter based on local observations .",
    "we then show in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ q24 ] that  for high - redshift galaxies is consistent with the ratios from local lirgs and ulirgs with significantly lower .",
    "consider the smgs at @xmath71 with  @xmath72 ; the correlation in fig .",
    "[ ltir_density_z ] suggests their starburst environment to be similar to local ulirgs with  @xmath63  and  is clearly inconsistent with the extrapolation for local ulirgs at  @xmath72  while agreeing with the sed for  @xmath63  local ulirgs .",
    "another way to interpret this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ q24_z_ratio ] that the aromatic features are significantly stronger compared to local sed templates at redshifts greater than @xmath1 .",
    "second , we consider a result from @xcite , specifically their fig .",

    "[ ltir_density_z ] ; high - redshift galaxies with  of @xmath77  would have  similar to local galaxies with an order of magnitude lower .",

    "these tests support our hypothesis that  is a valid tracer for the starburst environment and the observable spectral features .",
    "more importantly , they independently confirm that high - redshift star - forming galaxies , including smgs , have similar star - forming environments to local normal star - forming galaxies and their higher star - formation rate is primarily due to higher @xmath82 .",
    "we believe from the nearly consistent sizes of local and high - redshift star - forming galaxies that the most significant evolution between these two populations is in the . in other words , while the sizes of these galaxies remain about the same , their star formation rate densities increase greatly from normal star - forming galaxies to smgs .",
    "apart from many high - resolution observations of high - redshift smgs that find them to be physically extended systems , recent observations of the 158 @xmath7 [ cii ] line provide another probe into the environment of the star - forming regions .",
    "the [ cii ] line is an important cooling line for the photodissociation regions at the surfaces of molecular clouds . combining this [ cii ] line with the co ( @xmath21 ) line yields a color - color diagram of l@xmath83}/$]l@xmath84 vs. l@xmath85l@xmath86 that is sensitive to both the incident uv flux and the gas density .",

    "this behavior suggests a galaxy - wide starburst . @xcite",

    "they resolved the galaxy into four @xmath94pc massive star - forming regions distributed across the projected distance of 1.5 kpc , directly confirming the distributed nature of the galaxy - wide star formation .",
    "the optical morphologies of the subsample observed by goods , shown in fig . [ goods ] , suggest that @xmath95 of the subsample are quiescent , normal galaxies and the other @xmath96 show signs of disturbed morphologies .",
    "the fraction of disturbed morphologies increases with redshift .",
    "however , only @xmath97 systems out of 36 can be identified positively as interacting systems , while the rest of those with disturbed morphologies could as well be due to instabilities fueled by rapid , asymmetric infall of gas resulting in large clumps of star - forming regions similar to those seen in smmj2135 .",
    "@xcite also observed clumpy , galaxy - wide starbursts in 11 star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 in rest - frame optical wavelengths .",
    "the optical surface brightnesses for their sample are more than an order magnitude greater than for local star - forming galaxies , consistent with our result .    the molecular gas and star formation relation , the kennicutt - schmidt law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , is shown by @xcite to have a slope of 1.1 to 1.2 over a large range of stellar mass surface density ( @xmath98 to @xmath99 m@xmath100pc@xmath101 ) for both low and high - redshift samples .",
    "a remarkable difference between low and high - redshift star - forming galaxies is that the gas depletion time increased from 0.5 gyr at @xmath10 to 1.5 gyr locally @xcite , which is consistent with the picture that star - forming galaxies at low and high - redshift harbor similar star - forming environments but the gas consumption rate , and hence the star formation rate , is significantly higher at high - redshift .",
    "the finding that the physical conditions in high - redshift galaxies star - forming regions are similar to those in local quiescent star - forming galaxies indicates that their intense star formation is unlike the transient starbursting phase due to rapid infall of gas as a result of galaxy interaction , as seen in local ulirgs .",
    "rather they may represent an isolated evolution which could be observable for an extended period of time .",
    "this picture is supported by the behavior of massive star - forming galaxies at high - redshift found in the cosmological simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter simulated populations with observational properties consistent with smgs consists of isolated galaxies in the middle of large potential wells with large gas reservoirs .",
    "it should also be noted that @xcite report a highly asymmetric distribution of gas density , star formation , and velocity field in the simulated smgs consistent with the disturbed morphologies observed .",

    "high - resolution studies of local ulirgs have pointed out their disturbed morphology , double nuclei , and other signs of merger activity .",

    "galaxies from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used to represent normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "sings galaxies are selected from within the local volume to allow ir imaging at reasonably good physical resolution .",
    "we use the 24 @xmath7 images of these galaxies to map star formation .",
    "we only select high - luminosity galaxies . as noted by @xcite , ngc 4125 and ngc 5195 contain seyfert 2 nuclei and thus are excluded from our compilation .  for the other galaxies",
    "was taken from the rbgs except for ngc 1512 , ngc 2841 , and ngc 4625 that are not in the catalog .",
    "for these three galaxies we use 24 @xmath7 fluxes from @xcite to estimate  using the appropriate @xcite sed .",
    "we convolved the sings 24 @xmath7 mips images with a series of gaussians that have angular fwhm corresponding to physical sizes ranging over @xmath107 kpc at the galaxy s distance and then fit 2d gaussians to estimate a deconvolved size from the convolved images .",
    "we found that the recovered fwhm is a slowly varying function of the convolved gaussian s fwhm , which assures that sizes estimated from this method are robust .",
    "for the actual size measurement for these galaxies we convolve all sings 24 @xmath7 imaging with a gaussian that has fwhm corresponding to 4 kpc at each galaxy s distance and measure deconvolved sizes from the convolved image .",
    "this procedure is illustrated by ngc 3627 in fig .",
    "[ local_conv ] .",
    "these sizes are reported in table [ table_local ] for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "our local lirgs were drawn from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "their size measurements are based on the 8.4 ghz vla radio observations , pa@xmath48 imaging using _ hubble _ space telescope ( hst ) , and submillimeter array ( sma ) submillimeter observations , respectively .",
    "@xcite observed 40 lirgs selected from the _ iras _ bright galaxy sample using the vla with a resolution of @xmath110 .",
    "from these 40 lirgs , 15 are dominated by a compact radio component likely to be an agn , referred to by @xcite as `` monsters '' and another 5 are known to harbor agn according to simbad , which we exclude ; 6 are multi - component with one or more components not reported , which we exclude ; 2 are multi - component with well constrained sizes for both components ( ngc 3690 , which is arp 299 for which we adopt co size measurement from @xcite , and iras f15163 + 4255 ) ; one has an observational issue ( ngc 1614 ) but it was also observed by @xcite and therefore we adopt the @xcite size measurement for ngc 1614 ; there are size measurements for only four galaxies of the remaining 11 .",
    "these four are ugc 2369 , iras f03359 + 1523 , ugc 4881 , and iras f17132 + 5313 . along with the aforementioned iras f15163 + 4255 , a multi - component object with well - measured size , we have five lirgs from @xcite .    the @xcite lirgs were selected such that their pa@xmath48 emission line would fall in the narrow band of the f190n filter of the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on _ hst_. the resolution of nicmos ( @xmath111pixel ) resolved detailed structures of these lirgs and thus we need to measure their sizes using the same procedure as in   [ sec : data_local_nsf ] .",
    "however , we convolved the images using gaussians with fwhms corresponding to only 1 kpc at each lirg s distance .",
    "this was necessary because of the intrinsically smaller sizes of the lirgs , which we also tested by measuring the diameter encircling 90% of flux .",
    "the results from our measurements are given in the lirgs section of table [ table_local ] .",
    "@xcite report sizes of lirgs within 200 mpc using the sma , based on co ( @xmath23 ) observations by @xcite .",
    "the sample contains lirgs harboring agn ( including ngc 2623 , ngc 6240 , ugc 5101 , mrk 231 , mrk 273 , iras f10565 + 2448 and iras f17207 - 0014 ) and multicomponent objects where the sizes of some components can not be determined ( including arp 55 , arp 299 , ngc 5331 , and ngc 5257/8 ) and thus we are left with four starburst - dominated objects with good size estimates .",
    "they are arp 193 , vv 114 , ngc 1614 , and iras 10565 .",
    "in total we have 21 lirgs with median  of @xmath112  and a median physical diameter of 0.8 kpc .",
    "this sample is dominated by the 12 galaxies with pa@xmath48 images , and these galaxies by themselves should provide an unbiased estimate of sizes of the star forming regions in lirgs .",
    "the estimated sizes of the galaxies measured in the radio and in co are consistent with those from pa@xmath48 .      despite the many local ulirgs , selecting a sample to study the physical sizes of the starburst regions",
    "is complicated by two issues .",
    "first , a majority of these ulirgs harbor agn and thus do not represent a starburst environment .",
    "second , the sizes of the ir - emitting regions are significantly smaller than the optical and near - ir extents of these galaxies and the existing mid - ir data in the literature ( e.g. sings ) do not resolve the ulirgs ir emission .",
    "our compilation therefore relies on radio and submillimeter interferometric observations of four ulirgs that are known to have their ir luminosity dominated by star - forming emission : vii zw 31 , iras f23365 + 3604 , arp 220 , and iras f17207 - 0014 .",
    "their ir luminosities according to @xcite are in the range of @xmath113 .",
    "arp 220 has two nuclei @xmath114370 pc apart ; the western nucleus is slightly more luminous than the eastern nucleus @xcite .",
    "this galaxy was studied with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at 18 cm by @xcite who found the western nucleus to contain most of the individual 18 cm sources ( 13 sources in the western nucleus vs. three in the eastern nucleus ) .",
    "they report that the sources in the western nucleus are confined within 75 pc @xmath115 pc . circularizing these values",
    "gives a diameter of @xmath116 kpc for the western nucleus alone .",
    "the 1.6 and 5 ghz merlin radio maps by @xcite indicate both nuclei have similar physical sizes .",
    "we estimate the physical size of arp 220 from the 5 ghz map where the two nuclei are clearly separated . combining the emission regions from both nuclei ,",
    "we adopt an effective diameter of 0.2 kpc for the starburst region of arp 220 .",
    "the sizes of vii zw 31 and iras f23365 + 3604 are reported by @xcite based on co ( @xmath21 ) observations ; the iras f17207 - 0014 size by @xcite is based on co ( @xmath23 ) observations .",
    "again , we treat these co - derived sizes as upper limits for the size of the ir - emitting extent of the galaxy .",
