    "early - type dwarfs are often assumed to be lacking in hi gas and star formation .",
    "models often picture their star formation history as a single burst early in the history of the universe . yet",
    "a subset of early - type dwarfs shows signs of relatively recent star formation , as revealed by stellar populations , star formation , and gas content ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , 2007 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of recent star formation in some systems suggests that at least some early - type dwarfs have formed by transitioning from another galaxy class , e.g. , a later - type spiral or dwarf that loses its gas as it enters the hostile environment of a galaxy cluster , or perhaps a gas - poor object accretes gas from another object .",
    "@xcite find that approximately half of the early - type dwarfs in virgo belong to an unrelaxed population that could be associated with recently infalling galaxies .",
    "previous studies have attempted to quantify the the hi gas content of early - type dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but have been limted by small samples and heterogeneous observations .",
    "the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey , a sensitive blind survey of the arecibo sky ( @xcite ) , is providing a complete and unbiased view of hi content and structures in various environments to z=0.06 .",

    "[ [ hi ] ] hi ~~    alfalfa hi detections in the virgo cluster between the declinations of 4 - 16 degrees ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) were compared with the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc : @xcite ; @xcite ) to identify galaxies classified as dwarfs .",
    "a total of 17 or 1.6% of the virgo de / ds0 in this declination range were detected by alfalfa .",
    "four of these are uncertain due to poor signal - to - noise and/or interference from m87 or radio noise .",
    "in contrast , i m and bcd galaxies are detected at a rate of 68% and 79% , respectively .",
    "the hi profiles of the detected de / ds0 are mostly singly - peaked .",
    "most have velocity widths ( uncorrected for inclination ) in the range 30 - 60 .",
    "the median hi mass is 3.5 x 10@xmath5 .",
    "this is 2.2 times smaller than the median hi mass of virgo i m galaxies ( and @xmath62 times the alfalfa detection limit at the virgo distance ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a shows the distribution of detected de / ds0 superposed on the @xcite rosat map of the virgo cluster .",
    "most are located in the cluster outskirts , with several in the direction of the m cloud .",
    "the median distance from m87 of de / ds0 with hi is 4.3@xmath7 ( 1.3 mpc for an assumed virgo distance of 16.7 mpc ) , compared to a median distance of 3.2@xmath7 ( 0.9 mpc ) for the general de / ds0 population .",
    "the de / ds0 with hi are 3 times brighter in the median than the genedominant mechanisms at work will require ral dwarf elliptical population ( 99.8% significance )",
    ". this may be partially due to selection effects , since fainter dwarfs with a similar fraction of hi per unit luminosity would fall under the detection limit for alfalfa at the distance of virgo .",
    "considering only galaxies with @xmath8 , we find that 7% ( 5/71 ) of de / ds0 are detected .",

    "compared to more isolated dwarfs ( not shown ) , we find that virgo dwarfs extend to lower m@xmath9/l@xmath10 .",
    "h@xmath11 images were obtained for 12 early - type dwarfs with hi at the ctio 0.9 m ( smarts ) , the wise observatory 40-inch , the wiyn 0.9 m ( courtesy j. salzer ) , and from the goldmine online database ( @xcite ) .",
    "75% ( 9/12 ) of early - type dwarfs show h@xmath11 emission .",
    "the median equivalent width is about 5 times smaller than the value for i m galaxies . in most cases ,",
    "the emission is centrally concentrated , extending about half as far in the median as that of i m galaxies .",

    "a fourth is a marginal detection by alfalfa requiring followup confirmation ( not counted as a detection in this paper ) .",
    "lisker  ( 2006 , 2007 ) present an extensive study of 413 virgo de / ds0 with @xmath12 , defining sub - types based on morphological features .",
    "we detect 7 of these galaxies in hi .",
    "four are de(bc ) or de with blue center , comprising 17% of the de(bc ) class .",
    "three of these also show h@xmath11 emission .",
    "the other four galaxies in the lisker  sample have four different sub - type classifications .",
    "however , we find no hi detections among galaxies classified as de(di ) , or de with disk feature .",

    "none of the galaxies in their sample is detected in hi by alfalfa .",

    "observations to date reveal that fewer than 2% of virgo de / ds0 dwarfs have hi reserviors .",
    "those that do typically have weak h@xmath11 emission indicating ongoing star formation .",
    "the h@xmath11 morphologies suggest that gas has been preferentially removed from the outer galaxy and/or funneled into the central regions .",
    "virgo dwarfs with hi classified as de / ds0 could be transitional objects , evolving from gas - rich progenitors subjected to cluster environmental effects .",
