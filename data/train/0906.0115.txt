    "the hopfield - tank neural network solution to the travelling salesman problem was a milestone in neuromorphic computation . while the proposed architecture provided a rather poor tsp solution , finding only locally optimal paths for problems of touring more than a few cities , the approach supported the use of more successful",
    " neural \" solutions to simpler problems . in the associative memory problem ,",
    "one simply seeks the closest local optimum ; the issue of avoiding such solutions in favor of a global optimum does not arise .",
    "that a neural solution to the tsp exists at all still speaks to the power of the neuromorphic approach .    in more recent years",
    "the suggestion that the neuronal units of the old - style networks ought to be replaced by oscillating dynamical systems has become popular@xcite .",
    "the oscillations are analogous to spike trains in real neurons .",
    "the resulting cellular neural networks ( cnns ) arguably resemble biological systems more closely than their older counterparts , in which a  neuron \" exists in a fixed state and outputs a pre - defined , approximately binary function of a collection of inputs .",
    "attempts to capture the properties of biological systems in simple models , such as the grossberg - mingolla model of early vision@xcite , indeed depend on neuronal dynamics .",
    "further , in the realm of practical application , cnn architectures lend themselves to implementation in analog hardware .",
    "a cnn generalization of the hopfield associative memory network has recently been proposed@xcite .",
    "some effort was required to stabilize the desired retrieval state , as compared to the original hopfield network .",
    "the resulting network performed almost as well as its fixed - state counterpart , a finding that was taken to imply a broad utility for the cnn paradigm .",
    "relationships between oscillating ",
    "cellular \" neurons offer richer possibilities for representation of solutions and of intermediate computational steps .",
    "synchronization of two or more neurons ( i.e. phase - locking ) was the defining relationship in the proposed cnn associative memory architecture .",
    "more generally , synchronization offers a representation of binding that may be useful for image segmentation and other combinatorial problems@xcite .",
    "such applications are in line with the suggested role of synchronization in perceptual grouping in biological systems@xcite .",
    "we show here that synchronization in a cnn provides a particularly natural representation of the tsp , yielding a solution that generalizes the older hopfield method . in future work",
    ", we will examine the use of synchronization , as an intrinsically loose form of binding , to avoid the problem of local optima .",
    "we first summarize the original hopfield solution in the next section , and then describe the cnn generalization in section 3 .",
    "results are presented in section 4 , where the essential role of stochasticity in a simulated annealing scheme is also demonstrated .",
    "the stochastic version leads to a suggestion in the concluding section that the instability that was seen as an obstacle to the design of cnn s for associative memory may be beneficial in cnn s designed for optimization .",
    "the hopfield - tank network is a traditional neural network , fully interconnected , with fixed weights chosen so that the globally optimal state corresponds to a shortest - distance  tour \" among a collection of @xmath0 cities with a pre - specified distance for each pair of cities . in this original representation ,",
    "one considers an @xmath1 matrix of binary values , where the rows correspond to cities and the columns correspond to slots , 1 through @xmath0 , in the tour schedule .",
    "a tour is any pattern of 0 s and 1 s , such that there is exacly one 1 in each row ( exactly one city visited at a time ) and one 1 in each column ( each city visited exactly once ) .",
    "for instance the tour depicted in fig .",
    "[ fighopf]a is ecabd . for the 5-city problem ,",
    "there is a 10-fold degeneracy in optimal patterns ( shortest - distance cyclic tours ) due to arbitrariness in the selection of the starting city and the direction of the tour .",
    "the travelling salesman problem , in this representation or any other , is difficult because of the multiplicity of local optima .",
    "the hopfield and tank network converges in a few neural time constants for small @xmath0 , but the required time grows rapidly with @xmath0 and sub - optimal solutions are typically found .",
    "the nonlinear response function of each unit is key to the operation of the network .",
    "flexibility comes from embedding a discrete problem in a continuous decision space .",
    "that is , each unit @xmath2 generates a nearly , but not quite binary output as a sigmoid function @xmath3 of a continuous valued input @xmath4 .",
    "consider a general , fully interconnected network of @xmath5 units ( here @xmath6 ) , where each unit is updated according to : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a symmetric matrix defining the connections among the units in the network , the @xmath9 are biases , and @xmath10 is a decay time .",
    "it can be shown that an energy function @xmath11 is locally minimized , by computing the time derivative @xmath12 and noting that the resulting form is negative semi - definite and that @xmath13 is bounded below . in the limit of high gain ( small @xmath14 ) , for which the sigmoid function is infinitely steep , the minima only occur when each @xmath15 is @xmath16 or @xmath17 , i.e. at the corners of the @xmath5-dimensional hypercube @xmath18^n$ ] that is the state space of the network described in terms of the variables @xmath15 .",
    "the class of optimization problems that can be formulated in this manner is quite large , as illustrated by the travelling salesman problem , which is _ a priori _ different in form .",
    "the tsp energy is @xmath19   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac { d}{2 } \\sum_x \\sum_{y\\ne x } \\sum_i d_{xy } v_{xi}(v_{y , i+1}+v_{y , i-1})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 range over the @xmath0 cities , and the indices @xmath2 and @xmath22 range over the @xmath0 slots in the schedule .",
    "the first term in ( [ tspenergy ] ) inhibits multiple 1 s in each row , the second term inhibits multiple 1 s in each column , the third term tends to force the total number of 1 s in the matrix to be exactly @xmath0 , and the last term minimizes the total distance associated with any pattern of 0 s and 1 s that defines a valid tour .",
    "the network method of optimization succeeds largely because difficult decisions between similar tours can effectively be postponed until the end of a calculation . in the interim ,",
    "non - tour patterns ( corresponding to multiple visits to a city or visits to more than one city at a time ) can be regarded as representing alternative choices simultaneously .",
    "choices can thus be winowed incrementally toward a true optimum .",
    "nonetheless , the network tends to converge to local optima , rather than the global optimum , especially as @xmath0 becomes large .",
    "it was found that global optimization performance could be greatly improved by a",
    " simulated annealing \" technique in which a stochastic component of gradually decreasing amplitude is added to the dynamics . in the original hopfield annealing scheme , the variables @xmath15 were reinterpreted as expectation values of a statistical distribution of  spin states \" , and a lowering of  temperature \" was effected by increasing the  gain \" in the sigmoid function that determines @xmath15 , i.e. decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "the stochastic component can also be represented directly as a noise term in the dynamical equations .",
    "\\a ) + b )    the representation considered here is an @xmath23 array of coupled periodic oscillators .",
    "a tour is specified by a synchronization pattern in which all oscillators in each row and each column are desynchronized , and such that for each oscillator in each column ( row ) , there is exactly one oscillator in each other column ( row ) that is synchronized with it . in fig .",
    "[ fighopf]b , the same tour ecabd is depicted in the new representation , simultaneously with equivalant tours given by cyclic permutations of cities : cabde , abdec , etc .",
    "there is now only a two - fold degeneracy in optimal patterns , due to arbitrariness in direction .    to solve the travelling salesman problem in the representation we have described ,",
    "let each oscillator be given by a complex number @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) that contains both a phase @xmath26 and an amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "assume all oscillators have the same frequency @xmath28 and make the replacement @xmath29 , so that only the relative phases are represented in the complex quantities @xmath24 .",
    "the lyapunov function we seek to minimize is : @xmath30 where asterisks denote complex conjugates , and we close the tours by defining @xmath31 .",
    "the first term , with coefficient @xmath32 , tends to force @xmath33 .",
    "the second term , with coefficient @xmath34 tends to force each @xmath24 to one of @xmath0 phase states , corresponding to the @xmath0th roots of unity .",
    "the terms with coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 penalize for synchronization within each row and within each column , respectively . the last term , expressed in terms of distances @xmath37 between cities",

    "if the oscillators are governed by equations @xmath44 following hoppensteadt@xcite , then the derivative of the lyapunov function @xmath45             = -2 \\sum_{ij } |\\dot z_{ij}|^2 \\le 0 $ ] , so that the cost function is monotonically decreasing and must reach at least a local minimum , since @xmath46 can be easily seen to be bounded below .    for sufficiently large @xmath34 ,",
    "the units are each forced to one of the @xmath0 allowed phase states . for the restricted configurations thus defined , it is easily seen that the sum of the terms in ( [ hopl ] ) with coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 is minimized when the @xmath0 phases in any column or any row are all different .",
    "such configurations define a set of @xmath0 tours , some or all of which may be equivalent via cyclic permutation .",
    "each such tour @xmath47 defines a set of units with the same relative phases , giving a contribution to the distance term in ( [ hopl ] ) equal to @xmath48 since @xmath49 for synchronized units .",
    "each of the @xmath0 such contributions is minimized when each tour length @xmath50 is minimized .",
    "additional contributions from cross terms between desynchronized units can be neglected in a stationary phase approximation .",
    "coefficients @xmath51 can then be chosen so that the various optimization criteria , forcing select phase states , forcing tour configurations , and minimizing distance , can indeed be satisfied simultaneously . a formal proof is given in appendix a.",
