    "@xmath0al is an important radionuclide for tracing and studying galactic radioactivity .",
    "@xmath0al - the isotope of @xmath3al - is unstable with a mean life of @xmath4@xmath5 = 1.05x10@xmath6 years and decays to @xmath0 mg emitting a gamma ray photon of 1.809 mev .",
    "it is through the detection of this 1.8 mev @xmath7 ray photon that @xmath0al manifests itself .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0al towards the galactic center - deemed to be epochal in nature - was made by the high energy astronomical observatory ( heao - c ) in 1979 - 80 ( mahoney et al .",
    "1982 ) and subsequently confirmed by a few other missions ( prantzos @xmath8 diehl 1996 ) .",
    "however , these missions were limited by inadequate spatial resolution ( typically a few tens of degrees ) and could not therefore locate the precise sites of the 1.8 mev @xmath7 ray emission . a major advance in mapping the 1.8 mev @xmath7 ray emission from the galaxy emerged from recent studies by the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) ( diehl et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the cgro mapping at 1.8 mev - obtained at a vastly improved resolution ( telescope angular response is @xmath9 3.8 degrees ) but which is still below that required for a precise point source association - traces @xmath0al emission in localized regions lying mostly along the galactic plane . a diffuse and irregular emission along the galactic plane",
    "is observed favoring a massive star origin .",
    "supernovae , novae , wolf rayet stars and agb ( asymptotic giant branch ) stars are considered the prime candidates for the origin of the 1.8 mev emission but this has to be established more firmly .",
    "hence a convincing detection of @xmath0al in any of these class of objects would give more definite evidence on the exact sites of @xmath0al production .",
    "further , a detection of @xmath0al would have important implications for current models of nucleosynthesis .",
    "such models give estimates - which are believed to be uncertain - of the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio that can be expected in the different classes of @xmath0al producing sources . an observational constraint on the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio",
    "would therefore be vitally important for nucleosynthesis modeling .",
    "the efforts from cgro are being extended by the gamma ray satellite integral which has high - resolution gamma ray spectroscopy as one of its main goals .",
    "thus the study of the origin and distribution of @xmath0al in the galaxy , though in a nascent stage , is assuming significant importance .",
    "it may also be mentioned that @xmath0al plays an important role in solar system studies where its decay to @xmath0 mg is invoked to explain the excess @xmath0 mg found in meteoritic samples ( the @xmath0 mg anomaly ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the @xmath0al and several other short - lived nuclides present in the early solar system were freshly synthesized nuclides injected into the proto - solar cloud from a nearby source such as a nova / supernova / agb star ( cameron et al .",
    "1995 ; arnould et al .",
    "1997 ; goswami @xmath8 vanhala 1998 ) .",
    "alternatively , the possibility of energetic - particle interactions - as a source of @xmath0al production - has also been proposed ( gounelle et al . 2001 ) .    the possibility of a first , spatially - resolved and alternate method of detecting @xmath0al ( apart from detecting the 1.8 mev line ) in an astronomical object suggested itself when several strong a - x bands of the alo radical were detected in v4332 sgr ( banerjee et al .",
    "2003 ) . by virtue of having undergone a nova - like outburst",
    ", v4332 sgr satisfied the requisite criterion of belonging to a class of objects predicted to be a likely site of @xmath0al creation .",
    "it was also recognized that molecular bands , arising from different isotopic compositions , can be easily resolved spectroscopically at an intermediate resolution .",
    "this is not the case for atomic lines where the isotope shifts are too small to detect .",
    "a frequently encountered example , of isotopically differing molecular bands being resolved , arises in the first overtone bands of carbon monoxide at 2.3@xmath10 m . here",
    ", the signatures of the @xmath1co and @xmath2co bands are routinely seen to be distinctly separate in the spectra of cool stars .",
    "we thus felt that the two components of alo viz .",
    "the radioactive component @xmath0alo ( in case it is present at detectable limits ) and the stable component @xmath3alo could be expected to be distinctly resolved in v4332 sgr .",
    "considering that al bearing molecules are seen very rarely in astronomical sources , v4332 sgr presented a unique chance to detect the presence of @xmath0al .",
    "further , since the alo bands in v4332 sgr are strong , even a low strength of @xmath0al vis - a - vis @xmath3al in the object would still permit the @xmath0alo bands to be detected .",
    "the detected strength of the putative @xmath0alo bands would help to establish the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio in the source . while all the a - x bands of alo are expected to exhibit the @xmath0alo component , the ( 2,0 ) band",
    "was chosen for the present study because it is strong and the adjacent spectral region around the wings of the band - where the @xmath0alo signature is expected - is relatively uncontaminated with other features .",
    "further , the wavelength separation between the @xmath0alo and @xmath3alo components of the ( 2,0 ) band is larger than that for many of the other bands and therefore expected to be more easily resolved .",
    "specifically , the expected band - origin for the @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 components for @xmath3alo and @xmath0alo are at 1.50351@xmath10 m and 1.50155@xmath10 m respectively ( a separation of 19.6 ) ; for the @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath15 component the positions are at 1.47492@xmath10 m and 1.47325@xmath10 m ( a separation of 16.7 ) respectively .",
    "such separations can be resolved at a spectral resolution of 1000 or higher ( we have used a resolution of 3800 in our observations ) .",
    "it was also felt that the present study could give additional insights into the outburst mechanism for v4322 sgr .",
    "v4332 sgr is intrinsically a very interesting source having a rich optical and near - ir spectrum ( banerjee et al .",
    "2003 ; banerjee @xmath8 ashok 2004 ) .",
    "it erupted in 1994 with a @xmath9 9.5 magnitude brightening in the @xmath16 band followed by a slow decline .",
    "the distance to the object has been estimated to be 300 pc ( martini et al .",
    "the puzzling aspect of the object was its rapid cooling to a m giant / supergiant which was uncharacteristic of a classical nova ( martini et al . 1999 ) .",
    "classical novae generally evolve towards the hot nebular / coronal state .",
    "a similar behavior of evolving towards cool temperatures like v4332 sgr , has been seen recently in the spectacular outburst the eruptive variable v838 mon ( munari et al .",
    "2002 ; banerjee @xmath8 ashok , 2002a ; bond et al .",
    "2003 - for the striking light echo around the object ) .",
    "it has been suggested that v838 mon , v4332 sgr and m31 rv ( another red variable that erupted in m31 ; rich et al .",
    "1989 ) could belong to a new class of objects with outburst properties significantly different from those of conventional eruptive variables like classical , symbiotic , recurrent novae or born again agb stars ( munari et al .",
    "there is an imperative need to understand the cause of the explosion in such eruptive variables .",
    "plausible explanations for the outburst invoke merger of stars ( soker @xmath8 tylenda 2003 ) and a star capturing its encircling planets ( retter @xmath8 marom 2003 ) .",
    "the conventional scenario for outbursts in classical novae - that of a thermonuclear runaway on a white dwarf surface accreting matter from its secondary companion - does not appear to hold ( bond et al .",
    "2003 ) but a variant of it may be applicable to v4332 sgr given the uniqueness of the object . since in a classical novae outburst ,",
    "theoretical estimates indicate that the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio can be significantly enhanced to values even exceeding unity , ( gehrz et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ; jose @xmath8 hernanz 1998 ; prantzos @xmath8 diehl 1996 ) the detected strength of @xmath0al relative to @xmath3al in v4332 sgr could shed further light on the progenitor of v4332 sgr which underwent the outburst .",
    "@xmath17 band spectra were obtained on 22 september 2003 with the 3.8 m united kingdom ir telescope ( ukirt ) , hawaii and the 1 - 5 micron imager spectrometer ( uist ) using a 1024@xmath181024 insb array .",
    "observations were done by nodding the telescope on two positions separated by @xmath9 12@xmath19 along a 2 pixel ( 0.24@xmath19 ) wide slit resulting in a spectral resolution of 3800 .",
    "flat fielding was done with a black body mounted inside uist and spectral calibration was done using an argon lamp .",
    "the standard star bs 6998 was observed at similar air - mass as v4332 sgr and its spectrum was used for ratioing the object spectra for removal of telluric lines .",
    "table 1 gives the details of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the observed spectra in the two dithered positions are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we show these spectra separately to bring out the genuineness and repeatability of several finer features that are evident in the bands .",
    "the spectra here may be compared with the lower - resolution spectrum ( r = 450 ) of the same bands as given in banerjee at al .",
    "( 2003 ) - more detail is discernible in the present spectra .",
    "the alo bands described here arise from transitions between the a - x electronic states of the alo radical ( launila @xmath8 jonsson 1994 ) .",
    "the a state is a doublet with the spin components @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath15 .",
    "the observed spectrum here is typical of electronic - vibration transitions in diatomic molecules ( herzberg 1950 ) .",
    "the fine structure seen in the spectra arise from the rotational lines of the p , q and r branches .",
    "the r branch is manifested most clearly since it gives rise to the prominent band - head ( blueward of the band origin and marked in figure 1 ) where the r branch lines crowd together .",
    "the actual structure of the the r band - head is complex as it consists of two or more branches ( launila @xmath8 jonsson 1994 ) .",
    "it is around this position of the r branch band - head that the contribution of @xmath0alo bands is expected to be seen . since hints of an additional component",
    "were seen at around this position in our earlier data , we felt that it could be a tentative signature for @xmath0alo .",
    "specifically we refer to the @xmath20 band spectrum for the @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath15 component of the ( 4,0 ) band which shows a sloping blue wing at 1.2256@xmath10 m ( banerjee at al .",
    "2003 ; the blue wings of all the other alo bands rise sharply - typical of molecular band structure ) . a similar @xmath20 band spectrum for the ( 4,0 ) band taken at a higher resolution of 2050 , but not included in banerjee et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , decomposes the sloping blue wing into two distinct components .",
    "thus , it was felt that the potential existed to try and make a more detailed search for @xmath0alo in v4332 sgr .",
    "because of the good reproducibility in the two spectra of figure 1 , we have averaged them to increase the s / n and the resultant spectrum is shown in figure 2 ( top panel ) by the grey line .",
    "a computed model spectrum for alo - assuming a pure @xmath3alo component and no @xmath0alo - for the ( 2,0 ) band for a rotational temperature of 200k is overlaid on this . as may be seen , there is a good match between the model and the observed data . the broader features , like the excellent wavelength matching of the r branch band - head and the overall band structure are well reproduced .",
    "in addition , many of the finer features due to the individual rotational transitions are well matched .",
    "the observed alo spectrum of v4332 sgr appears to be quite pure . however , there is a broad observed feature at 1.526@xmath10 m - marked with an asterisk - which does not match the model spectrum and which appears to be due to some other species apart from alo .",
    "the synthetic alo spectra were created starting from the known molecular constants of both states involved in the transition of the experimentally known @xmath3alo isotopomer .",
    "corrections were subsequently applied on all these constants , according to standard procedures for isotopic corrections , and corresponding @xmath0alo spectra were generated using a synthesis routine for molecular spectra ( available at http://kurslab.physics.kth.se/  olli / superb/ ) .    in the lower panel of figure 2 , we show four plots which indicate how the model spectrum for pure @xmath3alo would be affected by including an @xmath0alo component .",
    "the fractional contribution of @xmath0al in each plot is indicated in terms of the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio used to construct each curve . to avoid crowding",
    ", we do not show the pure @xmath0alo spectrum - it has a structure essentially similar to the @xmath3alo spectrum but laterally shifted to a slightly shorter wavelength ( the relative displacements of the band origin are 19.6 and 16.7 for the ( 2,0 ) doublets respectively ) . from the plots of the lower panel of figure 2",
    ", it is seen that the most distinctive signature for the presence of @xmath0alo would be its r branch band - head labeled as feature c. at higher values of the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio ( 0.3,0.5 and 1 ) it is predicted to be strong . even at a value as low as 0.1 , this feature is discernible in the computed plots for the @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath15 components .",
    "hence there should have been some sign of it in the observed spectra if @xmath0al was present at significant strength in v4332 sgr .",
    "the intensity of the feature b with respect to a , also increases with increasing values of the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio . the ratio of these two features in the observed spectra would appear to be best replicated for a @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio of 0.1 or lower .",
    "thus , it would appear that @xmath0al is not seen at appreciable strength in v4332 sgr . to get a more rigorous estimate on the upper limit on the strength of @xmath0al , we applied a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to the observed and model data ( for different @xmath0al/@xmath3al values ) .",
    "the ks test was applied to a restricted portion of the data between 1.47@xmath10 m to 1.48@xmath10 m .",
    "this section of data was chosen because the strength of features a , b and c are expected to be considerably influenced by the presence of @xmath0al .",
    "the ks test , in this region , should therefore be sensitive to the signature of @xmath0al . from the analysis we find a high probability of association ( p ) between the model and observed data when @xmath0al is not present ( i.e. p = 0.91 for @xmath0al/@xmath3al = 0 ) . as the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio is increased to values of 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.15 and 0.20 respectively",
    ", p falls to values of 0.80 , 0.20 , 0.033 and 0.001 respectively .",
    "the computed probability values indicate that @xmath0al is definitely not present at large strengths of 15 - 20 percent",
    ". an upper limit of @xmath9 10 percent is suggested based on the analysis .",
    "the present data do not permit setting a lower limit on the strength of @xmath0al in v4332 sgr .",
    "spectra obtained at a higher resolution than the present studies - and at similar or greater s / n - where the individual rotational lines are better resolved could give a more definite answer .",
    "a positive detection of @xmath0al would have constituted definite observational confirmation of the theoretical prediction that novae explosions synthesize @xmath0al .",
    "even otherwise , the fairly reliable limit of the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio that we obtain has important implications .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0al in novae and other @xmath0al producing sources is a very complex field .",
    "it is recognized that considerable uncertainty exists in crucial areas related to nuclear reaction networks and nuclear reaction rates thereby leading to uncertainties in the predicted value of the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio for the different sources ( prantzos @xmath8 diehl 1996 ; gehrz et al . 1998 ; busso , gallino @xmath8 wasserburg 1999 ) . as an example",
    "we note that the reaction rates for the key reactions for the production and destruction of @xmath0al viz . @xmath21mg(p,@xmath7)@xmath0al and @xmath0al(p,@xmath7)@xmath3si ( proton capture on @xmath21 mg and @xmath0al )",
    "have been revised by a factor of 5 in recent times ( prantzos @xmath8 diehl 1996 ) .",
    "there are additional uncertainties involving the treatment of convection in novae .",
    "an observational constraint on the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio would therefore be extremely important for nucleosynthesis models .",
    "the predicted model values for this ratio for classical novae are as follows .",
    "for co novae ( the outburst occurs on a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) with m@xmath22 @xmath23 1.2m@xmath24 ) , the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio depends strongly on the wd mass .",
    "for wd masses between 0.6 to 1.2m@xmath24 , the recent results of starrfield et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that this ratio varies between 0.01 to 0.6 . for the onemg novae ( which comprise @xmath9 30 - 40 percent of all classical novae ) the wd is more massive",
    "( @xmath25 1.2m@xmath24 ) and a much greater ratio for @xmath0al/@xmath3al between 1 - 10 can be expected ( starrfield et al . 1997 ; prantzos @xmath8 diehl 1996 ) . the detailed nucleosynthesis models by jose @xmath8 hernanz ( 1998 ) indicate that the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio can lie between 0.2 - 0.4 for one novae and between 0.15 - 0.56 for co novae",
    ". the increased yield of @xmath0al in onemg novae is essentially due to the existing magnesium rich environment in the outbursting progenitors in these objects ( @xmath26 mg and @xmath21 mg are the seed nuclei for @xmath0al generation ) .",
    "as can be seen a significant value of the @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio can be expected in novae .",
    "novae are estimated to contribute 0.1 to 0.4m@xmath24 ( jose , hernanz @xmath8 coc 1997 ) of the approximately 2m@xmath24 of @xmath0al present in the galaxy ( a value based on the heao - c and cgro results ) .",
    "while v4332 sgr is not a typical novae , and the predicted @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio for classical novae can not be strictly extrapolated here , it must still be noted that it underwent a single large outburst like a classical nova .",
    "it would be useful to mention the expected @xmath0al/@xmath3al ratio in some of the other potential @xmath0al producing candidates . in wolf rayet",
    "stars this ratio is 2 - 5x10@xmath27 and in type ii supernovae it is 5 - 7x10@xmath28 . in agb stars",
    ", it is expected to be a few times 10@xmath28 if @xmath0al is produced only in the hydrogen burning shell .",
    "this ratio is uncertain , but can be larger than unity , in case hot bottom burning is also considered ( prantzos @xmath8 diehl 1996 ) . for v4332 sgr specifically , the lack of @xmath0al at appreciable strength , indicates that its progenitor is unlikely to be a onemg white dwarf . as mentioned earlier , there is keen interest in understanding the nature of the progenitor and the outburst mechanism for this object and its probable analog v838 mon .",
    "the present results give additional insights in this direction .",
    "it may also be noted that @xmath29na ( mean life @xmath9 3.75 years ) is another important radioisotope whose production is expected to be significantly enhanced in nova outbursts ( starrfield et al .",
    "1997 , gehrz et al .",
    "emission lines from the resonance doublet of nai at 5890 , 5896 have been detected with considerable strength in v4332 sgr ( banerjee @xmath8 ashok 2004 ) .",
    "if a significant fraction of the observed nai emission is from @xmath29na , then because of its short mean life , a considerable reduction in the intensity of the nai doublet can be expected ( vis - vis other emission lines seen in the spectrum ) over a timescale of a few years . the object should be monitored to detect such changes .",
    "@xmath29na is also of interest for @xmath7 ray line study by integral because of the 1.275 mev photon emitted by its decay to @xmath29ne .",
