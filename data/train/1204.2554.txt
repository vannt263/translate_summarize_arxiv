    "the exact value of the cube dimension though does not affect our main results .",
    "a cube size in the range @xmath101 gives similar results , but the lower bound is too close to the edges of the ionized region , while larger boxes would have lower spatial resolution at fixed grid size , which is undesirable .    once the cube is extracted , the gas density and velocity fields are gridded as input for crash@xmath0 . for gridding , we use gadgettogrid @xcite .",
    "the code distributes the particle mass and peculiar velocities using an sph kernel to 64 neighboring particles and then grids the fields .",
    "the default grid size used is 256@xmath102 , which is set by memory and runtime constraints of crash@xmath0 , although different grid sizes have been used for testing purposes .",
    "an important caveat is that , because the grid resolution is a factor of the virial radius of the halo , this results in a lower physical resolution for higher mass objects .    figure  [ fig : slicecube ] shows a slice through the simulation box .",

    "note that the gas density in the igm is not uniform and the gridded density field has a range in values spanning many orders of magnitude .          as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "we obtain the halo properties using the fof and use the associated imf , stellar mass and metallicity to calculate the corresponding ionizing and ly@xmath0 photon rate . to this purpose , we use starburst99 @xcite , which is a population synthesis code that provides the spectrum of a stellar population given an imf , stellar mass , metallicity and age .",
    "the lowest metallicity available in starburst99 is @xmath103 for padova tracks .",
    "we choose the padova original stellar evolution tracks instead of padova agb tracks as the hubble age at @xmath1 is less than @xmath104 gyr , allowing us to ignore the contribution of agb stars to the spectrum .",
    "the average ionizing flux for the same stellar mass is mildly higher for lower metallicities , i.e.  @xmath105 higher for @xmath106 ( refer to @xcite for low metallicity values ) . since our metallicities are above @xmath45 , we use a salpeter imf in the mass range [ 0.1,100 ] @xmath49 in the starburst99 models , consistently with our cosmological simulations .",

    "for example , @xcite uses the imf mass range of [ 1,100 ] @xmath49 rather than [ 0.1,100 ] @xmath49 employed in our simulations .",

    "the igm ionization level is determined by a combination of a background radiation and local sources .",
    "here we study how these two contributions change the observability of our test source .      to understand the effect of the igm ionization level on the ly@xmath0 rt , we repeat the reference simulation with an initial volume averaged ionization fraction of @xmath229 and 0.89 .",
    "the first value corresponds to an epoch when only half of the igm is ionized , while the second is the value obtained from the reionization model @xmath2301.2-@xmath01.8 described in @xcite , which is designed to be consistent with existing observational constraints such as the thomson scattering optical depth and the photo - ionization rate at @xmath231 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ionfracstruct ] shows a slice cut through the ionization structure at the end of the simulation for the three cases described above . as expected , the higher @xmath219 is , the larger is the fully ionized region produced by the source , although the differences are not dramatic because the high density filaments surrounding the source effectively confine the fully ionized region in all cases and determine its shape .",
    "note that while the edges of the ionized region are controlled by the high density filaments in the igm , the inclusion of ionizing flux from galaxies in those high density clumps could lead to a different ionization structure ( as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] ) .    as a larger ionized region results in less scatter for the ly@xmath0 photons",
    ", we expect an easier escape in this case .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : ionfrac ] , where the spectrum of all the ly@xmath0 photons exiting the simulation box is plotted .",
    "due to the lower number of scatterings undergone by the ly@xmath0 photons for higher values of @xmath219 , the peak shifts to bluer wavelengths and the photon count at the peak increases while reducing the width of the line profile .",
    "the sb maps for one of the sides of the box for the different @xmath219 values is shown in figure [ fig : ionfracsb ] .",
    "as @xmath219 increases , the sb profile becomes more concentrated while improving detectability .",
    "from the maps , we can infer that observations at @xmath175 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 would appear as a point source to the observer . for this viewing direction , the luminosity ( effective escape fraction ) of the point source detected for @xmath229 and 0.89 is @xmath232 erg  s@xmath6 ( 0.001 ) and @xmath233 erg  s@xmath6 ( 0.04 ) , respectively , compared to a non detection at @xmath234 .",
    "more specifically , if we were to consider the maps from all six faces of the cube , at @xmath235 the object would be detected as a point source from all the six directions with @xmath236 in the range @xmath237 , compared to only two detections as point source in six maps at @xmath234 with @xmath238 and 0.09 .",
    "thus at high ionization fractions most of the objects can be detected as point sources at lower sb thresholds compared to our reference case .",
    "our results appear similar to @xcite who find that even at a mean neutral fraction of 10@xmath239 , only a small fraction of the photons ( 8 - 33 @xmath195 of the intrinsic luminosity ) escape as a point source .",
    "because this paper is primarily focused on the effect of the igm in the immediate surroundings of a source of ly@xmath0 photons , we do not follow the propagation of the photons to the observer . to do so",
    ", we would need much larger boxes , losing the resolution necessary to properly account for the scales we are mainly interested in here .",
    "nevertheless , the igm outside our simulation box is bound to scatter the photons in an amount dependent on their frequency when they escape the box .",
    "the optical depth @xmath11 due to scattering away from the line - of - sight to the observer ( at @xmath12 ) for a lae at @xmath145 is given in equations  [ eqn : tau1 ] and  [ eqn : tau2 ] .",
    "for @xmath240 at @xmath150 , the optical depth @xmath241 for @xmath242 , corresponding to a comoving distance of @xmath243 from the source which is much larger than our cube sizes . beyond this distance from the source",
    "the ly@xmath0 photons have redshifted far enough from resonance such that the neutral igm does not further affect the ly@xmath0 sb profiles .",
    "however , in some cases analyzed in this work  in particular low mass objects for which smaller boxes are extracted  the photons emitted by the source do not redshift far from the line resonance when they reach the edge of the box .",
    "the neutral gas outside the box can then further modify the predicted ly@xmath0 sb profile .    as a simple estimate of the scattering in neutral gas beyond the boundaries of the cube we can use equation  [ eqn : tau2 ] .",
    "the effect of this scattering on the spectra of photons escaping the box for our test object is shown in figure  [ fig : suppxion ] . for @xmath234 , the @xmath11",
    "integrated over the whole spectrum is 2.9 , but as the ionization increases , the @xmath11 decreases to 1.8 at @xmath229 and to 0.55 at @xmath235 , leading to more photons being observed .",
    "the scattering beyond the cube can therefore be significant for small @xmath219 , resulting in lower sb values per pixel extending over a larger angular size .",
    "even deeper sb cuts would then be required to observe the total luminosity of the object .",
    "in contrast , for high @xmath219 scattering beyond the cube can be safely ignored , and the sb profile would retain the point source like appearance seen in figure  [ fig : ionfracsb ] .",
    "the qualitative results described in the previous sections ( e.g. a spread and increment in @xmath244 for lower @xmath4 ) would still hold .",
    "another factor which reduces scattering outside the simulation box is the velocity shift discussed in section  [ sec : velshift ] . a shift of 200 ( 400 ) km  s@xmath6 reduces the effective @xmath11 to 2.8 ( 2.3 ) even for @xmath234 .",
    "this implies that the predicted steepening of the sb profiles with @xmath219 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : reionhistory ] below ) and velocity off - set are ( conservatively ) underestimated by our calculations .",
    "we point out that constraints on the reionization history that are provided by current observations of the ly@xmath0 forest and the cosmic microwave background , as well as theoretical investigations , suggest that the ionization fraction at @xmath245 was mostly complete ( i.e. well in excess of @xmath246 ; see e.g. fig .  11 of @xcite or fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "this suggest that for realistic constraints on @xmath219 at @xmath1 the scatter beyond the cube is not significant , and so we do not include this extra scatter in the rest of our analysis .      while a roughly uniform ionization fraction could be induced by an ionizing background , photons from neighboring haloes clustered around a source would induce further fluctuations in the gas ionization structure . to investigate the impact this has on our reference simulation , we propagate ionizing photons from all the stellar sources present in the cube ( referred to as case @xmath247 for clustering ) , rather than only from the central source .",
    "figure  [ fig : clusterion ] shows a slice through the ionization structure obtained in case @xmath247 ( middle panel ) along with that from the reference simulation ( left panel ) . as expected , the ionization bubble around the object is much larger and complex when the effect of all the sources is considered . in case @xmath247 ,",
    "the final value for the volume averaged ionization fraction is @xmath248 , compared to 0.047 of the reference case .    to understand how the ionization structure due to clustered sources affects the propagation of ly@xmath0 photons compared to a uniform ionization , we do another test run ( referred to as case @xmath249 for uniform ) producing the same final volume averaged ionization fraction of case @xmath247 , i.e. 0.340 , but this is induced by photons emitted only from the central source embedded in a gas with a uniform initial ionization fraction of 0.293 .",
    "case @xmath249 is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : clusterion ] and exhibits a very different ionization structure compared to case @xmath247 .",
    "while the region with fully ionized gas is smaller in case @xmath249 , the situation is reversed in the region beyond the bubble with some fully neutral gas still present in case @xmath247 .",
    "note that in all cases the ly@xmath0 photons are emitted only by the central source .",
    "figure  [ fig : clustersb ] shows the sb maps for the three cases discussed above ( for the top right panel in fig .  [ fig : run1sb ] ) . both case",
    "@xmath247 and case @xmath249 show a more concentrated sb profile compared to the reference run as expected for a lower @xmath219 , but the details in the sb maps differ due to the distribution of neutral gas . in particular , all the maps ( from the six faces of the cube ) of case @xmath249 have a more concentrated structure compared to case @xmath247 due to the higher ionization level of the gas outside the fully ionized bubble .",
    "in fact , since the ionization bubble is not large enough for the ly@xmath0 photons to be redshifted out of resonance when they reach its border , the neutral gas distribution beyond it is particularly important for the determination of the corresponding sb maps . because the concentration in the sb improves detectability , case @xmath249",
    "is expected to favor observations of laes . at @xmath181",
    "erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 , case @xmath247 has @xmath250 , while case @xmath249 has @xmath251 , compared to the reference case of @xmath252 .",
    "it might seem that clustering of neighbouring sources does not substantially change the observability of the lae , but because the flux is redistributed in different directions due to the different ionization structure in the igm , @xmath236 can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the observing direction .",
    "for the same @xmath4 , another direction ( top right panel in fig .  [ fig : run1sb ] ) has @xmath253 , 0.7 and 0.6 for case @xmath247 , case @xmath249 and the reference case , respectively . for reference ,",
    "the input luminosity is @xmath172 erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "thus it should be kept in mind that even though both neighbouring sources and uniform background flux improves detectability of laes by increasing the mean ionization fraction of igm in the region , the detailed ionization structure around a source plays a crucial role in determining the sb profiles in different directions .",
    "keeping in mind the discussions in the previous sections , we now turn to study how structure in the igm affects the methods which use the sb profiles of laes to estimate the mean ionization fraction of the universe .",
    "one of the most popular methods is to calculate the luminosity function of laes and determine its redshift evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using analytic models to describe the reionization history , the above authors estimate the evolution of @xmath11 ( employing equations similar to eq .",
    "[ eqn : tau2 ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic lf of laes is then calculated from halo mass functions , assuming that the luminosity of an object is proportional to its mass and that it is attenuated by @xmath254 due igm absorption / scattering .",
    "a comparison with the observed lf provides a constraint on the actual @xmath11 and thus on the gas neutral fraction in the igm .",
    "but these methods rely on the assumption that observations of laes obtain the total flux from the source detected as a point source .",
    "some recent observations though have detected faint extended sb profiles @xcite , as produced in our simulations . as we have seen , the probability of detection of a lae strongly depends on @xmath4 , especially for low @xmath219 . here",
    "we investigate how a different choice of @xmath4 affects the lae lfs for different values of @xmath219 , aiming at a qualitative assessment , while a more detailed and quantitative comparison to observations is part of a future study .",
    "we model the 45 most massive objects in l05 using @xmath219=0 , 0.5 and 0.89 as described in section  [ sec : unifion ] . for each object",
    ", we calculate the six sb profiles and their respective observed luminosities @xmath255 , which yields a total of 270 data points ( laes ) at each @xmath256 and @xmath257  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "we consider the six sides of a simulation cube as part of six separate observational fields with comoving side of @xmath258  @xmath259 mpc each .",
    "structure in the igm leads to differences in the sb profiles for the six sides ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : run1sb ] ) , which in turn leads to a scatter in the observed lfs calculated from the different fields .",
    "therefore , lfs are calculated separately for each of the observational fields and then averaged in each luminosity bin to obtain the mean luminosity functions , which are shown in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] .",
    "first we focus on @xmath234 , to understand the effects of sb thresholds on detections ( as seen in figure  [ fig : lumdmsb ] ) , and determine the luminosity functions . at @xmath260  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 only one object is detected with an observed luminosity of @xmath261 erg  s@xmath6 , while @xmath193  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 leads to the detection of 5 laes with observed luminosities larger than in the previous case . the lf is thus shifted to higher values in both axis .",
    "going one order of magnitude deeper in sb leads to a huge increase in the number of detections ( @xmath94 laes ) .",
    "this gives rise to a shift in the lf of about two orders of magnitude in both luminosity and number density . at @xmath194",
    "erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 all the flux in all the laes is observed , returning the intrinsic lf of the simulated lae sample .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the value of @xmath4 needed to observe the full flux depends on the intrinsic luminosity of the sources and neutral igm structure around it .        in the real universe ,",
    "both the mean ionization fraction and the intrinsic properties of galaxies change .",
    "this leads to a complex evolution of the lf of laes with redshift .",
    "in addition , the different @xmath4 from real observations add another level of complexity to the redshift evolution of observed lfs . to help in constraining @xmath219 with observations of lfs , here we try to understand how the lf depends on the ionization fraction of the igm for different choices of @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath194  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 , the luminosity functions for different values of @xmath219 are equivalent , because all the flux from the sources is detected . for lower sb cuts instead ,",
    "the number of detections changes with @xmath219 , leading to an increasing number density of laes at a given luminosity for higher @xmath219 .",
    "the difference between lfs at different @xmath219 is higher for smaller values of @xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted that shallow detections ( e.g. @xmath262  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 ) at higher @xmath219 ( e.g. @xmath235 ) have similar lfs as deeper but incomplete detections ( e.g. @xmath263  erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 ) at lower @xmath219 ( e.g. @xmath234 ) .",
    "thus , when comparing luminosity functions at different redshifts , the sb threshold of the observations should be taken into account to obtain a realistic estimate of the decrease in the number density of laes .",
    "another point to note is that discrepancies between lfs for different values of @xmath4 are smaller at higher ionization fractions ( e.g. @xmath235 ) .",
    "thus only mild differences in lfs for orders of magnitude in @xmath4 at a specific redshift can be used as an evidence for high @xmath219 . at high @xmath219 ,",
    "absorption outside the edge of the cube ( as discussed in section  [ sec : unifion ] ) , which has not been included in this test , would lead to an even larger gap between lfs for different @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless one has to keep in mind that velocity shifts discussed in section  [ sec : velshift ] ( e.g. due to outflows from the galaxy ) could also lead to milder changes in luminosity functions with changing @xmath4 .",
    "due to the difficulties in obtaining deep observations of laes ( refer to section  [ sec : results ] ) , we look into the possibility of gathering additional information from stacked profiles .",
    "this was recently done by @xcite at @xmath264 to estimate the low sb extended emission present in individual non - detections .",
    "in addition , also @xcite looked at estimating total ly@xmath0 luminosities from stacked profiles for different mass and luminosity bins . in our study",
    ", we investigate the shape of the stacked sb profiles without binning for halo properties , to understand how the profiles are changed by @xmath219 .",
    "the data set used is the same one discussed above . in general , for @xmath234",
    "the individual profiles show a flatter sb profile with substantial structure due to scattering through a mostly neutral but structured igm . for higher initial ionization fractions ,",
    "the strength of the point source increases as more photons escape with less scattering resulting in a steeper sb profile .",
    "these characteristics can be exploited to study the mean ionization fraction of the universe from stacked lae sb profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : sbstack ] shows the stacked sb maps from the 270 simulated maps of the 45 galaxies described previously .",
    "the top ( bottom ) panels refer to the mean ( median ) values in each pixel of the stack .",
    "the mean value is generally affected by the outliers when the distribution is not gaussian . in our stacks ,",
    "the higher mass haloes act as outliers being brighter and more point - source - like due to larger ionized bubbles around them , but are fewer in number compared to the majority of sb maps of low mass haloes .",
    "this leads to the mean profile being steeper and brighter than the median profile at each @xmath219 .",
    "but it is important to note that in both mean and median stacks , the trend of the stacked sb profiles with @xmath219 is the same .    as we have seen in section  [ sec : unifion ] , the higher @xmath219 is , the steeper is the sb profile of a lae .",
    "this trend is more important for haloes of lower masses , as the ionization bubble around these objects are smaller due to the lower ionizing photon flux , leading to a more diffuse sb profile at low @xmath219 . as @xmath219 increases , a larger fraction of the photons from these haloes escapes unscattered , leading to a more concentrated sb profile .",
    "for high mass haloes , even at low @xmath234 , the photons escape with lesser scatter due to larger ionized regions around them , leading to a steeper sb profile .",
    "due to the shape of the halo mass function though , there is a much larger number of low mass haloes in a comoving volume of the universe .",
    "therefore , when stacking sb profiles of laes in a volume , the average of the stack is dominated by the low mass haloes .",
    "thus the stacked sb profile at low @xmath234 is flat .",
    "the stacked profile has no structural details , because the profiles in individual sb maps have a random distribution , thus averaging out in the stack . at ionization fractions of @xmath265 ,",
    "the photons escape easier in all directions leading to a steeper sb profile in all directions .",
    "this also appears when stacking sb profiles , with the stacked sb profile becoming more concentrated with increasing @xmath219 .",
    "thus this method of stacking can be used to estimate the steepness of the profile and in turn the volume averaged ionization fraction of the universe at that redshift . as already discussed",
    ", the velocity shifts could also lead to the steepening of the individual sb profile even at @xmath234 , thus reducing the difference in concentration between stacked profiles for different @xmath219 . but absorption due to igm outside the cube at @xmath234 would lead to flattening of individual sb profiles .",
    "this would help in differentiating between @xmath219 in stacked sb profiles .",
    "in short , a lot of information about the galaxies and their surrounding igm can be obtained from the deep observations of lae sb profiles .",
    "a more detailed modelling and comparison with observations is the work of a future study .",
    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) is an interesting and important event in the history of the universe , the time being when h in the gas changed from a mainly neutral to a highly ionized state .",
    "the details of the process are still unclear and are the topic of a large number of theoretical and observational studies .",
    "lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) , due to their strong ly@xmath0 emission line which scatters for even tiny amounts of neutral hydrogen , are used as one of the tools to probe the eor .",
    "modelling laes is a complex task with a large number of parameters and scales being important .",
    "different studies either focus on a detailed understanding of individual aspects of laes or use numerical / semi - analytic approaches to model the laes and compare them to observations . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) close to the ionizing / ly@xmath0 source and its effect on the observability of laes due to ly@xmath0 rt .",
    "the igm close to the source is important : the density , temperature and ionization structure controls the ly@xmath0 radiative transfer ( rt ) , determining the intensity and surface brightness ( sb ) distribution along different lines - of - sight .    to achieve this , we simulated a sample of more than @xmath266 laes , using galaxies and surrounding igm extracted from simulation boxes of 5 - 30@xmath267 at @xmath1 .",
    "coupled rt of ionizing and ly@xmath0 photons was performed using crash@xmath0 , to determine the ionization structure carved in the igm by the ionizing photons exiting from the galaxies and the spectrum of the ly@xmath0 photons scattering through the remaining neutral hydrogen along different lines - of - sight .",
    "the outputs were also used to produce ly@xmath0 sb maps for the lines - of - sight perpendicular to the six sides of each simulation cube .",
    "analyses were done to study individual objects as well as statistical trends .",
    "a parameter study was also undertaken to understand the dependence of the results on the different , currently uncertain factors involved in the simulations .",
    "our main results are :    1 .",
    "inhomogeneities in the igm affects ly@xmath0 rt , leading to structure in the simulated sb maps of laes .",
    "the anisotropic escape of ly@xmath0 photons through the igm causes large variations in the total flux in sb maps along different lines - of - sight for the same object .",
    "this leads to @xmath268 more scatter in the observed luminosity - mass relation than the intrinsic one for our sample of simulated laes .",
    "this also leads to a spread in the values for the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons from the igm : @xmath269 .",
    "note that some lines - of - sight , especially through voids , can have @xmath270 due to ly@xmath0 photon contributions from other lines - of - sight by scattering and higher probability of ly@xmath0 photon escape towards the observer through voids .",
    "2 .   observational campaigns have sb thresholds , @xmath4 , which limit the fraction of the flux observed from the sb distribution . at @xmath4 ( e.g. @xmath271 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 ) ,",
    "the observability of the lae strongly depends on the igm ionization structure and velocity field around the objects .",
    "therefore , in observational campaigns at very low @xmath4 , a single detection within the observed comoving volume needs not be that of the most massive lae in the region but could be a lower mass object seen through a biased line - of - sight . at even fainter @xmath4 , more detections are possible , but the observed luminosity values can vary by orders of magnitude for a single object depending on the line - of - sight . to obtain the total flux from the object along each line - of - sight",
    ", one needs unrealistically deep observations at @xmath272 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "thus we find that the impact of sb thresholds on estimates of observed luminosity is very important and needs to be taken into account in the calculation of luminosity functions of laes from observational campaigns ( also see zheng et al .",
    "one of the main factors which affect the ly@xmath0 rt through the igm is the wavelength of the ly@xmath0 photons when they escape from the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) into the igm .",
    "outflows / winds in the ism would redshift the photons reducing their probability of scattering in the igm and aiding the escape of ly@xmath0 photons towards the observer @xcite .",
    "we find that the higher the redshifting of the ly@xmath0 photons before entering the igm is , the more concentrated is the sb profile , making the detection easier at low @xmath4 and improving the observability of laes .",
    "therefore , outflows from the galaxies could weaken the imprint of reionization on the statistics of laes than thought previously .",
    "but due to the uncertainty in the link between the galaxy and outflows , this would add a challenge to estimating the ionization fraction of the igm at high redshifts .",
    "the ionization structure of the igm also plays a very important role in ly@xmath0 rt thus determining the sb profiles .",
    "we estimate the effects of an ionizing background using rt simulations with an initial non - zero uniform ionization level . at low levels of mean ionization in the igm ( @xmath273 ) ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 photons undergo scattered diffusion through the igm and the sb profiles thus produced are more extended and faint , making it harder to observe the total flux from the object . at high levels of mean igm ionization ( @xmath274 ) , the photons scatter less , leading to a more point source - like sb profile , making it easier to detect more flux for low @xmath4 .",
    "clustering of sources also affects the ionization structure around the object by making the region more ionized , but with a complex structure for the ionized bubble due to the distribution of neighbouring ionizing sources and igm gas distribution . the qualitative effect on the sb profiles due",
    "to clustering is similar to that of a uniform ionization case with the same mean ionization level .",
    "but the detailed distribution of flux along different lines - of - sight varies due to the differences in the igm ionization structure .",
    "thus , this shows that proper treatment of the ionization structure in the region is important for better modelling laes .",
    "5 .   due to the difficulty in achieving very high @xmath4 in observational campaigns , stacking of sb maps can be used to extract more information from the current lae samples mapped upto relatively lower @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the mean / median stacked sb profile of laes becomes steeper at higher mean igm ionization levels thus giving an additional technique to use laes to study eor .",
    "but outflow and halo properties among others could also lead to steepening of sb profiles and should to be considered when using this technique .",

    "<S> we perform a systematic study of how the inhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) affect the observability of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) around the epoch of reionization . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the igm close to the galaxies as the detailed ionization distribution and velocity fields of this region could significantly influence the scattering of ly@xmath0 photons off neutral h atoms as they traverse the igm after escaping from the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the surface brightness ( sb ) maps and spectra of more than 100 laes at @xmath1 as seen by an observer at @xmath2 . to achieve this </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the source properties of galaxies and their surrounding igm from cosmological simulations of box sizes @xmath3 and then follow the coupled radiative transfer of ionizing and ly@xmath0 radiation through the igm using crash@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the simulated sb profiles are extended and their detailed structure is affected by inhomogeneities in the igm , especially at high neutral fractions . </S>",
    "<S> the detectability of laes and the fraction of the flux observed depend heavily on the shape of the sb profile and the sb threshold ( @xmath4 ) of the observational campaign . only ultradeep observations ( e.g. @xmath5 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath7  arcsec@xmath8 ) </S>",
    "<S> would be able to obtain the true underlying mass - luminosity relation and luminosity functions of laes . </S>",
    "<S> the details of our results depend on whether ly@xmath0 photons are significantly shifted in the galaxy to longer wavelengths , the mean ionization fraction in the igm and the clustering of ionizing sources . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can lead to an easier escape of ly@xmath0 photons with less scattering in the igm and a concentrated sb profile , similar to the one of a point source . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the sb profiles are steeper at high ionization fraction for the same lae sample which can potentially be observed from the stacked profile of a large number of laes .    </S>",
