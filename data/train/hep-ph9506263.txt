    "the highest energy hadronic interactions currently observable occur when a primary cosmic ray strikes an air nucleus . for primary protons with energy of @xmath2 ev , which are easily observed in the utah `` flys s eye '' detector , the @xmath3 exceeds that of the recently cancelled ssc .",
    "the phenomenology of the extensive air showers created by the hadronic cascade in the atmosphere depends critically on the hadron - nucleus and the nucleus - nucleus cross sections at extremely high energy .",
    "furthermore , extracting any information about the basic hadronic interactions requires some model that can reliably relate the nuclear cross section to the nucleon cross section .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop such a model and check it with experimental data in the energy range in which both the hadron - nucleus and hadron - nucleon cross sections are known .    at",
    "high energies hadron - nucleon scattering amplitudes become very simple .",
    "the amplitude is diffractive being dominated by the imaginary part with rather weak ( logarithmic ) energy dependence .",
    "the momentum transfer dependence in the dominant part of the diffraction peak is a pure exponential .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the situation at lower energies where resonance phenomena produce rapid energy dependence and complicated angular dependence . in this paper",
    "we have resurrected an old model of fishbane and trefil , and of franco@xcite and show that this simple application of the glauber multiple diffraction model@xcite can be used to provide reliable hadron - nucleus cross sections from the basic hadron - nucleon interaction .",
    "we further argue that since no energy dependence is required in this model in fitting the data , i.e. the distribution of nucleons in the nucleus is independent of the momentum of the incident hadrons , this method should continue to be applicable to scattering at the highest cosmic ray energies .",
    "one important reason that the nuclear corrections are simple at high energy is that for large @xmath4 the nucleus is mostly black and only the peripheral shell of the nucleus is sensitive to the details of the hadron - nucleon interaction ; thus the nuclear cross sections depend only weakly on the nucleon density distributions and hadron - nucleon cross sections .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that glauber s approximation is only valid for small scattering angles .    in the next section",
    "we will review the glauber multiple diffraction model for hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus scattering , assuming a gaussian distribution of nucleons in the nucleus . in section iii ,",
    "we determine the input parameters , the hadron - nucleon cross sections and slope parameters for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the two parameters of the nuclear model are then adjusted to fit the corresponding nuclear cross sections as measured by carroll et al .",
    "@xcite    in section iv we obtain simple fits to the energy dependence of the hadron - nucleon parameters and propose a simple model which satisfies partial wave unitarity and can be used to extrapolate these quantities to very high energy .",
    "these extrapolations are then used in section v to calculate the hadron - air and nucleus - air cross sections in the energy range needed in the phenomenology of extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays . in the conclusion",
    "we summarize our results and point out that more hadron - nucleon data are needed to improve our understanding and aid the analysis of cosmic ray showers .",
    "many authors including those listed in @xcite have used the glauber multiple diffraction approximation@xcite to relate hadron - nucleus scatttering and nucleus - nucleus scattering to the basic hadronic interaction . in the interest of making this paper self contained we will review this procedure .",
    "the amplitude for hadron - nucleus elastic scattering can be written in the impact parameter representation as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hadron - nuclear phase shift .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is the scattering amplitude in impact parameter space , often refered to as the nuclear profile function , and is bounded by unitarity because the imaginary part of @xmath8 is positive . in this treatment",
    "we will ignore spin and treat neutrons and protons alike as nucleons .",
    "the essential approximation of the glauber model is that the scattering is predominately forward and there is no momentum transfer to the individual nucloens . in this limit",
    "the nuclear phase shift for a particular nucleon configuration is given by the sum of the phase shifts for the collisions of the hadron with the individual nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "we believe that this should give good results for the total cross section given by the imaginary part of the forward amplitude and for the elastic scattering which is dominated by the forward diffraction peak . on the other hand , the fact that the nuclear amplitude contains no nuclear recoil makes it unlikely that this approximation will give good results for quasi - elastic processes in which the nucleus ends up in an excited state or fragmented . for cosmic ray applications",
    "there are a number of processes that fall into the general catagory of target fragmentation that reduce the beam momentum , but do not contribute to shower formation . since these must be treated in the simulation , we see no particular reason to use the glauber model calculation of the quasi - elastic scattering to remove an ill definited and perhaps incorrect fraction of these events .    if correlations between the nucleons are ignored and we average over the position of the ( a ) nucleons relative to the center of mass of the nucleus , the overall hadron - nucleus phase shift is @xmath10 the contribution of each nucleon to @xmath11 factorizes and we obtain @xmath12^{a}\\ } \\eqnum{2.3}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the single nucleon density , @xmath14 is the component of @xmath15 in the impact parameter plane and @xmath16 is the hadron - nucleon profile function which is just the bessel transform of the hadron - nucleon scattering amplitude : @xmath17 all of the scattering processes are at a fixed incident hadron momentum .",
    "being able to neglect the nuclear fermi momentum is another simplification that is possible at high energy .",
    "the multiple diffraction approximation can also be applied to nucleus - nucleus scattering@xcite ( see also refs . @xcite and @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the overall phase shift is , according to the glauber assumption , simply the sum of the phase shifts of @xmath18 individual nucleon - nucleon interactions . in this case",
    "we must average over the positions of the nucleons in both nuclei .",
    "unlike the hadron - nucleus case , however , the integrals do not factorize and lead to very complicated expressions even for the 2@xmath193 case .",

    ". while other distributions such as saxon - wood are probably more realistic for large @xmath4 and shell wavefunctions are more appropriate for small @xmath4 , this form seems to work very well .",

    "2.6 and 2.7 can be evaluated analytically .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 has the following form : @xmath30 if we use experiment to determine @xmath16 , the only free parameters in this model are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these could of course depend both on energy as well as particle type , although the simplest picture is one in which the density only reflects the average positions of the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the hadron - nucleon elastic amplitude at small momentum transfer are well fit by a gaussian form .",
    "more complicated dependence appears at larger angles , but it is the simple small angle region that makes the dominant contribution to the elastic cross sections .",
    "this remains the case up to the highest experimental energies available at the tevatron collider .",
    "the form of the scattering amplitude is then @xmath33 where b is the slope parameter @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "here we have assumed that for small @xmath36 , @xmath35 is a constant . at high energy @xmath35",
    "is quite small , typically 0.10 - 0.14 , and we take it to be zero in our work .",
    "the resulting hadron - nucleus absorptive cross section is @xmath37 and the total cross section is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 finally , we include the prediction for the quasi - elastic scattering . while we are doubtful about its reliability , it turns out be be small and we will be force to use it in our fit to accelerator data .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42    the nucleus - nucleus cross sections can be obtained from eqs . 2.11 and 2.12 by letting @xmath43 and using @xmath44 and @xmath45 the following identity@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is euler s constant , can be used to evaluate these cross sections for large @xmath4 or @xmath48 .",
    "up to this point we have neglected position correlations of the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "indeed , the nucleon coordinates @xmath49 are subject to the center of mass constraint @xmath50 .",
    "it can be easily shown , by transforming to the cm coordinates @xmath51 , that the effect of the cm constraint on the elastic scattering amplitude , for the case of gaussian nucleon density distributions , is simply @xmath52 @xmath53 thus the total cross sections are unaffected by the cm constraint .",
    "the inelastic and elastic cross sections however are modified , although as it is shown in fig.1 the correction is at most a few mb and decreases as @xmath54 .",

    "( hereafter the egls model ) @xcite and discussed in more detail by fletcher et al.@xcite is based in part on the work of durand and pi @xcite , which is a semi - classical treatment motivated by the parton model .",
    "the egls model is a probabilistic approach to hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus inelastic scattering , treating the individual hadron - nucleon interactions incoherently , and summing probabilities of interaction instead of amplitudes . while this treatment is somewhat different from ours , for the special case of purely imaginary nuclear phase shift the results are identical .",

    "the only free parameters in our model are @xmath76 and @xmath32 that appear in the nucleon density distribution .",
    "the most recent hadron - nucleus data is due to carroll et al.@xcite .",
    "the comparison of our model with their data is complicated by the fact that they removed the quasi - elastic cross section from their absorption cross section . while this is a small correction to the absorption data it was done in the process of extrapolating the data to zero momentum transfer and",
    "hence we can not obtain the total absorption cross sections from their published data . as a result",
    ", we have two courses of comparison .",
    "first , we can simply ignore these small corrections and fit their data with our model .",
    "the alternative is to use the glauber model to calculated the quasi - elastic cross sections .",
    "this has the disadvantage of subtracting a small but unreliable term from the quantities that we believe can be calculated accurately .",
    "we first ignore the quasi - elastic cross sections and simply fit the 108 data points of carroll et al.@xcite for scattering of @xmath77 off li , c , al , cu , sn , and pb targets at 60 , 200 , and 280 gev incident hadron energy with our two free parameters .",
    "these results are shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "we obtain , @xmath78 @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "this @xmath81 was calculated using the quoted error of the data which includes an estimated systematic error of 3% .",
    "the small value of our @xmath81 is an indication that our fit is not sensitive to the type of systematic error that exists in the data .",
    "if we use only the statistical error of 1% as quoted by carroll et al.@xcite to calculate @xmath81 we obtain a @xmath81 @xmath82 per degree of freedom .",
    "if we use the glauber model to remove the quasi - elastic scattering from our fit , we obtain , @xmath83 @xmath84 with @xmath85 . while this is not as good a fit as the one described above , it is quite acceptable .",
    "note that there is a noticeable change in the parameters .",
    "the data for the total nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath62 and nuclear slope @xmath68 up to tevatron energies @xcite can be fit with quadratic logarithmic forms and at infinite energy they grow as @xmath86 .",
    "our fits , shown in figs .",
    "4 and 5 are : ( @xmath60 is in gev@xmath61 , @xmath62 in mb and @xmath68 in gev@xmath69 ) @xmath87 and @xmath88 where we have assumed that at @xmath0 and @xmath89 are identical at collider energies .",
    "note that for @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , the unitarity limit is saturated at @xmath92 tev ( see fig . 6 ) . to prevent unitarity violation",

    "the nucleus - nucleus case can be obtained as before , in the optical limit , by substituting @xmath43 and @xmath107 . as it is shown in fig . 6 for @xmath108 ,",
    "the @xmath109 profile function remains unchanged for small impact parameter , ( saturating the unitarity limit for large @xmath4 ) but increases at large @xmath110 , due to the smearing of the nucleon - nucleon profile function .",
    "this results in an increase of the total and inelastic @xmath109 cross sections , as shown in fig .",
    "7 . in these plots",
    "we have used the minimum value of @xmath111 that satisfies unitarity .",
    "our model of course is by no means unique since there may be other ways to preserve unitarity .",
    "the choice of the bessel function is not essential and other modifications such as exponentials etc .",
    "should produce the same qualitative results .",
    "the development of cosmic ray showers in the atmosphere depends strongly on the size of the relevant hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus cross sections at very high energies @xmath112 ev , @xmath113 tev .",
    "both the interaction length in the atmosphere and the number of nucleons in the nucleus that participate in a collision are a function of the absorption cross sections .    in the previous sections we have shown that the hadron - nucleus cross sections can be calculated reliably from the basic hadron - nucleon interaction . since glauber s analysis does not depend explicitly on the energy scale at which the scattering takes place we expect that it is still applicable at very high energy . on the other hand , only for @xmath114 does experimental data approach modest cosmic ray energies .",
    "even this data at @xmath115 tev ( @xmath116 gev ) must be extrapolated over three decades in energy to reach the highest cosmic ray energies of @xmath117 gev .",
    "because of the observed logarithmic behavior of the cross section and slope parameter , this procedure should be fairly reliable and data that will eventually come from the lhc should provide direct input for all but the very highest energies .",
    "the situation for the @xmath118 and @xmath119 interactions is much less satisfactory .",
    "data for these reactions exist only up to a few hundred gev lab energy with little hope of future measurements above the tev range even with the lhc .",
    "while external beam experiments up to the tevatron s maximum energy would improve our understanding of these reactions , it is unlikely that energy extrapolations over 7 or 8 orders of magnitude can be trusted , which means that the forms given in eqs .",
    "3.1 through 3.4 can not be used at cosmic ray energies .",
    "it appears that the best method for determining @xmath118 and @xmath119 scattering at cosmic - ray energies is to use the independent quark model result    @xmath120    although this is only approximately true at low energy , it is expected to improve at very high energy .",
    "the hadronic nuclear slopes are taken equal .",
    "these approximations are probably adequate considering the fact that the hadron - nucleus cross - sections are relatively insensitive to the precise value of @xmath59 and @xmath58 as it is shown in figs . 8 and 9 for @xmath121 . in fig .",
    "7 we plot our prediction for the @xmath121 cross section as a function of center of mass energy and compare with a fit by block and cahn of @xcite . based on theoretical arguments they assumed that the total proton - proton cross section has the form @xmath122 the parameters from their fit are @xmath123 mb , @xmath124 mb , @xmath125 gev@xmath61 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 mbgev@xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "the nucleus - nucleus cross sections can also be calculated at cosmic ray energies based on the nucleon - nucleon interaction using eqs . 2.11 and 2.12 with the appropriate substitutions .",
    "however , there are not enough experimental data on nucleus - nucleus cross sections to check whether the glauber model works as well as in the hadron - nucleus case , especially since for practical purposes one is forced to use the optical limit approximation .",
    "we have shown that glauber s model of multiple diffraction accurately predicts hadron - nucleus cross sections from the basic underlying hadron - nucleon interaction .",
    "we have obtained excellent agreement with the experimental data for a variety of incident hadrons and target nuclei in the energy range of 60 - 280 gev with just two free parameters .",
    "external beam experiments at 800 gev on nuclear targets would provide a useful check of the validity of these methods over a much broader range of energies . since glauber s analysis does not depend explicitly on the energy scale of the scattering process and it is unlikely that the distribution of nucleons inside a nucleus would change with energy , we expected this method to continue to be applicable at very high energies .",
    "the @xmath130 data extend to a large energy range and can be extrapolated to cosmic ray energies . using glauber s model we",
    "can then obtain the relevant nucleon - nucleus cross sections at these energies .",
    "we can use the independent quark model to estimate the @xmath131 and @xmath132 cross sections , but have not yet developed a model for the nuclear slope .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that extrapolating our fits to available data on @xmath133 and @xmath134 to energy @xmath3 greater than a few tev violates unitarity .",
    "this means that above the current tevatron energies and the energy available at the lhc we should expect some change in the shape of the nucleon diffraction peak and its related profile function .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the behavior at lower energies where the gaussian profile function height and radius have grown logarithmically with s.    we propose a simple model in which the p - p elastic scattering amplitude deviates from a pure exponential in the momentum transfer and satisfies unitarity .",
    "the resulting absorption cross sections are increased appreciably at cosmic ray energies .",
    "how nature actually chooses to satisfy unitarity awaits experiments in the few tev energy range .",
